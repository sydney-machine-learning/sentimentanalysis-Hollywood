His heart rate is dropping

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,812
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,439

I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

sovereign ruler of the
kingdom of Wakanda.

44
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,627
Mr. Chairperson,

45
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:04,216
I believe I speak for all
the member states here

46
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,094
when I say that I am
deeply disappointed

47
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,263
in Wakanda's failure

48
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,809
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

49
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,978
to tackle international
challenges,

50
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,563
to share resources,

51
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,857
and full cooperation

52
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,400
concerning vibranium.

53
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,711
I now give the floor

54
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,713
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

55
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,681
It has always been our policy

56
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:57,770
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

57
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,149
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

58
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:07,821
but because of the
dangerous potential of you.

59
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:52,116
You perform civility here.

60
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,202
But we know what you whisper

61
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,579
in your halls of leadership

62
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,541
and in your military facilities.

63
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,673
"The King is dead.

64
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,428
"The Black Panther is gone.

65
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,599
"They have lost their protector.

66
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,734
"Now is our time...

67
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,361
"to strike."

68
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,432
Aneka, where is your spear?

69
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,017
Shuri gave me these to try.

70
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,646
You know, I like them better.

71
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,398
Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

72
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,151
because it is
precise, elegant...

73
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,862
and deadly.

74
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,159
It will not change
under my watch.

75
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,537
Yes, General.

76
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,956
I told you not to bring them.

77
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,961
Last night there
was another attack

78
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,547
on one of our
outreach facilities.

79
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,302
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

80
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,389
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

81
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,393
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

82
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,625
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

83
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,127
be an olive branch.

84
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,091
Further attempts
on our resources

85
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,469
will be considered
an act of aggression

86
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:21,181
and met with a much
steeper response.

87
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,352
We mourn the loss of our king.

88
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,772
But do not think for a second

89
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,149
that Wakanda
has lost her ability

90
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,777
to protect our resources.

91
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,073
We are aware of the
ongoing efforts by some

92
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,326
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda,

93
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,664
and wish you the best of luck.

94
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,546

Yeah.

98

99

100
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,227
I thought I had too.

101
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,521
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

102
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,772
of finding vibranium.

103
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,940
Oh, less than that.

104
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,922
Here we go.

Perfect. So, Salazar,

113
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,836
you are near the
site right there.

114
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,215
<i>Yeah, it's astonishing.</i>

115
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,551
<i>The drill seemed to make contact</i>

116

<i>Whatever it is, it's solid.</i>

118
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,684
<i>I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.</i>

119

Vibranium in the ocean.

121
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,567
Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,

122
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,403
since it's the only
one we've got.

123
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,864
<i>Heading towards the
vibranium detector.</i>

124
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,961

00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,255
<i>Yeah. The rig lost power.</i>

126

<i>No. He's gone.</i>

138

00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,231
Okay. They're gone!

164
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,441
Oh, my God!

165
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,086
Just get us out.

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,629
We're good.

167
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,047
We're good.

168
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,257
Where is the strike team?

169
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,634
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... They were blue.

170
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,802
Everyone is dead...

171
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,430
Shit. What is going on?

172
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,349
We're getting pulled backwards.

173
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,935

00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,858

00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,452
<i>from an undisclosed
illness last year.</i>

184
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,787
<i>All eyes are on the
tiny, powerful nation,</i>

185
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,457
<i>as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...</i>

186
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,711
Approaching the river border.

187
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,719
We are home.

188
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,978
<i>Princess.</i>

189
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,105
Just a moment.

190
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,523
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,233
<i>I understand,
Princess, however...</i>

192
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,026
You're disrupting
my train of thought.

193
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,447
Shuri.

194
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
Mother.

195
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,158
<i>I was trying to tell you.</i>

196
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,244
<i>The Queen is here.</i>

197
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,454
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

198
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,789
I think that one day

199
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,166
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

200
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,086
My AI isn't like
the movies, Mother.

201
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,879
It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

202
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,549
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

203
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,469
Everyone seems to
be working diligently.

204
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,682
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

205
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,475
There could be any number of

206
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,227
unknown threats on the horizon,

207
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,979
and they're creating solutions.

208
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,023
Oh, what is this?

209
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,817
Exo Suits for our army.

210
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,403
It grants the user
super-human strength,

211
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,655
speed, and durability.

212
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,158
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

213
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,492
What were her notes?

214
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,952
She hates them.

215
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,036
Oh.

216
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,668
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

217
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,962
Have you made
any progress on that?

218
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,255
<i>Excuse me, Princess.</i>

219
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,550
<i>Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.</i>

220
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,634
<i>Maybe you should...</i>

221
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,470
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

222
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,721
as I instructed.

223
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,306
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

224
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,350
We do not need the Herb, Mother.

225
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,395
We need new technology.

226
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,730
What of the Black Panther?

227
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,612
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

228
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,864
The Black Panther
is a relic, Mother.

229
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,450
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the Herb,

230
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,702
I was trying to save my brother.

231
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,164
Oh, Shuri.

232
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,679
Do you know what day it is?

233
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,764
Tuesday.

234
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,558
The date, child.

235
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,066
Brother's passing.

236
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,026
One year ago today.

237
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,246
Have you planned anything?

238
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,250
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

239
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,252
- Right now?
- Right now.

240
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,546
And you can leave
your Kimoyo Beads here.

241
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,755
- Mother.
- No, no.

242
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,674
You won't need them
where we are going.

243
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,426
Hmm?

244
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,390
And the other two. Yes.

245
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,001
You need to sit here
with me. And with yourself.

246
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,670
It is the only way
you are going to heal

247
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,089
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

248
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,465
I'm fine, Mother.

249
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,844
You don't have
to worry about me.

250
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,724
He's gone, but
I'm moving forward.

251
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,642
T'Challa is dead,

252
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,604
but that doesn't
mean he is gone.

253
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,982
When that illness took
your brother from us,

254
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:05,653
I had to lead a wounded
nation and a broken world.

255
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,531
But I still took
time in the bush.

256
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,951
I wandered until I found water.

257
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,494
And I sat.

258
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,789
Then I did this ritual

259
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,334
that I am about to show you now.

260
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,132
I found your brother
in the breeze,

261
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,803
pushing me gently, but firm.

262
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,973
Like his hand on my shoulder.

263
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,810
It took some time,

264
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,147
but he was there.

265
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,780
He wasn't there, Mother.

266
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,033
The presence that you felt

267
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,035
was just a construct
of your mind.

268
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,999
Brought on so you could
feel some comfort or joy.

269
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,126
That's all.

270
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,879
Hmm.

271
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,886
What construct
does your mind create

272
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,013
when you think of your brother?

273
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,933
Does it offer you comfort?

274
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,686
Or torment?

275
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,450
Come, child.

276
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,213
How did you get this?

277
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,506
What does it matter?

278
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,134
What does this have
to do with your ritual?

279
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,637
Burning of the funeral garments

280
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,056
marks the end of
the mourning period

281
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,143
and the beginning
of a new relationship

282
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,478
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

283
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,564
I'm not doing this, Mother.

284
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,275
If I sit

285
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,986
and think about my
brother for too long,

286
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,282
it won't be these
clothes I'll burn.

287
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,076
It will be the world...

288
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,037
and everyone in it.

289
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,373
Shuri...

290
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,756
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

291
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,549
about your brother.

292
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,096
Mother, wait!

293
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,640
What are you doing?

294
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,334
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

295
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,752
It isn't.

296
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,047
Stop! Right there!

297
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,550
Who are you? And
how did you get in here?

298
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,595
This place is amazing.

299
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,598
The air is pristine.

300
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,059
And the water...

301
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,729
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

302
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,233
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

303
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,735
That never have to
change who they were.

304
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,404
What reason do you have

305
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,281
to reveal your
secret to the world?

306
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,326
I am not a woman who
enjoys repeating herself.

307
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,370
Who are you?

308
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:43,746
I have many names.

309
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,458
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

310
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,088
but my enemies call me Namor.

311
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,425
The American military
detected vibranium

312
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,094
under my nation's domain.

313
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,640
I was able to stop
them from minin' it,

314
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,851
but we need Wakanda's help

315
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,686
to prevent it from
happenin' again.

316
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,773
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

317
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,442
Vibranium only exists here.

318
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,944
In Wakanda.

319
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,487
Mother, he's covered in it.

320
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:24,120
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

321
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,998
In response, other
nations have begun

322
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,499
searching the planet for it.

323
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,086
His choice has compromised us.

324
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,256
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

325
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,632
and bring them to me?

326
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,387
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

327
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,015
You do not sneak into my country

328
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,809
and tell me what is fair.

329
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,355
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

330
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,859
And they have
incomparable strength.

331
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,487
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

332
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,954
When you have the
scientist, blow into this,

333
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,456
place it in the ocean.

334
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,917
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

335
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,671
For your own sake,

336
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,090
don't mention anything about me

337
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,967
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

338
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,603
Did you see the
wings on his ankles?

339
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,204
How did he do that?

340
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,581
We must convene the Council.

341
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,210
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence

342
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,003
of any activity at all.

343
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:02,927
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

344
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,470
If my soldiers were present,

345
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,098
this "fish man"

346
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,100
would be bound
before us as we speak.

347
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,435
If your muscle
brains were present,

348
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,895
they would still be there

349
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,772
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

350
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,107
You bald-headed demon...

351
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,067
Show some respect, you two.

352
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,235
Respect?

353
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,821
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

354
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:22,989
Watch your tone, Jabari!

355
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,962
As I was saying,

356
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,923
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

357
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,341
And nothing on
the radar as well.

358
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,970
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

359
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,638
He was not alone.

360
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,016
And claims to command
a massive army.

361
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,395
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

362
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,521
So he can kill them?

363
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,689
Do it.

364
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,776
We never had to face an enemy

365
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,611
with access to vibranium before.

366
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,573
And we have no Black
Panther to protect us.

367
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,283
That is because
this wise Council

368
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,952
allowed Killmonger
to take the throne

369
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,079
and burn up all of your
precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

370
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:14,665
M'Baku, what would
you have us do?

371
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,209
We should find the
fish man and kill him.

372
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,964
If we do what he
is asking for now,

373
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,550
what is to stop him
from coming back

374
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,427
and asking for more?

375
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,896
As you were.

376
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:42,735
Is it just me, or does
this keep getting uglier?

377
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,070
It's you.

378
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,781
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

379
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,365
This thing can detect

380
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,659
the altered
frequency of vibranium

381
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,954
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

382
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,831
Whoever built this is brilliant.

383
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,583
Come, look.

384
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,836
Some are custom
parts and others look like

385
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,755
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

386
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,174
I am still struggling to believe

387
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,219
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

388
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,638
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

389
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,515
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

390
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,682
so it's reasonable

391
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,810
that the other one
just landed there.

392
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,062
This changes
everything that we know.

393
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,690
The Great Mound. All
of the legends and fables.

394
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,276
Those stories are
seared in my mind.

395
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,237
That sounds very painful.

396
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,533
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

397
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,869
- I do have an idea.
- Mm.

398
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:35,996
I'm going to need the princess.

399
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,165
Out of the question.

400
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,459
She is in no state
to be in the field.

401
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,381
It may do her some
good to get out.

402
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,509
It might just be
exactly what she needs.

403
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,012
Besides, I can do this
American operation

404
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,180
with my eyes closed.

405
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:56,475
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

406
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,060
This Namor,

407
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,479
he snuck past our defenses.

408
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,565
That will never happen again.

409
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,233
He was not alone.

410
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,152
She'll be with me.

411
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,404
So,

412
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,447
when are we leavin'

413
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,700
so I can see my
favorite colonizer?

414
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,587

00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,422

421

Come on.

422
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,317
Yeah, I got it.

423
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,611
I got it.

424
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,114
Will you slow down?

425
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,372
You didn't think to call?

426
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,916
Now, why would I
have your number?

427
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,794
We are looking for the scientist

428
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,671
who built the
vibranium detector.

429
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,381
So it was you
guys in the Atlantic?

430
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,092
Come on. Mining ship.

431
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,510
Lot of casualties.

432
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,221
What happened?

433
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,430
Seriously?

434
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:21,310
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

435
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:24,438
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

436
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:25,606
friends of mine.

437
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,066
Gone.

438
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,275
Just like that.

439
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,735
You throw in the fact

440
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,819
that they were
tracking vibranium...

441
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,572
I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

442
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,574
So who was it?

443
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,036
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

444
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,247
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

445
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,999
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

446
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,252
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

447
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,920
before anything else happens.

448
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,506
You owe me, Ross.

449
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,174
You owe my brother.

450
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,012
Okay, look.

451
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,057
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

452
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,309
for less than I'm
about to give you now.

453
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,727
And we got a new director.

454
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:05,771
She's watching me like a hawk.

455
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,524
We will be very, very careful.

456
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,776
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

457
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,444
The US needs another machine

458
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,113
and this kid is the
only person in the world

459
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,447
who knows how to build one.

460
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,573
So they're comin' for her.

461
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:17,491
A kid?

462
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,753
- Hey.
- You forgot to Venmo me.

463
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:33,090
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

464
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,925
Eight hundred was
yesterday's price.

465
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,176
It's a band today.

466
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,970
That's predatory. I...

467
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,931
I built the whole robotic hand.

468
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,559
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

469
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,102
And what grade did you get?

470
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,568
Thanks.

471
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,739
Is that an iPhone I see?

472
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,823
Primitive.

473
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,203
We have located the scientist.

474
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,039
She is in the
American equivalent

475
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,874
of a Wakandan village school.

476
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,167
<i>A school?</i>

477
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,086
<i>Please tell me
it is a professor.</i>

478
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,047
It's a student, Mother.

479
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,631
We can't give her to Namor.

480
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:18,135
<i>Bring this student
back to Wakanda.</i>

481
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,767
I've got it from here.

482
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,186
Wait. Maybe I
should speak with her.

483
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,645
It will be more discreet.

484
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,065
I can be discreet.

485
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,819
What?

486
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,404
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

487
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:38,489
No.

488
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:39,698
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

489
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,866
It's the right shade.

490
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,534
Fenty 440. You look good.

491
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,121
I can blend in as a student.

492
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,248
I can do this.

493
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,587
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

494
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,850
Yo!

495
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,102
Riri Williams?

496
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:13,065
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

497
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,233
You gotta go to the website.

498
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,611
It's an encrypted file.

499
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:18,946
I wanted to airdrop it.

500
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,281
You the...

501
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:23,826
Whew.

502
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,494
You're Princess Shuri.

503
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,664
What the hell are
you doing here?

504
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,457
Oh, shit, am I
getting recruited?

505
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,252
No.

506
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,587
I'm here about the
vibranium detector

507
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,172
that you built for the CIA.

508
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,843
I ain't built no
detector for no CIA.

509
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,594
I made that for my
metallurgy class.

510
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,763
- A school project?
- Yeah.

511
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,932
My professor said I'd
never be able to do it.

512
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,602
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

513
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,899
Y'all probably don't
say that in Wakanda.

514
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,236
How old are you?

515
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,488
Nineteen.

516
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,157
Brilliance at a young age

517
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,784
is not always
accepted by the elders.

518
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,787
How long did it take you?

519
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,038
Couple months.

520
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,874
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

521
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,792
finding big enough mylar
sheets to cover the...

522
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,087
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

523
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,255
Not just us.

524
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,340
This place is no
longer safe for you.

525
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,635
Gather your things and
come with me. Right now.

526
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,514
I got Differential Equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

527
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,018
Okay.

528
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,312
Okay.

529
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,689
You wait right here.

530
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,193
I'm gonna go to the
bathroom. I'm just gonna...

531
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,611
Ooh!

532
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,281
I had it under control.

533
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,701
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

534
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,536
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

535
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,371
Get out!

536
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,539
Hey.

537
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,542
I'm warning you! Do
not take another step

538
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:56,627
- toward me!
- Oh!

539
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,878
See how they teach the children

540
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,254
to treat their guests? Mm!

541
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,259
Oh...

542
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,677
You brought a spear in here?

543
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,138
You brought a spear in here.

544
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,973
I like her.

545
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:11,642
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

546
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,227
- Put it down, put it...
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

547
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,895
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

548
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,647
It's all right, Princess.

549
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,065
Small, small girl.

550
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:22,069
I am going to give
you two options.

551
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,404
You can come to Wakanda,

552
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,865
conscious or unconscious.

553
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:30,410
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

554
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,538
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

555
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,500
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

556
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,044
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

557
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,879
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

558
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,714
And she can deal

559
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,467
with that merman
with the winged ankles

560
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,554
who wants to kill
her all by herself.

561
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,847
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

562
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,182
Come on. Let's go.

563
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,934
What?

564
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,943
What exactly is this place?

565
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,654
I fixed a few trucks for
the head of sanitation.

566
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,242
He lets me work out of
this garage in exchange.

567
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,327
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

568
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,833
Please don't touch anything.

569
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,127
You don't have to
worry about that.

570
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:21,712
It may not look like much,

571
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,797
but it's my life's work in here.

572
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,881
Mm-hmm.

573
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:28,385
So, the design for the
machine is on that laptop?

574
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,553
Yeah.

575
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,598
And you just leave it on
a desk in a car garage?

576
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,726
I got 2065-byte
encryption on that thing.

577
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,021
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

578
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,106
Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

579
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,317
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

580
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,402
just to crack my own encryption.

581
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,946
What is it you're building
here? Is it Stark Tech?

582
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,448
I said don't touch anything.

583
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,241
<i>Princess, American
law enforcement</i>

584
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,701
<i>has arrived at your location.</i>

585
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,244
- Shit.
- Who was that?

586
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,662
My AI.

587
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,749
They are surrounding us.

588
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,380
I thought you said a
merman was after me.

589
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,590
That's the feds.

590
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,481
Oh, I do not need
this shit right now!

591
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,775
I swear to God, I
was doing so well!

592
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,569
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

593
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,280
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda

594
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:32,032
is gonna show up at my doorstep

595
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,742
and then shit about to pop off.

596
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,826
I think

597
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,579
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

598
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:41,375
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

599
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,961
Hey. Namor sank an entire
ship of CIA operatives...

600
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,463
<i>This is the Federal Bureau</i>

601
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,547
<i>of Investigation.</i>

602
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,674
Because of your little machine.

603
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,133
So those popo out there...

604
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,343
<i>We have surrounded the premises.</i>

605
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,511
Are the very least
of your worries.

606
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,138
Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

607
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,724
General, they've
got us surrounded.

608
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,476
Maybe we should just split up.

609
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,061
Out of the question.

610
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,354
Does this vehicle work?

611
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:04,940
No.

612
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:09,236
Everything in this lab
works. Including this bike.

613
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,238
Don't even think about it.

614
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,407
Besides, there are three of us.

615
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,034
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

616
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,661
Whoo!

617
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,995
I knew it.

618
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,581
Don't tell me that you
built this in two months.

619
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:24,710
I spent years on
this. On and off.

620
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:27,671
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

621
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:28,964
That thing can fly?

622
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,007
There's an entire
You Tube channel

623
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,884
dedicated to sightings of me.

624
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,052
That's awesome.

625
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,804
<i>We have a warrant to detain...</i>

626

Wireless transmitter,

628
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,100
so we can communicate.

629
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,309
Don't try to scurry off.

630

633
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,526
Hey, please be careful.

634
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,902
<i>You will not be
placed under arrest.</i>

635
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:51,987
Keys are on the seat.

636
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,697
Once we get to the
other side of the bridge,

637
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,031
we can lose them
in Boston traffic.

638
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,992
General, we really
need to split up.

639
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,244
Listen to me. We
are not in your lab.

640
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,412
We are in the field.

641
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,997
Now, get her in the car.

642
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,707
Always shouting at me.

Oh, shit! She got

649

- Fall back!
- Stay where you are!

650
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,026

00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,486

Come on, Riri.

697
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:30,145
You gotta find these

698

699
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,065
Riri, I'm not sure you
can reach that drone

701
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,530
<i>Oxygen level is now 55%.</i>

702
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,617

<i>Oxygen level is now 30%.</i>

706
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,462

720
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,418
Whoo!

721
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,466
Riri!

722
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,579
What just happened? Shuri!

723
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:13,123
Shuri!

724
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,474
<i>The Princess's vitals
are stable, General.</i>

725
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,227
<i>She should regain
consciousness momentarily.</i>

726
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,764
Take another step closer

727
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,058
and I will kill you all.

728
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:14,976
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

729
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:24,694
Hey, is she blue?

730
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,575
Drop your weapon!

731
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,752
Okoye!

732
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,254
Wait!

733
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:49,714
<i>Activating interpretation.</i>

734
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:50,965
I'm Shuri.

735
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,342
Princess of Wakanda.

736
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,594
I demand that you
take me to Namor.

737
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,846
Do not bring harm to this girl.

738
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,643
<i>Do we take them both alive?</i>

739
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:04,229
<i>Yes, Attuma.</i>

740
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,663
<i>Breathe.</i>

741
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,589
Shuri!

742
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,694
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

743
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,071
None. But we think it
was the Wakandans.

744
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,447
Excuse me?

745
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:57,657
Our field office got
a tip from Langley

746
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,741
that they were coming.

747
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,702
Right. Who made that call?

748
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,121
- She did.
- Director de Fontaine.

749
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,916
Director de Fontaine.

750
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,001
Really?

751
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,085
Well...

752
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,963
Uh, Agent thinks it
was the Wakandans.

753
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,007
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

754
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,091
since they took out our ship.

755
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,592
That's why I wanted you here.

756
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,761
You're lookin' good.

757
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,430
Oh. Well, I try.

758
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,098
You put that home gym in?

759
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,182
Yeah. Last year.

760
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,060
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

761
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:27,812
Howdy.

762
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,647
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

763
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,899
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

764
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,235
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

765
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,528
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

766
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,739
Um, we think it was a car crash,

767
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,657
but we're having
trouble finding the cars.

768
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:40,783
What do you mean?

769
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,160
It was just like this
when you found it?

770
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,870
Yes. We think someone involved

771
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:44,954
got rid of the vehicles.

772
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,205
Got rid of them how?

773
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,749
They dumped them into the river.

774
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,125
You're kidding me.

775
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,753
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

776
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,297
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

777
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:56,549
Hey, Ross? You
got a full tank of gas?

778
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,384
Can you give me a
ride back to Langley?

779
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,678
It's an eight-hour drive.

780
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,138
Yeah. We can
talk about the case.

781
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,682
Actually, wouldn't mind...

782
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,934
Apologizing to you for
a couple of things I said

783
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,061
during our marriage.

784
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:12,690
They were blue.

785
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,568
And they had
superhuman strength.

786
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:19,322
And they came from the
water on the backs of whales.

787
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,866
I struck down three of them

788
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,409
with blows that
should've killed them,

789
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,203
but they rose again.

790
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,623
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

791
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,636
Okoye,

792
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,430
you will be
stripped of your rank

793
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:46,516
as General of Wakanda's armies

794
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,560
and your status as Dora Milaje.

795
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,903
You may.

796
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,325
I have given everything.

797
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:09,080
Let me die saving my
country and that throne.

798
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,209
Allow me to make this right.

799
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,585
"Make it right"?

800
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:19,340
I do not know if my
daughter is alive or dead.

801
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,760
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

802
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:24,178
Mmm.

803
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:29,225
She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.

804
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,936
Where is her
treacherous husband now

805
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:36,399
but in a place where she
can visit if she wished? Mine...

806
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,569
is with the ancestors.

807
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:44,449
I am Queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

808
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,827
and my entire family is gone!

809
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:51,456
Have I not given everything?

810
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,550
On your feet, General.

811
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,933
I stood by you

812
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,729
after Killmonger
took the throne,

813
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:18,483
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

814
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:22,278
while I ran begging to
the Jabari for protection.

815
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,072
And I warned you

816
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:28,034
about taking my
daughter on this mission,

817
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,119
and you lost her.

818
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,371
So, today,

819
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,458
I am done.

820
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:24,090
Are you here, GRIOT?

821
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,676
<i>Yes, my Queen.</i>

822
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,097
Were you with Shuri
when she was abducted?

823
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,557
<i>I was.</i>

824
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,476
Are you able to track
her Kimoyo Beads?

825
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:38,062
Ballistics found slugs
all over Cambridge.

826
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,231
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

827
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,315
Hmm.

828
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,150
I can't see how they
figured out who built it.

829
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:45,653
That information
is highly classified.

830
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,907
What is that?

831
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,409
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

832
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,829
Uh, Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

833
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,122
It's enough with the titles.

834
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,373
Just take it. I don't care.

835
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,666
Hey, honey sweetheart.

836
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,376
Ooh.

837
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,004
Uh, no, I'm... I'm
with my boss. Now.

838
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,089
Actually, she's leaving.

839
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:06,257
All right.

840
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,884
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

841
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:17,768
Everett Ross.

842
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,061
Queen Ramonda?

843
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,188
What are you doing with
Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

844
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:23,232
I didn't know they
were hers. All right?

845
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:25,568
I just found them at a
pretty ugly crime scene.

846
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:27,737
Do you have the student?

847
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,574
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

848
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:33,951
What? Taken by who?

849
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,580
My agency assumes it was you.

850
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,707
And I'm worried they
might be onto the fact

851
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,043
that I pointed Shuri and
Okoye in the right direction.

852
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,919
Look, if they're in
danger, I wanna help.

853
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,921
But I can't if I don't
know what's going on.

854
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,799
I am afraid there is a
new world power at play.

855
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,177
A country that's
already on our radar?

856
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,261
Or you mean someone else?

857
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,347
<i>That is all I can say for now.</i>

858
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,514
Please,

859
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,601
alert me if your
government decides to act

860
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,269
on their suspicions.

861
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:01,520
Yeah. Sure.

862
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:06,108
Uh, look, if there's anything I
can do to help, let me know.

863
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,069
I owe Shuri my life.

864
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,740
GRIOT, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?

865
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,451
<i>I lost track of them
in the North Atlantic,</i>

866
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:18,788
<i>but the people who took
her spoke Yucatec Mayan.</i>

867
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,921
- Hmm?
<i>- Oui,</i> Miss Nakia.

868
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,641
Queen Mother.

869
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,770
Everything is a lesson
here for the children.

870
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:27,940
They painted the
walls, they feed the fish,

871
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,401
and they grow
everything we eat here.

872
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,195
I recognize some
of the concepts here.

873
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:35,322
But you are using
different material.

874
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,826
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

875
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:44,165
You were missed
at T'Challa's funeral.

876
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,294
Oh...

877
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,136
Queen Mother.

878
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:00,264
It's been six years
since you left us.

879
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:03,601
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

880
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,855
I was afraid

881
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:12,526
of how final the
funeral would be.

882
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,654
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,

883
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:20,826
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,

884
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:24,622
and you know
death is not the end.

885
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,510
How is everyone at home?

886
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,012
Shuri has been taken.

887
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,722
What?

888
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,142
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

889
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,896
I was a different person then.

890
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,024
I need someone who can
find where she is being held,

891
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:55,236
and rescue her,
without being seen.

892
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,447
Who on earth would
risk war with Wakanda?

893
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:01,909
Oh, my God.

894
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,285
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

895
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:04,829
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

896
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
Where the hell are we?

897
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,290
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

898
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:09,375
Oh, my God!

899
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,502
What is that?

900
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:14,421
Glow worms. Their
larva gives off light.

901
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,423
Just calm down.

902
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,717
Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther

903
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:20,052
that you can call
to come and get us?

904
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,136
No.

905
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,221
Why not?

906
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,098
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

907
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:26,433
The Black Panther is gone.

908
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:28,185
So y'all stopped
having Black Panthers

909
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,270
when I get kidnapped?

910
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,535
Do you understand her?

911
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,203
Not completely.

912
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,498
Nuh-uh.

913
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:52,001
That is some
supervillain shit right there.

914
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,502
That's in every movie.

915
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:54,920
Princess Leia.

916
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,338
Belle from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

917
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,049
That white chick
from <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

918
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,259
It's fine.

919
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,887
You should see what I
have to wear at Warrior Falls.

920
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,730
Wait.

921
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:15,274
You're not leaving
me in here, are you?

922
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,817
I'm coming back.

923
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,694
I'm coming back.

924
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,779
Stay calm.

925
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,452
Princess.

926
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,619
Welcome.

927
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,041
Please, feel free.

928
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,591
This is beautiful.

929
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,177
That was my mother's.

930
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,773
These are all
Mesoamerican artifacts.

931
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,109
Most likely 16th century.

932
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,529
Have you been alive since then?

933
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,033
Your mother was human.

934
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:13,494
She was.

935
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,871
Then she became something else.

936
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,082
- How?
- "How?"

937
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,126
"How" is never as
important as "why."

938
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,847
<i>My mother and her village</i>

939
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,516
<i>were driven from their farms</i>

940
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,436
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

941
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,481
a hateful language, and
dogma from another world.

942
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,984
Facing starvation,

943
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,986
war, and disease,

944
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,239
my people turned to Chaac...

945
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,784
our god of rain and abundance.

946
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,831
<i>Chaac gave our
shaman a vision...</i>

947
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,583
<i>a way to save his people.</i>

948
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:09,967
<i>Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.</i>

949
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,649
<i>My mother was pregnant
with me at the time,</i>

950
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,068
and she did not want
to ingest the plant

951
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,445
for fear of what
it may do to me.

952
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,491
But the Shaman was convincing.

953
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,192
<i>They all fell sick.</i>

954
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,195
<i>And their lives,</i>

955
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,488
<i>their existence there,</i>

956
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:14,948
<i>ended.</i>

957
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:29,087
<i>The plant took away
their ability to breathe air</i>

958
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:33,050
but enabled them to
draw oxygen from the sea.

959
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,138
<i>They settled in the ocean,</i>

960
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,934
away from war and diseases.

961
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,257
My mother gave birth to me there

962
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,802
<i>and I became the
firstborn son of Talokan.</i>

963
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,346
<i>The plant gave me
wings on my ankles</i>

964
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,932
<i>and ears that
pointed to the clouds.</i>

965
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:23,642
I was a mutant.

966
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,813
I could swim in the
sky and age slower.

967
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,482
Breathe the air our
ancestors breathed.

968
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,318
<i>As she grew older,</i>

969
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:38,240
<i>my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...</i>

970
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,910
and died with a broken heart.

971
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,290
She made me promise

972
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:48,625
to bury her in the
soil of her homeland.

973
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,675
Nothing could prepare
me for what I found there.

974
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,311
Huh?

975
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:45,015
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

976
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,059
As he died by my hand,

977
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,268
<i>he called me...</i>

978
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,901
The child without love.

979
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,903
And I took my name from there.

980
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,993
<i>"Namor."</i>

981
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,996
<i>Because I have no love
for the surface world.</i>

982
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,084
Why are you
telling me all of this?

983
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:16,630
So that you can understand
why I have to kill the scientist.

984
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:18,382
What if we took her to Wakanda?

985
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:20,967
Let us go.

986
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,387
I give you my word.

987
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,013
She will remain in my country.

988
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,681
I cannot risk that, Princess.

989
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,475
Then keep me instead.

990
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,062
I'd love to see your nation.

991
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:36,024
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

992
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:41,530
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

993
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,949
Your blood will become toxic

994
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:45,450
and the pressure of the ocean

995
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,953
will break every
bone in your body.

996
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,290
Or you can wear a suit.

997
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,459
We have some of them. Come on.

998
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:58,547
Stay close.

999
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,571
<i>Hey! Namor, wait!</i>

1000
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:50,742
<i>Whoa!</i>

1001
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,613
<i>Hello.</i>

1002
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:39,309
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1003
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,479
<i>It's made of vibranium.</i>

1004
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:43,647
Yes.

1005
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,315
In the depths of the ocean,

1006
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:47,984
I brought the sun to my people.

1007
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,196
I know you wished me

1008
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,531
to spare the life
of the scientist.

1009
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:56,159
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1010
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,061
<i>Nakia, your hunch was correct.</i>

1011
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:26,231
<i>I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.</i>

1012
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,225
<i>The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern</i>

1013
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:05,854
<i>approximately 140
meters below the surface.</i>

1014
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,773
Queen Mother,
I've found her signal.

1015
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,067
It's coming from
an underwater cave.

1016
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,069
If she's down there,

1017
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:14,779
I'm sure I'll
encounter resistance.

1018
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,657
<i>How would you
like me to proceed?</i>

1019
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:22,954
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

1020
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:26,332
I will attempt to
draw Namor out.

1021
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,911
You are the first
person from the surface

1022
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,496
to come to Talokan.

1023
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,540
Please take this as a
token of our gratitude.

1024
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,300
It was made with the
plant that saved Talokan.

1025
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,471
You are young, Princess.

1026
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:25,266
When you age
as I do, you realize

1027
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:28,186
we all lose everyone we love.

1028
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:29,938
But when I lost my brother,

1029
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,731
it just felt different.

1030
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:33,566
He suffered in silence.

1031
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,153
When he finally asked
me to help him, I couldn't.

1032
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:39,948
How does that make sense

1033
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:44,577
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1034
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,497
to help me save my
brother, and I couldn't?

1035
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:49,999
Why?

1036
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,963
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1037
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,634
My ancestors would often say,

1038
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,429
"Only the most broken
people can be great leaders."

1039
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,352
I admire what you
have built here.

1040
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,107
And how you've
protected your people.

1041
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,944
But as princess of Wakanda,

1042
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,572
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1043
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:25,368
My nation will not
rest until I'm returned.

1044
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,913
I'm not leaving without her.

1045
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:33,376
We need to find a
peaceful way to resolve this.

1046
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,756
It is no longer
about the scientist.

1047
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,468
For centuries,
the surface nations

1048
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:45,346
have conquered and
enslaved people like us.

1049
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:47,473
Over resources.

1050
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,144
Since the day I
buried my mother,

1051
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,937
I have prepared my people

1052
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:55,148
for the time they
will come for us.

1053
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:59,527
And that machine is the
sign that the time is now.

1054
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:06,743
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1055
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,037
There is no in-between.

1056
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,876
So you plan to wage
war on the entire world,

1057
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,795
and you want
Wakanda to help you?

1058
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:19,881
That's madness.

1059
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:23,051
There isn't a nation that
wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1060
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,677
if given a chance.

1061
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,931
If we make an alliance,

1062
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,808
we can protect each
other by striking them first.

1063
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:35,605
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1064
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,399
the scientist will be
returned to Wakanda.

1065
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,611
And if Wakanda does
not accept, what then?

1066
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,656
The scientist will die.

1067
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:48,576
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1068
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,370
An attack on my people?

1069
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,163
Yes.

1070
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,707
And I want you to listen to me.

1071
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,835
Wakanda cannot win
a war with Talokan.

1072
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:11,891
I heard you that night,

1073
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,977
with your mother at the river.

1074
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,022
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

1075
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:25,697
Let us burn it together.

1076
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,498
Queen Ramonda

1077
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,250
won't sell us any vibranium.

1078
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,544
And now they abducted
a young woman

1079
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,878
who built the machine.

1080
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,338
Yeah, with all due respect,

1081
01:20:42,422 --> 01:20:44,048
Riri Williams is a child prodigy

1082
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:46,342
who was running circles
around all of her professors.

1083
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:47,969
The Wakandans
were recruiting her

1084
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,387
as part of their
outreach program.

1085
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,972
Nothing more. And then,

1086
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:53,516
you guys send in a SWAT
team under cover of night

1087
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:55,685
to arrest the Crown Princess

1088
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,103
of an international superpower.

1089
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,941
The President wants
to take offensive action

1090
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,067
against Wakanda.

1091
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,362
What type of offensive action?

1092
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,614
Destabilization.

1093
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:13,119
Well, Special Officer
Ross is our expert.

1094
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,496
So, Ross, what do you think?

1095
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,165
My sources are telling me

1096
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:18,458
that there's someone
else out there.

1097
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,294
- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.

1098
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,378
You've gotta give me enough time

1099
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:23,546
to investigate this properly,

1100
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,757
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1101
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,759
with a country whose
military capacity

1102
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,802
we can't even comprehend.

1103
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,388
Director?

1104
01:21:32,847 --> 01:21:35,099
I think he's the expert.

1105
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,186
I think it would be a
mistake to attack Wakanda.

1106
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:45,985
<i>Yes?</i>

1107
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:46,944
We have a problem.

1108
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,968
Is my daughter alive?

1109
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,096
The princess is alive and well.

1110
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:16,641
She requested to
be taken to Talokan.

1111
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:19,185
She will remain there
for the time being.

1112
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:26,067
What can I offer
you in exchange?

1113
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:27,485
Nothing.

1114
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,654
I beg to differ.

1115
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:33,491
The Americans are
preparing to blame Wakanda

1116
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,119
for your attack on
their mining ship.

1117
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,247
Return my daughter
and the scientist

1118
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,000
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1119
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,843
If you tell the
Americans about us,

1120
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:55,513
if you try to find us,

1121
01:22:56,597 --> 01:23:00,393
or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1122
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,645
I will kill the princess.

1123
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,982
I will come to Wakanda

1124
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:08,109
and I will kill you.

1125
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,494
So, what happened?

1126
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:23,374
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1127
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,334
and asked me to help him.

1128
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,257
I need to think.

1129
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:34,093
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

1130
01:23:43,144 --> 01:23:44,145
Ey!

1131
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:08,544
Shuri...

1132
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:16,802
Are you okay?

1133
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:18,971
Are you okay?

1134
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:20,473
- Give me your Beads!
- Let's go.

1135
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,016
Give me your
Beads. I can save her.

1136
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,100
We have to go.

1137
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,393
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

1138
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:25,561
but we need to listen to her.

1139
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,896
Listen, I hit her
with a sonic round.

1140
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,315
It is lethal from this
distance. There is no chance.

1141
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,275
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1142
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,778
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1143
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:18,406
Did they hurt you?

1144
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,116
No. No.

1145
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:22,868
Thank you.

1146
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,581
- GRIOT.
<i>- Yes, my Queen.</i>

1147
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:29,709
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1148
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,054
Princess, it is good
to have you back.

1149
01:28:29,597 --> 01:28:31,390
The city has been
on edge since you left.

1150
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:33,309
Go.

1151
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:36,061
Fortify the sonic
barriers for all waterways.

1152
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,229
Princess?

1153
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:39,148
Neka.

1154
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:43,486
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1155
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:47,031
I just wanted to return these.

1156
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,409
No. Keep them.

1157
01:28:50,576 --> 01:28:52,077
Might need them soon.

1158
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,997
Did you get that
from down there?

1159
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:01,337
Is it true you saw an
underwater empire?

1160
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,340
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1161
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,592
It is beautiful.

1162
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,471
But these people are
dangerous, Aneka.

1163
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,014
Mm.

1164
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:33,452
So, Miss Riri Williams,

1165
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,372
what do you think of Wakanda?

1166
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:38,541
The stories just don't
do this place justice.

1167
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:42,711
It's great.

1168
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,630
But I really would
like to go home.

1169
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:47,675
You will need to be patient.

1170
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,885
Can I at least call my mom?

1171
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,726
The Princess has
been brought home

1172
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,603
by the War Dog Nakia.

1173
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,146
Glory to Hanuman.

1174
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,690
Glory to Hanuman.

1175
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:07,319
Mm. The spy saves
Wakanda once again.

1176
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,363
The Queen will reward her

1177
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,032
with lifetime
banishment. I'm sure of it.

1178
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:15,953
Okoye.

1179
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:22,835
<i>After Thanos' attack,</i>

1180
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:25,421
when you left
without saying a word,

1181
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,214
it hurt.

1182
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:34,597
I regret not being
there with all of you.

1183
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,391
It was not easy.

1184
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,184
He was...

1185
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:43,689
King and Black
Panther to everyone.

1186
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,525
But to me...

1187
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:53,991
He was everything.

1188
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:57,828
My T'Challa.

1189
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:02,124
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1190
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,752
I had to step away

1191
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,296
and let myself break.

1192
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,175
I couldn't just...

1193
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:15,512
keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1194
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:18,307
Mm-hmm.

1195
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:34,323
We are under attack.

1196
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:43,290
Here.

1197
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,634
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1198
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,594
GRIOT, activate the <i>Sunbird.</i>

1199
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:56,929
Shuri, where are you?

1200
01:31:57,096 --> 01:31:58,555
Making my way to
the city right now.

1201
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,182
Stand down! That is an order!

1202
01:32:00,349 --> 01:32:02,643
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1203
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,186
<i>Aneka, do not let
her leave the lab.</i>

1204
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:05,354
Mother, you're...
you're breaking up.

1205
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:06,438
- We can't hear you.
<i>- Shuri!</i>

1206
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:07,523
Love you. Bye!

1207
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:10,943
You just hung up on the Queen.

1208
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:12,111
I just hung up on my mom.

1209
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,862
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1210
01:32:46,103 --> 01:32:48,188
Invaders!

1211
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:56,989
Mama! Mama!

1212
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:06,415
<i>EMTs are suffering</i>

1213
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:08,292
<i>a form of sonic hypnosis.</i>

1214
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:14,131
<i>General, plug your ears.</i>

1215
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,382
Yes, my Queen.

1216
01:34:01,804 --> 01:34:03,931
- Can I help?
- Come, quickly.

1217
01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:15,609
Cross your arms...

1218
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:22,366
Nakia.

1219
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:38,048
The fish man.

1220
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,167
<i>Phambili!</i>

1221
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,449
Shit, he's too fast.

1222
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:28,533
He's even faster in the water.

1223
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:55,936
- Activating system override.
- No.

1224
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:57,020
Wait! I'll fix it.

1225
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:58,689
Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1226
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:16,498
Do you see her?

1227
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:17,958
Yes. Right there.

1228
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:33,140
Go, child.

1229
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,475
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1230
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:36,560
Run!

1231
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:52,701
Okoye, move now!

1232
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,520
She did this.

1233
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:06,733
In one week's time,

1234
01:39:06,817 --> 01:39:09,486
I will return with
my entire army

1235
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:12,906
and you will join us
against the surface world,

1236
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:16,034
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1237
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:19,996
Mother.

1238
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,165
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

1239
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,210
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

1240
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:27,504
Mourn your losses.

1241
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:32,425
You are queen now.

1242
01:39:32,676 --> 01:39:33,677
Mother!

1243
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:35,387
No!

1244
01:39:38,557 --> 01:39:40,100
Get off of me! Mother!

1245
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:42,727
Mama!

1246
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:51,611
Mama!

1247
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:53,113
Mama!

1248
01:39:53,697 --> 01:39:54,865
Mother!

1249
01:40:02,414 --> 01:40:03,748
Help me!

1250
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,208
Mama!

1251
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:14,843
Mama!

1252
01:40:55,550 --> 01:41:00,722
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1253
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:09,022
You must mourn her

1254
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:13,109
in accordance to the
rituals of your ancestors.

1255
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,905
Do not bury yourself
in your technology.

1256
01:41:17,072 --> 01:41:18,323
Why are you here?

1257
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,910
I promised your brother

1258
01:41:22,077 --> 01:41:24,371
that I would provide
you with counsel

1259
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:25,956
and protection.

1260
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:30,627
But I am in need of
your advice today.

1261
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:36,216
Your tribal elders
have approached me

1262
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:38,093
with a proposition.

1263
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:42,764
They wish to evacuate
the city and set up camp

1264
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:44,432
in Jabariland.

1265
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,769
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1266
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,105
who scoffs at tradition?

1267
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:52,148
Mm.

1268
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:55,318
The world...

1269
01:41:57,237 --> 01:41:59,906
The world has taken
too much from you

1270
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:03,910
for you to still be
considered a child.

1271
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:08,957
It is in my people's
interest to know

1272
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,501
which way your mind is leaning.

1273
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:15,088
The elders are desperate.

1274
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:18,633
The city is vulnerable.

1275
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:23,013
If you are to provide for them,

1276
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:26,391
they will be in
great debt to you.

1277
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:30,186
And what of your heart?

1278
01:42:31,313 --> 01:42:32,314
Hmm?

1279
01:42:33,732 --> 01:42:35,734
Which way is your heart leaning?

1280
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,572
I just buried the last
person who truly knew me.

1281
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,744
My heart was buried with her.

1282
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:23,740
Oh, man.

1283
01:43:24,616 --> 01:43:26,534
Yeah, your olive
oil's about to go bad.

1284
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:27,702
What... What are you doing here?

1285
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:30,538
I'm hungry. And...

1286
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,957
<i>Tragedy strikes the
international community.</i>

1287
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:34,209
<i>Sources can now confirm</i>

1288
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:37,253
<i>that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.</i>

1289
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,464
<i>Western allies
say that civil conflict</i>

1290
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:41,591
<i>was the likely cause
of the Queen's...</i>

1291
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,136
So...

1292
01:43:45,512 --> 01:43:46,846
You have any comment?

1293
01:43:49,015 --> 01:43:52,185
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1294
01:43:52,394 --> 01:43:54,020
What are you talking about?

1295
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:57,690
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1296
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:02,278
What about the Beads?

1297
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,572
What?

1298
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:05,740
The Beads.

1299
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:07,033
I had them bugged

1300
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,868
before you ever even got there.

1301
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:12,872
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1302
01:44:12,956 --> 01:44:15,625
including that treasonous
call with the Queen.

1303
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:17,168
May she rest in peace.

1304
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:18,878
But it's good.

1305
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:20,088
Well, for us.

1306
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:22,966
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1307
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:25,093
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

1308
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:27,220
You ever thought for a second

1309
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:29,013
what they could be doing?

1310
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,598
Ever thought what
we would be doing

1311
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:33,893
if the US was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1312
01:44:34,144 --> 01:44:38,440
Oh, I actually dream about that.

1313
01:44:41,276 --> 01:44:42,944
Val. Val, please.

1314
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:44,946
It's Director de Fontaine.

1315
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:50,994
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1316
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:54,747
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1317
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,461
We need to find a
way to weaken Namor.

1318
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,796
Even weakened, he's
still gonna be a problem.

1319
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:05,383
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1320
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:08,136
I thought the Black
Panther was gone.

1321
01:45:17,854 --> 01:45:19,189
My brother is dead.

1322
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,526
But it doesn't mean the
Black Panther is gone.

1323
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:42,837
GRIOT?

1324
01:45:43,004 --> 01:45:45,632
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1325
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,592
between our attempts at creating

1326
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,385
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1327
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,057
and the fibers
from this bracelet.

1328
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:55,934
<i>Yes, Princess.</i>

1329
01:45:59,229 --> 01:46:01,981
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1330
01:46:03,233 --> 01:46:05,485
they may share some
base-level similarities

1331
01:46:05,568 --> 01:46:06,694
that we can exploit.

1332
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,154
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

1333
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:14,869
Please upload my
brother's DNA also.

1334
01:46:15,036 --> 01:46:16,162

Why doesn't he look like them?

1342
01:46:49,237 --> 01:46:51,447
His physiology is
completely different.

1343
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:54,284
None of them fly or have
pointed ears like him.

1344
01:46:54,784 --> 01:46:55,785
The women that were guarding us,

1345
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:56,869
they had water over their mouths

1346
01:46:56,953 --> 01:46:58,663
and on their necks.

1347
01:46:58,746 --> 01:46:59,747
He didn't have that.

1348
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,333
Several organisms
don't need gills

1349
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:05,336
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1350
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:07,046
It's like a jellyfish.

1351
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:11,009
He just absorbs the
oxygen from his skin.

1352
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,344
It's a process called

1353
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:14,637
- diffusion.

Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1362
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,291
is a day wasted.

1363
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:45,043
We must deal with Namor

1364
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:46,878
before he brings his
warriors back here.

1365
01:47:47,045 --> 01:47:49,714
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1366
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,383
In that attack, before
he took out your plane,

1367
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:53,718
he jumped back into the water.

1368
01:47:53,885 --> 01:47:55,637
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1369
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:57,722
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1370
01:47:57,805 --> 01:47:59,349
from the water on his skin.

1371
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:01,559
If we could find a
way to dry his ass out,

1372
01:48:01,643 --> 01:48:02,769
he won't be as strong.

1373
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,354
Yo, that's it.

1374
01:48:04,437 --> 01:48:07,649
GRIOT. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1375
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:09,275
into a pervaporation chamber.

1376
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:10,526
Is that even possible?

1377
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:11,861
Yes.

1378
01:48:13,363 --> 01:48:15,281
You're going to
help us trap him.

1379
01:48:16,115 --> 01:48:18,117
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1380
01:48:18,284 --> 01:48:19,827
Right this way.

1381
01:48:23,665 --> 01:48:24,666
<i>How old were you</i>

1382
01:48:24,749 --> 01:48:26,167

1383
01:48:26,334 --> 01:48:27,418
<i>Three.</i>

1384
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:31,047
<i>My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.</i>

1385
01:48:31,214 --> 01:48:33,675
<i>He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.</i>

1386
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:39,889
<i>So who taught you
how to do all that you do?</i>

1387
01:48:40,223 --> 01:48:41,474
<i>My big brother.</i>

1388
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:47,855
I was the tip of the
spear of Wakanda's army.

1389
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,441
This is not me.

1390
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:53,111
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1391
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,571
I turned in my weapon.

1392
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,865
I built you a new spear as well.

1393
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:00,743
A new one?

1394
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:01,953
Yes.

1395
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,665
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

1396
01:49:05,832 --> 01:49:07,291
The Midnight Angel.

1397
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:08,918
Midnight Angel?

1398
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:14,048
This will even the
odds against them.

1399
01:49:14,215 --> 01:49:16,676

1406
01:49:32,692 --> 01:49:34,652
I looked for you at
the Jabari outpost.

I won't be forced

1408

01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:48,684
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1429
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:53,731
So...

1430
01:50:55,024 --> 01:50:57,985
this is what you've been up to.

1431
01:50:58,778 --> 01:50:59,946
Yes.

1432
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:02,031
What you have here, now,

1433
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:07,495
is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.

1434
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:13,000
It would be the greatest gift

1435
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:15,795
since Bashenga's discovery.

1436
01:51:20,925 --> 01:51:23,177
We'll soon find out. Come.

1437
01:51:26,305 --> 01:51:27,765
- GRIOT?
<i>- Yes, Princess.</i>

1438
01:51:27,849 --> 01:51:28,933
Print it.

1439
01:51:33,104 --> 01:51:34,814
How will we know if it works?

1440
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,858
If it glows.

1441
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:52,999
I mean, shouldn't we be

1442
01:51:53,082 --> 01:51:54,375
burning incense or something?

1443
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:56,085
Only Bast knows

1444
01:51:56,168 --> 01:51:58,170
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1445
01:52:08,514 --> 01:52:10,349
Are you sure you don't
want me to bury you?

1446
01:52:10,516 --> 01:52:11,517
No.

1447
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:14,145
Need you to have
access to my chest,

1448
01:52:14,312 --> 01:52:16,355
just in case I go
through cardiac arrest.

1449
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:18,482
"Cardiac arrest"?

1450
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:20,610
She's joking,

1451
01:52:21,152 --> 01:52:22,403
right?

1452
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:25,406
Right?

1453
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:34,206
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb

1454
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:37,627
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther

1455
01:52:38,044 --> 01:52:40,463
and take you to
the Ancestral Plane.

1456
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,751
Mother?

1457
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:15,349
N'Jadaka.

1458
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:17,101
Lil' cousin.

1459
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:18,477
How?

1460
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:21,397
How is never as
important as why, right?

1461
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,442
You chose me.

1462
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:27,486
Impossible. I would
never choose you.

1463
01:54:27,653 --> 01:54:29,321
Why did you take the Herb?

1464
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:32,283
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

1465
01:54:33,242 --> 01:54:35,161
You didn't believe the
Ancestral Plane was real,

1466
01:54:35,244 --> 01:54:36,245
did you?

1467
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:40,374
No.

1468
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:42,376
So, why did you take it, then?

1469
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,463
You don't have to lie to me.

1470
01:54:46,297 --> 01:54:47,798
So I can be strong.

1471
01:54:48,174 --> 01:54:49,675
Strong to do what?

1472
01:54:52,553 --> 01:54:53,554
See?

1473
01:54:55,097 --> 01:54:57,058
We're more alike than you think.

1474
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:00,936
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

1475
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:02,271
I'm nothing like you.

1476
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:05,483
You took it for yourself,

1477
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,193
then destroyed the rest.

1478
01:55:08,694 --> 01:55:09,904
Unworthy king,

1479
01:55:10,738 --> 01:55:12,239
afraid of being replaced.

1480
01:55:13,324 --> 01:55:14,325
Just a coward.

1481
01:55:14,492 --> 01:55:15,493
No.

1482
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:16,619
I had the courage to do

1483
01:55:16,702 --> 01:55:18,245
what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1484
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:21,165
How many people
like your scientist

1485
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:23,626
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1486
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:25,669
Cowards.

1487
01:55:25,836 --> 01:55:28,089
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1488
01:55:29,173 --> 01:55:30,174
and before T'Challa.

1489
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,093
Don't mention my brother.

1490
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:34,095
You're the reason why he's dead.

1491
01:55:34,595 --> 01:55:37,848
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1492
01:55:38,015 --> 01:55:40,267
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1493
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:42,269
Their blood is on your hands.

1494
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:44,772
That ain't on me.

1495
01:55:45,314 --> 01:55:46,690
And don't you dare

1496
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:48,692
take that away from your mother.

1497
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,444
She sacrificed
her life to protect

1498
01:55:50,528 --> 01:55:52,363
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

1499
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:56,408
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1500
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,662
He would've killed that girl.

1501
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:02,289
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1502
01:56:03,874 --> 01:56:06,544
T'Challa was too noble.

1503
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,048
He let the man who
murdered your father live.

1504
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,844
And here you stand.

1505
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:22,643
Are you gonna be
noble like your brother

1506
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:24,895
or take care of business...

1507
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:26,730
like me?

1508
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:30,568
Are you okay?

1509
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:37,533
Who did you see?

1510
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:44,039
No one.

1511
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:50,337
I failed.

1512
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,631
- It didn't work.
- Hey, Shuri.

1513
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,137
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1514
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,763
I did everything I
was supposed to do.

1515
01:56:59,847 --> 01:57:01,682
- I re-created the Herb.
- Okay.

1516
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,809
I just did your stupid
ritual, and for what?

1517
01:57:03,976 --> 01:57:05,519
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1518
01:57:05,603 --> 01:57:06,729
Just relax.

1519
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,112
Shit.

1520
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:20,784
Can I get some of that too?

1521
01:57:28,209 --> 01:57:29,251
I think...

1522
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,254
you're going to need a suit.

1523
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:05,871
There are more people
coming from the city.

1524
01:58:05,955 --> 01:58:07,581
They need more space.

1525
01:58:07,748 --> 01:58:08,749
So what?

1526
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:11,877
You are visitors.

1527
01:58:12,044 --> 01:58:15,256
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1528
01:58:40,406 --> 01:58:42,700
The princess!

1529
01:59:16,233 --> 01:59:17,526
She has done it!

1530
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:21,238
The Black Panther lives!

1531
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:41,508
Namor believes
Wakanda is on her knees.

1532
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:45,429
Our Queen murdered.

1533
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:49,475
Our capital destroyed.

1534
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:52,978
He believes we
have no protector.

1535
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:55,981
But now...

1536
01:59:57,775 --> 01:59:59,777
now is our time to strike.

1537
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:03,530
How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

1538
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:05,824
We'll bring Namor to us.

1539
02:00:05,991 --> 02:00:07,534
- Here, again?
- No.

1540
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:10,037
A distant location at sea.

1541
02:00:10,204 --> 02:00:11,622
All right.

1542
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:13,165
Let's say this does work.

1543
02:00:14,458 --> 02:00:17,211
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

1544
02:00:17,378 --> 02:00:20,422
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1545
02:00:23,175 --> 02:00:25,594
is murdering him
the right solution?

1546
02:00:26,053 --> 02:00:28,013
You were calling for his head

1547
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,516
when his only crime
was intimidation.

1548
02:00:30,682 --> 02:00:32,476
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1549
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:33,852
His soldiers

1550
02:00:34,019 --> 02:00:35,729
did not call him
General or King.

1551
02:00:35,813 --> 02:00:38,482
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1552
02:00:38,649 --> 02:00:39,858
What is that?

1553
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:42,152
The feather serpent god.

1554
02:00:42,736 --> 02:00:43,737
What?

1555
02:00:43,821 --> 02:00:45,823
Do you think because we
are living in the mountains,

1556
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:47,866
we do not have access to books?

1557
02:00:48,117 --> 02:00:49,618
Elders,

1558
02:00:50,035 --> 02:00:51,412
with your permission,

1559
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:55,290
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1560
02:01:05,426 --> 02:01:06,760
Namor's not finished.

1561
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:11,265
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1562
02:01:11,432 --> 02:01:13,767
Now is our
opportunity to take him.

1563
02:01:13,934 --> 02:01:16,186
- What are you afraid of?
- War.

1564
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:19,940
If Namor is indeed
a god to his people,

1565
02:01:20,107 --> 02:01:22,734
killing him will
risk eternal war.

1566
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:23,986
And so what?

1567
02:01:24,528 --> 02:01:26,864
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

1568
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:28,407
Of course it was.

1569
02:01:29,408 --> 02:01:33,495
Of course she was.

1570
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:38,709
But it is not what she
would have wanted for you.

1571
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:40,961
Hmm?

1572
02:01:44,173 --> 02:01:45,883
And it is not what I want...

1573
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:50,262
for my people.

1574
02:02:00,606 --> 02:02:03,650
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1575
02:02:04,568 --> 02:02:06,570
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

1576
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:09,948
Her hopes and her dreams.

1577
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:14,620
But she's dead.

1578
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:16,663
She's gone!

1579
02:02:18,373 --> 02:02:22,252
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

1580
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:24,963
So, her dreams,

1581
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:28,217
her goals, her hopes for me...

1582
02:02:31,553 --> 02:02:32,804
it doesn't exist.

1583
02:02:35,516 --> 02:02:37,059
It doesn't matter anymore.

1584
02:02:39,144 --> 02:02:42,022
What matters is what I want,

1585
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,900
and what I want is Namor dead!

1586
02:02:48,904 --> 02:02:50,572
And you're going
to help me get it.

1587
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:08,465
We leave in the morning.

1588
02:03:34,283 --> 02:03:35,284
Hi.

1589
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,451
Good morning.

1590
02:03:39,079 --> 02:03:40,289
If we survive this,

1591
02:03:41,957 --> 02:03:45,168
I want you to know you
have a home with me in Haiti.

1592
02:03:48,005 --> 02:03:50,340
Here. Take my hands.

1593
02:03:59,016 --> 02:04:01,518
Shuri, I want you to
be honest with me.

1594
02:04:01,685 --> 02:04:04,730
Who did you see when
you took the Herb?

1595
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:11,612
If you go to war for vengeance,

1596
02:04:11,695 --> 02:04:14,197
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

1597
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:16,658
It will only grow larger,

1598
02:04:16,825 --> 02:04:18,285
and it will consume you.

1599
02:04:20,537 --> 02:04:21,913
It already has.

1600
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:52,587
For the Queen.

1601
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,497
<i>Phambili!</i>

1602
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:08,413
<i>Riri, how's it going up there?</i>

1603
02:07:08,914 --> 02:07:10,165
<i>Hey, Mr. GRIOT.</i>

1604
02:07:10,248 --> 02:07:11,708
I could really use
that backup right now.

1605
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:13,835
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

1606
02:07:19,633 --> 02:07:20,634
<i>Shit.</i>

1607
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:26,473
<i>Shit, he's fast.</i>

1608
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,350
<i>But I'm faster.</i>

1609
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,565
Whoo!

1610
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:49,371
<i>I got you.</i>

1611
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:57,045
<i>It's on you now, Shuri.</i>

1612
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:07,597
- Princess.
<i>- No.</i>

1613
02:08:08,098 --> 02:08:11,601
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1614
02:08:12,269 --> 02:08:15,272
<i>Pervaporation cells activated.</i>

1615
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:25,699
What's wrong?

1616
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:27,742
You need a glass of water?

1617
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:33,456
- Yo, we got him.
- Good!

1618
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,833
Namor has been captured.

1619
02:08:40,964 --> 02:08:42,465
Back to Wakanda!

1620
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:49,180
Move out!

1621
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:16,166
What is going on?

1622
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,126
The sonic emitter
has been destroyed.

1623
02:09:40,357 --> 02:09:41,858
That can't be good.

1624
02:10:13,974 --> 02:10:16,142
<i>Panther, the</i> Sea
Leopard <i>has lost power,</i>

1625
02:10:16,226 --> 02:10:18,269
<i>and they are experiencing
significant casualties.</i>

1626
02:10:19,813 --> 02:10:20,814
Okoye.

1627
02:10:20,981 --> 02:10:22,232
<i>Panther.</i>

1628
02:10:22,357 --> 02:10:23,358
<i>Phambili!</i>

1629
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:24,442
Aneka.

1630
02:10:25,694 --> 02:10:26,695
Okoye!

1631
02:10:26,778 --> 02:10:28,154
It is time.

1632
02:10:32,742 --> 02:10:34,119
Phambili!

1633
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:40,083
For Wakanda!

1634
02:10:40,792 --> 02:10:42,002
<i>Wakanda!</i>

1635
02:10:50,343 --> 02:10:51,886
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1636
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:52,971
<i>Catastrophic.</i>

1637
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,431
<i>His spear is made
of raw vibranium.</i>

1638
02:10:54,514 --> 02:10:55,932
<i>The ship could
explode at any second.</i>

1639
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:57,017
Get us to the desert.

1640
02:11:15,827 --> 02:11:17,120
<i>No!</i>

1641
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:15,553
I got you, sis.

1642
02:12:15,637 --> 02:12:16,721
<i>Hold on.</i>

1643
02:14:00,909 --> 02:14:02,118
<i>Get off me!</i>

1644
02:14:14,172 --> 02:14:15,381
<i>All right, come here.</i>

1645
02:14:45,995 --> 02:14:47,747
May the ancestors save us

1646
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:49,457
if the princess does not hurry.

1647
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:51,251
We may be going to join them.

1648
02:14:52,168 --> 02:14:53,253
If so, hey,

1649
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:55,672
let us take as many of
them with us as we can.

1650
02:15:25,785 --> 02:15:27,203
It could've been different.

1651
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:51,185
<i>Are you gonna be noble</i>

1652
02:15:51,269 --> 02:15:52,270
<i>like your brother</i>

1653
02:15:52,353 --> 02:15:53,688
<i>or take care of business</i>

1654
02:15:53,855 --> 02:15:54,897
like me?

1655
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:56,607
I'm not my brother.

1656
02:15:58,026 --> 02:16:00,028
Namor will beg me for mercy

1657
02:16:00,695 --> 02:16:03,239
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1658
02:16:46,699 --> 02:16:48,409
Wakanda forever!

1659
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:38,561
Shuri.

1660
02:18:40,104 --> 02:18:41,105
Mama.

1661
02:18:44,066 --> 02:18:45,359
Show him

1662
02:18:45,735 --> 02:18:47,278
who you are.

1663
02:18:54,118 --> 02:18:55,119
Yield,

1664
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:58,664
and Wakanda will
protect your oceans.

1665
02:18:58,831 --> 02:19:01,083
We will protect your secrets.

1666
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:02,251
Yield,

1667
02:19:03,503 --> 02:19:05,213
and your people will live.

1668
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:11,636
Vengeance has consumed us.

1669
02:19:12,094 --> 02:19:14,722
We cannot let it
consume our people.

1670
02:20:10,736 --> 02:20:12,613

As long as you're
sure the police

won't be waiting

1688
02:21:34,028 --> 02:21:35,655
Don't worry. Took care of that.

1689
02:21:35,821 --> 02:21:37,114
But you might want to slow down

1690
02:21:37,198 --> 02:21:39,450
on your homework-for-hire
business.

1691
02:21:39,533 --> 02:21:41,911

can't help you with that.

1692
02:21:43,204 --> 02:21:45,039

talk to me about something?

1693
02:21:45,206 --> 02:21:46,207
Yes.

1694
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:49,752
Your suit. It's a great design,

1695
02:21:50,294 --> 02:21:51,545
but can't let you leave with it.

1696
02:21:51,712 --> 02:21:52,922
It's all good.

1697
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:54,298
Figured the least I could do

1698
02:21:54,382 --> 02:21:56,050
is help Wakanda
clean up my mess.

1699
02:21:57,301 --> 02:21:58,803
I have one more
thing to show you.

1700
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:00,221
Come.

1701
02:22:04,225 --> 02:22:07,311
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

1702
02:22:07,478 --> 02:22:08,854
but it was worth it.

1703
02:22:09,522 --> 02:22:10,523
How did you...

1704
02:22:11,857 --> 02:22:13,401
It's my dad's car.

1705
02:22:14,652 --> 02:22:16,362

02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:25,830

1710
02:22:25,996 --> 02:22:27,289
Be there before you arrive.

1711
02:22:32,837 --> 02:22:33,838

02:22:49,145 --> 02:22:50,688
Sounds fun,

1717
02:22:50,771 --> 02:22:53,607
but I have something
I need to take care of.

1718
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:20,801
And now I present to you

1719
02:23:20,968 --> 02:23:22,136
Princess Shuri,

1720
02:23:22,303 --> 02:23:23,596
the Black Panther!

1721
02:23:42,072 --> 02:23:44,909
The Black Panther
sends her regards,

1722
02:23:45,701 --> 02:23:47,703
but she will not
be joining us today.

1723
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:50,790
I, M'Baku,

1724
02:23:50,956 --> 02:23:53,501
leader of the Jabari Tribe,

1725
02:23:53,667 --> 02:23:55,127
son of Wakanda,

1726
02:23:56,629 --> 02:23:58,380
wish to challenge

1727
02:23:59,465 --> 02:24:00,633

1728
02:25:32,433 --> 02:25:33,767
What the hell is this?

1729
02:25:33,851 --> 02:25:36,270
Can we turn around?

1730
02:25:36,687 --> 02:25:38,647
I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

1731
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,483
Why don't you go check it out?

1732
02:25:41,567 --> 02:25:42,860
Okay.

1733
02:25:45,654 --> 02:25:46,947
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1734
02:25:47,364 --> 02:25:49,366
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1735
02:25:49,533 --> 02:25:51,243
How do you want us to proceed?

1736
02:25:51,327 --> 02:25:52,786
What the...

1737
02:26:03,422 --> 02:26:04,715
Ah!

1738
02:26:04,798 --> 02:26:07,134

1739
02:26:07,801 --> 02:26:09,845

1740
02:26:09,929 --> 02:26:11,055

this is your aunty, Shuri.

1786
02:31:56,024 --> 02:31:57,025
Hi.

1787
02:32:17,963 --> 02:32:20,632
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

1788
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:23,885
Away from the
pressure of the throne.

1789
02:32:25,262 --> 02:32:26,471
Your father,

1790
02:32:27,097 --> 02:32:28,849
your <i>baba,</i>

1791
02:32:29,016 --> 02:32:31,685
prepared us for
his death, didn't he?

1792
02:32:36,356 --> 02:32:38,400
But he didn't want
us to go to the funeral

1793
02:32:39,234 --> 02:32:42,154
because he felt the
time was not yet right.

1794
02:32:42,863 --> 02:32:45,657
So we had our own
ceremony for him here.

1795
02:32:47,409 --> 02:32:48,994
Did my mother meet him?

1796
02:32:49,077 --> 02:32:50,078
She did.

1797
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:00,797
It's nice to meet you.

1798
02:33:00,881 --> 02:33:02,174
Nice to meet you.

1799
02:33:02,341 --> 02:33:03,884
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1800
02:33:04,384 --> 02:33:06,511
It holds a great history.

1801
02:33:06,678 --> 02:33:09,973
Thanks. Yours is
cool, too, I guess.

1802
02:33:13,268 --> 02:33:15,437
My mom says you are
good at keeping secrets.

1803
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,521
Is that true?

1804
02:33:17,773 --> 02:33:20,567
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1805
02:33:23,570 --> 02:33:25,864
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1806
02:33:30,911 --> 02:33:33,121
My name is Prince T'Challa,

1807
02:33:33,205 --> 02:33:35,123
son of King T'Challa.
