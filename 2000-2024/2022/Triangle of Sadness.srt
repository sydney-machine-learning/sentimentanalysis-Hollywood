1
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,995
<i>Check the audio.</i>

2
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,831
<i>Great.</i>

3
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:51,505
So, what are the most important
aspects of being a male model?

4
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:53,466
I would say: look good.

5
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:56,427
Yes? And?

6
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:58,930
- Er, that's it.
- And walk!

7
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,391
Look good and walk?
But not at the same time, right?

8
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,187
- Most of the times at
the same time.
- Really? Can you do that?

9
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:10,399
- Er, sure.
- Please show us!
Yes, yes, go ahead.

10
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:12,109
Whoo! Yeah!

11
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:20,409
Thank you. Next!

12
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:24,372
Okay...
Hello, hello, hello.

13
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:27,917
What do we have here?

14
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,877
- Hey, there.
- What's up, man?

15
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:33,381
So, I want to know, did
your parents support you
in being a male model?

16
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,341
All the way, right
from the start.

17
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,511
- Even your father?
- Even my father, yeah. Why?

18
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:42,348
He wanted you to enter
this industry where you earn
only 1/3 of the women,

19
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:44,767
where you constantly have
to maneuver homosexual men

20
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,852
who want to sleep with you?

21
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,527
Hot.

22
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:57,780
'I'm Lewis Taylor, and
I'm standing here with
my very best friend...'

23
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,532
- What was your name?
- Er, Carl.

24
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:00,866
My best friend Carl!

25
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,619
- How are you today, Carl?
- Yeah, good, good.

26
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,957
So, is this runway casting for a
grumpy brand or a smiley brand?

27
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,459
Er, I don't know,
man. I don't know.

28
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,129
Well, smiley brands
are the cheap ones,

29
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,590
and the more expensive
the brand gets,

30
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,134
you start to look down
on your consumer.

31
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:21,471
Like, if you want to be a
part of this "von oben"
one-man in-crowd,

32
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,640
you have to show us
some serious cash.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,644
- So it's a grumpy brand, yeah?
- Congratulations! I'm so
happy for you!

34
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:30,647
And if you get the job, you will
get to wear exclusive clothing,

35
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,983
and look down on your consumer.

36
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:35,110
Okay, Carl. Show us some
of that grumpy look.

37
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,779
- No, no...
- Yeah, let's go!

38
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,823
Come on, Carl! You can do it.

39
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:44,119
Yes! "Don't you dare talk to me!

40
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:47,748
"I'm an Aryan 'Ãœbermensch',
too obsessed with the
image of myself

41
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:52,502
"to be involved with anything
that doesn't fit my stylized
image of the world."

42
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:54,171
Wait...

43
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:57,174
"Suddenly, I'm dressed
in something way less expensive.

44
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:58,926
"It's H&M!"

45
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,802
Everybody, come together!

46
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:04,598
"You can too be a part of
this happy, smiling group
of mixed skin colors,

47
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,185
"for not that much money!
#friendship, #everyonesequal,

48
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:11,521
"#happylife,
#stopclimatechange."

49
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:15,525
Oh, no!
Oh! I am so sorry, darling.

50
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:19,529
I didn't see that it was
Balenciaga you're wearing.

51
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:22,532
"We are strong and tough
and unapproachable!"

52
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:24,618
Show me that Balenciaga look!

53
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:29,289
Oh, I'm sorry,
I think it's back to H&M again!

54
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:33,043
"Yeah! We're just kidding.
We're so cheap, we're so happy!"

55
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:35,045
Everybody, come closer together!

56
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:38,131
Balenciaga is back!
Ooh, fiercer than ever!

57
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,883
"We are stone cold.

58
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:42,386
"Yes!
Oh, my God, get away from us!"

59
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,429
H&M is here again!

60
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:45,806
Balenciaga!

61
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:46,974
And H&M!

62
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:48,308
Balenciaga!

63
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,185
And H&M!

64
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:52,564
Oh, everybody,
give it up for these guys!

65
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:55,733
Fabulous! Fabulous, Carl!

66
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,826
Here...

67
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,579
- Hi.
- Hello.

68
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,706
How are you guys doing?

69
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:23,845
- Oh, it's you?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,930
You can hardly tell
it's the same guy.

71
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,432
How old is
this perfume campaign?

72
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:30,393
When was it?
Er, three years ago.

73
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:34,606
- And then maybe a year after that.
- - Okay...

74
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,941
So you do castings again, then?

75
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,485
Yeah.

76
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,738
Could you do
a little walk for us?

77
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:45,700
Er... Just quick.
No smiling. No stopping.

78
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,201
Yeah.

79
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,421
One more time.

80
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,551
Okay.

81
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,848
Okay...

82
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:13,811
Today, fashion is not just about
surface. It's about the inside.

83
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,981
Think about a tune that you like
when you walk.

84
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,650
Look at me.

85
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,536
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, so like a rhythm?

86
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,455
Yeah. Go!

87
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>Maybe he needs Botoxing.</i>

88
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,886
Can you relax your
Triangle of Sadness?

89
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,640
- It's like between
your eyebrows here.
- Okay.

90
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,767
A little bit more...

91
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:55,354
Okay. And open your mouth
so you look a little
bit more available.

92
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,025
Okay, not that much.
A little bit less.

93
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,529
Okay. Thank you very much.

94
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,575
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

95
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,285
Next, please!

96
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,043
- Hi!
- Hi.

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,261
<i>God, no!
They shouldn't be seated there.</i>

98
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,932
<i>Sorry, there's been a mistake.</i>

99
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:18,396
These seats are for someone else.
Please come with me...

100
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,482
- Wait, what...
- What is it?

101
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,943
- But these are our seats.
- Um, no...

102
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,613
- She's on her way over!
- We need those seats now.

103
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,700
Just follow me,
and there are other seats for you.

104
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,411
- But...
- Hurry up, they're here now.

105
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,289
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go. Come on.

106
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,960
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry, but we need your seats now.

107
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,963
- Thank you so much!
- No worries...

108
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,841
- Hello. Welcome!
- Hi! Welcome!

109
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,095
Most welcome... Our apologies.

110
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,181
Hang on... Where's Gunilla?

111
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,601
Excuse me.
We're a party of four.

112
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,104
- We need one more seat.
- Attention please!

113
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,525
Everybody move one seat to the right.

114
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,112
One seat to the right! To the right!

115
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,072
Let's go!

116
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,912
And now everybody moves
one seat to the right.

117
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,707
Great.

118
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,375
Perfect.

119
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,171
- Where can I sit?
- Sorry?

120
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,508
- I don't have a seat now.
- Can you just...?
There's a seat.

121
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,303
Just right up there.
Yeah. Just there.

122
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,228
Yaya! Yaya!

123
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,402
Yaya, look here.
Look here, Yaya!

124
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,073
Yaya!

125
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,534
Yaya!

126
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,929
Thank you, sir.

127
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,654
Thank you, honey.

128
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,990
That's so sweet of you.

129
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,421
Do you like the place?

130
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,923
- A little stuffy?
- A little stuffy.

131
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,640
What?

132
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:43,937
I don't know, you looked like
you were thinking there.

133
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:45,772
No, I'm not. I'm not.

134
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,234
Cool.

135
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:54,448
I can tell there's
something's wrong. Just
talk to me, what is it?

136
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:01,163
No, it's just...

137
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,873
When you say...

138
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,336
When you say,
"Thank you, honey" like that...

139
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,963
You don't really give me
an option but to pay.

140
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,968
It was just an observation.
Just something I've noticed.

141
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,850
- We can split the
bill if you like.
- No, no...

142
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,354
- I can whip out a calculator...
- No, no, okay.

143
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,356
- How many glasses of
wine did you have?
- Oh, sure...

144
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:30,359
- You had, like, three more.
- That's not what I mean.

145
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,945
Yeah, I think it all evens out,
you know.

146
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,697
Hmm...

147
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,285
Don't you remember last night?
You said you were gonna...

148
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:43,373
You said you were gonna pay
for food today.

149
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:49,003
At the end of the meal,
you said, "Thanks.
Tomorrow I'll get it."

150
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,341
Sure, but then you
picked up the bill,

151
00:11:53,341 --> 00:11:55,843
and I thought you wanted to pay,
so I said, "Thank you, honey."

152
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:59,931
- But it was there for
such a long time...
- I didn't see it.

153
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,478
- You didn't see it?
- I, er...

154
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:08,189
No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

155
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:11,651
Or I didn't notice it. We were
just having a nice dinner.

156
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:17,323
You didn't see the bill
when it got put on the table?

157
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,409
No, I didn't, Carl.

158
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,711
So the waiter came in, and
put it in the middle of
the table just there.

159
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,547
- And you didn't
happen to see it?
- Oh, my God!

160
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:36,676
What? I'm asking you
seriously now, because...

161
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,136
Wow...

162
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,889
What's... What's "wow"?

163
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:47,270
What are you doing?

164
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,857
No, no, no. Just don't... Wait.
Can you sit down? Sit down.

165
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:54,402
I'm just trying to figure out
what exactly I did wrong!

166
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:58,948
- Seriously?
- Calm down. Please,
just sit down.

167
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:02,744
- You're fighting over money!
- No! That's not what's...

168
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:04,704
- That's literally
what's happening.

169
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:06,623
- I'm just pointing
out the fact that...

170
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,958
- Why are you so
obsessed with money?
- I'm not obsessed.

171
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,296
Can you just sit down, please?
I'm not obsessed with money.

172
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,799
It was just an
observation from yesterday.
Can you please sit down?

173
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,647
- No, no, no... What
are you doing?
- It's fine.

174
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,735
Well, you can't pay now,
that's ridiculous.

175
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:37,279
- Don't, Carl.
- What are you doing?

176
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,074
- Let go.
- No, no, no... I'm
paying the bill.

177
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,744
That's not why I said it.

178
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:50,000
- Sorry.
- - Are we enjoying ourselves?

179
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,879
Yes, thanks, yeah.
Yaya...

180
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,215
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

181
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,440
Now I feel bad.

182
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,068
Why? I make more money than you.

183
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,916
Excuse me.
Your card didn't work.

184
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,462
- Do you have
another one, maybe?
- Can you try it again, please?

185
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:38,716
I tried it twice.

186
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:43,888
- I'm sorry, we don't accept that one.
- - Just take this one.

187
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,182
Carl! Just give me a second.
Just wait!

188
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:48,268
- Let me pay.
- Just wait!

189
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:55,483
It's fine, you don't have
enough cash. Take that.

190
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:58,570
- You accept that one, yeah?
- Yes.

191
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,364
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

192
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,146
Thank you.

193
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,361
I do think it's quite crazy
how it's such a hard
thing to talk about.

194
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,072
Money.

195
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:29,495
It's such a touchy subject.
Don't you think?

196
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:32,582
Yeah, I think it's un-sexy
to talk about money.

197
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:41,173
Okay, but then why is that?

198
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:43,885
I don't know,
it's just not sexy.

199
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:47,346
Well, you don't think
it's because it's so
tied to gender roles?

200
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,726
Fuckin' hell, the menu
in the restaurant didn't
even have prices for you.

201
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,811
That's not fair, Carl.

202
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:58,024
- I'm always paying.
- No, no, no, let's take
you out of it here.

203
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:00,693
And just talk about
women in general.

204
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:05,323
I'm a generous person, Carl.
Ask any of my friends.

205
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,577
Sure you're generous, but...

206
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:14,373
But?

207
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,253
When it comes to you and
me, we're dealing with
roles that I hate.

208
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:21,672
I don't want to be the man,
whilst you're the woman,

209
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,674
I want us to be best friends.

210
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:26,802
- I don't wanna sleep with
my best friend.
- No, that's not...

211
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:29,889
You don't understand what
I'm trying to say. I mean...

212
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,558
We shouldn't just slip into the
stereotypical gender-based roles

213
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,977
that everyone else
seems to be doing.

214
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:41,484
I want us to be equal.

215
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,415
Excuse me?

216
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:58,377
- You have to fight.
- I'm sorry, what?

217
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,255
If you love her, you
have to fight for her.

218
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,090
I've been there, I know.

219
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,093
If you don't fight,
you're gonna be her slave.

220
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:12,099
The thing is, Yaya, I like
to take you for dinner.
I enjoy paying for you.

221
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,102
But there comes a point
where I do feel used.

222
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,354
I use you?

223
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:20,107
Well, I'm just referring to my
feelings now, but sure, if we...

224
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:22,734
No, no. Just wait. If we go
back the last week or so,

225
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,028
then, yeah, maybe
there is a point...

226
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,738
Are you being serious?

227
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,949
I got you this shirt.
I invited you for dinner.

228
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:32,619
- You're staying at my hotel.
- Well, you got this
shirt for free.

229
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,871
- And actually you didn't
pay for dinner.

230
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:36,874
- That's because my
card didn't work.

231
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:40,127
There's a cash machine
in the lobby. I'll pay you
back every last cent...

232
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,087
It's okay.

233
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,964
Carl, I always intended
to pay you back.

234
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:48,218
I didn't realize you
wanted the money right
now before going to bed.

235
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,848
- So your intention
was to pay me back?
- Yes.

236
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,559
- Really?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,228
So why did you take
the 50-euro bill?

238
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:03,233
Once I realized you didn't have
enough cash, I paid the bill.

239
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:07,029
Instead of giving
me the 50-euro bill, you put
it back in your purse.

240
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:10,908
What? I'm just saying
what happened, Yaya.

241
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,535
What are you...? Don't!

242
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:18,207
What the fuck are you doing?

243
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,751
Don't fucking do that to me!

244
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:24,004
Don't... fucking do
that to me, Yaya!

245
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:26,549
Don't do that to me!

246
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:29,552
- 'Going down.'
- Don't fucking shove
things down me!

247
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,179
- You fucking child!
- Seriously...

248
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:32,388
You're behaving like
a crazy person.

249
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,265
Shut up!
Don't do things like that to me!

250
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,017
What the hell are you doing
with my money?

251
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:39,687
Your money? Oh, my God!
It's not about money, Yaya!

252
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,189
It's not about...

253
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:46,527
It's not about the
fucking money, Yaya!

254
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:48,404
- Oh!
- This is... No, it's not!

255
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:51,199
You're not understanding the
point! It's not about the money!

256
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,910
I'll give you that 50 euros!
I'll give you a 100 euros!

257
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,120
- Oh, yeah?
- No! I'm serious now!

258
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,915
This is not about
the fucking money! Why won't
you understand it?

259
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:01,209
Understand my point!

260
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,045
This is not about the money!

261
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:08,132
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
- I want it to be equal, Yaya!

262
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:12,971
Thought he might
be dangerous, but he
just looked like...

263
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,519
Bullshit feminist.

264
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,368
<i>The person
you're trying to reach...</i>

265
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,690
For fuck's...

266
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:20,391
- What have you been doing?
- Trying to sleep on a chair.

267
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:23,477
- How'd that go?
- Well, I'm back.

268
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:28,023
What have you been doing?

269
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:31,236
I was... walking up and down
the corridor and...

270
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:35,031
- Texting you multiple times.
- Hmm, a lot...

271
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,285
- You saw them?
- Yeah.

272
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:45,667
- This is so silly.
- Yeah.

273
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:51,214
I'm... so good at being...

274
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,508
...manipulative.

275
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:59,347
I don't know, I do it
and I don't even realize
that I'm doing it.

276
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:02,517
- Yeah...
- I love you.

277
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:07,480
No, but seriously, it's amazing
that you can tell me that.

278
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,566
Now you're a generous person.

279
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,652
Okay.

280
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,238
Alright.

281
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,747
Ask me anything.

282
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:25,582
You sure?

283
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:26,958
Uh-huh.

284
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,589
In the restaurant,
with the bill...

285
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:34,549
What about it?

286
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,719
You intentionally
didn't pick that up, right?

287
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,429
- Yes.
- Of course.

288
00:23:42,974 --> 00:23:45,435
Didn't that embarrass you?

289
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:47,854
Nope.

290
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:51,942
- But you make more
money than I do.
- It's not about the money.

291
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:54,027
And you said you
were gonna pay...

292
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:03,620
It doesn't really matter
who makes more money.

293
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,831
What is it about, then?

294
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,668
What if I...

295
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:11,546
...fall pregnant?

296
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:13,047
With me?

297
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:19,136
What if I fall pregnant
and I can't go on working?

298
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:22,682
I need to know that
the person I'm with intends
to take care of me.

299
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:24,809
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

300
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:31,816
Yeah, I guess you're not
the kind to work in...

301
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:34,318
...a restaurant
or a supermarket, are you?

302
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,487
No offense.

303
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:39,615
I'm a model, honey, the only way
for me to get out of this life

304
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:42,743
is to become
someone's trophy wife.

305
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:47,039
So, there's nothing
else to this for you?

306
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:49,750
Other than...

307
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:54,505
...increasing the followers on
our Instagram, and all of that.

308
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,008
- It make sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

309
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,886
I like you. You like me.
It's good for business.

310
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:01,220
Yeah.

311
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:04,098
- Nothing more?
- Uh-hmm.

312
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,017
- Uh-hmm?
- Uh-hmm.

313
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:10,479
I'd like to put a bet on that.

314
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:12,899
Okay.

315
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,735
- Deal.
- Yeah.

316
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:21,365
We'll see.

317
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,660
I'll make you love me.

318
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:28,372
- It'll be real love as well.
- Oh, yeah?

319
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,625
- Yep.
- Okay.

320
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:33,252
You'll forget about
this trophy shit.

321
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:34,879
And you'll love me.

322
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:35,482
'The success of a
luxury cruise mainly
depends on two moments.

323
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:40,112
'Number one: the first hours
the guests are onboard.

324
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:44,157
'And number two: the last day
the guests are onboard.

325
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,828
'And if we can impress them
on those two occasions,

326
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,706
'then the cruise will probably
be a success.'

327
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:53,792
And I don't want to hear
anybody saying,

328
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:58,422
"We don't need to uncover
the sundeck, they all leave
after breakfast."

329
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:02,467
No. I want full set-up
every morning.

330
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,052
No excuses.

331
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,180
Not even for the last hour.

332
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:12,145
It's always,
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

333
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:14,564
If there is an illegal substance
they want, or...

334
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,150
...a unicorn!

335
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,485
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

336
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:21,112
- Yes!
- Whoo!

337
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:23,615
Yes!

338
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:28,036
I know, I know what it is
to work for service.

339
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:30,622
I know all the challenges
you're facing.

340
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:35,501
But at these times, I ask of you
to keep that chin up.

341
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:39,214
Stay strong.

342
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:41,758
And try to remind yourself...

343
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:45,887
...if everything goes well...

344
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:49,474
...at the end of the cruise...

345
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:52,018
- Money, money, money...
- ...you might be getting...

346
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:56,522
- ...a very generous tip!
- Money, money, money...

347
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,030
Money! Money! Money!

348
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,575
Money! Money!
Money! Money! Money!

349
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,460
- Money!
- Yes!

350
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,004
Alicia, who do we have onboard?

351
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:24,842
No...

352
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:31,015
- Housekeeping!
- No. No, thank you.

353
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,853
- Do you want me
to clean the room?
- No, thanks.

354
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:38,106
Okay, I'll come
back in 30 minutes?

355
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:41,109
- No, you can come
back a bit later.
- Okay, one hour?

356
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:43,570
Could you just
come back later, please?

357
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,699
Okay, I'll come back later.
Sorry, ma'am.

358
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,501
Let me change.

359
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:52,806
- Hey there!
- Hey!

360
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,475
- Mario the red, how are you?
- Yes, all good!

361
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:58,103
Great, guys!
Let's greet the rich!

362
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:07,154
Make it shine man,
make it shine!

363
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,406
Make it shine...

364
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:12,159
What?

365
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,535
Nothing.

366
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,168
- Hey!
- Hey.

367
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:29,219
- What are you doing?
- What?

368
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,266
- Are you talking to the crew?
- Yeah...

369
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:38,937
- Why are you
talking to the crew?
- I said hello.

370
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,356
Yeah, you smiled at him
and said hello.

371
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,401
- So?
- Ah...

372
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:58,790
Seriously, Yaya, we're sitting
here together, you shouldn't...

373
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,459
- You just don't do that.
- Do what?

374
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:07,215
If I started smiling
at the hot stewardess and...

375
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,259
- You know...
- You think she's hot?

376
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:15,557
No, but if she was,
and I started smiling at her,

377
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:18,101
and giggling and saying,
"Hey," like you did,

378
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:20,186
then you wouldn't
like it, would you?

379
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,064
- Are you jealous?
- No.

380
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:25,984
- No?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.
It's just like...

381
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,905
I mean, come on, look at you.
And then...

382
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:33,575
And then a hot guy turns up.
I mean, he shouldn't be...

383
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,452
Do you think he's hot?

384
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:37,954
He's alright.

385
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,333
- Do you?
- Yeah!

386
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,420
- What the fuck, man?
- You just said you thought
he was hot!

387
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,549
But come on, you don't
have to... You said it
very quickly. Jesus!

388
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,262
Drop it, okay?

389
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,857
Can I help you, sir?

390
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:48,943
- Sorry, just quickly...
- Yes?

391
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:52,113
I was on the rear deck, and one
of your crew members was...

392
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,823
- ...bare-chested.
- Really?

393
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:55,658
Yeah, and like
smoking and stuff.

394
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:57,785
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's so inappropriate.

395
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:00,621
- Yeah, it did feel
a little bit...
- No, of course.

396
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:02,498
I'll take care of
that. I'm so sorry.

397
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:05,167
- Maybe it's not a big issue...
- No, but it's not
acceptable here.

398
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:08,337
I thought I'd just let you know,
cos... Yeah, I didn't
wanna make anything of it.

399
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:10,506
Well, thank you so much.
It won't happen again, sir.

400
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,550
- I promise you that.
- Alright, thanks.

401
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:15,344
- Alicia?
- Yeah?

402
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:18,472
There's a crew member
up on deck with no shirt on.

403
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:19,849
- No shirt on?
- Yes.

404
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,737
Sorry. Just, er...

405
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:33,030
Yes?

406
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,034
Is it possible to look
at the engagement rings?

407
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:39,745
- Yes. Yes, of course!
- Is that alright?

408
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:43,206
Definitely, yes. Okay.

409
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:46,835
This is a beautiful ring.
This is 24-carat gold.

410
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:49,296
And we have a point nine
diamond in the middle,

411
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:53,091
and we have four brilliants
on every side of the band.

412
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:56,511
- It's a very beautiful ring.
- Yes. It's really nice.

413
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:59,348
Do you want me to try it on
so you can see it on a hand?

414
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,891
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?

415
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,101
- If you don't mind?
- No, of course.

416
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,731
Hmm...

417
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:14,363
Yeah?

418
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:17,449
It's a very nice diamond, this
one. It's a flawless diamond.

419
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,827
What was the price of that one?

420
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:24,039
This one is... 28,000 euros.

421
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,669
Mm-hmm...

422
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:37,928
'Can we get an
almond latte to foredeck?'

423
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,777
Captain?

424
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:59,284
Uh, yes?

425
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:02,912
I just wanted to tell you
it's time for the safety drill.

426
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:04,956
Uh, well, no, I'm...

427
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:07,166
I'm just not feeling well.

428
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:11,963
- Should I get the doctor?
- No, no, I'll be fine.

429
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:15,341
Just have the First take
care of it, and then...

430
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,136
...you know, I'll see you later.

431
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:21,598
Okay!

432
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:23,349
- Okay.
- Okay.

433
00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:30,106
Abigail? Could you get the tray?
Thank you.

434
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:41,326
Honey, Nutella.

435
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:42,702
Hm-mm...

436
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,330
Another one?

437
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:53,087
Have a little look.

438
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:59,510
- Aren't you going to eat the pasta?
- Sorry?

439
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:04,265
Aren't you going
to eat the pasta?

440
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:09,020
Oh, er...
No. I'm gluten intolerant.

441
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,396
Oh?

442
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:13,733
It's just for the pictures.
She's an influencer.

443
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,693
- Oh!
- Okay.

444
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,153
Wow!

445
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,698
You make money from that?

446
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:24,786
- Champagne, sir?
- Nah... White wine.

447
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:28,790
- Sorry, what?
- Yeah... It depends.

448
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,878
It depends. You mostly get
free stuff, to be honest.

449
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:35,839
We got this cruise for free.

450
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:41,804
Good! Her looks paid for
the tickets. Not bad, huh?

451
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:46,892
- Good, huh?
- I guess so, yeah. It did.

452
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:49,436
- A lovely couple, huh?
- Yeah, that's nice.

453
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:52,565
- Not bad, not bad.
- Thank you.

454
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,236
So, what do you do?

455
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:00,573
I sell shit.

456
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:03,909
- What, sorry?
- I sell shit!

457
00:37:06,078 --> 00:37:10,624
- Fertilizer
for agriculture.
- Oh, fertilizer...

458
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:14,587
- Interesting.
- In every business it's
the right place...

459
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:17,715
...in the right moment.
My right place: east Europe.

460
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:21,468
Right moment: end of 80s,
beginning of 90s.

461
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,012
And, er...

462
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:25,848
So, business start, yeah?

463
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:29,310
- In 80s, I was...
- Baby? Can I have this one?

464
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,061
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

465
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:32,771
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

466
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:34,356
- Yeah.
- Love you.

467
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:38,110
Yeah, yeah...
So, in the beginning of 80s,

468
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,071
I was only CEO

469
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:45,409
in one agriculture "Kombinat",
we called it.

470
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:49,622
Hundred thousand pigs,
two million chickens.

471
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:53,584
And we're getting
some kind of monopoly.

472
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:56,503
You can call me the
King of the Shit!

473
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:59,006
- It was...
- I love him. I love him!

474
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:01,091
And when you have money,
you know,

475
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:04,471
you don't leave money to sleep,
you understand?

476
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:07,140
- Money must not
sleep, you know.
- Okay.

477
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,144
So you put this money
from this business,

478
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:15,523
because factories
shutting down...

479
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:20,028
And the
desert is tiramisu.

480
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:23,406
Or panna cotta, you
like both of those.

481
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:29,537
- Oh... you choose.
- A-ha...

482
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,333
You have the panna cotta,
I'll have a tiramisu.

483
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,793
Fine.

484
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,549
Hello!

485
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:46,096
Cheers.

486
00:38:51,393 --> 00:38:56,273
I'm Clementine.
And this is my husband, Winston.

487
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:58,358
We're from Great Britain.

488
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:14,708
My name is Clementine.

489
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:14,666
Nein, nein...

490
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,835
- And this is
my husband, Winston.
- Winston.

491
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:18,712
We're from Great Britain.

492
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:19,337
Nein.

493
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:22,799
Uli, in den Wolken.

494
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:25,760
Hello. This is
my wife, Therese.

495
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,264
She understands you perfectly,
but my wife had a stroke.

496
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:32,726
Since then, she's suffering
from a disability of speaking.

497
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:35,395
In den Wolken.

498
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:37,690
Ja.

499
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,650
Shall I take it away?

500
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:44,405
"In den... In den..."

501
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:46,032
In den Wolken.

502
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,491
In den Wolken!

503
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,911
In den Wol...?

504
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:53,205
- Wolken.
- Wo...

505
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,041
- Champagne, sir?
- No, thank you.

506
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:58,377
- What does it mean?
- "Up in the clouds."

507
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:00,421
Oh! How beautiful.

508
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:10,056
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

509
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:11,557
Take care.

510
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:18,356
Nice to meet you, my friend.
I hope I work with you again.

511
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:20,441
It was a pleasure, Mario.

512
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:24,153
- We're going to miss you.
- Miss you already.

513
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,239
- Take care.
- Take care, you.

514
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:08,072
Look at that.

515
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:12,160
Sad, huh?

516
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:17,791
He's hunting.

517
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,043
- Huh?
- He's hunting!

518
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:23,213
Big dilemma.

519
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:27,676
Should he take risk,
or go to the room, huh?

520
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:32,598
Come on.

521
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,603
Look, look!

522
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:40,480
Maybe has a little chance!

523
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:06,048
Amazing...

524
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:10,719
Wow.

525
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:15,557
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

526
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:18,352
Er... could you
just do me a favor?

527
00:42:19,561 --> 00:42:22,147
I have this girl,
who should be here with me,

528
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:25,067
but couldn't come and...

529
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:28,153
...I would like to take
a picture. Please.

530
00:42:29,238 --> 00:42:32,157
- Can you take my picture?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

531
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,702
I'll stand over here.

532
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,872
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

533
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:50,468
Good?

534
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:53,930
- Thank you very much.
- A pleasure...

535
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,558
- Have a nice evening.
- Yeah, you, too.

536
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:03,690
Excuse me? Mister?

537
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:08,236
Hi! Eh...
Can you please come back?

538
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,865
You can leave your
beer, it's okay.

539
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:15,493
- What?
- You can leave your beer.

540
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,832
- If you come in the middle...
- Yeah?

541
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:22,875
Then we can take a picture
together, the three of us.

542
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,295
Okay, nice! Nice!

543
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:27,046
Yeah!

544
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:29,132
- Now we're talking!
- Yeah!

545
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,637
More boobs, Yaya!
More boobs!

546
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:36,389
Oh...

547
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,269
Thank you very much!
You're very generous!

548
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:45,231
I would like to do something
generous to you.

549
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:47,317
They have Rolex watches
in the reception.

550
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:49,819
We can go down there now, and
I will buy you Rolex watches!

551
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:52,322
- No, it's okay. Thank you.
- No! I would like...

552
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:54,657
It may sound strange, but I'm...

553
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:58,494
What you just did here,
it meant so much to me.

554
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:00,622
So I can...

555
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:02,457
I'm very rich.

556
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:06,002
Yes, let's not beat around
the bush. I'm very rich.

557
00:44:06,002 --> 00:44:07,879
- How rich are you?
- Oh, I'm so...

558
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:11,841
I'm so fucking rich!
I just sold my company.

559
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:16,013
Yeah, I'm not drunk! I
told you, I'm not feeling well.

560
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:19,850
Do you have problem with that?

561
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,186
Can't you respect that?

562
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:24,021
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

563
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:26,649
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

564
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:29,818
Are you
still there, Paula?

565
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:36,825
- Thomas?
- What is it?

566
00:44:36,825 --> 00:44:42,206
I just want to ask you when
you're able to hold the
Captain's Dinner?

567
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh, for fuck's sake...

568
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,253
- I can't do the
Captain's Dinner now!

569
00:44:47,253 --> 00:44:49,046
- No, I'm asking you a question,
Thomas.

570
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:52,883
When are you able to put
on your uniform and be
there for the guests?

571
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:59,056
Oh... Okay.
Well, what's the forecast?

572
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:02,518
The weather's fine, Thomas.
It's about when you can do it.

573
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:05,521
Any day but Thursday.

574
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:08,732
- Thurs... Thursday's good.
- No. Thomas.

575
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:10,484
- Thursday's bad.
- Huh?

576
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:13,404
We have a low-pressure zone
moving in. Any day but Thursday.

577
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:16,949
- Yes, Thursday! Okay!
- Okay, Thomas, listen.

578
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:18,909
I'll come back and talk to you
about this later.

579
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:22,329
Paula! Every day,
they eat dinner.

580
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:27,167
And they're going to eat dinner
Thursday as well. Right?

581
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,005
Your most expensive champagne,
and three glasses.

582
00:45:31,005 --> 00:45:33,132
- Is this your boyfriends?
- Yeah.

583
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:37,303
Guys, you take care
of these girls now!

584
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:42,933
They're really, really nice
girls! Generous. Caring.

585
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:45,144
You treat them right, you know!

586
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:48,355
You think they want
some champagne?

587
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:51,151
Okay, five glasses!
Five glasses.

588
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,036
Ludmilla...

589
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:03,622
- I love you, baby!
- Yeah, yeah...

590
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:09,210
Dance with me!

591
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,714
- I'm terrible at dancing.
- What if I go?

592
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,634
- Come on, dance with me!
- No, no...

593
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:17,719
Come on! Just a little bit.

594
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:21,973
- No, I'm... I'm so...
- Come on. Don't be shy!

595
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:23,808
- No...
- Why? I'm dancing.

596
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:27,479
- No... I never dance.
- Come on, dance with me.

597
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:28,939
- I just don't.
- Why not?

598
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:32,108
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

599
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:35,737
- I feel embarrassed.
- Alright, it's okay.
Whatever...

600
00:47:18,446 --> 00:47:19,781
Carl?

601
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,620
Carl? Are you jealous?

602
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:29,417
Hey! Carl?

603
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:35,673
- Who's Carl?
- What?

604
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:42,805
- You're not Carl?
- No, no. I'm the pool guy.

605
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:44,515
Ooh...

606
00:47:49,812 --> 00:47:53,524
Sorry about coming
into the mansion, I just
needed to get some tools.

607
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:55,234
Oh?

608
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:01,574
Over here...

609
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:07,246
It's very inappropriate.

610
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:12,001
What if my, er...

611
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:15,212
...husband comes home?

612
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:16,923
Where is your husband?

613
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:20,343
He really shouldn't
be leaving such a beautiful
girl on her own.

614
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:23,179
Because it's very dangerous
around here.

615
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:29,060
- He's working.
- Oh...

616
00:48:30,061 --> 00:48:32,313
- Always working...
- Is he?

617
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:34,982
Yeah.
It's hot, huh?

618
00:48:34,982 --> 00:48:37,318
- Yeah, I'm very hot.
- You should take that off.

619
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:40,238
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ooh.

620
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,490
Ooh!

621
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:51,165
The thing is, your husband pays
me a lot of money, you see.

622
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:56,463
So, I do have to just make sure
I'm doing my job properly.

623
00:48:56,463 --> 00:48:58,799
- Okay?
- You check the pipes.

624
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:00,634
Yeah, is there any...

625
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:04,054
...is there any down here
that need to be...

626
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:09,601
...unblocked, or...
is everything okay?

627
00:49:12,938 --> 00:49:15,023
You're sure you're the right guy
for the job?

628
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,985
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

629
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:20,237
Hmm... Let me see.

630
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:53,979
Do you know what
people regret on their deathbed?

631
00:49:53,979 --> 00:49:55,647
Can you turn the phone?

632
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:57,232
- No.
- No?

633
00:49:57,232 --> 00:50:00,527
That they were working too much,
seven out of ten people regret

634
00:50:00,527 --> 00:50:04,823
throwing away their lives
on stupid and pointless jobs.

635
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:07,576
- Can I get you
anything to drink?

636
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:10,287
<i>More champagne, please.</i>

637
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:15,000
I don't know, I was
just born into this life.
It was not my fault.

638
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,713
And when this happened, I...
I just felt like, "Why? Why?"

639
00:50:19,713 --> 00:50:23,175
- Life is so unfair.
- Yeah.

640
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:25,719
We are all equal.

641
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:28,681
- That is so true.
- Everyone's equal.

642
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:40,860
Is there anything you wish for?

643
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:46,658
- Sorry?
- Is there anything
you... wish for?

644
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:51,037
Well... Well, I don't know.

645
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:55,917
That's so sweet of you, madam,
but I'm perfectly fine.

646
00:50:55,917 --> 00:51:01,047
But, but, but, but if today
was your last day alive...

647
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:06,302
- ...hmm... what would
you wish for?
- I have no idea.

648
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,766
- Have you been
for a swim today?
- No, not today.

649
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,979
Why don't you go for a swim
right now?

650
00:51:18,273 --> 00:51:21,317
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:24,904
That's so kind of you,
madam, but unfortunately
we're not allowed

652
00:51:24,904 --> 00:51:27,782
to go for a swim
during working hours, so...

653
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:30,451
I want all the staff
to go for a swim!

654
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:33,580
I want you all to go for a swim!

655
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,835
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

656
00:51:38,835 --> 00:51:42,964
Yeah, well, today might be
a little bit problematic...

657
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:44,257
Problematic?

658
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:46,175
Cos today we have
the Captain's Dinner.

659
00:51:46,175 --> 00:51:50,471
Who cares about the
Captain's Dinner? This will
only take half an hour.

660
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:52,473
Come on, now.

661
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:54,809
You work too hard, come on.

662
00:51:56,227 --> 00:51:59,731
<i>- Yeah, well, let me
see what I can do.
- Merci!</i>

663
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:13,245
No, no, no! Come back!
Come back, please.

664
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:16,832
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

665
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,752
- Sit down.
- Okay.

666
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:24,173
Let's reverse roles.

667
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:27,426
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

668
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:33,599
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

669
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,142
Oh... well...

670
00:52:35,142 --> 00:52:39,104
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

671
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:41,607
- Yeah, but...
- Come, come, I know
you want to.

672
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,859
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

673
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:46,111
But there might be
a problem for me, if I...

674
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:49,031
Now I have to be the authority.

675
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:51,867
- Yeah, well, I have
my clothes on...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

676
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:53,494
Shut up! Now!

677
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:59,250
I command you,
enjoy the moment!

678
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,797
- N-now?
- Please.

679
00:53:09,426 --> 00:53:11,095
- No.
- No?

680
00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:13,138
- No.
- What?

681
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:16,058
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

682
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:17,726
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... No.

683
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:20,229
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

684
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:23,357
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

685
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:25,484
I'm saying...

686
00:53:26,443 --> 00:53:30,072
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

687
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:33,242
Don't worry.
Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

688
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:35,412
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

689
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:38,582
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Quick, quick, quick... Yes!

690
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:44,170
Come on over!
A glass of champagne for...

691
00:53:44,296 --> 00:53:46,172
- This wonderful Miss...
- Alicia.

692
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:49,009
Alicia!
Mademoiselle Alicia!

693
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,678
A glass of champagne!

694
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,936
Darius? I
need your help.

695
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:04,107
I need you tell one of
the guests that the crew
can't go for a swim.

696
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,650
Why?

697
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,694
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

698
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:10,655
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

699
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:13,408
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

700
00:54:13,408 --> 00:54:16,202
He's not responding.
I can't get a hold of him, so...

701
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,413
Could you just please go and
tell them it's not possible?

702
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:21,666
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

703
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,960
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

704
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,922
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

705
00:54:26,922 --> 00:54:30,091
It's not even funny.
Why are you laughing, Erik?

706
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:32,510
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

707
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,263
Well, your break is over.
Go back to work.

708
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,892
It's not even installed yet,
it will take forever, and
I don't have that time.

709
00:54:38,892 --> 00:54:41,978
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

710
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,813
So please go and tell them
it's not possible...

711
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,233
I'm not going to go and talk
to some crazy Russians.

712
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,777
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

713
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:49,986
Same thing.

714
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,155
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

715
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,616
No! We're done.

716
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:58,662
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

717
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,497
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

718
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:04,209
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

719
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:06,461
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

720
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:10,466
Of course. I can get the
First Officer. He's not doing
anything right now.

721
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:13,844
- Could you show the
guest the bridge?
- Yes, of course.

722
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,680
Welcome to the bridge.

723
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,975
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

724
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,030
Thomas?

725
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:38,369
Thomas? Hello?

726
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:47,920
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

727
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,175
- Actually... I have a question.
- Yes, of course.

728
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:56,387
Yesterday, I was
up on the sundeck.

729
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:59,515
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

730
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:01,893
But then I looked at the sails.

731
00:56:01,893 --> 00:56:03,853
- The sails?
- Yes.

732
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:06,522
And they were... a bit dirty.

733
00:56:06,522 --> 00:56:08,900
- Oh!
- Yeah.

734
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,735
- Oh...
- Yeah.

735
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,493
Hello?

736
00:56:20,703 --> 00:56:21,787
Hi.

737
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:29,629
Yeah, but do you
realize the food down
here is going to be bad?

738
00:56:31,172 --> 00:56:32,590
Okay, bye.

739
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:36,385
Okay, guys, listen up.
You are going to swim.

740
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:39,138
So, bring your swimming pants,
and go to the main deck

741
00:56:39,138 --> 00:56:41,600
as quick as possible, okay?

742
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,771
Come on! Chop, chop!
You're going to water slide.

743
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:47,439
Have fun!

744
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:52,152
Friends! Friends!

745
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:55,197
Please come out!
Friends!

746
00:56:55,364 --> 00:56:57,574
Hey, what are you still doing here?

747
00:56:57,699 --> 00:56:59,701
Put on your swimsuits right away.
We're going swimming.

748
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,037
- When?
- Now! Now!

749
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,914
Outside!

750
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:08,377
Put on your swimming trunks.
We are going to the "beach".

751
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:09,836
- What?
- We're going swimming.

752
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,838
Go, go!
Okay, we'll put on our trunks.

753
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:12,923
Okay, friend.

754
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:31,024
Thomas?

755
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:39,157
Thomas?

756
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,830
'Good afternoon.

757
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,583
'I hope that everyone
has had a great day so far,

758
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:51,378
'and that you're looking forward
to the Captain's Dinner tonight.

759
00:57:51,378 --> 00:57:55,757
'We would like to inform
you that we have a slight
change in the schedule.

760
00:57:55,757 --> 00:57:58,886
'The Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30,

761
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:02,180
'and not at 8:00,
as it says on the daily program.

762
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,226
'I repeat: the Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30.

763
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:07,519
'Thank you.'

764
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:09,521
Why the push?

765
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:12,232
Cos the crew's going
for a... a swim.

766
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,987
It's a request from
one of the Russians.

767
00:58:16,738 --> 00:58:21,367
- From the water slide.
- Oh, my God! This I gotta see.

768
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,786
Whoa, whoa!
Do you want to change first?

769
00:58:23,786 --> 00:58:27,540
- Oh, Alessandra! How are you?
- Alicia.

770
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,209
- Al...?
- Can you leave us
for a bit, please?

771
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:32,045
Let's go inside, yeah?

772
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:34,047
I think you need to change
if you wanna go up...

773
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:35,798
Yeah, yeah...

774
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:37,800
- Let's go inside and talk.
- No, no...

775
00:58:38,635 --> 00:58:40,595
Are you okay, man?

776
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:43,640
- Good.
- Yeah?

777
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,810
- Very good.
- We have four and
a half hours left.

778
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,729
Until the Captain's Dinner.

779
00:58:49,729 --> 00:58:53,233
You chill in your room,
have little nap. I'll be
back in a couple of hours.

780
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:55,485
And we'll... go together.

781
00:58:55,485 --> 00:58:57,570
Yeah?

782
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,825
Darius...

783
00:59:02,825 --> 00:59:04,535
Look at you!

784
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:09,582
What are you all worked
up about? I'm fine!
Just totally fine.

785
00:59:09,582 --> 00:59:13,169
- Yeah?
- Completely, a
hundred percent...

786
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:16,422
...fine.

787
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:20,718
- Mohammed! Mohammed!
- What?

788
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:22,679
Come! Let's go! Come, come!

789
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:25,807
- What?
- Let's go!

790
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,435
Oh! Whoo!

791
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:32,689
Wonderful!

792
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,778
- Some champagne.
- Bravo!

793
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,325
SantÃ©!

794
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:50,958
Are we enjoying ourselves? Yes!

795
01:00:29,872 --> 01:00:33,000
If you just stand here,
and they will be coming to you.

796
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,503
- Okay.
- Let me see you. Okay.

797
01:00:38,422 --> 01:00:40,674
- Okay!
- Thank you, Paula.

798
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:43,135
- Just one night, that's all.
- Okay.

799
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,932
Darius, could you stand next
to him? Just to make sure...

800
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:55,856
- Okay? You're ready?
- Thank you.

801
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:57,358
- Yep.
- Yes.

802
01:00:58,692 --> 01:01:01,320
Okay, let's get ready
to open the doors.

803
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,822
Open on my signal, yes?

804
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:07,076
And... go.

805
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:13,207
Good evening.

806
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:15,376
- Welcome to the
Captain's Dinner.
- Thank you.

807
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:18,420
- Would you like a
glass of champagne?
- Thank you very much.

808
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,383
Good evening.
Welcome to the Captain's Dinner.

809
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:23,009
Hi... Hi!

810
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:25,845
Good evening.
Enjoying your cruise?

811
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,391
- Welcome.
- Hello, ma'am.

812
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:31,977
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

813
01:01:33,728 --> 01:01:36,398
Oh, hello, ma'am. How are you?

814
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:38,400
Enjoy your dinner.

815
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,860
Hope the weather's not
too rough on you.

816
01:01:42,195 --> 01:01:44,072
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

817
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:45,574
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

818
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:47,742
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

819
01:01:47,742 --> 01:01:50,370
- Hello, sir.
- Good evening.
Jarmo BjÃ¶rkman...

820
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,747
I have a question. I'm sorry.

821
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:57,335
- Yesterday, I was up on deck.
- Yes.

822
01:01:57,335 --> 01:02:01,006
And it was so beautiful.
Everything was fantastic.

823
01:02:01,006 --> 01:02:03,216
But then, I saw the sails.

824
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:05,760
The sails?

825
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,470
- The sails, yes.
- Oh...

826
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:10,974
Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

827
01:02:12,434 --> 01:02:14,728
Do you think it's possible
to wash them?

828
01:02:14,728 --> 01:02:18,815
Well, I don't think that's
possible, ma'am, because, er...

829
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:22,193
- ...this is a motorized vessel.
- Yeah.

830
01:02:22,193 --> 01:02:24,613
So, we don't have any sails.

831
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:30,201
Maybe it was the sundeck roof?

832
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:35,040
- Well... Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

833
01:02:37,918 --> 01:02:40,420
<i>- Magnus!
- Yes?</i>

834
01:02:41,254 --> 01:02:47,886
The ship in the catalogue
had bright white sails, didn't it?

835
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:49,930
- Yes.
- Right.

836
01:02:50,931 --> 01:02:53,266
Yes. He says yes.

837
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:55,436
- It was sails.
- Magnus says yes.

838
01:02:55,436 --> 01:02:56,646
Yes.

839
01:02:57,647 --> 01:02:59,982
Jesus Christ...

840
01:02:59,982 --> 01:03:02,610
Well, then, in that case,

841
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,946
we will clean the sails.

842
01:03:04,946 --> 01:03:08,074
- Yes.
- Of course.

843
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:11,661
I'm sure we can find
a solution for you. I'm sure...

844
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:13,955
- Can I escort you to a table?
- Okay.

845
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:16,082
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

846
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:19,460
Well... Jarmo BjÃ¶rkman.
I'm sitting at your table.

847
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,671
- Oh! Good, good.
- Hello, Jarmo.

848
01:03:21,671 --> 01:03:23,464
Are you also sitting
at the captain's table?

849
01:03:23,464 --> 01:03:24,590
Yes, I am.

850
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,176
- Is it this one?
- Yes. Go ahead.

851
01:03:27,176 --> 01:03:28,928
Oh, Lord...

852
01:03:41,357 --> 01:03:43,776
It's not so much apps as code.

853
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:48,030
I create code for apps.
So you can program...

854
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:53,786
So, I sell my codes and
my skills to different
tech companies.

855
01:03:55,246 --> 01:04:00,835
And then, the game makers
are pitching ideas to me.

856
01:04:00,835 --> 01:04:02,712
Sir.

857
01:04:06,966 --> 01:04:08,426
So, good evening.

858
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:10,720
For tonight's first meal,
we will be serving you

859
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,890
some delicious oysters
with some black Russian caviar.

860
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:16,767
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

861
01:04:23,316 --> 01:04:26,402
- Are we enjoying the food?
- - Yes, very much.

862
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,331
So, what business
do you have together?

863
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,583
Oh, it's
a family business.

864
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,836
Producing products
in precision engineering.

865
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,006
What do you manufacture?

866
01:04:46,006 --> 01:04:49,176
Well, our products have been
employed in upholding democracy

867
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,470
all over the world.

868
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,936
What product is that?

869
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:02,564
Basically, our best-selling
product is the hand grenade.

870
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:06,235
Sorry, the what?

871
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,528
The hand grenade, dear.

872
01:05:14,326 --> 01:05:17,204
For a long time, it was
the personal exploding device.

873
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:21,875
But then came those
UN regulations, and
messed everything up.

874
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:25,212
A personal exploding device...

875
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,797
Excuse me.

876
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:31,176
...is a very complicated word
for a land mine.

877
01:05:31,176 --> 01:05:33,637
Yeah...

878
01:05:34,888 --> 01:05:39,142
Those regulations trimmed...
25% off on profits.

879
01:05:39,142 --> 01:05:41,979
- Yeah.
- It was hard times
for us, but...

880
01:05:42,771 --> 01:05:46,608
- We pulled together, didn't we?
- Yes, we did, darling.

881
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:49,278
And we still love each other.

882
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,196
- A toast!
- Oh, yeah.

883
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,075
Er... to love!

884
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:57,744
- To love.
- To love.

885
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,549
- Sir.
- Madam.

886
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:18,016
This is our sea urchin,
with an emulsion of sea weed.

887
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:22,020
On top, you've got black
truffle, caviar, chili oil,

888
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,731
and a drizzle of
yuzu vinaigrette.

889
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,608
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

890
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,697
- Hmm!
- Hmm...

891
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,041
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- - Yes.

892
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,043
Madam.

893
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,273
Sir.

894
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,026
Madam.

895
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:14,280
- So are you feeling
a bit seasick?
- Yes, a bit.

896
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,574
Yes, so I think it would be
better to eat something,

897
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,369
because seasickness is worse
on an empty stomach.

898
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,477
Sir.

899
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:55,281
So, now we are serving
some hamburger with french
fries for the captain.

900
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:57,199
And for you, we have
something really special.

901
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:01,537
We have grilled and
smoked octopus along with
some caramelized lemon,

902
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:04,957
and on top, beautiful garden
flowers. Please enjoy.

903
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,669
I'm not a fan of fine dining.

904
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,549
Are you okay?

905
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:23,142
Madam? Dagueneau,
French, Sauvignon blanc?

906
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,184
Champignon...

907
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,644
Du champagne! S'il vous plaÃ®t.

908
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:27,187
Champagne.

909
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:32,985
Quick!

910
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,075
<i>SantÃ©!</i>

911
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:44,663
If you feel seasick, you should
try and eat something, ma'am.

912
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:47,833
Oh, are you okay?

913
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:51,837
Are you
alright, sir?

914
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:55,049
Sir?

915
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,647
I'm good...

916
01:09:11,524 --> 01:09:13,526
Excuse me.

917
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:15,820
- Are you okay?
- I'm afraid not...

918
01:09:17,864 --> 01:09:19,991
How are you?

919
01:09:21,701 --> 01:09:25,038
Oh, my God! Oh!

920
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:26,539
Please.

921
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:28,875
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

922
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:32,170
- Oh, my darling.
- More champagne...

923
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:35,215
Maybe you should
have some water?

924
01:09:35,215 --> 01:09:36,633
Champagne.

925
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:39,219
Champagne? You should not
drink champagne now.

926
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:41,096
Take some water, please.

927
01:09:43,723 --> 01:09:46,768
Okay. It's helping.
She's fine. Yeah...

928
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:54,734
Okay, the restroom.
Let's go, I've got you.

929
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:57,737
- More wine, sir?
- - Ludmilla, don't leave me!

930
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:11,835
You okay?

931
01:10:19,593 --> 01:10:21,094
Darius?

932
01:10:21,678 --> 01:10:26,433
- He doesn't look well.
- You okay?
Feeling seasick, sir?

933
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:29,311
Is it your chest?
Here, chest pains.

934
01:10:29,311 --> 01:10:31,688
- Grilled octopus...
- Ginger candy?

935
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:35,692
Oh, ma'am.
Thank you for tonight.

936
01:10:37,277 --> 01:10:41,824
Everybody, let's try to
keep calm. Take your seats.

937
01:10:41,824 --> 01:10:45,036
Er... the next course is going
to be wonderful.

938
01:10:45,036 --> 01:10:47,788
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

939
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:49,957
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

940
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,835
Stay calm, everybody,
everything is fine.

941
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,297
Damn!

942
01:10:56,923 --> 01:11:00,927
Excuse us. Excuse me.
Make way, please.

943
01:11:00,927 --> 01:11:02,929
Are you okay?

944
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:05,348
Keep moving, everything is fine.
Everything is fine.

945
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:06,933
I'm gonna open your shirt.

946
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,726
- Is it a stroke?
- I don't know.

947
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:10,144
Everybody, stay calm!

948
01:11:10,186 --> 01:11:11,395
In den Wolken.

949
01:11:11,979 --> 01:11:14,982
Erik! Erik!
The defibrillator right now!

950
01:11:15,107 --> 01:11:16,442
In den Wolken!

951
01:11:17,902 --> 01:11:21,280
Careful! Careful!
Thank you for tonight.

952
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,658
Thank you for tonight.
Thank you.

953
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:27,119
- Just clean up now.
- Take some deep
breaths for me, sir.

954
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:31,249
<i>Start by removing all clothing
from the patient's chest...</i>

955
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:45,012
Oh, oh!

956
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:49,517
- That's okay, madam.
- Hey... There, there.

957
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:52,144
I'm glad the hat came in useful.

958
01:11:52,144 --> 01:11:55,565
- So sorry, darling...
- No, no. It's nothing at all.

959
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:05,783
Ha!
Okay, here we are.

960
01:12:07,034 --> 01:12:08,494
Thank you.

961
01:12:10,496 --> 01:12:14,918
I have a joke. Do you know
how to tell a communist?

962
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:19,214
It's someone
who reads Marx and Lenin.

963
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:23,176
And do you know how to tell
an anti-communist?

964
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:24,720
Uh-huh.

965
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,516
It's someone who understands
Marx and Lenin. Ha-ha!

966
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:32,561
It's Ronald Reagan.
Funny guy!

967
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:37,232
"Never argue with an idiot,
they'll only bring you
down to their level

968
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:40,277
"and beat you with experience."
Mark Twain.

969
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:42,738
Oh-oh... Okay.

970
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,282
Ronald Reagan, he said also,

971
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:50,120
"Socialism works only in heaven
where they don't need it,

972
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,207
"and in hell
where they already have it."

973
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:57,461
- That's...
that's pretty good.
- Yeah?

974
01:12:57,461 --> 01:12:59,838
Okay. Hold on...
I've got one here.

975
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,549
Oh, oh, oh, no, I have one!

976
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:07,679
"Growth for the sake of
growth is the ideology
of a cancer cell."

977
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,806
- Ah...
- That's Edward Abbey.

978
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:14,519
Listen: "The problem with
socialism is that you eventually

979
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:17,606
"run out of other
people's money."

980
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:20,817
- Margaret Thatcher.
- You're going to
like this one...

981
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:25,906
"The last capitalist we
hang will be the one
who sold us the rope."

982
01:13:25,906 --> 01:13:29,451
- Karl Marx.
- Oh! Shit!

983
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:33,247
Okay! Okay, okay, okay...

984
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:41,213
- Sorry.
- Dear God!

985
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:46,593
Okay. A classic.

986
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:50,139
"The most powerful single force
in the world today

987
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:54,978
"is man's eternal desire
to be free and independent."

988
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:57,272
- Kennedy.
- Okay.

989
01:13:57,272 --> 01:14:00,775
"Freedom in capitalist society
always remains about the same

990
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:02,735
"as it was in ancient Greece.

991
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:05,655
"Freedom... for slave owners."

992
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:07,865
I know. Vladimir Lenin!

993
01:14:09,993 --> 01:14:11,494
- School.
- Ah...

994
01:14:14,747 --> 01:14:18,501
A Russian capitalist,
and an American communist.

995
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:22,171
On a $250-million luxury yacht.

996
01:14:44,277 --> 01:14:45,778
Very good!

997
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:48,364
Drink, my friend!

998
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:51,200
Drink, you're
supposed to drain it.

999
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,286
- Come on.
- Okay.

1000
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:54,704
Drink!

1001
01:14:55,622 --> 01:14:59,709
- Dimitry, stay focused!
Stay focused.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1002
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:01,628
- Drink!
- Okay.

1003
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:06,299
- Red or black?
- Black.

1004
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:07,675
Very good.

1005
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:11,554
- Red or black?
- Er... black.

1006
01:15:12,222 --> 01:15:13,973
Have a drink.

1007
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,648
Okay...

1008
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:24,235
- Red or black?
- Black.

1009
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:26,403
Very good!

1010
01:15:26,403 --> 01:15:28,572
- Red.
- Take a drink!

1011
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,533
Wow...

1012
01:15:36,747 --> 01:15:37,998
Red or black?

1013
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:41,168
Er...

1014
01:15:46,173 --> 01:15:48,509

again. Bobby Kennedy was killed.

the Kennedy brothers,

01:29:42,268 --> 01:29:44,103
No one else?

1181
01:29:44,103 --> 01:29:45,855
You think I'm a pirate?

1182
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:47,565
Are you okay?

1183
01:29:47,565 --> 01:29:50,902
Just because I'm black,
you think that I'm
a pirate. That's it!

1184
01:29:50,902 --> 01:29:53,029
- Ah! Okay, okay.
- Don't go there...

1185
01:29:53,029 --> 01:29:55,531
- Don't say that I'm...
- Don't go there.

1186
01:29:55,531 --> 01:29:57,700
You can
cry on my shoulder!

1187
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:01,663
He comes to me with his big
watch and says I'm a pirate
just because I'm black!

1188
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:03,122
What's the problem
with you, man?

1189
01:30:03,122 --> 01:30:05,291
He hasn't said anything
about you being black.

1190
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:10,129
- You're calling him a racist.
- In the eyes, I can
see it in his eyes...

1191
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:12,590
- Who are you?
Who are you?
- Sir!

1192
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:15,885
- I work in the engine room, man!
- - Sir!

1193
01:30:15,885 --> 01:30:18,012
- What?
- Excuse me.

1194
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:20,306
I think you should
just calm down now.

1195
01:30:20,306 --> 01:30:22,934
It's not a good time
to step up the situation.

1196
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:24,143
- Just stay calm and
stay positive.

1197
01:30:24,143 --> 01:30:26,187
He works in
the engine room?

1198
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:29,649
There's a lot of people on the boat.
We can't see each other all the time.

1199
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:33,778
- So what's the problem?
- Please don't go there.

1200
01:30:33,778 --> 01:30:35,697
I'm sorry. I just
have to get that.

1201
01:30:37,115 --> 01:30:39,993
- Just say what you have to say.
- - Stop.

1202
01:30:39,993 --> 01:30:41,744
Say it to me.

1203
01:30:41,744 --> 01:30:44,122
Yes, I know.
I'll get back to you. I know.

1204
01:30:44,122 --> 01:30:46,749
Sir. Sir!

1205
01:31:31,462 --> 01:31:33,881
Oh! Ah!

1206
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:35,049
Easy, easy!

1207
01:31:49,813 --> 01:31:51,232
Oh...

1208
01:31:51,232 --> 01:31:54,235
- Ow! Ow!
- Shh, shh!

1209
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:58,697
Be quiet.

1210
01:32:03,327 --> 01:32:05,996
Nein... nein...

1211
01:32:06,413 --> 01:32:07,581
In den Wolken!

1212
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:15,422
No, don't
use the flares!

1213
01:32:15,422 --> 01:32:18,384
It's our last flare!
Don't use the flare!

1214
01:32:27,686 --> 01:32:32,857
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name...

1215
01:32:46,788 --> 01:32:48,707
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1216
01:32:53,044 --> 01:32:56,047
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1217
01:32:59,509 --> 01:33:01,386
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1218
01:33:08,226 --> 01:33:11,062
<i>Nein, nein. In den Wolken!</i>

1219
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:16,484
<i>IN DEN WOLKEN!</i>

1220
01:33:41,301 --> 01:33:44,137
My, oh my, oh my!

1221
01:33:44,137 --> 01:33:47,015
- Hey!
- What?

1222
01:33:47,015 --> 01:33:48,558
Look!

1223
01:33:48,558 --> 01:33:50,227
Oh, shit...

1224
01:33:51,519 --> 01:33:53,688
Yaya, wake up, wake up.

1225
01:33:57,525 --> 01:33:58,945
Look!

1226
01:34:11,332 --> 01:34:13,542
There's water in there.

1227
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:15,920
- There's water in there.
- Yes!

1228
01:34:16,921 --> 01:34:19,173
- Is it closed?
- It's closed. It's closed.

1229
01:34:19,173 --> 01:34:22,551
- Paula, we need water!
- Be patient.

1230
01:34:22,551 --> 01:34:26,180
- Is somebody in there?
- Yeah, there's
someone in there.

1231
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:28,349
Calm down, calm down.

1232
01:34:28,349 --> 01:34:30,434
- Does she have water?
- Yes.

1233
01:34:30,434 --> 01:34:34,730
Open up! Open up!

1234
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:39,151
Open up!
Open up! Open up!

1235
01:34:40,236 --> 01:34:43,948
- It's Abigail.
Abigail! Come out!
- Ma'am Paula?

1236
01:34:43,948 --> 01:34:46,284
- Are you okay?
- What?

1237
01:34:46,284 --> 01:34:48,202
- Open the hatch!
- Water! Water!

1238
01:34:48,202 --> 01:34:50,580
- Okay!
- - Paula, we need water...

1239
01:34:52,999 --> 01:34:56,043
- Hey, ma'am Paula!
- What do you have?

1240
01:34:56,502 --> 01:34:59,422
We need all of these boxes out.
Okay?

1241
01:34:59,422 --> 01:35:02,383
So, everybody, just calm down.
We'll get water now.

1242
01:35:02,383 --> 01:35:04,260
Yes!

1243
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,596
There's some chips in there as well.
So, everybody will get some.

1244
01:35:06,596 --> 01:35:08,598
- And chips?
- And chips.

1245
01:35:15,354 --> 01:35:17,982
What's she doing?

1246
01:35:17,982 --> 01:35:20,902
What are you doing?
What's taking so long? Come on.

1247
01:35:23,738 --> 01:35:26,949
Just wait a minute. Just
back up. Back up a bit.

1248
01:35:27,825 --> 01:35:30,578
And the chips, Abigail.
Come on, everything out.

1249
01:35:30,578 --> 01:35:33,248
Paula,
ask for food, yeah?

1250
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:38,921
- And the Evian.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1251
01:35:41,256 --> 01:35:43,550
Thank you.
And how many are you?

1252
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,137
You're five? Just be patient.
Everyone will get...

1253
01:35:48,013 --> 01:35:49,473
Here you go.

1254
01:35:51,058 --> 01:35:52,517
There you go.

1255
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,187
Please save it.

1256
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:08,116
- Are there more boxes with water?
- - No, this is it.

1257
01:36:08,116 --> 01:36:10,327
- What's this?
- It's a facial spray.

1258
01:36:10,327 --> 01:36:13,080
But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1259
01:36:14,122 --> 01:36:17,376
Keep it close to your mouth,
so you won't waste it.

1260
01:36:21,838 --> 01:36:23,340
Here you go.

1261
01:36:24,007 --> 01:36:26,093
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1262
01:36:34,935 --> 01:36:37,813
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1263
01:36:48,615 --> 01:36:50,117
Okay?

1264
01:37:27,155 --> 01:37:30,283
Bravo!

1265
01:37:30,283 --> 01:37:33,328
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

1266
01:37:34,913 --> 01:37:36,331
Crazy.

1267
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,506
- Did she catch that with her hands?
- - Good job, Abigail!

1268
01:37:46,925 --> 01:37:50,929
Good job! What is
that? An octopus?

1269
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:53,181
- Octopus.
- Good!

1270
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:56,309
- What do you think
we should do now?
- Fucking impressive.

1271
01:37:56,309 --> 01:37:58,853
We need
to make a fire.

1272
01:37:58,853 --> 01:38:01,314
Of course we need to
make a fire.

1273
01:38:01,314 --> 01:38:02,649
Yes...

1274
01:38:04,317 --> 01:38:07,278
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1275
01:38:07,278 --> 01:38:08,529
What?

1276
01:38:08,529 --> 01:38:12,450
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1277
01:38:15,495 --> 01:38:16,996
- No?
- No!

1278
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:19,624
- What?
- No!

1279
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:24,337
Then you'll make the fire
after you're done fishing,
and then we should...

1280
01:38:24,337 --> 01:38:27,632
- We need to clean the octopus.
- Of course we do.

1281
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:35,306
Do any of you know
how to clean an octopus?

1282
01:38:35,306 --> 01:38:39,603
- Huh?
- To clean an octopus!

1283
01:38:39,603 --> 01:38:41,647
Do you know how to do it?

1284
01:38:50,197 --> 01:38:52,408
Uh-huh...

1285
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:04,378
One for you.

1286
01:39:05,296 --> 01:39:07,172
One for me.

1287
01:39:07,172 --> 01:39:08,674
One for you.

1288
01:39:09,383 --> 01:39:11,343
One for me.

1289
01:39:11,343 --> 01:39:13,178
One for you.

1290
01:39:13,178 --> 01:39:15,014
One for me.

1291
01:39:15,014 --> 01:39:16,849
One for you.

1292
01:39:16,849 --> 01:39:18,392
One for me.

1293
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:20,311
One for you.

1294
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,855
One for me.

1295
01:39:22,855 --> 01:39:26,233
One for you. One for me.

1296
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:28,652
One for you.

1297
01:39:28,652 --> 01:39:30,237
For me.

1298
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:32,323
For you. For me.

1299
01:39:32,323 --> 01:39:34,909
For you.
For me.

1300
01:39:36,368 --> 01:39:38,662
- Uh-huh!
- What?

1301
01:39:41,081 --> 01:39:42,791
What's that?

1302
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:46,670
That's mine.

1303
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:48,756
No, the big pile there?
What's that?

1304
01:39:48,756 --> 01:39:51,216
Mine. It's mine.

1305
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:54,261
- All of this?
- Yes.

1306
01:39:55,179 --> 01:39:59,183
No. No, no, no...
Why do you get so much food?

1307
01:40:00,893 --> 01:40:02,144
Why?

1308
01:40:06,065 --> 01:40:07,983
I caught the fish.

1309
01:40:08,692 --> 01:40:10,903
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1310
01:40:10,903 --> 01:40:12,739
- And?
- I cooked.

1311
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:16,993
I did all the work.
And everybody got something.

1312
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:21,289
Hmm...

1313
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:25,377
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1314
01:40:25,377 --> 01:40:27,545
What did you do?

1315
01:40:28,463 --> 01:40:32,092
We... gathered all the wood
for the fire.

1316
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:34,761
I moved the log.

1317
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:38,390
Yeah, this big log was
over there, and we
moved it over here.

1318
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:40,058
Not enough.

1319
01:40:41,226 --> 01:40:44,437
No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1320
01:40:44,437 --> 01:40:48,650
- They don't know
how to do that.
- Exactly.

1321
01:40:50,443 --> 01:40:54,531
And maybe that's why you
should not be so lazy
and dependent on me.

1322
01:40:54,531 --> 01:40:57,325
Uh-huh!

1323
01:41:16,261 --> 01:41:19,889
Abigail...
I think you're forgetting

1324
01:41:19,889 --> 01:41:23,643
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1325
01:41:23,643 --> 01:41:25,562
Remember?

1326
01:41:25,562 --> 01:41:29,149
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1327
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:31,151
You have to do what I say.

1328
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:35,906
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1329
01:41:35,906 --> 01:41:38,783
- You don't know
how to handle...
- What yacht?

1330
01:41:38,783 --> 01:41:40,911
Where's the yacht?

1331
01:41:40,911 --> 01:41:43,997
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1332
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:47,627
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1333
01:41:47,627 --> 01:41:50,087
I can make your
life easy and nice.

1334
01:41:50,087 --> 01:41:52,673
- When we get back?
- Yeah.

1335
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:55,009
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1336
01:41:55,009 --> 01:41:58,137
What, you think that
we'll stay here forever? What?

1337
01:41:58,137 --> 01:42:00,848
You're funny.

1338
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:04,310
This is not how you were
trained, Abigail. Please give...

1339
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:06,437
Whoa!

1340
01:42:08,648 --> 01:42:11,192
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

1341
01:42:12,777 --> 01:42:16,030
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1342
01:42:17,281 --> 01:42:18,741
Hey!

1343
01:42:23,955 --> 01:42:25,581
Who am I?

1344
01:42:26,999 --> 01:42:29,502
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1345
01:42:29,502 --> 01:42:33,714
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1346
01:42:33,714 --> 01:42:38,427
On the yacht, toilet manager.
Here... captain. Who am I?

1347
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:44,642
You're the captain.

1348
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:47,562
Yes.

1349
01:42:50,523 --> 01:42:53,234
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1350
01:42:53,234 --> 01:42:56,362
- Very
good. Cutie pie?
- Captain.

1351
01:42:57,154 --> 01:42:59,657
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1352
01:42:59,657 --> 01:43:01,576
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1353
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:04,579
Who am I?

1354
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,875
Who am I?

1355
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:13,629
Who am I?

1356
01:43:22,973 --> 01:43:26,059
In the yacht, cleaning lady.
Here, captain.

1357
01:43:26,935 --> 01:43:28,437
Okay?

1358
01:43:42,618 --> 01:43:44,703
Have one more.

1359
01:43:44,703 --> 01:43:46,204
Thank you.

1360
01:43:47,289 --> 01:43:49,374
I would say, I agree.

1361
01:43:49,374 --> 01:43:53,295
I mean, er...
we have to work together.

1362
01:43:54,296 --> 01:43:57,799
And... create a good group.

1363
01:43:57,799 --> 01:43:59,426
Good society.

1364
01:43:59,426 --> 01:44:02,054
Do you know the saying,

1365
01:44:02,054 --> 01:44:05,432
"From each according
to his ability,

1366
01:44:05,432 --> 01:44:08,393
"to each according
to his needs"?

1367
01:44:11,313 --> 01:44:13,523
You don't know this?

1368
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:16,318
Ma'am Paula...

1369
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:24,701
With respect to your expertise
in this situation...

1370
01:44:26,328 --> 01:44:30,123
...I would like to make a
suggestion, if that's okay?

1371
01:44:31,416 --> 01:44:32,960
Sure.

1372
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:38,507
My suggestion is that
the boys...

1373
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,721
stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1374
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:50,352
While you, ma'am Paula, and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1375
01:45:17,547 --> 01:45:18,965
Thank you.

1376
01:45:25,888 --> 01:45:28,266
Hey,
Abigail, look this...

1377
01:45:29,225 --> 01:45:31,561
I would give you
my Patek Philippe.

1378
01:45:31,561 --> 01:45:34,063
For one night in
the boat. Hey, Abigail...

1379
01:45:34,063 --> 01:45:36,649
150 thousand euros!

1380
01:45:37,734 --> 01:45:41,696
- Let us in.
- For you...
original Rolex.

1381
01:45:48,578 --> 01:45:52,206
Nelson... she left the bag.

1382
01:45:53,082 --> 01:45:55,418
- What?
- She left the bag.

1383
01:45:58,588 --> 01:46:00,924
What's in it?

1384
01:46:11,517 --> 01:46:13,770
Pretzel sticks.

1385
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:22,612
- No, we can't have it.
- I'm just gonna have
a look. Alright?

1386
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:31,622
- Nice!
- We can't. No.

1387
01:46:39,588 --> 01:46:41,340
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1388
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:42,841
Wait, wait, wait...

1389
01:46:49,556 --> 01:46:51,016
Maybe...

1390
01:46:53,978 --> 01:46:56,814
...if we just make a
little hole here...

1391
01:46:57,606 --> 01:47:02,987
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1392
01:47:02,987 --> 01:47:04,989
Okay, let me try.

1393
01:47:08,659 --> 01:47:10,995
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1394
01:47:23,591 --> 01:47:25,718
That was perfect!

1395
01:47:28,095 --> 01:47:31,265
- I don't wanna eat it!
I wanna save it!
- So good!

1396
01:47:33,267 --> 01:47:35,060
Put it back.

1397
01:47:52,202 --> 01:47:53,537
Hmm...

1398
01:47:59,878 --> 01:48:02,213
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1399
01:48:02,213 --> 01:48:03,423
Yeah!

1400
01:48:15,226 --> 01:48:16,811
Vera!

1401
01:49:21,459 --> 01:49:23,837
So, what happened here?

1402
01:49:23,837 --> 01:49:26,631
Er... we made a mistake with...

1403
01:49:28,216 --> 01:49:30,218
Why?

1404
01:49:30,218 --> 01:49:32,388
We just fell asleep.

1405
01:49:32,388 --> 01:49:36,767
Now I won't have enough
time to go fish, because I
have to make another fire.

1406
01:49:38,102 --> 01:49:41,105
It takes a lot of work
to make a fire, you know.

1407
01:49:41,105 --> 01:49:42,940
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1408
01:49:59,373 --> 01:50:01,125
Okay.

1409
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,255
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's get this day started.

1410
01:50:06,255 --> 01:50:08,466
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1411
01:50:10,217 --> 01:50:11,969
- Okay.
- Cool.

1412
01:50:11,969 --> 01:50:15,056
Wait, wait, wait.
There's one more thing.

1413
01:50:16,682 --> 01:50:21,020
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1414
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:24,357
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1415
01:50:24,357 --> 01:50:27,902
...we think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1416
01:50:29,028 --> 01:50:31,530
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1417
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:33,074
No.

1418
01:50:35,326 --> 01:50:37,536
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1419
01:50:37,536 --> 01:50:41,040
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1420
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,251
I'm just making sure, because...

1421
01:50:49,632 --> 01:50:51,008
What's this?

1422
01:50:53,052 --> 01:50:54,887
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1423
01:50:54,887 --> 01:50:56,347
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1424
01:50:56,347 --> 01:50:59,225
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1425
01:50:59,225 --> 01:51:01,143
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1426
01:51:04,356 --> 01:51:07,943
- I think they need
to be punished.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1427
01:51:10,862 --> 01:51:13,240
This is really bad.

1428
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,617
This is really, really bad.

1429
01:51:16,702 --> 01:51:18,620
Oh, come on...

1430
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:20,789
I mean, you didn't
watch the fire.

1431
01:51:20,789 --> 01:51:23,292
And then you steal
a pack of pretzel sticks?

1432
01:51:23,292 --> 01:51:26,211
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1433
01:51:26,211 --> 01:51:29,298
And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1434
01:51:31,091 --> 01:51:33,302
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1435
01:51:33,302 --> 01:51:35,762
I need to say something
now, because this is
becoming ridiculous.

1436
01:51:35,762 --> 01:51:40,142
- No, let me say something, Abigail.
- - Did you see that?

1437
01:51:40,142 --> 01:51:41,977
What?

1438
01:51:41,977 --> 01:51:45,147
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1439
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:50,027
- Okay, alright, Just let me say, though...
- - Put your hands down!

1440
01:51:50,652 --> 01:51:52,237
What?

1441
01:51:52,237 --> 01:51:55,115
Your body language
is so aggressive, Carl!

1442
01:51:55,115 --> 01:51:58,285
- What?
- - I'm not getting any food for you.

1443
01:51:58,285 --> 01:52:01,914
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1444
01:52:01,914 --> 01:52:05,292
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1445
01:52:05,292 --> 01:52:08,712
You seriously don't get it.
Put your hands down!

1446
01:52:08,712 --> 01:52:12,424
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1447
01:52:12,424 --> 01:52:16,428
You are inflicting pain on her
by defending yourself.

1448
01:52:34,279 --> 01:52:36,991
Shut the fuck up! No...

1449
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,912
No!

1450
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:10,858
Hey! Ha-ha!

1451
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:15,071
Oh... hey.

1452
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,950
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1453
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:21,119
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1454
01:53:22,036 --> 01:53:24,622
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1455
01:53:26,374 --> 01:53:29,961
- Where did you get it?
- There, at the
back of the rock.

1456
01:53:31,212 --> 01:53:34,048
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1457
01:53:37,719 --> 01:53:39,220
You need help?

1458
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:42,557
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.

1459
01:54:04,913 --> 01:54:06,789
Oh, thank you!

1460
01:55:26,495 --> 01:55:28,414
What?

1461
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,345
- Yaya? Wait, wait!
- Dickhead! Piss off!

1462
01:56:05,201 --> 01:56:08,538
Okay, I'm going
to the lifeboat now.

1463
01:56:08,538 --> 01:56:11,708
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here
and watch the fire?

1464
01:56:11,708 --> 01:56:13,168
Sure.

1465
01:56:16,046 --> 01:56:20,884
And since Carl didn't eat
anything today, he can sleep
with me in the lifeboat.

1466
01:56:22,886 --> 01:56:24,429
Okay. Yeah.

1467
01:56:29,684 --> 01:56:33,897
- Can I come?
- - Abigail, can we both come or...?

1468
01:56:33,897 --> 01:56:36,274
No, just you.

1469
01:56:39,402 --> 01:56:43,198
- Fine, I'll take the pretzels!
- - Eh?

1470
01:56:47,702 --> 01:56:49,621
You're making this
into an issue.

1471
01:56:49,621 --> 01:56:51,915
Are you going to take them?
Yes, take them. Good.

1472
01:56:51,915 --> 01:56:55,252
Why are you making
this into an issue?

1473
01:56:55,252 --> 01:56:57,420
I'm coming! One second!

1474
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:07,222
- What are you gonna
do on the boat?
- I don't know.

1475
01:57:08,932 --> 01:57:10,684
Don't act naive, seriously!

1476
01:57:10,684 --> 01:57:12,936
I don't know why she
asked me, but I'm gonna
do it, of course...

1477
01:57:12,936 --> 01:57:14,479
- Really?
- Yes.

1478
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:17,024
What do you think
she wants with you?

1479
01:57:17,024 --> 01:57:19,735
You're a young, hot guy.
What do you think she's
going to do with you?

1480
01:57:21,362 --> 01:57:23,739
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1481
01:57:23,739 --> 01:57:26,742
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1482
01:57:26,742 --> 01:57:29,328
Take a few, and I'll take them
back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1483
01:57:29,328 --> 01:57:31,163
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1484
01:57:31,163 --> 01:57:35,751
You need to tell me what
to do! You need to tell
me how to navigate this.

1485
01:57:41,465 --> 01:57:42,883
Yaya?

1486
01:57:46,554 --> 01:57:49,223
You just have to stroke her ego.

1487
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:55,771
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1488
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:58,232
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1489
01:57:59,317 --> 01:58:00,735
Okay.

1490
01:58:00,735 --> 01:58:03,654
- Make sure to
set up boundaries.
- Yeah.

1491
01:58:03,654 --> 01:58:07,658
- And nothing sexual, okay?
- No, I won't do
anything sexual.

1492
01:58:08,242 --> 01:58:09,619
Mm-hmm...

1493
01:58:09,619 --> 01:58:11,454
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1494
01:58:11,454 --> 01:58:13,664
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1495
01:58:13,664 --> 01:58:16,709
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1496
01:58:20,963 --> 01:58:23,090
Yaya, I think she's probably
expecting something.

1497
01:58:24,842 --> 01:58:28,012
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1498
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:31,057
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1499
01:58:31,057 --> 01:58:34,018
- I don't know. She
might want something.
- Definitely not a massage!

1500
01:58:34,018 --> 01:58:36,520
She just gave me a whole fucking
packet of pretzels for you...

1501
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:39,023
I don't know what to say...
I can't do anything?

1502
01:58:39,023 --> 01:58:40,775
- No!
- Okay, but...

1503
01:58:40,775 --> 01:58:43,653
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1504
01:58:43,653 --> 01:58:46,113
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1505
01:58:48,449 --> 01:58:50,202
Okay.

1506
01:58:52,371 --> 01:58:54,873
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1507
01:58:54,873 --> 01:58:57,292
I understand! Fuck...

1508
01:58:58,043 --> 01:59:00,671
Yeah... Coming!

1509
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,566
- See you in a bit.
- Morning.

1510
01:59:21,567 --> 01:59:23,944
- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1511
01:59:25,445 --> 01:59:28,323
Yaya!
Yaya, wait. Wait.

1512
01:59:35,414 --> 01:59:38,292
Hey, you!

1513
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:13,660
- See you later.
- Okay.

1514
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:17,205
Pirate! Pirate! He's
coming! He got caught!

1515
02:00:22,169 --> 02:00:23,963
Disgusting.

1516
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:25,965
What?

1517
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,687
What the fuck?

1518
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:42,774
Oh, fucking hell...

1519
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:03,503
- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

1520
02:01:14,722 --> 02:01:18,184
Have you ever used your...
when you were young?

1521
02:01:19,602 --> 02:01:20,603
In den Wolken.

1522
02:01:20,979 --> 02:01:23,314
Oh, you slept with somebody
to get a job?

1523
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:24,691
Nein, nein, nein!

1524
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:36,494
No, you didn't?

1525
02:01:36,494 --> 02:01:39,205
Really? Once?

1526
02:01:39,205 --> 02:01:41,249
Once doesn't count.

1527
02:01:44,544 --> 02:01:47,338
Therese... Wow!

1528
02:01:52,343 --> 02:01:54,554
Where is it?

1529
02:01:54,554 --> 02:01:57,808
- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

1530
02:02:01,061 --> 02:02:04,023
You're acting like children.
Give me the whistle!

1531
02:02:04,023 --> 02:02:06,066
Give me the whistle now!

1532
02:02:08,694 --> 02:02:10,404
So childish!

1533
02:02:40,267 --> 02:02:41,936
Hey...

1534
02:02:41,936 --> 02:02:44,480
- Pirate? What was it?
- Did you see it?

1535
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,066
- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

1536
02:02:50,819 --> 02:02:54,531
- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

1537
02:02:58,827 --> 02:03:03,082
No. We don't go there.
What?

1538
02:03:03,082 --> 02:03:05,251
- Come on, guys!
- Shh!

1539
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,009
Nelson, give me that.

1540
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:18,305
Are you sure?

1541
02:03:36,074 --> 02:03:37,576
Fuck...

1542
02:03:44,291 --> 02:03:46,126
It's a female.

1543
02:03:47,168 --> 02:03:48,837
Kill it.

1544
02:04:06,021 --> 02:04:08,440
- Whoo!
- Ya!

1545
02:04:14,112 --> 02:04:17,032
It's moving. It's moving.

1546
02:04:17,032 --> 02:04:19,784
- What?
- It's not dead. It's not dead.

1547
02:04:19,784 --> 02:04:22,996
- It's moving.
- It's not dead.

1548
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:28,209
- What's he doing?
- No, no, no.

1549
02:04:29,711 --> 02:04:31,713
Ah, again! Do it again!

1550
02:04:42,515 --> 02:04:45,769
<i>Jarmo! Jarmo... la tempe.</i>

1551
02:04:53,735 --> 02:04:55,737
Hey, you did it!

1552
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:10,920
Hunter Jarmo! Big
hunter! Come on!

1553
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:15,549
- Give him applause! Hey!
- Jarmo!
Jarmo! Jarmo...

1554
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,764
- Big donkey hunt!
- Come on, speech!

1555
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:25,101
- Okay, okay!
- The donkey fairytale...

1556
02:05:25,101 --> 02:05:28,104
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Thank you very much.

1557
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:34,026
Okay... To kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

1558
02:05:34,026 --> 02:05:37,071
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

1559
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:40,533
- To paint!
- To paint, yes!

1560
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:44,287
To paint a donkey!

1561
02:05:44,287 --> 02:05:47,123
Yes!

1562
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:52,461
Let's take a look
at the expression.

1563
02:05:52,461 --> 02:05:55,172
- Who did this one?
- Me.

1564
02:05:55,172 --> 02:05:58,551
Okay, the feet are
close, close together.

1565
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:01,971
This donkey wants
to be in control.

1566
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:05,433
But it looks almost scared.

1567
02:06:06,225 --> 02:06:08,477
You want to tell
this donkey to...

1568
02:06:09,478 --> 02:06:11,397
...to not be so scared.

1569
02:06:11,397 --> 02:06:16,444
To lose control and bound away
across the fields,

1570
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:19,322
wildly waving its tail!

1571
02:06:20,323 --> 02:06:23,868
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

1572
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:29,040
Huh?

1573
02:06:30,499 --> 02:06:32,627
- Carl?
- Yeah.

1574
02:06:35,171 --> 02:06:37,466
What are you doing
with your hand?

1575
02:06:40,177 --> 02:06:43,221
- Which one?
- Seriously?

1576
02:06:47,768 --> 02:06:50,062
I'm just resting
it on the chair.

1577
02:06:52,189 --> 02:06:55,525
Why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair?

1578
02:06:57,194 --> 02:06:58,779
What...?

1579
02:06:59,696 --> 02:07:01,990
It was just...
I don't know, it was there,

1580
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:04,785
resting on the side
of... the chair.

1581
02:07:27,724 --> 02:07:30,811
I'm coming.
I'm coming!

1582
02:07:32,104 --> 02:07:33,855
I'm coming...

1583
02:07:33,855 --> 02:07:36,650
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, God!

1584
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:54,626
Okay, you know...

1585
02:07:54,626 --> 02:07:58,338
...if you can't handle it,
just tell me, nobody's
forcing you to do anything.

1586
02:07:58,338 --> 02:08:02,426
It's just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone.

1587
02:08:02,426 --> 02:08:05,721
It's too much. It's...
it's becoming unbearable.

1588
02:08:05,721 --> 02:08:09,559
I mean, they're obviously
not happy with what
we're doing in here.

1589
02:08:11,978 --> 02:08:16,399
Okay, so... Let's just...
tell them the truth.

1590
02:08:19,736 --> 02:08:25,074
You give me something, and I
give you something in return.

1591
02:08:30,163 --> 02:08:32,790
You realize what position
that puts me in?

1592
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:35,209
No.

1593
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,049
Well, just because it's
more open that you're
a flesh peddler,

1594
02:08:41,049 --> 02:08:42,926
it doesn't mean
they're gonna accept the fact

1595
02:08:42,926 --> 02:08:45,637
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

1596
02:08:46,304 --> 02:08:48,181
Wow...

1597
02:08:49,265 --> 02:08:50,850
Oh, come on, I didn't...

1598
02:08:50,850 --> 02:08:53,311
Do you know the amount of work
I put into this island?

1599
02:08:53,311 --> 02:08:56,481
- I go fishing every day,
I make fire...
- I know, I know.

1600
02:08:56,481 --> 02:08:59,108
- I'm responsible
for everybody here!
- I know, I'm sorry, I know.

1601
02:08:59,108 --> 02:09:03,238
- Shouldn't that give
me an advantage?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1602
02:09:03,238 --> 02:09:06,991
- Okay!
- You deserve to do
what you want, I know.

1603
02:09:14,958 --> 02:09:17,961
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

1604
02:09:17,961 --> 02:09:20,838
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

1605
02:09:23,675 --> 02:09:27,512
But, really, maybe we
should just do that, maybe
we should just get on with it.

1606
02:09:27,512 --> 02:09:30,515
I don't know, kiss a little
bit in public and hold hands.

1607
02:09:30,515 --> 02:09:33,268
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about Yaya?

1608
02:09:33,268 --> 02:09:37,355
I would have a conversation
with Yaya. I would have to
be an adult about it.

1609
02:09:37,355 --> 02:09:42,110
And figure it out, but...
I think it would be easier
for her, probably.

1610
02:09:42,110 --> 02:09:44,863
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

1611
02:09:44,863 --> 02:09:47,199
Carl, I... I don't know.

1612
02:09:55,708 --> 02:09:58,168
Do you want me
to break up with Yaya?

1613
02:09:58,168 --> 02:09:59,878
- No.
- No?

1614
02:10:02,006 --> 02:10:04,550
That's your decision, not mine.

1615
02:10:07,386 --> 02:10:11,515
I'm not asking you to do it,
I'm just seeing what
you think about it.

1616
02:10:11,515 --> 02:10:15,185
I know, but that doesn't
mean that you can put me
in-between the two of you.

1617
02:10:15,185 --> 02:10:16,729
Okay, okay.

1618
02:10:24,987 --> 02:10:27,573
It's kind of a perfect
scenario for you, I mean...

1619
02:10:29,074 --> 02:10:31,410
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

1620
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:33,746
no responsibilities, you know.

1621
02:10:33,746 --> 02:10:35,915
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

1622
02:10:35,915 --> 02:10:39,460
Because I feel like I
need to know where
this is going, Abigail.

1623
02:10:41,879 --> 02:10:43,923
Let's just have fun.

1624
02:10:43,923 --> 02:10:46,258
No, but I need to try to deal
with this situation.

1625
02:10:46,258 --> 02:10:48,344
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1626
02:10:50,596 --> 02:10:52,932
I don't wanna annoy
anyone anymore.

1627
02:10:55,267 --> 02:10:59,021
Do you remember what you said
the first night you were here?

1628
02:10:59,021 --> 02:11:00,856
What did you say?

1629
02:11:02,942 --> 02:11:05,778
"I love you, you give me fish."

1630
02:11:05,778 --> 02:11:07,446
Exactly.

1631
02:11:07,446 --> 02:11:10,783
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

1632
02:11:10,783 --> 02:11:12,368
- No.
- Like you...

1633
02:11:12,368 --> 02:11:14,870
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

1634
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:23,046
So, Nelson... you're
a pirate, huh?

1635
02:11:24,464 --> 02:11:26,299
Come on, stop it.

1636
02:11:26,633 --> 02:11:27,884
In den Wolken?

1637
02:11:28,385 --> 02:11:31,638
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

1638
02:11:31,638 --> 02:11:34,140
How much money do you make?

1639
02:11:35,475 --> 02:11:37,310
Yeah, of course.

1640
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:40,647
I don't know,
like... 3,000 euros.

1641
02:11:40,647 --> 02:11:42,983
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

1642
02:11:43,817 --> 02:11:45,569
If we succeed.

1643
02:11:46,528 --> 02:11:49,656
So, you work on commission, huh?

1644
02:11:49,656 --> 02:11:51,658
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1645
02:11:51,658 --> 02:11:54,077
The client is making all money?

1646
02:11:54,869 --> 02:11:58,206
Yeah, but you can make more
if you have your own boat.

1647
02:12:00,625 --> 02:12:04,212
3,000 euros...
Come on, you're crazy.

1648
02:12:05,171 --> 02:12:07,632
My girlfriend is expensive.

1649
02:12:07,632 --> 02:12:10,385
What? You invest in
your girlfriend?

1650
02:12:10,385 --> 02:12:12,470
- Yeah.
- Ah...

1651
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:15,140
You should do it
the other way around.

1652
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,518
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

1653
02:12:18,518 --> 02:12:19,686
Yeah?

1654
02:12:20,312 --> 02:12:22,647
Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

1655
02:12:38,413 --> 02:12:40,290
Hey.

1656
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:43,251
I was just wondering
if I could borrow the backpack.

1657
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:45,962
- Abigail?
- Yeah, I know.

1658
02:12:45,962 --> 02:12:47,631
- What are you going
to do, Yaya?

1659
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:49,342
- Go for a hike over
the mountain.

1660
02:12:49,342 --> 02:12:51,594
See if I can find something.

1661
02:12:54,847 --> 02:12:58,726
- I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

1662
02:12:58,726 --> 02:13:02,605
No, Yaya, it's not safe for you
to go alone. I'll go with you.

1663
02:13:03,898 --> 02:13:05,441
Okay.

1664
02:13:09,862 --> 02:13:13,908
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

1665
02:13:13,908 --> 02:13:16,077
I need some time alone with her.

1666
02:13:16,077 --> 02:13:17,620
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1667
02:13:23,626 --> 02:13:25,503
I'll take it.

1668
02:13:53,364 --> 02:13:55,658
I'm glad we're doing
this together, Yaya.

1669
02:13:57,618 --> 02:13:59,120
Me, too.

1670
02:13:59,912 --> 02:14:02,498
I actually wanted
to tell you that I'm...

1671
02:14:02,498 --> 02:14:05,418
...really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

1672
02:14:06,252 --> 02:14:10,089
I mean, you managed to run
a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

1673
02:14:17,805 --> 02:14:20,975
You domesticated
all the old alpha males.

1674
02:14:20,975 --> 02:14:22,477
Yeah!

1675
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:26,690
Thank you.

1676
02:14:30,485 --> 02:14:32,571
No, it's really impressive.

1677
02:14:40,621 --> 02:14:43,123
We should stick together, huh?

1678
02:15:08,857 --> 02:15:10,567
Oh, my God...

1679
02:15:13,528 --> 02:15:16,406
I think it should be
a little easier from here.

1680
02:15:52,442 --> 02:15:53,694
In den Wolken!

1681
02:15:56,447 --> 02:15:58,408
In den Wolken!

1682
02:16:15,717 --> 02:16:18,595
Gucci bag, Louis Vuitton, Chanel...

1683
02:16:19,804 --> 02:16:21,347
Same factory.

1684
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:40,783
Rolex, sunglasses, selfie stick.

1685
02:16:46,205 --> 02:16:48,207
In den Wolken, Uli.

1686
02:16:53,671 --> 02:16:55,840
<i> Nein, nein.</i>

1687
02:16:57,842 --> 02:16:59,427
Huh?

1688
02:17:18,529 --> 02:17:19,739
What you mean?

1689
02:17:21,407 --> 02:17:22,492
What you mean?

1690
02:17:33,629 --> 02:17:34,588
Nein, nein, nein...

1691
02:17:34,755 --> 02:17:36,173
I got my own wife.

1692
02:17:36,423 --> 02:17:38,259
In den Wolken!

1693
02:17:45,849 --> 02:17:47,851
Abigail!

1694
02:17:47,851 --> 02:17:49,353
Yeah?

1695
02:17:50,437 --> 02:17:52,439
I see something!

1696
02:17:56,026 --> 02:17:59,071
A what?

1697
02:18:00,864 --> 02:18:03,909
I can't hear you!

1698
02:18:07,037 --> 02:18:10,207
- Abigail! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

1699
02:18:11,375 --> 02:18:13,752
- Abigail!
- Yaya!

1700
02:18:15,879 --> 02:18:19,383
Yaya!

1701
02:18:19,383 --> 02:18:20,926
Abigail!

1702
02:18:22,553 --> 02:18:26,056
Abigail!
Abigail, there's an elevator!

1703
02:18:28,726 --> 02:18:31,186
- It's a resort, Abigail!
- A what?

1704
02:18:31,186 --> 02:18:32,938
It's a resort!

1705
02:18:36,442 --> 02:18:40,529
Come, look! It's
a luxury resort!

1706
02:18:44,909 --> 02:18:47,244
It's been there the whole time!

1707
02:18:47,244 --> 02:18:50,539
It's been there
the whole fucking time, Abigail!

1708
02:19:04,471 --> 02:19:05,889
Come.

1709
02:19:08,975 --> 02:19:12,228
Come, Abigail. Come.

1710
02:19:19,694 --> 02:19:21,112
Abigail?

1711
02:19:23,365 --> 02:19:25,659
Let's enjoy this moment.

1712
02:20:00,569 --> 02:20:03,029
- It's surreal, huh?
- Yeah.

1713
02:20:17,502 --> 02:20:19,963
You must be excited
to see your kids, huh?

1714
02:20:21,506 --> 02:20:24,509
- I don't have kids.
- Ah...

1715
02:20:26,136 --> 02:20:27,637
Sorry.

1716
02:20:38,316 --> 02:20:39,817
Let's go.

1717
02:20:41,736 --> 02:20:43,362
I need to wee-wee.

1718
02:20:44,113 --> 02:20:46,240
- Yeah.
- And then we will go.

1719
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:47,658
Okay.

1720
02:21:55,268 --> 02:21:56,727
Abigail?

1721
02:22:01,107 --> 02:22:03,442
Abigail, I can try and help you.

1722
02:22:05,444 --> 02:22:07,780
I don't know how, but...

1723
02:22:12,119 --> 02:22:16,748
Abigail... maybe you can come
and work for me?

1724
02:22:17,207 --> 02:22:19,293
You could be my assistant.

1725
02:22:26,466 --> 02:22:27,968
Aargh!

1726
02:22:42,149 --> 02:22:43,442
Fuck!

1727
02:22:45,569 --> 02:22:46,862
Aargh!
