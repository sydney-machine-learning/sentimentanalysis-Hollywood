00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:55,011
[Autje] This story ends
before you were born.

Mother.

[Eerie music playing]

5
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,491
Again.

[Agata speaking indistinctly]

7
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,278
[Autje] When we woke up

8
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:27,976
feeling hands that
were no longer there,

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,699
the elders told us
that it was the work of ghosts

10
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,570
or Satan.

11
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,138
[Eerie music fades]

12
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,988
Or that we were lying
to get attention.

13
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:43,451
Or that it was an act
of wild female imagination.

14
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,719
It went on for years.

15
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,636
To all of us.

16
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,145
It felt like weightlessness.

17
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,799
[Girl laughing]

18
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:10,217
It felt like drifting over
what used to be real.

19
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:16,373
- [Girl speaking indistinctly]
- It felt like a banishment,

20
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:18,070
as though we had
no invitation anymore

21
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:19,922
to be a part of the real.

22
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,841
[Girl speaking indistinctly]

23
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,083
I used to wonder who I would be

24
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,955
if it hadn't happened to me.

25
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,460
I used to miss the person
I might have been.

26
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,115
I don't anymore.

27
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,443
Because it's doomsday

28
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,947
and a call to prayer.

29
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,341
It's both.

00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,172
- [Suspenseful music playing]
- [Man panting]

31
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,827
We caught one of them.

32
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,873
I saw his face.

33
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:00,745
And then he named the others.

34
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,226
[Man] Come on.

[Man groaning]

39
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,517
[Autje] Eventually the attackers

40
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,780
were taken to the police
in the city

41
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,173
for their own protection.

[Screaming]

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,530
Almost all of the men
of the colony

44
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:27,792
went to the city to post bail

45
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,165
for the attackers.

46
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,578
We were given two days

47
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,822
to forgive the attackers
before they returned.

48
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,758
If we did not forgive them

49
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,934
we would be ordered
to leave the colony

50
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,894
and be denied entry
into the kingdom of heaven.

51
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,006
[Suspenseful music stops]

[Neitje] Do nothing.

53
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,413
[Salome] Stay and fight.

54
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:03,852
[Both] Leave.

55
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:05,893

[Woman 2 speaking indistinctly]

59
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:35,599
[Autje] Girls in our colony
had very little schooling.

60
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,016
We hardly knew
how to read or to write.

61
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,517
But that day,

62
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,996
we learned how to vote.

63
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,239

[Indistinct talking]

65
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,791
The vote was tied between

66
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,838
staying and fighting,
or leaving.

67
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,754
So three families
including yours and mine

68
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,146
were elected to decide

69
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,911
what the women
of the colony would do.

70
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,770
Your mother had asked,
August, the school teacher,

71
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,207
to take the minutes
of our meeting.

72
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:06,124
August came back to the colony
just recently.

73
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:09,107
His family had been
excommunicated years ago.

74
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:20,510
August had loved your mother
since he was a boy.

75

[Chuckles softly]

76
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,505
Before we began,

77
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,159
your grandmother, agata,

78
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,533
told us we had to honor
our service to each other.

79
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:47,165
We had to represent it.

80
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,862
Just as the disciples
were washed

81
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:51,517
by Jesus at the last supper,

82
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,109
knowing that his hour had come.

83
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,438
We only had 24 hours

84
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,334
to imagine what world
you would be born into.

85
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,293
[Melancholic music fades]

86
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,316
[Scarface janz] It is a part
of our faith to forgive.

87
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,231
We have always forgiven those
who have wronged us.

88
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,319
Why not now?

89
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,799
Because now we know better.

90
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,410
We will be excommunicated,

91
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,107
forced to leave the colony
in disgrace

92
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,785
if we do not forgive these men.

93
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,198
And if we are excommunicated,

94
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,157
we forfeit our place in heaven.

95
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,422
How could any of you
live with the fear of that?

96
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,622
[Agata] These are
legitimate fears.

97
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,470
How can we address them?

98
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,994
[Scarface janz] The only
important thing to establish

99
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,933
is if we forgive the men.

100
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,391
So that we will be allowed
to enter the gates of heaven.

101

[Scoffs]

102
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,176
[Mariche] You can laugh
all you like, salome,

103
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,526
but we will be forced
to leave the colony

104
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,670
if we don't forgive the men.

105
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,138
How will the lord
when he arrives

106
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,879
find the women
if we aren't in the colony?

107
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,489
Jesus is able to return to life,

108
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,882
live for thousands of years

109
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,361
and then drop down
to earth from heaven

110
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,580
to scoop up his supporters,

111
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,277
surely he'd also
be able to locate

112
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,409
a few women
who left their colony.

113
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,497
Let's stay on track.

114
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,716
All right. I'll stay on track.

115
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,631
I cannot forgive them.

116
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,352
I will never forgive them.

117
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,876
I can't either.

118
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:08,768
But we want to enter

119
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,074
the kingdom of heaven
when we die.

120
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:11,316
[Grunts]

121
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,341
We have everything we want here.

122
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,516
[Salome] No.

123
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,846
Want less.

124
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,041
[Scoffs]

125
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,347
Does entering
the kingdom of heaven

126
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,001
mean nothing to any of you?

127
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,568
Surely there must be something

128
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,135
worth living for in this life,
not only in the next.

129
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,378
- [Scoffs]
- [Chuckles]

130
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,019
Autje!

131
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,281
- See you soon. It's all right.
- [Helena] Sorry.

132
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,872
It's all right.
It will be all right.

133
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,337
[Autje] Your grandmother
used to say,

134
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,426
"find out where
you can be of help

135
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,757
"and leave what
you can't help behind."

136
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:02,996
I think that's easier

137
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,737
when you're old like her.

138
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,826
[Agata] So we must decide now

139
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,916
to stay and fight, or leave.

140
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,160
Those are the options
in front of us.

141
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,816
We will not do nothing.

142
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:22,431
I want to talk about
my horses Ruth and Cheryl.

143
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,019
[Dogs barking]

144
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,804
When Ruth and Cheryl
are frightened by dueck's dogs

145
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,676
on the mile road
that leads to the church,

146
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,615
their initial instinct
is to bolt.

147
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:34,922
Whoa!

148
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,641
These horses
don't organize meetings

149
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,623
to decide what they will do.

150
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:42,209
They run.

151
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,560
But, Greta, we are not animals.

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,866
We have been preyed upon
like animals.

153
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,347
Maybe we should respond
like animals.

154
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,435
[Agata] In my lifetime,
I have seen

155
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,393
horses confront angry dogs

156
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,439
and try to stomp them to death.

157
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,875
Animals don't always flee.

158
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,573
Is this how we want
to teach our daughters

159
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,226
to defend themselves?

160
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,401
By fleeing?

161
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,577
Not fleeing but leaving.

162
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,795
I was just talking
about leaving.

163
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,927
[Salome] I would rather
stand my ground

164
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,102
and shoot each man in the heart

165
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,538
and Bury 'em in a pit than flee.

166
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,192
And I'll deal with god's wrath
if I have to.

167
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,976
Salome, aunt Greta is talking
about leaving not fleeing.

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,848
The word "fleeing"
wasn't what she meant.

169
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,894
Yeah. Please forgive my mother
for using the wrong word.

170
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,113
It's a sin so outrageous

171
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,723
that salome has taken it
upon herself

172
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,943
to rectify for the sake
of all humanity.

173
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,467
[Agata] "Leaving" and "fleeing"
are different words

174
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:24,556
with different meanings.

175
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,669
They each say
something about us.

176
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,870
August,

177
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:36,046
what do you make of all of this?

178
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,898
Do you have an opinion too?

179
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,596
I think...

180
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,663
I think that it is possible

181
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,776
to leave something or someone...

182
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,931
In one frame of mind

183
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:55,413
and arrive elsewhere in another

184
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,024
entirely unexpected
frame of mind.

185
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,809
I want to stay and fight.

186
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,071
But won't we lose the fight
to the men

187
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,073
and be forced
to forgive them anyway?

188
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,422
I want to stay and fight too.

189
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:05,945
[Mariche] No one's surprised
that you do.

190
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,512
All you do is fight.

191
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,296
Is this really
how we are to decide

192
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,647
the fates of all the women
in this colony? [Scoffs]

193
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,126
Just another vote

194
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,215
where we put an x
next to our position?

195
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,043
I thought we were here
to do more than that.

196
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,305
You mean talk more about

197
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,350
forgiving the men
and doing nothing.

198
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:20,743
Everything else is insane.

199
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,527
But none of you
will listen to reason.

200
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,224
Well, why are you here with us?

201
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,661
Why are you still here with us
if that is what you believe?

202
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,097
Just leave with the rest
of the do nothing women.

203
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,080
She is my daughter
and I want her here with us.

204
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,625
Is forgiveness
that's forced upon us

205
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:34,737
true forgiveness?

206
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,933
[Sighs]

207
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,176
[Salome] Keep nonsense
like that to yourself please.

208
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:40,893
Autje, get down!

209
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,919
[Greta] Autje,
listen to your mother!

210
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:44,767
Behave yourself.

211
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,551
Don't you hear
the rafter's creaking?

212
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,446
Do you want the roof to cave in?

213
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,191
[Autje] Many of us
saw ourselves from above.

214
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,823
I'm not sure if it was god

215
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,545
and we were seeing ourselves
through his eyes.

216
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,349
[Clanging]

217
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,375
Or if we just couldn't be there.

218
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,791
In our own bodies.

219
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,077
[Melancholic music playing]

220
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,926
[Neitje] How'd you get up there?

221
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,362
[Autje] It was a miracle.

222
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,713
[Neitje chuckles]
A miracle from god.

223
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,377
- [Autje] Of course.
- [Neitje] What else?

224
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,369
[Autje] Where I come from,

225
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:24,134
where your mother comes from,

226
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:28,419
we didn't talk about our bodies.

227
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,942
So when something
like this happened

228
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,510
there was no language for it.

229
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:36,277
And without language for it,
there was a gaping silence.

230
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:41,108
And in that gaping silence
was the real horror.

231
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,174
[Sobbing]

232
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,238
Neitje's mother hanged herself

233
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,960
after the attacks
had gone on for a while.

234
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,027
It made us wonder,

235
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,855
why did our feet
keep moving forward

236
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,446
when hers just couldn't.

237
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:00,859
What sets us apart

238
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,711
from the ones
who get left behind?

239
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,061
[Melancholic music fades]

240
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,259
This is never going to end.

241
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,043
We'll be dead
and they'll still be talking.

242
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,523
Or worse.
We'll have to live through it.

243
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:13,635
[Chuckles softly]

244
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,440
[Ona] August, I think
you should make lists

245
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,659
of the pros and cons
of both options.

246
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,077
"Staying and fighting"
and "leaving."

247
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,082
Post it on the wall.

248
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:30,889
Make sure and write large.

249
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,021
[Mejal] Why?

250
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,892
We can't read it.

251
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,328
No, but we'll keep it here
as an artifact

252
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,093
for others to discover.

253
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,768
I think the first heading
should say,

254
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,206
"staying and fighting"
and under that write "pros".

255
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,208
[Agata] Who will go first?

256
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,340
We're starting with
staying and fighting, pros.

257
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,714
Why do we need this?
This is our home.

258
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,302
[Mariche]
That's what you believe,

259
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,043
it's not what everyone believes.

260
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,261
- Excuse me.
- [All arguing]

261
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,002
[August] Forgive me.
Excuse me, um...

262
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,918
May I request that you
take it in turns speaking

263
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,529
so that I can understand
what each of you is saying.

264
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:03,748
It takes me
a second to transcribe.

265
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,184
Should we put up our hands

266
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,008
as though we are children
in your schoolhouse?

267
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,188
I...

268
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,929
I apologize.

269
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,105
We won't have to leave.

270
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,783
- Sorry.
- Will you just write it down?

271
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:16,674
Under pros.

272
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,937
Salome has had a brilliant idea

273
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,939
that if we stay
we won't have to leave.

274
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,462
[Mejal] We won't
have to figure out

275
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,073
where we are going
or experience the uncertainty

276
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,336
of not knowing
where we are going.

277
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,424
We don't have a map.

278
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,860
[Salome] That's absurd.

279
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,470
The only certainty we'll know
is uncertainty,

280
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,255
no matter where we are.

281
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,734
[Agata] Neitje? Autje?

282
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,935
Do you have something
to add to the list?

283
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,610
We won't have
to leave the people we love.

284
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,699
Well, we could bring
our loved ones

285
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,266
with us if we leave.

286
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,920
How?

287
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,574
What does that mean?
That we move the whole colony?

288
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,141
What could that possibly mean?

289
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,535
[Agata] We could create
the possibility of a new order

290
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,973
right here in a place
that is familiar to us.

291
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,802
[Salome] Not simply familiar,
but a place that is ours.

292
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,456
[Mejal] Do we need
to write the cons?

293
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,024
Isn't it obvious
that we must stay and fight?

294
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,833
Cons. We won't be forgiven.

295
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,444
May I say something?

296
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,683
Please.

297
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,120
Would it be a good idea
before we list

298
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,991
the pros and cons
of "staying and fighting"

299
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,688
to talk about exactly what it is

300
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:15,951
we're fighting for?

301
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,387
[Salome] It's obvious.

302
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,605
We are fighting for our safety

303
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:19,911
and for our freedom
from attacks.

304
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,566
[Ona] But what would
that mean to us?

305
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,350
Perhaps we need a statement
which describes

306
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,743
what we want the colony
to be like

307
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,658
after winning the fight.

308
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,138
Perhaps we need
to understand more

309
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,704
what it is
we are fighting to achieve,

310
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,272
not only what we are fighting
to destroy.

311
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:34,839
- [Groans]
- [Chuckles]

312
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,710
Are we staying or are we going?

313
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:37,779
[Laughing]

314
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,758
Ona, please tell us more

315
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,002
about the statement
you're thinking about.

316
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,373
Men and women would make

317
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:50,009
all decisions
for the colony collectively.

318
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,727
Women would be allowed to think.

319
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:57,427
Girls will be taught
to read and to write.

320
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,646
The schoolhouse must display
a map of the world

321
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,998
so that we can begin
to understand our place in it.

322
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,174
A new religion,
taken from the old

323
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,026
but focused on love

324
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,942
would be created
by the women of the colony.

325
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,771
Our children would be safe.

326
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,994
"Collectively."

327

[Chuckles softly]

329
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,703
Ona, you're a dreamer.

330
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:36,031
We're women without a voice.

331
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,423
We have nothing to return to.

332
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,382
Even the animals
are safer in their homes

333
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,297
than we women are.

334
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,560
All we have are our dreams.

335
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,499
So of course we are dreamers.

336
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,415
And you want to hear my dream?

337
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,570
I dream that people
who speak nonsense,

338
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,093
who have no grasp on reality,

339
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,337
are not put in charge
of making statements.

340
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,013
What if the men
refuse to meet our demands?

- [Bucket clanging]

342
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,084
Sorry.

343
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,698
We'll kill them.

344
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:12,917
No, ona.

[Laughing]

346
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,123
What if the men
who are in prison

347
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,148
are not guilty?

348

[Mariche] Autje.

351
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,826
Why are you asking
if they're...?

352
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,132
Autje, shush.

353
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,307
We caught one of them.

[Screaming]

355
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,093
I saw him.

356
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,529
[Mariche] But only one.

357
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,139
[Salome] Yes, only one,
but he named the others.

358
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,880
But what if he was lying?

359

[Eerie music stops]

360
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,623
We must consider this.

361
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,887
No! That is not
our responsibility

362
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,149
because we aren't in charge

363
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,673
of whether or not
they are punished.

364
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,458
We know that
we've been attacked by men.

365
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,547
Not by ghosts or Satan

366
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,288
as we were led to believe
for so long.

367
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:02,639
We know that we've not
imagined these attacks.

368
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:05,642
That we were made unconscious
with cow tranquilizer.

369
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:09,080
We know that we are bruised,
and infected,

370
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:12,605
and pregnant, and terrified,
and insane,

371
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,781
and some of us are dead.

372
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:17,175
We know that
we must protect our children.

373
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,439
Regardless of who is guilty.

374
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:24,119
All right, salome. Thank you.
Please, sit down, hmm.

375
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:26,556
Hmm.

376
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,276
Shall we move on?

377
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,820
It is possible the men in prison

378
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,300
are not guilty of the attacks,

379
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,998
but are they guilty
of not stopping the attacks?

380
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,217
Are they guilty of knowing

381
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,740
about the attacks
and doing nothing?

382
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,220
How should we know
what they're guilty of or not?

383
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,787
[Ona] But we do know.

384
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,224
We do know that the conditions
have been created by men

385
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,618
and that these attacks
have been made possible

386
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:11,360
because of the circumstances
of the colony.

387
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,709
And those circumstances

388
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,233
have been created
and ordained by the men.

389
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,148
[Mariche] But wait,
aren't you suggesting

390
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,846
that the attackers
are as much victims

391
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,458
as the victims of the attacks?

392
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,329
That all of us, men and women

393
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,157
are victims of the circumstances

394
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,314
from which the colony
has been created.

395
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,599
In a sense, yes.

396
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:36,931
So then, even if the court
finds them guilty or innocent,

397
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,302
they are... [breathes shakily]

398
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,110
After all innocent.

399
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,201
Yes, I would say so.

400
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,226
- The elders called them evil.
- [Ona] That's not true.

401
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,531
It's the elder's quest for power

402
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,837
that is responsible.

403
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,012
Because they needed
to have those...

404
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,622
Those they'd have power over.

405
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,145
And those people are us.

406
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,843
[Agata] And they have taught
the lesson of power

407
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,671
to the boys and men
of the colony,

408
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,959
and the boys and men
have been excellent students.

409
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,267
Don't we all
want some sort of power?

410
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,269
I think so.

411
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,227
But I'm not sure.

412
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,708
But we caught them.

413
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,666
We caught them.

414
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,733
Yes, you did.

415
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:23,258
Then why are you
making it so complicated?

416
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,285
This is very, very boring.

417
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,897
We could ask the men to leave.

418
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,293
Ask the men to leave?

419
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:41,058
None of us have ever
asked the men for anything.

420
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,649
Not a single thing.

421
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,020
Not even for
the salt to be passed.

422
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:50,589
Not even for a penny,
or a moment alone.

423
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:54,071
Or to take the washing in,
or to open a curtain,

424
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,248
or to go easy
on the small yearlings.

425
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,903
Or to put your hand
on the small of my back

426
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:03,167
while I try again
for the 12th or 13th time

427
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,759
to push a baby out of my body.

428
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,218
Isn't it interesting

429
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:15,353
that the one and only request
we women would have of the men

430
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,292
would be for them to leave?

431
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,212
[All laughing]

432
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:33,830
[Greta] Asking the men to leave
is not an option.

433
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,310
Oh!

434
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,334
I'd like you to imagine
Ruth and Cheryl.

435
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,620
[Agata] No. Not again.

436
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,493
[Ona] Please stop.

437
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:48,212
Look. August is still
taking the minutes.

438
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,996
[Laughter]

439
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,415
I can't believe August
is still taking the minutes.

440
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,787
[Autje] Sometimes I think
people laugh

441
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,726
as hard as they'd like to cry.

442
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,688
[Agata] August, you must think
we're all lunatics.

443
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,101
I don't.

444
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,737
And it doesn't matter
what I think, anyway.

445
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,411
Is that true?

446
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,515
Do you really think it doesn't
matter what you think?

447
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,680
How would you feel
if in your entire life

448
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,532
it never mattered
what you thought?

449
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,947
But I'm not here to think.

450
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,994
I'm here to take the minutes
of your meeting.

451
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:33,257
But if in your entire life
you truly felt

452
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,172
it didn't matter
what you thought,

453
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,893
how would that make you feel?

454
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,620
When we've liberated ourselves,

455
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,168
we will have to ask ourselves
who we are.

I have to give
little miep her antibiotics.

461
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,784
Where did you get antibiotics?

462
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,613
[Agata] She walked.

463
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:47,113
She walked for a day and a half

464
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,072
to the mobile clinic

465
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,098

in miep's applesauce

going to be like this now?

Is nettie always
going to be a man now?

510
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,267
[Autje] Later,
we understood that nettie

511
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,816
didn't become a man
because of what happened.

512

felt like a woman.

if the baby was yours,

I think it
was likely yours though...

00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,335
but a way of seeing the world,
and us women,

720
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,641
which has been allowed
to take hold

721
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,623
of men's hearts and minds.

722
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:41,170
[Neitje] So if we leave...
If we leave

723
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:43,283
I will never see
my brothers again?

724
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,504
[Autje] Who will
take care of them?

725
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:48,897
Of them all?

726
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,355
[Greta] We can't know
if we will stay or leave

727
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:53,835
before we resolve

728
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:56,339
these last-minute concerns.

729
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,971
I wouldn't call
the future of our relationship

730
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:02,737
with the boys and men we love
"last-minute concerns."

731
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,199
There we go.

732
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:43,885
[Children chattering]

733
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:48,585
[Autje] It was all waiting
to happen before it happened.

734
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,500
You could look back
and follow the breadcrumbs

735
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:52,831
along the path
that led to violence.

736
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,592
When we looked back,

737
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,334
we could see
that it had been everywhere,

738
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:00,403
whether it was happening yet
or not.

739
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:03,581
[Girl] Hi. [Exclaims excitedly]

740
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:06,366
[Children speaking indistinctly]

741
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,290
[Miep] Hi.

742
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:24,036
[Heaving]

743
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:32,610
I'll get you some water.

744
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:42,010
[Melancholic music fades]

745
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:45,797
There's no cup or anything.

746
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:50,584
[Slurps]

747
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,372
[Water splashes]

748
00:43:58,113 --> 00:43:59,158
[Slurps]

749
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:05,860
[Ona sighs]

750
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,351
It's good
that you're here, August.

751
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:22,355
To remind us of what's possible.

752
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:25,967
Because it's easy to forget.

753
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:36,040
I'm so sorry, ona.

754
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,370
[Chuckles]

755
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:40,915
One day I'd like to hear that

756
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,767
from someone
who should be saying it.

757
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,129
Why does love...

758
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,543
The absence of love,
the end of love,

759
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,090
the need for love,

760
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:05,224
result in so much violence?

761
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:12,622
Ona.

762
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:15,799
Ona.

763
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:20,282
I could take care of you

764
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,154
and your child.

765
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:26,593
I would like to.

766
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,792
I, um...

767
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,750
I know,

768
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,174
but you don't have
to say the words.

769
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,912
If I were married,
I wouldn't be myself.

770
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,717
So the person you love
would be gone.

771
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,829
[Chuckles]

772
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,534
[Ona chuckles]

773
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:57,798
Your child...

774
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,235
[August chuckles]

775
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,605
If we stay
and we don't win the fight,

776
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:04,413
my child will be given

777
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,112
to another family here.

778
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:10,898
Maybe even the family
of my attacker.

779
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,250
If we stay
and don't win the fight.

780
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:21,387
You won't let that happen. No.

781
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:22,954
No.

782
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,131
No, I won't.

783
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,476
[Inhales deeply]

784
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,826
[Greta] August,
we need to discuss options

785
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,349
for the men and the older boys,

786
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:52,829
if the women decide to leave.

787
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,700
Which is a waste of time
because we're not leaving.

788
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:56,572
The men should leave with us
if they wish.

789
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:58,313
Then what on earth
is the point of us leaving?

790
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:00,271
Well, they could be allowed
to join the women later

791
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:02,143
once the women
have established themselves

792
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,927
and are thriving.

793
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,407
Should we add

794
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:08,584
"thriving as a collective,
literate community"?

795
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,281
Literate's your word. Not ours.

796
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:11,761
We don't need your university
language to make our plans.

797
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:13,502
Put it in.
We know what it means.

798
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,938
Continue, Greta.

799
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:17,201
Young boys,
simple-minded boys of any age,

800
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:19,682
Cornelius who's confined
to a wheelchair,

801
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:20,857
will accompany the women.

802
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,772
I vote for the first option.

803
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,382
The men should leave with us
if they wish.

804
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:25,644
The first option is ridiculous

805
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,298
and should be
crossed off the list.

806
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,386
[Mariche] Why are some ideas
written down and considered,

807
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,325
and others crossed out?

808
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:32,086
[Sighs]

809
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,697
I want to leave.
I'd like to strangle myself.

810
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:35,872
Mariche, it's possible
that all the men

811
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,352
would choose to leave with us.

812
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:39,354
And then all we'd be doing
is recreating our colony

813
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:40,790
with all of its
dangers elsewhere.

814
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:41,922
[Agata] And the men
would definitely

815
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,271
leave with us because

816
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:44,663
they can't survive without us.

817
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:45,926
Well, not for longer
than a day or two.

818
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,144
[Salome] We have not
decided to leave.

819
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,711
I'd like to remind everyone
of that.

820
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,495
[Agata] And how can we leave
at all if we've never

821
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,933
been allowed to even see
a map of the world?

822
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,587
[August] I can secure
a world map for you.

823
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:59,461
I also have a, um,
map of this specific region.

824
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:01,028
Well, that will do.

825
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:03,421
It's not like we are planning
to travel the planet.

826
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:04,988
[Ona] Perhaps we are.

827
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:06,337
Did you know
that the migration period

828
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:08,644
for butterflies
and dragonflies is so long

829
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,167
that it's often
only the grandchildren

830
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:12,498
that arrive
at the intended destination?

831
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:15,805
Yes. So, it...

832
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,350
Yes.

833
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:21,352
Perhaps, if we went beyond
where the map showed us,

834
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:24,051
we could create
our own map as we go.

835
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,033
So now you want to leave, ona?

836
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,754
[Breathing heavily]

837
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:33,649
[Agata] Are you all right,
mejal?

838
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:39,327
Nope. She's having
one of her episodes.

839
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,329
[Mejal gasping]

840
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:43,200
[Agata] Father almighty,

841
00:48:43,224 --> 00:48:45,942
in all humility
and supplication we ask thee

842
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,489
for thy abundant kindness

843
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:49,380
at this moment.

844
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:51,513
We beseech thee

845
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:54,951
to have mercy
on our sister mejal.

846
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,388
- [Screaming]
- Please, in your beneficence,

847
00:48:57,412 --> 00:48:59,173
heal her.

848
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:01,349
- And please...
- [Inaudible]

849
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:04,656
We ask of thee, envelop her

850
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,485
in your strength
and everlasting love,

851
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:09,139
and please drive out
the sickness

852
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:11,035
which afflicts her now.

853
00:49:12,558 --> 00:49:13,951
[Mejal sobs and exhales]

854
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:18,433
[Mejal breathing heavily]

855
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,943
[Weakly] Help me up.

856
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,925
[Agata sighs in relief]
Praise be to god.

857
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,515
Why is it
only mejal has these...?

858
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:38,690
Be quiet.

859
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:39,889
We were all attacked.

860
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:41,955
Not all of us need to draw

861
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,676
so much attention to ourselves.

862
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,548
[Laughing]

863
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:49,005
What attention?

864
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,180
I speak less
than all of you put together.

865
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,355
How have I offended you?

866
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:53,357
[Mariche] You have
these attacks.

867
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,620
You smoke.

868
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:59,189
Why? Why is it so much
harder for you than for us?

869
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,322
We were all attacked. All of us.

870
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:04,978
We are wasting our time
by passing this burden,

871
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,154
this sack of stones,
from one to the next,

872
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:10,070
by pushing our pain away.

873
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:13,377
Let's absorb it ourselves.
Let's inhale it.

874
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,489
Let's digest it.

875
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,797
Let's process it into fuel.

876
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:24,891
Speak, mejal.

877
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,936
We are listening.

878
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,160
They made us
disbelieve ourselves.

879
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,473
That was worse than...

880
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,431
[Gasping]

881
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:46,043
[Salome] Mejal.

882
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:55,767
[Ona] Klaas, when he returns,

883
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,378
may take horses or livestock

884
00:50:57,402 --> 00:50:58,640
that we would need
along the way.

885
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,207
[Salome] Along the way?

886
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:01,536
We're not leaving.

887
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,952
You are changing your mind, ona.

888
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:09,240
I don't believe
that's a sin, is it?

889
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:13,829
[Mariche] How will
we be forgiven for all this?

890
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,961
How will we be forgiven,

891
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:18,703
if not by the elders
whom we have disobeyed?

892
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:22,011
Perhaps there will be
other elders or men of god

893
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:23,795
who will be able
to forgive our sins.

894
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,450
We do not need to be forgiven
by the men of god

895
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:27,799
for protecting our children

896
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:29,149
from the depraved actions
of vicious men

897
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,411
who are often the very same men

898
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:32,350
we're meant to ask
for forgiveness!

899
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,634
If god is a loving god then...

900
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:38,225
He will forgive us himself.

901
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,769
If god is a vengeful god

902
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,751
then he has created us
in his image.

903
00:51:44,623 --> 00:51:46,818
If god is omnipotent,

904
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:48,516
then why has he not protected

905
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,803
the women and girls
of this colony?

906
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:58,221
I will destroy

907
00:51:58,245 --> 00:52:02,075
any living thing
that harms my child.

908
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,298
I will tear it limb from limb.

909
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,146
I will desecrate its body

910
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,172
and I will Bury it alive.

911
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:14,933
I will challenge god on the spot

912
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:16,109
to strike me dead

913
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,284
if I have sinned

914
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,721
by protecting my child
from evil,

915
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:22,835
and by destroying that evil
that it may not harm another!

916
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,533
I will lie,

917
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,773
I will hunt, I will kill.

918
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:30,471
I will dance on graves

919
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:33,082
and I will burn forever in hell

920
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:35,215
before I allow another man

921
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,042
to satisfy his violent urges

922
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:39,982
with the body
of my four-year-old child!

923
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:41,680
[Sobbing]

924
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:50,558
[Emotional music playing]

925
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,449
I suggest we think
about what is good.

926
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:15,279
"Whatever is true,

927
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,107
"whatever is honorable,

928
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:20,719
"whatever is just,

929
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,350
"whatever is pure,

930
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,743
"whatever is pleasing,

931
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,639
"whatever is commendable,

932
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,705
"if there is any excellence

933
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:34,056
"and if there
is anything worthy of praise,

934
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,841
"think about these things

935
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:40,173
"and the peace of god
be with you."

936
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,525
I will become a murderer
if I stay.

937
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,235
[Emotional music continues]

938
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:10,247
[Sniffles]

939
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:16,731
[Ona clears throat]

940
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,410
[Ona] I know what these are.
These are letters.

941
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:25,238
But what are these?

942
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,979
[August] They're commas.

943
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:31,529
They signify a short pause,
or a breath in the text.

944
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:37,186
There's also a butterfly
called a comma.

945
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:40,146
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

946
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,846
- [Agata] Salome.
- [Emotional music fades]

947
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:07,541
If you will become a murderer
by staying here in the colony,

948
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:09,064
side by side with the men

949
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:11,351
who are responsible
for the attacks,

950
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:13,614
then you must,

951
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,357
to protect your own soul,

952
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:19,751
leave the colony.

953
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:22,599
We are not all murderers.

954
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,905
Not yet.

955
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:25,254
[Agata] I have done
what the verse

956
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:26,821
from philippians instructed,

957
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:29,195
which is to think
about what is good,

958
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:32,174
what is just, what is pure,

959
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:33,547
what is excellent.

960
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:36,463
Pacifism.

961
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:40,922
Pacifism is good.

962
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:42,164
Any violence

963
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,515
is unjustifiable.

964
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:49,670
By staying here, we women

965
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:52,412
will be betraying
the central tenet of our faith

966
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:53,828
which is pacifism,

967
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,615
because by staying

968
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:03,229
we will knowingly
be placing ourselves

969
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:08,452
in a direct collision course
with violence,

970
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:13,065
either by us or against us.

971
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:19,071
This colony is the only home
I've ever known.

972
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,249
And I don't want to leave.

973
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,338
But by staying,

974
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:27,993
we'll be inviting harm.

975
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,233
We will be in a state of war.

976
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:35,043
We will turn this colony
into a battlefield.

977
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,938
[Ona] We cannot
become murderers.

978
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:43,487
And we cannot endure
any more violence,

979
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:47,404
which is why we must leave.

980
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:10,664
I've also been thinking

981
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:13,623
about the verse from philippians

982
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,867
and I've been thinking
about what is good.

983
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:18,696
Freedom is good.

984
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,786
It is better than slavery.

985
00:57:23,048 --> 00:57:24,789
Forgiveness is good.

986
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,487
It's better than revenge.

987
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,989
And hope for the unknown
is good,

988
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:34,557
it is better than
hatred of the familiar.

989
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:36,627
And what about security,

990
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:40,544
and safety, and home,
and family?

991
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:44,591
What about marriage,

992
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:50,094
and love, ona?

993
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:52,575
[Ona] I don't know
about those things,

994
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,035
any of them.

995
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,734
Except for love

996
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:00,302
and... even love
is mysterious to me.

997
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,542
And I believe that my home

998
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,108
is with my mother,
and my sister,

999
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:06,657
and my unborn child,
wherever that may be.

1000
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,183
Will you not hate that child?

1001
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:15,816
That child's the child of a man

1002
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,581
who inspires
violent thoughts in you.

1003
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:25,240
I already love this child
more than anything.

1004
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,568
He or she
is as innocent and lovable

1005
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,091
as the evening sun.

1006
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:33,248
So too was the child's father
when he was born.

1007
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,752
[Mariche] But, if you're saying

1008
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:41,648
that forgiveness
is better than revenge...

1009
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,368
Aren't you saying
that we must stay here

1010
00:58:46,392 --> 00:58:47,761
and forgive the men?

1011
00:58:47,785 --> 00:58:50,831
We cannot forgive
because we are forced to.

1012
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:58,056
But, with some distance
perhaps I am able

1013
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:03,017
to understand how these crimes
may have occurred.

1014
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,214
And with that distance,

1015
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,719
maybe I am able
to pity these men,

1016
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,331
perhaps forgive them.

1017
00:59:13,245 --> 00:59:15,029
And even love them.

1018
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:19,773
Not fighting. But moving.

1019
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:26,408
Always moving. Never fighting.
Just moving.

1020
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:29,933
Never fighting. Just moving.
Never fighting. Always moving.

1021
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:31,587
Would you snap out of it?

1022
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:32,719
[Salome] You snap out of it.

1023
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:34,068
[Mejal] All of you
snap out of it.

1024
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:36,181
Have you lost your minds?
The sun is gone.

1025
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:42,404
I want to tell another story
about Ruth and Cheryl.

1026
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:49,213
[Chuckles softly]

1027
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:50,543
[Mellow music playing]

1028
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:52,695
I was always frightened

1029
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,548
of the northern road
out of the colony.

1030
00:59:57,637 --> 01:00:00,205
There are so many gullies
on either side of the road.

1031
01:00:03,991 --> 01:00:07,623
The buggy used to lurch
side to side.

1032
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,364
Ruth and Cheryl were simply

1033
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:11,433
following my commands
of the reins,

1034
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,239
but, they were
jerky and frenetic.

1035
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:17,352
And it was dangerous.

1036
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,420
It was only when I learned
to focus my gaze

1037
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:25,075
far down ahead of me

1038
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,555
and not on the road

1039
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:28,688
immediately in front
of Ruth and Cheryl,

1040
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,888
that I started to feel safe.

1041
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:34,718
[Breathing heavily]

1042
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:41,962
Leaving will give us

1043
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,858
the more farseeing perspective
we need

1044
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,034
to forgive.

1045
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,410
Which is to love properly

1046
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:58,785
and keep the peace,
according to our faith.

1047
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:01,721
Therefore, our leaving

1048
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:04,462
wouldn't be an act of cowardice

1049
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:05,725
or abandonment.

1050
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,813
Let's see you go.

1051
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,118
It wouldn't be because

1052
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:12,122
we were excommunicated
or exiled.

1053
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:15,038
It would be
a supreme act of faith...

1054
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:16,692
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1055
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:20,764
A step towards
love and forgiveness.

1056
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:28,554
Leaving is how
we demonstrate our faith.

1057
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:31,620
We are leaving because

1058
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:34,821
our faith is stronger
than the rules.

1059
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,392
Bigger than our life.

1060
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,449
[Mellow music fades]

1061
01:02:04,372 --> 01:02:06,679
I'm sorry.
But I think I might be dying.

1062
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:15,664
Mother, you're not dying.

1063
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:17,734
Your glasses need cleaning.

1064
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,737
[Laughing]

1065
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:25,524
Why are you laughing?

1066
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,919
We cannot leave.

1067
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:31,462
We...

1068
01:02:31,486 --> 01:02:34,248
It would be better
to stay and fight than leave.

1069
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:35,684
Do you really mean
that you want to stay

1070
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,991
and not fight?

1071
01:02:38,015 --> 01:02:39,949
Because when was the last time
you had the strength

1072
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,821
to stand up
to the aggression of klaas,

1073
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,431
to protect your children,

1074
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,520
- or to get out of harm's way?
- [Angrily] Who are you

1075
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:47,478
to tell me what kind of
wife and mother to be

1076
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:48,915
when you are
neither one yourself?

1077
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:51,700
You are a spinster. A whore!

1078
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,136
- An unwed mother!
- Stop.

1079
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,224
[Salome] Ona was
made unconscious

1080
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:55,399
and raped like the rest of us.

1081
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:57,837
How dare you call her a whore!

1082
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:59,882
Mariche, are you not afraid
that your own sweet boys

1083
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:01,275
will become monsters
like their father

1084
01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:02,798
because you do nothing
to protect them?

1085
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:04,234
- Stop it!
- Nothing to educate them,

1086
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:05,496
nothing to teach them

1087
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,802
the horror of
their father's ways...

1088
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:10,153
[Agata] I have heard enough!

1089
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:13,591
Do you women realize
we are talking about leaving?

1090
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:17,030
We are a large group.
Many things could go wrong.

1091
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,248
And time is fleeting.

1092
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:20,207
For the love
of our lord Jesus Christ

1093
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:21,686
and precious savior,

1094
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,235
shut your pie holes, please!

1095
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:32,132
How dare you
pass judgment on me?

1096
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:34,003
It wasn't a judgment.
It was a question.

1097
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:35,072
[Scoffs]

1098
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:46,387
[Agata whispers]
Tell her you're sorry.

1099
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:52,282
I'm sorry.

1100
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:53,631
I'm sorry that
what I said hurt you.

1101
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:54,937
Oh, fuck it off!

1102
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:56,199
Sit down, mariche!

1103
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:57,592
It's "fuck off" I think.

1104
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:58,660
Shh!

1105
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:02,510
I am sorry.

1106
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,729
I'm saying sorry, not just
to leave the hurt behind,

1107
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:06,296
but because I feel truly

1108
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,670
that I should not have
said something harmful to you.

1109
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:11,693
And mariche, I'm sorry

1110
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:15,068
because you do not
need or deserve any more harm.

1111
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:18,985
Who are you?

1112
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:22,075
Who are any of you

1113
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,992
to pretend I have had a choice?

1114
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,033
I am also sorry, mariche.

1115
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:51,907
I didn't try to protect you
or your children from klaas.

1116
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:55,563
And what you say is true.
You had no choice.

1117
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:59,504
You forgave him,
again and again,

1118
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:01,898
as you were told to.

1119
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:07,120
As I told you to.

1120
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:10,515
I'm sorry.

1121
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:13,866
I'm sorry.

1122
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,436
[Tearfully] I'm sorry.

1123
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:34,365
[Breathes shakily]

1124
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:40,260
It's not only the men and boys

1125
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:42,503
who have been
excellent students.

1126
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:49,902
[Sighs]

1127
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:58,495
[Agata] I think mariche,
we are all very sorry.

1128
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:01,150
What you were required
to endure was a...

1129
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:03,979
Misuse of forgiveness.

1130
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,720
Is there such a thing?

1131
01:06:05,744 --> 01:06:08,027
A forgiveness that is not good?

1132
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:10,855
Perhaps forgiveness
can in some instances

1133
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:13,795
be confused with permission.

1134
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:35,252
[Sobbing quietly]

1135
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:42,302
[Sobbing]

1136
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:48,917
[Footsteps approaching]

1137
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:51,896
[Greta] What in heaven's name?

1138
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,855
[Boy whimpers]

1139
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,620
What is it? Julius, what is it?

1140
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:00,993
Nettie, please.
Make an exception

1141
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,453
and tell us what is happening.

1142
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,064
What has happened to him?

1143
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:08,174
[Agata] Nettie, be realistic.

1144
01:07:08,198 --> 01:07:10,002
Tell us what has happened
to Julius.

1145
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,505
Speak. Just this once.

1146
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:13,962
What's wrong, sweetheart?

1147
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:16,921
My nose.
There's a cherry up my nose.

1148
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:18,706
Okay, well, blow.

1149
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,187
- [Exhales]
- Harder. Again.

1150

[Exhales]

1151
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:24,799
[Mariche sighs in relief]

1152
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:26,018
There you go.

1153
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,913
We have no cherries
in the colony.

1154
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:30,065
[Eerie music playing]

1155
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,285
Klaas sometimes brings them
back from the city.

1156
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,548
Who gave you
the cherries, Julius?

1157
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:36,052
Papa.

1158
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:39,901
Why don't you...

1159
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,445
You go and play
with nettie, all right?

1160
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:50,259
[Greta] Have we made a decision?

1161
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:51,719
Are we leaving?

1162
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:54,722
Yes.

1163
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:56,831
We are leaving because...

1164
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:58,093
We know why we are leaving.

1165
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:00,076
We are leaving
because we cannot stay.

1166
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:05,144
Hmm.

1167
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:06,667
We will take young boys of 12
with us.

1168
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,408
Allow the men
to join the women later

1169
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:10,216
under certain conditions.

1170
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:12,368
- No.
- No.

1171
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:14,066
Aaron. I know.

1172
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,198
Aaron is just over 12.
Just barely.

1173
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:18,505
Why would boys
of 13 and 14 be left behind?

1174
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:19,680
Why wouldn't they leave with us?

1175
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:21,160
Surely, we don't
have to be afraid

1176
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:22,509
of the boys of this age.

1177
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:23,988
August, you're
the boys' teacher.

1178
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:25,903
What is your feeling about this?

1179
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:27,122
Do boys of that age

1180
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,061
pose a risk
to our girls and women?

1181
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,304
Yes. Possibly.

1182
01:08:35,328 --> 01:08:37,437
Boys of 13 or 14 are capable

1183
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:40,290
of causing great damage
to girls and women.

1184
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:43,510
And to each other.

1185
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:47,403
It is a brash age.

1186
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:50,841
They are possessed
of reckless urges,

1187
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,495
physical exuberance,

1188
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:56,760
intense curiosity
that often results in injury.

1189
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:57,829
[Boys cheering]

1190
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,938
Unbridled emotion,

1191
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:04,159
including deep tenderness
and empathy,

1192
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,508
and not quite enough

1193
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:07,771
experience or brain development

1194
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:09,947
to fully understand
or appreciate

1195
01:09:09,971 --> 01:09:12,820
the consequences
of their words or actions.

1196
01:09:12,844 --> 01:09:14,367
They are like the yearlings.

1197
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,590
Young, awkward,
gleeful, powerful.

1198
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:22,743
They're tall, muscular,

1199
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:24,266
sexually inquisitive creatures,

1200
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,511
with little impulse control,
but they are children.

1201
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,388
They are children
and they can be taught.

1202
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:40,064
I'm a two-bit schoolteacher,

1203

a failed farmer,

1204
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:45,200
and above all a believer.

1205
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:48,116
And I believe
that with guidance,

1206
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,337
firm love and Patience,

1207
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:53,426
these boys are capable
of relearning

1208
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,582
their roles as males
in the colony.

1209
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:05,568

rules of early education.

01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:51,179

should be allowed

1222

to leave with the women...

1223
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:58,404
Providing the women
choose to leave.

1224

or no question.

[Agata] I have a proposal
to make.

1228
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:15,986
We have to protect
all of our children.

1229
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:17,727
Not only our daughters.

1230
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:20,252

1231
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,210
and the ones
who need special care

1232
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:24,473
must accompany the women.

1233

How do you mean must?

1234
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:27,171
What if they refuse?

1235
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:28,390
What if they
don't want to leave?

1236
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:31,480
We can't carry teenagers
on our backs.

1237
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,917
We will try
to influence our sons.

1238
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:35,354
But we cannot force them,

1239
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:37,356
and they might refuse,
it's true.

1240
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,598
August...

1241
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:44,300

the boys who remain?

Of course.

to realize that everything
that ever mattered to you

1291

in a few short hours.

1292

You and the women

to navigate.

into a fist...

Align the first knuckle
with the axis of the cross.

1317

And then the tip
of your thumb here

1318
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:58,048
will indicate south.

We will have
a lesson in navigation.

I could teach you

You make a fist
with your right hand.

1331

And point your two knuckles
to the southern cross.

1332

celestial navigation.

is pointing that's south.

one last time in the hayloft,

would have told you,

into the house late,

1352

and then he went to the barn

1353

and found we had
taken the horses.

[Salome] Mariche, did you
tell him what we are planning?

1355
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,699
She did. But only because
he wouldn't stop hitting me

to distract him.

he believed me.

I don't think he'll remember.
