1
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,785
Mommy and Daddy will
be right next to you.

2
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,419
The lights will go down.

3
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,122
There may be some organ
music as the curtain opens.

4
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,323
Don't be scared.

5
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,292
It'll be dark in
there, you said.

6
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,394
- I don't want to go in.
- But it's fun.

7
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,162
All week, you've
been so excited.

8
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,831
Your first ever movie.

9
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,466
- And the people are gigantic.
- What people?

10
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,136
You said the people in
the movie are gigantic.

11
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,805
Oh, because of the
big screen they're on,

12
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,640
but they're not real, uh, right?

13
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:15,710
- They're like dreams.
- Dreams are scary.

14
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,279
Some dreams are, but this
is gonna be a nice dream.

15
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,650
About a circus and clowns
and acrobats and, um...

16
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,251
You want to know how it works?

17
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,286
There's a big machine
called a projector.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,121
Inside, there's a
big bright light,

19
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,557
and it projects photographs

20
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,693
- of-of clowns and acrobats.
- And elephants.

21
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,294
-Uh, "projecting" means it sends them out.
-Happy things.

22
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,496
Happy things like light
from a huge flashlight.

23
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,567
But these photographs move
past the light really fast.

24
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,468
24 photos in every second.

25
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,604
Now, in your brain,

26
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:45,472
each photograph stays for
about a 15th of a second.

27
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,141
That's called
persistence of vision.

28
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,611
The photographs move past

29
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,478
faster than your brain
can let go of them,

30
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,480
and that's how the movie
projector tricks us

31
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,818
into believing that motionless
pictures are moving.

32
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,520
A motion picture.

33
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:03,825
Movies are dreams, doll,
that you never forget.

34
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,158
You just wait and see.

35
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,493
When it's over,
you're gonna have

36
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,495
the biggest, sloppiest
smile on your face.

37
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,497
They're letting us in.

38
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,781
Wait till the engines pass.

39
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,363
Unlock the door.

40
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,835
Pass it down.

41
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,940
- What's that?
- Second section.

42
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,812
Angel. She's on that train.

43
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,947
So what? We got the dough.
Let's get out of here.

44
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,416
Lights. I must turn the
lights down the track.

45
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,251
You crazy lunkhead.
Give me that wheel.

46
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,854
We are going to...
Down the track!

47
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,526
The train! Stop the train!

48
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,960
Stop the train!

49
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,964
Stop! Can't you see the lights?!

50
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,432
Stop!

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,969
First section! Hold it!

52
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:25,606
Angel! Angel!

53
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,363
What was your favorite part?

54
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,270
Sammy, what do you
want for Hanukkah?

55
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,540
I told you this
wasn't a good idea,

56
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,442
what with all of his
A-N-X-I-E-T-I-E-S.

57
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,512
Kids his age have big
I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N-S.

58
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,482
No fair spelling
out the long words.

59
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,063
The lights change
how everything looks.

60
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,555
It's hard to find our house.

61
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,991
Ours is the dark
house with no lights.

62
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,937
That's what I want for Hanukkah.

63
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,906
- What?
- Christmas lights!

64
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,776
Sorry, dolly.

65
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,878
Jews don't get Christmas lights.

66
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,780
Eight nights of candlelight.

67
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:42,382
♪ Who could ask for
anything more? ♪

68
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,887
♪ Who could ask for
anything more? ♪

69
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,791
Can I sleep with
the oscilloscope?

70
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,573
<i>Get going. We got
to burn rubber.</i>

71
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,941
<i>- What's that?
- Second section.</i>

72
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,509
<i>Angel. She's on that train.</i>

73
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:10,011
<i>The lights.</i>

74
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,488
<i>I must turn the
lights down the track.</i>

75
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,680
<i>Stop the train!</i>

76
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,681
<i>Stop the train!</i>

77
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,683
<i>-Angel!</i>

78
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:21,421
Mommy! Mommy!

79
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,026
I know what I want for Hanukkah!

80
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,094
I know what I want for Hanukkah!

81
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,141
Hanukkah!

82
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,845
Thank you!

83
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,916
Sammy.

84
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,985
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

85
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,887
I'm so excited.

86
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,830

00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:06,767

96
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,595
Okay, so the outside grounds,
the middle conducts the power,

97
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,898
and these two metal
wheels under the engine

98
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:38,532
complete the circuit.

99
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,802
So, new, Mr. Engineer?

100
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:44,138
RCA gave you a raise?

101
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,841
That is one expensive
trolley car.

102
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,743
It's not a trolley car.
It's a Lionel train.

103
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,878
No raises for the
computer guys this year.

104
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,046
Next year, maybe.

105
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,490
Your moonlighting
son is paying for it

106
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,816
by filling up my
house with broken TVs.

107
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,185
Repair work, that's how.

108
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:01,155
Oy, careful he doesn't
electrocute himself.

109
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,059
- Hold on.
- You're okay.

110
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,728
You're not taking that fancy
train to Florida without me.

111
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,462
Hey, look.

112
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,565
She's down on the floor.

113
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,567
Who's gonna help her up?

114
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,202
Who says I'm getting up?

115
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,873
I'm going to Miami
on the Sammy Limited.

116
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,841
Go ahead.

117
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,945
Ooh.

118
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,547
I precisely engineer toys.

119
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,915
You can play with them

120
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,259
when you've learned to
treat them with respect.

121
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,652
I do respect them. I love them.

122
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,330
I know you do, but you
can't just love something.

123
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,124
You also have to take
care of it, right?

124
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,531
Maybe we can play together
with them this weekend.

125
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,008
But I need to see them crash.

126
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,180
I don't understand.

127
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,816
Why does he need
to see them crash?

128
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,188
It's late.

129
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,856
You don't want to
shut your light?

130
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,957
Mm. In a minute.

131
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,326
I'm still wide-awake.

132
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,063
You see these descending notes?

133
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,632
That's called a lament bass.

134
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:30,071
You should play it on the
radio on that arts program.

135
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,106
-Oh.
-They keep asking you to go back.

136
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,808
I don't have time for that. Mm.

137
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,709
Well, we can hire a sitter.

138
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,953
Who can afford that? Forget it.

139
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,080
That was another life.

140
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,582
That was two kids ago.

141
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,890
You know what I miss
most about the piano?

142
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,895
Surrendering to the score.

143
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,366
Knowing Bach is
gonna tell you how...

144
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,902
First this note,
then this chord,

145
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:06,373
then you open your hand, you
stretch down an octave...

146
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,987
Making a little world you
can be safe and happy in.

147
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,229
Thank you.

148
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,641
That's why he needs
to watch them crash.

149
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:46,080
He's trying to get some
kind of control over it.

150
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,255
Sammy?

151
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,893
We're going to use
Daddy's camera to film it.

152
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,095
Only crash the train once, okay?

153
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,897
Then, after we get
the film developed,

154
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,307
you can watch it
crash over and over

155
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,767
till it's not so scary anymore.

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,270
And your real train
won't ever get broken.

157
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,208
One more thing, dolly.

158
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,911
Let's not tell your father.

159
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:20,247
It'll be our secret movie,
just yours and mine.

160
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:24,251
- Okay?
- Okay.

161
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,487
Sorry I'm late.

162
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,722
I picked up Ms.
Moynahan's Motorola.

163
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,167
There's no room left
in the workshop.

164
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,202
- Where should I put it?
- The living room, I guess?

165
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,061
Okay.

166
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,131
Hey, uh, sorry I'm late.
I picked up Mrs. Fabelman.

167
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,165
Where should I put her?

168
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,403
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

169
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,738
- Did the mail come?
- It's on the table.

170
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,776
Cossack.

171
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,862
- This is brisket?
- My movie!

172
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,466
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

173
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,134
After supper.

174
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,037
The amount of magnetism
is increased by

175
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,240
how magnetically permeable
the core material is.

176
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,809
The tricky thing is how
permeable we can make it.

177
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,178
Am I supposed to be
following any of this?

178
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,814
You know what a magnetic
field is, right?

179
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,850
Uh, yeah. Well,
sure. I mean, it...

180
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,019
Sammy, do you know what
a magnetic field is?

181
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,821
- Can I be excused?
- Nope.

182
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,523
But I need to,
just for a minute.

183
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,258
- What's so urgent?
- Honey.

184
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,093
This tastes funny, Burt.

185
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,462
It tastes funny
on a plastic fork.

186
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,398
- Ma.
- Is she saving the silverware

187
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,534
for when the
Eisenhowers drop by?

188
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,402
The problem is we're
using vacuum tubes,

189
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,137
not transistors,
and magnetic cores

190
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,007
- to try to access memory...
- 35,000 magnetic cores.

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,842
Hey, Sam, you know on
your father's camera

192
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,043
when the film runs out?

193
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,545
When that happens,
what do you do?

194
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,413
- Load more film.
- The same with computers.

195
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,559
You have to load more tape, and
that slows everything down...

196
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,284
Mitz, the chopped liver
was beyond belief.

197
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,085
Load it with data,

198
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,221
and instead of changing
tapes every ten seconds,

199
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,989
this new machine
he's engineering...

200
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:11,425
- The BIZMAC!
- The BIZMAC!

201
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,427
It can search for information

202
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,605
through all these tapes at once.

203
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,039
You never need to
change any of them.

204
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,103
It'll be ten times faster.

205
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,100
I love Burt's brain.

206
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,270
Especially when you're around
to explain what's in it.

207
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:28,942
Mom, I have to go upstairs now.

208
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,512
Not until you've
finished eating.

209
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:31,579
He cleaned his plate.

210
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,180
No, he didn't.

211
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,050
Sammy.

212
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,861
Hey, Natalie, I think there's
something under your plate.

213
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:38,986
- Sammy.
- No, there isn't.

214
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,120
Lift it up and check.

215
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,322
I saw it moving.

216
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,231
Licorice.

217
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,867
If there's anything
I'm a sucker for,

218
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:54,901
it's licorice.

219
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,940
Uncle Bennie, that
was so disgusting!

220
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,010
- No, no!
- Natalie, he is not your uncle.

221
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,346
Also, he is not that funny.

222
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,482
Oh, "uncle" is a
term of affection.

223
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,151
Natalie, he's not related.

224
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:16,090
He's only always here
because he works for my son.

225
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,026
He's only always here
because he's my best friend.

226
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,228
And deep down inside
you, Mrs. Fabelman,

227
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,297
admit it, I'm your friend, too.

228
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,234
Deep down inside of me
is none of your business.

229
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,104
Sid Caesar's on tonight.

230
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,005
Help me.

231
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,375
- Natalie, get that corner.
- What?

232
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,677
Get the corner. Get the corner.

233
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,512
Can I help you take it out?

234
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,199
Sammy.

235
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,307
I had to crash it a
whole lot of times,

236
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,410
- but the train never got hurt.
- Golly.

237
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,715
I thought that was <i>The
Greatest Show on Earth.</i>

238
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:52,486
Oh, more, more,
more, more, more.

239
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,456
Head back. Open.

240
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:58,091
- Ah.
- Candy corn in.

241
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,427
Say, "Ah."

242
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,162
Head back.

243
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,033
Ketchup. Okay.

244
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,367
Scream like it hurts.

245
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,002
Pull it!

246
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,652
Sammy!

247
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,255
Oh.

248
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,629
Take off the blindfolds.

249
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,607
Sammy?

250
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:23,277
Reggie, Natalie, come
downstairs pronto.

251
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,446
Your father has an announcement.

252
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,818
General Electric
wants to hire me

253
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:33,353
because of what I did on BIZMAC.

254
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,558
They want to use my electronic
library system to...

255
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,560
Well, I-I don't think
they have any notion

256
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,794
of what I can do with it.

257
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,129
And I'll make more money.

258
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,164
Is Uncle Bennie coming, too?

259
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,501
Well, D-Daddy and me haven't
had a chance to think

260
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,336
- about Uncle Bennie, but...
- Bennie, no. He lives here.

261
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,407
Burt.

262
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,712
I'll miss your
Uncle Bennie, too,

263
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:00,480
but Phoenix is a real neat city.

264
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:02,182
It's on the rise.

265
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,360
They've only just hired me.
I've got no pull there yet.

266
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,253
I can't ask General Electric

267
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,855
to hire somebody
else on my say-so.

268
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,857
- That's not how it works.
- Don't ask them.

269
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,726
Do it yourself. They're
hiring you to manage.

270
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,795
Managers hire. Hire Bennie.

271
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:15,530
Uh, who's watching... Sammy!

272
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,464
He's got to make a name
for himself at RCA.

273
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,266
- Come here. Come here.
- That's what I did.

274
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,535
He'll stay in New Jersey,

275
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,436
get out from under
my shadow and then...

276
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,147
- He needs you, Burt.
- There's a tornado outside!

277
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,649
Yeah, well, there's
a bigger one in here.

278
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,610
Honestly, honestly, Burt,
sometimes I want to shake you.

279
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,478
You're-you're gonna leave him
behind with just a-a shrug?

280
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,146
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

281
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,649
"We'll see ya later."

282
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:37,518
And once we're gone, who will
he have left in New Jersey?

283
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:39,395
You have an opportunity
to help your best friend.

284
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,855
- Mommy, look!
- Mommy! Mommy!

285
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,322
- Honestly, wake up.
- Mom! Mom!

286
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,759
-What?!
-Look! There's a tornado outside.

287
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,527
- I'm scared.
- Just go.

288
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:51,766
Wow! Ah!

289
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,303
Oh!

290
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,142
You weren't kidding!

291
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,412
How close is it?

292
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,917
Why does the sky look orange?

293
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:12,787
Come on!

294
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,555
Come on. Let's go see.

295
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,660
- Get in, get in!
- Get in!

296
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:21,629
Mitz? Where are you going?

297
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,932
Mitz, where are...

298
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,669
Hey!

299
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,771
Where are you going?

300
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,808
Mitz!

301
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,378
Mitzi!

302
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,687
<i>Where is it?</i>

303
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,287
I can't see it anymore.

304
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,956
Up ahead somewhere.
We'll find it.

305
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,726
Mom, it's there. It's there!

306
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,899
Is this s-safe?

307
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:00,668
Of course it's safe.
I'm your mother.

308
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,872
Mom, stop!

309
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,364
Everything happens for a reason.

310
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,468
Everything happens for a reason.

311
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:37,404
Everything happens for a reason.

312
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,007
Say it with me.

313
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,510
Everything happens for a reason.

314
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:46,013
Everything happens for a reason.

315
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:48,883

00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,593
- Sal found babies.
- Look at that.

353
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:39,861
Sammy, Dean, come on.

354
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,461
There's a huge nest right there.

355
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,164
- Come on, guys.
- A big one, Sammy.

356
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,099
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

357
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,534
It's a whole herd of 'em.

358
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,735
Scorpions come in nests.

359
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,469
No, actually, it's
a bed of scorpions.

360
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,739
No, it's a nest.

361
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,875
The baby scorpions are
called "scorplings."

362
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,076
They're twice as venomous.

363
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,452
That's-that's why
the lab pays more.

364
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,879
There's got to be
like 50 of 'em.

365
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,056
Well, how much is the
laboratory gonna pay for them?

366
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,615
50 cents per baby.

367
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,984
- That's 25 bucks!
- We're rich.

368
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,418
Well, what are we gonna buy?

369
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:08,990
12 dollars even.

370
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:13,060
Well, it's the merit badge
for photography, not movies.

371
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:15,663
The manual says you got to tell
a story with still pictures.

372
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,565
Yeah, but all a movie
is is still pictures.

373
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:19,475
You just put a bunch of
them together and they move.

374
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,036
Okay, but what kind of
movie are we making?

375
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,772
Ooh. Sammy, look.
It's Janet Benedict.

376
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,777
Hey, go on and talk
to her. I dare you.

377
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,145
He already talked to her.

378
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:32,813
- No way.
- Like hell.

379
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,782
No way. He actually
spoke to her?

380
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,918
He did. He did. He
walked right up to her.

381
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,495
- And he...
- You went up to Janet Benedict?

382
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,830
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

383
00:23:39,854 --> 00:23:41,565
Oh, come on. Tell them
what happened, Sammy.

384
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,924
Nothing happened.

385
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:45,192
Something happened. Come on.

386
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,728
Could be the same one.

387
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,799
"Overland." Say, I think
it is the same one.

388
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,434
Well, I declare.

389
00:23:58,005 --> 00:23:59,540
So, uh,

390
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:02,677
Sammy kind of sidewinds
his way in her direction.

391
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,879
And he's trying to, um...
he-he's trying to work up

392
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:07,548
the nerve to say something
slick and smooth like,

393
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,482
- "Hey, Jan, baby."
- No, I wasn't.

394
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:10,952
You're making this up.

395
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:13,486
But-but he sees that Janet's
got something on her nose.

396
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:14,722
So now he's thinking, "Cool.

397
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,624
Here's my excuse to go
up and talk to her."

398
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,760
So he goes and he says,
"Hey, uh, sorry, Janet.

399
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:22,163
It-it looks like you have a
little smudge on your nose."

400
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:23,864
- Shut up, Hark.
- But it wasn't a smudge.

401
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,842
- It looked like a smudge.
- And it wasn't little.

402
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,535
Hark, shut up!

403
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:30,204
It was a booger!

404
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:31,772
A big, fat,

405
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,808
Janet Benedict booger.

406
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,746
It was huge.

407
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:44,685
Hey, Sammy.

408
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,554
Stand and deliver.

409
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,090
What kind of movie
are we gonna make?

410
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:53,060
Stand and deliver.

411
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,731
No, keep screaming.
Keep screaming.

412
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,012
I need more dust. Dad, can
you grab the sandwich board?

413
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:04,638
No, no. God, no,
no more dust. No.

414
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:06,073
Reggie, stop coughing!

415
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,975
-I'm coughing because there's dust.
-Okay.

416
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,753
-More dust, fellas.
-Natalie, say, "Please don't kill me."

417
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:10,921
- All right.
- Reggie, stop coughing.

418
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,613
You're being dramatic.

419
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:13,890
Mr. Fabelman, you're getting
dirt inside my stagecoach.

420
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,716
Don't you want me
to be dramatic?

421
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,160
- Don't look into the camera.
- Well, we'll clean it out.

422
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,586
Guys, stop looking
into the camera.

423
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,154
- I can't use any of this.
- Dad!

424
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,973
Fake.

425
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,610
Totally fake.

426
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,062
You hear it?

427
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,997
She has got to cut those
goddamn fingernails

428
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,832
before she goes on
live television.

429
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,301
I have to perform this tomorrow.

430
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:16,303
It's a difficult piece.

431
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:18,038
It's a very big deal for me.

432
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:20,407
All I asked was for you to
keep your big traps shut

433
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,244
and listen to my
dress rehearsal.

434
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:24,778
Sorry, Mitz. It's wonderful.

435
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,147
You hear how the
rising arpeggios

436
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,882
lift up the sad notes?

437
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:30,284
It's in F minor, but your
mom makes it sound so alive.

438
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,319
She makes it sound like
she's playing a typewriter.

439
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,222
Oh, no.

440
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,690
Not this again.

441
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,731
Do you hear it? Am I clicking?

442
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:46,100
I concentrate on
your playing, but...

443
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,434
Bu... Oh, great. But what?

444
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,936
But people can
hear it in Tucson.

445
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,046
Maybe I've gotten used to it.

446
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,704
Maybe GE should make

447
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,173
rubber tips for fingernails.

448
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,441
All right, Mitzi Fabelman.

449
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:56,310
Time to face the music.

450
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,878
Oh, boy.

451
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,480
You stay away from
me with those things.

452
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:01,182
- It's Beethoven, damn it.
- No, no, no!

453
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:02,893
- It is not Morse code. Come on.
- No! Stop! Stop! Stop it!

454
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,451
He has a point,
though, especially with

455
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:06,020
the polydirectional
ribbon microphones

456
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,333
they have on television stage...

457
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,292
Come on. You married her.

458
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:12,760
Dad, don't.

459
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:14,070
Do it. Do it. Do
it. Do it. Do it!

460
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:15,863
I will scratch you.
Don't think I won't!

461
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:17,431
Do you think Arthur Rubinstein

462
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,933
had fingernails?

463
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,410
- Horowitz? Schnabel?
- Do not think about it.

464
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:21,936
- Kempff?
- No, no, no.

465
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,505
- Liberace.
- No, no, no, no.

466
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:24,881
- Not my nails.
- Come on, Fabelman.

467
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,149
Show her who's
General Electric's

468
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,851
- product design manager.
- No, my beautiful nails.

469
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,311
I paid a buck 50 at the
beauty parlor for these.

470
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:32,379
Oh, no.

471
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:36,850
One, two, three.

472
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,789
Get off of me, Delilah.

473
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,224
- Delilah?
- Okay, the fun's over.

474
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,459
I'll do the rest myself.

475
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,300
Oh.

476
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,768
Oh, great.

477
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:57,037
Just great. Well,
that decides it.

478
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,373
I'm gonna play the program
from memory tomorrow.

479
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:04,144
No sheet music, short nails,
like a real performing artist.

480
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,395
Did you drop your gun?

481
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:55,462
Come on.

482
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,375
That's me.

483
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:13,881
Real scary, Sheriff.

484
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:25,259
Whoa.

485
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,107
Whoa.

486
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:45,979
H-How'd you do that?

487
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,284
How'd you do that?

488
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:10,538
Whoa!

489
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:23,384
Go, Sammy!

490
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,623
It's kind of like
what I do, isn't it,

491
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:30,991
what a movie director does?

492
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,259
- It is?
- I figure out

493
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,128
what my division
needs to accomplish,

494
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:37,398
then I work out how my
guys are gonna get it done.

495
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:40,434
Yeah, it is. Yeah, sort of.

496
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,270
How'd you make it look like
the guns were really firing?

497
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,274
I did it with pins.

498
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,676
Pins.

499
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,011
Yeah, I poked holes
in the film with pins.

500
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,580
- Sammy.
- Yeah.

501
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,214
Thinking like an engineer.

502
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:56,150
Watch the road, Dad.

503
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,687
Sammy, watch the road.

504
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:01,164
I can't edit without
an editing machine.

505
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,591
I have to be able to
cut and splice, and I...

506
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,093
Let's revisit it after
the camping trip.

507
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,328
It's three hours to
the national forest.

508
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:11,465
If you get your license, you
can help with the driving.

509
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:13,033
Okay.

510
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,504
"You are approaching
a railroad crossing

511
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,706
"with no warning devices
and limited visibility.

512
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,274
The speed limit is..."

513
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:21,752
See, the thing is, though,
about my new movie,

514
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,678
is that it's just...

515
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:26,313
It's about World
War II, your war.

516
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:27,725
It's gonna be, like,
out of this world.

517
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,116
I'm shooting on a Bolex H8.

518
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,494
Finally, I can use
double run film.

519
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:31,686
You know, that's six minutes

520
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,187
without having to
change the reel.

521
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,255
How much did you spend
to rent this camera?

522
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,158
20 bucks. But I
used my own money.

523
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,594
You don't have to...

524
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,763
And this movie
editor gizmo costs?

525
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:44,264
It's a Mansfield eight
millimeter movie editor.

526
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,534
How much?

527
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:48,603
- 80 bucks.
- Doggone it, Sammy!

528
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:51,071
A hundred dollars for a hobby?

529
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:52,540
It's not a hobby, Dad.

530
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:54,417
If you spent half the time
on algebra that you spend on

531
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,386
- these movies, you could get...
- Algebra? I hate algebra.

532
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,245
Why are you...

533
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:00,080
It's completely pointless.

534
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:02,125
Not if you want to make
something, it's not pointless.

535
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,619
Gee, Sammy, when I was a
boy, I always used to think,

536
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:07,020
-"Somebody figured out how to make this."
-Yeah.

537
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:08,322
- This car...
- Uh-huh.

538
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,625
That rearview mirror,
that directional signal.

539
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,727
I want to make movies, though.

540
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,663
I mean something real.

541
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:18,165
Not imaginary.

542
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:22,537
Something someone
can actually use.

543
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:27,007
Like a driver's license.

544
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:30,143
I'm gonna vomit,
Sammy! I'm gonna vomit!

545
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,513
Sammy, please pull over.

546
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:33,146
She's gonna puke all over me.

547
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,517
Go slower. You are
the worst driver.

548
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,117
You're gonna break the car.

549
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,453
We're on a back road going
three miles per hour.

550
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:41,656
- Calm down.
- You're doing great, doll.

551
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,690
You're doing very well.

552
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:44,491
Okay, watch out.
Puddle up ahead.

553
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,468
So we've got three

554
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:56,379
that are strong and still green
inside, so they don't burn.

555
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:58,573
Bright green means that
they're still alive

556
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:00,407
and that they carry moisture.

557
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,745
And the reason that we use
the shape of the triangle

558
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:06,246
is that when these
three points connect,

559
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,816
if we find the center
of gravitational force,

560
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,251
it creates almost
perfect balance.

561
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,220
-Whew. Oh.
-Because I'm Tutti, and you're Frutti.

562
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,489
So who else are you
gonna listen to?

is not for industrial

Sixty... You are nuts.

00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,396
And time-sharing

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,331
They're gonna know this
is a business machine

612
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,702
we're building, and we're
all gonna get fired.

613
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,436
No.

614
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,270
Yes!

615
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:44,972
GE doesn't build
business computers.

616
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:46,440
We do heavy industry processing.

617
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:47,909
You got that straight
from the CEO.

618
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:49,544
Ralph Cordiner is
gonna skin you alive.

619
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:52,479
Once Bank of America buys
in, this will be profitable,

620
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:54,982
and that's Mr. Cordiner's
job, making money.

621
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,450
My job is getting Raytheon

622
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,986
to deliver 10,000
germanium transistors

623
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,454
that meet our
tolerance standards.

624
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,724
And your job is to get
the cabling diagrams

625
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,625
to Pitney Bowes so
when the time comes,

626
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,894
we have a sorter to hook
up to the mainframe.

627
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,395
Well, maybe Pitney
Bowes will hire me

628
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,472
after you get us
both canned from GE.

629
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:11,331
Isn't it worth getting canned

630
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,735
for the chance to build a
machine that can do all that?

631
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,268
It's worth it to you, maybe!

632
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:16,513
Sure as the Lord made
little green apples,

633
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:17,939
California, here you come.

634
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:19,439
IBM is waiting.

635
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:20,875
Are we moving to California?

636
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,375
- You are, any day now.
- No, no, no.

637
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,811
What?

638
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,489
IBM's asking, and that's
flattering, but...

639
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,048
- Flattering?
- Flattering!

640
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:28,926
Every guy in computer
would give his matzo balls

641
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,484
to get an offer.

642
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:31,886
You'll be in California

643
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,622
building double-precision
auxiliary units with an FP64.

644
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:37,024
I'm gonna be left
schvitzing in Arizona

645
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:38,802
- making 40-watt light bulbs.
- Hold your horses.

646
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,495
-Congruence? Come on.
-I told your mom it'll be up to her.

647
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,431
I'm not uprooting us
again unless she says yes.

648
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:49,737
Why would Mamaleh ever leave
all of this for California?

649
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:53,306
We have the Grand Canyon.

650
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,276
They have the San Andreas Fault.

651
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:58,880
Mamaleh says...

652
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:01,783
I will never leave Arizona,

653
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:04,018
and Arizona will never leave me.

654
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:10,423
Kids, avert your eyes.

655
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,411
- Hey, man.
- Hmm?

656
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:34,615
- Shouldn't you be filming this?
- Not enough light.

657
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:45,626
GE, living better electrically!

658
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,113
Mom?

659
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:09,349
Mom, everyone can see
through your dress. Um...

660
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:14,889
Reggie, get out of the way.

661
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:18,391
Dad, can you please stop this?

662
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,394
- Come. Sit.
- No.

663
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:27,034
Bennie, don't look!

664
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,604
Oh! You're all nuts!

665
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:29,697
My mama's such a good mama.

666
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,673
I love you so much.

667
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,614
I'm right here.

668
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,483
I'm right here with you.

669
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:52,553
I'm holding your hand.

670
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:54,221
Can you feel that, Mama?

671
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:55,957
I just gave you a squeeze.

672
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,560
I love you, Mama.

673
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:04,865
Ma.

674
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,902
Mommy?

675
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,106
She opened her eyes.

676
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,275
Nurse.

677
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,978
Mommy, I'm here.
Here. I'm right here.

678
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:19,080
I'm right here, Mama.

679
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,983
Mommy, look at me.

680
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:24,085
Mommy, can you hear?

681
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,856
Oh.

682
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:32,693
Oh, oh...

683
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:03,657
It's a Mansfield eight
millimeter movie editor.

684
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:05,893
That's what you wanted, right?

685
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,266
Oh, my God.

686
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:22,309
Uh, now I need a
favor in return.

687
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,851
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

688
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:32,286
Here's the favor.

689
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,088
Yeah.

690
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,096
I want you to make a
camping trip movie.

691
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:43,664
Uh, you can learn

692
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,075
how the editing machine
works while you do this.

693
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,243
It'll make your mom feel better.

694
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:47,968
Yeah.

695
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:51,972
That last night when she
danced in the headlights,

696
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:54,275
that'd be great.

697
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:56,710
Get to it tomorrow, okay?

698
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,716
Um, tomorrow's when
we start shooting.

699
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:06,320
<i>Escape to Nowhere.</i>

700
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:07,721
We're shooting all weekend, Dad.

701
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,723
- I can't.
- Shoot it next weekend.

702
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:15,362
We've got like 40 guys
coming to be in the movie.

703
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:18,065
I'll-I'll w-work on all the
camping trip stuff on Monday.

704
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,868
I'm asking you to do this
now for your mom. She's...

705
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:23,838
Yeah, and I said that I will,
just not tomorrow, please.

706
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:26,874
Don't be selfish. She
just lost her mother.

707
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,976
That's more important
than your hobby.

708
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,678
Dad, can you stop
calling it a hobby?

709
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,847
It'll cheer her
up, watching this.

710
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,891
- It's something we can do to...
- Her mom just died.

711
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,784
How is that gonna cheer her up?

712
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:39,620
Because you made it for her.

713
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:52,900
Uh, something's not right.

714
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:58,072
I don't know what else to do.

715
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:03,177
Can you help me?

716
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,297
Hello.

717
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,433
Mitzi. Mitzi.

718
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,173
Mama?

719
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:34,208
Somebody's coming.

720
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,076
Mama?

721
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:41,749
M-Mama. What...

722
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,818
- Mama. Mam...
- You mustn't let him in.

723
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:49,089
- You mustn't let him in.
- Mama, I-I can't hear you.

724
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,791
I am scared.

725
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:53,794
You mustn't let
him in the house.

726
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,095
Mama, please. I...

727
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:56,797
Do not let him in.

728
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,742
- Do not let him in the house.
- What? No, I can't...

729
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,334
Wh-Who's coming?

730
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,036
Don't open the door.

731
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:03,837
Mama.

732
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,274
Mommy, don't go.

733
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,210
Don't go yet.

734
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:15,282
You're having a bad dream.

735
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:37,137
This is a lot of food, Mom.

736
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,773
Well, I'm upset.

737
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,942
Oh, my God. That crazy dream.

738
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:44,111
I can't get it out of my head.

739
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:47,948
Uh, last night, I dreamed
I got a call from my mama.

740
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:50,117
And she wanted to warn me.

741
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,886
- That's silly. Grandma died.
- About what?

742
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,188
Well, something's coming.

743
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,156
She wants me to batten
down the hatches.

744
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,459
We're never going to be
able to eat all of this.

745
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:05,099
Who is that?

746
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,345
It's Uncle Boris.

747
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:19,346
Hmm?

748
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,148
Uncle who?

749
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:24,051
Mom?

750
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:28,822
That's who she meant!

751
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:33,294
My... That's my-my
mama's brother!

752
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:43,203
Oh, he scared the crap out
of her when they were kids!

753
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:54,114
Don't let him in!

754
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,019
You were in the circus?

755
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:00,622
Mama said you were
the lion tamer.

756
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:02,256
No, not at first.

757
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:06,260
At first, it was, "Podgorny,
pound in the tent pegs.

758
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:09,263
Podgorny, muck out
the pachyderms."

759
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:12,933
And then, one night,
the big cat act,

760
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:15,469
he comes down with the
flu bug, so it was, uh,

761
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:17,905
"Boris Podgorny,
in with the lions."

762
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,440
He's lying, right?

763
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:22,577
- No, he's telling you a story.
- Know what it's like, huh?

764
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,612
Pain in the ass, sisters.

765
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,481
- That's rude.
- He said "ass"!

766
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:28,982
I know.

767
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:32,252
But when did you start
working in the movies?

768
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,221
1927.

769
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:35,657
1927... that was
<i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

770
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,100
That's the year that
talkies started.

771
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,926
Yeah, sure, talkies. But me, no.

772
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,362
I started with, um,
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>

773
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:43,097
Not a talkie.

774
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,499
It was Harry Pollard.

775
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,167
He acted for Selig Polyscope.

776
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,104
He, uh, married Maggie
what's-her-name.

777
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:52,239
- Mm-hmm.
- He directed <i>Uncle Tom.</i>

778
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:53,675
Lift up your plate.

779
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,111
So, Pollard needed help
with the bloodhounds.

780
00:47:57,144 --> 00:48:00,515
So, my pal Fleischaker was
a big name in dog acts.

781
00:48:00,548 --> 00:48:02,082
Poodles, mainly.

782
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:05,285
But, "Sure," Fleischaker
says to Pollard.

783
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,988
"Yeah. Bloodhounds, poodles,
what's the difference?"

784
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:09,390
Ooh.

785
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:11,158
So, he went.

786
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:15,095
But, uh, by this
time, uh, Fleischaker,

787
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:17,264
he had it up to here
with the Jew-haters.

788
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:20,934
There was a lot of that
kind in the circuses.

789
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,936
Not many Jews,
lots of Jew-haters.

790
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,572
- Right.
- But the movies...

791
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:27,107
Oy vavoy!

792
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,076
Fleischaker writes to
me, "Boris," he writes.

793
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:31,412
"Boris," he writes,

794
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:33,581
"Hollywood is heimish, heimishe.

795
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:37,484
I'm in a minyan with Douglas
Fairbanks and Ricardo Cortez."

796
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:38,529
- Whoa.
- "Come to Hollywood."

797
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,020
So, I went.

798
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:45,225
Your wife, she don't
like doing the dishes?

799
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,695
Uh, piano hands.

800
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:50,197
Ah, fershteyn.

801
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:55,302
So, you like the movies,
huh, Mr. Pitselshas?

802
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:58,305
Okay, so the sergeant, he
comes over the hill here,

803
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:02,075
and I'm gonna go below him,
so we see him and the sky.

804
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,678
And so we don't
see what he sees,

805
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:05,412
but we do see that
he's really...

806
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,290
Okay, so he's, like, almost
losing his mind, right?

807
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,426
-Mm-hmm.
-'Cause what he is seeing is totally terrible.

808
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,319
And then, I'm gonna turn the
camera so that we see it.

809
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:15,022
It's just in another
notebook. Hang on.

810
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:17,157
If that's the movie, uh...

811
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:19,627
you could show me instead
of describing me to death.

812
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,663
No, that's just our
stupid camping trip.

813
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:23,263
My dad's...

814
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,365
He wants me to put this
camping film together

815
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:26,467
so it'll cheer up Mom.

816
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:29,604
Because her heart is broken.

817
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:31,539
Because her mama iz toyt.

818
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:35,175
But you, Mr. Director,
you don't want to do this,

819
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,477
what your daddy tells you,

820
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,746
because you want to make
your war picture, huh?

821
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,114
Yeah, yeah.

822
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,217
Believe me, Sammy boy, I get it.

823
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,620
Family, art.

824
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,255
It'll tear you in two.

825
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:52,993
You hear that?

826
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:55,205
Oh, yeah. My mom's
practicing. She's always...

827
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,431
Sha. You talk too much. Listen.

828
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:07,074
When she was a kid, already
she played like that.

829
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,813
She should have been a
concert piano player.

830
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:15,015
Little Rubinstein, she was.

831
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,785
She could have played...

832
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:21,388
You name it, she could
have played there.

833
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,257
And she...

834
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:27,394
Once, I visited her and Tina
and Menashe in Cincinnati,

835
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:31,666
and she says to me she wants
to be a great piano artist.

836
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,467
But she didn't do it.

837
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,403
Yeah, she's really good.
You know, she played on TV.

838
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:38,071
TV? Feh!

839
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:41,375
She could have played at
Musikverein in Vienna.

840
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,679
You see, what she
got in her heart

841
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,548
is what you got, what I got.

842
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:47,615
Art.

843
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:52,152
Like me. Like you, I think.

844
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:55,723
We're junkies, and
art is our drug.

845
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:57,357
Family, we love.

846
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,695
But art, we're meshuga for art.

847
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:03,463
You think I wanted to leave my
sisters, my mama and my papa,

848
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:06,668
and go stick my stupid
head in the mouth of lions?

849
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:09,771
Put-Putting your head in-in
a lion's mouth is art?

850
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:17,444
No. Sticking your head in the
mouths of lions was balls.

851
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:22,215
Making sure the lion don't
eat my head, that is art.

852
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:26,788
You see, Tini, she
didn't say to Mitzi,

853
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,656
"Go do what you gotta."

854
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,694
I mean, she was a good person,
my sister, but she was scared.

855
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:34,294
Scared for your mother.

856
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:36,229
-She should have safety in the family.
-Uh...

857
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:38,432
So Mitzi, she gave it all up.

858
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:40,902
Ow! Wh...

859
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:43,337
I want you should
remember how that hurt.

860
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,841
Because when they say all this,
when they say, "What you do?

861
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:49,309
"Oh, that's cute. It's a hobby.

862
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:51,211
It's like stamps or
butterfly collecting,"

863
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:53,213
you feel your face,
how it feels now.

864
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:54,424
Yeah, you almost pulled it off.

865
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,726
So you remember your Uncle Boris

866
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,351
and what he's telling you.

867
00:51:57,384 --> 00:51:59,754
Because you're going to
join the circus, I can tell.

868
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:01,355
You can't hardly wait.

869
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:02,890
You want to be in the big top.

870
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:05,325
You'll shovel elephant
shit until they say,

871
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,161
"Okay, Sammy, now ride
the goddamn elephant."

872
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:09,664
Oh, you love those people, huh?

873
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:12,700
Your sisters, your mama,
your papa. Except...

874
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:15,837
Except this.

875
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,605
This, I think you
love a little more.

876
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:18,773
No, I don't.

877
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,808
Yeah.

878
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:22,944
Oh, hey. Run all
you want, boychick,

879
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:25,379
but you know I ain't
whistling Dixie here.

880
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:29,383
You'll make your movies,
and you will do your art.

881
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:32,654
And you'll remember how it hurt.

882
00:52:32,687 --> 00:52:34,856
So you know what I'm saying?

883
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:38,492
Art will give you crowns in
heaven and laurels on earth.

884
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,360
But...

885
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:44,498
it'll tear your heart
out and leave you lonely.

886
00:52:44,532 --> 00:52:46,934
You'll be a shanda
for your loved ones.

887
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:48,970
An exile in the desert.

888
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:50,738
A gypsy.

889
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,775
Art is no game.

890
00:52:53,808 --> 00:52:55,610
Art is dangerous
as a lion's mouth.

891
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:57,277
It'll bite your head off.

892
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:00,715
Look at me.

893
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:04,552
Look at me.

894
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:08,556
Is it a wonder that Tini, she
wanted nothing to do with me?

895
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:10,792
With me, with...

896
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:12,994
Oh, Tini.

897
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:17,197
Oh, Tini! Oh, Tini.

898
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,433
I...

899
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,606
Stop, stop! Stop it!

900
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,276
What, you never saw
nobody grieving before?

901
00:53:33,648 --> 00:53:36,349
Let's go to sleep, bubbala.

902
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:45,960
Uh, you can sleep in the
bed. I have my sleeping bag.

903
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:47,628
I'm sitting shiva for my sister.

904
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:48,930
I sleep on the floor.

905
00:53:48,963 --> 00:53:50,497
Y-You want to sleep
on the floor, too?

906
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:52,900
She was your grandma.

907
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:55,870
Tear your clothes.
Sleep on the floor.

908
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,271
Good night.

909
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,755
- Say "bye-bye."
- Bye-bye.

910
00:54:13,788 --> 00:54:15,022
Bye-bye.

911
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:02,103
I don't know what Mama
was so worried about.

912
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:05,573
It was a nice visit.

913
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:04,165
Yuck.

914
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,242
Whoa!

915
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:17,745
Oh!

916
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:25,186
Aw.

917
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:31,058
This is the life.

918
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:44,738
Only you can prevent
forest fires.

919
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:14,268
Mm.

920
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:27,214
Oh.

921
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:33,921
It's so beautiful,
what you made, dolly.

922
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:37,091
You really see me.

923
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:46,133
Hey, man. How about that, huh?

924
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:49,103
Hey, Sammy, that was real neat.

925
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:54,808
Die, <i>Amerikaner!</i>

926
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:58,946
Move! Move! Fall backwards!

927
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:04,885
Whoa!

928
01:03:05,486 --> 01:03:06,887
<i>Attacke!</i>

929
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:10,924
Ah! Cover!

930
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:20,067
Krauts, they're everywhere!

931
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:23,337
There's too many of them!

932
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:48,195
Turn.

933
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:49,229
Cut!

934
01:03:49,263 --> 01:03:52,099
Great. Now, um...

935
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,035
Okay, come here. Come here.

936
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:57,905
Um, you're standing
here a minute,

937
01:03:57,938 --> 01:03:59,907
looking down at
what just happened.

938
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,042
- A whole minute?
- I'll give you a signal

939
01:04:02,076 --> 01:04:03,654
when I want you to start to
move, okay? So you're just...

940
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:05,346
Like, you mean I
should count to 60?

941
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:06,923
- What? No. No, no, no, no.
- Like, one Mississippi,

942
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:07,915
two Mississippi, and then move?

943
01:04:07,948 --> 01:04:09,083
Don't-don't count to 60.

944
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:11,251
You just got to...

945
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:14,254
S-S-So... So you're
all like-like-like,

946
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:15,923
"Oh, my God."

947
01:04:15,956 --> 01:04:20,094
Like, "All my men,
they're all...

948
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:22,062
they're all dead. All my
men, they're-they're..."

949
01:04:22,096 --> 01:04:25,265
So you want me to,
like, act and stuff.

950
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:26,967
Well... yeah.

951
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,479
-Like I'm-I'm sort of sad or something?
-Right.

952
01:04:28,503 --> 01:04:30,514
- Um, that's the whole point.
- 'Cause my whole platoon...

953
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:32,005
R-Right, right. Your platoon.

954
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:34,509
Your... Your men!

955
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:37,512
They've been wiped out.

956
01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:40,481
These guys, they're your family.

957
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:43,518
Your family's being,

958
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:45,653
like, murdered,

959
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:47,622
and it's your fault.

960
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:49,691
You did this to them, and you...

961
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:51,291
I-I thought it was
the Nazis that...

962
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:53,260
Okay, yeah, but it was
you who gave the order

963
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:55,028
to go down into the
Valley of Death.

964
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,397
- Okay? You decided.
- Mm-hmm.

965
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,399
Nobody else. You could've...

966
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:00,267
Mm-hmm.

967
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,670
You could've
protected them. Okay?

968
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:06,340
'Cause they trusted
you, and they loved you.

969
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:07,542
Mm-hmm.

970
01:05:07,575 --> 01:05:13,046
Now you're just
looking at this...

971
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:18,720
at this thing that you've done,

972
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:23,357
and... you can't
save them anymore.

973
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,059
Because they're all dead.

974
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:29,496
- Wow, that's, uh...
- Yeah.

975
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:32,433
Real gung ho.

976
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:36,170
Okay. Okay.

977
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:37,705
- You good?
- Lock and load.

978
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:39,440
Yeah. Yeah. Lock
and load. All right.

979
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:41,175
Good.

980
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:39,266
Uh, Sammy?

981
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:42,035
How far are you
gonna let him walk?

982
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:45,239
Cut!

983
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:52,446
Hey, that's a cut, Angelo!

984
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:54,314
- Angelo!
- Angelo!

985
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:55,683
Come back! Come back!

986
01:06:55,717 --> 01:06:57,752
- He said, "Cut!"
- Angelo, hey! -Angelo!

987
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,617
Bravo!

988
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:13,253
Bravo!

989
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:22,329
Sammy!

990
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,302
Oh, dolly!

991
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:32,339
You're not a civilian anymore.

992
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,676
That movie, my God.

993
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:36,744
It was...

994
01:09:37,945 --> 01:09:39,479
Hi, Mrs. Fabelman.

995
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:48,890
Mr. DeMille.

996
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:50,591
Come here.

997
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:53,928
- Hey, there he is.
- Congratulations, young man.

998
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,563
- Congratulations.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

999
01:09:55,596 --> 01:09:57,407
I guess you based it on
your dad's war stories, huh?

1000
01:09:57,431 --> 01:09:58,776
Sort of. You know,
but he doesn't like

1001
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,544
- to talk about it, so...
- No, I understand.

1002
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:01,903
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1003
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:03,838
Dad, Mom's getting
a ride with Bennie.

1004
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:05,338
She'll see us at home.

1005
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,583
Hey, that last scene with the...

1006
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:08,009
Why do you like blood so much?

1007
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:09,318
And are you ever
gonna make a movie

1008
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,878
with parts for girls again?

1009
01:10:10,912 --> 01:10:12,479
- Yeah.
- Make a career...

1010
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:14,448
-What?
-With girls, you know, like,

1011
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,860
because all the men stare off
into the distance all the time,

1012
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:18,753
maybe a girl could save the day.

1013
01:10:20,487 --> 01:10:22,990
Okay, what are the five steps
to save a drowning person?

1014
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:24,926
All right, one is you
swim behind the person

1015
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:26,393
so they don't grab you.

1016
01:10:26,426 --> 01:10:28,730
Two, you throw your
arm across his chest.

1017
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:30,330
- Or her chest.
- Three.

1018
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:32,399
Not Sammy. He's too
scared of girls' boobies.

1019
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:34,434
Three, you swim on your
back with the victim

1020
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:36,480
on your chest, using your
free arm to paddle yourself.

1021
01:10:36,504 --> 01:10:38,405
And speaking of boobies,
if you ever get any,

1022
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:39,774
we'll have a party. Um...

1023
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:41,485
And at the party, we'll
give her the booby prize.

1024
01:10:41,509 --> 01:10:44,478
Ha-ha. What's four?

1025
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:45,780
Um...

1026
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:49,517
Crap.

1027
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:51,018
Bring the victim to land, dummy.

1028
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:53,320
- Mm.
- Then five?

1029
01:10:53,353 --> 01:10:56,657
Call the undertaker.

1030
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,696
This is serious business.

1031
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:04,041
I got to know all of this to
get the lifesaving merit badge.

1032
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:06,634
More kids die in
swimming accidents

1033
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,035
than in any other
kind of accident.

1034
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:09,336
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1035
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,772
Not everything is a big joke.

1036
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:13,040
Okay, okay. So what's
step number five?

1037
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:15,009
It's just... You
laugh at everything,

1038
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,511
even when nothing's funny.

1039
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:18,345
You always have to be
the center of attention.

1040
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:21,849
Eat. And don't talk
with your mouth full.

1041
01:11:21,883 --> 01:11:25,385
I'm not eating this crud
before a swimming test.

1042
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:27,454
You can get cramps in the
water if you eat before,

1043
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,389
and you can drown
from getting cramps!

1044
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,558
Stop shouting at her!

1045
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:32,927
Sammy Fabelman, goddamn it!

1046
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,394
For weeks now,

1047
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:36,664
it has been nothing but
disrespect from you!

1048
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:37,632
Disrespect?!

1049
01:11:37,665 --> 01:11:40,034
Why are you being such
a little shit to me?!

1050
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:41,702
Damn it to hell,
I am your mother!

1051
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,838
I wish you weren't!

1052
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:10,932
Oh. Let me see.

1053
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:12,934
Oh, my God.

1054
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:14,101
Oh, what have I done?

1055
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:21,642
Talk to me.

1056
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,512
Oh, Sammy, please talk to me.

1057
01:12:24,545 --> 01:12:26,113
Tell me what's happening.

1058
01:12:26,147 --> 01:12:30,918
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

1059
01:12:39,994 --> 01:12:41,896
Don't go.

1060
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:25,793
Mom.

1061
01:15:26,794 --> 01:15:28,062
Mom.

1062
01:15:30,598 --> 01:15:32,133
I won't tell.

1063
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,604
I won't tell. I won't.

1064
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:40,141
I won't tell.

1065
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:41,809
I won't.

1066
01:16:02,897 --> 01:16:04,698
Sure about this?

1067
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:07,668
Mm-hmm.

1068
01:16:09,637 --> 01:16:11,872
There you go.
Bought and paid for.

1069
01:16:11,906 --> 01:16:14,675
Oh. Just a second.
It's in the back.

1070
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:20,614
Stocking up on Kodak
before the big move?

1071
01:16:20,648 --> 01:16:21,982
N-No, I'm...

1072
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:24,085
Smart. Film's cheaper
here than in California.

1073
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:27,221
I bet everything's
more expensive there.

1074
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:28,823
You're losing your
steadiest customer.

1075
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:33,327
Him and his whole family,
they're moving west.

1076
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,396
He just sold me his camera.

1077
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,965
Oh, yeah? How come?

1078
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:39,233
Says he's finished.

1079
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:41,402
Sorry about the wait, Mr. Loewy.

1080
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:43,337
We had to order it special.

1081
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:45,039
You bought a camera?

1082
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:50,244
It's for you!

1083
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,713
I know how much you loved
using it for your war picture,

1084
01:16:52,746 --> 01:16:54,257
so I figured you ought
to have one of your own.

1085
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:59,086
It's, um, a "bon voyage,"
"see you later, alligator,"

1086
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,823
"I believe in you" present
from your uncle Bennie.

1087
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,870
Because it's from me?

1088
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:19,907
This move? Huh?

1089
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:22,943
This is your dad's
glory-hallelujah moment.

1090
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:26,413
And, oy vavoy, Sammy, does
that guy ever deserve it.

1091
01:17:26,447 --> 01:17:28,149
All the way back
when, back at RCA,

1092
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:29,917
he knew what computing
was gonna be about

1093
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,286
before practically
anybody else knew it.

1094
01:17:33,988 --> 01:17:36,123
And IBM?

1095
01:17:36,157 --> 01:17:38,225
That's where guys like
Burt are figuring out

1096
01:17:38,259 --> 01:17:40,861
how to use what he's made to...

1097
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:42,930
They're gonna change
the whole goddamn world,

1098
01:17:42,963 --> 01:17:45,266
so this was the right decision.

1099
01:17:48,802 --> 01:17:50,971
For all sorts of reasons.

1100
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:57,144
Yeah, so I'm happy for you.

1101
01:17:57,178 --> 01:17:59,213
You know I am.

1102
01:17:59,246 --> 01:18:01,048
But I'm gonna miss you.

1103
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:04,084
All of you, a lot.

1104
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,494
You think whatever bad things
you want about me, kiddo,

1105
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:14,929
but you stop making movies,

1106
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:17,731
it'll break your mother's heart.

1107
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:20,201
You will break her
heart, I mean it.

1108
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,404
She doesn't deserve
that, not from anybody,

1109
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:25,973
least of all from you.

1110
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:41,722
I'll give you 35 bucks for it.

1111
01:18:42,323 --> 01:18:44,725
You drive a hard bargain, kid.

1112
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:04,011
I'm still done making
movies, though.

1113
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:07,748
Everybody makes
movies in California.

1114
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,157
Hey!

1115
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:18,993

01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:37,545
A few months, in the spring.

1122
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:39,413
Can I have my own room?

1123
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:42,116
Everybody gets their own room.

1124
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:44,184
- Yay!
- Yes!

1125
01:19:50,324 --> 01:19:52,926
I just remembered, last
night, I had a funny dream.

1126
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,529
What was it?

1127
01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:57,097
I-I can't believe
I dreamed this.

1128
01:19:57,131 --> 01:20:00,000
Uh, uh, uh, Bennie and me
were having an argument,

1129
01:20:00,034 --> 01:20:04,071

Is Mommy carsick?

1135
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,256
Let's just give
her a little time.

1136
01:20:45,245 --> 01:20:48,349
Bennie and me, we never...

1137
01:20:48,382 --> 01:20:50,417
we never...

1138
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:56,357
I would never let it get as
far as I imagine you think.

1139
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:59,661
Oh, I never imagined
any of that.

1140
01:20:59,694 --> 01:21:02,463
You think Dad knows?

1141
01:21:02,496 --> 01:21:03,997
I don't... I don't mean...

1142
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:05,432
I don't mean, "Did
you tell him?"

1143
01:21:05,466 --> 01:21:07,000
I know you didn't.

1144
01:21:07,635 --> 01:21:09,436
But...

1145
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,410
But you think he has an inkling?

1146
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:22,182
I've almost told
him so many times.

1147
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:24,519
I'll say, "Burt,
there's something

1148
01:21:24,552 --> 01:21:27,087
I've got to tell you."

1149
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:29,089
Then he looks at me
like he can't conceive

1150
01:21:29,123 --> 01:21:30,692
that anything could
be wrong between us,

1151
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:33,394
so instead, I say,
"Burt, we got ants."

1152
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:37,197
Or, "Burt, could you
climb on the roof

1153
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:39,233
and turn the antenna so
I can watch channel 5?"

1154
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,935
Which, of course, he does.

1155
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:49,243
I can't fight with your father.

1156
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:54,081
He kills with such kindness.

1157
01:21:55,717 --> 01:21:57,652
I'm mean to him,
he buys me a dress.

1158
01:21:57,685 --> 01:22:00,522
From Saks.

1159
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,292
Mom, when I showed
you what I filmed,

1160
01:22:05,325 --> 01:22:07,494
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

1161
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,531
Oh... mmm.

1162
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,468
Guilt is a wasted emotion.

1163
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,337
Hmm.

1164
01:22:20,608 --> 01:22:23,343
What's gonna happen now?

1165
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:28,616
I'm gonna be your mom.

1166
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:32,453
I'm gonna be the girls' mom.

1167
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:34,154
Despite my countless faults,

1168
01:22:34,188 --> 01:22:36,558
I'm not ruining
everything for everyone.

1169
01:22:36,591 --> 01:22:38,959
I'm gonna not be selfish.

1170
01:22:41,395 --> 01:22:44,666
Burt Fabelman is the
kindest, smartest, wisest,

1171
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,468
most patient, most decent,

1172
01:22:47,502 --> 01:22:49,403
most understanding man there is,

1173
01:22:49,436 --> 01:22:52,439
and I'm gonna stay
married to him.

1174
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:17,231
It's only a rental.

1175
01:23:17,264 --> 01:23:18,666
The new house will be ready

1176
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,668
faster than you can
say "Jack Robinson."

1177
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:23,136
Jack Robinson.

1178
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:27,140
And we're still here.

1179
01:23:28,676 --> 01:23:29,787
Just tell me if
you're going to mope

1180
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:31,278
for the rest of your life

1181
01:23:31,311 --> 01:23:32,455
or if it's something
you plan to outgrow.

1182
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:34,047
Bug off.

1183
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:35,726
You're, like, going for
the misery merit badge,

1184
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,417
you and Mom with
your long faces.

1185
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:39,654
She can't even get out of
bed to make breakfast and...

1186
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:41,154
Okay, new rule, guys.

1187
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,828
Um, when we walk to
school in the morning,

1188
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:45,225
let's just leave all
the Fabelman mishegoss

1189
01:23:45,259 --> 01:23:47,327
behind us in the Fabelmans'
moldy old rental house.

1190
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,697
So, for eight hours a
day, let's be normal kids

1191
01:23:49,731 --> 01:23:51,666
in an ordinary,
normal school, okay?

1192
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,669
Some glue on your
hand or something.

1193
01:23:56,169 --> 01:23:57,748
- Too easy.
- That's what I'm telling you.

1194
01:23:57,772 --> 01:24:00,407
It's like we got parachuted

1195
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,545
into the land of the
giant sequoia people.

1196
01:24:03,578 --> 01:24:05,513
All right.

1197
01:24:05,547 --> 01:24:08,650
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1198
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:12,620
Up over! Nice dig.

1199
01:24:12,654 --> 01:24:14,121
Atta Johnson.

1200
01:24:14,154 --> 01:24:16,691
- I got it. I got it.
- Get it up. Get it up.

1201
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:18,726
- Oh!
- Set, set, set, set.

1202
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,394
- Hit it.
- Take it.

1203
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:21,663
I got it.

1204
01:24:21,696 --> 01:24:24,331
Way to get up!

1205
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:26,634
Nice.

1206
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:30,772
Nice. Attababy, Logan.

1207
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,408
Do it again. Go again.

1208
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:37,144
Come on, boys.

1209
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:38,813
Good work, guys.

1210
01:24:38,846 --> 01:24:41,081
Keep the intensity. Keep moving.

1211
01:24:42,817 --> 01:24:44,586
Rotate. Nice, Jake.

1212
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:46,521
Good job, Chris.

1213
01:24:47,822 --> 01:24:49,389
Fabelman, it won't hurt you.

1214
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:50,858
It's a volleyball,
not a cannonball.

1215
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:53,761
Okay. Let's go. Serve.

1216
01:24:53,795 --> 01:24:55,429
Go!

1217
01:24:55,462 --> 01:24:56,598
Attababy!

1218
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:57,732
That's good reactions.

1219
01:24:57,765 --> 01:24:59,132
Let's move. Let's...

1220
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:03,538
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I didn't... Oh, my...

1221
01:25:03,571 --> 01:25:06,139
I'm gonna murder you,
you piece of shit!

1222
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:08,108
Hey, Chad.

1223
01:25:09,677 --> 01:25:11,244
Cool it.

1224
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:13,615
I am... I did not
mean to do that.

1225
01:25:13,648 --> 01:25:15,750
- Are you okay? I'm...
- That really hurt, asshole.

1226
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:18,118
Watch your mouth, Logan.

1227
01:25:23,256 --> 01:25:25,392
Go fetch the ball.

1228
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:28,128
Sure, yeah.

1229
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:31,498
- Let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

1230
01:25:33,735 --> 01:25:35,903
Hey, new kid.

1231
01:25:35,937 --> 01:25:38,138
What's your name?

1232
01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:41,843
Sam.

1233
01:25:41,876 --> 01:25:44,411
Sam what?

1234
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:49,383
Fabelman.

1235
01:25:51,786 --> 01:25:53,688
Told you he's a kike.

1236
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:55,523
He doesn't like Jews.

1237
01:25:55,556 --> 01:25:58,258
Nobody likes Jews.

1238
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:01,194
Except other Jews, right?

1239
01:26:02,295 --> 01:26:04,666
So, Bagelman...

1240
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:06,299
No, that's not my name.

1241
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,268
- Don't call me that.
- So...

1242
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:10,337
you gave my best friend
a concussion, Bagelman.

1243
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,807
- No, I didn't. Leave me alone.
- Hey.

1244
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,942
Don't argue with me.

1245
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:17,444
A serious concussion.

1246
01:26:18,478 --> 01:26:20,748
So, how do we make you pay?

1247
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,316
How about this? We...

1248
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,986
You're drinking
from the fountain.

1249
01:26:25,019 --> 01:26:28,422
You never hear me come up
from behind you, and bam!

1250
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:31,592
I shatter your front
teeth all over the spigot.

1251
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:35,830
Hey, look at me.

1252
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:41,301
He's demented, like, medically.

1253
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:43,971
So watch out for yourself.

1254
01:27:07,595 --> 01:27:09,731
Close the door!

1255
01:27:15,636 --> 01:27:18,305
- Mom got a monkey.
- Why'd you get a monkey?

1256
01:27:18,338 --> 01:27:19,707
'Cause I needed to laugh.

1257
01:27:23,044 --> 01:27:24,512
Oh, help me with this.

1258
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:26,748
The directions don't
make any sense.

1259
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:28,482
Careful. Careful.

1260
01:27:28,516 --> 01:27:30,585
Get down!

1261
01:27:31,384 --> 01:27:33,554
I'll get a banana.

1262
01:27:33,588 --> 01:27:36,023
Save the curtains.
They're rented.

1263
01:27:43,798 --> 01:27:45,533
Oh.

1264
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:47,969
Uh, hello.

1265
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:49,670
Who are you?

1266
01:27:49,704 --> 01:27:51,404
He's mine.

1267
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:53,608
What are we gonna call him?

1268
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:56,978
Bennie. His name's Bennie.

1269
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:06,020
I don't want to see
a psychiatrist, Burt.

1270
01:28:06,053 --> 01:28:07,454
You're scaring the kids.

1271
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:08,790
You're sleeping all day.

1272
01:28:08,823 --> 01:28:10,390
I miss the desert.

1273
01:28:10,423 --> 01:28:11,993
I miss dry heat.

1274
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:13,761
You haven't even
unwrapped the piano.

1275
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:16,731
You aren't cooking or
shopping or unpacking.

1276
01:28:16,764 --> 01:28:18,533
Psychiatrists help you know

1277
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:20,501
why you're feeling something.

1278
01:28:20,535 --> 01:28:22,369
They can't help you feel
something different.

1279
01:28:22,402 --> 01:28:24,404
You're behaving like
when your mother died,

1280
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:27,742
like you're in mourning,
but nobody's died.

1281
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:31,512
Okay.

1282
01:28:32,445 --> 01:28:35,516
So I'll call the
monkey some other name.

1283
01:28:48,563 --> 01:28:51,532
IBM's out of his league, Mitz.

1284
01:28:52,867 --> 01:28:55,837
Bennie was... He...

1285
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:59,472
is my best friend.

1286
01:28:59,507 --> 01:29:01,441
But they don't need him.

1287
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:03,611
This is what I know.

1288
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:07,548
I don't need him, either.

1289
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:12,352
Bennie wasn't your friend.

1290
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,790
But you knew he was mine.

1291
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:20,360
What does that mean?

1292
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:19,153
Logan, I'm really,
really missing you.

1293
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,692
Hey!

1294
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,694
Who's there?

1295
01:30:26,727 --> 01:30:28,796
Who's there?

1296
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:42,576
Bagelman, yo.

1297
01:30:53,988 --> 01:30:56,157
I left you a little
snack in your locker.

1298
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,225
Did you like it?

1299
01:30:58,259 --> 01:30:59,694
Guess he wasn't hungry.

1300
01:30:59,727 --> 01:31:01,696
Uh, he said... he said it was...

1301
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:03,698
- What'd you call it, Chad?
- Kosher.

1302
01:31:03,731 --> 01:31:06,000
- Kosher.
- Knock it off, moron!

1303
01:31:06,033 --> 01:31:08,836
We talked about this.

1304
01:31:08,869 --> 01:31:10,671
All right.

1305
01:31:10,705 --> 01:31:13,040
Come on. We'll be
late for practice.

1306
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:18,512
So, what is this?
Are you Jewish?

1307
01:31:21,282 --> 01:31:22,817
Well...

1308
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,719
Holy crap. He's got
the hots so bad,

1309
01:31:24,752 --> 01:31:26,253
he can't even talk to her.

1310
01:31:26,287 --> 01:31:28,889
No, I don't.

1311
01:31:28,923 --> 01:31:31,025
Apologize to her.

1312
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:33,094
For what?

1313
01:31:33,127 --> 01:31:36,030
For making goo-goo eyes at
her, for drooling at her.

1314
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:38,265
I wasn't drooling at her.

1315
01:31:38,299 --> 01:31:41,268
Then apologize to her
for killing Christ.

1316
01:31:41,302 --> 01:31:44,572
Why are you encouraging him?

1317
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,574
Go on.

1318
01:31:46,607 --> 01:31:50,044
Apologize to her for
killing our Lord.

1319
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:53,814
Ugh. Don't go.

1320
01:31:53,848 --> 01:31:55,683
- Come watch me run.
- No, thanks.

1321
01:31:55,716 --> 01:31:57,160
- I'm not in the mood now.
- Oh, please.

1322
01:31:57,184 --> 01:31:58,753
I run better when you are there.

1323
01:31:58,786 --> 01:32:01,288
Apologize to her, you
Christ-killing son of a bitch!

1324
01:32:01,322 --> 01:32:03,290
I'm going home.

1325
01:32:05,259 --> 01:32:07,028
Go on and say sorry.

1326
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:09,897
You're getting me in
trouble with my girl.

1327
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,767
You know, obviously, since
I'm not 2,000 years old

1328
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,903
and have never been to
Rome, I'm not apologizing.

1329
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:18,773
But hey, you know, maybe,
uh, your boyfriend should

1330
01:32:18,806 --> 01:32:20,941
apologize to you for
making out in the stairwell

1331
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:23,711
half an hour ago
with some redhead.

1332
01:32:23,744 --> 01:32:26,047
He-he's lying. He's...
I-I didn't do that.

1333
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,314
I swear.

1334
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:29,083
You told me you were
finished with her.

1335
01:32:30,618 --> 01:32:33,888
Logan, you lied to me!

1336
01:32:36,123 --> 01:32:37,591
Claudia.

1337
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:43,831
Whoa...

1338
01:32:46,834 --> 01:32:48,736
You made a mistake.
Listen to me.

1339
01:32:48,769 --> 01:32:50,071
You made a mistake.

1340
01:32:50,104 --> 01:32:51,681
- You're gonna fix it.
- Bash his head in!

1341
01:32:51,705 --> 01:32:53,340
Shut up, Chad, goddamn it!

1342
01:32:53,374 --> 01:32:55,643
Tomorrow, you're gonna
find her first thing,

1343
01:32:55,676 --> 01:32:57,220
and you're gonna tell
her you were lying.

1344
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:58,779
Say-say you were, um, scared.

1345
01:32:58,813 --> 01:33:00,624
Say-say whatever you got
to say, but you tell her

1346
01:33:00,648 --> 01:33:03,184
it wasn't true and you
did not see me doing that.

1347
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:05,686
Or I swear, I will hurt you

1348
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:07,922
worse than you've
ever been hurt.

1349
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:10,724
You get me?

1350
01:33:10,758 --> 01:33:13,594
Nod to show you dig
what I'm saying.

1351
01:33:26,307 --> 01:33:28,042
He won't tell me who did this.

1352
01:33:28,075 --> 01:33:30,377
Ask him who did this.

1353
01:33:30,411 --> 01:33:32,379
Tell your father who did
this, and he will drive

1354
01:33:32,413 --> 01:33:34,124
to that little shit's
house, and he will beat

1355
01:33:34,148 --> 01:33:36,159
- the living crap out of him.
- Is your nose broken?

1356
01:33:36,183 --> 01:33:38,028
No, of course it's not broken.
You think I'd be sitting here

1357
01:33:38,052 --> 01:33:39,429
- if his nose was broken?
- Who hit you?

1358
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:41,122
What do you care who it was?

1359
01:33:41,155 --> 01:33:43,124
It's not like you'll
do anything about it.

1360
01:33:43,157 --> 01:33:44,658
Tell me what happened first.

1361
01:33:44,692 --> 01:33:46,660
What happened is I hate it here,

1362
01:33:46,694 --> 01:33:49,797
and what happened is you
brought us here because...

1363
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:51,999
Because I got a better
job, so we moved.

1364
01:33:52,032 --> 01:33:54,869
You don't even
care where you are.

1365
01:33:54,902 --> 01:33:57,138
You get to go to work, and
that could be in Iceland.

1366
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:59,340
You're working with
your goddamn machines,

1367
01:33:59,373 --> 01:34:02,409
so you get to be happy while
the rest of us are mis...

1368
01:34:02,443 --> 01:34:04,011
- Just, come on.
- Don't.

1369
01:34:04,044 --> 01:34:05,755
Well, but you-you're
bleeding on the carpet.

1370
01:34:05,779 --> 01:34:07,014
It's a rental house.

1371
01:34:07,047 --> 01:34:09,116
Do you even notice how
much we hate it here,

1372
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:12,419
where we're practically the
only Jewish people for miles

1373
01:34:12,453 --> 01:34:14,855
and everything is awful?

1374
01:34:14,889 --> 01:34:18,425
Do you even care that
this is your fault...

1375
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:19,894
Everything that's
happening now...

1376
01:34:19,927 --> 01:34:21,428
Just because you
ran away from home

1377
01:34:21,462 --> 01:34:22,930
and took all of us with you?!

1378
01:34:22,963 --> 01:34:25,065
I came here so I could
work ten times harder

1379
01:34:25,099 --> 01:34:26,734
with ten times the
responsibility,

1380
01:34:26,767 --> 01:34:28,111
which seems to have
escaped everybody,

1381
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:29,770
s-so I could build
us a nice home and...

1382
01:34:29,803 --> 01:34:31,114
Could everyone settle?
I want to say something.

1383
01:34:31,138 --> 01:34:32,907
No, no. You didn't come
here to build houses.

1384
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:34,775
You didn't come here
to work. You ran away.

1385
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:36,386
I think you have something
to say to me, Sammy!

1386
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:37,978
And if I'm right about that,

1387
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:39,789
then get it off your chest
and say it to my face!

1388
01:34:39,813 --> 01:34:42,116
I started therapy.

1389
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:19,079
Anyways,

1390
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:21,081
what I really wanted
to say is that,

1391
01:36:21,115 --> 01:36:23,017
about yesterday, what
I told you was...

1392
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,252
it wasn't true, and I lied,

1393
01:36:25,286 --> 01:36:27,421
and I'm sorry.

1394
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,056
But why?

1395
01:36:29,089 --> 01:36:31,025
- What did I ever do to you?
- Oh, no, no.

1396
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:33,036
- It wasn't about you.
- Because that, like, really,

1397
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,038
- really wasn't cool, you know?
- No, I didn't mean to hurt...

1398
01:36:35,062 --> 01:36:37,340
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Because I really love Logan.

1399
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:38,509
Yeah, she cried herself to sleep

1400
01:36:38,533 --> 01:36:39,867
thinking he cheated on her.

1401
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,077
You ought to be more considerate

1402
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:43,103
of other people's feelings.

1403
01:36:43,137 --> 01:36:44,948
Okay, but Logan told me
to say I killed Christ.

1404
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:46,206
- That wasn't Logan.
- What?

1405
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,908
- That was Chad.
- Why would he do that?

1406
01:36:47,941 --> 01:36:49,977
Logan laughed. He
thought it was hilarious.

1407
01:36:51,345 --> 01:36:53,314
He's Jewish.

1408
01:36:53,347 --> 01:36:55,182
You don't say.

1409
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:59,086
Yeah, I mean, since the
day I was circumcised.

1410
01:37:06,661 --> 01:37:09,063
So, how'd you know
she was a redhead?

1411
01:37:09,096 --> 01:37:11,131
- Oh, my God.
- Hmm?

1412
01:37:11,165 --> 01:37:13,367
He was making out
with Renee Reynolds?

1413
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:18,472
- If you were lying...
- Mm-hmm?

1414
01:37:18,506 --> 01:37:20,941
How'd you know her hair color?

1415
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,179
Uh...

1416
01:37:30,652 --> 01:37:33,220
Does it hurt?

1417
01:37:33,253 --> 01:37:35,189
So, you don't believe in Jesus?

1418
01:37:35,222 --> 01:37:37,257
Monica's, like,
totally hot on Jesus.

1419
01:37:38,526 --> 01:37:40,027
I can't imagine my
life without him.

1420
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,197
Well, we've managed
for like 5,000 years,

1421
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:45,667
so I guess it's possible.

1422
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,268
Maybe we could...

1423
01:37:48,302 --> 01:37:51,606
I don't know, get
together and pray on it.

1424
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:56,143
What, like, you and me?

1425
01:37:56,176 --> 01:37:58,379
We can ask him to
come into your heart

1426
01:37:58,412 --> 01:38:02,950
and, you know, see what happens.

1427
01:38:03,984 --> 01:38:05,620
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1428
01:38:05,653 --> 01:38:07,187
I mean...

1429
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:10,023
What? Like, that would be,
like, when? Like, today?

1430
01:38:14,294 --> 01:38:17,197
It's a lot, huh?

1431
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:21,235
It's sort of a shrine almost.

1432
01:38:21,268 --> 01:38:23,404
A shrine to guys.

1433
01:38:23,437 --> 01:38:25,005
L-Lots of guys.

1434
01:38:25,038 --> 01:38:27,441
They're sexy.

1435
01:38:27,474 --> 01:38:29,443
I guess.

1436
01:38:32,647 --> 01:38:34,649
I mean, not Jesus.

1437
01:38:34,682 --> 01:38:37,050
Jesus is sexy.

1438
01:38:38,152 --> 01:38:40,154
Isn't that, like,
a sin or something?

1439
01:38:40,187 --> 01:38:41,989
I don't know.

1440
01:38:42,022 --> 01:38:44,324
He came to us as a man.

1441
01:38:44,358 --> 01:38:46,728
A handsome young man.

1442
01:38:46,761 --> 01:38:49,997
He could've come as
a girl or an old man

1443
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,999
or someone with leprosy, but...

1444
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:54,234
Nobody knows what he
really looked like.

1445
01:38:55,068 --> 01:38:57,137
Probably, he looked like you.

1446
01:38:57,171 --> 01:38:59,574
Oh, because... because he was...

1447
01:38:59,607 --> 01:39:01,108
Jewish.

1448
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:03,343
A handsome Jewish boy.

1449
01:39:04,612 --> 01:39:06,947
Just like you.

1450
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,998
Let's pray.

1451
01:39:31,371 --> 01:39:33,440
Close your eyes.

1452
01:39:35,342 --> 01:39:37,579
Lord, I'm here with
my friend Sammy...

1453
01:39:37,612 --> 01:39:38,780
Sam.

1454
01:39:38,813 --> 01:39:41,215
I'm here with my
good friend Sam,

1455
01:39:41,248 --> 01:39:45,553
who's Jewish, and
he's a nice boy.

1456
01:39:45,587 --> 01:39:50,190
Lord Jesus, he's good and brave,

1457
01:39:50,224 --> 01:39:54,361
and he's funny, Lord, and...

1458
01:39:54,394 --> 01:39:57,130
and I like him.

1459
01:40:01,268 --> 01:40:03,237
Relax.

1460
01:40:07,642 --> 01:40:09,343
Ask.

1461
01:40:10,678 --> 01:40:12,514
Ask him to come into you.

1462
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:15,048
Ask him to enter you.

1463
01:40:17,484 --> 01:40:19,521
Um...

1464
01:40:19,554 --> 01:40:21,656
hi there, Jesus.

1465
01:40:21,689 --> 01:40:24,458
It's me, Sam Fabelman.

1466
01:40:26,126 --> 01:40:28,262
If you're real, show me

1467
01:40:28,295 --> 01:40:30,464
- a sign or something, and...
- No, wait. You can't...

1468
01:40:30,497 --> 01:40:34,434
You can't ask Jesus to
do tricks to impress you.

1469
01:40:34,468 --> 01:40:36,136
You have to be humble.

1470
01:40:36,169 --> 01:40:38,640
You have to beg
him to. I'll do it.

1471
01:40:39,574 --> 01:40:42,476
I'm gonna beg the Holy
Spirit to come into me.

1472
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:45,613
I'm gonna draw the
Spirit in with my breath.

1473
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:49,684
Spirit, come into me!

1474
01:40:49,717 --> 01:40:51,686
Please, Holy Spirit!

1475
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:54,187
I'm begging you,
sweet Holy Father,

1476
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:56,323
for the sake of my friend Sammy.

1477
01:40:56,356 --> 01:40:57,491
Sam.

1478
01:40:57,525 --> 01:40:59,359
Come into us, Jesus!

1479
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:01,161
Hear our prayer!

1480
01:41:01,194 --> 01:41:02,630
Open your mouth.

1481
01:41:02,664 --> 01:41:06,300
Open your mouth and take the
spirit of Christ into you.

1482
01:41:33,928 --> 01:41:35,897
Monica, Sammy, I made snacks.

1483
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:38,198
We're coming!

1484
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:40,133
- Oh...
- Tomorrow after school,

1485
01:41:40,167 --> 01:41:41,779
want to meet out back
behind the bleachers?

1486
01:41:41,803 --> 01:41:43,504
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1487
01:41:43,538 --> 01:41:45,506
We can pray some more.

1488
01:41:55,382 --> 01:41:58,385
When I was a girl
and I felt sad,

1489
01:41:58,418 --> 01:42:01,154
I'd go to the zoo and
I'd watch the monkeys.

1490
01:42:01,188 --> 01:42:02,757
They made you laugh?

1491
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:05,225
Yeah, yeah, the monkeyshines.

1492
01:42:05,258 --> 01:42:07,260
Oh, but there was
more to it than that.

1493
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:09,229
It was...

1494
01:42:09,262 --> 01:42:11,298
They understand what
we've done to them,

1495
01:42:11,331 --> 01:42:13,266
with the cages and
the people pointing.

1496
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,902
We share that with them,

1497
01:42:14,936 --> 01:42:17,304
the truth of how
cruel people are.

1498
01:42:17,337 --> 01:42:18,840
But if you watch
them for long enough,

1499
01:42:18,873 --> 01:42:21,776
you can tell they know stuff
we can't begin to imagine.

1500
01:42:21,809 --> 01:42:23,645
Important stuff.

1501
01:42:23,678 --> 01:42:25,780
And they're not
gonna let us in on it

1502
01:42:25,813 --> 01:42:27,782
'cause it belongs to them.

1503
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:29,651
It's their own monkey business.

1504
01:42:29,684 --> 01:42:32,486
Theirs. It's not ours. It's...

1505
01:42:33,788 --> 01:42:35,823
Oh, I don't know.

1506
01:42:35,857 --> 01:42:37,625
Self-possession.

1507
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,594
Right.

1508
01:42:40,895 --> 01:42:43,296
They belong to themselves.

1509
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,533
If it belongs to itself,

1510
01:42:45,566 --> 01:42:47,935
let it go back to
where it came from.

1511
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:50,203
Anyway, that's how
come I got a monkey.

1512
01:42:50,237 --> 01:42:51,973
And a therapist.

1513
01:42:52,006 --> 01:42:53,875
He throws his poop.

1514
01:42:53,908 --> 01:42:55,710
The therapist?

1515
01:42:55,743 --> 01:42:56,911
No, the monkey.

1516
01:42:56,944 --> 01:42:58,513
That's why I'm
staying in a hotel.

1517
01:42:58,546 --> 01:43:00,815
You don't have to. We
have plenty of room.

1518
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:02,884
My rabbi in New Jersey says

1519
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:05,352
a monkey in the
house isn't kosher.

1520
01:43:05,385 --> 01:43:06,954
That's why we're not
going to eat him.

1521
01:43:06,988 --> 01:43:08,666
Did you schedule him
for his polio vaccine?

1522
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:10,424
- They can get polio?
- Pass the peas.

1523
01:43:10,457 --> 01:43:11,835
Well, they're susceptible
to pretty much everything

1524
01:43:11,859 --> 01:43:13,928
- humans are, so yes.
- He hates going to the vet.

1525
01:43:13,961 --> 01:43:15,530
You see, Monica, in this family,

1526
01:43:15,563 --> 01:43:17,799
it's the scientists
versus the artists.

1527
01:43:17,832 --> 01:43:19,299
Sammy's on my team.

1528
01:43:19,332 --> 01:43:21,435
Takes after me, except
he's got real talent.

1529
01:43:21,468 --> 01:43:22,369
Mom.

1530
01:43:22,402 --> 01:43:23,914
And he's completely
terrible at science.

1531
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:25,573
Mm. And algebra.

1532
01:43:25,606 --> 01:43:26,607
And sports.

1533
01:43:26,641 --> 01:43:29,276
- Will you please stop?
- He showed me his camera.

1534
01:43:29,309 --> 01:43:31,344
Is he good at kissing?

1535
01:43:31,378 --> 01:43:32,814
- I'll tell you later.
- Shut up!

1536
01:43:32,847 --> 01:43:35,382
-He sleeps with a camera under his pillow.
-No, I don't.

1537
01:43:35,415 --> 01:43:36,994
But he refuses to
actually shoot anything.

1538
01:43:37,018 --> 01:43:38,920
He should shoot Ditch Day.

1539
01:43:38,953 --> 01:43:41,288
-Mm. Mm-mm.
-They still don't have a photographer.

1540
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:42,599
- You could volunteer.
- What's Ditch Day?

1541
01:43:42,623 --> 01:43:44,391
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

1542
01:43:44,424 --> 01:43:45,736
Something seniors get to
do at the end of the year.

1543
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,538
They let us pretend like
we're ditching school,

1544
01:43:47,562 --> 01:43:49,797
and we all take buses to
Santa Cruz Main Beach.

1545
01:43:49,831 --> 01:43:51,465
You have to go! Everyone goes.

1546
01:43:51,498 --> 01:43:53,366
My dad will lend you his camera.

1547
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,769
It's super fancy.

1548
01:43:54,802 --> 01:43:56,470
Costs like a thousand dollars.

1549
01:43:56,504 --> 01:43:59,306
It's called, like, a... an
"Air" something. I forget.

1550
01:43:59,339 --> 01:44:00,908
- Wait, not an Arriflex.
- Right.

1551
01:44:00,942 --> 01:44:04,311
Your dad owns a 16
millimeter Arriflex?

1552
01:44:05,345 --> 01:44:06,623
Wow. Wow, okay. So, 16
millimeter on stock...

1553
01:44:06,647 --> 01:44:08,826
See, usually it's the teacher
who shoots the Ditch Day movie,

1554
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:10,661
-and it's a big joke.
-That's two minutes, 45 seconds a roll.

1555
01:44:10,685 --> 01:44:12,529
At ten bucks a roll, for a
whole day, that would be,

1556
01:44:12,553 --> 01:44:14,031
- like, insanely expensive.
- I owe you a graduation check.

1557
01:44:14,055 --> 01:44:15,757
My dad will get the
school to pay for it.

1558
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:17,534
And I need to rent a 16
millimeter editing machine,

1559
01:44:17,558 --> 01:44:19,493
and I have no idea
how much that costs,

1560
01:44:19,527 --> 01:44:20,838
- so it's not gonna work.
- My dad will rent one for you.

1561
01:44:20,862 --> 01:44:23,798
Uh, we can rent it,
whatever it costs, right?

1562
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:25,800
Burt.

1563
01:44:27,467 --> 01:44:29,704
Uh, what's wrong
with your Bolex?

1564
01:44:29,737 --> 01:44:31,773
You could afford to be
a little encouraging.

1565
01:44:31,806 --> 01:44:33,440
About what?

1566
01:44:33,473 --> 01:44:35,076
About him making movies again.

1567
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:36,911
Well, I didn't say that.
I'm just talking...

1568
01:44:36,944 --> 01:44:38,913
- Maybe he's moved on.
- On from what?

1569
01:44:38,946 --> 01:44:41,448
He hasn't picked up his
camera once since we got here.

1570
01:44:41,481 --> 01:44:42,793
He'll be going to
college this September.

1571
01:44:42,817 --> 01:44:44,719
Maybe his feelings
about it have changed.

1572
01:44:44,752 --> 01:44:47,454
He's growing up. I'm
enthusiastic about that.

1573
01:44:47,487 --> 01:44:48,890
Filming is what he loves.

1574
01:44:48,923 --> 01:44:50,701
- I don't think him...
- Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

1575
01:44:50,725 --> 01:44:52,660
Guys, can we please just
stop talking about me?

1576
01:44:52,693 --> 01:44:54,104
I'd think that you,
more than anyone,

1577
01:44:54,128 --> 01:44:55,572
should have some
understanding of what a...

1578
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:56,974
Let's go to your
place or something.

1579
01:44:56,998 --> 01:44:58,733
Maybe your dad can
show me the camera.

1580
01:44:58,766 --> 01:45:00,443
- A vocation, a-a calling is.
- All right. All right.

1581
01:45:00,467 --> 01:45:01,803
We'll rent him the equipment.

1582
01:45:01,836 --> 01:45:03,403
He hates the beach.

1583
01:45:03,436 --> 01:45:04,815
That's why he doesn't
want to go to Ditch Day.

1584
01:45:04,839 --> 01:45:06,073
But it's not your calling.

1585
01:45:06,107 --> 01:45:08,441
Is that why you
can't, uh, respect it?

1586
01:45:08,475 --> 01:45:09,944
I have respect for everything

1587
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:11,679
- he works hard doing.
- He's afraid.

1588
01:45:11,712 --> 01:45:13,657
He's scared if he does, those
guys will beat him up again.

1589
01:45:13,681 --> 01:45:15,826
What? No, I'm not. I never
said that I was scared of them.

1590
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,618
- You don't, though.
- You got beat up?

1591
01:45:17,652 --> 01:45:19,620
You always dismiss what
he does, what anyone does,

1592
01:45:19,654 --> 01:45:23,724
that's playful or imaginative
as a pastime or a hobby.

1593
01:45:23,758 --> 01:45:25,425
You already won, Mitz.

1594
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:27,394
I surrendered. I'm
not taking the bait.

1595
01:45:27,427 --> 01:45:28,806
Can you guys please
just cut it out?

1596
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:30,707
- Oh, who's baiting who?
- You're embarrassing me.

1597
01:45:30,731 --> 01:45:32,408
I said I'd take him for his
polio shot the first five times

1598
01:45:32,432 --> 01:45:33,710
- you asked me, didn't I?
- Well, you say you will,

1599
01:45:33,734 --> 01:45:35,903
but I guess you don't
mean it, so I ask again

1600
01:45:35,937 --> 01:45:37,681
- and again and again.
- He's scared of shots.

1601
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:40,508
He's scared of the doctor.

1602
01:45:41,474 --> 01:45:44,512
I am taking the goddamn
monkey to the vet, okay?

1603
01:45:44,545 --> 01:45:45,980
Probably needs a tranquilizer

1604
01:45:46,013 --> 01:45:47,548
with all this yelling.

1605
01:45:47,582 --> 01:45:49,917
Can you ask your dad about
borrowing the camera?

1606
01:45:49,951 --> 01:45:51,586
He'll say yes.

1607
01:45:51,619 --> 01:45:53,420
Thank you.

1608
01:45:53,453 --> 01:45:55,957
I'm filming Ditch Day.

1609
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:57,792

Your mom misses
Phoenix too much.

1645
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:18,926
Tell them the truth.

1646
01:49:18,959 --> 01:49:20,728
And I can't leave.

1647
01:49:20,761 --> 01:49:22,863
This is where my work is.

1648
01:49:22,897 --> 01:49:23,964
I have to...

1649
01:49:23,998 --> 01:49:25,666
That's crazy.

1650
01:49:25,699 --> 01:49:28,302
You... you can't ruin everything

1651
01:49:28,335 --> 01:49:30,704
because you miss one place

1652
01:49:30,738 --> 01:49:32,940
and you're stuck someplace else.

1653
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:35,676
I miss Bennie too much.

1654
01:49:35,709 --> 01:49:37,078
So?

1655
01:49:37,111 --> 01:49:38,946
We all miss him.

1656
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:42,116
This is a different
kind of missing.

1657
01:49:42,149 --> 01:49:43,884
Because what?

1658
01:49:44,718 --> 01:49:46,353
You love Bennie?

1659
01:49:46,387 --> 01:49:48,055
Don't you love Daddy?

1660
01:49:48,089 --> 01:49:49,223
Sure she does.

1661
01:49:49,256 --> 01:49:51,092
- Of course I love Dad.
- And I love Mom.

1662
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:53,360
Then why is this all
of a sudden happening?!

1663
01:49:53,394 --> 01:49:55,362
Stay together.

1664
01:49:55,396 --> 01:49:58,199
You love each other,
and you love us,

1665
01:49:58,232 --> 01:49:59,800
and we don't want this.

1666
01:49:59,834 --> 01:50:02,103
We don't want to have
to move back and forth

1667
01:50:02,136 --> 01:50:03,404
and not live with both of you.

1668
01:50:03,437 --> 01:50:05,239
We can't. Dad, we can't.

1669
01:50:05,272 --> 01:50:06,841
You're always so mean to him!

1670
01:50:06,874 --> 01:50:08,742
That's why you're
getting divorced!

1671
01:50:08,776 --> 01:50:10,678
It's because of you!

1672
01:50:10,711 --> 01:50:11,979
Don't blame your mom.

1673
01:50:12,012 --> 01:50:14,014
This wasn't her
idea. It was mine.

1674
01:50:14,048 --> 01:50:17,017
- Don't-don't say that.
- No, it wasn't.

1675
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:19,753
She just said it was because
of Bennie, so stop lying!

1676
01:50:19,787 --> 01:50:21,922
Both of you, stop lying!

1677
01:50:21,956 --> 01:50:24,024
I'm giving your mom a chance

1678
01:50:24,058 --> 01:50:28,996

to your beach blanket
movie after that.

1686
01:50:59,426 --> 01:51:01,929
We're different, I guess.

1687
01:51:17,878 --> 01:51:20,147
Is she gonna marry Bennie?

1688
01:51:20,948 --> 01:51:23,117
If she wants to, she will.

1689
01:51:24,919 --> 01:51:27,154
God, she's the most selfish
person in the world.

1690
01:51:27,188 --> 01:51:30,324
It must've been hard
for her, married to a...

1691
01:51:30,357 --> 01:51:32,359
a genius.

1692
01:51:32,393 --> 01:51:34,328
Dad worships Mom.

1693
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:35,896
Okay.

1694
01:51:36,964 --> 01:51:40,868
But maybe it's hard being
worshipped by someone

1695
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:42,870
you know you'll
never be as good as

1696
01:51:42,903 --> 01:51:45,039
or ever do anything as good as.

1697
01:51:45,072 --> 01:51:46,307
She...

1698
01:51:47,374 --> 01:51:49,910
She laughs at Bennie's jokes...

1699
01:51:51,378 --> 01:51:54,448
but Dad's always been
her best audience.

1700
01:51:54,481 --> 01:51:56,483
Come on.

1701
01:51:56,518 --> 01:51:58,352
She'll be fine.

1702
01:51:58,385 --> 01:52:01,488
She'll tell herself everything
happens for a reason.

1703
01:52:01,523 --> 01:52:03,824
She'll make excuses
like she always does.

1704
01:52:03,857 --> 01:52:05,960
You're way more
selfish than her.

1705
01:52:07,494 --> 01:52:09,496
That's why you're angry at her.

1706
01:52:09,531 --> 01:52:12,466
It's because she's scared,

1707
01:52:12,499 --> 01:52:14,835
just like you, Sammy.

1708
01:52:15,869 --> 01:52:19,807

But I can't fly.

1904
02:03:48,729 --> 02:03:50,865
I can outrun any guy
in Santa Clara County,

1905
02:03:50,898 --> 02:03:52,767
and I worked real
hard to do that.

1906
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,536
But you... you make me feel
like I'm some kind of failure

1907
02:03:55,569 --> 02:03:57,672
or a phony or... or
like I'm supposed to be

1908
02:03:57,705 --> 02:04:00,473
some guy I'm never gonna
be, not even in my dreams.

1909
02:04:00,508 --> 02:04:01,842
You took that guy,
whoever he is,

1910
02:04:01,876 --> 02:04:03,787
wherever you got him from,
and you put him up there

1911
02:04:03,811 --> 02:04:05,947
on that screen and
told everyone...

1912
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,214
everyone that that's me.

1913
02:04:07,248 --> 02:04:09,684
And that's not me.
That's... It's...

1914
02:04:11,519 --> 02:04:14,989
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

1915
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:20,561
Jesus, it wasn't supposed
to make you upset.

1916
02:04:20,594 --> 02:04:22,630
I didn't mean to freak
you out. I didn't mean...

1917
02:04:22,663 --> 02:04:25,498
Who cares what you meant?

1918
02:04:26,734 --> 02:04:28,736
Fabelman!

1919
02:04:30,037 --> 02:04:31,505
Oh, shit.

1920
02:04:31,539 --> 02:04:32,616
You liar! You backstabbing liar!

1921
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,842
I'm gonna beat your...

1922
02:04:46,721 --> 02:04:48,723
You totally bought it,
his whole snow job.

1923
02:04:48,756 --> 02:04:50,925
You ate it up. You moron.

1924
02:04:50,958 --> 02:04:53,728
Logan, you are so
conceited and dumb.

1925
02:05:19,086 --> 02:05:21,722
Is something about to happen?

1926
02:05:22,723 --> 02:05:24,625
You like living
dangerously, Fabelman.

1927
02:05:24,658 --> 02:05:26,260
No, I don't. I
really, really don't.

1928
02:05:26,293 --> 02:05:27,962
Yes, you do.

1929
02:05:27,995 --> 02:05:32,066
But you tell anybody
about me getting, um...

1930
02:05:32,099 --> 02:05:35,703
upset, that would be a mistake.

1931
02:05:37,938 --> 02:05:39,306
Our secret.

1932
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:41,042
Okay?

1933
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:42,910
Definitely.

1934
02:05:46,347 --> 02:05:48,816
Unless I make a movie about it.

1935
02:05:49,884 --> 02:05:52,686
Which I'm never ever gonna do.

1936
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:20,047
You never...

1937
02:06:21,182 --> 02:06:23,050
What's it like?

1938
02:06:24,852 --> 02:06:28,055
It kind of shows you how
out of control everything is

1939
02:06:28,089 --> 02:06:32,760
and how y-you're not
in charge of anything.

1940
02:06:35,196 --> 02:06:37,331
A-And how it doesn't matter.

1941
02:06:37,364 --> 02:06:39,133
I better not.

1942
02:06:40,167 --> 02:06:43,037
In my head, everything's
already out of control.

1943
02:06:45,372 --> 02:06:47,675
You're full of shit.

1944
02:06:47,708 --> 02:06:50,611
I got to split.
Claudia's waiting for me.

1945
02:06:55,749 --> 02:06:59,220
Life's nothing like
the movies, Fabelman.

1946
02:06:59,253 --> 02:07:00,721
Maybe not.

1947
02:07:00,754 --> 02:07:03,190
But hey, in the end...

1948
02:07:03,224 --> 02:07:05,626
you got the girl.

1949
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:31,252
Must have been some night.

1950
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:36,323
Did Monica like the corsage?

1951
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:39,727
- Yeah.
- Well, I told you she would.

1952
02:07:47,468 --> 02:07:49,803
That time when I hit you...

1953
02:07:49,837 --> 02:07:52,806
In-in Phoenix, when I...

1954
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:55,276
Oh, God. You remember.

1955
02:07:56,877 --> 02:07:58,946
Not really.

1956
02:07:58,979 --> 02:08:00,848
Oh, for the love of
God, it's not like

1957
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:03,217
I spent my whole
life hitting you.

1958
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,920
Once. I hit you once.

1959
02:08:05,953 --> 02:08:07,454
It should've been memorable.

1960
02:08:07,488 --> 02:08:09,190
Before the swimming test.

1961
02:08:09,223 --> 02:08:11,058
Yes, before the swimming test!

1962
02:08:11,091 --> 02:08:13,327
Yes. Well, I-I...

1963
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,931
I s-slapped you on your back...

1964
02:08:17,998 --> 02:08:20,067
as hard as I could. I
screwed up your tryouts,

1965
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:21,936
and you-you couldn't
get your merit badge,

1966
02:08:21,969 --> 02:08:23,380
and then you couldn't
make Eagle Scout.

1967
02:08:23,404 --> 02:08:25,005
- Ma, I made Eagle Scout.
- And I...

1968
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:27,017
- It wasn't a big deal.
- Well, I left a goddamn mark

1969
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:29,910
on your skin in the
sh-shape of my hand.

1970
02:08:29,944 --> 02:08:32,213
And I need you to say you
forgive me for doing that.

1971
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:35,916
- Well, okay. I forgive you.
- Because... Because...

1972
02:08:37,084 --> 02:08:39,053
- Because you're my kid.
- Mom, I forgive you.

1973
02:08:39,086 --> 02:08:41,055
And-and-and my kids
mean more to me than...

1974
02:08:41,088 --> 02:08:43,066
- Mom, I forgive you.
- Anything else on the Earth.

1975
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:44,959
- I forgive you.
- Because...

1976
02:08:44,992 --> 02:08:47,237
Please, please. Because how am
I ever gonna forgive myself?

1977
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,396
- I can't.
- Mom, I-I-I...

1978
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:51,131
I forgive you.

1979
02:08:51,165 --> 02:08:53,100
The eggs are burning.

1980
02:08:53,133 --> 02:08:55,402
Oh, God.

1981
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:02,910
I'm doing this thing.

1982
02:09:03,877 --> 02:09:06,247
And I-I don't know if
it's the right thing,

1983
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:08,916
but it's a life-and-death
thing for me.

1984
02:09:08,949 --> 02:09:11,452
And I'm sorry,
but everybody else

1985
02:09:11,485 --> 02:09:13,555
is gonna have to hang
on for dear life.

1986
02:09:13,588 --> 02:09:15,889
And somehow,

1987
02:09:15,923 --> 02:09:19,293
we will survive this, all of us.

1988
02:09:19,326 --> 02:09:22,396
Even your father, who I
adore with all my heart.

1989
02:09:22,429 --> 02:09:26,767
He deserves so much better
than what I'm doing, but...

1990
02:09:29,571 --> 02:09:32,406
but Bennie needs me, dolly.

1991
02:09:32,439 --> 02:09:34,509
And I need him.

1992
02:09:34,542 --> 02:09:36,110
So much so that without him,

1993
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:38,045
I'm turning into
someone I don't know

1994
02:09:38,078 --> 02:09:41,048
and none of you will
know me anymore.

1995
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:42,983
I'll just be that hateful person

1996
02:09:43,017 --> 02:09:45,019
who did that terrible
thing to your back.

1997
02:09:45,052 --> 02:09:49,156
And yes, this is the most
selfish thing I have ever done,

1998
02:09:49,189 --> 02:09:53,060
but I've got to do this
now because, Sammy...

1999
02:09:54,261 --> 02:09:57,298
you do what your heart
says you have to,

2000
02:09:57,331 --> 02:10:00,334
'cause you don't owe
anyone your life.

2001
02:10:01,503 --> 02:10:03,437
Not even me.

2002
02:10:09,577 --> 02:10:11,613
Oh... Are they ruined?

2003
02:10:11,646 --> 02:10:14,582
I-I-I can make some more.

2004
02:10:14,616 --> 02:10:16,350
Oh, no, no, no.

2005
02:10:16,383 --> 02:10:18,152
I like 'em burnt.

2006
02:10:22,089 --> 02:10:24,158
So, Monica dumped me.

2007
02:10:24,191 --> 02:10:25,993
She did?

2008
02:10:26,026 --> 02:10:28,829
Yeah, after I told
her about the divorce.

2009
02:10:29,496 --> 02:10:31,131
Huh?

2010
02:10:32,166 --> 02:10:34,569
Probably shouldn't have
asked her to marry me.

2011
02:10:34,602 --> 02:10:36,870
- You did not.
- Oh, but...

2012
02:10:36,904 --> 02:10:39,373
Oh. You did?

2013
02:10:40,542 --> 02:10:44,044
- In so many words.
- Poor girl.

2014
02:11:05,332 --> 02:11:06,601
Dad?

2015
02:11:10,505 --> 02:11:12,873
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

2016
02:11:23,685 --> 02:11:25,620
Sammy?

2017
02:11:31,559 --> 02:11:33,894
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

2018
02:11:39,567 --> 02:11:41,536
Come here.

2019
02:11:50,177 --> 02:11:52,146
It's a panic attack.
Your mother gets them.

2020
02:11:52,179 --> 02:11:54,549
-What did you do when she'd get them?
-I made her tea.

2021
02:11:54,582 --> 02:11:56,183
Okay.

2022
02:12:02,122 --> 02:12:05,025
Plus, you're exhausted.

2023
02:12:05,058 --> 02:12:06,994
You don't sleep.

2024
02:12:07,027 --> 02:12:08,696
I hear you walking
around all night

2025
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:10,264
or typing those letters,

2026
02:12:10,297 --> 02:12:11,742
and the three hours'
drive to the college

2027
02:12:11,766 --> 02:12:13,668
- every day and back, it's...
- Oh, no, no, no.

2028
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:15,302
I can't go back to that dorm.

2029
02:12:15,335 --> 02:12:17,004
Maybe your roommate
settled down.

2030
02:12:17,037 --> 02:12:18,439
He voted for Goldwater.

2031
02:12:18,472 --> 02:12:20,474
I can't go back.

2032
02:12:20,508 --> 02:12:21,743
Dad...

2033
02:12:24,746 --> 02:12:27,047
I don't know...

2034
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:29,216
what to do anymore.

2035
02:12:30,150 --> 02:12:32,119
I don't want to disappoint you,

2036
02:12:32,152 --> 02:12:35,355
and I promised that
I'd stick it out,

2037
02:12:35,389 --> 02:12:38,225
but two years is like
forever, and I hate school.

2038
02:12:38,258 --> 02:12:40,394
Like, a lot.

2039
02:12:40,427 --> 02:12:45,232
And I want to get work
on a movie or a TV show,

2040
02:12:45,265 --> 02:12:47,201
so I send out all those letters,

2041
02:12:47,234 --> 02:12:49,169
but nobody ever writes back.

2042
02:12:49,203 --> 02:12:51,606
And my life is just
going by so fast,

2043
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:53,741
but it's not getting anywhere.

2044
02:12:56,276 --> 02:12:59,179
Concentrate on sipping.
It'll calm you down.

2045
02:13:04,418 --> 02:13:06,588
Here. Uh...

2046
02:13:09,256 --> 02:13:12,259
You can go through the mail
while I get the soup hot.

2047
02:13:33,848 --> 02:13:36,316
It's from Mom.

2048
02:13:37,317 --> 02:13:39,286
It's just a bunch
of goofy photos

2049
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:41,221
from some kind of block party.

2050
02:14:27,535 --> 02:14:29,403
Dad?

2051
02:14:31,573 --> 02:14:33,407
Dad, what's...

2052
02:14:42,817 --> 02:14:44,852
Oh, Dad, I didn't mean to...

2053
02:14:44,886 --> 02:14:47,522
If you hate school
so much, don't go.

2054
02:14:48,623 --> 02:14:50,457
But... Dad, we need...

2055
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:52,192
I don't know. I
would like you to

2056
02:14:52,225 --> 02:14:54,227
because this film
thing... I don't know.

2057
02:14:54,261 --> 02:14:56,463
Maybe I should have put
my foot down about it

2058
02:14:56,496 --> 02:14:59,232
years ago, but...

2059
02:15:00,802 --> 02:15:04,137
I know you're gonna
work like the dickens

2060
02:15:04,171 --> 02:15:05,873
on whatever you wind up doing

2061
02:15:05,907 --> 02:15:09,109
because you're a chip
off the old block.

2062
02:15:13,648 --> 02:15:17,317
We're never not going to
know each other, Sammy.

2063
02:15:20,655 --> 02:15:23,223
How do you know that?

2064
02:15:23,256 --> 02:15:24,926
You and Mom don't anymore.

2065
02:15:24,959 --> 02:15:27,260
Yes, we do.

2066
02:15:27,962 --> 02:15:30,330
We always will.

2067
02:15:31,231 --> 02:15:33,635
I know it because...

2068
02:15:35,435 --> 02:15:37,705
we've gone too far in our story

2069
02:15:37,739 --> 02:15:41,141
to actually say "the end."

2070
02:15:50,384 --> 02:15:52,754
Uh, you missed
something in the mail.

2071
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:21,481
Good news?

2072
02:16:24,284 --> 02:16:26,554
<i>They've ordered 32 half hours,</i>

2073
02:16:26,587 --> 02:16:29,957
Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on CBS,
starting September 17th.

2074
02:16:29,991 --> 02:16:31,693
We already have six
shows in the can.

2075
02:16:31,726 --> 02:16:34,227
It's like <i>Stalag 17</i>
or <i>The Great Escape,</i>

2076
02:16:34,261 --> 02:16:35,830
- except it's funnier.
- Mm.

2077
02:16:35,863 --> 02:16:37,330
And it's for television.

2078
02:16:37,364 --> 02:16:38,866
- And it's funny.
- Yeah.

2079
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,568
Or at least I pray to
God that it's funny.

2080
02:16:40,601 --> 02:16:42,570
<i>Hogan's Heroes...</i>
That's the title.

2081
02:16:42,603 --> 02:16:43,971
What do you think?

2082
02:16:44,005 --> 02:16:46,239
- Pretty catchy, right?
- Catchy. Yeah.

2083
02:16:46,273 --> 02:16:47,842
And if all goes well,

2084
02:16:47,875 --> 02:16:52,513
I might be able to offer
you something next season.

2085
02:16:53,413 --> 02:16:56,416
Maybe assisting an
assistant to an assistant.

2086
02:17:01,354 --> 02:17:03,256
You don't want to
be in TV anyway.

2087
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:06,393
Um, your letter said as much.

2088
02:17:06,426 --> 02:17:08,629
By the way, I love this letter.

2089
02:17:08,663 --> 02:17:10,598
- Oh.
- I used to write a whole bunch

2090
02:17:10,631 --> 02:17:12,365
of these letters
when I was your age.

2091
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:14,836
You want to make
movies. Am I right?

2092
02:17:14,869 --> 02:17:16,470
Well, yeah. Yes, I do.

2093
02:17:16,504 --> 02:17:18,906
But look, I'm just
happy to start anywhere,

2094
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:20,742
and-and that doesn't...

2095
02:17:20,775 --> 02:17:22,476
You know who you need to meet?

2096
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:25,345
I mean, not for a job,
'cause he doesn't do that.

2097
02:17:25,378 --> 02:17:27,314
How would you like to meet

2098
02:17:27,347 --> 02:17:30,317
the greatest film
director who ever lived?

2099
02:17:30,350 --> 02:17:32,754
And he's right across the hall.

2100
02:17:34,789 --> 02:17:36,557
Come on.

2101
02:17:41,394 --> 02:17:43,363
Wait here a minute.

2102
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:54,509
Um, this is Nona.

2103
02:17:54,542 --> 02:17:56,309
Nona's gonna look after you.

2104
02:17:56,343 --> 02:17:57,645
Um, he's not here. He's...

2105
02:17:57,678 --> 02:17:59,312
- He's at lunch.
- Right.

2106
02:17:59,346 --> 02:18:01,048
- You want to wait?
- Yeah, he'll wait.

2107
02:18:01,082 --> 02:18:02,884
Sit.

2108
02:18:03,985 --> 02:18:05,720
Good luck.

2109
02:18:11,092 --> 02:18:12,794
Could be hours.

2110
02:19:41,649 --> 02:19:44,619
All right, kid, you
got five minutes.

2111
02:19:44,652 --> 02:19:46,821
Probably one. Stand up.

2112
02:19:50,224 --> 02:19:52,159
Hey. L-Lose the tie.

2113
02:19:52,193 --> 02:19:54,629
You'll stand a better chance.

2114
02:21:04,265 --> 02:21:07,001
They tell me you want
to be a picture maker.

2115
02:21:08,235 --> 02:21:10,638
Um, yes, sir, I do.

2116
02:21:10,671 --> 02:21:12,239
Why?

2117
02:21:12,273 --> 02:21:14,875
This business,
it'll rip you apart.

2118
02:21:14,909 --> 02:21:17,578
W-Well...

2119
02:21:18,879 --> 02:21:20,114
Mr. Ford, I...

2120
02:21:20,147 --> 02:21:22,482
So, what do you
know about art, kid?

2121
02:21:24,719 --> 02:21:26,253
I-I love your movies so much.

2122
02:21:26,287 --> 02:21:28,255
No. Art.

2123
02:21:28,289 --> 02:21:30,891
See that painting over there?

2124
02:21:33,027 --> 02:21:34,996
Uh, yeah. I mean yes.

2125
02:21:35,029 --> 02:21:36,597
Yes, I do see it.

2126
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:38,532
Walk over to it.

2127
02:21:44,271 --> 02:21:47,174
Well, what's in it? Describe it.

2128
02:21:47,208 --> 02:21:49,043
Oh, okay. Um...

2129
02:21:49,076 --> 02:21:51,045
So, there are two guys,

2130
02:21:51,078 --> 02:21:53,247
and they're on horseback,

2131
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,049
and they're looking
for something.

2132
02:21:55,082 --> 02:21:56,283
So maybe they're scouting...

2133
02:21:56,317 --> 02:21:58,552
No. No.

2134
02:21:58,586 --> 02:22:00,554
Where's the horizon?

2135
02:22:00,588 --> 02:22:02,723
The-the horizon?

2136
02:22:02,757 --> 02:22:05,159
- Where is it?
- Yeah, it's at the bottom.

2137
02:22:05,192 --> 02:22:07,028
That's right.

2138
02:22:07,061 --> 02:22:09,663
Walk over to this painting.

2139
02:22:15,803 --> 02:22:16,971
Well?

2140
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:20,674
Right, okay. So, there
are five cowboys.

2141
02:22:20,708 --> 02:22:22,819
-You know, they could be Indian...
-No, no, no, no, no!

2142
02:22:22,843 --> 02:22:24,645
Where's the goddamn horizon?

2143
02:22:24,678 --> 02:22:26,313
Um, it's-it's there.

2144
02:22:26,347 --> 02:22:28,249
- Where?
- At the top of the painting.

2145
02:22:28,282 --> 02:22:30,151
All right, get over here.

2146
02:22:32,286 --> 02:22:34,622
Now, remember this.

2147
02:22:34,655 --> 02:22:36,957
When the horizon's
at the bottom,

2148
02:22:36,991 --> 02:22:38,826
it's interesting.

2149
02:22:38,859 --> 02:22:41,228
When the horizon's at the top,

2150
02:22:41,262 --> 02:22:43,297
it's interesting.

2151
02:22:43,330 --> 02:22:45,366
When the horizon's
in the middle,

2152
02:22:45,399 --> 02:22:48,302
it's boring as shit.

2153
02:22:48,335 --> 02:22:51,172
Now, good luck to you.

2154
02:22:52,073 --> 02:22:54,708
And get the fuck
out of my office!

2155
02:22:54,742 --> 02:22:56,744
Okay.

2156
02:23:00,281 --> 02:23:01,982
Thank you.

2157
02:23:02,983 --> 02:23:04,919
My pleasure.
