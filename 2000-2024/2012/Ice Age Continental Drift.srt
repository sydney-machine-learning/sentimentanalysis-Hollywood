2
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,450
Goal....

3
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:31,750
- What, what was that? Ellie, did you hear that?
- I heard it Manny, whatever it is is miles away.

4
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:37,350
- Peaches, you alright? 
Where is she, no teenager is ever up early.

5
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
- Nooo... easy warden, 
she's not on lockdown.

6
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
- You two were supposed to be responsible uncles.

7
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,555
- What... I didn't see Peaches sneak 
off maybe 15-20 minutes ago.

8
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:52,670
- Or that she went with Louis to the falls.

9
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,770
- The falls... where the deliquents go!
- Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.

10
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,480
- No, no... it's a gateway hangout.
 First it's the falls then she's pucing

11
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,480
her trunk and the next thing you 
know she's addicted to berries.

12
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:11,580
- Manny, you are over-reacting. 
She's not going to be your little girl forever.

13
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,890
- I know, that's what worries me.

14
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,490
- C'mon...

15
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,490
Louis... would you get your head out of the ground for once and try to have a little fun.

16
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,105
- Ow... I'm a mole-hog, my head's 
supposed to be underground and my idea

17
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:35,070
 of fun isn't risking death so  you 
can meet some cute mammoth.

18
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:42,490
- Ethan isn't cute... he's hot. Besides you can't spend you whole life playing it safe.

19
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:46,590
- I know I would.
- Dad!! There's no reason to be mad.

20
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,590
- You know how I feel about you 
going into the falls, especially alone.

21
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:53,490
- Ahem... she's not alone sir.
- You don't count weiner.

22
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,510
- Yes, there's my place and he 
just put me in it... thankyou.

23
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,945
- C'mon young lady we're going home 
where I can keep an eye on you.

24
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,695
- So... should I just, um, wait here or...?

25
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,725
- Yeh you don't scare me mother nature, there's nothing you can throw at me that I can't handle.

26
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:37,640
- Whoohoo... I think we're almost there.
- We better be I've just lost the steering.

27
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:47,850
- Has anyone seen Precious, it's her feeding time.
- Mum, Granny's talking about her dead pet again.

28
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,725
- Hey, paws up everybody.
- Paws down, Uncle... please... that is nasty.

29
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,725
- Be careful Milton, 
you're going to hurt somebody.

30
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,750
- Bad kitty...
- Rock...!

31
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,750
- Ok, so tell me when exactly will 
I be allowed to hang out with boys?

32
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,688
- When I'm dead... plus 3 days 
just to make sure I'm dead.

33
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,555
- Manny, are you ok...?

34
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:47,455
- Get off... my face.

35
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:52,555
- That was fun... 
now, who should I eat first?

36
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,455
- Uncle Morgan, can that really be you?
- Hey... hey...

37
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:02,475
- Sorry, sorry...

38
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,775
- Mum, dad... pop.
Marshall...

39
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,265
- Hey...
- Granny?

40
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,775
- This rump is ripe for picking.

41
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,675
- Oh, my whole familiar.
- See, he still hugs his parents.

42
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:20,876
- I never thought I would see my little baby again, we've been searching everywhere for you.

43
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,925
- You have? I knew it, I knew it... 
deep down I  knew I wasn't abandoned.

44
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:32,500
- Ahah that's incorrect, we totally abandoned you.
- But... we always missed you. Right...

45
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:41,510
- Yeh, right. Yeh, yeh, yeh... And we just knew Sid would want to see his poor dear Granny before... her time is up.

46
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,510
- I'll bury y'all and dance on your grave.
- So frail.

47
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,560
- And she can't wait to spend time with you Sid.
- Oh yeh... Granny, Granny?

48
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,405
- Oww...
- Granny...
- I don't get to have any fun.

49
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,875
- Why don't you show her your cave hmm...
 yeh, she could use a  nap.

50
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:10,450
- Boy, there's so much to tell you. You know a lot has happened since the last time I saw you.
- Not interested.

51
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,670
- But we fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age...
 didn't make sense but sure was exciting.

52
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,160
- We're getting rid of the crazy wretch, lets go...

53
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't
 just leave Sid'll be crushed. Whoa, whoa...

54
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:29,750
- Sorry cookie things are breaking apart back home.
- Nope, we're headed inland and Granny is just dead weight.

55
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:30,543
- See ya.

56
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:36,545
- And warn the community... 
she tends to wander.

57
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:39,563
- Well that explains a lot about Sid.

58
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,903
- Mum... dad do you have 
Granny's teeth, she can't find'em.

59
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:49,613
- Hey, can you chew this thing for me?

60
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,753
- Guys... where is everyone?
- I'll handle this.

61
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,520
Sid... your family was wiped out by an asteroid...
sorry.

62
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:06,875
- What...
- Ahem... what Diego is trying to say is... they left.

63
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,580
They only wanted to find you so
 you could take care of Granny.

64
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:15,525
- Oh c'mon, c'mon what kind of sick family
 would ditch their old Granny with someone...

65
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:27,445
 that's just  crazy... that's just... that's just... my family.
- At least you still have Granny, right buddy.

66
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:33,645
- Yeh... Granny. Granny...? Granny...?
 Wow, for an old girl she moves fast.

67
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,545
Granny...
- Granny... 
- Granny.

68
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:43,585
- Come out, come out wherever you are.
- C'mon Granny.

69
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:51,605
- Here Granny, Granny... Granny... Granny... I have  prunes for ya. Just the way ya like them... Blehh...

70
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:59,455
- I... don't want to see that...
Huh...? Oh no...

71
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:04,505
- What if you dad finds out, I'm not as tough as I  look.
- Wait, sshhtt... do you hear that?

72
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,118
- Go long...

73
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:20,958
- Hey look, there's Ethan.

74
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:24,470
- Yaay.... Ethan...
You go boy....

75
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:29,470
- Yehh...

76
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,408
- See... fun, no danger.

77
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,158
- Check me out.

78
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,950
- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not... fine.

79
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,890
I did not just do that, that was crazy.
- Nice...

80
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:03,408
- Isn't he perfect.
- Perfect... ehhh it, it's such a 
strong word, maybe adequate.

81
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,768
- Who are we stalking, is it Ethan?
- I bet it's Ethan.
- Ok... we know...

82
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,425
- What are you guys doing here?
- Manny told us to keep an eye on you.

83
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:16,408
- But not to let you see us under any circumstances.
- Ohh... Stupid, stupid, stupid... stupid...

84
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:21,745
- Ok, I'm going for it. Do I look ok?... Louis.

85
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,658
- Ok doesn't even begin to cover it.

86
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:30,055
- Oh Louis, you're the greatest friend ever....

87
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,708
- Thats me.

88
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:41,828
- Hi Ethan, my name's Peaches... what's yours?  Oooh, what am I doing. Ok just be cool, just be cool...

89
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,208
- Yep hoho, that's intense.

90
00:11:54,858 --> 00:12:01,115
- No, no, no... noooo....

91
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,545
- Gross, it's that weirdo that chills with possums.

92
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:16,545
- Whoa, what just happened?
- Oh no, Ethan I am so sorry I... Wow... even better looking up close, phenomenal, I mean...

93
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,955
- You have a twin sister?

94
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:22,445
- Am I interrupting something?
- Dad.

95
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:23,545
- Oh boy. Ok...
- Sorry, I just...

96
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,545
- Wait...
- No, you go...
- Move back, good...

97
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,645
- You, keep away from my daughter.
- Dad, nothing...

98
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,345
- And you, you're grounded.
- But I didn't...

99
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,545
- Grounded...
- Loser alert...

100
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:39,345
- Seriously, that's embarrassing...
- What a freak...

101
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,345
- Peaches.

102
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:48,100
Awww.... Peaches c'mon lets talk about this.

103
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:53,645
- How could you embarrass me in front of my friends.
- You deliberately went where you weren't supposed to.

104
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:59,145
- You can't control my life.
- I'm trying to protect you. That's what fathers do.

105
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,580
- Well... I wish you weren't my father.

106
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,570
- She's just upset honey. 

107
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,620
Peaches it's not the end of the world.

108
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,760
- Whoa, excuse me.
- I don't think that was you.

109
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,180
- Oh what was that?
- I don't know. Stay there... I'll come to you.

110
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,080
Ellie...
- Manny...

111
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,380
No...

112
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,880
- Dad.
- Peaches, get back.

113
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,480
- Hurry dad hurry, hurry.
- Manny.

114
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,780
- Diego...
- You never would have made it.

115
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:16,645
- Ellie, behind you.
- What's happening?

116
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,775
- Go to the land-bridge, 
you'll be safe on the other side.

117
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,745
- No Manny, no.
- I'll meet you there.

118
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:46,175
- Manny...... No...
- Ellie, you have to get out of here. Go! Go now!

119
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,455
- Mum...
- Get back... get back.

120
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,885
- Daddy....

121
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:38,475
- Stay alive. 
No matter how long it takes... I will find you.

122
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:45,280
- Mum, this is all my fault. If I'd just...
- Peaches this is not your fault, ok.

123
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,175
- What if I never see him again and
 the last thing we did was fight.

124
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,675
- Hey... your father is the toughest most 
stubborn mammoth that I have ever met.

125
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,875
He'll come back for us... that's a promise.

126
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,480
- C'mon, help me turn this thing around.

127
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:21,680
- Everyone, please settle down... don't panic.
- Wait mum, where's Louis, we have to find him.

128
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,335
- Ok... fast.

129
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,434
- They need me, we've gotta get back.

130
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:37,680
- Buddy this thing's too big to turn, 
the current's pulling us out.

131
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,845
- You know, my mother once told me that 
bad news was just good news in disguise.

132
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,680
- Was this before she abandoned you?

133
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:51,580
 - Yes it was... but the point being that even though things look bad there's a rainbow 'round  every corner.

134
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:55,450
It's nothing but smooth sailing ahead....

135
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,685
- Smooth sailing Sid?

136
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,870
- Louis... Louis...
- Louis...

137
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,470
- Weiner...
- Weiner...

138
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:13,870
- Weiner...
- Weiner...

139
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,570
- Louis where are you, come on we have to go.

140
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,370
- Louis.
- Peaches.

141
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:33,370
- Louis, you have to jump.
- No, no... save yourselves.

142
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,570
- We're not leaving without you 
- I'll think on this.

143
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,370
- Jump...

144
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:45,650
- This is why I travel underground.

145
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:57,270
- Thanks for coming back.
- What do you mean, you don't leave a friend behind.

146
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:02,895
- Great, lets go. 
That wall is going to keep moving and crush us.

147
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,850
We need to get to the land-bridge. 
Any questions?

148
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,620
- Ooh Ooh...
- Yes?

149
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,875
- When you drink water through your 
trunk does it taste like boogers?

150
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,670
- Ahhh.... no... well sometimes. 
Lets move.

151
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,412
- Just keep your eye on the horizon.
- I can't find the horizon.

152
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,770
- Whoa...
- Holy crab...!

153
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,175
Hold me...

154
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:07,470
If I don't make it, 
find me a wife and tell her I love her....

155
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,860
We made it. Come on ocean, is that the best 
you can do... am I right buddy?

156
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:41,770
Hey... there really is a rainbow around every corner.

157
00:19:58,127 --> 00:19:59,127
- Peaches.....!

158
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:09,658
You ok?
- I'm just so worried about my dad.

159
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,085
- Listen, we're gonna get to him. At this 
pace we'll stay ahead of the wall and we'll

160
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:19,578
make it to the land-bridge before you know it.
We're all gonna survive this.

161
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:27,778
Ok, maybe they won't but everyone 
else... totally fine.

162
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:50,985
- We're still heading away from home.

163
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:59,478
- Yeh but we survived and we still have each other. Things could be worse... right.

164
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:03,478
- For once, he's actually right.
We made it through storms and tidal-waves

165
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:08,478
and a vicious assortment of seafood...
what more can they hit us with?

166
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:09,810
Oww....

167
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:17,582
Hello.... What the...?
- Dag nabit, I'm trying to sleep.

168
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:21,795
- Granny... you're alive.
- And can we say how thrilled we are to see you.

169
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:25,795
- Hey fats, you wanna get me out of here....
- Whoo.

170
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,895
- Hey... pretend I'm a dessert... 
that should motivate you.

171
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,885
- I can't believe this... 
you slept through that storm.

172
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,495
- Aaahh, I slept through the comet
 that killed the unicorn.

173
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,705
Thanks for drawin' my bath Sidney.
- Granny, grab my paw.

174
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:48,705
- No way, this is my first bath in decades.

175
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:53,125
- There's your proof.

176
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,625
- Quick, somebody do something.

177
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:01,440
I got you Granny.
- Get off'a me.

178
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,375
- Granny...

179
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:12,725
- What are you peepin' toms all lookin' at? 
Lady can't take a bath in peace.

180
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,625
I'll wallop you with a wallop you...

181
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,725
- What's the life expectancy of a female sloth?

182
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:23,565
- Oh , she'll outlive us all you know that, right. Yeh, the spiteful ones live the longest.

183
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:46,425
- How big is this ocean?
- Water, water... everywhere. Not a drop to drink.

184
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:48,755
Uh, except maybe that drop. 

185
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:55,988
Hmm that's a little.... salty...

186
00:24:56,105 --> 00:25:02,765
- Precious... mummy's calling you... 
Precious... Precious sweety...

187
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:05,325
Hey lady... have you seen Precious?

188
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:10,825
- If you mean the imaginary or perhaps deceased pet that you keep searching for... No... I haven't.

189
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:16,955
- Guys, look... where there's birds there's land, right?
- Hey buddy, come here.

190
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:21,055
- No wait, wait... come back.

191
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:23,780
Come back.

192
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:45,465
- It's a huge bounty Capitan, four passengers 
ripe for the taking. One very smelly and one very plump.

193
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:53,665
- In my ocean... what a terrible turn
 of events. I love a terrible turn of events.

194
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,875
- Am I hallucinating or is that ice 
coming straight towards us.

195
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:11,470
- Yeh, yeh, it's coming. It sounds 
like there's animals on it.

196
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,470
- Yippee... we're being rescued, 
we're being rescued.

197
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,470
- I hear laughter.

198
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,470
- Oooh, must be a party cruise.

199
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,470
- Hey, they look fluffy.
- I get the big woolly one.

200
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,570
- Wow...

201
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,755
- Get ready to slice and dice boys.
- Knock it off Squint, wait for Captains' orders.

202
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:09,925
- Ahoy down there... how lucky are you. Do you know these waters are infested with pirates, right boys...

203
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:12,185
Glad we found you before they did.

204
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,270
Captain Gutt here to help.

205
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:20,260
- You know, that's a nice monkey.

206
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:28,570
- Look, we don't want any trouble. 
We just need to get back to the continent.

207
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:31,650
- The continent... that pile of rubble...

208
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,285
- My family's there so if you could just...

209
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:45,470
- Awww, your family... that is so sweet. I hope you said goodbye because there's no way back.

210
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:50,470
- Yes there is... don't you remember Captain. You can sail to Switchback Cove

211
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:54,570
 and catch a current back from there.
 Haha, steel-trap this noggin' is...

212
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,575
- Hahaha... thankyou Mr. Flynn.
- Oww.....

213
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:02,445
- See, I knew there was a way home.
- There is no home...

214
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,680
...there is only here and here, 
your ship belongs to me...

215
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,710
Battle Stations...!!

216
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,655
- Fly the Colours...!!

217
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:26,775
Now surrender your ship or face my fury.

218
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,410
- Or face your furry what?
- Not furry... fury.

219
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,215
Fire!

220
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,120
- Hit the mast... win a prize.

221
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:44,380
- Fire the starboard cannon.
- I... love... this... job...!

222
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,120
- Shira... fetch.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

223
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,470
- Aww, you almost made it.
- I don't fight girls.

224
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,780
- Huhhuh... I can see why.

225
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,455
- Belly-flop...

226
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,355
- Lets rumba tiny...

227
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,255
- Lights out big-fella...

228
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,015
- Hello.

229
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:29,756
- Hey buddy... welcome to the party.

230
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,480
- Lets see what kinda moves you got.
Dance little scrab-fish.

231
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:37,288
- Dodge the coconut ball...

232
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,750
- Happy days.... Oohmm...

233
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,780
Oohh... look at him.

234
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,480
Where's my booty, has anyone seen it?
- Flynn, it's right behind you.

235
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,480
- Where? Where's my booty. I can't see it.
- Yuk... it's all I can see.

236
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,480
- Ooh, this is a lovely vacation... 
best I've ever had.

237
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,550
- Mornin' sunshine... let me be the first to 
extend a hand of friendship.

238
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,550
- That's your foot.
- Hohoho... nothing gets by you, does it.

239
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,850
- What do you want?

240
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,550
- I bet you're feeling lost... scared... 
confused. Allow me to explain.

241
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:21,650
Help me out boys...
- Oooh, Captains' going to sing a shanty...

242
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,110
- Aye, aye,  Captain Gutts...

243
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,510
- Aww... jeeez...

244
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:20,750
- Kill them? Hoho, me? No, no... well,
 at least not this very large, useful mammoth.

245
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,720
- Hey, hands off.
- Anyway...

246
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,540
- We really should be leaving...

247
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,410
- We gotta get going...

248
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,650
- How I wish we could be staying...

249
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,220
- Oh please...

250
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,210
- Good shanty sir...

251
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:08,430
Captain Gutt... really? You know, I have a little paunch too but ahh... I wouldn't name myself after it.

252
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,410
- Thats funny... you're a funny guy. 
But that's not how I got my name...

253
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,410
These... got me my name.

254
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:23,410
- I don't get it.
- No? Ok, let me give you a visual aid. 
I just gently press here...

255
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,885
- It tickles.
- And go down like this...

256
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,560
- And then your innards become your outs...

257
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,885
- Um, I still don't get it.

258
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:43,650
- Look, as much as I'm tempted to join a monkey, the Easter Bunny and a giant bag of pudding... I'll pass.

259
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:46,670
No one's gonna stop me getting back to my family.

260
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,465
- I'm gonna lambado your liver buddy.

261
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,340
Let me at him.

262
00:32:53,410 --> 00:33:00,685
- That family is going to be the death of you.
First mate, jettison the dead weight.

263
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,410
- Aye, aye sir. Prepare the plank
- Prepare the plank.

264
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,410
- Preparing the plank.

265
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,410
- Heh...
- Ow.... What, you want me to walk into the water?

266
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,410
I can't because I ate less than 20 mins
 ago and you know the rule.

267
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,550
- That's a myth...
- Oh ok, as long as it's safe.

268
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,410
- Wait...
- Thank goodness.

269
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,350
- Dump the wench too...

270
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,710
Ladies first.
- Such a nice boy.

271
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,640
Why can't you be more like him Sidney.
- Granny... no, wait...

272
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:38,525
- Manny... get me to the vine.

273
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:41,135
- Yeh, yeh, got it.

274
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:48,475
- Hmmhmmhmm... hmhmhm. you'all
 got some ugly goldfish.

275
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:51,575
- C'mon, a little bit more.

276
00:33:58,265 --> 00:33:59,575
- Hmm? No...!

277
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:06,575
- Take that mammoth.
- Go on Manny, kick that monkeys' butt...

278
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:13,475
- Look at you, 11 tons of land-lubber flubber.
- Hey, I'm not fat... I'm poomfy...

279
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:18,485
- Too bad tubby... I could have used you.
- Ain't gonna happen Captain.

280
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:29,476
- I got you Granny.
- Giddee up, lets go.

281
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:37,685
- Can anyone have bounties.

282
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:45,325
- No, my bounty...

283
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:05,485
- They sank our battleship, what are 
we gonna do... we're all gonna drown.

284
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:11,285
- You're a sea creature you idiot.
- Oh... Quite... sir.

285
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,485
- Should I flag a white Captain?
- No...!

286
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:17,485
- Wait, what about Shira?
- What about her.

287
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:22,885
- Yeh, what about her.
- Anyone else want to play Captain?

288
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,485
...Good.

289
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:26,485
- Now come on blubber-brain, swim.

290
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:34,071
- Hey... Gutt... Flynn... anyone there?
- Here, grab hold.

291
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:38,421
- No, go away... I'd rather drown.
- Whatever the lady wants.

292
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,851
- I said I didn't need your help.
- Your welcome...

293
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:49,851
wassup... care to join our scurvy crew.

294
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:55,335
- Two sloths, a mammoth and a sabre? 
You guys are like the start of a bad joke.

295
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:59,485
- And we saved you... that makes 
you the punchline... kitty.

296
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:03,585
- Don't... call me kitty.
- Ok I won't...

297
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,673
...kitty.

298
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,551
- If they kiss I'm gonna puke.
- What? Wait... no...

299
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,085
- I don't think we're ever going to get there?
- Maybe we should rest for a few hours.

300
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,480
- Night Alex...

301
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,655
- I miss you dad.

302
00:36:54,895 --> 00:36:57,575
- Well that's something you don't see everyday.

303
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,875
- Ethan... Hi....

304
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,075
Meant... to do that.

305
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:09,775
- I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.
- What... No... This just helps me think.

306
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:13,775
It gets the blood to the old noggin' 
and away from the old... whatever.

307
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:18,875
- Ahh... ok, that's a little weird.

308
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:31,675
So, how you doing... you know, with all of this.
- Honestly, a little scared. Ok, a lot scared. 

309
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:39,475
Everything we knew is gone.
- Yeah, I was pretty scared too. I mean, not scared... you know, like concerned.

310
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:46,475
Hey, um, do you want to walk with me tomorrow? Try and get our minds off all of this stuff.
- You want to walk with me.

311
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:53,775
- Well, you did almost flatten me this morning so I figure it can't really go worse than that, right.
- Yeah...

312
00:37:54,155 --> 00:38:01,875
- Oh, just one thing, totally no big deal but... you might want to lose the mohawk.
- Louis... yeah, sure... not a problem.

313
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:09,875
Aahhh... wow...
- Someone looks happy.

314
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:18,775
- Ethan's great isn't he.
- Baby, I know you like this one but just don't let anyone change who you are, ok.

315
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:19,675
- I know.

316
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:24,550
- You coming up?

317
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:33,755
- I think I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
- Ok... night baby.

318
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:38,555
- Night mum... Night dad.

319
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:57,555
- Hey, chew this sandwich for me.
- Granny, why didn't our family want us? 
What's wrong with us.

320
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:02,015
- Aaah, they think that we're screw-ups 
and we can't do anything right.

321
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,195
- It's a rat...

322
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:14,695
- Screw-up.
- Oh Sid...

323
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:21,990
- Never make home on this thing.
- Huh well, maybe you should have thought of that before you capsized our 'berg genius.

324
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,325
- Yeh, trying to escape.
- Wimp...

325
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:24,325
- Whiner...
- Crybaby...

326
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:26,945
- Land...!
- Yeah, land... Wait. What?

327
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,455
- Not her... there!

328
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,976
Land!!

329
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,765
Everyone paddle, paddle.

330
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:04,855
- Food... Aww, I miss you so much. 
Look at me, I've wasted away.

331
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:15,785
- Ok, snack time's over. We gotta build a raft.
- Manny...

332
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:21,855
- Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.
- Go get her, she can help us get back.

333
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:22,475
- Shira...

334
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:47,275
- Gotcha...

335
00:40:49,275 --> 00:40:49,875
Ohh....

336
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:59,875
- Let go of me.
- Where do you think you're going?

337
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:01,126
Whoa....

338
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:06,676
Switchback Cove... it's the way home.

339
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:08,876
Oh... no...

340
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:14,456
- You call this a ship you miserable runts?
- Yeh you little runts... get to work.

341
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,460
- Faster you worthless worthy sons of 
sorry excuses for shark-bait weevils..

342
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,460
- What did he say?
- I dunno...

343
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:27,480
- Now get this chunk of ice seaworthy by
sundown or I will keel-haul the lot of you.

344
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,480
- So, what do you think.
- Two words... Anger... Management.

345
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,410
- I'm talking about the current... 
Diego's right, we've found a way home.

346
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,470
- Yes that's great... too bad 
we don't have a ship.

347
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,680
- Sure we do, it's right there.

348
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,480
- Well, that's a flawless plan. You
 want to pirate a pirate ship from pirates.

349
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:55,780
- It pains me to say this but our prisoner
 has a point.

350
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,310
- Yeh well...
- Guys... sssshh... the trees have ears.

351
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,680
- Wait a minute, maybe we can 
help each other.

352
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:26,850
Hey little fellas. Hey, come on out. No, no, no. no, it's ok, we're not gonna hurt ya.

353
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:32,480
How about you and us against 
the pirates, huh?

354
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,480
You got no idea what I'm saying do ya.
 Ok, ahh... ship me want.

355
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:44,880
- Yeah, nice try jungle-jim.
- Yeh go ahead make fun ok, he got it.

356
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Oh... Ahh... thankyou.

357
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:53,896
- Ah, may I try?
- Yeh, knock yourself out.

358
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,680
- Ok... watch this.

359
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:02,220
Sick sloths sip broth... 
Sick sloths sip broth...

360
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,875
- That they got...?

361
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,840
- Yep... they're ready.
- Great, we'll free your buddies we can all work together to kick a little pirate booty.

362
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,650
- Easy kitty... water... you need it.

363
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,420
- I don't need anything from you.

364
00:44:08,435 --> 00:44:14,920
- Fine, die of thirst that'll really show me.
- Wait. I'll take it... thankyou.

365
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,420
- You know, you have a way of saying thankyou that makes it sound like drop dead.

366
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,575
- It's a gift. You're pretty soft... for a sabre.

367
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,925
- Excuse me... I am not soft ok, I happen 
to be a remorseless assassin.

368
00:44:28,105 --> 00:44:32,885
- Diego-poo... hey, I made you another 
coral necklace... he keeps losing them.

369
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,520
- Yeah, I think I get why I'm starting 
to get why you're not in a pack.

370
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:41,520
- Listen I chose to leave my pack, alright.

371
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,520
- Congratulations warrior princess, so did I.
- Really?

372
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,520
- What?
- Nothing... I just... I know how hard that is... walking away from everthing you know.

373
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,420
- Oh great... what, are we going
 to braid each others fur now?

374
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,520
- Funny, really funny. Can I tell you 
the difference between you and me.

375
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,920
- I won't still be wearing their necklace.

376
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:04,380
- No. We both might have wanted
 out of our pack-life but at least

377
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,780
I didn't trade one pack-life for 
another. I got something more.

378
00:45:08,383 --> 00:45:12,156
- Oh yeah... what's that.
- A herd...
- What's the difference?

379
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,555
- We have each others backs.
- Gutt has my back. I'm his First Mate.

380
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,555
- Really? Because I don't see Gutt
 sending out any search parties for you.

381
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:30,145
- You know you won't beat him. Your big furry friend over there, he has no idea what he's up against.
- Yeah, but neither does Gutt.

382
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:32,775
- With the vines, don't let go until 
we're all on board.

383
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,645
Ok, we need precision timing from 
everyone to get that ship.

384
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:38,865
Half-pint, you've got your end covered, right.

385
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:45,245
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

386
00:45:45,845 --> 00:45:47,445
Diego...
- I'll free his little friends.

387
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:50,445
- Sid and Granny...
- Sir, untie the ship... sir.

388
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:56,545
- Right, unwind the vines... don't let go until we're all on board. We're relying on you Sid... you got that.

389
00:45:56,555 --> 00:46:02,155
- Yes sir, totally focussed sir.
- Don't worry, it'll be easy since we 
don't have to guard Shira anymore.

390
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:08,565
- We need to move... now.

391
00:46:09,255 --> 00:46:12,455
- Batten down the hatches. 
Brad, hoist the anchor.

392
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:15,885
And Gumpta, fly the colours.
- More sports, Captain.

393
00:46:17,105 --> 00:46:21,255
- We'll settin' sail for vengance lads.
- Whoo... I love vengance.

394
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:28,355
- Captain...
- Shira... Oh what a relief, I'd thought we'd lost you.

395
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,185
- The mammoth, he washed ashore with me... He's...

396
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:37,225
- What, he's here... Did you sink your 
fangs into him? Did he beg for his life?

397
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,975
- No, the sabre took me down.

398
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:49,145
- Whaa... you're a failure. I need warriors and all I have are kitty cats and bunny rabbits
- And a seal and a kangaroo...

399
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:58,865
- You take the sabre down or you
 die trying... no excuses.
- Yes Captain.

400
00:46:59,876 --> 00:47:03,965
- Mr. Squint...
- Aye sir...
- You're First Mate now.

401
00:47:04,465 --> 00:47:12,465
- Yohoho and a bottle of who-with-me Captain. Out of my way sailor... you answer to me now.
- Gutt listen... he's coming for the...

402
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:13,150
- Huh....?

403
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,150
- Grab your weapons mates.

404
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,450
- Yes...
- A spoon Flynn?
- No...

405
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,170
- Follow me...

406
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,655
- Let me at him...
- Yeh, it's their turn now...

407
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:15,610
- Guys, it's not necessary really.
 And yeah, I love you too. Yeah...

408
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,510
- Get to the ship, don't screw up. 
Get to the ship, don't screw up...

409
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,550
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

410
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,550
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

411
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:26,815
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let... oh, yummo.

412
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:35,750
- Sid, no, it's a lolus berry, it'll paralyse you.
- Oh please... I know my berries.

413
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:45,850
- Don't.... swallow...
- I'm fine, if there's one thing I know 
it's berries... Oh oh...

414
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,650
- Yeah, finally... 

415
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,850
Who's the Easter bunny now.

416
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,990
- It worked... he bought it.
- C'mon.

417
00:49:31,175 --> 00:49:35,575
- Oh no... it's been a diversion.
- Oh no... I'm having a blast.

418
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,985
- No pinhead, they're stealing my ship.

419
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:50,450
- One thing Sid... you couldn't do one thing. Look at you... Sid can you hear me.
- Bye bye...

420
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,320
- Say something buddy.
- Whoa...

421
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,125
lets go...

422
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,805
- The ship... c'mon, we've got
 to catch it before it hits open water.

423
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:11,365
Sorry, I'll hold you higher... Sorry... Sorry...

424
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,770
- Say adieu mammoth.... 
- Owww...

425
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,320
- Sorry buddy.

426
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,790
I'm coming Sid.

427
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,645
I gotya... I gotcha... gotcha...

428
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,970
- I'm coming for you mammoth.

429
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,350
- Diego, c'mon...

430
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,670
C'mon move it.

431
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,650
- Why are you doing this?
- You don't understand I don't have a choice.

432
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,750
- You don't have to live this was Shira... you'll be safe with us. We take care of each other.

433
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:31,750
- Diego... I can't hold on much longer....

434
00:51:33,776 --> 00:51:34,550
Diego...

435
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,875
- Come with us... come with me.

436
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,340
- What are you doing?
- I've got your back...

437
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:20,450
- So long banana breath... 
Thanks for the ship.

438
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,770
- Oh no, he's gone forever... Oh, there he is.

439
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,940
- Shore leave's over. Get your sorry 
carcasses on board... now.

440
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,150
- Gutt, I can explain.

441
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:25,650
- When this ends, I'll have a tiger skin 
hanging on my wall. I don't care who's... 

442
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:35,845
That mammoth has taken my ship, 
my bounty and now the loyalty of my crew.

443
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:40,890
I will destroy him and everything he loves.

444
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,280
- Wait for it... wait for it....

445
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,775
That was awesome.

446
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,150
- Can I ask you guys something. 
How are you both so happy,

447
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,650
doesn't it weigh on you that 
the world might be ending...

448
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:54,125
- Can I tell him our secret?... Come here... come here... we're very, very stupid.

449
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:06,875
- But still, you're not a tinsy bit concerned 
about... I don't know, say imminent death!
- Beep...

450
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,555
- I'm gonna go find Peaches.

451
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:18,955
- Hey guys over here, c'mon it's a 
short-cut. You're gonna love this...

452
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,205
- C'mon guys, lets have some fun...

453
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,970
- Oooh, wow, this is so cool... 
it's like we're upside down.
- That is amazing...

454
00:55:27,886 --> 00:55:28,750
- Echo...

455
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:32,770
- Huh...?

456
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:38,750
- Too bad your mohawk friend isn't here, huh.
- You're not really friends with him are you?

457
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,940
- Yeah, come clean Peaches.
- Are you friends with that awful little rodent or not?

458
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:50,610
- I mean Louis and I we hang out... or whatever. But no, we're not really friend friends.

459
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:55,130
- Not friends...
- Louis... I...

460
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,660
- Busted...

461
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,310
- I mean...

462
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,980
- Good to know.
- Louis... wait.

463
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:05,260
- Oww...

464
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:12,540
- Haha... he even runs away like a loser.
- Whoa Peaches, don't stress... you're with us now.

465
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,540
- Yeah, stress is so... stressful.
- Yeah girl, if you want to stress it out like that...

466
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,340
- Err, guys... we should get outta here.
- Are you kidding, this is epic.

467
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:32,850
- Go, go, go...

468
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:48,880
- Yeah...
- How sick was that... Yo, that was insane. Hey Peach loosen up... have some fun.

469
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:54,550
- Fun...! You call that fun... I'm outta here, 
- Come on, I mean... do you really want to go back

470
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:58,670
to hanging out with a weird mole hog for 
a week than getting along with us.

471
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,440
- I mean, it's bad enough that your 
family's half possum...

472
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:05,440
- Bad enough...? There's nothing bad 
about being part of my family.

473
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,770
I make like hanging by my tail and if you genious's are normal the species is going to end up extinct.

474
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,850
- Ah, yeah. Well your species is going to be extinct first.
- Haha, Burrrnnn....

475
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,770
- We're the same species genious.
- What.... double burrrnnn.

476
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:46,550
- Hey, I can wriggle my toe again... the important one... the little piggy who went to market.

477
00:57:46,878 --> 00:57:52,550
Wait, I'm talking again. Oh, I had so many things trapped inside of me that I couldn't say

478
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:58,750
... like "Hey, I'm not dead..." 
and why'd it hurt me in the eye but not in an ear.

479
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,450
 - I'll push him overboard, you guys 
say it was an accident.

480
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:02,445
- And why do males have nipples?

481
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,450
- I'm in... how about you Diego.

482
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:12,770
 Diego... Hey relax buddy Captain Crazy and his floating petting zoo are history. C'mon, we're finally heading home.

483
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:17,750
- I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't eat, can't sleep... Maybe I'm coming down with something.

484
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:24,750
- Hohohoo... I know what you've got.... The "L" word.
- Yeah, leprosy.

485
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:32,485
- No Sid, no. It's four letters, starts with L ends with E.
- Ahha, lice...

486
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:38,750
- No... Diego, my friend, is in love.
- Oh yeah... Love.

487
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:44,750
- You mean with the pirate?... No.
- Oh, Shira's gotten under your skin, c'mon admit it.

488
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,850
- A rugged sabre like you...
- A more rugged sabre like her...

489
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:57,975
- No, no, no, you guys are dead wrong.
- Denial is the clincher... You're in love pussycat.

490
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:03,175
- Diego and Shira sitting in a tree,
K.I.S.S.I.N.G...
- K.I.S.S.I.N.G...

491
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,705
- Real mature guys... real mature.

492
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,430
- Diego.....

493
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,880
- Diego.....
- Shira....?

494
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:30,775
- I wanted to come with you...
- She's beautiful...

495
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:38,730
- Sid... I adore a sloth who cares 
nothing about personal hygiene.
- That's me... baby.

496
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:47,830
- Granny... come to me Granny...
- Well... hello.

497
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:56,670
- The wrinklier the resin... the sweeter the fruit.
- Woo... Granny like it... Granny like it very much.

498
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,430
- Huh...? Guys, guys, 
aren't you paying... attention...

499
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,730
- Manny, are you there?
- Ellie...?
- We're over here Manny.

500
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:12,660
- This way daddy. I really need you.
- I know honey, stay there...

501
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,430
...I'm coming.

502
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,430
- You were right Manny, 
you're always right.

503
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:24,230
- No, no, look I... 
Wait a minute, Ellie would never say that.

504
01:00:24,535 --> 01:00:29,395
- Manny... Manny...
- No, no, they're not real... they're monsters.

505
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:36,125
They're Sirens, don't listen to them.
 <i>"Who can take the sunrise.... sprinkle it with dew"<i>

506
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:43,270
No, they may look real but they're not, 
they're going to destroy the ship.

507
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:46,705
- Come my tiger, swim with me.

508
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:56,995
- Sid.... I have a snack for you, uhuhbleh....
- And she cooks too.

509
01:00:58,255 --> 01:00:59,675
- Sid... no!

510
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:18,575
- Why are we kissing?
- Um... because cruises are romantic.

511
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,875
- Whoo... five for seconds and we
 would've been goners.

512
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,975
- Call me...
- MmmMmm, Uhuhh...

513
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:46,665
- Yoohoo...

514
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:43,425
- Here girl... here Precious...
- She thinks she finally found her pet.

515
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:45,525
- Good girl...

516
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:50,825
- Here you go...
- Look Granny, can't you throw imaginary 
food to your imaginary pet?

517
01:02:52,425 --> 01:02:56,725
- Enough already... 
We need to keep a lookout for home.

518
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:59,865
- Ignore them Precious... I do.

519
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,880
- Nah, can't take your eyes off her for one minute.

520
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,470
- Nope, it's like having a child... 

521
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,270
...only without any of the joy.

522
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,550
- Hey brains trust... brace for impact.
- Huh...?

523
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:29,455
Guys... look, we're almost home.
- Buddy, I never doubted ya.

524
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:34,660
- Me either. Well... except for the six or 
seven times I thought you were gonna die.

525
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,695
- What's wrong sweetheart?
- You ever say something you 
knew you couldn't take back.

526
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,880
 - Is this about Louis?
 - I messed up so bad, mum.

527
01:03:56,895 --> 01:04:03,210
- It's ok, it happens. Cute boys can 
whiplash a brain... no doubt about that.

528
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:08,890
- But Ethan was the wrong guy.
- And you figured it out. You'll know what to say to Louis.

529
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,490
- What's going on?

530
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:25,190
- The land-bridge... it's gone.

531
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,090
- We're trapped.

532
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,190
- But we were supposed to meet dad here... 
What are we gonna do?

533
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:52,750
- Ellie... Peaches...

534
01:04:56,655 --> 01:05:01,060
- Oh no, the land-bridge.
- But, if it's gone then how are we gonna...

535
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:03,690
- Sid...
- No... they have to be on the other side.

536
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:12,190
- Manny, there is no other side.
- They have to be here. Ellie... Peaches... I'm here...

537
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:16,790
Please, she's gotta be here.

538
01:05:28,015 --> 01:05:29,490
Wait, wait, did you hear that?
- Manny...

539
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:31,860
- No, I... I heard something. I heard it.

540
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,150
- Is that...?
- Peaches... There she is.

541
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,690
- Dad...
- We're coming sweetie. Don't move.

542
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:43,450
- Daddy...
- Peaches...

543
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,780
- Welcome home daddy...
- Let go of me.

544
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:52,350
- What the odds, we we're just talking about you.

545
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:57,750
You like the new ship... 
I call her Sweet Revenge.

546
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:02,150
- And look here, 
we've got ze catch-de-jour.

547
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:07,770
- Ellie.
- I'm alright. Let my daughter go.

548
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:12,750
- It's ok, he wants me... 
and he's gonna get me.

549
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:23,150
- Sacrificing yourself for your daughter... 
how touching... how predictable.

550
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,750
Now come and get her.

551
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:35,850
- G'day mate...
- You remember us... we're the bad guys.

552
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:43,650
- Alright, let them go.
- I don't think so. You destroyed everything I had...

553
01:06:43,665 --> 01:06:45,850
I'm just returning the favour.

554
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,125
- No...!

555
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:53,465
- I warned you.
- Stop...!!

556
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:59,665
Let... the mammoth... go...
- Weiner?...

557
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,805
- Hoho... ohoh... who brought the muscle to the party?
- Louis don't.

558
01:07:04,865 --> 01:07:09,665
- What's he doing, he's gonna get himself killed.
- It's ok, I can handle him.

559
01:07:09,675 --> 01:07:16,865
- How cute, a hero... lets see what bravery gets you. Gupta, give the lad your weapon.

560
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,110
- Nice knowing you kid.

561
01:07:32,455 --> 01:07:34,675
- Lets dance, hero.

562
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:51,475
Ooowwww...!!

563
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,885
Don't stand there like barnacles... get him.

564
01:07:58,025 --> 01:07:59,855
- Oi, going somewhere mate?

565
01:08:05,685 --> 01:08:06,585
- Let me at him.

566
01:08:11,575 --> 01:08:12,795
- Any last words?

567
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:17,880
- Precious....
- Will you stop with the Precious...

568
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,950
- Mummy...

569
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:28,385
- Well, I guess we showed them... huh.
- Precious...

570
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,255
- That's your pet...

571
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:36,585
Maybe that crazy old bat isn't that crazy after all.

572
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,385
Nope.... she's nuts

573
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:46,485
- You waiting for a formal invitation fancy pants... get in.
- I'm gonna regret this.

574
01:08:49,385 --> 01:08:52,685
- Flags away...
- Ow...

575
01:08:57,185 --> 01:08:59,145
- Don't be a scaredy cat.

576
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:13,385
- Urrkk... thats smells worse than me.
- Precious, set your nimbus 35 degrees north. 
Granny's done runnin'.

577
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:16,785
- Back off.
- It's ok... I'm on your side.

578
01:09:18,015 --> 01:09:19,985
- I knew you were a traitor.

579
01:09:20,185 --> 01:09:24,165
- Oh your little bunny nose wiggles 
in the cutist way when you're mad.

580
01:09:25,385 --> 01:09:30,385
- Your nine lives are over kitty...
- Silly rabbit... piracy doesn't pay.

581
01:09:30,395 --> 01:09:31,885
- Hey, that sounds cool.

582
01:09:39,185 --> 01:09:43,985
- Yuk, anyone have a body way?
- Suck it up buttercup... how's it looking?

583
01:09:46,385 --> 01:09:47,835
- Not good Granny, sir.

584
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:52,485
- Oww...
- Full steam ahead. Dive, dive, dive...

585
01:09:59,185 --> 01:10:00,555
- Fire...!!

586
01:10:02,855 --> 01:10:04,955
- Oh yeah baby...

587
01:10:08,255 --> 01:10:12,645
- Ooh... that feels so good. 
Oh thankyou Mr. Whale.

588
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:14,875
- Hi Manny...
- Sid..?!

589
01:10:14,883 --> 01:10:16,075
- Help...

590
01:10:19,245 --> 01:10:20,125
- Mum...

591
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:24,875
- No Peaches I'll get your mother, you stay there.
- Hurry Manny...

592
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:32,895
- Payback time...
- Manny...

593
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:34,675
- Ellie...
- I've got this dad.

594
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:39,475
- Peaches... No... It's too dangerous.
- Not if your half-possum.

595
01:10:55,445 --> 01:10:59,445
- She did it... my daughter's all grownup.

596
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:05,955
- That's my girl...

597
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:12,885
We need to get out of here...
- Go, go, I'm right behind ya.

598
01:11:13,255 --> 01:11:17,645
- No... I'm right behind you
- Dad...

599
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:27,645
No...

600
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,445
- There's nowhere to run Manny.

601
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:47,845
You know this ocean isn't big 
enough for the both of us.

602
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:52,775
- Don't worry, you won't take 
up much space once I flatten you.

603
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:11,845
- Told ya chubby, you shouldn't have 
messed with the master of the seas

604
01:12:12,445 --> 01:12:16,445
- You know, sometimes... it 
pays to weigh eleven tons...

605
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:20,675
- Nooo....
- Bon voyage.... big boy.

606
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:31,545
- Did somebody hail a whale?

607
01:12:35,045 --> 01:12:37,665
- So, you must be Precious.

608
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:44,225
- Mission accomplished Granny.
- Ha... who says old ladies can't drive.

609
01:12:55,125 --> 01:13:01,860
- Oh Captain Gutt...
- That's me...

610
01:13:01,865 --> 01:13:06,845
- Let's rule the seas together...
- Aye, aye...

611
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,845
Nooo.... let me out...

612
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:21,125
- Dad...

613
01:13:23,055 --> 01:13:24,755
- How's that for an entrance.

614
01:13:30,485 --> 01:13:31,485
- Dad...

615
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,785
- Manny...

616
01:13:37,485 --> 01:13:40,585
I told you your father would never give up on us.
- Never...

617
01:13:44,485 --> 01:13:47,585
- Hey, I actually... Ow...

618
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:54,345
- You know Sid, you're not such a screw-up.
- Aahh... really?

619
01:13:54,385 --> 01:13:56,485
- Really!! You're a hero.

620
01:13:58,285 --> 01:14:00,785
- You too Granny.
- Thanks lady.

621
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:06,585
- So, still want me on your scurvy crew?
- You bet, welcome to our herd.

622
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:14,685
- Hey you... I can't believe you 
did that. Thankyou.

623
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:19,585
- Well, someone once told me that no matter what... you never leave a friend behind.

624
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:25,385
- All this sweetness is gonna rot my teeth... 
if I had any.

625
01:14:30,285 --> 01:14:33,785
- Our home is gone... 
Where do we go now?

626
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:51,885
- Aww... Mumma loves you too...

627
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:29,385
- Whoa... I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah...

628
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,385
- Excuse me...
- Dad...

629
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:36,895
- When you two get off this ship 
I expect you both to... have fun. 
- Huh...?

630
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,345
- You're a brave kid weiner.
- Wait...? What...?

631
01:15:39,348 --> 01:15:44,875
- You heard me... You two should go out and... and explore. Go where the day takes you...

632
01:15:45,345 --> 01:15:50,200
but be back before sunset.
- An hour after sunset...?

633
01:15:50,205 --> 01:15:55,235
- Yeh, not a minute later...
- Deal... I love you dad.

634
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:02,845
- Hey, ok if we hang with you guys?
- Sure.

635
01:16:03,345 --> 01:16:08,645
- I always liked him... Louis the hero. 
Brave-a-licious...

636
01:16:10,345 --> 01:16:14,545
- She's not my little girl anymore.
- And you're both going to be just fine.

637
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:15,675
- I know.

638
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:26,385
- You know Sidney, you've got yourself 
a nice family here... A real family.
- Yeh... I'm pretty lucky.

639
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,745
- Here, chew this kiwi for me.
- Na ahh, never again... Tadahhh...

640
01:16:31,885 --> 01:16:32,485
- Huh....

641
01:16:37,145 --> 01:16:37,935
- Ahhh...

642
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,675
- Hey, sailor...
- Whoa...

643
01:17:21,215 --> 01:17:23,420
- Welcome... brother.

644
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,690
Behold... 

645
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,690
...Scratlantis...

646
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,220
No...  

647
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:31,090
Stop...

648
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:35,055
Brother, rise above this base desire

649
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,055
...be more than a rodent...
