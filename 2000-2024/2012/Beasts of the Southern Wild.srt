1
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,584
<i>All the time, everywhere...</i>

2
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,752
<i>...everything's hearts
are beating and squirting...</i>

3
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,422
<i>...and talking to each other
the ways I can't understand.</i>

4
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,794
<i>Most of the time,
they probably be saying:</i>

5
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,940
<i>"I'm hungry. I gotta poop."</i>

6
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,001
<i>But sometimes
they be talking in codes.</i>

7
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,045
Get out the way.

8
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,452
Get your pants on, man.

9
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,950
Feed up time! Feed up!

10
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,458
Feed up time!

11
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,209
Share with the dog.

12
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,240
Ain't that ugly over there?

13
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,346
We got the prettiest place on earth.

14
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>Daddy says, up above the levee...</i>

15
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,991
<i>...on the dry side,
they're afraid of the water...</i>

16
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,566
<i>...like a bunch of babies.</i>

17
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,437
<i>They built the wall that cuts us off.</i>

18
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,938
<i>They think we all gonna drown
down here.</i>

19
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,141
<i>But we ain't going nowhere.</i>

20
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:18,153
<i>The Bathtub has got more holidays
than the whole rest of the world.</i>

21
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,888
Yeah!

22
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,591
Yeah!

23
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,528
Yeah!

24
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,540
Yeah! Yeah!

25
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,690
<i>Daddy always saying...</i>

26
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,262
<i>...that up in the dry world,
they got none of what we got.</i>

27
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,328
<i>They only got holidays once a year.</i>

28
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,271
All babies in the race,
come up to the starting line.

29
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,341
<i>They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers.</i>

30
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,150
<i>They got their babies stuck in carriages.</i>

31
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,625
<i>And chicken on sticks
and all that kind of stuff.</i>

32
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,966
<i>One day, the storm is gonna blow...</i>

33
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,808
<i>...the ground is gonna sink
and the water is gonna rise up so high...</i>

34
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,544
<i>...there ain't gonna be no Bathtub.
Just a whole bunch of water.</i>

35
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,190
Yeah!

36
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,361
<i>But me and my daddy, we stay right here.</i>

37
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,025
<i>Web who the earth is for.</i>

38
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,110
Meat. Meat, meat, meat.

39
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,457
Every animal is made out of meat.

40
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm meat. Y'all asses meat.

41
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,963
Everything is part of the buffet
of the universe.

42
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,032
This here is an aurochs...

43
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,268
...a fierce, mean creature
that walked the face of the earth...

44
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,471
...back when we all lived in the caves.

45
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,446
And they would gobble them
cave-babies down...

46
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,211
...right in front of the cave-baby parents.

47
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,118
And the cavemans,
they couldn't even do nothing about it...

48
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,089
...because they was too poor
and too small.

49
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,489
Who up in here think
that the cavemans...

50
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,655
...was sitting around crying
like a bunch of pussies?

51
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,236
Y'all better think about that
because any day now...

52
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,397
...fabric of the universe
is coming unraveled.

53
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,806
Ice caps gonna melt,
water is gonna rise...

54
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,539
...and everything south of the levee
is going under.

55
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,342
Y'all better learn how to survive now.

56
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,595
<i>Way back in the day...</i>

57
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,357
<i>...the aurochs was king of the world.</i>

58
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:55,532
<i>If it wasn't for giant snowballs
and the Iced Age...</i>

59
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,606
<i>...I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy.</i>

60
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,107
<i>I would just be breakfast.</i>

61
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,576
Daddy?

62
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,112
Feed up time.

63
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,071
Feed up time.

64
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,319
Daddy?

65
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,150
Daddy!

66
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:20,583
<i>Kids that got no mama,
no daddy and nobody...</i>

67
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,126
<i>...they gots to live in the woods...</i>

68
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,322
<i>...and eat grass and steal underpants.</i>

69
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,336
<i>If Daddy don't get back soon...</i>

70
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,670
<i>...it's gonna be time for me
to start eating my pets.</i>

71
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,971
Daddy?

72
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,140
Daddy?

73
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,250
- That taste good?
- Yeah.

74
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,899
Hey, my baby, you need a ride?

75
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,469
No, my dad come and pick me up.

76
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,970
Well, what about some food
or something, darling?

77
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,699
You hungry?

78
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,937
All right, then. Well, suit yourself, okay?

79
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,146
<i>Everything we still got from Mama,
I keep in my house.</i>

80
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,392
<i>Daddy says the first time
she looked at me...</i>

81
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,893
<i>...it made her heart beat so big...</i>

82
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,361
<i>...that she thought it would blow up.</i>

83
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,865
<i>That's why she swam away.</i>

84
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,741
<i>Hi, my sweet baby.</i>

85
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,076
Hi, Mama.

86
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,591
<i>Hushpuppy, what you doing there?</i>

87
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,775
<i>You being good like I taught you?</i>

88
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,707
Yes, Mama.

89
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,600
<i>You're good</i>

90
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,800
<i>You make me happy</i>

91
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,743
<i>You're good</i>

92
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,041
<i>You make me happy</i>

93
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,411
<i>You're good</i>

94
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,143
That's pretty, Ma.

95
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,288
<i>You're pretty, Hushpuppy.</i>

96
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,385
Get out of my way, you fat animal.

97
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,855
Daddy.

98
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892
Daddy! Daddy!

99
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,576
I learned lots of things
while you were gone.

100
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:05,437
If I drink all this here,
I can burp like a man.

101
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,927
- Why are you wearing that dress?
- Leave me alone, man.

102
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,026
You wearing a bracelet too?

103
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,672
Go to your house.
You wouldn't understand.

104
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,836
- I want to come to your house.
- Get out of here!

105
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,380
- I want to come...
- Go ahead!

106
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,033
Get down from there. Get over here.

107
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,313
Feed up time! Come on, man! Feed up!

108
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,807
Boss lady!

109
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,142
Hushpuppy, where you at?

110
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,080
Where you at, boss lady?

111
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,380
<i>If Daddy kill me,
I ain't gonna be forgotten.</i>

112
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,290
<i>I'm recording my story
for the scientists in the future.</i>

113
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,358
<i>In a million years,
when kids go to school...</i>

114
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,002
<i>...they're gonna know, once,
there was a Hushpuppy...</i>

115
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,934
<i>...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.</i>

116
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,238
Hushpuppy!

117
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,211
Where you at, man?

118
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,082
HUSHPUPPY!

119
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,742
Boss lady, goddamn it!

120
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,291
Come here!

121
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,056
Don't you run away from me!

122
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,221
I swear to God!

123
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,298
Get your ass back here!

124
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,270
I'm tearing off!

125
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,136
I'm tearing off just like my mama!

126
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,609
I'm gonna bust your ass! Come here!

127
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,213
- Come here!
- No!

128
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,280
See what happen.
See what happen to you.

129
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,473
No!

130
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,860
I got to worry about you all the damn time!
You killing me!

131
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,059
You killing me!

132
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,161
Get up and now come on!

133
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,027
I hope you die.

134
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:54,343
And after you die, I'll go to your grave
and eat birthday cake all by myself.

135
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,396
Mama, I think I broke something.

136
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,305
Get over here!
Come on, let's go! Come on!

137
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,644
Miss Bathsheeba!

138
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,713
My daddy fell down.

139
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,655
Oh, God. Come on, baby.

140
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,255
Be okay.

141
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,935
Hushpuppy, take this medicine.
You run fast as you can. Go.

142
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,807
<i>Daddy could've turned into a tree.</i>

143
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,673
<i>Or a bug.</i>

144
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,913
<i>There wasn't any way to know.</i>

145
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,531
<i>The whole universe...</i>

146
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,299
<i>...depends on everything
fitting together just right.</i>

147
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,140
<i>If one piece busts,
even the smallest piece...</i>

148
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,412
<i>...the entire universe will get busted.</i>

149
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,679
The storm's coming! The storm's coming!

150
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,083
The storm is coming!

151
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,781
The storm is coming!

152
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,788
Hey, Walter. What it is?
Afraid of a little water?

153
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,894
I ain't messing with you, Wink.
I'm getting out of here.

154
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,223
You can stay if you want, but I'm out.

155
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, now. What's up?

156
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,658
Look at these assholes...

157
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,395
...running around all over the damn place.
<i>C'est la vie,</i> assholes.

158
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,267
- Hey.
- Ho! There's my boy, Wink!

159
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,670
- We gonna do this storm?
- Let me tell you.

160
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,004
These assholes go up and down here
all day long.

161
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,410
That's what I'm talking about. LITTLE
We ain't leaving. I'm behind you.

162
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,744
- Man, I don't mind telling you, I am scared.
- Just leave.

163
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,682
- This ain't no little one.
- Damn pussy.

164
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,822
I'm leaving here
soon as I finish my beer.

165
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,551
No, you're not. You're gonna stay here
with me. I'll see you tomorrow, Walrus.

166
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,161
- Y'all want to die, okay, fine.
- Look at Winston.

167
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,661
Winston, I know you with me, huh, man?

168
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,460
What you gonna do about the storm,
man?

169
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,832
- Hey, Hushpuppy.
- Hushpuppy?

170
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,439
Get that girl a beer.

171
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,371
Where you been?

172
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,605
- What happened to you?
- Shut up.

173
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,906
You don't talk.

174
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,991
Come here!

175
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,786
Come here, ugly!

176
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,772
Just because you
burnt your house down...

177
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,467
...don't mean you can walk
in here and take over.

178
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,613
This side of the house
is still Wink's side.

179
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,682
No toys, no girl stuff over here.

180
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,649
And if I want to come over there
and smack you in the face...

181
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,880
...that's against the rules,
so that's a plus for you.

182
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,252
So come on down here
and get in the boat.

183
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,553
Come on, get in the boat!

184
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,891
Get in the boat.

185
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:56,372
And if the water gets real high,
we're gonna float to this roof...

186
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,271
...we're gonna bust through the ceiling
and we're gonna ride away, okay?

187
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:08,043
Now I want you to put these on, okay?
Slide your arm through here.

188
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,710
Don't you never, never take these off.

189
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,256
I'm your daddy and you're
gonna do what I tell you to do...

190
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,519
...because it's my job
to keep you from dying, okay?

191
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,061
So sit back and listen to me.

192
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,096
And close your eyes.

193
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,201
Go to sleep.

194
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,463
Go to sleep!

195
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,197
Why you staring at me like that?

196
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,031
How I'm supposed to sleep
with you staring at me like that?

197
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,073
What, you scared?

198
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,509
I'm gonna show you,
no storm can't beat no Doucet.

199
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,708
We Doucets.
We not scared of no damn storm!

200
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,821
I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna take care of that storm.

201
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,015
I'm coming to get you, storm!

202
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,196
Look at me! Look at me, Hushpuppy!

203
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,273
Look at me whip butt!
Come on, storm!

204
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,568
Come on!

205
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,609
I'm gonna get you!

206
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,680
Come on, I'm right here!

207
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,182
I'm right here! Yeah!

208
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,618
Yeah! Yeah!

209
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,390
Mama!

210
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,505
Mama?

211
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,983
<i>For the animals that didn't have a dad
to put them in a boat...</i>

212
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,288
<i>...the end of the world already happened.</i>

213
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,203
Winston!

214
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,336
Yo, Winston!

215
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,654
<i>They're all down below,
trying to breathe through water.</i>

216
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,021
Yo, Edison, you in here?

217
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,309
Someday, when I'm gone,
you gonna be the last man in the Bathtub.

218
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,848
You're gonna have to learn
how to feed yourself.

219
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,816
Now stick your hand in this water.

220
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,751
Stick it in there.

221
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,253
Okay, what you do is
you hold your hand steady...

222
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,559
...and you just wait on your fish to come.

223
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,042
You gotta ball your fist up, okay?
That's your punching hand.

224
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,976
Ball your fist up, case you have
to whack him when he come out.

225
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,052
All right, all right.

226
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,921
Oh, got it, got it!

227
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,728
Yeah! Oh, Lord!

228
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,098
Look what we got!
Look what we got!

229
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,797
Gotcha. We got it! Say, "I gotcha!"

230
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,635
- I gotcha!
- Yeah!

231
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,908
Hold him down.
You hold him down like this...

232
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,104
...and you whack him good
with your fist.

233
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,978
Go ahead, whack him!
You whack him good.

234
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,676
Hold him like that and whack him.
Hold it.

235
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,051
Ow!

236
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,616
Don't worry about that.
That's all a part of it.

237
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,887
Come on, you want to try it again?

238
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,158
Come on, one more time.

239
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,411
Mama?

240
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,621
Is that you?

241
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,266
I've broken everything.

242
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:40,225
<i>Strong animals know
when your heart is weak.</i>

243
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:46,129
<i>That makes them hungry,
and they start coming.</i>

244
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,786
Yo, Walrus.

245
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,590
Hey, man.

246
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,365
Come on, I gotcha. All right, partner.
I knew you wasn't gonna leave.

247
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,579
I must've passed out.

248
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,649
Little Jo..

249
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,583
- Hey.
- You okay, huh?

250
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,849
What happened to you? Get up.
Come on.

251
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:48,297
He been talking all night long
how it's the last night on earth.

252
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,730
Don't worry about him.
Trying to touch my titties and shit...

253
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,165
...right in front of Peter T over there.

254
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,430
- Oh, Peter T, my man.
- Hello.

255
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,234
Good to see you, man!
I knew you wasn't gonna leave me.

256
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,970
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- That's one classic dude right there.

257
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,772
You a titan, man.

258
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,313
Yeah! Glad you stayed, man.

259
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,046
If I had a pair of wings,
I know I could have flown in that bad boy.

260
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,954
Almost blew off
Walrus' panties, ha, ha, ha!

261
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,322
But I would probably
have bounced off a tree.

262
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,629
Hushpuppy.

263
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,608
Did I ever tell you the story
about your conception?

264
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,039
Jesus.

265
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:43,045
One day, when me and Hushpuppy
mama first met...

266
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,654
...we were so shy,
we used to sit around...

267
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,021
...and drink beer
and smile at each other.

268
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,490
One day, I got so shy, I just napped.

269
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,260
<i>Back when Daddy
used to talk about Mama...</i>

270
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:40,769
<i>...he said she was so pretty,
she never even had to turn on the stove.</i>

271
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,310
<i>She'd just walk into the room...</i>

272
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,075
<i>...and all the water starts to boil.</i>

273
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:10,399
Your mama battered that gator up
and set it to frying.

274
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:18,944
And Hushpuppy popped into the universe
about four minutes later.

275
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,188
I got it under control.

276
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,113
Miss Bathsheeba!

277
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,019
Come on, y'all. Come on, girlie! Come on!

278
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,716
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

279
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,656
- That's it.
- Thank you.

280
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,728
- Thank you. Very nice.
- Look what we got.

281
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,525
We got the fresh catch today.
You like that, babe?

282
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,326
Yeah! Come on!

283
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,561
Come on, children,
I got some for y'all too.

284
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,172
Yeah! Let's go. Time to eat.

285
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:34,249
For the ones we never find,
we make a funeral the Bathtub way.

286
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,318
Yeah, tastes like more.
Come on. All right.

287
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,477
<i>With no crying allowed.</i>

288
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,917
Yes, to the water!

289
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,651
Come on, boy! Come on!

290
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,228
Pick that goddamn thing up!
Let's go!

291
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,490
Okay.

292
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,765
So I say to myself...

293
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,599
...I'm gonna pee in my pants just a little.
Hell, when the water goes down...

294
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,003
...I'm gonna French kiss the dirt.

295
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,235
The water ain't going down, man.

296
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,142
That's my beautiful place
under that water.

297
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,942
Everything beautiful is gone.

298
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,314
Man, you know they got salt in that water,
done ate everything up.

299
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,149
Trees are gonna die first,
then the animals, then the fish.

300
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,522
You gotta think about moving.

301
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,630
I got it under control.

302
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,433
Come here, Hushpuppy.
Come sit by your Uncle Jean.

303
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,300
Let me show you how to do this.
Here. Here, baby.

304
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,269
Don't be scared of it, now.
Now, turn it upside-down.

305
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,708
There you go.
Now, push it with your thumb.

306
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,210
Good girl. That's it.

307
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:45,445
And then, real careful,
take this knife and you pop this off.

308
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,821
That's beautiful.

309
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,155
No, HUSHPUPPY!

310
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,161
Beast it.

311
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,767
Beast it!

312
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,463
Show me you can do it!

313
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,506
- Come on, I know you can do it.
- Come on!

314
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,769
- Beast it!
- Come on, now!

315
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,573
Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!

316
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,148
<i>Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!</i>

317
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,375
Beast it. Beast it.

318
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,756
Come on, now! Beast it!

319
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,685
Yeah!

320
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,195
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

321
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,765
You see what kind of family we got?
We got feeling!

322
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,607
You're an animal!

323
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,946
Yeah, you're an animal. Yeah.

324
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,021
Yeah!

325
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,495
<i>It wasn't no time to sit around
crying like a bunch of pussies.</i>

326
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,010
<i>We're gonna make a camp
right on top of the Bathtub.</i>

327
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,751
<i>We got enough animals to eat
until the water goes down.</i>

328
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,136
Like this.

329
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,303
Smoother. Gentler.

330
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,703
Yeah, that's right. Right there.

331
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,572
It's gonna be all right.

332
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,804
Okay. Okay.

333
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,815
That's the most important thing
I can ever teach y'all.

334
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,653
Y'all got to learn how to take care
of people smaller and sweeter than you are.

335
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,327
You got it.

336
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,859
You okay?

337
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,384
<i>Two weeks later,
everything started to die.</i>

338
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,242
Got to get something out of this water.

339
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:51,321
Walrus, you want to leave the Bathtub?

340
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,859
No.

341
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,258
I heard that.

342
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,699
Nobody is leaving the Bathtub.

343
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,535
You don't know nothing.

344
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:15,713
This water gonna kill us here.
We gotta do something about this.

345
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:21,422
I ain't starving to death while them people
going grocery shopping and all that.

346
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,711
Shit. Son of a...

347
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,892
Boss, Daddy got to go
take care of something.

348
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,432
I'm gonna fix everything the way it was.

349
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,663
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry. I'm the man.

350
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,671
We gonna win.

351
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,334
And if anything go wrong,
Walrus is daddy.

352
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,185
You gonna be the king of the Bathtub.
I promise that.

353
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,721
Just sit right there. I'll be back.

354
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,546
I think they be gone.
I really can't say where.

355
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,808
What are you
talking about? They go to the levee?

356
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,282
- Ain't no problem.
- Don't make me slap your ass!

357
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:01,014
You so much as piss on that wall,
you know what them people gonna do?

358
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,556
They gonna find us
and stick us in a damn shelter.

359
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,896
<i>Daddy says brave men don't run
from their home.</i>

360
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,627
Peter T, hold onto the boat.
You're gonna be fine.

361
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:38,086
Peter T, you hold the trip wire. Okay?

362
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,163
- Get the line over there.
- Okay.

363
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,552
<i>The entire universe depends on
everything fitting together just right.</i>

364
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,555
<i>If you can fix the broken piece,
everything can go right back.</i>

365
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,129
Come on, baby!

366
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,873
Peter T...

367
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,147
...hand me that trip wire.

368
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,753
I'm so sorry, but...

369
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,220
Peter T, you drop the trip wire?

370
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,017
Well, yes, I did.

371
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,685
- Peter T.
- I gotta go find it.

372
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,472
Get over here!

373
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,202
Aah! What are you doing, woman?

374
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,314
I'm hauling your ass home, little boy.

375
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,847
Get off!

376
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,985
Touch that wall,
they gonna come after us.

377
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,517
You don't know nothing!

378
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,450
Jean Battiste! Get the trip line!

379
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,351
Get in the boat!
Get your ass in here!

380
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,385
HUSHPUPPY!

381
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,262
Pull!

382
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,538
- Pull, pull!
- Now, boss!

383
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,977
- Now, boss!
- No!

384
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,758
<i>It didn't matter
that the water was gone.</i>

385
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,726
<i>Sometimes you can
break something so bad...</i>

386
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,797
<i>...that it can't get put back together.</i>

387
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,019
Mama!

388
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,366
Mama!

389
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,238
This is a mandatory evacuation area.
You can no longer live here.

390
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:28,612
I repeat,
this is a mandatory evacuation area.

391
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,566
<i>When you're small,
you gotta fix what you can.</i>

392
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,203
Goddamn!

393
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,829
What the hell wrong with you?
What you doing?

394
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,004
- What you gonna do now, huh?
- Grr!

395
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:41,012
Oh, you want to throw things, huh?
All right, I can do that too.

396
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,453
Come on, then.
You want to play the game?

397
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,219
Come on, let's throw stuff. Come on!

398
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,863
I can do that too! So come on.

399
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,659
You want to throw stuff? Come on!

400
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,130
Come on. Aah!

401
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,194
Come on!

402
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,804
Ah! Ah! Ah!

403
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,305
Aagh!

404
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,575
Gotcha. Come on, come on!

405
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,211
Aagh! Gotcha. Come on! Come on!

406
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,874
Come on.

407
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,689
Uh...

408
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,642
Man, you think I don't know.

409
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,148
You think I can't see?

410
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,048
No crying.

411
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,091
No crying, man! Hey!

412
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:59,233
Goddamn it, I said no crying!

413
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,923
Come on, get a drink.

414
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:57,315
This counts as I'm sorry
for a whole bunch of things, Lord.

415
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,872
You gonna be dead?

416
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,372
No.

417
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,972
You gonna leave me alone?

418
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,677
No, I ain't gonna leave you alone.

419
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,716
Because if you be gone, I be gone too.

420
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,319
No, that's not how it work.

421
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,685
Sometimes in the bed...

422
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:34,192
...I start to shake and I can't stop.
I got what you got.

423
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,230
No, that's just a side effect
of you being a stupid little girl.

424
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,998
I ain't gonna be dead?

425
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,161
No, you'll probably live
a hundred years more.

426
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,769
Come on, let me see them guns.
Come on. Show me them guns.

427
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,676
Let me see them.
Come on, show them to me.

428
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,245
Show them to me.
Show me them guns!

429
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,977
Show them to me! Guns!

430
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,816
Guns! Guns! Guns!

431
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,982
Gun! Guns! Come on. Come on.

432
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,151
Come on!

433
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,159
Come on! Let me have it!

434
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,831
You the man! Who the man?

435
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,768
- I'm the man.
- Yeah, you the man!

436
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,839
- Who the man?
- I'm the man!

437
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,977
- You the man! Who the man?
- I'm the man.

438
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,545
- I'm the man! I'm the man!
- Yeah, you the man! Fuck this table. Shit!

439
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,057
I got to go lay down.

440
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,154
I got to get strong.

441
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,128
Don't be scared.

442
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,338
What?

443
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,644
Come on.

444
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,461
Lay down.

445
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,831
- Hey.
- Yeah?

446
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,925
You ain't the one that's sick.

447
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,244
<i>Strong animals got no mercy.</i>

448
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,578
<i>They're the type of animals...</i>

449
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,656
<i>...that eat their own mamas and daddies.</i>

450
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,809
Think someone is in there? I don't know.
This is a freaking shack.

451
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,845
Go check around the back.

452
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,216
There's no one in there.
Look at this place.

453
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,516
- Will you please open the door?
- Get back.

454
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,217
This is a mandatory evacuation area.

455
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,396
Everyone in this region has to leave.

456
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,691
We ain't going nowhere!

457
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,794
Sir, we have food and shelter.

458
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,629
- Kick it in.
- Go around the back.

459
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,203
Let's go. Get in there.

460
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,771
Just remain calm.

461
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,238
Son, you want me to cancel
your birth certificate?

462
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,934
- Grab her arm!
- Son of a bitch!

463
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,206
- Get your hands off of me!
- Hold her down. Hold her down!

464
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,941
- Stay down, sir.
- Stay down!

465
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:53,246
- Let her go! I'm gonna kill you!
- You have her?

466
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,752
Let her go!

467
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,288
- Keep still.
- Let her go!

468
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,680
<i>It didn't look like a prison.</i>

469
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:23,215
<i>It looked more like a fish tank
with no water.</i>

470
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,555
<i>They said that we were here
for our own good.</i>

471
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,197
You're supposed to hear me!
I want an answer!

472
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:42,495
I don't have an answer.
The doctor is gonna have to give you that.

473
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:47,766
Don't eat that, hear?

474
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,974
Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you?

475
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,275
We found something in your test.

476
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,975
- It's urgent...
- Whoa, whoa. Not in front of my kid.

477
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,018
Stay there, Hushpuppy.

478
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,679
- The procedure is...
- I said not in front of my kid.

479
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,518
The procedure is very risky.

480
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,320
There's really no way to guarantee
it will be successful.

481
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,190
In case anything happens...

482
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,165
- Get your hands off me.
- If we don't do this, you could die.

483
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,841
- I tell you! I don't need nothing from you!
- Hey, stop it!

484
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,141
- Mr. Doucet, calm down!
- Stop it! Come here.

485
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,842
I tell you! I tell you!
You don't tell me!

486
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:35,114
- Calm down!
- Let me go! Get your hands off me!

487
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,383
I don't need nothing from y'all.
Let me go!

488
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:38,958
Wink!

489
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,595
- Leave her alone!
- Let go of me!

490
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:42,855
Stop it!

491
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,563
Get off of me!

492
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,223
Daddy!

493
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:53,398
You're gonna have time-out.
Are you even listening to me?

494
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,485
<i>When an animal gets sick here...</i>

495
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,986
<i>...they plug it into the wall.</i>

496
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,612
They're coming for you.

497
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,510
<i>Daddy used to say that
if he ever got so old...</i>

498
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,620
<i>...he couldn't drink beer
and catch catfish...</i>

499
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,485
<i>...then I had to put him in the boat
and set him on fire...</i>

500
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,786
<i>...so no one could come plug him
into the wall.</i>

501
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,585
Dave.

502
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,994
Dave, help me out. Help me out.

503
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,236
Boss.

504
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,309
Get up. We busting out of here.

505
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,911
Come on.

506
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,788
Wait, there's a person out there.

507
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,284
Here you go.

508
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,030
Hey! Go home!

509
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,197
Come on, let's go! Everybody get out!

510
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,975
Wait, wait, wait.

511
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,378
Let's go! Let's go!

512
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:45,299
- Make sure you put her somewhere good.
- Let me out of here! No! No!

513
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,031
Let me go!

514
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,140
- Let me off!
- Get off me!

515
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,818
You're trying to get rid of me!
You're trying to get rid of me!

516
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,684
Listen to me.
I'm not trying to get rid of you.

517
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,485
- Yes, you is.
- You don't understand!

518
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,721
I can't take care of you no more,
you understand?

519
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,558
I'm dying!

520
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,169
My blood is eating itself.

521
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,635
You know what that mean?

522
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:24,868
Don't be saying things about dying.

523
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:29,706
- Everybody daddies die.
- Not my daddy.

524
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,749
Yeah, your daddy.

525
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,392
I didn't want you to watch that, okay?

526
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,454
You understand?

527
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,700
Come on, let's go!

528
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,278
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here! Come on!

529
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,415
Come on, let's go!

530
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,579
Wait, wait, wait.

531
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,415
- Back up, back up.
- Girls, get back.

532
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:12,923
- Dad! Come on! Come on!
- Give him room to breathe.

533
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,094
Walrus, get me home.

534
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,216
<i>Everybody loses the thing
that made them.</i>

535
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:15,080
<i>It's even how
it's supposed to be in nature.</i>

536
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,687
<i>The brave men stay and watch it happen.</i>

537
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,789
<i>They don't run.</i>

538
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,011
Come on!

539
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,324
I'm going by my mom.

540
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,524
That's a good place to go.

541
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,922
Which way are we going?

542
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,117
It don't matter, baby.

543
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,388
This boat will take you
exactly where you need to be.

544
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,726
It's that kind of boat.

545
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,834
Want a chicken biscuit?

546
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,465
They're good for you.

547
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,704
I've been eating these all my life.

548
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:59,677
I keep the wrappers in the boat
because they remind me of who I was...

549
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,719
...when I ate each one.

550
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,950
The smell makes me feel cohesive.

551
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,088
I want to be cohesive.

552
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:12,630
I'm sure you will, baby.
No doubt in my mind.

553
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,787
Oh, hi.

554
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:15,121
Sergeant Major, how are you doing?

555
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,195
Hey, Miss Frankie.

556
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,688
Holy crap. You have toddlers.

557
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:23,496
- A whole litter of them.
- Oh, they are so cute.

558
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,679
They're so cute.

559
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,373
Hey, baby.

560
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,140
<i>I'd work for you
I'd even slave for you</i>

561
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,210
<i>I'd be a beggar or a knave for you</i>

562
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:17,949
<i>And if that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

563
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:23,054
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

564
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,616
You need something, baby?

565
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:56,152
Well, what you want? You alone?

566
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,199
That's it?

567
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,999
Get in here.
Let me show you a magic trick.

568
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,227
Let me tell you something.

569
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,561
When you're a child,
people say that life...

570
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,500
...is gonna be happy
and hunky-dory and all that bullshit...

571
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:43,131
...but I'm here to tell you that it's not, so
you need to get that out your head right now.

572
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,336
Because, yeah, life is some big old feast,
but you...

573
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,275
...ain't nothing
but a stupid little waitress.

574
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:54,049
One day, everything on your plate
gonna fall on the floor.

575
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,151
And nobody gonna be there
to pick it up for you.

576
01:16:57,312 --> 01:17:01,055
One day, it's gonna be all on you.

577
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,790
You understand what I'm saying?

578
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:11,666
So smile, girl.

579
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:15,535
Smile.

580
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:20,570
Because nobody like
a pity-party-having-ass woman.

581
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,452
The gator is magic.

582
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,858
Oh. Mm-hm.

583
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,012
You can take care of me.

584
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,277
Me and Daddy.

585
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,490
Don't know nothing about your daddy.

586
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:06,819
I can't take care of nobody but myself.

587
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,459
<i>And if that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

588
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,394
You can stay if you want.

589
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,228
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

590
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,965
<i>I'd gladly move</i>

591
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,668
This is my favorite thing.

592
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:24,466
<i>To prove my love, dear, and its worth</i>

593
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,078
I know.

594
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,677
<i>If that isn't love,
It'll have to do</i>

595
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,819
<i>I can count all the times I've been lifted.</i>

596
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:39,490
<i>I can count all the times I've been lifted
on two fingers.</i>

597
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,096
Wink! Bring my baby here!

598
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:46,391
We got to wash her up!

599
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,398
No, that waits.

600
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,233
All right, fatso, breathe some air.

601
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,579
I need to go home.

602
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,981
<i>If that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

603
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,684
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

604
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,734
You're my friend, kind of.

605
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,282
I gotta take care of mine.

606
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,691
Real good.

607
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,241
No crying, hear?

608
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,949
No crying.

609
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,468
Don't you cry.

610
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:14,843
As I stand by the bayou,
I watch a ship as she disappears.

611
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,448
There, she is gone.

612
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,084
And we cry for this.

613
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,947
But she's not gone.

614
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,818
She's just as real as when she left me.

615
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:28,188
And somewhere else,
other voices are calling out:

616
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,953
"Here she comes."

617
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:32,291
And that is dying.

618
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:35,366
Here she comes!

619
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:49,212
<i>When it all goes quiet
behind my eyes...</i>

620
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,441
<i>...I see everything that made me...</i>

621
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:54,553
<i>...flying around in invisible pieces.</i>

622
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,524
<i>When I look too hard, it goes away.</i>

623
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:07,261
<i>But when it all goes quiet,
I see they are right here.</i>

624
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:13,169
<i>I see that I'm a little piece
of a big, big universe.</i>

625
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,401
<i>And that makes things right.</i>

626
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:24,681
<i>When I die, the scientists of the future...</i>

627
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:27,376
<i>...they're going to find it all.</i>

628
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,215
<i>They're going to know...</i>

629
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,682
<i>...once, there was a Hushpuppy...</i>

630
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:34,656
<i>...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.</i>
