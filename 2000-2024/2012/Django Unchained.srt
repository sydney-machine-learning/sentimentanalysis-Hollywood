2
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,595
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?

3
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,806
State your business,
or prepare to get winged!

4
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:30,605
Calm yourselves gentlemen,
I mean you no harm.

5
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,173
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

6
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,327
Good cold evening gentlemen,

7
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,977
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

8
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,736
that go by the name of
the Speck Brothers.

9
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,610
Might that be you?

10
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,166
Who wants to know?

11
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,716
Well, I do.

12
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,634
I'm Dr. King Schultz,
this is my horse, Fritz.

13
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,251
What kinda doctor?

14
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,698
Dentist.

15
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,487
Now are you the Speck Brothers,

16
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,299
and did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

17
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,233
So what?

18
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,325
So, I wish to parley with you.

19
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,426
Speak English.

20
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,031
Please forgive me,
it is a second language.

22
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,653
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

23
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,706
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

24
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,180
Hello you poor devils!

25
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:25,511
Is there one amongst you, who was formerly
a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?

26
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,815
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.

27
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,322
Who said that?

28
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,998
What's your name?

29
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,511
Django.

30
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,704
Then you're exactly
the one I'm looking for.

31
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?

32
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,184
Who are they?

33
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,736
Big John…

34
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,025
Ellis…

35
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,630
and Roger…
sometime they call him Lit'le Raj.

36
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,269
They was overseers at Carrucan plantation.

37
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,597
Not anymore.

38
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:57,977
Tell me…

39
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:02,392
If you were to see any of these three
gentlemen again, would you recognize them?

40
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,591
Hey!

41
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,590
Stop talk with 'em like that.

42
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:06,935
Like what?

43
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,169
Like that!

44
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,113
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain-

45
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,777
Speak English, goddammit!

46
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,182
Everybody calm down,

47
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:19,204
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

48
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,076
I don't care.
No sale.

49
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,139
Now off wit' you!

50
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,561
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
o'course they're for sale.

51
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,294
Move it.

52
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:32,782
My good man, did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture,

53
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:36,728
or are you pointing your weapon
at me with lethal intention?

54
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,930
Last chance, fancy pants.

55
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,825
Oh, very well…

56
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,514
I'm sorry to have put
a bullet in your beast,

57
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,655
but I didn't want you to do anything rash

58
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,229
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

59
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,319
Goddamn son of a bitch!

60
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,616
You shot Roscoe!

61
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,011
And you killed Ace!

62
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:30,274
Hey, I only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me.

63
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,336
And I do believe I have

64
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:36,610
one, two, three, four, five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

65
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,462
Damn leg's busted!

66
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,326
No doubt. Now, if you can keep
your caterwauling down to a minimum,

67
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,406
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

68
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,651
God fucking dammit!

69
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,260
As I was saying,

70
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:57,127
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers
again, you could recognize them?

71
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,925
Yeah.

72
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:01,940
Sold American!
So Mr. Speck,

73
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,948
Mr. Speck, how much
for young Django here?

74
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,668
That iron is nasty business.

75
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,622
Could you hold this for a moment?

76
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,411
Thank you.
Django, get up on that horse.

77
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:32,251
Also if I were you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

78
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,731
Nigger, don't you touch my brother's coat!

79
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,366
Goddammit!

80
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:10,490
One hundred… ten…

81
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,835
twenty… and five…

82
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,085
for young Django here.

83
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:21,997
And since you won't be needing it anymore,
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

84
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:27,446
Also… Mr. Speck, I am afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

85
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,941
Do you have one?

86
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,792
You go to hell, dentist!

87
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,194
I thought not.

88
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,425
No worries!

89
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,074
I come prepared.

90
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,248
Thank you.

91
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,406
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.

92
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,420
Now as to you poor devils…

93
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:14,184
So as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

94
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,329
you gentlemen have two choices.

95
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:22,629
One: once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

96
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,530
then carry him to the nearest town.

97
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:28,277
Which would be at least thirty-seven
miles back the way you came.

98
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,243
Or Two:

99
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,601
You could unshackle yourselves…

100
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:37,152
take that rifle, put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

101
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,567
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.

102
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,825
The choice is yours.

103
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,679
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

104
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,366
the North Star is that one.

105
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,041
Tata.

106
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,811
Now wait a minute fellas,
let's talk about this.

107
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,997
You gotta be reasonable
on a situation like this.

108
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,774
I'm not a bad guy,
look I'm just doing my job!

109
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:29,231
Blueberry, didn't I give you
my last apple?

110
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:34,654
Tell you what boys, take me to the doc
in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.

111
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,621
No. No, please-

112
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,061
What's everybody staring at?

113
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,179
They never seen a nigger
on a horse before.

114
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,888
Good morning inn keeper!

115
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,700
Two beers for two weary travelers.

116
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,995
Ah, it's still a bit early.

117
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,229
We won't be open for another hour.

118
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,633
By then we'll be servin' breakfast.

119
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,407
Whoa whoa whoa!

120
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,723
What the hell you think you doin', boy?

121
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,281
Get that nigger outta here.

122
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,972
Help! Help!

123
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,241
Inn keeper!

124
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,853
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshall.

125
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,106
Alas…

126
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:06,397
Now we must act as our own bartender.

127
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,710
Sit down, my boy.

128
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,332
What kinda dentist are you?

129
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,126
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

130
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,747
These days I practice a new profession.

131
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,441
Bounty Hunter.

132
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,418
D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?

133
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,719
No.

134
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,930
Well…

135
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:56,675
The way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

136
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,038
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

137
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,788
Prost.

138
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,961
The state places a bounty on a man's head,

139
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,102
I track that man, I find
that man, I kill that man,

140
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:25,442
after I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities,

141
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,860
and sometimes that's
easier said then done,

142
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,569
I show that corpse to the authorities
proving, yes indeed, I truly have killed him,

143
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:35,391
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

144
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,695
So… like slavery, it's a
flesh-for-cash business.

145
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,482
What's a bounty?

146
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,538
It's like a reward.

147
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:50,828
You kill people and
they give you a reward?

148
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,919
Certain people, yeah.

149
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,019
Bad people?

150
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,272
Aah!

151
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,331
Badder they are, bigger the reward!

152
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,968
Which brings me to you.

153
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:04,030
And I must admit that I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

154
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:07,442
On one hand, I despise slavery.

155
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,520
On the other hand…

156
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,844
I need your help, if you're not
in a position to refuse, all the better.

157
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,607
So for the time being, I'm gonna make
this slave malarkey work to my benefit.

158
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,472
Still… having said that…

159
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,868
I feel guilty.

160
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,252
So…

161
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:32,393
I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

162
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,846
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

163
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,621
However, at this endeavor,
I'm- I'm at a slight disadvantage,

164
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,049
in so far as, I don't
know what they look like.

165
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,232
But you do… don't you?

166
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,866
I know what they look like, all right.

167
00:17:59,008 --> 00:17:59,693
Good.

168
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:02,405
So here's my agreement.

169
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,874
You travel with me until we find them-

170
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:05,952
Where we goin'?

171
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:10,210
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.

172
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:15,921
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find them.

173
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,591
And when we find them…

174
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,833
you point them out, and I kill them!

175
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,713
You do that, I agree to
give you your freedom,

176
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:30,080
twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother
that's seventyfive dollars,

177
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:34,281
and as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

178
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,819
Okay boys, fun's over.

179
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,699
Come on out.

180
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,258
All right folks, calm down.

181
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,883
You bout your business.

182
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,054
The jokers will be gone soon.

183
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,034
Now…

184
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:07,302
why y'all wanna come into
my town and start trouble,

185
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,724
and… scare all these nice people?

186
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,847
You ain't got nothin' better to do,

187
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:21,232
than to come into Bill Sharp's
town and show your ass?

188
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,297
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?

189
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,382
Now you can get the marshall.

190
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,265
<i>Marshall, marshall!</i>

191
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:51,640
Should we wait inside?

192
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,019
Can't we just leave?

193
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,349
After you.

194
00:19:56,426 --> 00:20:00,658
Move that buckboard long ways
'cross the street from the saloon!

195
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,206
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

196
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,334
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof,

197
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,394
two men two rifles on that roof.

198
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,055
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

199
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,998
Somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

200
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,452
You in the saloon!

201
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,351
We got a hundred riffles aimed
on every way outta that buildin'!

202
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,137
You got once chance git outta this alive!

203
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,163
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

204
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:30,347
and I mean, right now!

205
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,734
Is this the marshall I have
the pleasure of addressing?

206
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,336
Yes it is.

207
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,856
This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.

208
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,192
That wunderbar, marshall.

209
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,299
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

210
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,448
and just as you have instructed,

211
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,399
I am ready to step outside,

212
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,407
with my hands raised above my head.

213
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,677
I trust,

214
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:03,818
as a representative of the criminal justice
system of The United States of America,

215
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,641
I shan't be shot down in the street,

216
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,833
by either you or your deputies,

217
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:12,474
before I've had my day in court.

218
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,776
You mean like you did our sheriff?

219
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,278
Shot 'em down like a dog in the street!

220
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,675
Yes, that's exactly what I mean!

221
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,847
Do I have your word as a lawman,

222
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,058
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?

223
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,190
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy
seein' somethin' like that,

224
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,083
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

225
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,753
Fair enough marshall, here we come!

226
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,333
They're a little tense out there.

227
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:47,292
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

228
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:49,946
Come ahead.

229
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,218
You unarmed?

230
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,593
Yes indeed we are.

231
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,159
Marshall Tatum, may I address
you and your deputies,

232
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,618
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

233
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,142
as to the incident that just occurred?

234
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,277
Go on.

235
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:12,277
Thank you.

236
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,167
My name is Dr. King Schultz,

237
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,274
and like yourself, marshall,
I am a servant of the court.

238
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,418
The man lying dead in the dirt,

239
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,225
who the good people of Daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,

240
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,341
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

241
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:30,831
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

242
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,588
with a price on his
head of two hundred dollars.

243
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,533
Now, that's two hundred dollars,
dead or alive.

244
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,553
The hell you say!

245
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,308
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

246
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,841
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

247
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,333
sometime in the last two years.

248
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,737
I know this because three years ago,

249
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:57,688
he was rustling cattle from the B.C.
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

250
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,695
Now this is a warrant,

251
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:07,023
made out by circuit court Judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.

252
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,253
You're encouraged to wire him.

253
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,331
He'll back up who I am,

254
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,359
and who your dear departed sheriff was.

255
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,175
In other words marshall,

256
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,245
you owe me two hundred dollars.

257
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,691
I'll be damned.

258
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,740
After this Brittle business
is behind us…

259
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:10,468
you'll be a free man.

260
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:14,858
With a horse, seventy five
dollars in your back pocket.

261
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,719
What's your plan after that?

262
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,148
Find my wife…

263
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,492
and buy her freedom.

264
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:27,928
Django…

265
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:31,245
I had no idea you were a married man.

266
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,353
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

267
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,313
Me and my wife do.

268
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,228
Old man Carrucan didn't,
that's why we uh…

269
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,467
we run off.

270
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,170
Django…

271
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,065
Django, Django…

272
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,683
You got sand, Django.

273
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,609
Boy's got sand.

274
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,842
I got no use for niggers with sand.

275
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,605
I want you to burn the runaway “r”
right here on his cheek.

276
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:06,494
And the girl too.

277
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,355
And I want you to take 'em
to the Greenville auction,

278
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,199
and sell 'em…

279
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,264
Both of 'em…

280
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Separately.

281
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,227
And this one…

282
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,577
you will sell him cheap.

283
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,442
In Greenville…

284
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,927
There should be some
sort of a records office.

285
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,914
You know when she was sold…

286
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,830
you know where she came from…

287
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,855
and you know her name.

288
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:53,128
What is her name?

289
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:54,835
Broomhilda.

290
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,442
What?

291
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,344
Broom-hilda.

292
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:01,633
– Broomhilda?
– Hm-hm.

293
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,576
Were her owners German?

294
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,186
Yeah, how you know?

295
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,165
She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation,
she was raised by a German mistress.

296
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,360
Von Shafts.

297
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,907
She speak a little German too.

298
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,044
– Your wife?
– Hm-hm.

299
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:20,013
When she was little, her mistress taught
her so she has somebody speak German with.

300
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,516
Alright, let me get this straight.

301
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:28,964
Your slave wife speaks German,
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

302
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,906
Yep.

303
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:36,019
They call me Hildi.

304
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,550
When we gain access to these plantations,

305
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:59,456
we'll be putting on an “Act”.

306
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,307
You'll  be playing a character.

307
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,522
Hm?

308
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,389
No?

309
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,544
But during the act,
you can never break character.

310
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,729
D'you understand?

311
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,837
Yeah. Don't break character.

312
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,895
And you character is
that of the “Valet”.

313
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,194
What that is?

314
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,521
That's a fancy word for servant.

315
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,498
– “Valet”.
– Hm-hm!

316
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:49,970
And now Django, you may chose
your character's costume.

317
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,297
You's gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

318
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,531
You but of course!

319
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:33,460
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

320
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,896
This is my valet,
my valet does not walk.

321
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,623
I said niggers on horses-

322
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:44,046
His name is Django, he's a free man,
he can ride what he pleases.

323
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:45,743
Not on my property.

324
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,686
Not around my niggers he can't.

325
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,963
My good sir…

326
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,998
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

327
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,769
Allow me to unring this bell.

328
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:59,691
My name is Dr. King Schultz,
this is my valet Django,

329
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:02,490
and these are our horses
Tony and Fritz.

330
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,036
Mr. Bennett,

331
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:12,187
I've been lead to believe that you are
a gentleman, and a business man.

332
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:15,473
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas

333
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,656
to Tennessee to parley with you now.

334
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,737
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

335
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:29,586
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?

336
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,693
No appointment, no nuttin'?

337
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,506
Oh, I'm afraid so.

338
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:38,096
Well what if I had to say I don't
like you, or your fancy pants nigger,

339
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,179
and I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

340
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,648
Now what'cha gotta say about that?

341
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,184
Mr. Bennett,

342
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:51,489
if you are the business man
I've been led to believe you to be,

343
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,289
I have five thousand things that I might
say that could change your mind.

344
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,285
Well com'on inside, and get yourself
somethin' cool to drink.

345
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,913
Huh. Hm-hm.

346
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,859
Oh maybe, while we discuss business,

347
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,296
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

348
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:26,222
to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

349
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:28,604
Oh, absolutely!
Eh, Betina!

350
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,675
Yessir, Big Daddy?

351
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,013
Eh… What's your Jimmie's name again?

352
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,849
– Django.
– Django.

353
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:36,227
Betina sugar, could
you take Django there,

354
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,846
and take him around the grounds here
to show him all the pretty stuff.

355
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,207
As you please, Big Daddy.

356
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,378
Oh, Mr. Bennett,

357
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:47,618
I must remind you Django is a free man.
He cannot be treated like a slave.

358
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:51,452
Within the bounds of good taste, he must
be treated as an extension of myself.

359
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,611
Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?

360
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:54,427
Yes, sir?

361
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:56,607
Django isn't a slave.

362
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,544
Django is a free man. You understand?

363
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:03,196
You can't treat him like any
of these other niggers around here,

364
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:06,027
cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?

365
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,036
You wan' I should
treat him like white folks?

366
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,361
No.

367
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,254
That's not what I said.

368
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,891
Then I don't know
what'cha want, Big Daddy.

369
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,704
Yes… I can see that.

370
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,106
Uh…

371
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:24,074
What's the name of that peckawood boy
from town that works with the glass?

372
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,666
His mama work over at the lumber yard.

373
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,127
Oh, you mean Jerry.

374
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,913
That's the boy's name, Jerry!

375
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,374
You know Jerry, don't you sugar?

376
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,686
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

377
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,561
Well that's it then…

378
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,362
You just treat 'em like you would Jerry.

379
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,359
The house we just left from,
is the big house.

380
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,417
Big daddy call it that, cause it's big.

381
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,816
That there is the pantry.

382
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,798
That's where Bid Daddy
hang out his dead meat.

383
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,662
Poor lil' squirrels.

384
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,771
What'cha do for your massa'?

385
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,840
Didn't you hear him tell ya
I ain't no slave?

386
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,117
So you really free?

387
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,352
Yes. I is free.

388
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,869
You mean you wanna dress like that?

389
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,074
Betina, I need to ask you something.

390
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,332
What'cho want?

391
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,112
I'm lookin' for three white men.

392
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,411
Three brothers, overseers.
Their name is Brittle. Do you know 'em?

393
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,225
Brittle?

394
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,676
Yes, Brittle.
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,

395
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,637
Roger Brittle. Sometime called Li'le Raj.

396
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,199
I don't know dem.

397
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,795
They could be usin' a different name.

398
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,300
They would have come to
the plantation this past year.

399
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,029
You mean The Shaffers?

400
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,157
Maybe. Three brothers?

401
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,345
Ahhuh.

402
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,392
– Are they here?
– Ah-huh!

403
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,331
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

404
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,836
Well one o' 'em's over in that field.

405
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,155
Old man Carrucan ain't going
to appreciate this now, she- she-

406
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:03,159
she work in a house, John,
you could mess her skin up,

407
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,557
if you gonna mess up,
she ain't gonna be worth no-

408
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,080
she ain't gonna worth a damn thing.

409
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:07,509
Now- like the bible say…

410
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,016
Look, I- I told you, I was
the one to make her do it.

411
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,069
You're ready?

412
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:19,664
She didn't wanna run off with me, if- if anybody
should be gettin' whipped now, should be me!

413
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,199
It should be me John, I been here
long enough, you know me!

414
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,814
You know me a long time, now!

415
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,411
You know master Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this!

416
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,271
She's- she's a house slave!

417
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:38,896
She won't serve anyone if she-

418
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:44,696
<i>♪Looking for freedom</i>

419
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,280
<i>♪Looking for freedom ah-aah</i>

420
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:01,938
Please, please now.

421
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,894
Ain't this what you want? To keep me
funny fighting at each other, please…

422
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:11,921
I's on my knees, John.

423
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,225
I like the way you beg, boy.

424
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,716
Is that who you was lookin' for?

425
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:22,880
Yep.

426
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,525
Where the other two at?

427
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,321
They by the stable, punishin'
Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

428
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,248
They whippin' Little Jody?

429
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,651
Point me in that direction.

430
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,176
You go to that tree,
and keep goin' that a'way.

431
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,676
Go get that white man I came here with.

432
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,331
Com'on now.
Com'on, girlie!

433
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,716
Com'on… get you set up!

434
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,283
And the Lord said the fear of ye…

435
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,358
and the dread of ye…

436
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,903
shall be on every beast of the earth.

437
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,354
Hey, gimme that arm!
You better gimme that arm,

438
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,486
you better gimme that arm!

439
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,566
Okay, she ready!

440
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:43,093
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

441
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,828
John Brittle!

442
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,529
Remember me?

443
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,013
I like the way you die, boy!

444
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,032
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch!

445
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,594
Ya'll wanna see somethin'?

446
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:23,551
Aagh! no!

447
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,283
Who are they?

448
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:39,720
That's Big John, and that's little Raj.

449
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,252
Where's Ellis?

450
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:44,617
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

451
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,418
– You sure that's him?
– Yeah.

452
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,402
– Positive?
– I dunno.

453
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:55,033
– You don't know if you're positive?
– I don't know what positive means.

454
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,073
It means you're sure.

455
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,206
– Yes.
– Yes, what?

456
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,822
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

457
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,924
I'm positive he dead.

458
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,917
Django!

459
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:24,105
Everybody calm down,

460
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,496
we mean no one else any harm.

461
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,292
Who are you two jokers?

462
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,271
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

463
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:34,675
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America,

464
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:38,338
the man to my left is Django
Freeman, he's my deputy.

465
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,030
In my pocket is a warrant

466
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:45,448
signed by circuit court judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas,

467
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:50,120
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive, of

468
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,599
John Brittle, Roger Brittle,
and Ellis Brittle.

469
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,013
They've gone by the name Shaffer.

470
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:02,214
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butcher's real name was Brittle.

471
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,989
These are wanted men.
The law wants them for murder.

472
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:10,395
Now I reiterate,
the warrant states dead or alive,

473
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:13,705
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

474
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:17,241
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

475
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,772
I realize…

476
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,768
passions are high,

477
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,963
but I must warn you,

478
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:28,336
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a office of the court

479
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,389
in the performance of his duty is,

480
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,055
you will be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

481
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:41,266
May I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

482
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:44,951
Gimmie.

483
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,421
Satisfied?

484
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,904
May I have that back, please?

485
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,825
Get off my land.

486
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,492
Post haste.

487
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,655
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can,

488
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,533
and let's get out of here.

489
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:51,798
Yeah…

490
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,390
That's them sonsabitches.

491
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,526
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

492
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,868
That's way too simple for these jokers.

493
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,649
We're gonna whup
that nigger lover to death.

494
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,521
And I'm gonna personally strip
and clip that garboon myself.

495
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:10,975
Damn…

496
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,031
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.

497
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,196
We ready, or what?

498
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:20,295
Ah hold on, I'm fuckin'
with my eye holes.

499
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:22,536
Oh shit.

500
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,825
I just made it worse.

501
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,860
Who made this goddamn shit?

502
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,976
Willard's wife.

503
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:29,990
Wеll mаkе yоu оwn gоddаmn mаѕkѕ!

504
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:33,906
Look, nobody's sayin' they
don't appreciate what Jenny did.

505
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:36,469
Well if all I hadda do
was cut a hole in a bag,

506
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:38,430
I coulda cut it better than this.

507
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,910
How 'bout you Robert, can you see?

508
00:42:41,317 --> 00:42:42,728
Not too good.

509
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:47,190
I mean, if I don't move my head,
I can see ya pretty good, more or less.

510
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,945
But when I start ridin', the bag's
moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

511
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,382
Oh shit!

512
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,421
I just made mine worse.

513
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,987
Anybody bring any extra bags?

514
00:42:58,988 --> 00:43:02,157
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

515
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:03,903
I'm just asking.

516
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,901
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

517
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,234
Oh well Shitfire!

518
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,635
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose.

519
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,500
Well I can't see in this fucking thing!

520
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,678
I can't breathe in this fucking thing,
and I can't ride in this fucking thing!

521
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,724
Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!

522
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,449
Ya know I watched my wife work all day

523
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:24,368
gettin' thirty bags to get ready
for you ungrateful sonsabitches,

524
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:27,994
and all I hear is criticize,
criticize, criticize.

525
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,689
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

526
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:33,877
Now look…

527
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,762
Let's not forget why we're here.

528
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,595
We gotta killer nigger
over that hill there.

529
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:40,595
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

530
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:41,924
Okay, I'm confused.

531
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,746
Are the bags on or off?

532
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:49,681
I think… we all think…
the bags was a nice idea.

533
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:50,712
– Yeah.
– Yeah.

534
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:54,788
But not pointing 'ny fingers,
they could have been done better.

535
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:59,036
So how about… no bags this time,

536
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:04,781
but next time, we do the bags right,
and then we go full regalia.

537
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,944
I get my bag off.

538
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,163
Wait a minute!

539
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,107
I didn't say no bags.

540
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,353
But nobody can see.

541
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:13,772
So?

542
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:16,069
So, it be nice to see.

543
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,546
Goddamit! This is a raid!

544
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:21,747
I can't see, you can't see. So what?

545
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,317
All that matters is
can the fuckin' horse see!

546
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:25,797
That's a raid!

547
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,317
Where's this shit!

548
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:33,283
There he is!

549
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,895
Get that nigger out from under 'at wagon.

550
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:38,449
And get that nigger lover
out o'the wagon!

551
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:39,746
That nigger ain't down here!

552
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:40,867
– They're gone!
– What?

553
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,689
– They tricked us!
– Well where are they?

554
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,369
Auf wiedersehen.

555
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:53,899
Bull's eye.

556
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:57,701
Look at 'em run!

557
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,468
Cowards tend to do that.

558
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,959
Goddammit!

559
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,015
Would you care to?

560
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,017
I can't see shit out of this…

561
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:30,874
He's getting away.

562
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:31,803
I got 'em.

563
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,522
Big Daddy's getting away.

564
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,129
I got 'em.

565
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:53,221
Got 'em.

566
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:00,810
The kid's a natural!

567
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:14,886
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters were German?

568
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:17,353
Broomhilda is a German name.

569
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:20,595
If they named her, it stands
to reason they'd be German.

570
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,386
Lots of gals where you from
named Broomhilda?

571
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:26,966
Brönhilde is the name of a character

572
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:30,582
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

573
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:33,228
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?

574
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,533
Oh yes, there is.

575
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,468
Do you know it?

576
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,690
Every German knows that story.

577
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,891
Would you like me to tell you?

578
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:55,269
Well…

579
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:59,684
Brünnhilde was a… princess.

580
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:06,361
She was the daughter of Wotan,
the god of all gods.

581
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:10,114
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

582
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:11,773
What she do?

583
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:16,364
I can't exactly remember.
I think she disobeys him in some way.

584
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,367
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

585
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:22,178
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

586
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,962
It's a German legend, there's always
going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

587
00:47:26,186 --> 00:47:30,183
And he puts a fire breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

588
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,373
And he surrounds her…

589
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,662
in a circle of hellfire.

590
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,442
And there, Brünnhilde shall remain,

591
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,840
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

592
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,419
Does a fella arise?

593
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:55,341
Yes Django. As a
matter of fact, he does.

594
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,886
A fella named Siegfried.

595
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,140
Does Siegfried save her?

596
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:04,055
Quite spectacularly so.

597
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,779
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

598
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:13,846
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

599
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,008
And he walks through hellfire…

600
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,672
because Brünnhilde's worth it.

601
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,376
I know how he feel.

602
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,798
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

603
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:41,371
Now… Look… Django…

604
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,212
I don't doubt that one day
you will save your lady love.

605
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,731
But I can't let you go to Greenville
in a good conscious.

606
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:58,225
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't a place for you to visit.

607
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,921
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

608
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:06,782
But let me ask you a question.

609
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,385
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

610
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,093
Kill white folks, and
they pay you for it?

611
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:22,648
What's not to like?

612
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,101
And I have to admit,
we make a good team.

613
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:28,133
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Li'le Raj?

614
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,626
Yeah, on that occasion,
you were a tad overzealous,

615
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:32,148
but normally, that's a good thing.

616
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,627
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

617
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,630
What'cha mean partner up?

618
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:41,827
You work with me through
the winter till the snow melts.

619
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,574
I give you a third of my bounties.

620
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:50,212
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

621
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:56,531
I'll take you to Greenville myself,
and we'll find where they sent your wife.

622
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:02,806
Why you care what happen to me?

623
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,540
Why you care if I find my wife?

624
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,255
Frankly…

625
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:12,312
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

626
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:16,032
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

627
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:20,937
Plus when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

628
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:26,598
As a German, I'm obliged to help you

629
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,279
on your quest to rescue
your beloved Broomhilda.

630
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:50,958
Ooh, what happened to mister
“I wanna shoot white folks for money”?

631
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,901
His son's with him.

632
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:56,018
Well good.
He'll have a loved one with him.

633
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,404
Maybe even share a last word.

634
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,639
That's better than most of them get,

635
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,029
and a damn sight better then he deserves.

636
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,141
Put down the rifle.

637
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,564
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

638
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,065
Just take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

639
00:53:26,558 --> 00:53:27,782
Read it aloud.

640
00:53:28,924 --> 00:53:30,946
Consider that today's lesson.

641
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,664
Wanted, dead or alive.

642
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,289
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall…

643
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:42,293
– Gang
– .. gang.

644
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,969
For murder and stagecoach ro…

645
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:49,652
robbery.

646
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:51,835
Seven zero zero ze-

647
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,663
Seven thousand.

648
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,499
– Seven-
– Thousand.

649
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:58,457
Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall,

650
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,621
one thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang

651
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:08,444
memb…
– members.

652
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:14,153
Known members of the Smitty
Bacall Gang are as fellows,

653
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:15,895
– follows.
– follows.

654
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:19,603
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and…

655
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:22,939
Crazy Craig Koons.

656
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,884
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

657
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:29,864
If Smitty Bacall wanted to
start a farm at twenty-two,

658
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:31,932
they would never have printed that.

659
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:35,750
But Smitty Bacall wanted
to rob stagecoaches,

660
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,643
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

661
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:42,460
D'you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

662
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,012
This is what I do.

663
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,653
I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash.

664
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,881
This corpse is worth
seven thousand dollars.

665
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:55,995
Now quit your pussyfootin'
and shoot him.

666
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:07,299
<i> Pa?</i>

667
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,768
<i>Pa!</i>

668
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,553
Here…

669
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:21,298
You need to keep
this Smitty Bacall handbill.

670
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:22,197
Why?

671
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:23,664
It's good luck.

672
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:26,523
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

673
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:16,364
That's accurate.

674
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,928
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

675
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:30,031
Who the hell have you got there?

676
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,629
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

677
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,758
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

678
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,982
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe,
and three of their acolytes.

679
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:42,357
Huh.

680
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,052
Well just leave 'em out here,
they ain't goin' nowhere.

681
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,955
Why don't ya come on in outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee?

682
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,080
Had a birthday yesterday, got some cake!

683
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,818
Pretty good.

684
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,589
Move along!

685
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,665
Do it, walk!

686
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:28,585
Keep moving.

687
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:35,124
Don't let that mud
slow you down, keep going.

688
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,265
Keep on.

689
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,956
Broomhilda Von Shaft, age twenty-seven,

690
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:00,469
“r” on right cheek…

691
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:03,810
Calvin Candie.

692
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:08,397
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

693
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,267
Candyland?

694
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:11,533
Oh so you've heard of it?

695
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:13,476
Ain't no slave that ain't
heard of Candyland.

696
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:16,124
Well, apparently
that's where you wife is,

697
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,373
and that's the repellent
gentleman who owns her.

698
00:59:19,428 --> 00:59:22,119
Let's just hope she works in the house,
not out in the field.

699
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,820
Oh no, she ain't no field nigga.

700
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,256
She… she pretty.

701
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,644
and she talk good, too.

702
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,416
But when they tore her back up,
and then they…

703
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,715
burnt that runaway “r” on her cheek…

704
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:38,410
they goddamned her.

705
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:46,521
She no field nigger, but she ain't good
enough for the house no more either.

706
00:59:46,534 --> 00:59:48,427
They're gonna try to make
her comfort girl.

707
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:50,193
What's a comfort-
Oh.

708
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,075
Not while I got freedom…

709
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,691
Not while I got my gun.

710
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,589
So do we offer to buy her?

711
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,309
So…

712
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,307
say…

713
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,536
a man wants to buy a horse…

714
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,997
needs to buy a horse.

715
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:19,553
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door,

716
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:23,005
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
And you know what the farmer says?

717
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,364
The farmer says: “No”.

718
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,317
Well I say: fuck that farmer.

719
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:31,383
And I'm stealin' that horse.

720
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:36,318
Fair enough, but now you are horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

721
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,840
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner,

722
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:40,670
because the horse is still his property.

723
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:44,359
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

724
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,154
But if we ain't gonna try to buy,
then how we gonna get her?

725
01:00:48,038 --> 01:00:51,879
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

726
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,390
Go ahead.

727
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:59,806
The man walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door,

728
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:05,913
and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm,

729
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:12,027
and makes an offer so ridiculous,
the farmer's forced to say 'yes'.

730
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:14,448
We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?

731
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:19,079
No, it's far too big, but apparently,
this farmer ain't all about the farm.

732
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,741
How much do you know
about mandingo fighting?

733
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,687
What?

734
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:28,637
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who's an expert on mandingo fighting?

735
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,828
Why?

736
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:33,913
Because my character is that of
a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

737
01:01:33,914 --> 01:01:37,294
here in Greenville to buy my way
into the mandingo fight game,

738
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:41,230
and your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

739
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,079
They call that “One-Eyed Charly”.

740
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:47,851
Bonjour.

741
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:51,111
Bonsoir, ma p'tite femme noire,

742
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,712
we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

743
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:55,585
Entrez.

744
01:01:58,242 --> 01:01:59,642
Thank you.

745
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:02,638
You want me to play a black slaver?

746
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:05,837
Ain't nothin lower than a black slaver.

747
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:09,442
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger.

748
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,420
And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.

749
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,768
Then play him that way,

750
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:19,784
give me your black slaver.

751
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,116
Dr. Schultz!

752
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:34,788
Good to see you again.

753
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,329
Mr. Moguy.

754
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:40,322
Thank you for your assistance in creating
the opportunity for this appointment.

755
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:41,898
Nonsense, it's my job.

756
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:45,674
So, this is the One-Eyed Charly
I've heard so much about.

757
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:47,705
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

758
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,797
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

759
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,607
Just call me Leo.

760
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:56,290
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room,
y'all wanna follow me?

761
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,831
How long have you
been associated with Mr. Candie?

762
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:03,126
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about eleven
when we went to boarding school together.

763
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:06,434
Calvins' father's father
put me through law school.

764
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,669
One could almost say, I was
raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

765
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,060
One could almost say, you's a nigger.

766
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,989
What did you say?

767
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:15,218
I said…

768
01:03:15,243 --> 01:03:17,343
Eh nothing, he's just being cheeky.

769
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:21,923
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

770
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,008
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

771
01:03:24,098 --> 01:03:26,008
Ah, what civilized people aren't?

772
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,477
And he prefers Monsieur
Candie to Mister Candie.

773
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:30,616
Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il préfère.

774
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:35,029
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

775
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:40,569
Get back on top now, turn around.

776
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:41,700
There you go.

777
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,616
There you go.

778
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:48,283
Why do you want to get
in the mandingo business?

779
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,146
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

780
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:58,854
Quit stalling now.
Answer the question.

781
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:02,940
The awful truth?

782
01:04:03,197 --> 01:04:04,862
Pff, I'm bored.

783
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:06,812
This seems like a good bit of fun.

784
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,250
Well, come on over.

785
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:17,132
We got us a fight goin' on,
that's a good bit of fun.

786
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,131
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

787
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,618
You don't wear a hat in a house,
white man, even I know that.

788
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,068
– Dr. Schultz…
– What a real pleasure-

789
01:04:45,076 --> 01:04:46,689
Keep fighting, niggers!

790
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:48,306
.. and I might add, an honor.

791
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:51,889
Honored to meet you, please have
a seat, the pleasure's all mine.

792
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,651
Get Freeman Django here
whatever he wants.

793
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:57,199
And I'll have a sweet tea and bourbon.

794
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,698
Use your weight, boy,
use your weight! There you go!

795
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,568
He's much bigger and stronger!

796
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,524
Com'on now!

797
01:05:24,684 --> 01:05:27,484
Ah, he's not doing what I told him.
For God's sake.

798
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:31,327
Bravo, Luigi, cosi e dai.
Dai casse piu rapido.

799
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,289
Com'on now boys,
this a fight to the death!

800
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:37,271
You either hit him or you're ain't!

801
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,226
Ecco i con la spola tappeto.
La spola tappeto giù.

802
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:47,577
Big Fred, com'on!

803
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:50,091
Turn him around, now!

804
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:55,660
Use your strength, boy!

805
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,259
Com'on now, use your strength!

806
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:01,846
There you go!

807
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:04,617
There you go!

808
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:05,808
Look at that!

809
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,829
– Com'on, com'on, Luigi, com'on!
– Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.

810
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:12,065
Do what I told you, boy.

811
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:13,282
There you go!

812
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:15,306
Ah. No! Aah!

813
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:18,210
Do what I told you.
Ground him back, boy.

814
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,475
Ground him back!

815
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,715
Uh, you no lose!

816
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:45,683
Finish him.

817
01:06:49,642 --> 01:06:51,462
Go on, boy, finish him!

818
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:57,519
That's why they call him big Fred!

819
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,261
Worth every penny.

820
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:01,050
Well, arrivederchi, Luigi!

821
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:03,605
Com'on up now boy, get yourself a rest,

822
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:06,469
you did a fine job, a real fine job.

823
01:07:06,894 --> 01:07:08,894
Mercedes.

824
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,226
Tequila.

825
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,437
What's your name?

826
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:46,208
Django.

827
01:07:48,757 --> 01:07:50,577
Can you spell it?

828
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:56,513
D, J, A, N, G, O.

829
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,021
The D is silent.

830
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,277
I know.

831
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:09,393
Umberto, andiamo.

832
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,576
Mr. Moguy,

833
01:08:10,742 --> 01:08:12,784
I want you to take care
o' my new boy here.

834
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:14,930
You find him a room with a soft bed,

835
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:17,472
and you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

836
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:20,591
You be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow mornin' now, you hear?

837
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:21,489
Yessir, Mr. Candie.

838
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:25,347
Oh before you go, Roscoe,
get Fred here a tall beer.

839
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,978
You enjoy that, boy.

840
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,603
You've earned it.

841
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,810
Yessir.

842
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:44,782
What's your name, boy?

843
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,016
His name is Django Freeman.

844
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:48,529
Hm-hm.

845
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:52,242
Where did ya dig him up?

846
01:08:52,269 --> 01:08:56,008
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

847
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,469
I've heard tell about you.

848
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,176
I heard you've been telling ev'rybody
them mandingos are no damn good,

849
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:06,543
ain't nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying, I'm curious.

850
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:09,994
What makes you such a mandingo expert?

851
01:09:11,638 --> 01:09:14,338
I'm curious what makes you so curious?

852
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:19,485
– What did you say, boy?
– Calm down Butch.

853
01:09:20,643 --> 01:09:22,121
No offense given…

854
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:23,736
None taken.

855
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,330
Uh, Monsieur Candie…

856
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:29,554
Uhm, I'd appreciate if you could direct
your line of inquiry toward me.

857
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:30,729
One.

858
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:34,775
You do not have anything to drink,
can I get you a tasty refreshment?

859
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:36,744
Yes! I'll have a beer.

860
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:37,831
Wunderbar.

861
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:40,036
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,

862
01:09:40,046 --> 01:09:43,442
and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver,
do no spare the rum.

863
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:45,148
Doc…

864
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,872
I'm a seasoned slaver, you are-
well, you are a neophyte,

865
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:54,730
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this
cowboy here is taking advantage of you.

866
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,329
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie,

867
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,223
I didn't seek you out for your advice.

868
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,846
I sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.

869
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:10,171
I was under the impression
when you granted me an audience,

870
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:12,532
it would be to discuss business.

871
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,410
Well, we weren't talking business yet.

872
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,756
We were discussing my curiosity.

873
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,158
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

874
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,427
Sheba,

875
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:31,604
you stay right there.

876
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,078
I know you didn't mean me.

877
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,454
Prost.

878
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:37,823
German.

879
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,170
Now according to Moguy,

880
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:44,881
if I do business with you,
I'm doin' business with both o' y'all.

881
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,469
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold, is that it?

882
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:52,030
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

883
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:54,908
So…

884
01:10:55,457 --> 01:10:56,857
Bright Boy,

885
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:59,485
Moguy tells me you looked
over my African flesh,

886
01:10:59,486 --> 01:11:01,401
and you was none too impressed, huh?

887
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:03,305
Not for top dollar.

888
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,348
Well then we got nothing
more to talk about.

889
01:11:07,357 --> 01:11:09,425
You see, you wanna buy
a beat ass nigger from me,

890
01:11:09,507 --> 01:11:12,081
those was all the beat ass
niggers I wanna sell, so…

891
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,616
He don't wanna buy
the niggers you wanna sell.

892
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:17,944
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

893
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:22,522
I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

894
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,420
Well, hm. You won't sell your best.

895
01:11:28,457 --> 01:11:30,979
You won't even sell your second best.

896
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:34,955
But your third best
you don't want to sell him either…

897
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:38,926
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it…

898
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:42,793
who knows what could happen?

899
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:46,686
And what do you consider ridiculous?

900
01:11:47,398 --> 01:11:51,981
For a truly talented specimen,
well “The Right Nigger”?

901
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,318
How much would you say, Django?

902
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,500
Twelve thousand dollars.

903
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:06,606
Gentlemen…

904
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:08,772
You had my curiosity.

905
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:11,102
Now you have my attention.

906
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:27,140
Willie… Willie.

907
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:29,007
Hold up! Hold up.

908
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:30,331
Aah.

909
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,057
Good morning, gentlemen.

910
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:35,204
Good Dr. Schultz.
Beautiful morning isn't it?

911
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,298
You couldn't have picked a better one.

912
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:40,360
Please, won't you take a ride
with us here in the Victorian.

913
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:42,068
Oh, thank you very much.

914
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:44,270
Tie your horse up back there.

915
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:53,464
Django!

916
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,825
Well I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues,

917
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,124
cause I believe
there's a level above bright,

918
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:11,155
above talented, above loyal
that a nigger can aspire to.

919
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:16,664
Say one nigger that just
pops up in ten thousand.

920
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,531
The exceptional nigger.

921
01:13:19,412 --> 01:13:21,261
Bright day uh, Bright Boy?

922
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,798
Sun is up.

923
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,574
Shinin' on all of us.

924
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:33,277
Have a seat, Doc.

925
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:35,943
Quite an honor.

926
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:37,388
The honor is all ours.

927
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:38,091
Thank you.

928
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:41,351
<i>.. but I do
believe that, given time,</i>

929
01:13:41,352 --> 01:13:44,433
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here,

930
01:13:45,348 --> 01:13:47,470
will come if not frequent…

931
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:49,645
more frequent…

932
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:53,011
Bright Boy,

933
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,962
you are that one in ten thousand.

934
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:59,634
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

935
01:14:15,188 --> 01:14:16,512
Touch your guns, you die.

936
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:18,341
Everybody calm down!

937
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:20,940
I saw the whole thing, no harm done.

938
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:22,633
Are you- are you
kiddin' me, this nigger-

939
01:14:22,664 --> 01:14:26,164
I said no harm done!
Now take your hand off your pistol!

940
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,916
Butch!

941
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,070
That means you too.

942
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,653
Ev'rybody stop antagonizing my guests.

943
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:37,230
Hoot!

944
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:39,119
Git back upon your horse.

945
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:40,871
He broke my collarbone!

946
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:45,572
For God sake, somebody please help Hoot
here back upon his goddamn horse.

947
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:48,631
Aw, now you are one lucky nigger.

948
01:14:49,858 --> 01:14:51,683
You got to listen to
your boss, white boy.

949
01:14:51,684 --> 01:14:54,241
Oh I'm a good walkin' in
the moonlight for you.

950
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:56,145
You wanna hold my hand?

951
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:05,215
Willie!
Take us home.

952
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,549
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

953
01:16:04,654 --> 01:16:05,668
No sir.

954
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:08,134
You wan' a boot heel in it?

955
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:09,504
No sir.

956
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,922
Then keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

957
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:16,125
Flash that bad look at me again,
I give you a reason not to like me.

958
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,360
Now move, nigger!

959
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,925
You niggers gonna understand
somethin' 'bout me.

960
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:23,938
I'm worse than any o'these white men here.

961
01:16:24,235 --> 01:16:27,571
You get the molasses out yo' ass, and
you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.

962
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:31,053
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?

963
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:32,405
Indeed!

964
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:38,252
May you stop for a moment,
so I may put put a word in my man's ear?

965
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,249
Yeah, I'm expecting to fall in love once
I see the specimens at Candyland,

966
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,662
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

967
01:16:45,663 --> 01:16:49,723
a confidential strategy
meeting with my… confidant.

968
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:54,829
You mind tellin' me
what the hell you doing?

969
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,439
I've confirmed that
Broomhilda's at Candyland.

970
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:02,331
You sure it's her?

971
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:04,872
He didn't call her by name,
but she's a young lady,

972
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:06,848
whip marks on her
back, and speaks German.

973
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,362
Now while it's not wise to assume,

974
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,891
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

975
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:13,301
Point being…

976
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:16,476
don't get so carried away
with your retribution.

977
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:18,558
You lose sight on why we're here.

978
01:17:18,642 --> 01:17:20,081
You think I lost sight, of that?

979
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:23,070
Yes, I do! Stop antagonizing Candie!

980
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:28,639
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get os both killed,

981
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:33,410
and I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.

982
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:36,384
I'm not antagonizing.
I'm intriguing him.

983
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:39,405
You you're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves!

984
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,006
I recall the man…

985
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:45,762
who had me killed another
man in front o' his son,

986
01:17:45,848 --> 01:17:47,205
and he didn't bat an eye.

987
01:17:49,056 --> 01:17:50,456
Ya r'member that?

988
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:53,763
Yeah of course I remember!

989
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:55,273
What you said was…

990
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,827
You said “this is my world…

991
01:17:58,355 --> 01:18:00,194
and in my world, you got to get dirty”.

992
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,071
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm getting dirty.

993
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,013
Well you're paraphrasing a tad, but…

994
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:14,609
that was the generally gist…

995
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:20,243
see you at Candyland.

996
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:28,704
Alright niggers!

997
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,199
Back at it.

998
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:33,476
That means you too, moonlight.

999
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,262
Well I'll 'be! D'Artagnan!

1000
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,954
Now boy, why do a fool thing
like run off?

1001
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:29,595
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1002
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,247
Yes you can!

1003
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,733
Yоu mіght nоt bе аblе tо wіn,
but yоur аѕѕ саn fіght.

1004
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:36,979
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up,

1005
01:19:37,017 --> 01:19:38,588
I cannot hear myself think!

1006
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:43,405
Hush now, Marsha! Hush up, Marsha!
Marsha, hush up!

1007
01:19:43,555 --> 01:19:46,897
Hey, get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1008
01:19:56,075 --> 01:19:57,895
Well now boy…

1009
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,742
Gidown o' that tree.
– Yes sir.

1010
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:25,251
How long was he lose?

1011
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,163
A night…

1012
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:28,971
day…

1013
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:30,895
Half the other night.

1014
01:20:32,388 --> 01:20:33,999
How far he git off property?

1015
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,880
'Bout twenty miles off prop.

1016
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:38,638
Pretty fer, consid'rin' that limp he got.

1017
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:44,236
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1018
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,783
One of this new lot.

1019
01:20:47,345 --> 01:20:50,231
The way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.

1020
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:53,142
Please Mr. Candie,
I ain't got it in me no more, I can't-

1021
01:20:53,143 --> 01:20:56,164
No no no no, now no beggin'…

1022
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,117
No playin' on my soft heart.

1023
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:04,979
You're in trouble, now son.
– Yessir.

1024
01:21:09,206 --> 01:21:12,006
I done paid 500 dollars for you…

1025
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,688
When I pay 500 dollars…

1026
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:19,389
I expect to get five fights outta a nigga
'fore he rollover and play dead.

1027
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:22,949
Got to understand, I'm…
I'm running a business here!

1028
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,434
You- you fought three fights.

1029
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:26,830
But I won ev'ry one!

1030
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:28,469
Yes you did. Yes you did,

1031
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,424
but that last one, you muddled the line
between winning and losing.

1032
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,998
Still the fact remain.

1033
01:21:37,538 --> 01:21:40,745
I pay 500 dollars,
I want five goddamn fights!

1034
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:43,434
So what 'bout my
five hundred dollars, huh?

1035
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:47,333
What about my five hundred dollars?

1036
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:50,722
You goin' reimburse me?!

1037
01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:59,813
You even know what reimburse means?

1038
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,349
I'll reimburse you!

1039
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:14,418
You will?

1040
01:22:15,343 --> 01:22:16,543
Yup.

1041
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:21,544
You'll pay 500 dollars…

1042
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:26,160
for pratic'lly a one eyed Ole'Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1043
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,716
No, he won't.

1044
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:31,728
He's just tired of you
toyin' with him, is all.

1045
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:34,306
Matter o' fact, so am I.

1046
01:22:35,276 --> 01:22:37,372
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny,

1047
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:39,568
ain't got no use for 'em,
ain't that right, Doc?

1048
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,123
You heard 'em!

1049
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:56,159
I'm gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher slack jawed gaze, he…

1050
01:22:56,373 --> 01:22:59,002
he ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life.

1051
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,548
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1052
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,441
That right.

1053
01:23:06,392 --> 01:23:07,512
For that matter…

1054
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:11,077
nor I have.

1055
01:23:16,645 --> 01:23:17,765
Now…

1056
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:22,031
Seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here…

1057
01:23:24,474 --> 01:23:27,745
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger anyway I see fit?

1058
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,420
He's your nigger.

1059
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,812
Mr. Stonesipher?

1060
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,755
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1061
01:23:41,594 --> 01:23:44,685
Marsha! Git the nigger!

1062
01:24:23,337 --> 01:24:25,481
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1063
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,994
for a blood sport like 'nigger fightin'?

1064
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:29,293
No.

1065
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:32,893
He just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

1066
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,002
You are used to it?

1067
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:40,737
I'm just a little more use
to Americans than he is.

1068
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:44,413
Now… Monsieur Candie,

1069
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:46,624
whenever you're ready.

1070
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:49,731
We rode five hours so you could
show off your stock.

1071
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:52,216
Let's git to it.

1072
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,612
Cause as of now, if he's an example…

1073
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:57,225
I ain't impressed.

1074
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:01,363
Follow me.

1075
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:00,631
<i>Line up to the left here now niggers.</i>

1076
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,860
<i>That's it.</i>

1077
01:27:09,698 --> 01:27:11,578
<i>You gimme a line, gimme a line.</i>

1078
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:14,317
<i>Get in line here. Right now!</i>

1079
01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:15,070
Hello, Steven my boy!

1080
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:17,356
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.

1081
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:20,710
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1082
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:23,061
Oh Steven, you have
nails for breakfast!?

1083
01:28:23,075 --> 01:28:25,866
What's the matter, why so ornery,
you miss me, huh?

1084
01:28:25,896 --> 01:28:30,014
Ohoh yes sir, I miss you like
a hog miss slop,

1085
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:34,176
like a - like a- a baby
miss Mammie's titty,

1086
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:39,047
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1087
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,710
Now I ask you:
who this nigger on that nag?

1088
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:46,662
Hey Snowball.

1089
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,880
You wanna know my name
or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1090
01:28:52,475 --> 01:28:55,199
Just who the hell you
callin' Snowball, horse boy?

1091
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:57,881
I'll snap your black ass of
that nag there in the mud-

1092
01:28:57,882 --> 01:29:00,612
so fast it make your head spin.
– Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven.

1093
01:29:01,162 --> 01:29:02,598
Let's keep it funny.

1094
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:04,645
Django here is a Freeman.

1095
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,344
– This nigger here?
– That nigger there.

1096
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:09,967
Let me at least introduce the two of you.

1097
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:14,120
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Steven.

1098
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,917
Steven, this here's Django.

1099
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,591
You two ought to hate each other.

1100
01:29:17,756 --> 01:29:21,863
Calvin, just who the hell is this
nigger you feels the need to entertain?

1101
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:25,769
Django, and his friend in grey
here Dr. Schultz, are customers,

1102
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:27,618
and they are our guests, Steven,

1103
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:31,468
and you, you old decrepit bastard,
are to show them every hospitality.

1104
01:29:31,507 --> 01:29:33,753
You understand that?
– Yessir, him I understand,

1105
01:29:33,758 --> 01:29:36,127
but I don't know why I gotta
take lip off this nigger?

1106
01:29:36,161 --> 01:29:38,761
You don't hafta know why.
Do you understand?

1107
01:29:39,263 --> 01:29:41,229
Yes sir, I understand.

1108
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:42,443
Oh good!

1109
01:29:42,471 --> 01:29:45,892
They're spendin' the night, go up in
the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1110
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,581
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1111
01:29:48,647 --> 01:29:50,995
Steven, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1112
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:52,395
In the Big House?

1113
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,804
Well you gotta problem with that?

1114
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:56,160
No, no no I got no problem with it,

1115
01:29:56,215 --> 01:29:58,817
if you ain't gotta problem with burnin'
the bed, the sheets, the pillow cases,

1116
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:01,156
ev'rything up when this
black ass motherfucker's gone!

1117
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,166
Now that is my problem,
they are mine to burn!

1118
01:30:03,305 --> 01:30:05,723
Now your problem right now
is making a good impression.

1119
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:07,920
And I want you to start
solving that problem right now,

1120
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:09,984
and git them goddamn rooms ready!

1121
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,989
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1122
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:16,262
Go on now.

1123
01:30:16,504 --> 01:30:20,354
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay
in the Big House. Your daddy rollin' over

1124
01:30:20,355 --> 01:30:22,111
in his goddamn grave right now.
– Quite the lip on him!

1125
01:30:22,112 --> 01:30:24,323
– Put a nigger in the estate part,
– Phew! Getting worse and worse!

1126
01:30:24,324 --> 01:30:25,744
– what shit is that!?
– Now!

1127
01:30:26,099 --> 01:30:30,393
Where is my beautiful sister!!

1128
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:32,384
There she is!!

1129
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:39,303
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
southern belle is my widowed sister.

1130
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:43,610
Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1131
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:48,211
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1132
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:51,764
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie,
you'll git your ass up on that pen.

1133
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:53,139
Com'on Charlie, go on now.

1134
01:30:53,162 --> 01:30:55,144
Go, com'on now.
You know where it is.

1135
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,009
Like you're on the run!

1136
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:00,696
Niggers don't walk 'round here!
Niggers run!

1137
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,623
– Ah, Monsieur Candie?
– Hmm?

1138
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,765
About that matter, about the nigger gal
we were talking about?

1139
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:09,804
Nigger gal?

1140
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:13,208
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German?

1141
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,780
Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?

1142
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:20,416
Do you think before the demonstration
you could send her around to my room?

1143
01:31:20,806 --> 01:31:23,077
You little Dickens, you!

1144
01:31:23,403 --> 01:31:24,603
I don't see why not.

1145
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:27,958
Steven, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1146
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,446
get her cleaned up and smellin' real nice,
and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room.

1147
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:36,176
Actually, Monsieur Candie, it's-
it's somethin' I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1148
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:37,012
What?

1149
01:31:37,097 --> 01:31:39,712
Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.

1150
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,024
What's she doin' there?

1151
01:31:43,117 --> 01:31:46,782
What 'cha think she doin' there,
in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.

1152
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,844
– What did she do?
– She run off again.

1153
01:31:49,902 --> 01:31:53,065
Jesus Christ Steven, how many
people ran away while I was gone?

1154
01:31:53,112 --> 01:31:54,018
Two.

1155
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:55,498
And when did she go?

1156
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:58,581
Last night, they- they
brung her back this morning.

1157
01:31:58,785 --> 01:32:01,243
How bad did Stonesipher's
dogs tear her up?

1158
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,301
Lucky for her, they was
out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1159
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,418
Bill and Cody went out lookin' for her,
found her and brought her back, uh…

1160
01:32:09,878 --> 01:32:11,209
Now she a little beat up,

1161
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:14,250
but- but she done that t' her all damn self,
runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.

1162
01:32:14,251 --> 01:32:16,041
How long she been in the box?

1163
01:32:16,054 --> 01:32:19,044
How long ya think, she been
in there all damn day!

1164
01:32:19,177 --> 01:32:22,284
And the li'le bitch got ten
more days be in there.

1165
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,845
Still, take her out.

1166
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,207
Take her out, why?!

1167
01:32:25,293 --> 01:32:27,254
Because I said so, that's why.

1168
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:30,135
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1169
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:33,735
Hildi is my nigger, Southern hospitality
dictates I make her available to him.

1170
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,119
But Monsieur Candie, she run off!

1171
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,711
Jesus Christ Steven, what is the point
of havin' a nigger that speaks German,

1172
01:32:39,797 --> 01:32:42,277
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1173
01:32:42,381 --> 01:32:46,450
Now I realize it is inconvenient
but still, you take her ass out!

1174
01:32:46,591 --> 01:32:47,442
Yes sir.

1175
01:32:49,058 --> 01:32:52,329
Lara Lee, will you and Cora
be responsible for getting

1176
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:55,349
Hildi cleaned up and
presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1177
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:56,784
Of course, darling.

1178
01:32:56,829 --> 01:33:02,024
Now gentlemen, I do apologize, but I'm
weary for our travels beyond words,

1179
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:04,893
it is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1180
01:33:09,604 --> 01:33:12,389
Ya'all have heard the man,
get her ass up outta there!

1181
01:33:12,819 --> 01:33:14,546
Cora! Come here!

1182
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:18,410
Get over there, get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to doctor

1183
01:33:18,418 --> 01:33:20,337
what- what did you say
your name is, Schut?

1184
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:21,847
– Schultz.
– Schultz!

1185
01:33:22,236 --> 01:33:24,022
Git her back over here, alright girl?

1186
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:25,469
Yes sir.

1187
01:34:43,464 --> 01:34:47,102
Hey, you comin’ with me, or's you
gonna sleep in that li'le box over yonder?

1188
01:36:22,137 --> 01:36:23,594
Hello ladies.

1189
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:27,170
Dr. Schultz, may I introduce
to you Broomhilda.

1190
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,409
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1191
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,566
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Broomhilda.

1192
01:36:38,603 --> 01:36:40,931
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1193
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:44,502
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't you know?

1194
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,443
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1195
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:53,427
I could see all the passions
you inspire completely justified.

1196
01:36:57,632 --> 01:36:59,732
The doctor here speaks German!

1197
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,099
And I've been informed you do as well?

1198
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:07,486
Go ahead girl, speak a little German.

1199
01:37:15,937 --> 01:37:17,483
Astonishing.

1200
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:27,313
– And I should bring-
– Much obliged.

1201
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:02,293
Don't be afraid.

1202
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:42,939
Pardon.

1203
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:38,958
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

1204
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:50,444
You silver tongued devil you.

1205
01:40:52,069 --> 01:40:52,969
Hurry up, girl!

1206
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:53,970
Ev'rything's there, miss Cora.

1207
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:55,085
No no no, they're drinking tonight.

1208
01:40:55,134 --> 01:40:57,019
Go downstairs, get the
big jug with the red stuff

1209
01:40:57,044 --> 01:40:58,144
mister Candie like, hear?
– Yeah, yeah- yes ma'm,

1210
01:40:58,145 --> 01:41:00,145
I know what we're talkin' 'bout.
– Too big, put ya'ass out o'the way.

1211
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:01,770
You know you like it.

1212
01:41:02,095 --> 01:41:03,695
That's 'cause you knows what I like!

1213
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:06,320
Ooh! Com'on with these biscuits, girl!

1214
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:12,238
Look Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1215
01:41:12,605 --> 01:41:15,423
But the best three, by far, were:

1216
01:41:15,751 --> 01:41:17,009
Sampson…

1217
01:41:17,648 --> 01:41:19,608
Well, what's his name again?
– Goldie.

1218
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:22,872
Goldie… and Eskimo Joe.

1219
01:41:23,505 --> 01:41:25,760
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1220
01:41:25,827 --> 01:41:29,237
Oh, you never know how these
nigger nicknames get started.

1221
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:32,873
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold, who knows?

1222
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,253
Well, regardless,

1223
01:41:37,787 --> 01:41:39,409
Sampson's your best,

1224
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:40,995
we all know that,

1225
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:45,117
you will never sell him,
and I can see why, he's a champion.

1226
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,742
Hmhm-hm!
All three are champions.

1227
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:51,123
Sampson's a champion.

1228
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:53,820
Them other two pretty good.

1229
01:41:54,884 --> 01:41:56,554
Calvin, what that nigger- you let-

1230
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:57,773
That's alright, that's alright.

1231
01:41:57,844 --> 01:41:59,802
You have to understand Monsieur Candie,

1232
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:03,607
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1233
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:07,749
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1234
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:09,145
Is that right?

1235
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:13,450
Hence… I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1236
01:42:14,777 --> 01:42:17,166
I need something
more than just a big nigger.

1237
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:21,235
He needs to have… panache.

1238
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,850
Need to have what what what?
– Panache, uhm…

1239
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:27,575
– A sense of showmanship!
– Showmanship, yes.

1240
01:42:27,612 --> 01:42:31,359
I want to be able to bill him
him as the “Black Hercules”.

1241
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:34,497
Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1242
01:42:34,545 --> 01:42:36,003
More like “Nigga-les”.

1243
01:42:40,306 --> 01:42:45,573
I would pay top dollar
for “The Right Nigger”.

1244
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:50,144
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger per se…

1245
01:42:50,944 --> 01:42:53,488
but is he right as rain?

1246
01:42:54,814 --> 01:42:57,999
Dr. Schultz,
I will have you know,

1247
01:42:58,065 --> 01:43:01,195
there is no one in the nigger
fight game that appreciates

1248
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:04,334
the value of showmanship more
than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.

1249
01:43:04,342 --> 01:43:05,342
Nobody.

1250
01:43:05,694 --> 01:43:09,184
But one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game.

1251
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:12,343
And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1252
01:43:12,781 --> 01:43:16,797
Now that should be your first, second,
third, four, and fifth concern.

1253
01:43:16,835 --> 01:43:19,382
Now after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1254
01:43:19,435 --> 01:43:22,585
then you can start to
implement a grand design.

1255
01:43:23,504 --> 01:43:26,105
In other words, first thing is first.

1256
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,285
First thing is first.

1257
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:39,416
I see you two gettin' on.

1258
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:41,323
Famously.

1259
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:44,312
Oh Monsieur Candie, you can't
imagine what it's like

1260
01:43:44,313 --> 01:43:47,758
not to hear you native
tongue in four years.

1261
01:43:48,012 --> 01:43:50,673
Well hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.

1262
01:43:52,241 --> 01:43:55,498
Two weeks in Boston,
oh that's your- oh man!

1263
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:58,633
Ah, two weeks in Boston!

1264
01:43:58,996 --> 01:44:04,462
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1265
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:08,948
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1266
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,108
Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,

1267
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:13,801
you might have caught yourself
a little dose of Nigga'love.

1268
01:44:14,138 --> 01:44:16,403
Nigga'love's a powerful emotion, boy.

1269
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:20,001
It's like a pool of black tar,
once it catches your ass, you' caught-

1270
01:44:20,071 --> 01:44:21,876
Yessir, you caught.

1271
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:27,728
I don't know doctor, you can lay
on all the German sweet talk you want, but

1272
01:44:27,776 --> 01:44:30,536
it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1273
01:44:34,302 --> 01:44:40,292
Well… naturally, it is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1274
01:44:40,383 --> 01:44:42,784
not the plucked chicken.

1275
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,246
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself,

1276
01:44:46,264 --> 01:44:48,372
you are quite a dapper European gentleman.

1277
01:44:48,396 --> 01:44:51,678
<i>You gotta finish this, you got to put your
elbow in this, this is, do you hear me-</i>

1278
01:44:51,728 --> 01:44:54,124
You know that nigger, don't ya?

1279
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:56,218
– Who?
– Who?

1280
01:44:56,294 --> 01:44:59,057
Don't 'who' me bitch,
you know who I'm talking about!?

1281
01:45:01,078 --> 01:45:02,368
At the table?

1282
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,720
I don't know him.

1283
01:45:04,888 --> 01:45:06,107
You don't know him?

1284
01:45:06,606 --> 01:45:07,656
No.

1285
01:45:07,874 --> 01:45:09,054
No what?

1286
01:45:09,334 --> 01:45:10,741
No sir.

1287
01:45:15,544 --> 01:45:17,422
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?

1288
01:45:22,134 --> 01:45:23,342
Okay…

1289
01:45:25,007 --> 01:45:27,911
If- if you says so.

1290
01:45:34,003 --> 01:45:37,320
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1291
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:40,409
But if it was my money…

1292
01:45:42,053 --> 01:45:44,105
I wouldn't pay no twelve
thousand dollars for him.

1293
01:45:44,408 --> 01:45:46,293
What would your price be?

1294
01:45:46,885 --> 01:45:48,870
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,

1295
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:52,174
and I don't know why I would
be inclined to be generous…

1296
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:54,360
nine thousand…

1297
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:56,832
maybe.

1298
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,125
Dr. Schultz…

1299
01:45:59,709 --> 01:46:03,644
Let me reclarify how this
whole negotiation came about.

1300
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:06,235
You see, it wasn't me who came
to you to sell a nigger.

1301
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:07,032
Sure, it wasn't.

1302
01:46:07,033 --> 01:46:09,244
It was you who
approached me to buy one.

1303
01:46:09,245 --> 01:46:10,011
Sure it was.

1304
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,733
Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,

1305
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:15,769
that ain't too far off from right, and
if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,

1306
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:17,525
I could do so any day of the week.

1307
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:18,566
Any day.

1308
01:46:18,982 --> 01:46:21,104
But like you said in Greenville doctor,

1309
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:22,963
I don't wanna sell 'em.

1310
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,531
It was only your ridiculous offer

1311
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:29,636
of twelve thousand dollars
that made me even consider it.

1312
01:46:29,652 --> 01:46:31,052
Hmm-hmm.

1313
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:43,311
You know Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1314
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:52,137
Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!

1315
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:55,393
Hurray, doctor, hurray,
and a wise decision, that is!

1316
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:58,866
However, that is a tremendous
amount of money.

1317
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,338
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,
I have a lawyer,

1318
01:47:02,387 --> 01:47:04,377
a persnickety man named Tuttle,

1319
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:07,694
and I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1320
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:11,705
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1321
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:15,390
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe
examined by a physician of my choosing.

1322
01:47:15,444 --> 01:47:16,844
Naturally.

1323
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:21,097
So say I return in about…

1324
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:25,790
.. five days time.
Five days ?!

1325
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:28,826
With my Mr. Tuttle.
And then my Mr. Tuttle

1326
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,340
and your Mr. Moguy can hash out
the finer details between themselves.

1327
01:47:33,474 --> 01:47:36,339
I say splendid Doctor… Splendid.

1328
01:47:37,152 --> 01:47:38,552
Gentlemen…

1329
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:40,928
may I propose a toast…

1330
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:47,468
to Eskimo Joe.
Or, shall we call him

1331
01:47:47,778 --> 01:47:49,598
the Black Hercules!

1332
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,656
To the Black Hercules.

1333
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:53,019
The Black Hercules!

1334
01:47:53,277 --> 01:47:54,779
The Black Hercules…

1335
01:47:54,844 --> 01:47:58,060
You was right, Doctor,
that name do have “payn-ass”.

1336
01:48:00,388 --> 01:48:01,788
Hildi…

1337
01:48:02,218 --> 01:48:03,456
I'm outta drink, girl.

1338
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:10,952
So Hildi… how you like servin'
at the big table in the big house, huh?

1339
01:48:11,957 --> 01:48:14,689
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1340
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:17,121
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1341
01:48:17,139 --> 01:48:18,045
Hmm-hmm.

1342
01:48:18,102 --> 01:48:20,016
It's a lot better than
sizzling in that hot box,

1343
01:48:20,235 --> 01:48:22,335
or draggin' your ass
through a bramble bush.

1344
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:25,722
Maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all 'em mandingos,

1345
01:48:25,753 --> 01:48:27,652
huh sugar bears?
– Hmm oh, she like them niggers.

1346
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,213
– Like Sampson, huh?
– Yessir.

1347
01:48:30,549 --> 01:48:32,210
– You know Monsieur Candie,
– Hmm?

1348
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:35,924
The doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1349
01:48:35,948 --> 01:48:39,234
since how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1350
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:41,936
Dr. Schultz, when you
was alone with Hildi here,

1351
01:48:41,959 --> 01:48:45,255
did- didja just speak German, or
did ya getta take her clothes off?

1352
01:48:45,287 --> 01:48:47,087
No, we just talked and…

1353
01:48:47,138 --> 01:48:49,144
Oh so- so you haven't seen her back?

1354
01:48:49,336 --> 01:48:50,324
I haven't-

1355
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:53,529
No no no, no, Steven's right,
you might find this interesting.

1356
01:48:53,589 --> 01:48:57,219
Hildi, com'on take off your dress,
show Dr. Schultz your back here, go on!

1357
01:48:57,258 --> 01:49:01,263
Uh, Calvin, I just got her all
dressed up and looking nice.

1358
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:05,784
But… Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from
Dusseldorf,they don't got niggers there.

1359
01:49:05,993 --> 01:49:07,474
He's a man of medicine.

1360
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:10,537
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers endurance for pain.

1361
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:14,089
These niggers are tough
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1362
01:49:14,176 --> 01:49:16,595
Hilda's got somethin' like
four lashes on her back.

1363
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:18,954
Lare Lee, just get one n' she'd just-
lose her goddamn mind!

1364
01:49:18,986 --> 01:49:21,091
Look a' that, doctor, it's like
a painting, look at that.

1365
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,190
Calvin!

1366
01:49:23,096 --> 01:49:26,181
We are eating, ain't no one
wanna look at her whipped up back!

1367
01:49:28,197 --> 01:49:30,241
Fine. Fine, fine fine fine…

1368
01:49:30,507 --> 01:49:32,981
After the dinner, Steven.
After dinner.

1369
01:49:34,216 --> 01:49:35,715
During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?

1370
01:49:42,147 --> 01:49:44,247
Cora, come get this girl!

1371
01:49:47,196 --> 01:49:49,498
– She' a mess.
– Yes ma'am?

1372
01:49:49,951 --> 01:49:51,965
Oh! Why are you all undone?

1373
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:54,676
I just got you done up,
now come over, here!

1374
01:50:01,077 --> 01:50:04,981
Baby, you got Steven his bad side,
when you need to be on his blind side.

1375
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,168
You said you ain't know him?

1376
01:50:08,197 --> 01:50:09,332
Huh?

1377
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:14,451
I said… you said you ain't know him.

1378
01:50:16,316 --> 01:50:17,876
I don't.

1379
01:50:18,236 --> 01:50:19,559
Yes you do.

1380
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,985
Mister Steven…

1381
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:25,712
I don't.

1382
01:50:25,907 --> 01:50:27,707
Why is you lyin' to me?

1383
01:50:30,342 --> 01:50:31,678
I ain't.

1384
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:34,116
Then why is you cry?

1385
01:50:35,017 --> 01:50:36,382
You scarin' me.

1386
01:50:36,622 --> 01:50:38,422
Why is I'm scarin' you?

1387
01:50:39,255 --> 01:50:40,955
Because you scary.

1388
01:50:42,689 --> 01:50:49,077
<i>.. to speak German this afternoon
with Hildi, was positively soul enriching.</i>

1389
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:54,863
You stay right here.

1390
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:05,041
You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1391
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,953
Oh yes.
Yesiree Bob I did.

1392
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:15,709
In that case… allow me…
to propose another proposition.

1393
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:17,056
I'm all ears.

1394
01:51:17,183 --> 01:51:19,003
Hurry up, goddammit!

1395
01:51:19,969 --> 01:51:21,972
Monsieur Candie-
– Steven!

1396
01:51:22,434 --> 01:51:24,873
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here!

1397
01:51:25,818 --> 01:51:30,948
Uhm… sorry doctor Schultz,
my ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1398
01:51:32,308 --> 01:51:35,587
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen.

1399
01:51:36,522 --> 01:51:38,480
You mean get up outta my chair?

1400
01:51:38,618 --> 01:51:40,410
If you could manage it.

1401
01:51:40,723 --> 01:51:41,843
Why?

1402
01:51:42,135 --> 01:51:43,664
It's about dessert.

1403
01:51:43,778 --> 01:51:45,398
What about dessert?

1404
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:48,559
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1405
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,695
We're havin' white cake.

1406
01:51:50,931 --> 01:51:53,436
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1407
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:57,856
You right Monsieur Candie, you right,
I'll handle it myself.

1408
01:51:58,002 --> 01:51:59,426
Meet me in the library.

1409
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:03,073
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to them niggers,

1410
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,983
things get fucked up 'round here,
you blame me.

1411
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:06,896
Fine, fine friend Steven, I…

1412
01:52:08,107 --> 01:52:09,662
will be along momentarily.

1413
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:11,529
Yessir.

1414
01:52:12,363 --> 01:52:13,483
Well…

1415
01:52:14,176 --> 01:52:15,134
gentlemen…

1416
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:18,175
as you can see, talented as they are
no doubt in the kitchen,

1417
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:21,962
from time to time…
adult supervision is required.

1418
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:26,827
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1419
01:52:32,784 --> 01:52:34,884
You may clear the dinner service.

1420
01:52:35,809 --> 01:52:37,809
You heard'em, com'on here.

1421
01:52:38,734 --> 01:52:39,834
Hurry up, girl.

1422
01:52:39,966 --> 01:52:41,374
So Dr. Schultz…

1423
01:52:41,804 --> 01:52:44,622
Why don't you regal us
with the tale of the circus?

1424
01:52:45,418 --> 01:52:47,035
The circus!

1425
01:52:54,295 --> 01:52:56,095
What is the matter?

1426
01:53:01,404 --> 01:53:05,956
Them motherfuckers ain't here
to buy no mandingos.

1427
01:53:06,602 --> 01:53:08,058
They wants that girl.

1428
01:53:10,313 --> 01:53:13,053
Steven, what the hell
are you talkin' about, hm?

1429
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:16,477
They playin' your ass for a fool,
that what I'm talkin' bout.

1430
01:53:16,758 --> 01:53:20,123
They ain't here for
no muscle bound jimmie,

1431
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,271
they here for that girl.

1432
01:53:22,717 --> 01:53:25,278
What… what girl.
What… Hildi?

1433
01:53:25,308 --> 01:53:27,587
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?

1434
01:53:27,908 --> 01:53:30,016
Them niggers know each other.

1435
01:53:31,001 --> 01:53:32,717
He… he just bought Eskimo Joe.

1436
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,053
Did he give you any money?

1437
01:53:34,115 --> 01:53:35,209
No, not yet, but they go-

1438
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:37,722
Then he didn't buy diddly,
not yet no how.

1439
01:53:37,912 --> 01:53:43,152
But he's just about to buy who he come
here to buy, when I interrupted him.

1440
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,337
Thank you Steven.
You're welcome Calvin.

1441
01:53:51,966 --> 01:53:54,213
Whe where you gettin' all this?

1442
01:53:54,802 --> 01:53:57,489
Why would they go through all
that trouble for a nigger with a-

1443
01:53:57,490 --> 01:54:00,107
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth three hundred dollars?

1444
01:54:00,108 --> 01:54:03,746
They're doin' it cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1445
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:05,934
She probably his wife.

1446
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:10,060
Now, why that German give a fuck who that
uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,

1447
01:54:10,074 --> 01:54:12,274
I'm sure I don't know.

1448
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:16,915
If she's who they want…

1449
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:21,474
why this whole… snake oil
pitch about mandingos then?

1450
01:54:21,836 --> 01:54:24,918
You wouldn't pay no never mind
into three hundred dollar.

1451
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,249
But that twelve thousand?

1452
01:54:28,457 --> 01:54:30,644
That made you real friendly now, didn'it?

1453
01:54:33,639 --> 01:54:35,039
Yes it did.

1454
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:39,879
His wife, uh?

1455
01:54:44,652 --> 01:54:46,509
If it had been a snake…

1456
01:54:46,883 --> 01:54:48,290
I would have got beaten.

1457
01:54:51,424 --> 01:54:56,289
Those lyin'… goddamn time…

1458
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,979
wastin' sonsabitches.

1459
01:55:02,224 --> 01:55:03,784
Sonsabitches!

1460
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:08,859
.. out of New Orleans, so I had quite
a bit of practice with… theaters types.

1461
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:11,745
Oh there you are!

1462
01:55:11,845 --> 01:55:15,420
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow ran off together.

1463
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:18,831
That'd be a hell of
a note, wouldn't it?

1464
01:55:19,099 --> 01:55:20,112
Lara Lee…

1465
01:55:20,154 --> 01:55:21,971
I was just lookin' out the big window.

1466
01:55:22,045 --> 01:55:23,972
Billy Crash is out there dealin' with some

1467
01:55:23,973 --> 01:55:26,368
shady slaver try n' sellin'
a passel of ponys,

1468
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,617
would you be a dear and go out
there give them gals an eyeball.

1469
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:33,301
– Of course, brother.
– Thank you, darling.

1470
01:55:45,947 --> 01:55:49,360
Okay. Business never sleeps.

1471
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:53,054
A propos…

1472
01:55:53,202 --> 01:55:58,932
before your exit, we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1473
01:55:59,027 --> 01:56:01,309
Ah yes! Yes we were, doctor.

1474
01:56:02,028 --> 01:56:04,387
And we will again… in a moment.

1475
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,588
Who is your little friend?

1476
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,150
This is Ben…

1477
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,248
He's a Ol'Joe that…
lived around here for a long time.

1478
01:56:35,811 --> 01:56:37,911
And I do mean a long damn time.

1479
01:56:39,303 --> 01:56:40,703
Well Ben here…

1480
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:42,970
took care of my daddy…

1481
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:45,553
and my daddy's daddy…

1482
01:56:46,129 --> 01:56:48,275
till the open kill doe who one day.

1483
01:56:51,377 --> 01:56:52,859
Ol'Ben took care o'me.

1484
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:59,537
Growin'up the son of a… of a
huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1485
01:56:59,551 --> 01:57:05,541
puts a white men in contact with
a whole lot o'… black faces.

1486
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:12,336
I spent my whole life here…
right here… in Candyland…

1487
01:57:13,704 --> 01:57:17,233
surrounded… by black faces.

1488
01:57:19,546 --> 01:57:22,914
And seein' them ev'ry day,
day in day out, I…

1489
01:57:23,216 --> 01:57:24,918
I only had one question.

1490
01:57:28,987 --> 01:57:30,620
Why don't they kill us?

1491
01:57:34,727 --> 01:57:36,654
Now right up there on that porch…

1492
01:57:37,077 --> 01:57:39,568
three times a week for fifty years,

1493
01:57:39,702 --> 01:57:44,262
Ol'Ben here… would shave
my Daddy with a straight razor.

1494
01:57:45,004 --> 01:57:50,126
Now… if I was Ol'Ben, I would
have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,

1495
01:57:50,185 --> 01:57:53,925
and it wouldn't have taken me
no fifty years to do it neither.

1496
01:57:56,276 --> 01:57:57,688
But he never did.

1497
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,652
Why not?

1498
01:58:02,186 --> 01:58:03,061
You see…

1499
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:05,818
the science of phrenology…

1500
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:12,071
is crucial to understandin' the…
separation about two species.

1501
01:58:13,873 --> 01:58:16,277
In the skull of the African here…

1502
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:20,728
the area associated with submissiveness

1503
01:58:20,796 --> 01:58:25,559
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet earth.

1504
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,310
If you examine…

1505
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,690
this peace of skull here…

1506
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:56,982
you'll notice three distinct dimples.

1507
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,574
Here… here… and here.

1508
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:05,139
Now…

1509
01:59:05,449 --> 01:59:10,212
If I was holding a skull of a- of a…
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1510
01:59:10,611 --> 01:59:14,882
these three dimples would be found in the
area o'the skull most associated with…

1511
01:59:15,226 --> 01:59:16,626
creativity.

1512
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:19,324
Βut thіѕ' thе ѕkull оf Οl'Βеn.

1513
01:59:19,836 --> 01:59:23,916
And in the skull of Ol'Ben,
unburden by genius,

1514
01:59:24,513 --> 01:59:28,721
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with…

1515
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:31,075
servility.

1516
01:59:32,394 --> 01:59:33,899
Now Bright Boy…

1517
01:59:34,767 --> 01:59:37,007
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1518
01:59:39,479 --> 01:59:41,342
But if I took this hammer here…

1519
01:59:43,753 --> 01:59:45,750
and I bashed it in your skull…

1520
01:59:47,062 --> 01:59:49,445
you would have the same three dimples…

1521
01:59:50,172 --> 01:59:51,966
in the same place…

1522
01:59:53,794 --> 01:59:55,161
as Ol'Ben.

1523
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,910
Now lay your palms flat on the table top!

1524
02:00:00,008 --> 02:00:03,051
If you lift those palms off
that turtle shell table top,

1525
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:06,349
Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with
both barrels of that sawed-off!

1526
02:00:07,354 --> 02:00:10,796
There have been a latta lies said
around this diner table here tonight,

1527
02:00:10,822 --> 02:00:12,646
but that you can believe!

1528
02:00:13,647 --> 02:00:14,754
Mr. Moguy,

1529
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,618
would you be so kind as to collect the
pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?

1530
02:00:23,452 --> 02:00:24,832
Thank you ever so much.

1531
02:00:24,903 --> 02:00:26,023
Doctor.

1532
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,681
Where were we?

1533
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,459
Jackass.

1534
02:00:41,365 --> 02:00:42,804
Oh yes…

1535
02:00:43,314 --> 02:00:48,077
I do believe you were just getting ready to
make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1536
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:50,029
I am right?

1537
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,120
Right then.

1538
02:00:57,822 --> 02:00:59,321
Bring out Hildi!

1539
02:01:02,109 --> 02:01:03,229
Your way, honey.

1540
02:01:05,017 --> 02:01:07,217
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1541
02:01:07,441 --> 02:01:08,886
Lay your hands flat on that table.

1542
02:01:08,941 --> 02:01:10,761
And shut your mouth!

1543
02:01:14,597 --> 02:01:18,986
Dr. Schultz… in Greenville,
you yourself said,

1544
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:21,251
that for the “Right Nigger”
you'd be willing to pay

1545
02:01:21,267 --> 02:01:24,400
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount.

1546
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:28,053
To which, me myself said,
“What is your definition of ridiculous?”,

1547
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,920
to which you said,
“Twelve thousand dollars”.

1548
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:36,799
Now considering you all have
ridden a whole lotta miles,

1549
02:01:36,861 --> 02:01:38,641
went to a whole lotta trouble,

1550
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:43,484
and done spread a whole lotta bull,
to purchase this lovely lady right here,

1551
02:01:43,516 --> 02:01:48,810
it would appear that Broomhilda
is in fact the “Right Nigger”!

1552
02:01:49,963 --> 02:01:52,640
And if y'all wanna leave
Candyland with Broomhilda…

1553
02:01:53,829 --> 02:01:59,146
the price is twelve thousand dollars.

1554
02:01:59,539 --> 02:02:03,693
And I take it you prefer the “take it
or leave it” style of negotiating?

1555
02:02:05,615 --> 02:02:07,435
Yes I do, doctor.

1556
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:14,106
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw
County, Broomhilda here is my property.

1557
02:02:14,653 --> 02:02:19,869
And I can chose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1558
02:02:21,064 --> 02:02:27,608
And if you all think my price
for this nigger here is too steep,

1559
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:30,427
what I'm gonna desire to do is…

1560
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:37,571
take this fuckin' hammer here,
and beat her ass to death with it!

1561
02:02:37,651 --> 02:02:38,887
Right in front of both y'all!

1562
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:39,760
Ain't it good, fella?

1563
02:02:40,063 --> 02:02:44,451
Then we can examine the three
dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!

1564
02:02:44,647 --> 02:02:45,910
Now!

1565
02:02:46,043 --> 02:02:48,332
What's it gonna be, Doc?
Huh?

1566
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:50,169
What's it gonna be?

1567
02:02:50,184 --> 02:02:53,784
May I lift the hands off the table
top in order to remove my billfold?

1568
02:02:55,597 --> 02:02:56,719
Yes you may.

1569
02:03:10,578 --> 02:03:11,698
That twelve.

1570
02:03:15,826 --> 02:03:17,245
Sold!

1571
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:23,918
To the man with the exceptional beard,
and his unexceptional nigger.

1572
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:31,724
– Mr. Moguy.
– Yes Calvin?

1573
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:36,171
You make this gentleman a receipt
for twelve thousand dollar, please.

1574
02:03:36,236 --> 02:03:39,054
– Twelve thousand dollar.
– Hm.

1575
02:03:41,074 --> 02:03:43,474
It was a pleasure doin'
business with ya all.

1576
02:03:44,046 --> 02:03:45,482
Now gentlemen…

1577
02:03:46,834 --> 02:03:48,927
If you care to join me in the parlor…

1578
02:03:49,771 --> 02:03:52,074
we will be serving white cake.

1579
02:05:20,445 --> 02:05:21,997
Bravo, Calvin.

1580
02:05:24,615 --> 02:05:27,433
Excuse me… Excuse me, madam?

1581
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:31,025
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?

1582
02:05:31,269 --> 02:05:32,607
Take your hands off that harp!

1583
02:05:36,693 --> 02:05:37,813
Doctor!

1584
02:05:38,389 --> 02:05:40,688
– Doc, you can't go in there!
– Hey uh, Steven, hey!

1585
02:05:40,698 --> 02:05:43,111
– He got no business goin' in there.
– Let it be.

1586
02:05:43,806 --> 02:05:47,186
He's a little upset, that's all.
I'll handle this.

1587
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,061
White cake?

1588
02:06:15,204 --> 02:06:18,004
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1589
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:29,696
You brooding 'bout me
getting the best of ya, uh?

1590
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:35,432
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1591
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:37,026
D'Artagnan.

1592
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:41,427
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1593
02:06:42,251 --> 02:06:44,051
Come again?

1594
02:06:46,936 --> 02:06:50,785
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote “The Three Musketeers”.

1595
02:06:51,207 --> 02:06:52,618
Yes of course, doctor.

1596
02:06:52,657 --> 02:06:54,603
I figured you must be an admirer,

1597
02:06:54,613 --> 02:06:58,386
you named your slave after
his novel's lead character.

1598
02:06:59,441 --> 02:07:03,059
Now if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1599
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,350
I wonder what he would have made of it?

1600
02:07:07,344 --> 02:07:08,990
You doubt he'd approve?

1601
02:07:11,151 --> 02:07:16,180
Yes, his approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1602
02:07:18,574 --> 02:07:20,347
Soft hearted Frenchy?

1603
02:07:22,377 --> 02:07:24,377
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1604
02:07:28,469 --> 02:07:30,304
Are these Broomhilda's papers?

1605
02:07:30,414 --> 02:07:32,232
– Yes they are.
– May I?

1606
02:07:32,365 --> 02:07:34,159
– Of course!
– Thank you.

1607
02:07:36,863 --> 02:07:39,719
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1608
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:42,071
and of course her freedom papers, doctor.

1609
02:07:42,291 --> 02:07:44,452
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1610
02:07:45,653 --> 02:07:47,523
Right over there, on that little table.

1611
02:07:47,617 --> 02:07:49,017
Thank you.

1612
02:08:09,888 --> 02:08:11,288
Thank you.

1613
02:08:14,773 --> 02:08:16,593
Broomhilda Von Shaft…

1614
02:08:19,084 --> 02:08:21,302
consider yourself a free woman.

1615
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,320
Mister Candie…

1616
02:08:37,248 --> 02:08:40,753
Normally, I would say “auf wiedersehen”.

1617
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:45,673
But since what “auf wiedersehen”
actually means is “till I see you again”,

1618
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:49,703
and since I never wish
to see you again, to you sir,

1619
02:08:50,133 --> 02:08:52,735
I say good bye.

1620
02:08:56,983 --> 02:08:58,383
Let's go.

1621
02:08:59,723 --> 02:09:00,843
Com'on.

1622
02:09:02,858 --> 02:09:05,258
One more moment, Doctor!

1623
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:07,726
What?

1624
02:09:12,293 --> 02:09:14,470
It's a custom here in the South,

1625
02:09:14,996 --> 02:09:18,165
once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties…

1626
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,541
shake hands.

1627
02:09:21,277 --> 02:09:22,664
It implies good faith.

1628
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,593
– I'm not from the South.
– But you are…

1629
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,125
in my house doctor…

1630
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:31,316
so I'm afraid I must insist.

1631
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:34,788
Insist? On what?
That I shake your hand?

1632
02:09:34,805 --> 02:09:37,935
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist
in the opposite direction.

1633
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,453
You know what I think you are?

1634
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,640
What you think I am?
No I don't.

1635
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:47,657
I think you are a bad loser.

1636
02:09:47,831 --> 02:09:50,831
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1637
02:09:51,026 --> 02:09:52,539
Never the less…

1638
02:09:52,886 --> 02:09:55,781
here in Chickasaw County,
a deal ain't done

1639
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:58,734
until the two parties have shook hands.

1640
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:02,419
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit…

1641
02:10:03,341 --> 02:10:06,385
you don't shake my hand.

1642
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:10,664
If I don't shake your hand,

1643
02:10:10,859 --> 02:10:13,507
you're gonna throw away
twelve thousand dollars?

1644
02:10:13,688 --> 02:10:15,787
I don't think so.

1645
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:18,289
Mr. Butch,

1646
02:10:19,657 --> 02:10:23,662
if she tries to leave here before
this nigger lovin' German shakes my hand,

1647
02:10:24,432 --> 02:10:26,592
you cut her ass down.

1648
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:51,424
You really want me to shake your hand?

1649
02:10:52,951 --> 02:10:54,511
I insist.

1650
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:58,222
If you insist.

1651
02:11:16,453 --> 02:11:18,212
Aaah Calvin!

1652
02:11:19,108 --> 02:11:21,206
Caalvin!

1653
02:11:26,976 --> 02:11:29,432
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.

1654
02:11:41,843 --> 02:11:43,778
The nigger's going crazy, the hell-

1655
02:11:44,727 --> 02:11:47,396
Help, he's blowing everybody- Aaah!

1656
02:12:04,453 --> 02:12:06,575
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1657
02:12:10,728 --> 02:12:11,848
Get that fuckin'…

1658
02:12:12,476 --> 02:12:13,596
Get that fuckin'-

1659
02:12:16,567 --> 02:12:21,182
Damnit sonofabitch, what-
what did the fuckin'- goddammit!

1660
02:12:22,546 --> 02:12:23,666
What the-

1661
02:12:25,672 --> 02:12:27,039
Jeez, that's me!

1662
02:12:27,132 --> 02:12:28,857
You stupid sonofabitch!

1663
02:12:28,928 --> 02:12:30,328
Sorry Jessie!

1664
02:12:30,404 --> 02:12:34,995
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun!

1665
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:10,515
Ain't no nigger gonna-

1666
02:13:10,922 --> 02:13:14,169
Aah! God! Ah my God, aah!

1667
02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:16,138
Motherfucker!

1668
02:14:35,634 --> 02:14:37,454
Hold your fire!

1669
02:14:40,294 --> 02:14:42,114
Hold your fire!

1670
02:14:43,597 --> 02:14:45,697
Stop shooting, goddammit!

1671
02:14:54,284 --> 02:14:55,404
Django!

1672
02:14:56,285 --> 02:14:57,405
What?

1673
02:15:00,267 --> 02:15:02,087
We got your woman!

1674
02:15:03,273 --> 02:15:06,342
Billy Crash here ha' got
his pistol upside her head!

1675
02:15:06,841 --> 02:15:08,880
You don't stop all that cayyin' on,

1676
02:15:08,982 --> 02:15:11,518
he gon' blow her goddamn brains out.

1677
02:15:11,693 --> 02:15:13,582
And that ain't no threat, horse-boy!

1678
02:15:14,535 --> 02:15:15,907
That there is a promise.

1679
02:15:17,509 --> 02:15:18,629
Or, or…

1680
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:20,090
You can give up…

1681
02:15:20,546 --> 02:15:22,646
Throw y' gun out, uh?

1682
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,080
We won't kill Hildi.

1683
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,850
Horseshit!

1684
02:15:26,052 --> 02:15:28,776
Honest injun Django,
I swear 'fore God.

1685
02:15:30,177 --> 02:15:31,297
You give up…

1686
02:15:32,151 --> 02:15:34,422
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1687
02:15:36,306 --> 02:15:38,352
And I'm supposed to
believe your black ass?

1688
02:15:38,628 --> 02:15:41,858
Personal, I ain't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1689
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:44,965
I believe, if you don't give up
in the next ten seconds,

1690
02:15:44,979 --> 02:15:47,140
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!

1691
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:48,968
Believe that!

1692
02:15:53,184 --> 02:15:54,582
You give me up.

1693
02:15:54,824 --> 02:15:55,527
Six!

1694
02:15:55,551 --> 02:15:56,871
Just let me go!

1695
02:15:57,021 --> 02:15:57,769
Seven!

1696
02:15:57,797 --> 02:15:59,271
– They got too much.
– Django.

1697
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:00,195
Eight!

1698
02:16:00,524 --> 02:16:01,924
I love you.

1699
02:16:01,993 --> 02:16:03,113
Nine!

1700
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:03,989
Hold it!

1701
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:04,888
No!

1702
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:08,607
I give up.

1703
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,562
I can't hear you, nigger.

1704
02:16:12,469 --> 02:16:14,547
I said: I give up!

1705
02:18:14,968 --> 02:18:16,793
Cock a doodle doo, nigger.

1706
02:18:22,496 --> 02:18:24,775
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1707
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:27,940
I knew there was
something fishy 'bout y'all.

1708
02:18:29,356 --> 02:18:34,025
We found your “wanted” posters…
and book of figures in your saddle bags.

1709
02:18:35,762 --> 02:18:37,307
I gotta say…

1710
02:18:38,115 --> 02:18:40,706
I ain't never heard of no
black bounty hunter before.

1711
02:18:41,432 --> 02:18:44,742
A black boy paid to kill white men,
how d'you like that line of work?

1712
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:48,370
Prob'bly pretty good while it lasted, uh?

1713
02:18:57,783 --> 02:19:00,099
Time to say goodnight to them nuts, black.

1714
02:19:00,282 --> 02:19:01,365
On three…

1715
02:19:01,849 --> 02:19:02,948
One…

1716
02:19:03,788 --> 02:19:04,756
I got you.

1717
02:19:05,506 --> 02:19:06,692
Two…

1718
02:19:06,973 --> 02:19:08,892
Calm down nigger, keep calm.

1719
02:19:10,033 --> 02:19:11,153
Cap't?

1720
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,160
Miss Lara wants to see you.

1721
02:19:14,265 --> 02:19:17,173
That is somethin' to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1722
02:19:18,455 --> 02:19:21,922
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snippin' Django.

1723
02:19:23,079 --> 02:19:26,381
She gonna give 'em to the
LeQuint Dickey people.

1724
02:19:27,671 --> 02:19:30,231
Well she didn't waste
a minute tellin' me.

1725
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:39,197
How disappointing.

1726
02:20:01,815 --> 02:20:02,935
You'll leave.

1727
02:20:04,907 --> 02:20:06,027
These here is…

1728
02:20:06,453 --> 02:20:08,273
what you can take with you.

1729
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:14,854
Your black ass been all the
motherfuckers' in the Big House

1730
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:17,539
can talk about for the last few hours.

1731
02:20:18,446 --> 02:20:22,342
Seemed like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in their life,

1732
02:20:22,363 --> 02:20:24,803
was comin' up with all kinds
o'ways to kill your ass.

1733
02:20:25,014 --> 02:20:30,621
Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1734
02:20:30,697 --> 02:20:35,999
Now, that may seem like
a good idea, but truth is…

1735
02:20:37,669 --> 02:20:43,338
when you snip a nigger's nuts,
most of 'em bleed out, in, oh 'bout…

1736
02:20:43,512 --> 02:20:45,512
seven minutes, most of 'em…

1737
02:20:47,992 --> 02:20:49,419
Well, more n' most.

1738
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:51,739
Then I says…

1739
02:20:53,504 --> 02:20:55,340
Shitfire…

1740
02:20:55,980 --> 02:21:00,174
the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey,
got it worse then that.

1741
02:21:01,244 --> 02:21:04,069
And they're still sayin'
“Let's whip 'em to death”,

1742
02:21:04,145 --> 02:21:07,595
Throw 'em to the mandingos”,
“Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs”.

1743
02:21:07,831 --> 02:21:12,891
And I say, “What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time!

1744
02:21:13,048 --> 02:21:19,295
Hells bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that”.

1745
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:27,136
Low and behold, out of nowhere,
miss Lara come up with the bright idea

1746
02:21:28,078 --> 02:21:32,739
of givin' your ass to the LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company.

1747
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:38,519
And as a slave of the LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company,

1748
02:21:39,254 --> 02:21:42,783
hence forth, till the day you die,

1749
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,986
all day, ev'ryday,

1750
02:21:46,236 --> 02:21:48,843
you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,

1751
02:21:49,192 --> 02:21:53,272
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1752
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:58,680
Now when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1753
02:21:58,844 --> 02:22:01,599
give you a number, and a sledgehammer,

1754
02:22:02,021 --> 02:22:03,857
and say “get to work”.

1755
02:22:04,562 --> 02:22:07,112
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue,

1756
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,513
they's good at it too,
you won't bleed out.

1757
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:12,043
Ooh, they does that real good.

1758
02:22:13,502 --> 02:22:19,845
They gonna work you, all day,
ev'ry day, till your back give out.

1759
02:22:20,407 --> 02:22:22,896
Then they gonna hit you
in the head with your hammer,

1760
02:22:23,039 --> 02:22:25,388
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1761
02:22:25,881 --> 02:22:31,175
And that… will be the story
of you, Django.

1762
02:23:19,696 --> 02:23:21,516
Hey, white boy…

1763
02:23:22,982 --> 02:23:24,802
I said: hey, white boy!

1764
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,906
Shut up, black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

1765
02:23:27,938 --> 02:23:30,647
How'd you like to make
eleven thousand dollars?

1766
02:23:30,694 --> 02:23:31,980
Do what now?

1767
02:23:32,018 --> 02:23:34,766
I said, how d'you like to make
eleven thousand dollars?

1768
02:23:35,722 --> 02:23:37,821
Eleven thousand five hundred, actually.

1769
02:23:38,267 --> 02:23:40,235
What the fuck are you talking about?

1770
02:23:40,306 --> 02:23:42,522
Back there at that
plantation Candyland,

1771
02:23:42,576 --> 02:23:45,026
there was an eleven thousand five
hundred dollar fortune,

1772
02:23:45,148 --> 02:23:47,868
just sittin' there,
and y'all rode right past it.

1773
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:50,437
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1774
02:23:50,566 --> 02:23:53,446
I ain't sayin' that, nice thing
'bout this fortune it is.

1775
02:23:53,661 --> 02:23:56,104
It ain't illegal, you can't steal it,

1776
02:23:56,803 --> 02:23:58,230
ya gotta earn it, white boy.

1777
02:23:59,133 --> 02:24:01,305
You got something to say,
mate, you say it.

1778
02:24:01,357 --> 02:24:04,638
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune waiting for you back at Candyland,

1779
02:24:04,686 --> 02:24:07,136
is in the form of a wanted
dead or alive bounty

1780
02:24:07,153 --> 02:24:09,252
on Smitty Bacall, and the Bacall Gang.

1781
02:24:09,493 --> 02:24:11,352
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1782
02:24:11,393 --> 02:24:14,709
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1783
02:24:14,784 --> 02:24:16,315
the Bacall Gang.

1784
02:24:16,326 --> 02:24:19,733
There's a seven thousand dollar
wanted dead or alive bounty on him,

1785
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:23,071
one thousand five hundred dollars
for each of his three accomplices.

1786
02:24:23,274 --> 02:24:24,461
Dandy Michaels,

1787
02:24:25,227 --> 02:24:26,347
Gerald Nash,

1788
02:24:26,618 --> 02:24:28,858
Crazy Craig Koons.

1789
02:24:29,686 --> 02:24:32,465
Now all four o'them gentlemen,
they're back there at Candyland,

1790
02:24:32,535 --> 02:24:34,650
laughin' their ass off.
You know why?

1791
02:24:34,876 --> 02:24:37,076
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1792
02:24:37,342 --> 02:24:39,011
But it ain't got to be that way.

1793
02:24:39,085 --> 02:24:42,004
You and your mates, ya'll ride there
and y'all go get that money.

1794
02:24:42,059 --> 02:24:43,856
What these jokers do again?

1795
02:24:43,903 --> 02:24:46,721
These sonofabitches, they-
they killed innocent people.

1796
02:24:47,362 --> 02:24:49,906
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people!

1797
02:24:51,736 --> 02:24:54,719
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket if you let me get it.

1798
02:24:54,767 --> 02:24:56,167
Get it out.

1799
02:24:58,015 --> 02:25:03,155
Wanted dead or alive… Smitty Bacall
and the Smitty Bacall gang…

1800
02:25:03,156 --> 02:25:04,908
– But you're a slave!
– .. for murder…

1801
02:25:04,909 --> 02:25:07,329
– I ain't no goddamn slave!
– .. in a stagecoach robbery.

1802
02:25:07,333 --> 02:25:08,821
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1803
02:25:08,976 --> 02:25:11,458
<i>– 7000 dollars for Smitty Bacall…
– That's a shit load!</i>

1804
02:25:11,638 --> 02:25:13,169
I'm a bounty hunter.

1805
02:25:15,137 --> 02:25:19,593
Yesterday, as a free man,
I rode into Candyland, on a horse,

1806
02:25:19,627 --> 02:25:23,549
with my German white
partner, Dr. King Schultz.

1807
02:25:24,222 --> 02:25:28,727
We tracked the Bacall gang all the way
from Texas, to Chickasaw County.

1808
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:31,842
We finally found their ass
laying low at Candyland.

1809
02:25:32,102 --> 02:25:35,271
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1810
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:38,732
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot.

1811
02:25:39,207 --> 02:25:43,157
Then ev'rybody there decided
to blame me, so here I am.

1812
02:25:45,447 --> 02:25:47,390
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest,

1813
02:25:47,539 --> 02:25:50,200
and all'ya know I ain't
supposed to be on this trip.

1814
02:25:50,616 --> 02:25:53,666
But them four men are still back there,
they're still wanted,

1815
02:25:54,062 --> 02:25:56,236
and that eleven thousand
five hundred is up for grabs,

1816
02:25:56,245 --> 02:25:59,702
and the last thing they'd expect
is y'all ridin' back there and gittin' it.

1817
02:25:59,713 --> 02:26:01,533
What's the deal?

1818
02:26:02,055 --> 02:26:05,974
You tell us who they are
and we… turn you lose?

1819
02:26:06,272 --> 02:26:08,472
I ain't tellin' who they are.

1820
02:26:08,504 --> 02:26:11,738
Look, you give me a pistol,
one o'them horses,

1821
02:26:11,993 --> 02:26:15,157
and five hundred dollars of that
eleven thousand five hundred,

1822
02:26:15,242 --> 02:26:16,652
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1823
02:26:16,838 --> 02:26:18,173
<i>This a real handbill.</i>

1824
02:26:18,267 --> 02:26:22,126
Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill doesn't
mean that other bunch o'malarky is.

1825
02:26:22,226 --> 02:26:28,239
Now why would a slave have a wanted
dead or alive handbill in his pocket?

1826
02:26:32,846 --> 02:26:36,046
Ain't that black ride into
Candyland yesterday?

1827
02:26:42,014 --> 02:26:43,097
Alright…

1828
02:26:43,853 --> 02:26:45,878
I'm gonna ask you again…

1829
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,613
I want you to remember I don't like liars.

1830
02:26:50,534 --> 02:26:55,930
Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in
with a white man on horse yesterday?

1831
02:26:56,415 --> 02:26:57,535
Yeah.

1832
02:26:58,531 --> 02:27:00,656
They walked us from
the Greenville Auction and

1833
02:27:00,657 --> 02:27:02,731
he rode in on a horse with a white man.

1834
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:05,836
And this white man…

1835
02:27:06,039 --> 02:27:07,667
was the black his slave?

1836
02:27:08,081 --> 02:27:09,635
He weren't no slave.

1837
02:27:09,682 --> 02:27:11,775
You you fuckin' sure about that?

1838
02:27:11,821 --> 02:27:13,221
Damn sure.

1839
02:27:17,504 --> 02:27:19,291
What happened over at Candyland?

1840
02:27:19,354 --> 02:27:20,408
Bunch of shootin'…

1841
02:27:21,033 --> 02:27:22,538
massa' got shot.

1842
02:27:23,018 --> 02:27:24,674
– Who shot 'em?
– The German.

1843
02:27:25,164 --> 02:27:26,375
Why did he do that?

1844
02:27:26,911 --> 02:27:30,403
The nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers, but they weren't.

1845
02:27:30,724 --> 02:27:32,409
Well, what was they?

1846
02:27:32,586 --> 02:27:34,284
Bounty hunters.

1847
02:27:35,098 --> 02:27:37,758
Fuck me Roy, I mean this-
this could be big, mate!

1848
02:27:39,174 --> 02:27:40,499
Well, smoke…

1849
02:27:41,281 --> 02:27:42,679
you gotta deal.

1850
02:27:43,941 --> 02:27:45,374
I got one more condition.

1851
02:27:45,986 --> 02:27:46,923
What is that?

1852
02:27:47,007 --> 02:27:49,864
When we get there…
when the time come…

1853
02:27:52,184 --> 02:27:54,041
you let me help you kill 'em.

1854
02:27:55,331 --> 02:27:56,977
Hey! You're a funny bugger!

1855
02:27:57,216 --> 02:27:59,192
– Get him loose.
– Yeah, yeah.

1856
02:27:59,461 --> 02:28:01,482
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1857
02:28:01,607 --> 02:28:03,263
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1858
02:28:05,577 --> 02:28:07,887
– Oi! Eh, you alright for a black fella?!
– Oh yeah!

1859
02:28:13,774 --> 02:28:16,224
There ya go… There ya go, mate.

1860
02:28:17,267 --> 02:28:19,667
For you, we'll give you
that pack horse over here.

1861
02:28:19,923 --> 02:28:21,860
What's them saddle bags got in?

1862
02:28:22,131 --> 02:28:23,135
Dynamite.

1863
02:28:23,136 --> 02:28:26,216
I ain't ridin' no horse with no
goddamn dynamite on his back.

1864
02:28:26,247 --> 02:28:27,471
I can understand that.

1865
02:28:28,284 --> 02:28:30,949
Frankie, why don't ya
take 'em sticks off that horse,

1866
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:33,867
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1867
02:28:35,118 --> 02:28:38,256
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with!

1868
02:28:48,544 --> 02:28:51,393
Hey Floyd, you got that rifle
on the wagon, don't you?

1869
02:28:51,424 --> 02:28:52,338
Yeah, alright.

1870
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:54,510
Why don't you give 'em
your gun and gun belt?

1871
02:28:56,789 --> 02:28:59,325
Now, don't drop the
fucking thing, alright?

1872
02:28:59,873 --> 02:29:02,677
I just had the sights fixed,
and they're perfect.

1873
02:29:02,964 --> 02:29:04,558
Uh, that's good to know.

1874
02:30:36,672 --> 02:30:38,648
Throw me up that dynamite.

1875
02:32:08,842 --> 02:32:10,233
– Jake!
– Yeah?

1876
02:32:10,258 --> 02:32:13,826
Get out there n' see what's goin'on
with them goddamn dogs!

1877
02:32:18,281 --> 02:32:20,138
For D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

1878
02:33:50,262 --> 02:33:51,916
Auf wiedersehen.

1879
02:34:52,137 --> 02:34:53,537
It's me, baby.

1880
02:35:41,742 --> 02:35:44,641
