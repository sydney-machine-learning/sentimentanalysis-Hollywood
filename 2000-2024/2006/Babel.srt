1
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,496
It's almost new.

2
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,006
Three hundred cartridges.

3
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,840
The guy who
gave it to me said...

4
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:03,355
you can hit
as far as three kilometers.

5
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,991
How much are you asking
for all of this?

6
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,026
One thousand dirhams.

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,061
One thousand dirhams?

8
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,367
I'll give you five hundred.

9
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,239
And a goat.

10
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:42,693
With this rifle, your sons
will kill plenty of jackals.

11
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,363
Here, let one of your boys try.

12
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,832
Let Yussef shoot.

13
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,703
Dad, I want to shoot first.

14
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,983
This is the safety.
Push it in when you're ready.

15
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,822
If he doesn't hit the jackals,
at least he'll scare the shit out of them.

16
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,391
Your turn Yussef.

17
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,669
He shoots better than you.

18
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,250
Good luck,
have a good day.

19
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,343
God bless you.

20
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,424
Kill at least three jackals.

21
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:50,786
Make sure no one
sees you with the rifle...

22
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,765
if you see someone coming, hide it.

23
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you doing?

24
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,034
I told you,
don't spy on her.

25
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,703
What do you care?

26
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,474
Move it.

27
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,565
Five to two.

28
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,801
There's a jackal.

29
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:09,875
Where?

30
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,699
Over there.

31
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,915
What are you doing,
you idiot?

32
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,535
Zohra doesn't mind.

33
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,868
She doesn't, but I do.

34
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,680
This is between her and me.

35
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:54,042
You're both pigs.
Next time I'm going to tell Dad.

36
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,045
Stay out of this.

37
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,682
If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it.

38
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,446
What are you doing?

39
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,688
Hassan said this bullet
could reach three kilometers.

40
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,193
That rock didn't move.

41
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,695
You don't know how to shoot.
Give me the rifle.

42
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,162
See.

43
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,004
Yeah, but that's not
three kilometers.

44
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,647
I bet the bullet
can't hit that far.

45
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,493
These bullets are lame.

46
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,026
You're not aiming right.

47
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,804
What'll you give me
if I hit that car?

48
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,339
I'll shoot.

49
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,483
You see? Nothing.

50
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,879
Let me shoot.

51
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,779
Shoot at it.

52
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,899
See... nothing.

53
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,433
You're right, they're useless.

54
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,666
Where are these kids?

55
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,460
Where are you?

56
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,539
I'm coming to get you...

57
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,938
Base!

58
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,768
You win.

59
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,874
<i>- Yes?
- Amelia?</i>

60
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,341
Yes, sir.

61
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,476
<i>Hi. How's everything?</i>

62
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,553
Everything is okay, sir.

63
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,650
Mrs. Rachel told me.
I am very sorry, sir.

64
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,583
How's Mrs. Susan?

65
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,696
<i>She's better now.
They're going to have to operate, but...</i>

66
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,522
<i>Look, Rachel's flying in tonight.</i>

67
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,727
<i>She's gonna find someone to
take care of the kids so you can go.</i>

68
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,328
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

69
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,100
<i>So, look after them, okay?
Don't tell them anything.</i>

70
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,700
No, no, no. Don't worry, sir.
Don't worry. Okay.

71
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,837
<i>- Put Mike on, please.
- Yes, sir.</i>

72
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,411
Mike? Your dad is calling.

73
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,714
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?</i>

74
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,691
Good. Dad, guess what? Today
they brought hermit crabs to class.

75
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,920
<i>Oh, really?</i>

76
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,293
I held one in my hands. It bit me.
It really didn't bleed, but...

77
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,262
Dad? Are you okay?

78
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,302
<i>I'm okay. Everything's fine.</i>

79
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,203
Mariana wanted to take one home.
But the teacher didn't let her. She was...

80
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,139
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to go to sleep.

81
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,177
Mike. Mike.

82
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,575
Did you brush your teeth?

83
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,653
Sleep with angels, my darling.

84
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,692
Sleep well, sweetie.

85
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,437
Amelia?

86
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,808
Amelia?

87
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,943
Could you leave the light on?

88
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,814
You are already sharing a room...

89
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,116
didn't we agree
to sleep with the lights off?

90
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,520
But I'm scared.

91
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,649
There's nothing to be scared of.

92
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,786
But I'm scared that what happened
to Sam is going to happen to me.

93
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:10,229
No, that won't happen to you.

94
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,362
Sam died while he was sleeping.

95
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,201
No, baby, no, no.

96
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:20,034
That only happens to some babies
when they're really, really little.

97
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,941
Your brother is already
high in heaven, baby.

98
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:29,078
I'll sit here with you.
But you can't talk anymore, okay?

99
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,154
Go to sleep.

100
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,420
But today is my son's wedding, sir.

101
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,286
<i>Cancel your son's wedding.
I'll pay for another one,</i>

102
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,589
<i>I'll pay for a better one.
I need you to do this, Amelia.</i>

103
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,686
Everything is ready, sir.

104
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,126
Can't anyone come to take care
of the kids? It's just one day, sir.

105
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,429
<i>How do you expect me to find someone
from here?</i>

106
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,528
<i>Susan's still recovering, and Rachel
can't make it to take care of the kids.</i>

107
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,368
<i>Can't do it. Hold on.</i>

108
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,771
<i>We're really counting on you, Amelia.
I'm sorry, but you have to do this.</i>

109
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,472
<i>- But...
- Goodbye.</i>

110
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,822
How can I be
in two places at once?

111
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,827
I'm just asking you
to take them for today.

112
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,428
I can't, the mister is still home.

113
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,091
And they aren't going out?

114
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,170
No, I don't think so.

115
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,839
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

116
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,711
I can't Amelia.

117
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,542
Please, it's my son's wedding.

118
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,713
Just for the day, Lucia.
I'll be back for them tonight.

119
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,051
And what do I say to Mrs. Catherine?

120
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,821
I don't know.
Tell her they're your nephews.

121
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,987
Right, because they look
so much like me...

122
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,065
with my American looking face!

123
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,158
Are we going to see your house?

124
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,136
Yes. You are going to see my house.

125
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,670
Is it far?

126
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,734
No, no.

127
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,550
What's up?

128
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,683
Hi Auntie.

129
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,760
Great to see you, Santiago.

130
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,658
Mike. Debbie.

131
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,922
Hello!

132
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,000
Hello, hello.

133
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,830
They're really shy.

134
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,800
What? These kids
are coming with us?

135
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,100
I couldn't find anyone to watch them.

136
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,036
Their parents won't return tonight.

137
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,043
Why bring them?
They'll drive you crazy.

138
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,340
Don't worry,
they're very good kids.

139
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,682
Don't you want to
leave them with somebody?

140
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,149
I know a girl who
can take care of them.

141
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,050
Are you crazy?
I have to take them with me.

142
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,884
I can't leave them
with just anybody.

143
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,883
Are you sure, Auntie?

144
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,708
You want to order?

145
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,045
Yeah, I'll have the chicken couscous
and a Coke.

146
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,988
What do you have
that doesn't have fat in it?

147
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,386
Everything is delicious.

148
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,626
I'll have the fried eggplant
and a Diet Coke.

149
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,491
Sorry, we don't have Diet Coke.

150
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,962
- Then a regular Coke.
- Two Cokes.

151
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,850
Richard, why did we come here?

152
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,319
What do you mean, why?

153
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,859
Really. Why are we here?

154
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,457
To be alone.

155
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,169
"Alone."

156
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,148
- Throw out the ice.
- The Coke's hot.

157
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,747
Yeah, but you don't know
what kind of water is in there.

158
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,502
Jesus Christ. Why can't you just relax?
Why are you so stressed?

159
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,237
You are the reason I'm stressed.
You're the reason why I can't relax.

160
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,177
You could if you tried.

161
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,886
You don't think I tried?

162
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,256
You're never gonna forgive me,
are you?

163
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,373
You know what I'm talking about.

164
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,481
Hey. I'm not gonna argue.

165
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,151
Okay.

166
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,661
You just let me know
when you're ready to argue.

167
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,666
If you're not gonna run away again.

168
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,782
- Honey? What happened?
- I'm okay.

169
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,519
Honey, what happened?
What happened?

170
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,255
You're bleeding, you're bleeding.

171
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,697
- Oh, my God!
- She's been shot!

172
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,232
Jesus. What happened?

173
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,962
You're bleeding. Oh, my God!

174
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,233
Stop the bus!

175
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,609
- What happened?
- Stop the bus!

176
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,077
The ball was out.

177
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,048
That was out.

178
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,924
No, it was good.

179
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,126
That was out.

180
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,488
I'm deaf, not blind.

181
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,925
You're out.

182
00:20:55,087 --> 00:21:00,150
You shouldn't have lost your temper.
We lost the game.

183
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,992
It wasn't my fault,
it was the ref.

184
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,700
If you hadn't been thrown out,
we would've won the game.

185
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,429
Why are you
in a bad mood?

186
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,573
She's always in a bad mood
because nobody's fucked her yet.

187
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,580
I'm gonna fuck your dad
to get rid of my mood.

188
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,750
I'll see you at the J-Pop.

189
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,543
What do you want to eat?

190
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,478
I said I'd meet my friends
from the team at J-Pop.

191
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,009
Didn't you tell me
we would have lunch together?

192
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,815
Dad, I told you I was
going to eat with them.

193
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,785
You never pay attention to me.

194
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,032
My mother always
paid attention to me.

195
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,805
Why do you want to fight?

196
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:40,816
I miss your mother too.

197
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,366
I'm doing the best I can.

198
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,121
Don't forget
the dentist at three.

199
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,626
Take care.

200
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,958
Do you have a table?

201
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,641
Why all the way in the corner?

202
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,781
Isn't the view nice?

203
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,901
Do you like him?

204
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,732
Hello.

205
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,004
Hello.

206
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,382
Can I play with you?

207
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,012
Or you can
have a drink with us?

208
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,556
Tell him to speak slowly.

209
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,996
Can you say that
a little slower?

210
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,107
You assholes,
how embarrassing.

211
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,032
What's the matter?

212
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,969
They look at us
like we're monsters.

213
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,804
Oh, come off it.

214
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,087
What are you doing?

215
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,555
Now they're going to meet
the real hairy monster.

216
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,418
<i>Don't forget your appointment
with the dentist. Papa.</i>

217
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,554
I have to go.

218
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,421
I'll see you at your place, then.

219
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,399
What are you doing here?

220
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,261
Something we ate
gave us a stomach ache.

221
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,734
The goats will die
if they don't eat.

222
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,866
Wash your face
and take them out again.

223
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,409
My stomach hurts.

224
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,078
There are other
chores to do then.

225
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,615
Move it. Let's go.

226
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,979
God bless. Bye, bye.

227
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,919
Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow.

228
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,582
Tell your mother
to prepare dinner.

229
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,412
Did you kill any jackals?

230
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,875
We shot at them,
but didn't hit any.

231
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,616
You have to kill them.
If not, they're going to eat all the goats.

232
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,682
Why did you come home late?

233
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,955
They closed the road,
we took the long way.

234
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,960
Apparently some terrorists
killed an American tourist.

235
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,831
An American?

236
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,696
Yes, the terrorists attacked
a tour bus on the road.

237
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,370
No, there aren't any terrorists here.

238
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,498
You never know.

239
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,146
How do you know
the American died?

240
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,654
That's what they were saying.
The police are looking for the culprits.

241
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,076
You see how easy it is
to get into paradise?

242
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,412
Is this Mexico?

243
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,246
Yes, this is Mexico.

244
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,582
My mom told me
that Mexico is really dangerous.

245
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,554
Yeah... it's full of Mexicans.

246
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,922
Don't talk like that.

247
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,653
It's not true.

248
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,201
I mean, yeah, it's full of Mexicans, but...

249
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,966
How wonderful, you made it.

250
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,700
You decided to bring them?

251
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,165
Hey, what's up?

252
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,906
Oh, son, look how handsome.

253
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,506
You look like Julio Preciado.

254
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,573
Forget Julio Preciado,
he looks like Luis Miguel.

255
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,777
Debbie. Mike.

256
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,914
These are the kids
I take care of.

257
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,515
Say hi to Luis.

258
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,959
Lucio, come here.

259
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,327
This is Mike and Debbie.

260
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,957
He's called Lucio.
He's gonna take care of you, okay?

261
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,263
Take them to play.

262
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,542
Mom, I don't know how you did it,
but it zipped up perfectly.

263
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,879
And it's been 15 years
since I wore this dress.

264
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,183
You haven't changed a bit, Ma.

265
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,620
Working dear, hard work...
that's what keeps you young.

266
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,124
What are you guys laughing about?

267
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,922
Nothing Ma, nothing.

268
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,769
I'll give a buck to the first
who catches a chicken.

269
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,743
Careful with the 'huevos.'

270
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,588
Very good, Debbie got one.

271
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,027
Debbie's the winner.

272
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,295
Okay, now we need another five.

273
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,268
So we have five chickens here.

274
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,606
Okay, now who's going to help me?

275
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,269
You? Okay, come.

276
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,305
Hold it tight, like this.

277
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,211
Grab it right.

278
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:26,052
Everyone back up...
give me some room.

279
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,731
Someone, help!

280
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,854
Is anybody a doctor? Please, a doctor!

281
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,599
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- It's far away. About four hours.

282
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,693
- Is there anything closer?
- There's a clinic.

283
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:17,001
But on the south. In the bus
it will take us an hour and a half.

284
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,805
- Away from Ouarzazate?
- Yes. It's the closest thing we've got.

285
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,574
Get down!

286
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,946
- Put that there.
- Okay.

287
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,221
Stop! Stop!

288
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,119
We need your help.
My wife's been injured.

289
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,991
I need your help. Help. Hospital.

290
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,929
Help, come here.
Tell him we need his help!

291
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,630
No, wait! Wait! Wait!
Stop him! Stop him!

292
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,183
Ouarzazate isn't this way.
They're going to start shooting at us.

293
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,518
- Turn the bus around, Anwar!
- It hurts.

294
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,184
- Turn back. Turn the bus around!
- It really hurts.

295
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,724
We got to get somewhere closer.
Is there anywhere else we can take her?

296
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,299
We can take her to my town.

297
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,166
It's near here, and there is a doctor.
We can call Erfoud for an ambulance.

298
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,406
Okay. Okay.

299
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,577
Watch her shoulder!
Watch her shoulder!

300
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,739
Okay. Okay.

301
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,380
- Turn this way.
- No, no.

302
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,150
Through the next door. Come on.

303
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,971
We got to call an ambulance.
I need to call my embassy.

304
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,475
Okay. If you have the number
of your embassy, I can go call.

305
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,704
Where are you going?

306
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,746
I'll make the call.
Okay, I got to go make a call.

307
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,839
- Please don't leave me here alone.
- You're going to be all right.

308
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,939
- Can she help?
- Yeah, yeah.

309
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,484
Where are you going? Please
don't leave me here alone.

310
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,678
- Can she help?
- Yes.

311
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,119
Listen, listen. It's gonna be all right.
I'm just gonna go make a call.

312
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,124
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Tell her
she has to keep pressure right here.

313
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,818
She cannot let go.
Does she understand?

314
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,916
Yes.

315
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,962
I'm just gonna make sure help's
on the way. I'm coming right back.

316
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,191
- Please don't leave me.
- Does she understand?

317
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,062
- I'll be right back.
- Richard, no, don't leave me here.

318
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,001
- I'll be right back.
- Richard, don't. Richard!

319
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,971
I'll be back, sweetheart.
Just gonna make the call.

320
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,572
- How's your wife?
- It's bad. I can't stop the bleeding.

321
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,078
- Get her out of there and let's go.
- Where? Where do I take her?

322
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,014
In Egypt in a town like this
they slit 30 German tourists' throats.

323
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,448
- They might do the same to us.
- No, sir, not here.

324
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,713
What do you know? We've got to get
out of here as soon as possible.

325
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,810
It's unbearably hot.

326
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,186
- We have to get back for our children.
- Look, you can't leave us here.

327
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,020
- What is the point in our staying?
- In case we need the bus!

328
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,115
He can drop us off
and come back for you.

329
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,319
- No.
- I'll stay with you if you need me.

330
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,021
Please just wait. Let me figure this out.

331
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,724
We're not gonna risk our lives, so hurry.

332
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,277
I need your phone.
I will pay.

333
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,397
Rachel? Rachel? It's Richard. Listen.

334
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,442
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

335
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,671
We're still... Listen, listen.
There's been an accident.

336
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,375
Your sister's been shot.
She's been shot.

337
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,975
I don't know. I don't know.

338
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,644
<i>- She's hit in the neck.
- Oh, my God!</i>

339
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,154
Listen, listen, I need you
to call the embassy

340
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,387
and tell them what happened.
And call Mark, okay? Call Mark.

341
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,262
<i>Where are you?</i>

342
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,895
Where are we?

343
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,232
Tazarine. Three hours
southwest of Erfoud.

344
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,431
Tazarine. T-A-Z-A-R-I-N-E.

345
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,065
Three hours southwest of Erfoud.

346
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,936
It's in the desert. It's a village.

347
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,207
<i>- How are we supposed to find you?
- Listen, listen, listen!</i>

348
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,474
<i>- This is urgent, okay?
- Okay.</i>

349
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,176
Call the embassy. They will help us.
And call James!

350
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,556
This is the doctor.

351
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,144
Easy.

352
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,493
Easy, easy. Easy! Easy!

353
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,964
I can't, I can't.

354
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,836
Tell him, easy.

355
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,963
The bullet didn't
touch her spine.

356
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:00,973
If she stays like this,
she will bleed to death.

357
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,102
What did he say?

358
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,702
He says

359
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,743
she will be fine.

360
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,840
Don't you fucking lie to me.
You tell me what he said.

361
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,783
Tell me what he said!

362
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,322
Hospital. Hospital.

363
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,721
I know, hospital! What can you do?

364
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,588
Is there anything
we can do?

365
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,128
I have to stitch up the wound
to stop the bleeding.

366
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,629
He says he need to sew up the wounds.

367
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,290
What did he say?

368
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,997
He said you need some stitches, honey.

369
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,666
Stitches? What do you mean, stitches?

370
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,006
- What kind of doctor is he?
- He's a veterinarian. But he is good.

371
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,637
And tell him
her clavicle is broken.

372
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:42,007
He says she has a broken bone
and he has to put a splint on it.

373
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,816
If he doesn't sew up her wound,
she might bleed to death.

374
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,754
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Richard.

375
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,116
No, no, no, Richard.

376
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,321
We have to
hold her down.

377
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,888
- Richard. Richard. No, no, no, no.
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

378
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,199
- Richard, don't let him.
- Honey, we have to do this.

379
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,873
It's still bleeding. We got to stop
the bleeding. You gotta do this.

380
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,504
- We have to do this.
- No, no, don't let him.

381
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,741
- Listen to me.
- No, no, no, please.

382
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,977
No, no, no, no. Richard, don't.

383
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,314
- No!
- You got to be still.

384
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,516
- Richard, don't let him! No.
- You got to be still.

385
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,260
Be strong, be strong.

386
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,316
Here are the sterilized drill bits.

387
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,322
You have cavities
in two molars.

388
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:25,582
What are you doing?

389
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,024
What's wrong with you?

390
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,169
Get out.

391
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,283
Get out right now.

392
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,495
Yes, I'll let him know.

393
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,193
That's Mr. Wataya's daughter.

394
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,066
Thank you.

395
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,438
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

396
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,876
She's deaf-mute...

397
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:02,883
Face her when you speak
so she can read your lips.

398
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,054
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

399
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:16,494
We are Yoshjo Hamano and Kenji
Mamiya of the Metropolitan Police.

400
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,095
We would like
to see your father.

401
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:40,451
No, it's nothing bad.
We just want to talk to him.

402
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,918
Do you know
where he is?

403
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:49,097
Please tell him to call.

404
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,100
Don't be scared.
We just want to talk to him.

405
00:47:58,809 --> 00:47:59,833
Thank you.

406
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,689
<i>Chieko, I waited for you.
I have a meeting so I'll be back late.</i>

407
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,224
<i>I left you a bento box. Papa.</i>

408
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:26,025
<i>I'm on my way to your place.</i>

409
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,634
Where are you?

410
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,332
Hurry up!

411
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,460
<i>Moroccan officials
are investigating suspects...</i>

412
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,227
<i>in the shooting of
an American tourist.</i>

413
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:02,135
<i>Officials said the shooting
took place...</i>

414
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,505
Are you ready?

415
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,344
Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.

416
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,785
The cops came again?

417
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,894
Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months.
But these were different cops.

418
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,192
Did they come to ask
about your mother's death?

419
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,527
No, but they're probably going
to ask my dad about the same things.

420
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,502
They're just not convinced,
are they?

421
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,742
Believe it or not,
I liked one of the cops.

422
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,473
Idiot.

423
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,053
Did you put on some panties?

424
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,909
Are you sure
it was here?

425
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,819
An American stopped me.

426
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:03,255
I was scared.
He was covered in blood.

427
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,192
Where was the bus stopped?

428
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,422
Over there.

429
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,563
<i>Captain Alarid... Captain Alarid.</i>

430
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,857
<i>I found cartridges.</i>

431
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,043
We found four.
Here's one.

432
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,279
Did you search all over?

433
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:32,815
Yes, the whole mountain.

434
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,503
They're from around here.

435
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,837
Find out who has
a .270 caliber rifle.

436
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,198
Hassan Ibrahim?

437
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,673
- Yes.
- Drop your weapon.

438
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,800
I don't have a weapon.

439
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:28,900
Drop it now.

440
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,104
I told you to drop
your weapon.

441
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,305
This is just my knife.

442
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,449
Get on the ground.

443
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,539
What did we do?

444
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,982
Get down on the ground...
face down.

445
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:39,680
Don't look at me.

446
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,087
What did we do?

447
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,894
Take these skins to Najib,
see if he wants to buy them.

448
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,912
Why did you shoot at the bus?

449
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,987
I didn't shoot at anyone.

450
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,386
Then who?

451
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,364
It wasn't me.

452
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,505
That was your rifle.

453
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,481
I sold it yesterday.

454
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,882
Who did you sell it to?

455
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,072
Do you know where
Abdullah Adboum lives?

456
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,875
Yes.

457
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,384
You have to go over those mountains.

458
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,752
Who lives
in this area?

459
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,195
We live here with our mother.
Abdullah lives on the other side.

460
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:38,101
If you're lying, I'm going to
come back and cut your balls off.

461
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,472
You can come back
anytime you like.

462
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,577
Don't walk
between the graves.

463
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,835
Papa... Papa...

464
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:16,969
What happened?

465
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,206
The police...
they're looking for you.

466
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,510
Me? Why?

467
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,150
No, not for you...
they're looking for us.

468
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,617
Looking for you?
Why?

469
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,151
Because of the tourist.

470
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,715
What tourist?

471
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,621
The American...
Yussef killed her.

472
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:31,852
Liar, we both did.

473
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,355
What are you saying?

474
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,394
Yussef started shooting
at the cars...

475
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,232
because Hassan said
that the bullet could go far.

476
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,165
Liar, you started shooting at the cars.

477
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,326
But you killed her.

478
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,802
What are you saying?

479
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,738
Yussef killed the American
and he spies on Zohra naked...

480
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,638
and Zohra lets him watch her.

481
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,136
That's garbage.

482
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,743
It's not garbage.
She's a street girl and he spies on her.

483
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,516
Time to drink!

484
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:33,312
This song is dedicated
from Luis to Patricia...

485
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,391
the most beautiful bride
in the world.

486
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:14,062
I think Aunt Amelia has to dance.

487
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,239
Amelia, can I have this dance?

488
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,413
I don't think your wife
would like that.

489
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:13,251
Ohh, she passed away 10 years ago.
Come on Amelia.

490
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:03,317
Let's go dance... You have
something white on your face.

491
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,656
Don't get excited,
it's only cake.

492
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:22,405
<i>Today, near Tazarine,
there was an incident.</i>

493
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,275
<i>An American was shot.</i>

494
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:29,249
<i>Authorities say it
could have been a robbery.</i>

495
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,118
<i>But, the American government was
quick to suggest a terrorist link.</i>

496
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,383
<i>Minister Hassan Hazal
has said...</i>

497
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,962
<i>that terrorist cells have been
eradicated in our country...</i>

498
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,294
<i>and one act
of vulgar banditry...</i>

499
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:48,268
<i>followed by superficial evaluations
the U.S. places on it...</i>

500
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,669
<i>cannot ruin our image
or the economy.</i>

501
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,772
I want to call the kids.

502
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,475
Richard, I want to talk to the kids.

503
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,143
We can't move you right now.

504
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,086
- We'll call them later.
- I want to talk to the kids.

505
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:10,286
I got to talk to them.

506
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,907
I got to talk to the kids.

507
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,961
You have to turn on the
air-conditioning, my husband is ill.

508
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,128
No air-conditioning,
no gasoline near. I'm sorry.

509
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:06,174
Please, it's too hot.
We can get dehydrated.

510
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:07,242
What did he say?

511
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,707
He says we can't turn on
the air-conditioning

512
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,676
because it uses the gas.

513
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,815
Oh, fuck that. Come on.

514
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,415
Fuck you.

515
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,289
Tom, where are you going?

516
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,191
Get back. Wait there. Get back.

517
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,068
- Look, we're leaving.
- You're not leaving us.

518
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,503
There's old people here.
The heat is really getting...

519
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:38,665
Wait for the ambulance,
and then you can leave.

520
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,207
There's a man in the bus
who almost fainted,

521
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,777
and there's a woman who needs to
get back in time to take her medication.

522
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,347
- We can't leave him here.
- Well, let him come, then.

523
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,143
His wife's in no condition to travel.

524
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,979
There's people in no condition
to be kept waiting.

525
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,211
Can't you see that?

526
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,652
Please wait. The ambulance
is gonna be here any minute, right?

527
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,383
It's gonna be here any minute.

528
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,016
So I'm asking you all to please wait.

529
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,560
Thirty minutes.
We're giving you thirty minutes.

530
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,273
Who are they?

531
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,642
My cousins.

532
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:51,145
Is he deaf-mute
like us?

533
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:53,307
No, but he understands some.

534
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,322
What is your name?

535
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:12,068
Chieko.

536
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,734
My name's Haruki.

537
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,917
It's whisky.

538
01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:53,308
Do the cops come around here?

539
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:56,048
Sometimes.

540
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:33,244
You smell good.

541
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,147
Welcome home... may I help you?

542
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,231
Are you sure
you want him to come now?

543
01:15:06,887 --> 01:15:09,583
Is this Detective Mamiya?

544
01:15:10,925 --> 01:15:15,191
The deaf-mute girl you met this
afternoon asked me to call.

545
01:15:15,296 --> 01:15:17,457
Yes, her.

546
01:15:17,564 --> 01:15:23,901
She says she needs to talk to you,
alone... about her father.

547
01:15:25,873 --> 01:15:27,205
Why did you do this?

548
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,975
Why did you do this?

549
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:34,075
Answer me, damn it!

550
01:15:35,884 --> 01:15:37,681
We were testing the rifle.

551
01:15:39,087 --> 01:15:40,850
Are you idiots?

552
01:15:41,256 --> 01:15:43,747
You killed a woman.

553
01:15:44,993 --> 01:15:46,358
And you...

554
01:15:47,162 --> 01:15:49,460
You got naked
so your brother could watch?

555
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:54,526
Zohra got naked lots of times
so Yussef could watch her.

556
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,237
Is it true or not?

557
01:16:00,543 --> 01:16:02,033
Is it true or not?

558
01:16:17,527 --> 01:16:19,552
Why did you do this to us?

559
01:16:21,565 --> 01:16:23,089
Where's the rifle?

560
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:26,160
Where's the rifle?

561
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:29,063
I told you,
a hunter gave it to me.

562
01:16:29,706 --> 01:16:30,730
What hunter?

563
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:39,245
A Japanese hunter...
gave it to me.

564
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:43,814
I've got a picture.
She can get it.

565
01:16:44,288 --> 01:16:45,380
Go get it.

566
01:17:09,782 --> 01:17:14,116
He's holding the rifle
he gave me.

567
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:41,479
We're going to Najib's house.

568
01:17:41,614 --> 01:17:44,674
If the cops come,
tell them we went south.

569
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,738
This Abdullah doesn't live
in the area you told us.

570
01:18:05,873 --> 01:18:06,862
Are you playing with us?

571
01:18:08,109 --> 01:18:10,339
He lives in the area
he told you.

572
01:18:10,444 --> 01:18:12,435
He lives there?

573
01:18:12,913 --> 01:18:15,381
You're going to take us.

574
01:18:54,524 --> 01:18:56,151
They're over there.

575
01:18:59,729 --> 01:19:02,061
The police, the police.

576
01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:03,829
Run... run.

577
01:19:30,661 --> 01:19:31,719
Get down.

578
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,428
Mom, stay here tonight.

579
01:20:41,568 --> 01:20:45,527
I can't, I have to get these kids home.
It's almost dawn.

580
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:47,731
But this fucking guy
is really drunk.

581
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:52,207
Drunk my ass. I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

582
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,875
Stay a little while,
the party's just starting.

583
01:20:54,982 --> 01:20:58,008
I would like to, but these kids
have soccer practice tomorrow.

584
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,177
See you soon, Son.

585
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,379
Congratulations, my darling.

586
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:06,358
Take care of my grandchild.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

587
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,893
Seriously, you're not drunk man?

588
01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:11,431
Drunk my ass.
I'm fine. I'll be back.

589
01:21:11,565 --> 01:21:15,525
Remember, they got you once already
and you got in a lot of trouble.

590
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,733
Bye, Ma...

591
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,400
If things don't work here,
I'll meet you with the 'gringos.'

592
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:55,371
Hey, be careful.

593
01:22:01,285 --> 01:22:04,812
I'll cross the border
through Tecate...

594
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:07,720
that will get us to
San Diego super fast.

595
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:28,039
Papers?

596
01:22:31,182 --> 01:22:33,742
- Where you coming from?
- From Mexico.

597
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:38,720
From a wedding.

598
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:41,522
Where you from?

599
01:22:41,826 --> 01:22:43,726
From Valle de Guadalupe.

600
01:22:46,264 --> 01:22:48,232
Valle de Guadalupe.

601
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,198
Where you headed today?

602
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:53,702
To San Diego. We're going...
I'm taking them.

603
01:22:56,409 --> 01:22:58,377
- Who are they?
- Her nephews.

604
01:22:58,644 --> 01:23:00,942
Her nephews.
They don't look like you, ma'am.

605
01:23:01,046 --> 01:23:03,879
No, no, no, no. I'm in charge of them.

606
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:06,608
- Do you have their passports?
- Yes.

607
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:23,530
Is there a problem?

608
01:23:26,973 --> 01:23:28,497
Should there be one?

609
01:23:35,715 --> 01:23:37,580
Wait right here just a minute.

610
01:23:43,758 --> 01:23:46,784
Don't say anything.
Let me do the talking.

611
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:49,119
But you're provoking him.

612
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:50,993
I was just kidding.

613
01:23:52,934 --> 01:23:54,902
Can you open your trunk, sir?

614
01:23:55,536 --> 01:23:57,197
- What?
- Open your trunk.

615
01:23:57,305 --> 01:23:58,602
Yes, yes, yes.

616
01:24:25,834 --> 01:24:27,267
Close it up.

617
01:24:30,573 --> 01:24:32,302
Get back in the vehicle.

618
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,079
Glove compartment, ma'am.

619
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:45,518
Purse?

620
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:09,940
All right.

621
01:25:15,052 --> 01:25:18,784
What now?
Motherfucker...

622
01:25:25,897 --> 01:25:26,921
Ma'am?

623
01:25:27,032 --> 01:25:28,693
- You said you were in charge of them?
- Yes.

624
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,667
We need the parents' letters
of permission.

625
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:33,694
Parents' letters?

626
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:35,763
What's that?

627
01:25:54,894 --> 01:25:56,156
Hey there, sweetie.

628
01:25:56,596 --> 01:25:58,791
Tell me, is this lady here your auntie?

629
01:25:59,432 --> 01:26:01,332
No, she's not my auntie.

630
01:26:03,269 --> 01:26:04,702
She's in charge.

631
01:26:04,804 --> 01:26:06,328
- Are you drunk, sir?
- Me?

632
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:08,533
- Are you intoxicated?
- No.

633
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:10,967
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to step out the vehicle.

634
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,945
- Why?
- I need you to step out the vehicle now.

635
01:26:14,047 --> 01:26:16,174
I need you to step out the vehicle now!

636
01:26:16,283 --> 01:26:18,217
- Sir, can I explain?
- No, you cannot explain!

637
01:26:18,318 --> 01:26:21,082
I'm telling you
that you will step out the vehicle!

638
01:26:21,188 --> 01:26:23,281
Don't make me ask you again!

639
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:25,551
Wait, sir. Get back into the vehicle.

640
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:27,354
What you're gonna do now
is you're gonna follow me

641
01:26:27,461 --> 01:26:28,621
to the secondary inspection area.

642
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:30,026
- Can I explain?
- No, you cannot explain.

643
01:26:30,163 --> 01:26:31,755
Sir, you will shut your mouth
and you will follow me...

644
01:26:31,865 --> 01:26:34,494
I heard you... stop shouting.

645
01:26:34,602 --> 01:26:36,433
You will park your vehicle
and you will get out.

646
01:26:36,537 --> 01:26:37,663
Don't shout at me.

647
01:26:37,772 --> 01:26:40,536
You will shut your mouth and you will
do as you're told. Follow me!

648
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:42,142
Stop shouting at me.

649
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:44,706
Step out of the vehicle as told.

650
01:26:44,812 --> 01:26:46,677
Easy Santiago, please.

651
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:53,619
Upon passing this van, you'll turn to
the right and park your vehicle.

652
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:11,970
I got a port runner.

653
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:13,533
What are you doing?

654
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:18,637
I got a port runner! Tecate border!
Officer Brigg, Tecate border!

655
01:27:22,452 --> 01:27:25,148
What are you doing, Santiago?
What are you doing!

656
01:27:25,255 --> 01:27:28,520
See, I told you!
You shouldn't have brought them.

657
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:32,220
Santiago, stop acting like a
madman and stop the car.

658
01:27:33,263 --> 01:27:34,355
Please, Santiago, stop!

659
01:27:34,764 --> 01:27:37,494
Shut those kids up!
Shut them up!

660
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:01,353
Sweetie, everything is okay.

661
01:28:04,428 --> 01:28:05,486
Don't cry.

662
01:28:05,596 --> 01:28:07,723
Please stop, Santiago.

663
01:28:13,138 --> 01:28:18,371
Motherfuckers, fucking gringo assholes,
here they come.

664
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:04,214
Get out. Get out.

665
01:29:04,324 --> 01:29:05,518
Are you crazy? Where?

666
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:08,924
Get out. If they catch us,
we're all screwed...

667
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:11,622
I'll lose them,
then come back for you.

668
01:29:11,732 --> 01:29:12,892
Get out, for Christ sake!

669
01:29:14,168 --> 01:29:15,226
Santiago, calm down.

670
01:29:15,636 --> 01:29:20,130
Aunt Amelia, get out...
for the love of God!

671
01:29:20,908 --> 01:29:22,535
Get out, kids.

672
01:29:28,983 --> 01:29:31,008
Come on, come on, get out!

673
01:29:43,464 --> 01:29:46,297
Santiago is going to
come back soon and...

674
01:29:46,401 --> 01:29:48,961
the sun is going to rise.

675
01:29:56,111 --> 01:29:58,204
I want to go home now.

676
01:29:59,882 --> 01:30:01,474
Be careful, baby.

677
01:30:50,368 --> 01:30:51,665
Thank you.

678
01:31:04,549 --> 01:31:05,982
Is that your daughter?

679
01:31:06,818 --> 01:31:09,343
Yes. The third of five.

680
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:15,454
- Do you have kids?
- Yeah.

681
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:41,281
- Just two?
- Yeah.

682
01:31:44,023 --> 01:31:45,718
You should have more.

683
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:59,398
What about you?
How many wives you have?

684
01:32:00,441 --> 01:32:02,306
I can only afford one.

685
01:32:15,856 --> 01:32:17,654
Come on! Find another ambulance!
Do something!

686
01:32:17,759 --> 01:32:19,556
Why can't you call
another ambulance?

687
01:32:19,661 --> 01:32:22,061
They just told me
the ambulance isn't coming.

688
01:32:22,163 --> 01:32:24,495
And you know we don't
have another ambulance.

689
01:32:26,534 --> 01:32:28,365
There isn't another ambulance.

690
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,734
What do you mean, there's no
other ambulance? What do you mean?

691
01:32:30,839 --> 01:32:34,275
Fucking move! Fucking find me
an ambulance! Find me an ambulance!

692
01:32:34,376 --> 01:32:36,674
He wants to know how
he will get his wife out of here.

693
01:32:36,778 --> 01:32:39,713
Tell him they said
his embassy will deal with it.

694
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:42,514
- Your embassy will deal with it.
- What can my embassy do?

695
01:32:42,618 --> 01:32:45,553
This is your fucked-up country! It's your
responsibility! You do something!

696
01:32:45,654 --> 01:32:48,384
The Americans
stopped the ambulance.

697
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:51,358
They want to send a helicopter,
but there are problems.

698
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,485
He says it's your embassy
who stopped the ambulance

699
01:32:53,596 --> 01:32:55,029
and they will send a helicopter.

700
01:32:55,131 --> 01:32:59,033
Now I'm supposed to wait for
a helicopter? Fucking do something!

701
01:32:59,602 --> 01:33:01,570
Fuck you! Fuck you!

702
01:33:05,374 --> 01:33:06,933
- How's your wife?
- We can't stay here any longer.

703
01:33:07,044 --> 01:33:08,875
- Stay away from me.
- It's gonna get dark soon.

704
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:11,504
People are not feeling well.
It's dangerous.

705
01:33:11,615 --> 01:33:13,412
Don't you push me!

706
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:15,417
Fuck that! We're leaving!

707
01:33:16,987 --> 01:33:20,047
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

708
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:21,487
Take it easy!

709
01:33:21,591 --> 01:33:23,889
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Calm down. Come here.

710
01:33:24,995 --> 01:33:26,587
- Get off me!
- Calm down!

711
01:33:26,997 --> 01:33:29,864
If you leave, I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

712
01:33:30,467 --> 01:33:32,402
Come with us. Come with us.

713
01:33:32,503 --> 01:33:33,902
Are you all right?

714
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:39,171
No, we need help now.
We need help now. Do you understand?

715
01:33:39,277 --> 01:33:41,677
<i>I'm doing everything I can do.
I've got the State Department</i>

716
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:43,144
<i>on the other line right now.</i>

717
01:33:43,247 --> 01:33:44,441
<i>They're doing everything they can do.</i>

718
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:46,414
<i>Due to some political problems
that are being resolved...</i>

719
01:33:46,517 --> 01:33:49,042
I don't give a shit about
political problems. I need help now.

720
01:33:49,153 --> 01:33:53,419
<i>Everybody is doing everything they can.
Okay? I don't know what else I can do.</i>

721
01:33:53,524 --> 01:33:54,957
<i>It's all over the news.</i>

722
01:33:55,059 --> 01:33:59,326
<i>Everybody is paying attention
and doing everything that they can.</i>

723
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:00,489
<i>Richard...</i>

724
01:34:13,245 --> 01:34:17,875
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

725
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:12,297
Good evening.

726
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,637
The doorman called to say
you wanted to talk to me.

727
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:16,833
I don't understand.

728
01:35:16,945 --> 01:35:19,470
Could you speak slowly?

729
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:22,507
I'm sorry.

730
01:35:24,019 --> 01:35:27,455
What was it
you wanted to tell me?

731
01:35:42,271 --> 01:35:44,466
Do you have tea?

732
01:36:15,739 --> 01:36:19,368
<i>"My father had nothing to do
with my mother's death."</i>

733
01:36:22,813 --> 01:36:23,940
What's this?

734
01:36:44,135 --> 01:36:49,472
When your mother jumped off the
balcony, your father was asleep?

735
01:37:39,927 --> 01:37:41,224
You saw her jump?

736
01:37:50,604 --> 01:37:52,663
You've already told the other officers?

737
01:38:07,022 --> 01:38:08,887
What are you talking about?

738
01:38:54,138 --> 01:38:57,574
Does your father still hunt?

739
01:39:14,358 --> 01:39:18,819
There was an incident involving a rifle
in your father's name.

740
01:39:19,364 --> 01:39:22,731
That's why we want to talk to him.
Understand?

741
01:40:03,942 --> 01:40:10,644
Your father isn't going to jail.
We just need to talk to him.

742
01:40:19,391 --> 01:40:20,585
I have to go.

743
01:40:24,096 --> 01:40:25,563
I really have to go.

744
01:41:33,769 --> 01:41:35,430
What are you doing?

745
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:48,745
What are you doing?

746
01:41:57,727 --> 01:41:58,751
Please stop.

747
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:04,427
No, this is wrong.
You're just a girl.

748
01:42:10,975 --> 01:42:12,499
Enough, stop it!

749
01:43:00,993 --> 01:43:02,290
Give me that rifle.

750
01:43:02,395 --> 01:43:03,384
They're going to kill us.

751
01:43:08,034 --> 01:43:09,228
They're going to kill us.

752
01:44:16,305 --> 01:44:21,641
I killed the American. I was the
only one who shot at you.

753
01:44:27,049 --> 01:44:30,212
They did nothing... nothing.

754
01:44:34,957 --> 01:44:41,124
Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing.

755
01:44:50,607 --> 01:44:54,509
Save my brother...
he did nothing.

756
01:45:47,566 --> 01:45:48,863
Help!

757
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,597
Help!

758
01:45:53,506 --> 01:45:54,996
Help!

759
01:46:03,015 --> 01:46:04,141
Help!

760
01:46:26,006 --> 01:46:27,633
What's happening?

761
01:46:28,675 --> 01:46:32,304
Why are we hiding
if we didn't even do anything wrong?

762
01:46:32,412 --> 01:46:37,111
Because they think
we did something wrong, baby.

763
01:46:37,818 --> 01:46:41,380
That's not true. You're bad.

764
01:46:43,258 --> 01:46:46,625
No, sweetie. No, I'm not.

765
01:46:47,695 --> 01:46:50,493
I just did something stupid.

766
01:48:30,836 --> 01:48:34,272
Sweetie, I have to go look for help.

767
01:48:34,373 --> 01:48:38,867
- Stay here and don't move, please.
- I'm not staying here alone.

768
01:48:40,379 --> 01:48:44,077
Honey, you have to take care
of Debbie, baby.

769
01:48:45,451 --> 01:48:47,180
I'm going with you.

770
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:52,118
I won't be long. I promise. Stay here.

771
01:48:52,925 --> 01:48:54,620
Don't move. Okay?

772
01:48:55,094 --> 01:48:57,062
I won't be long, baby.

773
01:49:57,059 --> 01:49:58,026
Drink.

774
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:56,853
I have to go and get two kids
I left behind in the desert. Please?

775
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:00,951
They're Americans.

776
01:51:01,058 --> 01:51:04,221
- When did you cross?
- I didn't cross. I live here.

777
01:51:04,328 --> 01:51:07,923
Please, please, help me find those kids.

778
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,660
Stand here. Don't move.

779
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,073
Attention, Dispatch.
I think I got the suspect.

780
01:51:27,352 --> 01:51:29,684
Ma'am, you're under arrest.
You want to turn around

781
01:51:29,788 --> 01:51:32,552
and put your hands
behind your head, please.

782
01:51:32,925 --> 01:51:35,554
I live with those kids, I swear!

783
01:51:35,929 --> 01:51:39,023
- Turn around.
- Please, sir, those kids will die!

784
01:51:39,666 --> 01:51:40,860
Thank you.

785
01:51:54,647 --> 01:51:55,671
Then we'll get you some water.

786
01:51:55,782 --> 01:51:58,751
They're alone.

787
01:52:00,554 --> 01:52:03,148
They are children,
they will die.

788
01:52:04,358 --> 01:52:06,417
You're gonna take me to them, okay?

789
01:52:38,526 --> 01:52:40,118
Ma'am, are you with them?

790
01:53:14,164 --> 01:53:15,188
<i>Richard?</i>

791
01:53:20,604 --> 01:53:21,730
What?

792
01:53:23,974 --> 01:53:27,808
If I die, you take care of the kids.

793
01:53:30,314 --> 01:53:32,179
Especially Mike. He really needs you.

794
01:53:32,282 --> 01:53:35,581
You're not gonna die. You can't die.
You just can't.

795
01:53:36,653 --> 01:53:38,952
Don't you ever leave them again.

796
01:53:41,659 --> 01:53:43,559
I will never leave them.

797
01:53:54,005 --> 01:53:56,803
- I peed my pants.
- What?

798
01:53:58,743 --> 01:54:02,407
I couldn't hold it in and I peed.

799
01:54:12,558 --> 01:54:14,423
I've got to pee again.

800
01:54:20,733 --> 01:54:24,294
Do you have a pan we could use?
A pan?

801
01:54:31,111 --> 01:54:33,204
Could you give us
a few moments alone?

802
01:54:33,313 --> 01:54:34,871
Yeah, of course.

803
01:54:48,361 --> 01:54:49,953
There.

804
01:54:50,063 --> 01:54:51,361
Now sit.

805
01:54:53,334 --> 01:54:54,631
I can't.

806
01:55:00,074 --> 01:55:02,542
Yep. Yeah, I can.

807
01:56:02,738 --> 01:56:04,569
Forgive me, my love.

808
01:56:07,311 --> 01:56:09,006
When Sammy died,

809
01:56:11,215 --> 01:56:12,443
I didn't...

810
01:56:18,689 --> 01:56:19,986
I ran.

811
01:56:28,365 --> 01:56:31,358
- I was scared.
- I was scared, too.

812
01:56:33,304 --> 01:56:35,670
- It wasn't my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.

813
01:56:35,807 --> 01:56:37,968
- It wasn't my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.

814
01:56:38,076 --> 01:56:40,067
He wasn't breathing.

815
01:56:40,178 --> 01:56:41,645
I couldn't...

816
01:56:45,049 --> 01:56:46,744
I love you so much.

817
01:56:57,129 --> 01:56:59,063
I'm forgetting his face.

818
01:57:00,933 --> 01:57:02,730
<i>Hello? Richard Jones?</i>

819
01:57:02,868 --> 01:57:04,699
<i>I'm very sorry about
what happened to your wife,</i>

820
01:57:04,803 --> 01:57:06,828
<i>but you can be sure that the culprits
will be punished.</i>

821
01:57:06,939 --> 01:57:08,372
<i>What the fuck is taking so long?</i>

822
01:57:08,474 --> 01:57:10,772
<i>Well, the Moroccan government
wouldn't let us use their airspace.</i>

823
01:57:10,876 --> 01:57:13,242
<i>They refused to acknowledge
that this was an act of terrorism.</i>

824
01:57:13,345 --> 01:57:14,972
<i>What about the ambulance?</i>

825
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,548
<i>Taking your safety into consideration,
Mr. Jones, we didn't believe</i>

826
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:20,176
<i>it would be appropriate
to send a Moroccan ambulance.</i>

827
01:57:20,287 --> 01:57:23,017
<i>Stay put. We settled the matter.
A helicopter should arrive soon.</i>

828
01:57:23,123 --> 01:57:24,317
<i>- How long?
- Soon.</i>

829
01:57:24,424 --> 01:57:25,721
<i>No! How long?</i>

830
01:57:32,732 --> 01:57:34,996
There's no need to apologize.

831
01:59:39,931 --> 01:59:41,899
It's a miracle
we found those kids, ma'am.

832
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,300
I don't know how you could have left
them alone like that out in the desert.

833
01:59:47,606 --> 01:59:50,769
- How are they, sir?
- That's none of your business.

834
01:59:52,278 --> 01:59:56,146
You know how many kids die every year
trying to cross this border?

835
01:59:59,685 --> 02:00:02,916
I raised these kids since they were born.

836
02:00:03,622 --> 02:00:06,591
I take care of them day and night.

837
02:00:06,959 --> 02:00:10,224
I feed them breakfast
and lunch and dinner.

838
02:00:10,863 --> 02:00:12,832
I play with them.

839
02:00:13,867 --> 02:00:16,859
Mike and Debbie
are like my own children.

840
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:19,564
But they are not your children, ma'am.

841
02:00:20,907 --> 02:00:24,104
Plus, you've been working
in this country illegally.

842
02:00:31,752 --> 02:00:34,380
What about my nephew, Santiago?

843
02:00:34,521 --> 02:00:36,990
I don't have any information on him.

844
02:00:37,792 --> 02:00:39,692
We located the father in Morocco.

845
02:00:39,794 --> 02:00:43,093
He was very angry,
but decided not to press charges.

846
02:00:43,998 --> 02:00:45,056
Thank you.

847
02:00:45,166 --> 02:00:47,134
Nevertheless the government
of the United States

848
02:00:47,235 --> 02:00:49,567
has deemed that you are
seriously breaking the law,

849
02:00:49,670 --> 02:00:53,128
and is determined to immediately
and definitively deport you.

850
02:00:55,676 --> 02:00:59,635
Sir, I've been here for 16 years.

851
02:01:01,183 --> 02:01:05,119
I have my things here. I rent a house.

852
02:01:05,654 --> 02:01:07,849
I made a life here, sir.

853
02:01:07,956 --> 02:01:10,823
You should have thought
about that beforehand.

854
02:01:16,965 --> 02:01:18,990
I want to talk to a lawyer.

855
02:01:19,968 --> 02:01:23,404
If you attempt to take this to trial,
I can assure you,

856
02:01:24,006 --> 02:01:26,840
you'll only be prolonging the inevitable.

857
02:01:27,977 --> 02:01:30,946
I recommend you accept
voluntary deportation.

858
02:05:30,629 --> 02:05:32,791
<i>The sources of the attack
are not yet known.</i>

859
02:05:32,899 --> 02:05:37,836
<i>But it is clear that Moroccan
and US government officials</i>

860
02:05:37,937 --> 02:05:42,271
<i>are working quickly
to secure the area for all citizens.</i>

861
02:05:42,375 --> 02:05:46,937
<i>Locals reported Susan Jones,
an American mother of two...</i>

862
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:50,478
Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford,
the US ambassador.

863
02:06:08,669 --> 02:06:11,695
We will find these people.
Whoever they are, we will find them.

864
02:06:11,805 --> 02:06:14,968
Thank you very much.
That's all I have to say now.

865
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:39,865
Mr. Jones?

866
02:06:41,769 --> 02:06:44,294
I'm going to have to
operate immediately.

867
02:06:44,405 --> 02:06:45,873
Is she gonna be all right?

868
02:06:46,809 --> 02:06:49,778
It's probable.
We're gonna try to save her arm.

869
02:06:50,212 --> 02:06:53,204
She's been bleeding internally
and there's been some clotting,

870
02:06:53,315 --> 02:06:55,647
so there's a high risk of gangrene.

871
02:06:57,253 --> 02:06:59,380
But is she gonna be all right?

872
02:07:01,924 --> 02:07:03,391
Excuse me, sir.

873
02:07:19,209 --> 02:07:21,575
<i>- Yes?
- Amelia?</i>

874
02:07:22,679 --> 02:07:24,010
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

875
02:07:24,114 --> 02:07:26,014
Hi, how's everything?

876
02:07:26,116 --> 02:07:28,016
<i>Everything is okay, sir.</i>

877
02:07:28,118 --> 02:07:31,781
<i>Mrs. Rachel told me.
I am very sorry, sir.</i>

878
02:07:32,522 --> 02:07:33,819
<i>How's Mrs. Susan?</i>

879
02:07:33,924 --> 02:07:37,554
She's better now.
They're going to have to operate, but...

880
02:07:38,062 --> 02:07:40,758
Look, Rachel's flying in tonight.

881
02:07:40,898 --> 02:07:44,459
She's gonna find someone to
take care of the kids so you can go.

882
02:07:45,803 --> 02:07:48,966
<i>Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.</i>

883
02:07:51,542 --> 02:07:54,272
So, look after them, okay?
Don't tell them anything.

884
02:07:54,378 --> 02:07:56,812
<i>No, no, no. Don't worry, sir.
Don't worry.</i>

885
02:07:56,981 --> 02:07:58,039
Okay.

886
02:07:58,583 --> 02:08:00,745
Put Mike on, please.

887
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,818
<i>Mike? Your dad is calling.</i>

888
02:08:08,727 --> 02:08:11,321
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?</i>

889
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:15,457
<i>Good. Dad, guess what? Today
they brought hermit crabs to class.</i>

890
02:08:15,567 --> 02:08:16,659
Oh, really?

891
02:08:17,603 --> 02:08:22,233
<i>I held one in my hands. It bit me.
It really didn't bleed, but...</i>

892
02:08:23,442 --> 02:08:25,411
<i>Dad? Are you okay?</i>

893
02:08:27,046 --> 02:08:29,173
I'm okay. Everything's fine.

894
02:08:29,282 --> 02:08:32,149
<i>Mariana wanted to take one home.
But the teacher didn't let her. She was...</i>

895
02:08:32,418 --> 02:08:35,251
<i>I felt sad for her 'cause
she went to the principal's office.</i>

896
02:08:35,355 --> 02:08:38,188
<i>You know what she did?
She started crying.</i>

897
02:08:38,291 --> 02:08:41,590
<i>She was really crying.
And the teacher had to send her</i>

898
02:08:41,761 --> 02:08:46,027
<i>to the principal's office
'cause she was really crying.</i>

899
02:09:08,389 --> 02:09:13,623
Mr. Wataya, this officer
has been looking for you.

900
02:09:17,265 --> 02:09:21,668
Good evening, I'm Lieutenant Mamiya.

901
02:09:22,671 --> 02:09:24,866
Good evening, how can I help you?

902
02:09:27,509 --> 02:09:30,342
Sir, there was an incident and...

903
02:09:31,546 --> 02:09:33,446
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

904
02:09:33,615 --> 02:09:37,278
do you own a .270 caliber
Winchester M70 rifle?

905
02:09:38,654 --> 02:09:40,451
Registration number...

906
02:09:42,992 --> 02:09:45,392
UK-9023.

907
02:09:46,195 --> 02:09:49,687
I don't remember the number,
but I did have a rifle like that.

908
02:09:50,499 --> 02:09:53,332
Is it true that you gave that rifle
to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim...

909
02:09:53,469 --> 02:09:55,096
who lives in Morocco?

910
02:09:55,404 --> 02:09:56,428
Hassan Ibrahim?

911
02:09:58,341 --> 02:10:01,003
He says he was
your guide in a hunt.

912
02:10:01,277 --> 02:10:03,303
Hassan? Yes,
I remember him well.

913
02:10:03,413 --> 02:10:09,079
He was a good guide and a very
good man, I gave him the rifle in thanks.

914
02:10:11,288 --> 02:10:12,755
Did anything happen?

915
02:10:13,957 --> 02:10:17,154
That rifle was used
in an attempted murder...

916
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:21,321
and the Moroccan police want
to confirm it's not off the black market.

917
02:10:21,431 --> 02:10:23,991
No, I gave it to him.

918
02:10:25,869 --> 02:10:28,361
Is Hassan OK?

919
02:10:29,841 --> 02:10:31,638
I don't know about that.

920
02:10:36,114 --> 02:10:38,275
Am I legally involved?

921
02:10:38,649 --> 02:10:43,746
Not for the moment, but can you
come down to the station tomorrow?

922
02:10:43,988 --> 02:10:45,615
I have a few questions.

923
02:10:47,825 --> 02:10:48,849
Can I leave now?

924
02:10:50,128 --> 02:10:51,618
Good night.

925
02:10:55,801 --> 02:10:56,927
Excuse me.

926
02:10:58,937 --> 02:11:03,840
I heard from your daughter...
about your wife on the balcony.

927
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:06,375
I'm very sorry.

928
02:11:07,246 --> 02:11:08,611
What balcony?

929
02:11:10,516 --> 02:11:14,452
About how your wife killed herself
by jumping off the balcony.

930
02:11:22,395 --> 02:11:26,991
My wife never jumped off a balcony.
She shot herself in the head.

931
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:29,295
My daughter was the first to find her.

932
02:11:31,337 --> 02:11:33,999
I've explained it
to the police many times.

933
02:11:35,842 --> 02:11:38,310
Don't bother us with that anymore.

934
02:11:39,446 --> 02:11:42,075
I'm very sorry sir, we won't
bother you anymore.

935
02:11:42,483 --> 02:11:43,677
Good night.

936
02:12:36,272 --> 02:12:37,864
Another shochu.

937
02:13:16,179 --> 02:13:19,239
<i>Susan Jones, who was wounded
in a terrorist attack in Morocco...</i>

938
02:13:19,349 --> 02:13:23,286
<i>was discharged from a Casablanca
hospital this morning, local time.</i>

939
02:13:23,454 --> 02:13:27,220
<i>The American people finally have
a happy ending, after five days...</i>

940
02:13:27,325 --> 02:13:30,590
<i>of frantic phone calls
and hand wringing.</i>
