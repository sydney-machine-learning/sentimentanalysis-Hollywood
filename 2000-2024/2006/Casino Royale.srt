1
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,071
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,943
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,150
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,849
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,420
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,565
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,968
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,832
...l'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,337
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,936
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes--
-Two.

11
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,894
Shame.

12
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,564
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,797
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,834
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,204
True.

16
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,447
How did he die?

17
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,117
Your contact?

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,808
Not well.

19
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,759
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,000
Well...

21
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,432
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,567
The second is--

23
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,378
Yes.

24
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,240
Considerably.

25
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,654
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,423
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,855
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

28
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,931
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,401
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,303
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,379
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,210
No.

33
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,080
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,552
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,019
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,022
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,419
Yes.

38
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,608
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,477
<i>...of Skyfleet stock.</i>

40
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,553
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,919
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,822
Just do it.

43
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,065
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,263
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,518
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,622
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,517
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,786
-Sorry?
-Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,759
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,909
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,510
...my dear general.

52
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,742
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,385
All in.

54
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,317
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,621
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,388
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,755
-We have less than 36 hours. I can--
-No. No, no.

58
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,692
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,628
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,134
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,446
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,143
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,548
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,453
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,458
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,323
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,399
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,002
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,729
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,567
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,607
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,882
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,579
Sorry.

74
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,588
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,454
Or yourself.

76
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,686
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,422
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,225
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,369
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,265
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

81
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,675
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:32,935
I did.

83
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,137
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,145
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:42,175
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,877
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,216
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,656
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,692
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,764
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,298
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,094
The same way
I found out your name.

93
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,239
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for--

94
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,909
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,107
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

96
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:13,584
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,980
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:27,130
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,699
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,032
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,104
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,708
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,435
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,408
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,245
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,480
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,056
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,160
Because these bastards
want your head.

109
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,820
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,164
And Bond...

111
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,172
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,048
Ma'am.

113
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,589
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,828
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,639
Hello.

116
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,974
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,485
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,831
<i>Security to car park.
Security to car park.</i>

119
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,728
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,324
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,972
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,572
Okay.

123
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,443
-We have an ocean-view villa.
-Perfect.

124
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,814
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,977
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,282
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know--?

127
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,925
-Mr. Dimitrios.
-Right.

128
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,859
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,758
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

130
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,602
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,864
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,804
Thank you.

133
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,599
-What?
-He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,240
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,410
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,670
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,747
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,315
<i>Well, I'm doing my best to find out.</i>

139
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:31,386
<i>-Who's he looking at?
-Alex Dimitrios.</i>

140
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,416
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,902
Now known associates....

142
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,048
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,128
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,799
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,235
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,076
-Look what just happened.
-Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,505
Yeah.

148
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,353
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,784
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Good evening.

150
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,369
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,231
I'm in.

152
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,336
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,776
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,613
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,752
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,448
I heard you.

157
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,857
Five to call.

158
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,763
-Action's to you.
-Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,332
Ace high.

160
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,471
Check or bet.

161
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,162
-Check.
-And to you.

162
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,308
Five thousand.

163
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,711
Five to call.

164
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,925
-Check.
-Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,924
All in.

166
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,396
No, wait.

167
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,268
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,003
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,601
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,145
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,341
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,291
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,735
Three kings.

174
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,673
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,277
Trip aces.

176
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,573
Aces win.

177
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,616
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,391
Thank you.

179
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,060
Sir.

180
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,559
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,760
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,195
My mistake.

183
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,664
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,705
That would really send him
over the edge.

185
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,842
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,135
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

187
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,217
Perhaps.

188
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,150
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

189
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,048
Your place?

190
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,326
-Is it close?
-Very.

191
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,601
One drink.

192
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,522
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

193
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,631
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,939
<i>I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.</i>

195
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,811
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:05,512
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,793
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,562
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,731
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,930
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

201
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,932
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,534
...and payment.

203
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,146
You like married women,
don't you, James?

204
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,550
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,291
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,465
You, my husband....

207
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,328
I had so many chances
to be happy...

208
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,901
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,801
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

210
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,238
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,441
Yes.

212
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,015
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,890
What makes your husband
a bad man?

214
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,652
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,523
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,393
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:29,370
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,041
How afraid?

219
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,408
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,148
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,487
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

222
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,061
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

223
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,374
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,907
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,038
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,146
<i>I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.</i>

227
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,977
<i>Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.</i>

228
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,517
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,485
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,428
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,793
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,103
In that case...

233
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,431
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,005
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,313
<i>Good evening. Room Service.</i>

236
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,316
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,748
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,423
<i>-With everything?
-Yes, with everything.</i>

239
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,717
<i>-And would that be for two, sir?
-What?</i>

240
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,191
<i>-For two?
-No, for one.</i>

241
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,025
Wait here.

242
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,265
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,608
<i>Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...</i>

244
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,645
<i>...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...</i>

245
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,611
<i>...nervous and vascular systems.</i>

246
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,611
<i>Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

247
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,514
<i>I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.</i>

248
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,879
<i>This is edutainment.</i>

249
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,407
<i>--fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...</i>

250
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:35,483
<i>...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.</i>

251
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,157
Hello.

252
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,268
Hello.

253
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,438
<i>Do not leave your vehicle unattended.</i>

254
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,209
<i>Welcome to Miami
International Airport.</i>

255
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,547
<i>Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted....</i>

256
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,542
-Yes.
-It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,483
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,955
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,720
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,858
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?
-I thought you might.

261
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,033
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,864
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,998
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
-What about it?

264
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:41,433
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:23,870
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,673
<i>Bond? Bond!</i>

267
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,778
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,922
<i>It's launching today.</i>

269
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,119
I gotta go.

270
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,188
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,822
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:46,719
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:52,327
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,029
Someone talked.

275
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,761
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,022
I'm gonna get a few more photos....

277
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:46,439
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

278
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,980
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,814
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,616
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,792
No.

282
00:54:56,993 --> 00:55:00,451
-Not your name, what you were after?
-No.

283
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,097
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,062
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

285
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,700
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,529
He worked with anyone
who had money.

287
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,104
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,208
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,868
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,843
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,609
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:26,380
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,142
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,978
Yes.

295
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:08,022
<i>When they analyzed
the stock market after 9l11...</i>

296
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,530
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,566
<i>When the stocks hit bottom on 9l12,
somebody made a fortune.</i>

298
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,832
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,270
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:24,243
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,474
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,386
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,523
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,419
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:40,687
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,661
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,427
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,604
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:53,071
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,677
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,713
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,281
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,714
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,753
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,685
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,554
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,322
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,563
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:26,539
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,906
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,444
No.

322
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,144
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:38,684
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,253
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,149
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,625
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,876
Thank you.

328
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,255
I'm the money.

329
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,822
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,357
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,395
"Vesper."

332
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:29,094
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,306
Thank you.

334
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,169
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,810
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,039
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,582
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,309
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,855
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,084
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:55,196
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,967
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,008
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,181
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,044
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,485
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,354
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,050
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,626
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,195
-And you're good at reading people?
-Yes, I am.

351
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,094
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,428
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:37,004
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,269
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,966
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,738
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,178
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,408
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,780
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,580
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,048
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

362
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,251
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,020
True, but this one
overcompensates...

364
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,061
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,632
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,303
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:11,837
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,236
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,208
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,741
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,045
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,916
...l'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,827
All right.

374
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,256
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,832
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,935
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,037
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,799
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,943
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,011
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,705
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,907
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,847
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,156
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,123
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,729
...since Ml6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,195
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,596
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:14,895
You know...

390
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:19,040
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,908
-Rolex?
-Omega.

392
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,942
Beautiful.

393
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,108
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,148
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,717
No, of course not.

396
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,615
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

397
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,983
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,284
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,888
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,531
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,701
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,693
You noticed?

403
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:49,895
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,437
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,399
Skewered.

406
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,236
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,570
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,113
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,601
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-That's right.

410
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,101
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

411
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,418
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,854
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,563
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,460
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,836
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,594
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest--

417
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,000
-I am not.
-You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,175
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,276
We've been involved
for quite a while...

420
01:03:02,873 --> 01:03:04,636
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:04,842 --> 01:03:07,208
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,141
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:10,347 --> 01:03:13,612
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,317
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,488
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:21,453
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:21,692 --> 01:03:22,784
Smart?

428
01:03:23,394 --> 01:03:25,089
Single.

429
01:03:44,314 --> 01:03:46,305
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:46,517 --> 01:03:49,384
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:49,586 --> 01:03:52,316
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:52,956 --> 01:03:55,288
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:02,292
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:04,091
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:08,264
Very funny.

436
01:04:08,472 --> 01:04:10,440
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:12,541
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:15,140
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:17,711
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:20,213
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:22,942
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:24,880
And now he knows
something about you.

443
01:04:25,089 --> 01:04:27,284
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:29,722
Take the next one.

445
01:04:29,927 --> 01:04:32,794
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:33,197 --> 01:04:34,755
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:37,297
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.

448
01:05:08,432 --> 01:05:09,956
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:54,338
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:57,848 --> 01:05:59,406
Does he know
we've been watching him?

451
01:05:59,616 --> 01:06:02,278
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:02,486 --> 01:06:06,820
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:09,425
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

454
01:06:09,626 --> 01:06:13,357
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:14,898 --> 01:06:16,695
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,134 --> 01:06:20,661
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:24,206
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:26,308
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,068
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,341
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:31,548 --> 01:06:33,516
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:36,345
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:36,553 --> 01:06:39,716
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:39,923 --> 01:06:43,120
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,235 --> 01:06:52,395
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:56,562
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

467
01:06:57,641 --> 01:07:00,838
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:03,308
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:04,848 --> 01:07:07,942
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,151 --> 01:07:11,746
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:16,289
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:21,857
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:27,337 --> 01:07:28,702
Yes?

474
01:07:29,373 --> 01:07:31,034
For you.

475
01:07:32,209 --> 01:07:34,700
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,511
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:38,715 --> 01:07:41,013
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,218 --> 01:07:43,584
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:43,787 --> 01:07:45,516
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:45,722 --> 01:07:48,122
Do you think you can
do that for me?

481
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,259
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:51,328 --> 01:07:53,262
Thank you.

483
01:08:05,275 --> 01:08:06,503
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:10,043
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:11,407
This is the latter.

486
01:08:11,615 --> 01:08:14,812
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:15,252 --> 01:08:16,879
How--?

488
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:19,155
It's tailored.

489
01:08:19,356 --> 01:08:21,916
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:15,612 --> 01:09:18,240
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

491
01:09:20,183 --> 01:09:21,844
Thank you.

492
01:09:32,629 --> 01:09:34,756
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:34,965 --> 01:09:37,058
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:38,268 --> 01:09:41,066
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:43,705
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

496
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:55,141
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:55,352 --> 01:09:57,946
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,155 --> 01:10:00,089
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

499
01:10:00,557 --> 01:10:03,321
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:03,527 --> 01:10:04,755
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:07,064 --> 01:10:09,589
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,701
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:14,996
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:17,935
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:19,301
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:19,509 --> 01:10:21,238
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:21,445 --> 01:10:23,572
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:25,876
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:26,316 --> 01:10:27,476
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:30,118
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:38,528 --> 01:10:39,688
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:55,438
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,486 --> 01:11:03,783
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:03,987 --> 01:11:07,013
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,224 --> 01:11:10,682
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:12,796 --> 01:11:14,821
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:39,780
Four players.

518
01:11:42,392 --> 01:11:43,723
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,262 --> 01:11:46,729
Check.

520
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,727
Check.

521
01:11:53,036 --> 01:11:55,095
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,318 --> 01:12:09,580
Call.

523
01:12:12,856 --> 01:12:14,118
Fold.

524
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:18,726
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,033 --> 01:12:24,466
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:35,979 --> 01:12:38,539
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:44,643
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:44,854 --> 01:12:47,880
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:50,620
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,431 --> 01:12:56,831
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:58,802 --> 01:12:59,996
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,203 --> 01:13:02,865
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:03,673 --> 01:13:05,402
Call.

534
01:13:10,547 --> 01:13:11,707
Hello.

535
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:15,510
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,847
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:19,055 --> 01:13:20,022
Champagne.

538
01:13:23,727 --> 01:13:25,592
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:37,970
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:48,147
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:52,982
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:54,986
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:57,894 --> 01:13:59,225
Fold.

544
01:14:06,603 --> 01:14:08,935
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,878
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,778
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

547
01:14:21,985 --> 01:14:23,816
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:26,853
-...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,057 --> 01:14:29,924
-You know, I'll have one of those.
-So will I.

550
01:14:30,894 --> 01:14:32,122
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,063 --> 01:14:36,965
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:39,165
That's it?

553
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:42,062
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:43,432
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,449 --> 01:14:54,383
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:07,897 --> 01:15:09,228
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,432 --> 01:15:12,367
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.

558
01:15:12,569 --> 01:15:16,266
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,473 --> 01:15:17,997
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

560
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:19,266
Good.

561
01:15:19,476 --> 01:15:22,240
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:22,445 --> 01:15:24,208
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,414 --> 01:15:27,383
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:28,017 --> 01:15:29,575
Check.

565
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,051
-You know, that's not half bad.
-Up to you.

566
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:34,155
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:35,692 --> 01:15:38,252
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:38,595 --> 01:15:39,857
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:42,255
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:46,595
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:48,998
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,205 --> 01:15:51,173
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:52,898
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:54,940
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.

575
01:15:55,145 --> 01:15:57,010
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,213 --> 01:15:58,737
Thank you.

577
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:01,983
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,185 --> 01:16:05,211
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,055 --> 01:16:07,488
Call.

580
01:16:09,092 --> 01:16:11,060
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:13,596 --> 01:16:16,121
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:18,095
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,301 --> 01:16:22,761
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:57,369
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:58,975 --> 01:17:00,840
So?

586
01:17:01,044 --> 01:17:03,171
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,379 --> 01:17:04,710
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:04,914 --> 01:17:07,849
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:35,437
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:39,473
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,352 --> 01:17:43,910
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:49,652
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

593
01:17:49,859 --> 01:17:52,089
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:56,733 --> 01:17:58,394
Thank you.

595
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:03,833
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,374 --> 01:18:06,171
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:07,977 --> 01:18:09,706
Open that.

598
01:18:25,728 --> 01:18:27,787
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:28,731 --> 01:18:30,028
All of it.

600
01:18:43,513 --> 01:18:47,472
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:53,750
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,024 --> 01:18:56,821
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,052
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:08,972 --> 01:19:11,907
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:26,221
Stairs.

606
01:19:30,727 --> 01:19:33,355
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:33,963 --> 01:19:36,523
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:38,688 --> 01:21:40,383
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:43,821
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:47,052
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:49,892 --> 01:22:52,486
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:52,829 --> 01:22:56,526
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:56,732 --> 01:22:57,960
A little.

614
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:01,728
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:05,965
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,203 --> 01:24:11,572
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:12,608 --> 01:24:14,473
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:30,059 --> 01:24:31,890
That's better.

619
01:24:35,965 --> 01:24:37,296
You cold?

620
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,899
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,101 --> 01:24:41,001
Here.

622
01:25:37,727 --> 01:25:39,991
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,363 --> 01:25:42,490
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,278 --> 01:26:00,009
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,646
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:03,853 --> 01:26:06,083
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:07,723 --> 01:26:09,953
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,493 --> 01:26:13,690
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:32,808
Call.

630
01:26:33,015 --> 01:26:34,414
Fold.

631
01:26:34,617 --> 01:26:36,585
And call.

632
01:26:37,887 --> 01:26:39,946
Three players.

633
01:26:43,559 --> 01:26:45,322
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:45,528 --> 01:26:47,189
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:49,065 --> 01:26:50,726
Call.

636
01:26:52,468 --> 01:26:53,435
And call.

637
01:26:58,607 --> 01:26:59,904
Three players.

638
01:27:04,246 --> 01:27:05,235
Check.

639
01:27:10,753 --> 01:27:11,913
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:21,797 --> 01:27:24,231
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:35,911 --> 01:27:40,211
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:42,441
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:43,552 --> 01:27:45,486
It's up to you.

644
01:27:51,627 --> 01:27:54,027
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,103 --> 01:28:03,469
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

646
01:28:04,507 --> 01:28:05,701
Fold.

647
01:28:05,908 --> 01:28:07,671
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:07,877 --> 01:28:09,435
It's up to you.

649
01:28:23,626 --> 01:28:25,093
Two.

650
01:28:25,861 --> 01:28:27,954
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:31,991
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:43,078 --> 01:28:44,943
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,354 --> 01:28:54,720
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

654
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:57,256
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:28:59,895 --> 01:29:04,264
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,201 --> 01:29:07,931
-Call.
-Call.

657
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:10,736
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,474 --> 01:29:14,874
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:15,077 --> 01:29:17,102
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:30,059 --> 01:29:33,756
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:37,766 --> 01:29:40,929
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:42,764
Please.

663
01:29:42,972 --> 01:29:45,270
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,474 --> 01:29:48,807
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:56,252 --> 01:29:57,913
Good game.

666
01:30:26,048 --> 01:30:29,381
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:29,952 --> 01:30:32,284
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:35,221
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:36,025 --> 01:30:39,017
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:40,661
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

671
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:43,163
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,365 --> 01:30:45,128
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,334 --> 01:30:46,733
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:46,935 --> 01:30:49,267
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:52,531
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:54,140
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,343 --> 01:30:56,311
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

678
01:30:56,945 --> 01:30:58,105
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,314 --> 01:31:01,181
-I'm sorry?
-I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:03,085 --> 01:31:05,349
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:07,884
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:10,526 --> 01:31:13,120
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:36,018 --> 01:31:37,178
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,386 --> 01:31:40,184
-Shaken or stirred?
-Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,374 --> 01:32:00,638
-James.
-Get the girl out.

686
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:08,883
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:09,084 --> 01:32:12,178
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:12,921 --> 01:32:16,015
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:18,026 --> 01:32:19,425
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:22,119
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,331 --> 01:32:24,595
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:25,033 --> 01:32:26,967
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,035
No.

694
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:37,311
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:37,513 --> 01:32:40,175
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,343
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:48,421
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,124
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:52,828 --> 01:32:55,388
Does it look like
we need the money?

700
01:33:06,942 --> 01:33:09,035
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,246 --> 01:33:12,941
Why not?

702
01:33:16,418 --> 01:33:17,908
Bet.

703
01:33:19,988 --> 01:33:21,649
Raise.

704
01:33:37,172 --> 01:33:39,106
And fold.

705
01:33:41,343 --> 01:33:43,311
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:45,013 --> 01:33:46,640
Call.

707
01:33:48,116 --> 01:33:49,344
Raise.

708
01:33:49,551 --> 01:33:53,009
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:55,524 --> 01:33:57,458
-Fold.
-Thank you.

710
01:33:59,828 --> 01:34:00,988
Fold.

711
01:34:05,267 --> 01:34:06,791
Fold.

712
01:34:11,707 --> 01:34:13,140
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,342 --> 01:34:14,309
Wins.

714
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,590
Deal me out.

715
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:40,727
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:42,704 --> 01:34:44,262
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:50,770
-Who is it?
-It's 007.

718
01:35:52,441 --> 01:35:55,001
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,179 --> 01:35:59,613
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:35:59,815 --> 01:36:02,443
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:03,911
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:05,643
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

723
01:36:05,854 --> 01:36:08,186
<i>-Do we know what it is yet?
-We're still scanning.</i>

724
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:16,559
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:27,175
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,476 --> 01:36:30,274
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:32,106
<i>...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?</i>

728
01:36:32,314 --> 01:36:35,044
<i>-As soon as it reads charged--
-Lidocaine. That'll work.</i>

729
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,718
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:37,919 --> 01:36:39,352
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:39,554 --> 01:36:41,920
<i>There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.</i>

732
01:36:42,924 --> 01:36:46,792
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:46,995 --> 01:36:49,293
<i>That'll counteract the digitalis.</i>

734
01:36:52,601 --> 01:36:54,398
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

735
01:36:54,603 --> 01:36:56,036
You need to keep
your heart going.

736
01:36:56,238 --> 01:36:57,466
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:03,578 --> 01:37:06,012
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!

738
01:37:53,895 --> 01:37:55,863
-You okay?
-Me?

739
01:37:59,201 --> 01:38:01,795
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

740
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:05,666
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.

741
01:38:06,675 --> 01:38:08,074
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:08,276 --> 01:38:11,006
You're not seriously
going back there?

743
01:38:13,582 --> 01:38:15,482
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:18,711
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:22,457 --> 01:38:24,015
-All in.
-Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,226 --> 01:38:26,820
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,730
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:37,103
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,874
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:47,082 --> 01:38:49,642
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:51,086 --> 01:38:54,681
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,653
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:56,858 --> 01:39:00,055
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

754
01:39:07,135 --> 01:39:08,261
Four players.

755
01:39:11,072 --> 01:39:12,437
It's your bet.

756
01:39:16,478 --> 01:39:17,638
-Monsieur Bond?
-Check.

757
01:39:17,846 --> 01:39:21,680
-Check.
-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:24,553 --> 01:39:26,680
Check. And check.

759
01:39:27,122 --> 01:39:28,714
All check.

760
01:39:29,057 --> 01:39:30,251
Four players.

761
01:39:35,263 --> 01:39:36,662
-Check.
-Check.

762
01:39:42,571 --> 01:39:44,732
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,165
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:53,615 --> 01:39:55,947
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,711
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,228 --> 01:40:07,559
Raise.

767
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,324
Raise.

768
01:40:10,532 --> 01:40:13,797
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:47,527
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:49,971 --> 01:40:51,802
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:10,692 --> 01:41:14,287
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

772
01:41:21,136 --> 01:41:22,330
Call.

773
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:38,413
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:41,350
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:46,927
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:55,503 --> 01:41:58,495
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:16,658 --> 01:42:18,785
A higher full house.

778
01:42:18,994 --> 01:42:20,461
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:26,468 --> 01:42:27,662
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,210
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:47,422 --> 01:42:48,889
A straight flush.

782
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:50,387
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:50,592 --> 01:42:52,685
The high hand.

784
01:42:57,399 --> 01:42:58,923
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:42:59,934 --> 01:43:02,232
-For you.
-Thank you very much.

786
01:43:04,672 --> 01:43:05,866
Congratulations.

787
01:43:06,074 --> 01:43:09,601
-He's all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:16,584 --> 01:43:17,744
Congratulations.

789
01:43:17,952 --> 01:43:19,817
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:22,546
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:23,425 --> 01:43:26,417
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:36,838 --> 01:43:38,703
Thank you.

793
01:43:46,314 --> 01:43:50,216
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:50,418 --> 01:43:53,046
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

795
01:43:53,755 --> 01:43:55,723
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:57,125 --> 01:43:58,922
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:59,127 --> 01:44:03,291
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,994
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:11,728
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:12,073 --> 01:44:16,339
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,208
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:26,654 --> 01:44:28,918
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:29,124 --> 01:44:32,321
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:32,527 --> 01:44:34,154
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:35,063 --> 01:44:36,530
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,235 --> 01:44:41,964
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:48,476 --> 01:44:51,309
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

808
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,874
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:54,482 --> 01:44:57,508
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:58,453 --> 01:45:00,683
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:01,322 --> 01:45:03,483
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:03,691 --> 01:45:05,283
Just because
you've done something...

813
01:45:05,493 --> 01:45:07,620
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:07,829 --> 01:45:10,730
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:12,900
You think I can't take
my own advice?

816
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:16,463
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:17,005 --> 01:45:19,030
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:24,979 --> 01:45:27,106
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:27,782 --> 01:45:29,044
Good night.

820
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:30,581
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:49,871 --> 01:45:51,702
Mathis.

822
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:47,587
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

823
01:47:48,856 --> 01:47:50,653
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:33,428 --> 01:49:36,158
You've taken good care
of your body.

825
01:49:42,703 --> 01:49:45,194
Such a waste.

826
01:50:02,457 --> 01:50:04,288
You know...

827
01:50:04,659 --> 01:50:07,787
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:50:07,995 --> 01:50:10,190
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:50:10,398 --> 01:50:13,925
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:15,436 --> 01:50:16,596
And of course...

831
01:50:16,804 --> 01:50:19,773
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:19,974 --> 01:50:22,636
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:23,344 --> 01:50:26,973
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:33,054 --> 01:50:34,954
The only question remains...

835
01:50:36,457 --> 01:50:38,618
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:40,695 --> 01:50:43,823
I want the money.

837
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:05,986
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:51:06,187 --> 01:51:08,553
So all I need from you
is the password.

839
01:51:18,332 --> 01:51:21,563
The password, please.

840
01:51:25,806 --> 01:51:28,104
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:28,309 --> 01:51:30,174
...down there.

842
01:51:30,945 --> 01:51:32,412
Would you mind?

843
01:51:40,154 --> 01:51:43,555
No! No! No!

844
01:51:44,525 --> 01:51:48,222
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:48,429 --> 01:51:50,863
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,290
Yeah!

847
01:51:55,536 --> 01:51:58,835
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:52:04,512 --> 01:52:09,950
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:52:11,252 --> 01:52:13,243
I died?

850
01:52:13,454 --> 01:52:14,751
-I died?
-Yes.

851
01:52:14,956 --> 01:52:17,925
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:18,125 --> 01:52:19,956
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:20,161 --> 01:52:22,994
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:23,197 --> 01:52:24,596
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:24,799 --> 01:52:26,858
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:27,068 --> 01:52:29,866
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:30,071 --> 01:52:33,063
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:33,274 --> 01:52:36,072
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:37,612 --> 01:52:41,241
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:42,483 --> 01:52:44,542
The big picture.

861
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:54,690
Give me the password...

862
01:52:54,895 --> 01:52:56,829
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:03,595
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:16,684 --> 01:53:18,811
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,817
No.

866
01:53:22,657 --> 01:53:24,557
So I think...

867
01:53:29,096 --> 01:53:32,532
...l'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:47,944
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:48,849 --> 01:53:51,340
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:51,552 --> 01:53:56,012
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:19,647 --> 01:54:21,046
Francesco.

872
01:54:21,982 --> 01:54:23,882
Francesco.

873
01:54:36,597 --> 01:54:38,724
Vesper.

874
01:54:40,601 --> 01:54:42,501
Vesper.

875
01:54:44,638 --> 01:54:46,162
No.

876
01:54:46,974 --> 01:54:48,305
Not him.

877
01:54:48,509 --> 01:54:50,409
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:52,246 --> 01:54:53,406
No.

879
01:54:54,248 --> 01:54:56,273
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:59,053 --> 01:55:00,850
Not him.

881
01:55:02,757 --> 01:55:03,917
Any ideas?

882
01:55:07,661 --> 01:55:11,495
-What?
-Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:13,501 --> 01:55:14,934
Where is she?

884
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:17,870
Sleeping.

885
01:55:18,472 --> 01:55:21,737
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:22,843 --> 01:55:24,504
It's just odd...

887
01:55:24,712 --> 01:55:28,614
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:28,816 --> 01:55:32,149
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:35,447
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:37,719
No.

891
01:55:39,193 --> 01:55:40,626
Shame.

892
01:55:42,296 --> 01:55:44,025
Drink up.

893
01:55:47,434 --> 01:55:49,595
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:49,804 --> 01:55:51,829
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:52,039 --> 01:55:53,666
Help us?

896
01:55:53,874 --> 01:55:56,104
Or help you?

897
01:56:36,483 --> 01:56:37,643
Hello.

898
01:56:37,852 --> 01:56:39,683
Hello.

899
01:56:41,388 --> 01:56:42,685
You all right?

900
01:56:43,324 --> 01:56:45,485
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:45,693 --> 01:56:50,323
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:51,465 --> 01:56:53,456
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:57,204 --> 01:57:00,298
If you'd just been born...

904
01:57:00,975 --> 01:57:03,239
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:57:04,011 --> 01:57:06,206
You have me there.

906
01:57:08,883 --> 01:57:11,579
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:13,654 --> 01:57:15,178
I can?

908
01:57:15,389 --> 01:57:19,257
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:20,261 --> 01:57:23,162
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:23,364 --> 01:57:25,559
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:25,766 --> 01:57:27,199
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:27,401 --> 01:57:31,269
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as....

913
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:35,368
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:35,943 --> 01:57:38,844
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:41,871
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:44,652 --> 01:57:48,281
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:49,723 --> 01:57:52,453
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,651
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:54,862 --> 01:57:56,853
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:57,064 --> 01:57:59,897
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:02,227
I'm afraid not.

922
01:58:03,437 --> 01:58:06,304
If you would type in
the account number.

923
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:14,779
And now the password.

924
01:58:15,582 --> 01:58:16,742
You can do that.

925
01:58:17,451 --> 01:58:19,510
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:26,491
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:37,338 --> 01:58:39,135
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:42,207
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:44,044 --> 01:58:47,275
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:53,854 --> 01:58:55,253
You know, James...

931
01:58:57,858 --> 01:59:00,759
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:59:00,961 --> 01:59:04,260
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:59:04,465 --> 01:59:07,195
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:20,273
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:23,150 --> 01:59:27,018
-I have no idea.
-But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:30,290 --> 01:59:34,226
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:34,962 --> 01:59:37,089
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:37,297 --> 01:59:38,525
That's that.

939
01:59:40,034 --> 01:59:42,594
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:43,837 --> 01:59:46,328
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:47,207 --> 01:59:49,675
Whatever is left of me....

942
01:59:50,144 --> 01:59:53,011
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:53,847 --> 01:59:55,815
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:56,016 --> 01:59:58,507
...l'm yours.

945
02:00:59,947 --> 02:01:02,939
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

946
02:01:03,684 --> 02:01:05,515
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:06,913
Mathis?

948
02:01:07,121 --> 02:01:09,146
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:01:09,356 --> 02:01:11,790
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:13,917
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:14,128 --> 02:01:17,791
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:17,998 --> 02:01:20,193
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,992
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:22,469 --> 02:01:24,869
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:25,539 --> 02:01:27,336
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:28,742 --> 02:01:31,142
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:34,809
Yes.

958
02:01:37,751 --> 02:01:39,514
Everyone.

959
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,751
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:46,226 --> 02:01:48,251
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:50,297 --> 02:01:52,231
You love me?

962
02:01:52,766 --> 02:01:55,030
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

963
02:01:55,235 --> 02:01:57,430
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

964
02:01:58,071 --> 02:02:02,132
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:02:03,043 --> 02:02:04,476
You're serious.

966
02:02:05,445 --> 02:02:07,345
Like you said...

967
02:02:07,915 --> 02:02:09,610
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:02:09,816 --> 02:02:12,614
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

969
02:02:12,819 --> 02:02:15,686
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

970
02:02:17,691 --> 02:02:19,784
Is that enough for you?

971
02:04:04,131 --> 02:04:06,031
-Come on.
-No. No.

972
02:04:06,533 --> 02:04:09,730
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

973
02:04:09,936 --> 02:04:12,131
What's the time?

974
02:04:14,374 --> 02:04:16,433
How much do we need
to float for a month?

975
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:18,673
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:18,879 --> 02:04:22,815
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:25,752 --> 02:04:28,084
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:31,451
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:31,658 --> 02:04:34,388
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:39,166 --> 02:04:42,533
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

981
02:04:51,244 --> 02:04:53,144
Though apparently not
your employer.

982
02:04:57,584 --> 02:05:00,815
Back in one month.

983
02:05:01,888 --> 02:05:04,288
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:05:04,491 --> 02:05:06,652
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:36,323 --> 02:05:38,757
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

986
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:05,684
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.

987
02:06:05,886 --> 02:06:07,547
<i>Yes?</i>

988
02:06:07,754 --> 02:06:09,585
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:06:09,790 --> 02:06:12,782
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

990
02:06:12,993 --> 02:06:15,553
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:19,266 --> 02:06:22,099
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:22,302 --> 02:06:25,601
<i>Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.</i>

993
02:06:25,806 --> 02:06:27,967
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:28,308 --> 02:06:30,936
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:31,344 --> 02:06:34,040
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:34,514 --> 02:06:35,674
<i>Hello.</i>

997
02:06:35,882 --> 02:06:39,283
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

998
02:06:39,486 --> 02:06:41,317
It was transferred
to the account number...

999
02:06:41,521 --> 02:06:43,819
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1000
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:49,861
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1001
02:06:52,566 --> 02:06:54,397
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.

1002
02:06:54,601 --> 02:06:55,829
St. Mark's Square.

1003
02:06:58,205 --> 02:06:59,900
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?</i>

1004
02:09:12,606 --> 02:09:13,766
I'll kill her!

1005
02:09:14,774 --> 02:09:15,968
Allow me.

1006
02:13:35,902 --> 02:13:37,870
I'm sorry, James.

1007
02:16:49,529 --> 02:16:52,259
<i>She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.</i>

1008
02:16:52,465 --> 02:16:54,524
<i>They were very much in love.</i>

1009
02:16:54,934 --> 02:16:58,062
<i>He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.</i>

1010
02:16:58,271 --> 02:17:03,231
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1011
02:17:03,443 --> 02:17:04,808
We should've picked up on it...

1012
02:17:05,011 --> 02:17:07,241
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1013
02:17:07,447 --> 02:17:08,971
...we forget to watch our friends.

1014
02:17:10,616 --> 02:17:12,481
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1015
02:17:12,819 --> 02:17:15,049
She left her cell phone.

1016
02:17:15,254 --> 02:17:17,620
She must have known I'd check it.

1017
02:17:18,424 --> 02:17:20,585
She knew you were you.

1018
02:17:21,661 --> 02:17:23,891
<i>-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.</i>

1019
02:17:24,097 --> 02:17:25,724
-No?
-No.

1020
02:17:25,932 --> 02:17:28,423
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1021
02:17:28,634 --> 02:17:30,966
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1022
02:17:31,771 --> 02:17:33,534
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

1023
02:17:33,739 --> 02:17:35,366
<i>No.</i>

1024
02:17:35,875 --> 02:17:38,139
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1025
02:17:38,945 --> 02:17:41,140
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1026
02:17:41,881 --> 02:17:43,041
Will do.

1027
02:17:45,318 --> 02:17:46,683
If you do need time....

1028
02:17:46,886 --> 02:17:48,148
<i>Why should I need more time?</i>

1029
02:17:49,288 --> 02:17:52,553
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1030
02:17:53,493 --> 02:17:55,290
James...

1031
02:17:55,928 --> 02:17:59,329
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1032
02:17:59,932 --> 02:18:01,627
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1033
02:18:01,834 --> 02:18:05,793
<i>She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.</i>

1034
02:18:06,005 --> 02:18:08,166
<i>I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.</i>

1035
02:18:09,742 --> 02:18:12,734
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1036
02:18:13,846 --> 02:18:16,781
<i>And now we'll never know
who was behind this.</i>

1037
02:18:16,983 --> 02:18:19,543
<i>The trail's gone cold.</i>

1038
02:19:47,073 --> 02:19:48,973
<i>-Hello.
-Mr. White?</i>

1039
02:19:49,175 --> 02:19:50,665
<i>We need to talk.</i>

1040
02:19:50,876 --> 02:19:52,741
Who is this?

1041
02:20:23,042 --> 02:20:25,033
The name's Bond.

1042
02:20:25,244 --> 02:20:27,178
James Bond.
