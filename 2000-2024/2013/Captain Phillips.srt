1
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,890
Okay.

2
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,863
You all right?

3
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,403
Yeah.

4
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,872
You'd think these trips would
get easier, but it's just the opposite.

5
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,340
Well, I feel the same
way, Ange.

6
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,759
I know this is what we do.
This is our life.

7
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,596
But it just seems like the world
is moving so fast,

8
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,515
and right now
things are changing so much.

9
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,601
They sure are.

10
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,986
I'll tell you something.
It's not gonna be easy for our kids.

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,865
They're going into a different world
than the one you and I came into.

12
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,537
Yeah.

13
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,911
You know,
both our kids are doing great.

14
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,915
But it worries me when Danny
doesn't take school seriously.

15
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,464
Him missing class.
That could come out--

16
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:48,002
it might hurt him when he's out
looking for a job, you know?

17
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,047
The competition out there.
When I was starting out,

18
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,888
you could make captain if you put
your head down and did your work.

19
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,768
But young guys coming up now...

20
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,096
Companies want things faster
and cheaper.

21
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,015
And 50 guys compete
for every job.

22
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,565
Everything's different,
and big wheels are turning.

23
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,946
You gotta be strong
to survive out there.

24
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,652
Mm.

25
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,402
I hear what you're saying.

26
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,866
It's gonna be okay, right?

27
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,076
Oh, yeah.

28
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,660
Gonna be okay.

29
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,924
<i>This is a
special security announcement.</i>

30
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,469
<i>Please maintain control
of your personal belongings at all times.</i>

31
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:44,187
<i>Unattended baggage is subject
to search, inspection and removal.</i>

32
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,646
I love you.
Love you too.

33
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,026
Have a safe trip.
I'll call you from there.

34
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,032
They're here!

35
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,826
Hurry, Muse!

36
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,932
What the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you out on the water?

37
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,938
You know what you're supposed to do!

38
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,107
You should be out there
earning money!

39
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,818
But we caught a ship last week.

40
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,948
That was last week!

41
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,527
The boss wants money today!

42
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,242
Bring Garaad
another ship soon

43
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,122
or you will answer for it!

44
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,622
Everybody, get back
to work now!

45
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,881
Stay out of my way today.

46
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,761
Hufan!

47
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,022
I'm going to get us something big!

48
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,060
Those who want
to make money, come.

49
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,439
Muse, take me with you.

50
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
Does your
sister know you're here?

51
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,946
She's selling khat up there.

52
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,988
This is her best stuff.

53
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,002
When we get a big ship,
you will be well paid.

54
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,879
You want to work?

55
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,169
Do you know how to steer a boat?

56
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,554
Go, go.

57
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,222
I'm ready.

58
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,054
What do you have for me?
Money.

59
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,470
When are you gonna give it to me?
As soon as we're paid.

60
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,106
Spread out!

61
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,737
Let my other man choose his crew.

62
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,691
Next time bring me
something if you want to work.

63
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,709
Come on, Bilal.

64
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,343
Hey, Skinny, I can steer your boat.

65
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,629
If you choose me, you won't regret it.

66
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,925
Okay, Elmi.

67
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,022
I need somebody strong.

68
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,147
Somebody like this?

69
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,280
I want him.

70
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,121
Get out of my way!

71
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,038
Why did he pick him?

72
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,458
He's from another village.

73
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,926
Move!

74
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,062
Faster, move faster!

75
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,072
See if you can get more power.

76
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,238
Okay.

77
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,948
You!

78
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,615
Get over here!

79
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,579
Come help us!

80
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,604
Okay, pull it in!

81
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,109
Sign right there, sir.

82
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,811
You have a good day.

83
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,898
Hello, Cap. Let me get that for you.
Morning.

84
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,163
<i>Attention, all crew. All crew.</i>

85
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,121
<i>1500 departure three out.</i>

86
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,716
Hey, good to see you, Cap.
Shane. Good to see you.

87
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,385
Good to see you.
Hey. Carry on.

88
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,848
- Hey, bos?
- Yeah?

89
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,929
Get on that safety rail, huh?

90
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,310
- Kenny.
- Yeah?

91
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,314
I want you to go down to the deck office,
grab Jimmy, get on the Lodestar.

92
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,526
Mm-hm.
That ballast, move it five points.

93
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,737
Take care of that now.
You got it.

94
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,243
How's the family, Cap?

95
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,200
Oh, you know.

96
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,208
Andrea's a champ, one kid gone,
another kid going.

97
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,618
How are the boxes?

98
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,879
Oh, you know. Just putting
a few last containers on.

99
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,209
Twenty-four hundred tons of
commercial cargo, 200 tons of food aid,

100
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:54,514
166 tons of freshwater,
250 metric tons of fuel bunkered.

101
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,016
Walk me through the plan.

102
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,312
So here we are in Salalah.

103
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,517
Travel down the coalition corridor
to Djibouti.

104
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,980
Then we exit the shipping lane

105
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,111
south of Socotra.

106
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,022
Socotra, okay.

107
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:15,615
Then we're on our own down
the coast through the Somali Basin,

108
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,912
all the way down to Mombasa.

109
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,199
<i>We need five
minutes on that reefer bow.</i>

110
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,921
We should be able
to unload the containers around 0800.

111
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,168
Well, let's tighten up security.

112
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,178
We are going
around the Horn of Africa, right?

113
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,433
We got pirate cages. They were
all open. All the doors are unlocked.

114
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,265
I want everything closed, locked,
even in port.

115
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,974
Right.
Fine. Ready to leave. 1500.

116
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,188
Absolutely, Cap. You got it.

117
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,114
Stow the gangway.

118
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,494
Last lines in.

119
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,906
Okay. Lower it.

120
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,373
Sixteen-B ready. Take it up.

121
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,669
Tighten it up.

122
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,831
Hey, slow down.

123
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,920
Bow clear.

124
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,303
Stern lines are clear.

125
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,222
Bow thruster full starboard.

126
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,805
Bow thruster on.

127
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,310
All lines clear. Ship is under way.

128
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,197
Dead slow ahead.
Dead slow ahead.

129
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,004
Keep those hatches locked down.

130
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,457
Cap.
Morning.

131
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,146
Check that rigging.

132
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,245
- Shane.
- Yeah?

133
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,872
We need those time sheets.

134
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,076
She's winking at me.
But it turns out that's what they do.

135
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,581
I'll show you this place.
I'll take you.

136
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,872
I'll have two beers
and a bucketful of sin, please.

137
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,626
Yeah. About done with that coffee?

138
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,213
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're done.

139
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,466
That's 15, guys.

140
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,968
Back to work. Come on, let's go.

141
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,014
- Jesus.
- See you down there, Mike.

142
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,998
Their main route
is packed with ships

143
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,161
but we can't attack a herd.

144
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,720
This one is alone.

145
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,068
<i>♪ She puts on her makeup ♪</i>

146
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,325
<i>♪ And brushes her long blonde hair ♪</i>

147
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:37,169
<i>♪ And then she asks me,
"Do I look all right?" ♪</i>

148
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:45,010
<i>♪ And I say,
"Yes, you look wonderful tonight" ♪♪</i>

149
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,397
Morning.

150
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,152
Hey, Cap.

151
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,908
Cap. Morning, Cap.

152
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,788
Shane, I want to do some security drills,
unannounced.

153
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,448
Starting now.

154
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,037
Uh, what?
Fire, man overboard?

155
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,794
Everything.
Ken, you're the duty officer?

156
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,421
Yeah, Cap. Right.

157
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,129
Boat with two armed men is approaching
on your starboard beam.

158
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,007
- No, no. Whistle first.
- Let's go.

159
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,758
That way the pirates know we're aware of
them and are ready to defend the ship.

160
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,642
Hustle up. Let's go.

161
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,187
Attention, all crew.

162
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,566
<i>All crew.
All men to your stations on deck.</i>

163
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,319
Repeat,
all men to your deck stations now.

164
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,363
Let's do this.

165
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,745
Come on-- Get those keys off your hip.
Put them in your pocket. Come on, guys.

166
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,079
Pirates capture you
and find those keys,

167
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,836
they'll have access to every door
on this ship.

168
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,546
Get those hoses on.

169
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,432
Bring it around, bring around,
bring around.

170
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,344
- Watch it, man.
- Ready with number six.

171
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,636
All right.

172
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,396
You tied up?

173
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,108
All done here, Shane.

174
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,358
Hey, Cap, this is Shane. Do you read?
Yeah, Shane, go ahead.

175
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,195
Things are looking good down here.
We're getting close with the hoses.

176
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,410
All right. Let me know
when you're ready down there.

177
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,037
<i>Copy that.</i>

178
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,551
Shane, come up to the bridge.

179
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,682
Okay.

180
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,746
What's up, Cap? Everything okay?

181
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,127
I don't like the look of that.

182
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,555
Yeah, Cap.
Chief, I want all your guys on station.

183
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,554
Still in the drill?

184
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,016
This is real-world. Someone coming up
on our starboard quarter.

185
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,896
Got it.

186
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,607
Port, 5 degrees.
Let's see if they follow us.

187
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,816
Port, 5.

188
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,378
Get the crew back
to their muster stations.

189
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,050
Right.

190
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,547
Attention, all crew.
Return to your muster stations.

191
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,717
<i>Repeat, return to your muster stations.</i>

192
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,603
This is not a drill.
This is a real-world situation.

193
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,808
Yeah, Cap.
I want to come up to 122.

194
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,227
Second mate and helmsman
to the bridge.

195
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,821
You're good. Bring her on up.

196
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,835
Now get me U.S. Maritime Emergency.

197
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,467
Two skiffs.
Can't tell how many they're carrying.

198
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,718
Copy that.

199
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,760
There's no answer
at the U.S. Maritime Emergency line.

200
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,144
Raise the UKMTO.
Right.

201
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,429
What's up?

202
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,349
We got two skiffs approaching.
Get on the radar.

203
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,399
Yeah, this is the <i>Maersk Alabama.</i>
Here's the captain.

204
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,443
UKMTO.

205
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,362
- Operations?
<i>- Receiving.</i>

206
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,996
<i>This is the Maersk Alabama.</i>

207
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:26,082
<i>Our position is 2 degrees 2 north
by 49 degrees 19 east.</i>

208
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,588
<i>Our course is 180.
Our speed is 17 knots.</i>

209
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,672
We have two skiffs approaching
at a distance of 1.5 miles

210
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,962
with a possible mothership following.

211
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,802
<i>- Potential piracy situation.
- Copy, Alabama.</i>

212
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,763
Alert your crew,
get your fire hoses ready

213
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,054
<i>and follow lockdown procedures.</i>

214
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,440
Uh-- Yeah. Is that it?

215
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,398
I'm relaying your transmission now,
but chances are it's just fishermen.

216
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,437
They're not here to fish.

217
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,715
She's really big! Get ready!

218
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,222
You worry about yourself,
skinny rat!

219
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,563
Both skiffs carrying armed men.

220
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,605
Distance?
One and a quarter miles and closing.

221
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,070
Yeah, Cap.
I wanna bring it up to 125.

222
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,575
You're still good.
One twenty-five.

223
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,058
Brothers, we're going
to make a lot of money!

224
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,181
Slow down! The waves are too big!

225
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,522
They're at one mile now, Cap.
Only one mile.

226
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,788
<i>Coalition Warship 237,
this is Maersk Alabama.</i>

227
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,340
<i>Coalition Warship 237,
Maersk Alabama.</i>

228
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,886
Go, Alabama.

229
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,808
Our position is 2
degrees 2 north by 49 degrees 19 east.

230
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:51,393
<i>Our course is 180.
Our speed is 18.5 knots.</i>

231
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,855
<i>We are being approached
by two pirate skiffs</i>

232
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,611
<i>with a possible mothership following.</i>

233
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,444
<i>We require immediate assistance.</i>

234
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,616
We have a crew of 20.

235
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:07,576
<i>We are preparing our weapons now
but request air support if possible.</i>

236
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,702
Copy?

237
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,754
Copy, Alabama.

238
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:21,010
Be aware, a gunship is in the air.
ETA your position, five minutes.

239
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,762
Five minutes. Thank you, 237.

240
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,312
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

241
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,316
We've got to get out of here!

242
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,948
Turn back, turn back!

243
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,531
What are you doing?

244
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,447
Where are you going?

245
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,826
Come on! Keep going!

246
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,461
Yeah, we got one down.

247
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,965
But the other one's still coming.
Half a mile out.

248
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,095
We need to make a bigger wake.

249
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,758
Yeah.
Cancel the limits. One two nine.

250
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,896
Yeah, you're on the edge
with Cylinder Number 5.

251
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,398
Do it.

252
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,352
- Port, 5 degrees.
- Port, 5 degrees.

253
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,124
Faster, faster!

254
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,544
They're at a quarter mile now.

255
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,544
- Starboard, 5 degrees.
- Starboard, 5 degrees.

256
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,591
Hurry, hurry! Go!

257
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,343
We're pushing
this engine too hard!

258
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,279
Faster, faster!

259
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,351
Come on, let's go!

260
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,102
This thing is busted.

261
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,688
Then fix it!
I'm trying!

262
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,474
They're not messing around.
Lit us up from miles away.

263
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,976
Must've been tracking us.

264
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,479
Why doesn't the company
give us armed guards?

265
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,389
Move it in.
The captain's here.

266
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,271
Blips on the radar that are
clocking at 27 knots.

267
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,936
They were moving.
We cannot outrun these guys.

268
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:31,200
Obviously, we all just went
through a dangerous situation.

269
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,663
Two skiffs, both with armed intruders.

270
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:40,543
Now, we all know that's a hazard
in these waters, but you performed well.

271
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,919
The ship performed well.

272
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,622
The authorities
have been made aware

273
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,383
so I think we have the situation
well in hand.

274
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,091
From now on,
we just follow our normal duties.

275
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,381
Mate, what do you got?

276
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,427
Yeah. We're all on double shifts
until we make it through these waters.

277
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,813
All right. Chief, can you keep
your engineers on roster?

278
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,440
We'll keep a guy in the ECR
around the clock.

279
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,940
All right. Enjoy your coffee.

280
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,479
Cap.

281
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,648
They're coming back.

282
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,534
Amen. Yeah, that's right.
They're coming back.

283
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:19,206
If they come back, we'll follow procedure.
They worked today, they'll work again.

284
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,710
We got the speed, we got the height,
we got hoses that can sink those skiffs.

285
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,794
We will follow the procedures even if
we have to shut down, lock down,

286
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,754
go dead in the water
and wait for help.

287
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,470
Now, wait. I'm a u--
Okay, I'm a union guy, okay?

288
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,131
Twenty-five years, all right?

289
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,139
I'm telling you now that they're
not paying me enough to fight pirates.

290
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,225
You all signed up for a route
around the Horn of Africa.

291
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,857
What did you expect?
I didn't sign up for the Navy over here.

292
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,643
You signed up for the route.

293
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,311
- For a cargo ship.
- What did you expect?

294
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,947
Not getting
attacked without weapons.

295
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,699
Why don't we get out of here?
Put room between us.

296
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,781
Go where?
In eight hours,

297
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,323
- we could be a hundred miles from here.
- Hundred to a 150.

298
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,208
There's five pirate bands
in this part of the world.

299
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,917
You go out 300 miles, you run into one,
go 6, you run into another.

300
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,629
Our job ¡s to move the cargo as
fast as possible. That's the job.

301
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,544
If anybody doesn't like it,
if anybody wants off,

302
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,927
if anybody doesn't like this route

303
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,806
between Salalah, Djibouti
and Mombasa,

304
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,139
come to my office and
sign the paperwork per the union,

305
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,976
and you'll be on the first flight home
out of Mombasa.

306
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,943
Enjoy your coffee.
Let's get back to work.

307
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,151
Go get those guys
squared away, will you?

308
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,494
The ocean was rough.
Really rough.

309
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,623
Hufan, I'm telling you,
our boat couldn't take it.

310
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,500
Nothing was working for us.

311
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,837
Hurry up.

312
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,666
We need a bigger one for that ship.

313
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,551
I want this welded by the morning

314
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,087
by tomorrow, got it?

315
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,179
Elmi.

316
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,436
When will that engine be ready?

317
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,687
We've gotta fix it.

318
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,520
This thing is old and weak.

319
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,275
It's a piece of shit.

320
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:57,569
Shut up and fix it
for your crew of women.

321
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,447
Why don't you give me your engine?

322
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:10,286
Shut up, Skinny. You talk too much.

323
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,751
I may be skinny, but I'm not a coward.

324
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,006
What did you say?

325
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,808
Say it again!

326
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,104
You think you're somebody?

327
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,854
Say it again!

328
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:55,752
The coward is the first
one in the grave.

329
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,458
<i>Captain, this is Shane.</i>

330
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,664
Yeah, go ahead.

331
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,879
<i>I think you better get up here.</i>

332
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,002
Corning.

333
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,844
Where are they?
Port quarter.

334
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,729
One-point-seven miles, captain.

335
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,393
Guy's coming on his own.

336
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,403
Sound the alarm.

337
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,532
Get U.S. Maritime
Emergency for me.

338
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,082
Muster stations. This is not a drill.
Everyone to muster stations.

339
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,417
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
Come on.

340
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,172
Shit.

341
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,676
Come on. Let's go. Go.

342
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,971
Yeah, Cap.
They're coming back.

343
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,257
I want max revs. Take the limits off.

344
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,801
Copy that. Canceling all limits.

345
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,766
Five degrees starboard.
Starboard, 5 degrees.

346
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,820
Get ready.

347
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,043
U.S. Maritime Emergency line.

348
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,673
<i>This is the Maersk Alabama.
We are under pirate attack at a...</i>

349
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,584
- What's happening?
- Ken, get out here.

350
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,797
I need eyes on the wing. Skiff coming in.
I'm on it.

351
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:12,389
Our course is 166.
Our speed is 19 knots.

352
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,516
Copy that, Alabama.
Relaying to military channels now.

353
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,647
Copy that.

354
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,184
They're coming in fast, Cap.

355
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,816
Alabama.

356
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,110
Alabama <i>ship.</i>

357
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,868
Somali coast guard.
This is a routine check.

358
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,911
Stop your ship now.

359
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:37,076
<i>We are coming aboard.
We're here to help you.</i>

360
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,711
Shane, they're dead astern.
Jesus Christ.

361
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,838
Yeah, Cap.
We're gonna need the hoses.

362
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,044
Yeah, your pumps are good.

363
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,179
- Count it down for me, Shane.
- Yeah. They're at 800 yards.

364
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,477
- Prepare for hard turns.
- Stop now!

365
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,761
Standing by.

366
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,478
Alabama, this is your final warning.

367
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,017
Stop the ship.

368
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,317
They're not stopping.

369
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,986
Show them who we are, Muse.

370
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,908
Shoot at them!

371
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,078
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Hit the hoses.

372
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,258
Turn!

373
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,897
Coming in close, Cap.

374
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,248
Shane! Hose seven has slipped.

375
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,450
Bay 17.
I'm on it. Shit.

376
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,791
Be careful.
I'm on Channel 3.

377
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,711
It's clear over there!

378
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,721
They're coming back in.

379
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,612
Untie the ladder.

380
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,753
Give me the other one.

381
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,345
Shoot him!

382
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,524
Let's go, let's go!

383
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,652
Hurry up, Bilal.

384
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,862
Move your ass, kid.

385
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,253
Channel 3. Shane, get out of there.

386
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,543
<i>Get everybody down
to the engine room.</i>

387
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,803
I need you in command there.

388
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,849
Stop him!

389
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,274
All crew! All crew!

390
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,355
All crew to the engine room!
All crew to the engine room now!

391
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,274
Come on, let's go. Move it.

392
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:56,904
Come on, men.

393
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,583
Higher. Get it higher.

394
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,878
- Port, 30 degrees.
- Port, 30 degrees.

395
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,011
Hook it on!

396
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,654
They got the ladder up.
Starboard, 30 degrees.

397
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,356
Starboard, 30 degrees.

398
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,825
Get out of my way.

399
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,800
- Port, 30 degrees.
- Port, 30 degrees.

400
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,891
Starboard, 30 degrees.
Starboard, 30.

401
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,280
Someone's shooting at us.

402
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,074
Hang on.
Just get together against the wall.

403
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,581
- Cronan. Cronan.
- Yeah.

404
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,212
Hold them by the door.
We'll get a head count.

405
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,714
Go down to the door.

406
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,458
- Mike?
- Yeah.

407
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,877
How long till you can shut her down?
Five minutes.

408
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:39,719
How long till you can shut her down?
Five minutes.

409
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,321
Four pirates on board.

410
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,908
<i>Four pirates, coming
towards us down the main deck.</i>

411
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,617
- Lock down the bridge.
- Yeah.

412
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,330
Listen up. We have been
boarded by four armed pirates.

413
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,832
You know the drill.

414
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,500
<i>We stay hidden no matter what.
I don't want any hostages.</i>

415
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,719
We stay locked down
until help arrives.

416
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:30,479
No one comes out until you hear
the nonduress password, "suppertime."

417
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,856
Jesus.

418
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,311
If the pirates find you, remember,
you know the ship.

419
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,526
They don't.
Make them feel like they're in charge

420
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,363
but keep them away from the generator
and the engine controls.

421
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,916
Stick together,

422
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,206
and we'll be all right.

423
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,292
Good luck.

424
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,209
Take everybody to the
bottom of the engine room.

425
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,219
Hide them behind the cylinders.

426
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,006
Try to split them
into groups of threes and fours.

427
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,650
Hey! Don't move! Don't move!

428
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:26,943
Okay, okay.

429
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,030
Don't move, I said! Don't move!
All right. All right.

430
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,615
Okay.

431
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,163
Okay. All right. Okay.

432
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,872
Don't move! We have four!

433
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,209
- All right, all right.
- Don't move! We have four! Four!

434
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,254
No, no.

435
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,213
Get away. Get over there.

436
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,521
Captain.

437
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,143
Relax. Nobody get hurt.

438
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,065
No al Qaeda here.

439
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,736
Just business.
We want money.

440
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,904
When we get paid,
everything gonna be okay.

441
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,328
The ship.

442
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,083
Where from?

443
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,879
The ship? Uh, America.
It's an American ship.

444
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,666
America? Ha-ha-ha. Yes! Yes!

445
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,928
You?

446
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,263
Yankee?

447
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,676
Me? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yankee-Irish. Yeah.

448
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,771
From now on this
one is called Irish, okay?

449
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,351
Irish. Irish.

450
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,196
Okay, Irish. What else you carrying?

451
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,401
What do you mean?

452
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,199
TV? Car?

453
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,860
TV and car--? No, no.
We just got the food--

454
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,121
Dollars?
Uh...

455
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,909
We do. Kenny?
Kenny, what do we have in the safe?

456
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:01,330
- We got like, what, $30,000 in the safe?
- Uh... Uh...

457
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:06,669
Yeah, we got like-- We have--
In the safe, we got $30,000.

458
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,256
It's yours.

459
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,013
Thirty thousand dollars?

460
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,221
What am I?
Do I look like a beggar?

461
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,394
What's that?

462
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,441
It's all right.

463
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,948
Hey, calm down! Calm down.

464
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,235
Get back there.

465
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,198
Yeah, yeah, over here.

466
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,824
We got a problem.

467
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,789
We pushed the ship too hard.
We're off the grid.

468
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,421
That means
the computer's now off-line.

469
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,048
Captain. Captain.
The ship's broken.

470
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,632
No one get hurt
if you don't play no game.

471
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,674
Uh-- it's-- The ship's broken.
We had to go--

472
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,518
Nobody gets hurt. Easy.
Hey!

473
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,185
Look at me.
Sure.

474
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,482
Look at me.
Sure.

475
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,234
I'm the captain now.

476
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,988
Watch this ugly one.

477
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,371
What are you doing?

478
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,752
I'm going to fix it.

479
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,916
Do you know how?

480
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,672
Hold the gun on him.

481
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,424
I've got him, don't worry.

482
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,056
Don't mess with anything
you don't know.

483
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,262
Come on, man.

484
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,811
What are you doing?
Just take care of that guy.

485
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,394
Stop the games.

486
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,152
Where is the crew?

487
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,859
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm here with you.

488
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:59,247
Where is your crew?
I don't know. Here, I'll call them up.

489
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,533
I'll get them up here,
all right?

490
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,369
This is the captain speaking.

491
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:08,172
The pirates demand all crew members
to the bridge. All--

492
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,385
Every crew,

493
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:18,057
<i>one minute, I will kill someone.
One minute.</i>

494
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,181
Another minute, I kill somebody.

495
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,231
<i>I kill all your friends.
One minute.</i>

496
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,483
<i>I will no call again.</i>

497
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,281
Get that one and
put him against the wall.

498
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,699
I'm trying--
 You think we playing?

499
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,281
No, I'm doing the best--
No play. No play.

500
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,615
I'm doing the best I can.
Easy, I kill you. Easy.

501
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,710
No, no. Look.
You don't have to do that.

502
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,583
- Come on.
-  You play? You play?

503
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,498
Take it easy, take it easy.
No, no, no.

504
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,417
No, look, look.
Stop play!

505
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,508
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.
You're gonna shoot somebody, shoot me.

506
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,641
Where is the crew, Irish?
Forty seconds!

507
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,847
I don't know. I'm here with you.

508
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,228
No.
Where is the crew?

509
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,639
I see nobody.

510
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,854
I'm the captain. I'm the captain.
Thirty second!

511
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,735
If you're gonna shoot somebody,
you shoot me.

512
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,612
- You killing him.
- It's my ship.

513
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,815
Listen to me.
You killing him.

514
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,326
I'm the captain.
I'm the captain, not them.

515
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,407
- Twenty second!
- This is between us.

516
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:25,416
I'm trying to straighten this out. Are you?
This is how you solve your problems?

517
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,622
You said you just wanted money.

518
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,379
You said this was just business.
Is this business?

519
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,082
- Is this how you do business?
- Ten seconds.

520
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,626
Die right now.

521
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,145
Wait.

522
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,025
I want to search the ship.

523
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,566
You wanna search the ship?

524
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:03,955
I want to search every lock and hold
of the ship now.

525
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,786
You wanna search the ship?
Now.

526
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,996
All right. We'll search the ship.

527
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,787
We'll start on the nav deck
and work our way down.

528
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,331
<i>We better hope the
emergency power stays on.</i>

529
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,502
<i>We won't be able to see if it goes off.
I'll take you. We'll search the ship.</i>

530
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,678
But you stop threatening my men.

531
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,884
No game.

532
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,391
No game.
Let's go.

533
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,518
All right? All right, good.

534
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,187
Take his radio.

535
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,701
All right. Okay.

536
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,699
Go.

537
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,909
Gotta get these lights off.
They're gonna see us.

538
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,875
We need to shut down the generator
on the main deck.

539
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,039
You think you can get up there?
Yeah.

540
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,922
I'm gonna go to the mess, get water.
Get everyone on the lower level.

541
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,883
All right. I'm on 2.

542
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,268
Just start at the very top.

543
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,812
This is E deck.

544
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,354
And we'll just work our way down
one by one, huh?

545
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,178
Cargo hold is probably where they are.
There's a lot of places to hide.

546
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,009
And I'm not trying to trick you.

547
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,425
I wanna find these guys
just as much as you do.

548
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,428
Take his flashlight.

549
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,185
We should just move on,
because we're wasting time here.

550
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,525
Like I say,
the cargo deck's the best place to look.

551
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,157
Somebody messing with ship.

552
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,324
Engine room.

553
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,960
If we're going about this systematically,
we started at the top,

554
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,749
we're working our way down,
so we should try the cargo deck.

555
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,793
Problem from engine room.

556
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,429
We go there now.

557
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,841
All right.
Engine room.

558
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,930
It's gonna be really
hot down there.

559
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,062
Without the power on,
there's no ventilation, no air.

560
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,521
Maybe we should get some water
from the mess down on A deck?

561
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:46,443
Then engine room. Go.
Okay.

562
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,163
This is A deck.

563
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,724
So here we are.

564
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,770
This is the galley.

565
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,102
This is where we make the food.

566
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:35,083
All right. Here, some water.

567
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,579
Check this room.

568
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,880
Oh, you wanna see in here?
This is cold storage.

569
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,294
It's a vegetable room.

570
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,060
Careful in here in the bare feet.

571
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:58,515
You could cut them
on almost anything.

572
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,944
Want some of this melon?
It's left over from breakfast.

573
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,947
It's just gonna go bad.
It's just gonna spoil.

574
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,697
It's usually left out
for the first meal of the day.

575
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,238
Maybe we should--
Go ahead, help yourself. Here you go.

576
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,705
Help yourself.
It's usually for breakfast, but...

577
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,677
Enough. Engine room.

578
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,429
All right.

579
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,361
Cronan. Cronan. Do you read?
Yeah, I got you.

580
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,531
<i>They're on their way to you.
They're on their way to you.</i>

581
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:57,744
One is barefoot.

582
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,536
Is there glass you can break,
leave on the floor by the door?

583
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:05,047
I'll do it. Come on, let's go.
Come on.

584
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,574
Here's the engine room.

585
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:45,830
Oh, my God.

586
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,499
Look out. There's broken glass.
Be careful.

587
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,801
Put your hand up. Up your hands. Up.

588
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,336
- Okay, all right.
- Up.

589
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,600
There's a first-aid kit--
Put your hands up! Who did this?

590
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:02,059
Nobody. It was just a dumb accident.

591
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,566
We should get that looked at.
There's a kit in the control room.

592
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,648
Quiet, Irish. You think
I am stupid?

593
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,438
I know what's going on.

594
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,859
We're going to search this whole room.
All of it. Now go.

595
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,452
Go.

596
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,018
I heard something!

597
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,614
Check the other side.

598
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,159
There's no one here.

599
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,498
Please, let's go back.

600
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:18,097
Go. Right down to the bottom. Now.

601
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,680
They're coming. Get ready.

602
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,200
Keep going. Move.

603
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,882
Wait. Stop here.

604
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,053
What? What'd you do?

605
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,186
We just--
Look at me, Irish. Look at me.

606
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,449
What's wrong with your ship?

607
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,489
Was that you? I don't know.

608
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,533
I don't know what went wrong.
No.

609
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,499
You'll never find this crew,
not without any power on the ship.

610
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,165
You'll never find them.
We'll never find them.

611
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,716
Irish,

612
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,007
I will find.

613
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,301
Not with him.

614
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,013
Look. He's gonna bleed to death.

615
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,598
Look, man, get us out of here.

616
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,057
Aah!
You got a man injured.

617
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,309
Let's take care of his foot,

618
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,942
take the money out of the safe
and call it a day. All right?

619
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,115
You're bad luck, Irish.

620
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,205
Hey, take him upstairs.

621
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,120
I can't move.

622
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,756
Take him upstairs
and tell Najee to come.

623
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,087
You go with him.
We're gonna go?

624
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,048
Go!

625
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,513
Hey.

626
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,219
Wait. Aah!

627
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,180
You're not gonna find anybody.

628
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,016
Don't talk. Go.

629
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:47,155
Your friend make fool of us?
Make us run around?

630
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,871
if one of them moves,
send them to their graves.

631
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,253
Here.

632
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,244
Hey.

633
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,712
We got a problem.

634
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,093
Your buddy's hurt real bad.

635
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:35,851
We better get this dressed. We got a sick bay
here on board, and this guy knows what to do.

636
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,431
What happened to you?

637
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:41,818
They put glass down for me.
They got me.

638
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,524
Where is Muse?

639
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,904
In the engine room.

640
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,943
He wants Najee to come down.

641
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,657
<i>Bridge. Bridge, come in.</i>

642
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,331
<i>Alabama bridge, come in.
Do you read?</i>

643
00:58:55,282 --> 00:59:00,254
<i>This is the crew of the Maersk Alabama.
We have your captain.</i>

644
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,756
<i>Put your hand over his mouth.</i>

645
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,878
- Hey.
-  No.

646
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,419
<i>We have your leader.</i>

647
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,714
We have your captain and his weapon.
We wanna trade.

648
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,974
Captain for captain. We want a deal.

649
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,477
Take that off of his head.
Cronan, take that off his head now.

650
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,761
I no kill.

651
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,477
Talk. Talk to your friends
so they know it's you.

652
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,609
Talk to your friends.
Come on, asshole. Say something.

653
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,645
I love America.

654
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,616
Hey! Get me out of here!

655
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,654
<i>Listen to what these guys have to say.</i>

656
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,826
What happened?

657
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,286
<i>They cut my hand, bad.</i>

658
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:41,170
We'll straighten everything out later.
Just get me out of here.

659
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,547
<i>Give Irish the radio.</i>

660
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,551
I'll give it to him now.

661
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,756
Talk.

662
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:55,635
Uh-- Captain, you know,
if you wanna get off this ship,

663
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,601
<i>you don't have a skiff anymore,
but you could get into our lifeboat.</i>

664
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,108
You could take off
off our stern,

665
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:07,817
and you can go with the $30,000, and
you could get off this ship right now.

666
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,857
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

667
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,777
Say we have a deal.
Say we have a deal.

668
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,697
Okay, Irish. Deal.

669
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:20,000
Deal, Irish, deal.
Okay, then.

670
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,837
Listen, we could--
Hey.

671
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,631
Thirty thousand is nothing.

672
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,091
I want millions!

673
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:04,253
There. All right,
there's the lifeboat.

674
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:09,584
Hey, Bilal, check it out.

675
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,549
If anyone moves, kill them.

676
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,760
Kill them!

677
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,686
Where is our captain?
Where is our guy?

678
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,643
Hey, Cap. Cap, it's Shane.

679
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,310
I'm not armed. I'm not armed.
No weapons. No. Hey, easy.

680
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,776
There's no weapons.
There's no weapons. No weapons.

681
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,282
Hey, Shane. Do you have
the captain? Where is he?

682
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,288
In the engine room.
Bring him up so they can see him.

683
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,664
I wanna see.
You will.

684
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,576
Bring him up so they can see him.
He's on his way.

685
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,375
Where?
Here he is. Yeah, there he is.

686
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,667
- Where?!
- See? There he is. There.

687
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,548
What's going on, Skinny?

688
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,008
Do what they say
and get me out of here.

689
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,514
Be strong, man.

690
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:01,552
Now let's do this. We'll bring up your guy.
You get in, you buckle up.

691
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,018
We drop you in, and then
you're on your way. Okay? Okay?

692
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:09,026
No. You come with us.
Till we get our guy back.

693
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:12,108
No, no, no. You'll get your guy back.
No way!

694
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,442
- Hey! Hey!
- Get in!

695
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,451
Listen! Hey!

696
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,285
You come, or I kill everybody!
I don't care!

697
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,869
It's your choice!

698
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,081
All right! All right!
You go! You go! You're going!

699
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:30,794
Chief, bring the guy up now.
It's gonna be okay. Bring him up.

700
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,301
Shane, you got the crew.
Don't go, Cap. Don't get in there.

701
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,258
- We gotta get them off the ship.
- Not like this.

702
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,173
Cap, you can't do this.
Goddamn it, Cap!

703
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,813
All right, who's driving this thing?

704
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,560
Watch him.

705
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,197
Bilal, hold the gun on him.

706
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,530
Now, look, it's
very simple to operate.

707
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,991
On, off, start, stop.

708
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,996
Compass to follow your heading.

709
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,159
You see your throttle there.
You got a squawk box.

710
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,451
Gas, gas. Enough gas?

711
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,837
Plenty of fuel to get
you to Somalia.

712
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,748
Cap, we got the guy.

713
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,008
All right. Send him on in.
I'm coming out.

714
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,669
Okay, send him in.
Let him go.

715
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,513
Let him go!

716
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,346
Go. Send the captain out.

717
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,513
All right, now, that handle, see?
You're gonna move that up and down.

718
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,900
You gotta pump it, one, two,
three, four, five, and then you drop.

719
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,068
<i>Cap, come on out.</i>

720
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,776
<i>Cap? Cap, what's
going on in there?</i>

721
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:43,203
Just however many times it takes,

722
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,114
pump it, then you're in the
water, and off you go.

723
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,702
Go!

724
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,917
Go back!

725
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,508
Hey, Cap!

726
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,473
Goddamn it! No!

727
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,847
No!
Cap!

728
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,232
Sit! Sit!

729
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,812
Here!

730
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,693
Go.

731
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,279
Irish, it's only us now.

732
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,016
- Stand clear.
- Make a hole.

733
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:53,891
Make way.

734
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,772
Copy.

735
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,314
- Captain's in Combat.
- Captain's in Combat.

736
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,985
CTF 151, this is <i>Bainbridge</i>
Charlie-Oscar. Over.

737
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,074
<i>Captain, this is Admiral Howard.</i>

738
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,827
<i>A U.S.-flagged cargo ship,
the Maersk Alabama,</i>

739
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:14,332
<i>has been hijacked 820 nautical miles
west of your current position.</i>

740
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:18,006
<i>Four men have taken the ship's captain
hostage in a lifeboat.</i>

741
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,587
<i>Presumed Somali pirates. Over.</i>

742
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,670
Roger, ma'am. Do we
have any other information? Over.

743
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:28,434
<i>Not at this time, but best guess
is they're heading for the Somali coast.</i>

744
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,889
<i>Your orders are to proceed
and intercept.</i>

745
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,602
<i>Further to follow.
This is CTF 151 out.</i>

746
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,689
Ops, prep ScanEagle.
Need aerial surveillance.

747
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,520
Aye, sir.

748
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,691
CCS, this is the captain.
Come to full power.

749
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,526
- TAO, get position.
- TAO, aye.

750
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:51,285
Bridge, captain, full left rudder.
Come to course 285.

751
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:21,486
Hufan, do you read me?

752
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,900
Hufan, can you hear me?

753
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,612
Where's your boss?
He should be with us by now.

754
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,623
Don't worry.
He's coming.

755
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,667
Stupid hand.

756
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:48,092
Stop whining.
You sound like a little girl.

757
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:52,634
You wanted to come with us.
You asked for this.

758
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,303
I didn't think this would happen.

759
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,731
I could lose my foot.

760
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,984
You have to be ready for anything.

761
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,736
This game isn't for the weak.

762
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,649
You okay, Irish?

763
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,826
Yeah.

764
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,405
Your face looks scared.

765
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:17,121
But everything gonna be okay.

766
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,500
I'm not gonna hurt you.

767
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,885
In two days we'll be eating
in Somalia.

768
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,678
Rice. Goat meat.
You'll like.

769
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:36,304
My boss talk to ship company.

770
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:40,224
Insurance man come,
bag of dollars,

771
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,233
you go home.

772
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,364
What is it?

773
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,913
It's a gift.

774
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,087
Hey.

775
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:15,801
Irish. You lie, Irish.
Your ship no broke.

776
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,140
They come Somalia too.

777
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,305
More money.

778
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,577
Looks like they're heading north
to the closest point of land.

779
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,912
And that's only gonna
take them 36 hours at the most?

780
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:46,047
Just gotta stay with
them till the Navy gets here.

781
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,889
Give me some khat.

782
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,400
Why? You've had more than your share.

783
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,652
Says who? Give me some more!

784
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,107
Shut up!

785
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,364
Both of you, shut up.

786
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,069
Just take it.

787
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,403
This is it?

788
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,614
That's all I have.

789
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:23,001
- Where is the rest?
- I don't have any.

790
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,206
It's all gone.

791
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,999
You are useless. I
should have taken it from you.

792
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,768
Irish, it's taxes.

793
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:45,432
This money, taking
you, that's all it is.

794
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,564
You come to our waters,
you got to pay.

795
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,650
We were in international waters.

796
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,815
Not your waters,
international waters.

797
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,736
We were carrying food
for starving people in Africa.

798
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,866
Even Somalis.

799
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:04,998
Yeah, sure. Rich countries
like to help Somalis.

800
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,628
Big ships come to our water,

801
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,507
take all the fish out.

802
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:15,762
What's left for us to fish?
So you're fishermen?

803
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,390
Yeah, we're all fishermen.

804
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,935
Hey, let me clean out that cut.

805
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:34,110
Let me get the first-aid kit, clean that out.
It's gonna get infected.

806
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,694
No.

807
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,403
How about the kid?
Can I look at his foot?

808
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,662
No.

809
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,332
They'll fix
him when we get back.

810
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,039
Come on, he's barefoot.
You three got sandals.

811
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,623
He's got bare feet.

812
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:58,925
Go ahead, go.

813
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,179
All right.

814
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,055
Just gonna get the kit.

815
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,175
Go ahead, come here. It's all right.
Your foot. Give me your foot.

816
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,558
Come on.

817
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,766
Let me see it.
It's all right.

818
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:57,317
How old are you, anyway?
What are you, 16, 17?

819
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,369
You're too young to be out here
doing this.

820
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,905
No talking.

821
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,409
No talking.

822
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,758
Hey! Hey!

823
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:24,261
He's got a knife!

824
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,723
Hey! What you gonna do with this?

825
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,314
Go back. Get back there.

826
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,574
UAV ScanEagle shows
the lifeboat is currently

827
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,706
126 nautical miles
off the Somali coast,

828
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,663
moving on course 305
at five knots,

829
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:37,501
with the mothership dead in the water
at 60 miles to the northeast.

830
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,540
We have any idea
who these guys are?

831
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:44,338
<i>The mothership is a Taiwanese
fishing trawler that was hijacked last year.</i>

832
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:49,725
<i>According to ONI, that vessel's under
the control of Somali warlord Garaad.</i>

833
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,683
<i>We're working on getting the IDs
of the kidnappers.</i>

834
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:57,021
If this is Garaad's guys, they're looking
for a payday, which means they'll talk.

835
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,153
If we can get them talking,
we can wear them down. Over.

836
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:04,407
<i>Frank, this thing is running big here,
and there's a lot of pressure building.</i>

837
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:07,489
<i>The White House hopes
this can be resolved peacefully</i>

838
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:11,327
<i>but whatever happens, Captain
Phillips does not reach Somalia.</i>

839
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,833
I understand, admiral,
but we're gonna need some time.

840
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:18,163
I think if we press too hard,
we put the hostage at risk.

841
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,173
We're gonna need to use
some tactical patience. Over.

842
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,632
<i>Do your best to talk them
down, Frank, but you're on the clock.</i>

843
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:28,844
<i>We're deploying a SEAL team with USS
Boxer and USS Halyburton as support.</i>

844
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,260
<i>If you haven't gotten Phillips back
by the time they arrive,</i>

845
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,224
<i>the SEALS will take care of it.</i>

846
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,148
I understand all, admiral.

847
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,653
Can I have some water, please?

848
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,073
Water?

849
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,633
Drive this thing right!

850
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,638
Calm down. We're on the ocean.

851
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,175
I should throw you off this boat
right now!

852
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,014
You need to sit down and relax.

853
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,599
Hey, water.

854
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,820
Hey. Hey.

855
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,116
That's enough.

856
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,869
Take it away.

857
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,372
From now on
this water is only for us.

858
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,209
Stop being such an asshole.

859
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,846
You've got to control him.

860
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,551
Just drive and shut up.

861
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,269
Hufan, can you hear me?

862
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,190
Are you having trouble?

863
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,530
No trouble, Irish. Slow piece of shit.

864
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:54,360
Yeah, yeah. Shallow-draft.

865
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:58,248
And you're fighting the current.
Gotta take that into account.

866
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,331
I know what I'm doing.

867
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:08,124
Yeah, yeah, sure, you do. Of course.
You're the captain now.

868
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,043
Oh, hey, captain,

869
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,966
why don't we open up that hatch
and get a little more air in here?

870
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:18,930
What's wrong with you?

871
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,515
Don't talk to me.

872
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,980
A little air might do him some good.

873
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:37,077
Yeah, open the hatch so your crew...

874
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:42,000
No tricks. No. No tricks, Irish.

875
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,995
Hufan, can you hear me?

876
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,665
Hufan, can you hear me?

877
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:10,232
We should be heading northwest.

878
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,443
We've got to get to Garaad's port.

879
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,075
I am, but there's a lot of wind.

880
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,406
Just go!
Okay, then let me do it.

881
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,830
<i>Muse? Are you there?</i>

882
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:26,835
<i>Are you there?</i>

883
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,581
Hufan, where are you?

884
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,546
<i>I'm having
trouble with the engine.</i>

885
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,672
<i>Head home.
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

886
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,589
Hey, we're alone out here.

887
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,724
We need you to pick us up.

888
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,977
We've got to get out
of this lifeboat.

889
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,684
<i>Shut up and listen to me.</i>

890
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,019
<i>You screwed up getting the ship</i>

891
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,651
<i>so Garaad says
bring back that captain</i>

892
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,688
<i>or don't come back at all.</i>

893
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:01,245
Sounds like there's a problem.
ls there a problem?

894
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,619
Problem.

895
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,039
No problem, Irish.

896
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,247
Everything gonna be okay.

897
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,635
Yes, sir.

898
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:21,890
<i>Here's the latest from SOCOM.</i>

899
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:25,178
<i>Bainbridge CO has until your arrival
to negotiate a surrender.</i>

900
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,730
<i>But upon boarding,
you will assume command.</i>

901
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,434
<i>The White House has authorized
any means necessary to resolve this.</i>

902
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,102
Roger that.

903
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,073
Boss, we're setting up comms
in the bird right now.

904
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,275
I need air.

905
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,701
When are we going to be home?

906
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,582
I can't feel my foot anymore.

907
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,164
It's like hell in here.

908
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,379
You wanna tell him
maybe not to do that?

909
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,388
He wants air.

910
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:46,972
Well, that thing is still loaded.
He's got the clip in it.

911
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:00,739
Talk too much. Too much.

912
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,714
Gonna need some more water.

913
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,550
When we get home,

914
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,807
you'll get a million bottles of it.

915
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:30,094
All the water you want.
Really?

916
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,436
Last year I took a Greek ship.

917
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,648
Six million dollars.

918
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,026
Six million dollars?

919
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,322
So, what are you doing here?

920
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,492
Shut up, Irish.

921
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:56,916
Too much talk.

922
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:02,342
Your problem isn't me talking to you.
Your problem is you not listening.

923
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:14,765
You think
you have any power here?

924
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,560
Let him go.
I should shoot you and be done.

925
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,727
Take your gun off him.

926
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,693
I'm the captain.
Who do you think you are?

927
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:26,985
You're taking his side?

928
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,946
You let the American
do whatever he wants!

929
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,839
I'm losing control!

930
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,752
It's the Americans.

931
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,171
Get something to tie the doors.

932
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:33,767
<i>Alabama lifeboat, this is Frank Castellano,
commander of the USS Bainbridge.</i>

933
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:38,097
We wanna get Captain Phillips back
safely and end this thing peacefully.

934
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,274
No move!
All right.

935
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,615
Alabama <i>lifeboat, come in.</i>

936
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:52,737
No military action.
No military action. No al Qaeda.

937
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,701
We are just fishermen.

938
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,491
<i>Calm down, brother.</i>

939
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:59,661
<i>We're here for the
captain, not for you.</i>

940
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:01,996
They have a spy with them.

941
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,047
Hey, you.
Who are you?

942
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,303
My name is Nemo.

943
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,130
I work with the U.S. Navy.

944
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,767
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

945
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:17,269
I talk English.

946
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:20,522
I want 10 million dollars.

947
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,103
It's not that easy

948
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,977
but we'll work on it.

949
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:28,781
<i>In the meantime, what if I
bring you some food and water?</i>

950
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:41,164
No tricks, or your captain dead.

951
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:59,766
<i>Request to have pilot
ladder lowered and someone standing by.</i>

952
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,478
Shane Murphy?
Yeah, that's me.

953
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,361
Lieutenant Hicks. You're entering
a military engagement zone, sir.

954
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:12,616
Need you to bring the ship left to 210.
We are hereto escort you to Mombasa.

955
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,243
Your captain'll be in good hands.

956
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,825
All right. You heard him, guys.

957
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,589
OSS, keep the
camera on the lifeboat.

958
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,875
ASTAC, aye.

959
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,678
Sir, the boat deck
is manned and ready.

960
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:36,682
VBSS is on station.
Request permission to lower the RHIBs.

961
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,808
- Execute.
- Aye, sir.

962
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,140
Bridge TAO,
launch the RHIBs.

963
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,692
They're coming.

964
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:59,079
Bilal, watch him.

965
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:00,284
Watch him closely.

966
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,754
Irish, your crew,

967
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,374
FUD.

968
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,757
Ship go.

969
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,669
It's the Navy clearing the area.

970
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,218
You better think
about what you're doing.

971
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:23,766
Navy good. They protect us.
Back to Somalia.

972
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,478
The Navy's not here to protect you.

973
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,143
They're not here to negotiate either.

974
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:32,900
No choice.

975
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,530
I got you.

976
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,964
Open your door! We are
here with your supplies.

977
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,137
Guns down!
America, guns down!

978
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,144
Calm down, brother.
We're just here to help you.

979
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,560
Put your guns down now!

980
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,645
<i>One outside and one in the hatch.</i>

981
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:16,315
Push the track on the link.

982
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,572
Listen, we need to see our guy.

983
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,705
We've got supplies,
food, water for you

984
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,740
but we need to see our captain.

985
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:28,536
Okay. Wait.

986
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:29,828
They want to see him.

987
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,462
Bring him out.

988
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:38,838
All right. All right. All right.
Okay, okay. All right. I'm coming.

989
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,597
Down.

990
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:42,929
<i>Visual confirmation.</i>

991
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,764
You all right, captain?

992
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,224
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Yeah, yeah.

993
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,933
Listen.
Does my family know where I am?

994
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,193
Yes, sir. We're keeping them updated.

995
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,395
It's important they know where I am.

996
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,235
I'm in Seat 15.

997
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,071
You understand?

998
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,490
<i>I'm in Seat 15.</i>

999
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,700
All stations, TAO, log it: Seat 15.

1000
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:09,494
Break, CICWO. TAO.
Send that to CTF 151 and SOCOM.

1001
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,669
Don't worry, sir.
We'll handle it.

1002
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,417
Get him back inside.

1003
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,082
Shut up and don't move.

1004
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,588
Calm down, we just want to talk.

1005
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,345
We've got your supplies here.
Food, water.

1006
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,756
Where's the money?

1007
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:25,142
<i>I don't want your food.
I want your money.</i>

1008
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,395
<i>We got another on top.</i>
OSS, maintain camera footage.

1009
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,476
- Hold on a second.
- No tricks, sahib.

1010
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,232
Ten million dollars, sahib.

1011
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,812
Ten million dollars.

1012
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,727
Listen, you're hurt.

1013
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,988
We've got doctors on board.

1014
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,649
Let us take care of you.
Hurry up!

1015
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,410
They're treating us like children.

1016
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:45,115
Ten million dollars, when?

1017
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:48,748
It's not that easy
so we need time.

1018
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,909
<i>We've got to talk about this.</i>

1019
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,828
Hurry up, I said!

1020
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,832
No camera! No camera!

1021
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,385
Gunfire, take cover!

1022
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:04,381
Aah!
Who fired? TAO, who fired?

1023
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:08,093
Get the RHIBs out of there.
Scram the RHIBs, scram the RHIBs.

1024
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:15,776
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

1025
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,858
You'll get us all killed!
Do you have to talk all day?

1026
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,944
You're crazy. What
do you think you're doing?

1027
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,529
All you do is talk!

1028
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,069
Alabama <i>lifeboat, come in.</i>

1029
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:26,282
Move.

1030
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,788
You have to be strong
to get what you want.

1031
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,244
<i>We have to talk.</i>

1032
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,327
Just an accident. Just an accident.

1033
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,086
Is anyone hurt?

1034
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:37,247
No, American fine. American okay.

1035
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,758
I need to hear it from him.

1036
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,091
I say he okay.
I need to hear it from him.

1037
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:50,561
Get up! Get up!

1038
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,014
Move. Move.

1039
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,901
Talk.
Yeah, yeah, it's me.

1040
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,402
Are you okay?

1041
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:03,816
It's falling apart in here. He just
fired off a round next to my head.

1042
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:08,278
Is the leader there?
Yeah, he can hear you.

1043
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,790
<i>Captain, listen to me.
We will not tolerate this.</i>

1044
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:15,373
<i>As captain, you're responsible
for the lives of everyone on board.</i>

1045
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,921
<i>Right now
you are putting them in jeopardy.</i>

1046
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,127
We wanna resolve this thing
peacefully.

1047
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:25,091
<i>Let's find a way out of this together
before someone gets hurt.</i>

1048
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,019
Alabama lifeboat, respond.

1049
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,731
I talk when I go Somalia.

1050
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:38,733
Sit down.

1051
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,485
Sit down!

1052
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:52,204
<i>TAO, lifeboat is under way.</i>

1053
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:53,490
TAO, aye.

1054
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:57,412
Captain, sir, the lifeboat's 12 hours
from the Somali coast.

1055
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,545
Boxer and Halyburton
have arrived.

1056
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:03,379
ETA on the SEAL team is 0400.

1057
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,319
Irish, no worry.

1058
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,656
Everything gonna be okay.

1059
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:41,213
After this, I go America.

1060
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,129
I always wanted to go America.

1061
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,635
Go to New York, buy a car...

1062
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,730
Hey, this situation has gotten bad.

1063
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:02,688
There are two more ships,
one on either side.

1064
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,570
That one is huge.

1065
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:13,452
Oh, God.

1066
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,613
Sit down! Sit down!

1067
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,408
- Sit down!
- Down! Down!

1068
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,163
Bilal, get the ropes.

1069
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:26,629
Hey, captain, it's all over.
It's all over, captain.

1070
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,088
The other ropes.

1071
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,638
There's a reason your boss took off
and isn't coming back.

1072
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:35,175
He didn't wanna take on the Navy.
He's gone. He's left you alone.

1073
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:40,310
You had a plan to take my ship. That didn't
work, so you thought you could take me?

1074
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:42,224
- Shut up.
- Make a run to Somalia?

1075
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,690
They got the Navy out there.
You gotta give up. You gotta stop.

1076
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:47,604
I can't stop, Irish.

1077
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:51,150
The Navy is not gonna let you win.
They can't let you win.

1078
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:55,746
They would rather sink this boat
than let you get me back to Somalia.

1079
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:56,951
It's over.

1080
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:02,995
I come too far, Irish.

1081
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:07,549
I can't give up. No.

1082
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:32,695
Hello?

1083
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,986
<i>The SEALs are inbound, deploying
three miles off our stern.</i>

1084
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,529
Roger that.

1085
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:50,610
I need to piss.

1086
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:54,071
Fast

1087
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:22,759
Saltwater would be good for your foot.

1088
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,356
He got out!

1089
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,142
Turn the boat around!

1090
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,936
Bilal, you idiot!

1091
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,873
Turn it! Faster, faster!

1092
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,508
Move, or we'll leave you!

1093
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,714
Captain's in Combat.

1094
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:00,380
Cap. We got two in the water.
Two in the water.

1095
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,057
Starboard side, I see them both.

1096
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:04,721
Two guys in the water.

1097
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:07,930
- Is one of them Phillips?
- We don't know. We can't tell.

1098
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,440
They're in the water.
In the water.

1099
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,814
One may be Phillips
and probably one pirate. We don't know.

1100
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,320
We've gotta be sure.

1101
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:17,105
Let's get a flare in the air.

1102
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:21,151
Find him. Don't kill him.

1103
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,461
Don't shoot!

1104
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,721
I'll shoot you!

1105
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,262
Stop! What are you doing?

1106
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:48,178
He's getting away!

1107
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:54,601
Don't kill him!
Better to kill him than let him escape!

1108
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,732
There he is!

1109
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,446
I'm ordering you. Don't kill him.

1110
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:11,456
<i>Bainbridge, this
is RHIB 3. We have SEALs inbound.</i>

1111
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:17,041
Flare's up, captain. Target angle
020 on the lifeboat right now.

1112
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,293
Can't tell who's in the water.

1113
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,053
No clear shot at the Tangos.

1114
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:24,760
Nobody shoots
unless there's a clear shot.

1115
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,341
Where is he?

1116
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,432
Here he is! Here he is!

1117
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,699
He's here!

1118
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:55,503
One more in the water. We've
got one more in the water.

1119
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:57,288
Help!

1120
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:05,676
Help!

1121
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:17,024
All right!

1122
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:19,353
- Come!
- All right!

1123
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,192
- Come! Forward!
- All right!

1124
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,356
Got him.

1125
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:24,945
Come!

1126
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:27,577
Okay, okay.

1127
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:32,453
Go in, Irish! Go! Go, Irish!

1128
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,085
Sir, the SEALs
are coming aboard.

1129
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,788
<i>Prepare to board the SEALs.</i>

1130
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:56,310
Where are you go?
Tell me! Tell me!

1131
01:38:56,472 --> 01:38:58,065
Are you crazy?

1132
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:04,815
Where's the captain?
Waiting for you on the bridge, sir.

1133
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:14,077
Not today!

1134
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,492
Stop him!

1135
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,715
That's enough!

1136
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:28,971
Don't kill him!

1137
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:33,301
If you kill him, we'll all die!

1138
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:38,856
What do you want me to do with him?
What is he doing?

1139
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:50,860
Bainbridge to lifeboat,
you must surrender.

1140
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:53,155
<i>You will not
be permitted to go further.</i>

1141
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:55,164
It's a helicopter!

1142
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,496
Get to the other side!

1143
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:04,040
Alabama <i>lifeboat, respond.</i>

1144
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:05,709
Hurry! Go!

1145
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:06,967
I'm trying.

1146
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,803
Go!

1147
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:16,936
<i>You have a choice to make, captain.
Surrender now and this ends peacefully.</i>

1148
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,768
<i>Beyond that, I cannot help you.
You must surrender.</i>

1149
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:22,525
They think you are playing games.

1150
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,777
Do something!

1151
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,358
<i>You cannot win this.</i>

1152
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:35,284
Make the right decision here.

1153
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,325
You are running out of time.
Do you understand me?

1154
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,835
Do you want to go
to an American prison?

1155
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,666
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

1156
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:44,796
Is that what you want?

1157
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,383
I know how to handle America.

1158
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,419
Give me the pistol.

1159
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:52,968
They think I'm playing games, huh?

1160
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,592
Go!

1161
01:40:56,425 --> 01:40:58,223
Go!

1162
01:40:58,427 --> 01:41:00,304
Up ladder.

1163
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:04,521
Make a hole.

1164
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:17,243
<i>Target in the hatch.
This is Bainbridge out.</i>

1165
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:20,075
They're holding a gun
to Phillips' head.

1166
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:23,666
He's kind of yelling
and waving his pistol back and forth.

1167
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:30,343
I kill him! I kill him!
Now! I kill him!

1168
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,139
We got shots fired, captain.

1169
01:41:35,298 --> 01:41:37,471
- How many shots?
- Who fired? Who fired?

1170
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,601
We're losing this.

1171
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:49,691
Now what?

1172
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,321
They have no respect for us.

1173
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:54,029
We have to play games?

1174
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,740
Give me the radio.

1175
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:06,125
The helicopter is coming back.

1176
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:11,383
America, I kill hostage now!

1177
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,967
I kill hostage now!
I'm gonna put him in a body bag!

1178
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,274
Talk. Talk.

1179
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:32,735
They got a gun to my throat, and they're
gonna use a survival suit as a body bag.

1180
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:41,246
You're not just a fisherman.

1181
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:44,500
You're not just a fisherman.

1182
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:52,918
<i>Men of the Alabama
lifeboat, I'm here to talk about your money.</i>

1183
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:57,009
<i>Repeat, I'm here to
discuss your money.</i>

1184
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,636
Who is this?

1185
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:06,977
I'm the negotiator.
I'm authorized to negotiate with you.

1186
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:11,610
Insurance man?

1187
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:15,819
Now, you are Abduwali Muse, right?
From Jariban, Puntland?

1188
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:18,951
<i>From the clans of the Hawiye
and the Daarood?</i>

1189
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,783
<i>Your friends are Adan Bilal</i>

1190
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:24,035
Walid Elmi and Nour Najee.

1191
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:27,953
<i>But you are Muse. You're in command.
Is that correct?</i>

1192
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,165
They know us.

1193
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,379
We spoke with the
elders of your tribe.

1194
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:38,388
They are coming here to negotiate
a deal, an exchange.

1195
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:42,467
<i>We get our man, you get your money.
But this has to be done in confidence.</i>

1196
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:46,137
<i>We don't want anyone to see
the exchange. Neither do the elders.</i>

1197
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:47,429
It's a lie.

1198
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:50,770
You're low on fuel.
We got some weather coming in,

1199
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:55,279
so I'm suggesting that we tow you out
to the exchange point.

1200
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:58,658
<i>But we need someone to come aboard
and negotiate the deal.</i>

1201
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,238
It's an ambush.

1202
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:02,903
Captain.

1203
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,415
Okay.

1204
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,503
It's an ambush.

1205
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,706
Keep me posted on status.

1206
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:57,258
Roger.
Comms test radio check.

1207
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:04,595
OSS, TAO, I need eyes on the RHIB.
I need eyes on the RHIB.

1208
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,676
Captain's in Combat.

1209
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:10,138
Tactical command
is now with the SEAL team.

1210
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:13,065
TAO, where we at?

1211
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:15,518
RHIBs are headed
inbound to the lifeboat.

1212
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:18,437
<i>Halyburton and Boxer</i> are standing by
for your orders.

1213
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:22,029
ASTAC, TAO,
I need a status at Halyburton's helo.

1214
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,758
You need to be strong.

1215
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,097
Don't let anyone in.

1216
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,982
Whatever happens, don't stop.

1217
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:00,691
It's my job.

1218
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:12,158
Everything good, Irish.

1219
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:16,375
Everything gonna be okay.

1220
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:19,336
I go Navy ship.

1221
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,543
Get dollars,

1222
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:25,963
you go home.

1223
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:32,974
It was supposed to be easy.

1224
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:36,682
I take ship...

1225
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:40,148
ransom...

1226
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:44,322
nobody get hurt.

1227
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:48,657
You had $30,000
and a way to Somalia.

1228
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:52,456
It wasn't enough?

1229
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:57,207
I got bosses.

1230
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:59,747
They got rules.

1231
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,258
We all got bosses.

1232
01:47:07,338 --> 01:47:10,342
There's gotta be something
other than being a fisherman

1233
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:12,305
and kidnapping people.

1234
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:17,640
Maybe in America, Irish.

1235
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:20,230
Maybe in America.

1236
01:47:25,522 --> 01:47:30,779
<i>Alabama</i> lifeboat, this is
the U.S. Navy. Open the hatch.

1237
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:40,288
Gun down.
Put the gun down.

1238
01:47:40,829 --> 01:47:44,049
Relax. I need
to see the captain.

1239
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,006
- I show you captain. Back.
- Relax.

1240
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,465
I show you captain.
Back.

1241
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:48,880
- Come on up.
- Back.

1242
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,466
Listen. We gotta
move our other boat closer.

1243
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:53,259
Up.

1244
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:55,143
We gotta hook up a towline.

1245
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:58,306
- No tricks.
- No tricks. No tricks.

1246
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,566
We just wanna see the captain

1247
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:04,194
and then get you to the ship
for the meeting with the elders.

1248
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:06,196
Anything happen, he die.

1249
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,442
<i>Anything happen, he die. I tell you.</i>

1250
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:12,157
Sir, we have ears on the boat.
Check.

1251
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:14,701
Okay, here he comes.

1252
01:48:15,948 --> 01:48:18,371
Be advised,
I have eyes on the package.

1253
01:48:18,993 --> 01:48:20,916
Captain, are you okay?

1254
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:25,549
- Yeah, yeah. Are you taking care of this?
- This'll be over soon.

1255
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:28,962
Hey, captain, I got a uniform,
a clean uniform.

1256
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,380
I need you to wear this.

1257
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,056
And stay in the seat
you've been sitting in.

1258
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:36,560
Put this on, captain.
We need to keep you healthy.

1259
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,604
<i>It's very important
that we keep you healthy.</i>

1260
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:43,396
Stay calm.
It's going to be okay.

1261
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:46,153
- Go back.
- Just relax.

1262
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:48,359
Here, take it.

1263
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,824
Inside. Go.

1264
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:56,493
Go.

1265
01:48:56,697 --> 01:49:00,201
- Where are the elders?
- The elders are being flown in.

1266
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:03,704
Put the gun inside.
We'll take you to your elders.

1267
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,589
Anything happen, he die.

1268
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:08,672
I give you my word.
Everything will be fine.

1269
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:11,053
Put the gun down.

1270
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:12,463
Gun down.

1271
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:15,508
Wait.

1272
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:20,012
Come on aboard. Just relax.

1273
01:49:20,596 --> 01:49:21,722
- Take my hand.
- Relax.

1274
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,266
We're almost there. Relax.

1275
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:26,686
We got you. Come on.
Nice and easy. Okay.

1276
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:29,230
Everything's gonna be okay.

1277
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:36,738
Captain, it'll be over soon.
Hang tough.

1278
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:40,249
Stay in the same seat
you've been sitting in.

1279
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:49,049
Two-two-four feet.

1280
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:50,835
Stern seas.

1281
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:54,718
Okay, the wind shouldn't be a factor.

1282
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,427
Where do we need to be?

1283
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,764
She's at 235 meters.
Ninety-one's gonna be optimal.

1284
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:04,353
Sir, one Somali is extracted. RHIB is
headed inbound. Towline is attached.

1285
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:08,816
TAO, let's initiate high-speed maneuver.
Aye, sir.

1286
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:13,824
<i>Halyburton, Boxer.
This is Bainbridge.</i>

1287
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:16,076
<i>Commence high-speed maneuvers.
Over.</i>

1288
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:20,747
Bring him over here.

1289
01:50:21,323 --> 01:50:22,825
Here.

1290
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:27,545
Okay, get it off of him.

1291
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,709
Come up this way.
Up this way.

1292
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:33,293
Hey, go right here.

1293
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,430
I'm Chief O'Brien.
Let's get you taken care of inside.

1294
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:38,473
Take him inside.
Get him looked at.

1295
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,680
- Can I see your hand?
- No. Where elders?

1296
01:50:40,843 --> 01:50:43,437
We'll talk about that later.
We're going this way.

1297
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:47,600
Through this door. Watch your head.
This way. Let's go.

1298
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,980
Stand over here.

1299
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:52,022
One suspected pirate on
board in the starboard hangar.

1300
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:54,448
<i>Copy that.</i>
Hold it.

1301
01:50:54,606 --> 01:50:56,358
Right there.

1302
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:00,241
Where are the elders?

1303
01:51:00,863 --> 01:51:04,868
The elders will be here soon.
Relax. We're gonna take care of you.

1304
01:51:23,552 --> 01:51:27,102
Your captain knows what he's doing.
You're gonna get your money now.

1305
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,537
What's going on?

1306
01:51:47,242 --> 01:51:49,336
I can't see.

1307
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:52,040
Give me the radio.

1308
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:59,464
Too much light. We no see.

1309
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,349
We're going to initiate the tow.

1310
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:05,511
<i>I repeat, we are going
to initiate the tow.</i>

1311
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:09,773
You need to tell your driver
that he needs to stay in his seat

1312
01:52:09,932 --> 01:52:12,105
<i>and continue steering.</i>

1313
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:44,258
Alfa team is green at this time.
One green, two red.

1314
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:46,597
Lifeboat's under tow.
We're at five knots.

1315
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,855
Copy that.
We need three targets green.

1316
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:55,774
Keep it steady. Keep it steady.

1317
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:15,331
Hey. Hey.
I'm just putting on the shirt like they said.

1318
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:19,627
if he moves again, shoot him.

1319
01:53:19,793 --> 01:53:21,921
Sir, the pirates have
just issued a threat.

1320
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:23,714
What's the translation?

1321
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,349
"If he moves again,
shoot him."

1322
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:43,442
It's getting rough.

1323
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,907
Keep it straight.

1324
01:53:48,864 --> 01:53:49,911
TAO, aye.

1325
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:54,499
High-speed maneuvers are creating big
waves headed inbound on the lifeboat.

1326
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,788
Slow down! You make waves!

1327
01:54:33,575 --> 01:54:36,124
What kind of games are they playing?

1328
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:39,422
I can't hold it straight.

1329
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:45,046
Be a man.
Just shut up and steer.

1330
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:51,469
American ship, answer me.

1331
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:52,761
U.S.A., answer me!

1332
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:55,768
Alfa's green.
Bravo and Charlie are red.

1333
01:54:57,516 --> 01:54:59,814
<i>Too much waves!</i>

1334
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:03,901
<i>U.S. Navy.
Too much waves!</i>

1335
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:08,319
Alabama lifeboat, this is negotiator.
We'll pull you into our wake.

1336
01:55:08,485 --> 01:55:12,831
<i>If you ride in our wake, it'll be
smoother. Negotiator out.</i>

1337
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,354
Irish. Irish. What you doing?

1338
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:38,561
What you doing?

1339
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:04,424
Alfa team green.
One green, two red.

1340
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,343
Give me a distance.

1341
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,466
Two twenty.
Still 129 out.

1342
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:17,854
Stop writing, Irish.

1343
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:21,391
If he sees you, he kill
me and you both.

1344
01:56:23,059 --> 01:56:25,187
American ship.

1345
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:26,479
Answer me.

1346
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:28,903
<i>U.S. Navy, answer!</i>

1347
01:56:30,567 --> 01:56:32,490
<i>I speak to Muse!</i>

1348
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:36,619
I want to speak with him!

1349
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:39,955
Alfa and Charlie teams green.
Bravo red.

1350
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:42,291
Alabama lifeboat, this
is the negotiator.

1351
01:56:42,454 --> 01:56:45,958
Your leader is in the helo hangar
waiting for the elders.

1352
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:49,510
Where are the elders?

1353
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:52,465
Where are elders?

1354
01:56:54,591 --> 01:56:57,265
American ship, answer!

1355
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,350
Hey.

1356
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:03,734
Hey! What is this?
What is this you writing? Tell me!

1357
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:09,273
They've got something going on.
I think it's a fight.

1358
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:11,403
Stop! Stop!

1359
01:57:12,692 --> 01:57:13,784
Pull up the audio.

1360
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:17,369
TAO, give me Screen 3 on the left.

1361
01:57:19,908 --> 01:57:21,706
Stop him.

1362
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:23,871
Bilal, stop him.

1363
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:31,674
Stop Irish! Stop Irish!

1364
01:57:31,836 --> 01:57:34,009
Bring the rope!

1365
01:57:35,507 --> 01:57:38,101
Alfa and Charlie are red.
We are three red.

1366
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:40,433
Alabama lifeboat, this
is the negotiator.

1367
01:57:40,595 --> 01:57:43,064
If you harm the hostage,
we do not have a deal.

1368
01:57:43,807 --> 01:57:45,309
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1369
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:50,647
Tie him!

1370
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:56,950
Alabama lifeboat, if you harm
the hostage, we do not have a deal.

1371
01:57:57,153 --> 01:57:58,200
Do you understand?

1372
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,840
What are you doing?

1373
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:17,762
Captain Phillips,
can you hear me?

1374
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:21,769
- Captain Phillips, can you hear me?
- He's screaming, sir.

1375
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:26,521
One fifty-five. They're 64 meters out.
One fifty-five, check. Speed up the tow.

1376
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,712
Shut up!

1377
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:54,211
Get a blindfold!

1378
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,470
Can you see this?

1379
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:01,138
Can you see it?

1380
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:04,812
Let's reacquire targets,
weapons release on my command.

1381
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:07,812
One thirty-five meters.
That's 44 out from optimal.

1382
01:59:07,974 --> 01:59:10,898
Alfa green.
Bravo and Charlie are still red. Two red.

1383
01:59:11,353 --> 01:59:13,401
Blindfold him.

1384
01:59:17,067 --> 01:59:21,117
Kid, just put your hands up.
You're just a kid.

1385
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:23,077
Put your weapons down
and put your hands up.

1386
01:59:23,782 --> 01:59:24,829
Put your hands up!

1387
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,671
Is anybody hearing this?

1388
01:59:31,998 --> 01:59:34,717
Tell my family I love them.

1389
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,545
Andrea, I love you.

1390
01:59:37,504 --> 01:59:38,756
I love you, Ange.

1391
01:59:39,547 --> 01:59:40,764
Honey, I love you.

1392
01:59:42,509 --> 01:59:44,352
I love you, Danny. I'm sorry.

1393
01:59:44,511 --> 01:59:48,982
I'm sorry I'm here
and not there with you.

1394
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:53,232
<i>Can anybody hear this?
I can't stand this anymore.</i>

1395
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:55,985
One thirty meters.
That's 39 out from optimal.

1396
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:58,195
Two red. No shot.
Still at two red.

1397
01:59:58,358 --> 02:00:02,113
I need sights on targets.
I need three targets green.

1398
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:07,621
Don't kill him!

1399
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:09,832
The elders are coming.

1400
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,371
We will get our money.

1401
02:00:11,538 --> 02:00:13,961
You are both idiots.

1402
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:15,717
No one is coming.

1403
02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:26,470
Alfa green, Bravo green.
Two green, one red.

1404
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:29,731
- One twenty-one. Thirty meters out.
<i>- I can't take any more.</i>

1405
02:00:29,889 --> 02:00:31,641
I'm all done.

1406
02:00:31,808 --> 02:00:33,651
I'm all done.

1407
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:37,064
That's it.
We will all die if you kill him.

1408
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,904
Everything they told you was a lie!

1409
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,784
They will kill us all,

1410
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:44,071
and he is behind everything!

1411
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:46,456
One seventeen meters.
Two green, one red.

1412
02:00:46,614 --> 02:00:48,662
- We do not have a shot.
- I need eyes on.

1413
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:50,418
Sir, they're gonna shoot him.

1414
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,344
Gun drawn. Gun drawn.
Stop the tow.

1415
02:00:59,502 --> 02:01:00,628
Roger. Stop the tow.

1416
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:05,804
Execute.

1417
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:14,188
What was that?

1418
02:01:48,468 --> 02:01:51,142
Oh, no!

1419
02:02:16,579 --> 02:02:19,128
We're gonna get you
out of here and get you home.

1420
02:02:24,754 --> 02:02:25,846
Take him down.

1421
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,633
<i>- The hostage is safe.
- Get down.</i>

1422
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,019
- Put your head down.
- What?

1423
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:34,226
- Good job, guys. We got them.
- Three Tangos down.

1424
02:02:34,389 --> 02:02:37,359
Captain Phillips is safe and en route.
Bainbridge, over.

1425
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:38,769
Well done, everybody.

1426
02:02:38,935 --> 02:02:42,565
Right here. Go to this guy right here.
Come with me, captain.

1427
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:44,941
You just sit down.

1428
02:02:45,817 --> 02:02:48,320
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1429
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:58,209
This way.

1430
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:03,297
- Watch your step.
- Step.

1431
02:03:07,255 --> 02:03:09,007
Careful, sir.

1432
02:03:12,135 --> 02:03:16,265
Welcome aboard. These guys are gonna take
you to medical, get you checked out.

1433
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:19,605
HM 1, he has impact
injuries. He's in shock.

1434
02:03:19,767 --> 02:03:22,236
Okay. Are you able
to walk okay, sir?

1435
02:03:22,437 --> 02:03:24,781
Are you okay?
What's your name?

1436
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:27,613
Urn, Rich. Rich Phillips.

1437
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:32,660
We're gonna turn you over
to the Department of Justice.

1438
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:35,575
You're going to America
to face trial.

1439
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:37,835
You shoot my friends?

1440
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:41,088
Uh, Captain Phillips is free.
All of your friends are dead.

1441
02:03:42,999 --> 02:03:46,299
It's over.
You're going to America now.

1442
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:48,634
You have been suspected
of piracy.

1443
02:03:48,796 --> 02:03:51,424
I am now gonna read
you your rights.

1444
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:54,811
You have the right to remain silent
and make no statement.

1445
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:58,311
Any statement can be used against you
in judicial proceedings.

1446
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:04,605
Captain Phillips, please come in.

1447
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:07,402
Have a seat.

1448
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:09,734
Trauma shears.

1449
02:04:10,276 --> 02:04:12,745
I'm Chief O'Brien.
I'll be your corpsman today.

1450
02:04:12,946 --> 02:04:15,290
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

1451
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:17,909
Can you talk?

1452
02:04:18,076 --> 02:04:20,920
Can you tell me what's going on?
Yeah. Uh... Uh...

1453
02:04:21,079 --> 02:04:22,296
I'm okay.

1454
02:04:22,497 --> 02:04:24,716
Are you okay?
Because you don't look okay.

1455
02:04:24,916 --> 02:04:27,214
Are you in any pain right now?

1456
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:31,055
Are you in pain right now?
Uh... Uh...

1457
02:04:31,214 --> 02:04:32,887
Right there, on your side.

1458
02:04:33,049 --> 02:04:34,801
Okay. Let me see it really quick.

1459
02:04:35,009 --> 02:04:37,387
Can you lift up your arm?
Does that hurt?

1460
02:04:37,553 --> 02:04:38,930
Little bit?
 Little bit.

1461
02:04:39,097 --> 02:04:41,441
Is it tender?
Go ahead and put your arm down.

1462
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,601
I need you to look at me.
Calm down,

1463
02:04:43,768 --> 02:04:46,112
and I need you to breathe.
Deep breaths.

1464
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:47,567
There you go.
Very good.

1465
02:04:48,189 --> 02:04:50,362
Awesome.
Now I want you to relax your arm.

1466
02:04:50,566 --> 02:04:53,911
We're gonna put this on,
get your heart rate and oxygen level,

1467
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:56,038
make sure you're breathing.
Okay.

1468
02:04:56,197 --> 02:04:58,120
I want you to keep
doing that, okay?

1469
02:04:58,282 --> 02:05:00,159
Gonna put this on your finger.

1470
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,545
Can you tell me
what happened to your head?

1471
02:05:02,704 --> 02:05:04,377
Put it on your finger.

1472
02:05:04,539 --> 02:05:06,291
Uh... They, uh...

1473
02:05:09,377 --> 02:05:11,095
It's okay, take your time.

1474
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:14,554
There's a 2-centimeter laceration
on the left eyebrow.

1475
02:05:15,925 --> 02:05:17,472
It's okay. It's all right.

1476
02:05:17,635 --> 02:05:21,060
Okay. Okay.
I want you to look at me and breathe.

1477
02:05:21,222 --> 02:05:22,269
- Understand?
- Yeah.

1478
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:23,729
Okay, all right.

1479
02:05:23,891 --> 02:05:28,567
He's got a 4-centimeter gap. Little
laceration there on the left temple.

1480
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:30,403
- Got it.
- Okay. Very good.

1481
02:05:30,565 --> 02:05:32,192
All right.
You're doing great, okay?

1482
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:35,904
Did all this blood come
from your eyebrow and your head?

1483
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:37,576
What?

1484
02:05:37,739 --> 02:05:40,458
Did the blood come
from your eyebrow and your head?

1485
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:42,710
All of this.
Well, no, not all of it.

1486
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:45,247
Okay.
That's not mine.

1487
02:05:45,455 --> 02:05:48,083
Okay, all right, all right.
Look at me.

1488
02:05:48,249 --> 02:05:49,967
We're gonna lay you down.
Okay.

1489
02:05:50,126 --> 02:05:52,220
All right.
Yeah.

1490
02:05:52,378 --> 02:05:55,006
I want you to lay down nice and gently.
Nice and gently.

1491
02:05:55,173 --> 02:05:57,892
Aah.
You're okay. I got you.

1492
02:05:58,301 --> 02:06:00,724
There you go. Very good.
Unh.

1493
02:06:00,887 --> 02:06:02,639
Captain, you're safe now, okay?

1494
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:05,399
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1495
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,276
You're okay.
 Thank you.

1496
02:06:07,435 --> 02:06:08,982
You're welcome.

1497
02:06:09,145 --> 02:06:12,274
Does my family know?
Your family knows you're safe.

1498
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:15,907
You'll be able to call them
as soon as you are taken care of.

1499
02:06:18,196 --> 02:06:20,290
Sir, I need you
to breathe, okay?

1500
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:23,042
You are safe and you are fine.

1501
02:06:23,826 --> 02:06:25,703
It's gonna be okay.

1502
02:06:26,788 --> 02:06:29,007
Everything's gonna be okay.

1503
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,423
It's gonna be okay.
