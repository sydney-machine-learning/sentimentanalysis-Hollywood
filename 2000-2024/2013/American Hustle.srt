You understand that he has...
It wasn't working.

134
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,315
He was getting upset
about the sheik and...

135
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,819
Did you ever have
to find a way to survive,

136
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,789
and you knew your
choices were bad?

137
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,461
I learned how to survive
when I was a kid.

138
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,426
My father had
a glass business.

139
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,003
I would rather be
on the taking side

140
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,231
than the getting-taken side
any day of the week,

141
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,935
especially after! saw
how my father got taken.

142
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,734
I mean, seeing that
scarred me for life.

143
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,473
I took it upon myself
to drum up business.

144
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,648
I became a different kind
of guy than my father.

145
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,451
I became a con
artist for real.

146
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,921
From the feet up.

147
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:06,260
I was gonna survive
no matter what.

148
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,358
I still had the glass business and
a few dry cleaning stores also,

149
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,670
and I did some art
dealing on the side.

150
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,763
Stolen or forged art.

151
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,106

154
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,772

pool party in Long Island.

00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,904
Is that Duke
Ellington on your bracelet?

156
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,637
Yeah,
as a matter of fact, it is.

157
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,009
He died this year,
you know?

158
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,480
I know.

159
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,313

knows or cares about it.

160
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,747
Well, I care about it.

many times.

Right now?

171
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,170
Yeah.
Sure.

172
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,353
Who starts a song
like that?

173
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,030
It's magic.

174
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,532
It's magic.

175
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,039
He wasn't
necessarily in good shape,

176
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,137
and he had this comb-over
that was rather elaborate.

177
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,550
He had this air about him,

178
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,587
and he had this confidence
that drew me to him.

179
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,551
He was who he was.

180
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,883
He didn't care.

181
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,894
I mean, she was
a very particular person.

182
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,063
Like me,
she had come from a place

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,730
where her
options were limited.

184
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,416
I! actually can feel
kind of sexy sometimes.

185
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,016
There's a boldness in it.

186
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,418
But where would
that boldness take me?

187
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,293
I didn't know.

188
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,161
But I was gonna find out.

189
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,437
Like me, she learned to
survive and rein vent herself.

190
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,440
She knew she had to reinvent
her life and her identity.

191
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:08,677
And like me, she envisioned a
better, elegant future for herself.

192
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,506
Like me, she knew
you had to have a vision.

193
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,384
She came to New York,
she envisioned it,

194
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,512
and just like that...

195
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,352
she applied for a job
at Cosmopolitan magazine.

196
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,392
<i>Well, you're obviously
here for</i> a <i>reason, let's get to it.</i>

197
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,462
All right. Our cover story
right now is on cunnilingus.

198
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,861
What do you think
about that?

199
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,962
I like it.

200
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,061
Do you have any clerical skills?
Can you type?

201
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,334
She was unlike
anybody I ever knew.

202
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,534
She was smart.

203
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,042
She saw through
people in situations,

204
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,012
and she knew how to live
with passion and style,

205
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,379
She understood Duke Ellington.

206
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,324
I was broke, fearless,
with nothing to lose,

207
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,893
and my dream,
more than anything,

208
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,522
was to become anyone else
other than who I was.

209
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,600
He had a chain
of dry cleaning stores.

210
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,575
Enter. Yeah, I got
two in the Bronx,

211
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,671
and three in Manhattan.

212
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,241
Hey, Byron, how you doing?
This is Sydney.

213
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,376
Right here, come through here.
Hi.

214
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,685
He asked me if I wanted to
come in and upgrade my wardrobe.

215
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,691
He said he had
a lot of nice things

216
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,126
that got left behind by people
and forgotten over the years.

217
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,628
Man, you wouldn't
believe the shit

218
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,756
that people leave behind here.
Unbelievable.

219
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,265
People leave stuff here?
Come back here.

220
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,926
Oh, yeah,
they go out for the night,

221
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,867
you know, they drink,

222
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,303
come here in the morning,

223
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,032
put their clothes in
and then they forget

224
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,370
They got no idea
where they left it.

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,932
Look at that sequin thing.
It's beautiful.

226
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,272
I don't know,
is that nice or not?

227
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,779
I mean, some of it... Some
of it's been here for years.

228
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,542
They're not picking it up.

229
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,106
No one's picking it up.
People just leave...

230
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,981
You like it?
I love it.

231
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,382
Sydney, it's yours.

232
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,922
You want it,
it's yours.

233
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,221
Whoo!

234
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,125
I like it.

235
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,821
You look fantastic.

236
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,829
You're a knockout.

237
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,925
Oh, my God.

238
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,300
I could only dream about...

239
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,237
These dresses are beautiful.
Oh!

240
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,643
This...
That's... I'm...

241
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,905
No, it's beautiful.
Put it on.

242
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,572
Come on.

243
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,809
Come on, look at that.
Please?

244
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,975
Perfect for you.

245
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,074
I don't feel...

246
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,813
Really?

247
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,979
Love it.

248
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,284
This is for you.

249
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,287
I felt like we had
a secret, just the two of us,

250
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,160
you know, like that thing
when you just want to be

251
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,665
with the one person
the whole time and

252
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,928
you feel like the two of you
understand something

253
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,698
that nobody else gets.

254
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,131
I could just tell her
everything about myself.

255
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:02,113
<i>And Pd never had anybody
like that in my fife before,</i>

256
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,721
and it felt like, finally,

257
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,848
I could truly be myself

258
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,892
without being ashamed,

259
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,018
without being embarrassed.

260
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,393
What is this place?

261
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,058
Do you sell art here?

262
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,533
Yeah, sometimes.

263
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,331
It's my office.

264
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,997
Well, I know
it's your office,

265
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,734
but you have all
these other places,

266
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,639
so what's this for'?

267
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,576
Why'd you bring me here?

268
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,539
This is getting to be my...
My main business,

269
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,173
my growing business.

270
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,650
L, uh...

271
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,745
I help get loans for guys
who can't get loans.

272
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,221
You know,
I'm their last resort.

273
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,552
You're their last resort?

274
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,587
'Cause interest rates are north
of 12% and heading to 18%.

275
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,357
That's right,
smarty pants.

276
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,327
Fucking Jimmy Carter.
Fucking Jimmy Carter.

277
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,527
Well, fucking Nixon, really,

278
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,900
and the war and the deficit
and all of that shit, but...

279
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,699
I fucking love you,
you're so smart.

280
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,496
You are.

281
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,769
Thanks, kid, but how do you
get them the money?

282
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,743
Well...

283
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,510
You don't, do you?

284
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,910
You don't.

285
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,790
These guys are
lousy risks, you know?

286
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,257
I can't get them a loan,

287
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,350
but I get my fee, $5,000.

288
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,555
$5,000?

289
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,122
You take $5,000 and you
don't give them anything.

290
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,393
All right, these are
bad guys, you know?

291
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,094
They got bad divorces,
gambling habits,

292
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,193
embezzling, all that shit,
you know what I mean?

293
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,906
Everybody at the bottom
crosses paths eventually

294
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:36,709
in a pool of desperation
and you're waiting for them.

295
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,481
How about "we"?

296
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,076
"We"?
Mmm-hmm.

297
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,712
How about it?

298
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,557
Sydney, Sydney,
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,221
That was too much,
I went too far.

300
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,493
I didn't want to upset you.
Sydney, please, I'm sorry.

301
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,727
I know
it ain't for everybody.

302
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, God!

303
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,833
I loved getting
to know you!

304
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,138
All right.
Why did I tell the truth?

305
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,073
Why'd I tell her the truth?

306
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,681
What did I do that for?

307
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,309
What did I do that for?
I fucked it up.

308
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,748
I should never tell a woman the
truth, but she's so smart.

309
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,348
She's different.

310
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,492
She's different.

311
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,751
God.

312
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,195
You said it was
nice knowing me.

313
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,637
You said it was
nice to meet me.

314
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,131
Yeah.

315
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,838
Would you like to meet...

316
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:46,875
Lady Edith Greensly'?

317
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,949
I have royal banking
connections in London.

318
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,351
I'd love to help
you with your loan,

319
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:59,157
but, of course,
I have to be very selective.

320
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,526
Yeah.

321
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,997
Yes.

322
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,227
That was fucking fantastic.

323
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,166
Thank you. Did you like it?

324
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,533
I liked it.

325
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,539
I didn't think you
were coming back.

326
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,234
Thank God you came back.

327
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,537
I wasn't going anywhere.

328
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,044
I fucking love you.

329
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,004
You have me.

330
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,484
And so Irving and I began our
partnership in love and commerce.

331
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,851
Rebecca, hold on.

332
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,017
He told me to tell my friends I
had London banking connections.

333
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,060
Listen, she told me you can
get me a line of credit.

334
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,753
I heard you have banking
connections in London, England.

335
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:36,391
And after that, say "no" a lot
until the guy is hooked.

336
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,059
Rebecca, get me that
meeting, huh'? No!

337
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,192
Listen, tell her.
No.

338
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,999
I have never missed a check.
No.

339
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,930
It was almost scary
how easy it could be

340
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,043
to take money from
desperate people.

341
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,436
Lady Edith Greensly.
It's so good to see you again.

342
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,414
Lady... Your Ladyship.
Thank you. Again.

343
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,179
These are the roles
that we were meant to play.

344
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,584
We're very selective.

345
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,418
You got a strong application.
We'll talk about it.

346
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,755
I don't take a deal
that I can't close.

347
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,919
You're not being aggressive
enough in putting up your assets.

348
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,087
You ever been
to Great Neck?

349
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,630
Everybody knows
my dealerships.

350
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,631
5,000 gets me 50, right?

351
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,962
Five'll get me 35,
is that right?

352
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,229
Five grand gets me 50?

353
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,793
5,000 gets me 50, right?

354
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,704
I was doing so much
more business with her.

355
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,299
It doubled, then I! tripled.

356
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,304
And I never met anyone,
man or woman, in business,

357
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,882
who was so careful and precise
about everything,

358
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,611
every stylistic detail.

359
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,050
Congratulations.

360
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,482
We kept selling
art together, too.

361
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,419
...genre painting, which is
really rare for the time.

362
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,582
It's a boy and his dog.

363
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,819
It's a non-religious
painting...

364
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,622
16...
...55.

365
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,754
Golden Age Dutch painting.

366
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,459
Paul Klee. Expressionism.
Bauhaus Movement.

367
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,398
Before we go any further,
is this legit?

368
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,995
Let's just say, you know, it's missing
from Spain, leave it at that.

369
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,903
Don't show any
Spanish friends.

370
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:57,271
I mean, it just took off.
We got a better office,

371
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,613
we called it "London
Associates," for her accent.

372
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,321
When I was around her,
I felt joy,

373
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,756
fucking ivy!

374
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,254
And love, that's what I felt.

As far as I could see,

people were always conning each
other to get what they wanted.

386
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,003
We even con ourselves.

387
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,047
We talk ourselves
into things, you know.

388
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,609
We sell ourselves things we maybe don'!
even need or want,

389
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,915
you know, by dressing them up.

390
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,116
We leave out the risk,
we leave out the ugly truth.

391
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,260
Pay attention to that

392
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,299
'cause we're all conning
ourselves in one way or another,

393
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,595
just to get through life.

394
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,098
He was married
and he had a son.

395
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,409
Daddy!

396
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,709
He had adopted her son.

397
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,441
You're just such an artist!
Look at that!

398
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,482
He was a really good dad.

399
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,914
I respected him for that.

400
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,281
Proud! You should be so proud!

401
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,786
It was a tough
situation for everyone.

402
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,588
What'd you do today?

403
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,320
That kid Donovan
is being mean to me.

404
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,655
Thai big kid?

405
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,458
I thought Mommy
was picking you up,

406
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,157
so he couldn't bother you.

407
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,496
She was late.

408
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,126
And then after we
put out the fire,

409
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,263
Mommy said stay in my room
with my baseball cards.

410
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,830
What fire'?

411
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,639
Did you know they made a lamp
that has the sun in it?

412
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,807
Mommy got the lamp,
she made her special drink,

413
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,907
and the lamp made a fire.

414
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,084
I put out the fire.

415
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,782
The fire is out.

416
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,661
First time in my life,
I do the right thing.

417
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,629
Oh, shut up. Shut up.
No, no, no...

418
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,964
I save a young
single mother and a kid.

419
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,132
I marry her,
I adopt him...

420
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,332
You fell in love! Don't you
dare forget that part!

421
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,702
We fell madly in love.

422
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,934
Yes, I fell in love.

423
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,442
My God, I fell in love.
But you know what?

424
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,944
I thought you were
mysterious, like my mother,

425
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,343
until it turned
out that "mysterious"

426
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,506
just meant "depressed," all right'?
"Hard to reach."

427
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,140
I mean, I'm dying here.

428
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,844
And you need somebody
who's gonna be quiet,

429
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,113
who's gonna be shy,

430
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,018
you're young, you're beautiful,
you gotta find somebody else.

431
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,680
You gotta go out and get
some friends, all right?

432
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,281
I don't like going out.
You know that

433
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,452
I get anxiety when I
have to meet people.

434
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,518
You know how hard that is.

435
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,656
You cannot just slay in the
house with a fucking sun lamp.

436
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,825
All right?

437
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,132
And I cant... I mean, look, I can't
trust you with Danny when you...

438
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,330
That fire and everything...

439
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,497
I can't trust to
leave you alone.

440
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,539
I put the fire out,
Irving.

441
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,540
There is no fire.
Maybe if you were here more,

442
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,372
then there wouldn't have been
a fire in the first place.

443
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,241
Oh, what, there wouldn't have
been a fire if I was here?

444
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:52,043
Just stop with the whole fire thing!
God! It was a mistake!

445
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,741
I'm sure a million people
do that, all the time.

446
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,409
Those sun lamps
are dangerous.

447
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,817
Shouldn't even have them
in the house, really.

448
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,387
I bet that happens
all the time.

449
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,493
This was nothing.

450
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,763
We're not happy,
all right?

451
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,267
You know that I
could take Danny,

452
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,996
you know that most of
your work is illegal,

453
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,902
and you know that if you tried
to divorce me, you know that...

454
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,908
I'm not saying that I would,
but I'm saying that I could,

455
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,036
and I'm saying that that is why
I don't like divorce, Irving.

456
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,512
Women do that in divorces.

457
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,448
Women get the children and then
the fathers never see them.

458
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,341
My mother never got divorced.

459
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,784
My grandmother
never got divorced.

460
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,411
There are no
divorces in my family.

461
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,217
I am not getting a divorce.

462
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,417
Come on,
what are we doing here?

463
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,517
We fight and we fuck and that's what we do.
That's our thing.

464
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,086
She was the Picasso
of passive-aggressive karate.

465
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,129
Come here. Come here.

466
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,134
She was better than any con
artist I ever met, including myself,

467
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,534
and she had me
like nobody had me.

468
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,036
Irving, come to mama,
come on.

469
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,938
You might say she was my karma

470
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,601
for how I took
advantage of people.

471
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,700
Irving...

472
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,811
Oh, my God.

473
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,440
Come here. Come on.

474
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,607
Get into bed.

475
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:02,708
All right.

476
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,618
Baby,
there's such good stuff here.

477
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,122
I did not want
to leave the kid behind.

478
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,748
He was my son!

479
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,294
She had me. I was her mark.

480
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,161
Now, I can't assure you that
your loan will be approved,

481
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:19,464
but I can tell you that
any deal Hake, I close.

482
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,971
However,
my fee is nonrefundable,

483
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,564
just like my time.

484
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,976
I want to thank you very
much, Irving, for seeing me.

485
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,638
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

486
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,907
Is that...
Am I not buttoned?

487
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,349
I just got to say, Mr. Rosenfeld,
that Lady Edith was

488
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,984
very adamant that
you were top-notch.

489
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,286
That's correct.

490
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,759
I really need your help,
I'm desperate.

491
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,960
I mean, I got the Audis

492
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,090
and two boats,
and I forgot to mention

493
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,260
that I have a little piece
of real estate in Long Island.

494
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,428
No, you didn't mention that.

495
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,631
Two lunches and you
never mentioned that.

496
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,837
I was gonna mention it, then the
guy with the hat walked in.

497
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,137
The hat'?
You remember that?

498
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,679
I forgot, I totally...
I do remember.

499
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,712
It was the second
time we had lunch.

500
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,043
Yes.

501
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,708
I thought he was...
You couldn't see his eyes.

502
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,217
It was like he had no eyes.

503
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,945
Do they sell hats like that?
I don't know.

504
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,455
It's like he made it.
Where do they come from?

505
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,524
He's a great milliner.
Actually, I went to the store.

506
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,785
I saw a hat store
down the street.

507
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,018
I thought maybe
he bought it there,

508
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,027
and I was gonna get you one,
as, like, a memento.

509
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,995
- Two lunches?
- Yes.

510
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,464
Really?
It's two lunches.

511
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,330
What's the big deal?
That's unusual.

512
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,370
I was trying to get him
to be more aggressive.

513
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,528
On his loan, that is.

514
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,129
You showed me a whole new side of
the city I'd never seen before.

515
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,230
Yeah, it's...

516
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,536
You're welcome.

517
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,577
No. Thank you.

518
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,905
Yeah, right.
Should I take you there?

519
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,504
Yeah, it's nice.
You liked it?

520
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,174
All right, should I
take you there twice?

521
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,582
Stop.-

522
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,347
What are you doing?
What?

523
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,359
You like this guy?
Yes, I like this guy.

524
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,723
Is this messing
with your judgement?

525
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,022
No, it's not
messing with my judgement.

526
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,825
Don't be stupid.
Hey, hey, hey.

527
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,921
Look at me.

528
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,431
Play your part.

529
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,229
Fine, you play your part.

530
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,894
Well, take it to
your people in London.

531
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,995
Please, take it to them.

532
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,067
I got the cashier's
check right here.

533
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,271
I give you five, and you
give me 50 back, right?

534
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,610
Please.

535
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,581
Please don't reject me.

536
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,120
Give a guy a chance.

537
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,523
Zurich?
You got an office in Zurich?

538
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,893
Paris? I can call Paris.

539
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:30,933
Excuse me for a second.

540
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,024
Yeah, take your time.
Excuse me.

541
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,263
Yeah. It's...
Just be one moment.

542
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,860
Do whatever you need to do.

543
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,430
Go ahead, take your time.

544
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:39,965
Stick around
for a little bit.

545
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,238
See my friend over here?

546
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,473
I'm not moving anywhere,
all right?

547
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,310
You got the wrong office,
you're gonna be embarrassed.

548
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,542
I don't think so.

549
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,051
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, go easy on her.

550
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,213
I may not have you, Irving,
but I have her on fraud.

551
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,880
Impersonating another individual.
On fraud?

552
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,549
On fraud? What is that'?
Yeah, she may not be...

553
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,614
Identity fraud?

554
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,955
You may be from England,
but you're not royal,

555
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,256
and you have no
banking connections,

556
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,954
and that's a felony. You
don't have to cuff me up.

557
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,225
How long is that?
That's three to five years.

558
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,925
Hey, not so...
Oh, really?

559
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,435
That's interesting.
I don't even know your name.

560
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,597
Richie DiMaso, FBI.
Nice to meet you.

561
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,903
You got to get
away from this guy.

562
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,012
He wouldn't let me
see her for three days.

563
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,107
Even managed to
delay her lawyer.

564
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,583
She couldn't handle it.

565
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,421
How come the fluorescents are on?
Can we kill that, please?

566
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,330
Jesus Christ,
I put this lamp here for you

567
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,662
'cause I thought it
would be better for you.

568
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,997
There's a wire here,
they're scared

569
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,332
because people
hang themselves,

570
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,337
but I know you're
too smart for that.

571
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,874
Where's the table and chair?
There's no bed here?

572
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,376
It's like a fucking asylum.
Joe, is everybody off today?

573
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,946
Jesus Christ, it's scary.

574
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,447
Maybe I wanted to scare
you, I don't know.

575
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,675
Maybe it was my idea.

576
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,682
Maybe I'm a little
off the beaten path.

577
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,047
You know,
I don't know, maybe.

578
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,279
Hey, you look dehydrated.

579
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,379
Here,
you want to have some tea?

580
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,318
Yeah,
your lips are all chapped.

581
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,352
It's herbal.

582
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,396
It's my favorite.

583
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,396
I know you think...
Look at me.

584
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,472
Hey, Edith, I know
you think Irv loves you.

585
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,336
I know you think
you know him.

586
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:25,342
You think that he sees the world
as this cold, dark place,

587
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,408
and he cares about nobody but a
very few people on a shortlist.

588
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,077
His son,
his father, Rosalyn and you.

589
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,813
And you think you're
on the top of that list.

590
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,553
What if you're not? What if
you're not on that list?

591
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,991
What if you're not
even on that list at all?

592
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,229
He'd be in here right now
if he took the check,

593
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,993
but no, you did.

594
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,762
God, it's so clear to me.

595
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,564
It's so... It's clear to me,
but it's not clear to you.

596
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,935
He uses you,
Edith, to protect himself,

597
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,770
to protect his son
and his wife in Long Island.

598
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,573
No? Yes,
he put a ring on her finger.

599
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,341
He adopted her son.

600
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,848
They have a huge house,
they have two cars.

601
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,748
What does she do all day?
I'll tell you what she does.

602
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,410
She plays with her nails,
she watches TV,

603
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,385
and she spends your money,
the money that you make.

604
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,527
I don't like that you're in
jail while he's going free.

605
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,028
I don't like any of that.
I want to help you.

606
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,264
All the razzle-dazzle
that he does,

607
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,266
it's not good, it's not real,
it's fake, it's not real.

608
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,099
Who you are is who you are,
between you and God,

609
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,399
you and your soul.
That's what matters.

610
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,407
That's what counts,
that's what I'm about,

611
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,635
and that's what I see in you.

612
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,711
Tell me you didn't feel it the
first time we saw each other.

613
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,643
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

614
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,210
I'm not supposed
to be talking like this,

615
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,308
but I don't care,
I'll break the rules.

616
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,883
Okay, Edith, Edith,
I want to help you.

617
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,217
I like you.

618
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,915
I like you.

619
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,485
I like you.

620
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,901
Been in there three days.

621
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,736
Hasn't been so good for her.

622
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,414
How's that make you feel,
her in there?

623
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,646
That check
was for you, right?

624
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,515
But you knew
something was off.

625
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,321
It's 'cause you're good. You're,
like, the best at what you do

626
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,120
in the whole country,
aren't you?

627
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,760
But you know what,
if the country were run

628
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,192
by people like you,
Irving Rosenfeld,

629
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,924
we'd be living in Eastern
Europe or Guatemala.

630
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,332
You ever been to Guatemala? You
ever been in jail in Guatemala?

631
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,530
You ever try to get a telephone or
a permit or anything in Guatemala?

632
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,662
That's what this
country would be like

633
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,968
if we let people that are liars
like you run this country.

634
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,608
Who made you God
and judge, huh?

635
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,374
My grandmother lived to be 93 years
old, never lied in her life.

636
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,607
Congratulations.

637
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:39,774
Thank you.

638
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,681
I'm proud of that, too.

639
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,774
Does that make her
not a good person?

640
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,184
Is that not
something to strive for?

641
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,313
Why you
breaking my balls, huh?

642
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,448
Get to the point.

643
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:51,025
I see something in you, Irving.
I get very excited.

644
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,357
I think that we have
a lot of potential here.

645
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,456
Now, look,
I came up with the idea.

646
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,467
It's all from me,
I want to change things.

647
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,025
I want to go after
white-collar crime.

648
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,002
Irving, you're very skilled,

649
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,062
and I want you to teach me,
and we can do this.

650
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,505
I want four people
that do what you do.

651
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,044
Fraudulent investments,
fake certificates of deposit,

652
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,203
stolen art, fake art.

653
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,372
You get me four people,
and you're off the hook.

654
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,813
Four busts,

655
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,883
and you leave us alone?

656
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,817
We don't have to testify?

657
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,152
You're good, you're done.
Anything you want.

658
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,721
But if you run,
then your life's over.

659
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,385
You're gonna be hunted, and
it's gonna be very difficult

660
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,088
for Rosalyn and your kid
to live in this country.

661
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,002
We need to leave. We need
to run, and we need to do it now.

662
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,231
Right, we'll go to Estonia
or Romania, I don't care,

663
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,431
but we'll take
the cash from the bed,

664
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,665
and get out of here,
all right?

665
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:39,001
We've talked
about it 100 times.

666
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,600
What about Danny?

667
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,270
I adopted him,
I gave him my name.

668
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,745
I'm not leaving
him with Rosalyn.

669
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,509
She's unstable.
That is a manipulation.

670
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,948
Rosalyn will never let you go.

671
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,381
She'll use Danny
against you because

672
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,921
she's too messed
up to let you leave.

673
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,352
I can't leave him.
I love him, all right?

674
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,522
He's my son.

675
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,095
Richie said you
would say that.

676
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,427
Richie?
Yeah.

677
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,627
What, the cop? You're on a
first-name basis with him?

678
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:06,930
Yes, I am. I'm not
even on your list, am I?

679
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,264
What list'?

680
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,533
Your list, your short list, your long list.
I'm not even on any one

681
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,597
of your fucking lists. I don't
know what you're talking about.

682
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:13,641
I thought you loved me.
I love you.

683
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,802
I thought that
we had something.

684
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,037
We do have something,
it's perfect.

685
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,102
What are you saying?

686
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,545
We're gonna go to Romania,
we're gonna take Danny.

687
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,604
Yes.
Is that what you're saying?

688
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,944
Yes, that's
what I'm saying.

689
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,780
You, me, Danny, yes.
Really?

690
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,916
Well, you never said that before.
Well, I'm saying it now.

691
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,479
We're us, we can make it
an adventure like we did.

692
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,287
We can make it an adventure like
we make everything, all right?

693
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,884
All right.
Okay?

694
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,224
We have to go now,
all right?

695
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,992
Trust me,
we have to leave right now.

696
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,092
I can't leave Danny,
I'll lose custody.

697
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,327
No, you have
to take me away.

698
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,629
I can't.
We have to leave.

699
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,930
No, what are you saying?
What are you doing?

700
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,835
What are you saying?
Please!

701
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,104
Oh, my God.
Will you pull it together?

702
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,074
I can't believe
this is happening.

703
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,743
Don't say I don't love you.
That's bullshit.

704
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,476
This is bullshit.

705
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,574
We are bullshit.

706
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,410
You are bullshit.

707
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,688
You are bullshit.

708
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,259
Please don't do this.

709
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,155
I just never thought
that you were conning me.

710
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,992
I could never con you.

711
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,433
I love you.

712
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,599
Please don't say this.

713
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,775
Babe.

714
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,948
No, I'm done.

715
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,681
Don't say that.

716
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,879
I'm gonna do these four busts,
these four cons,

717
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,115
to get us out of this,
not just me, but us.

718
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:41,789
And I'm gonna get really close
with Richie the cop

719
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,494
in case we need to use him,
if we need another move.

720
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,497
We don't need
another move.

721
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,698
We need four busts,

722
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,898
then we're done.

723
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,540
We are gonna
need another move.

724
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,702
Trust me, and you're
gonna be thanking me.

725
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,211
The key
to people is what they believe

726
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,043
and what they
want to believe.

727
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,582
So I want to believe that we were real.
We are real.

728
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,483
And I want to believe
that a man could want me,

729
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,420
and I'm gonna take
all of that heartbreak

730
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,549
and all of that sorrow,
and lam going to use it,

731
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,991
and I am going to
make Richie think

732
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,722
that I want him

733
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,592
and that I like him.

734
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,828
And I'm gonna be very,
very convincing.

735
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,839
And I'm pissed at you.

736
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,500
'Cause I am pissed at you.

737
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,241
Maybe I do like him.

738
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,848
Maybe I like him a lot.

739
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,019
From the feet up, right?

740
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,357
Baby.

741
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,759
Quit your bellyaching and
come up with something

742
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,460
to get us out of this.

743
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,538
And you're right, I'm in no
state to deal with this.

744
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,074
So what's it gonna be,
Mr. Mastermind?

745
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:02,901
An Arab sheik?

746
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,437
What do we want
an Arab sheik for?

747
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,782
Well, how do you
think this works' stupid?

748
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,376
If you could not call him
stupid, which he isn't.

749
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,786
He's smarter than you.

750
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,448
Last time I checked, he's in
control and we work for him now,

751
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,220
so be nice, okay?

752
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,826
Okay.

753
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,592
To set this up,
to bust the con artist,

754
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,835
we need to make the honeypot
to attract the bees.

755
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,308
To attract the bees,
we need to offer them

756
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,310
a wealthy individual who
they can take advantage of.

757
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,905
Someone special, someone
new, someone amazing.

758
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,816
And those guys
are going to want to sell

759
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,318
fake bank
CDs to that guy.

760
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,320
Take the sheik's money,
you see?

761
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,017
Only they can't get into his
money unless they know someone,

762
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,651
and that someone is us.
Oh, that's good.

763
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,093
So, if you want
to get somebody like

764
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,291
your con artist friend,
Carl Elway,

765
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,526
you get him to
want to buy or sell...

766
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,828
Keep your voice down.

767
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,369
Sell fake art or stolen art
or fake certificates of deposit,

768
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,336
he needs, who does he need?
He needs a rich sheik-guy,

769
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,600
and there you go,
we can pinch him.

770
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,667
That's right, that's right,
but I don't tell Elway shit.

771
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,837
I wait for him to call me.

772
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,437
The art world
is a small world,

773
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:16,213
and one of Elway's acquaintances
is clocking us right now.

774
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,481
Where?
Don't look. Don't look.

775
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,022
You have a good look?

776
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,128
How do you know
the sheik?

777
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,467
This is my friend Al,
from Queens.

778
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,467
I do aluminum
siding and roofing.

779
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,707
I want to show you something.

780
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,969
This Rembrandt here,

781
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,478
people come from all over
the world to see this.

782
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,905
Yeah, he's good. Yeah.

783
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,913
It's a fake.

784
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,680
What? What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

785
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,252
People believe what
they want to believe.

786
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,815
'Cause the guy who
made this was so good

787
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,488
that it's real
to everybody.

788
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,560
Now, who's the master?

789
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,199
The painter
or the forger?

790
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,031
That's a fake?

791
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,338
That's the
way the world works.

792
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,767
Not black-and-white,
like you say.

793
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,009
Extremely gray.

794
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,748
Irving, could I...

795
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,249
Arthur, how many
times I got to tell you?

796
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,443
You can't meet the sheik,
all right?

797
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,576
Could I please meet him sometime?
Carl can't meet him.

798
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:25,882
Not yet. Another time.

799
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,924
Arthur. Hi.
Come on.

800
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,252
Edith.
Edith, hi.

801
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,384
Yes, I wanted to introduce
you to Robert Spencer.

802
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,360
We're advising
the sheik together.

803
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,260
Thank you.
Robert Spencer.

804
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,923
Advisor to the sheik.
Yeah.

805
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,392
What's this about
a goddamn sheik?

806
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,698
Why are you leaving
me out of this? Huh?

807
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,433
I got to hear it
from my friends?

808
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,302
It ain't for you, Carl. What
do you mean, it ain't for me?

809
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,739
Nah, it ain't for you.
What are you talking about?

810
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,436
We got to do
certificates of deposit

811
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,603
I can print as
many as you need.

812
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:50,975
I got my associates here.
What do you mean, guys'?

813
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,776
Come on. This is not
a one-man operation.

814
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,748
Look, I can get other guys. What
are you talking about, Irving?

815
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,318
I can get other guys. You're
telling me that you can

816
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:00,287
get four guys to sell
fake certificates of deposit

817
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,790
to my investor
within a week?

818
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,451
Yes, I can
make that happen.

819
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,893
Carl Elway can do
what he says he's going to do.

820
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,259
That's interesting,
but, you know,

821
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,627
I got other guys lined up.
I got a meeting.

822
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,901
Here, look, these are my associates.
I got to run.

823
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,265
- Carl, his associates are here.
- Don't go.

824
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,998
He's got a meeting he's got to go to.
Listen, don't go...

825
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,629
I got to run. No, don't go...
No, don't go.

826
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,833
Crazy thing about people,

827
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,501
the more you say no, the more
they want in on something.

828
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,634
Yeah, they're so stupid.

829
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,805
I got to run. Come on.

830
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,746
I'll tell them. Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll tell...

831
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,478
Hey, you know what
Carl just told me?

832
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:32,487
He said he could do this whole thing
with four guys within a week.

833
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,988
Or we could do something much bigger.
All right.

834
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,489
Something bigger?
Yeah, my guy deals

835
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,752
with hundreds of
millions of dollars.

836
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,123
How much bigger?
Hundreds of...

837
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,992
I knew you were
holding out on me, Irving!

838
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,428
Hundreds of millions of dollars?
Like, much bigger.

839
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,331
Like, I'm talking about, we could
say never the fuck mind the CDs,

840
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,460
and we could have some complete
access to something huge.

841
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,765
RICHIE; Huge? Like what'?

842
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,500
Robert Spencer.
I'm adviser to the sheik.

843
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,006
Carl Elway.

844
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,837
I want you to think of
the most undervalued asset

845
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,843
in the state of
New Jersey today.

846
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,807
The rebuilding
of Atlantic City.

847
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,440
Look, maybe they... Maybe
they legalized gambling

848
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,611
a year ago...
Wow.

849
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,018
...and nothings happening.

850
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,679
Hey.
No licenses, no permits.

851
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,189
Quit while
you're ahead, Carl.

852
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,849
I know the guy...
I know the right people

853
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,359
who are going to help you out.
Who's the guy?

854
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,292
The guy is Carmine Polito.

855
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,887
Who's Carmine Polito?

856
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,056
Carmine Polito?

857
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:17,956
Carmine Polito, no.

858
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,466
My boss, Stoddard,
proceeded to tell me

859
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,538
that Carmine Polito was the
most quietly powerful person

860
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,005
in the state of New Jersey.

861
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:28,044
A lifetime native of the
very racially mixed Camden,

862
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,702
which had become a ghetto.

863
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,974
And where he had been
mayor for ten years.

864
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,811
A very beloved guy.

865
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,681
A guy who never
gave up on his people.

866
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,878
His father had emigrated from
Italy and had stoked coal.

867
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,313
A big family guy
with five kids.

868
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,324
They even adopted some
other kid, a black kid

869
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,388
from the Boys and Girls Club
who'd lost his family.

870
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,331
I mean, his household
was a joyous place.

871
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,428
And his wife, Dolly, well,
she was the apple of his eye.

872
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:59,039
And the center
of the household.

873
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,600
I mean,
everyone loved this guy.

874
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,010
And he had a huge heart.

875
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,883
The WPA employed craftsmen
to paint this during the Depression.

876
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,547
Why can't we
employ people today

877
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,420
to do work like this
in rebuilding Atlantic City?

878
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,083
He worked with all the unions,

879
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,888
he was the leader of
the State Assembly,

880
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,520
and he had just
gotten gambling legalized

881
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,587
in New Jersey to create jobs.

882
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,531
But he couldn't get the funds
to rebuild Atlantic City.

883
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,032
And that was his problem.

884
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,538
So, with our help,
he was about to have his hand

885
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,541
in the wrong pocket
at the wrong time.

886
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,770
And to me, that meant corrupt.

887
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,312
You said grifters,
con artists.

888
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,246
We're not going
after some politician.

889
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,148
This is a bad idea, Richard.

890
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,878
Look, it's really simple.

891
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,583
All you need is to put two
million in a Chase account...

892
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,386
What?
...under the sheik's name.

893
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,790
Whose $2 million?

894
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,759
Just listen.

895
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,388
$2 million under
the sheik's name

896
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,662
in a Chase account
that we control.

897
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:02,169
Carmine calls up
on the telephone,

898
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,139
calls the bank and he sees
that the sheik is real

899
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,674
and he has a real account.

900
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,471
Five days.

901
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,513
I'm not taking $2 million
of the taxpayers' money,

902
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,604
putting it anywhere
for five days.

903
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,150
I don't care if we
control it the whole time.

904
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,152
Stoddard, let us do what we need
to do to rule out corruption

905
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,347
and to get rid
of the payoff guys

906
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,482
that are ruining this country.
That's my dream.

907
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,287
Don't smother it, please.
You know, Richard,

908
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,657
I understand your eagerness.

909
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,320
I really do.

910
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,125
You know I'm from Michigan,
right?

911
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,632
Let me tell you a story

912
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,759
about me and my
dad and my brother.

913
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,963
We used to go ice
fishing every November.

914
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,164
Ice fishing,
that's all anybody...

915
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,466
That's what we lived for.

916
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,007
Holy shit.
Just listen to me.

917
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,667
It's beautiful.
You have a little stove.

918
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,676
You huddle around,
you keep each other warm.

919
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,145
You drop a line
and you just wait.

920
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,183
One year,
my brother says,

921
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,511
"Let's go in October."

922
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,176
He wants to go
ice fishing in October.

923
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,117
My dad says,
"No, the ice is too thin."

924
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,951
My brother says,
I love my brother, he says...

925
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,455
I understand. Your brother
went out on the ice,

926
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,015
the ice was too thin,
he fell through the ice,

927
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,822
he went in the water
'cause he was too eager,

928
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,556
and you're saying I'm too eager.
That's what you're saying?

929
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,857
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

930
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,296
What are you saying?

931
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,697
You know,
we'll finish the ice story

932
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,860
another time, young man.

933
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,029
For now, no Carmine Polito.

934
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:10,868
Go do your job.

935
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,339
Stoddard shot
the whole thing down.

936
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,808
Boring.

937
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,370
But Edith was a genius.

938
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,139
Yeah, you take me to Brenda.

939
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,842
She somehow found this woman
who controlled the wire room.

940
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,317
A woman I'd
never even heard of.

941
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,877
She's amazing. She's in charge
of all the wire transfers.

942
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:29,015
Way back in a warren
buried in the Bureau.

943
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,491
She likes cats.

944
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,994
This cat lady no one
ever even talked to.

945
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,363
And Edith met her in the ladies'
room and became friends with her.

946
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,163
Brenda? Hi.

947
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,827
Hello.
How are you?

948
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,496
RICHIE; This lady
handled all the wires,

949
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,903
and now she was
working with us.

950
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,498
She was excited to be
included in an operation

951
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,009
instead of just being
on the other end of a memo.

952
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,511
You said you liked
exotic booze, so...

953
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,739
It was beautiful.
That's from England.

954
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,371
This is from England?
Yeah.

955
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,178
That's right. And I brought
you some tea as well.

956
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,546
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, nobody

957
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,244
ever talks to me.
I know.

958
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,582
I mean, they just say, "Brenda,
do the clerical wiring stuff

959
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,213
"and don't ask questions."

960
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,724
You need to tell
Richie about your cats.

961
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,884
Oh, my cats?
He loves cats.

962
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,120
Oh, my cats?
Yeah.

963
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,286
Well, that's Harry.

964
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,523
Look at him standing up!
Isn't that sweet?

965
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,226
And that's Wendy.
She's a rascal.

966
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,269
But Barnaby,
that's another story.

967
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,200
Barnaby plays the piano.

968
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,296
That's impressive.

969
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,968
We got her to wire $2 million into
an FBI-controlled account at Chase.

970
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:24,478
It'd be there for five days,
and if Polito called,

971
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,310
he'd see that
the sheik was real.

972
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,213
And by the time
Stoddard caught up to us,

973
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,912
Edith made sure his boss
was impressed by my idea.

974
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,648
So, before he even
knew it was happening,

975
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,484
his boss was calling
to congratulate him,

976
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,718
The sheik with the money
in the bank is a...

977
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,722
Anthony Amado. He had a major
hard-on to make a name for himself.

978
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,663
I mean, this guy loved the
idea of being famous.

979
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,097
Don't be modest.

980
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,931
And Stoddard had to say

981
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,631
it was his own idea or he'd look
stupid in front of his boss.

982
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,230
You made me accept praise
from my boss for thanking me

983
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,798
for something that
never should have happened,

984
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,400
something that I
didn't approve.

985
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,139
You should be happy.

986
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,237
There's imaginative things
happening in this office.

987
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,579
All right? We're not
just working in a box.

988
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,916
We got the $2 million to put
Carmine and the sheik together.

989
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,181
Punk.

990
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,416
I liked being on
this side of the line.

991
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,320
But someone had been left out.

992
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,325
We succeeded
because we stayed small.

993
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,987
I got you Carl Elway.

994
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,033
He bought stolen an,
sold fake bank CD's.

995
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,658
That's enough.
That's one.

996
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,759
I get you three more,
no politicians.

997
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,337
You're going to do this

998
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,668
because you got no choice,
you work for me.

999
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,436
Now, you keep
changing the rules.

1000
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,705
You know, you're getting
a little power-drunk, Richard.

1001
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,609
You want to tell him, Edith?
You want to wake him up?

1002
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,512
Oh, no. I said we shouldn't
do any of it, Irving,

1003
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,845
you know I said that,
so now I support Richie.

1004
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,977
He's got vision.
Do it heavy or don't do it.

1005
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,453
Wait. What does
that mean?

1006
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,012
I mean, he's the one
ruining America, not me.

1007
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,682
How the fuck am I
ruining America?

1008
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,226
Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, all right,

1009
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,626
and you're going to shit all
over politicians again?

1010
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,790
And just because you want to be
a big shot, get a promotion.

1011
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,856
No. I'm thinking big, all right?

1012
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,299
This is going
to be fantastic.

1013
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,529
We're doing
video surveillance.

1014
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,195
I'm doing this
from the feet up.

1015
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:57,671
You will never
do it properly

1016
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,207
because you got too much
government attitude

1017
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,708
to be small and sleek.

1018
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,709
I'm like the fucking
Vietcong, man, all right?

1019
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,006
I'm in and I'm out.

1020
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,342
I was there the whole time.

1021
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,041
You don't know it,
all right?

1022
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,209
That's the fucking
art of becoming somebody

1023
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:13,221
who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on.

1024
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,086
And you can't do it.

1025
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,051
How about a suite
at the Sheraton Hotel?

1026
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,559
For Carmine Polito

1027
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,185
and rebuilding Atlantic City...
Why not?

1028
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,322
...you need a luxury hotel for the sheik.
Oh, come on.

1029
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,727
Carmine does backdoor dealings all the time.
We don't have a...

1030
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,495
We don't got
a budget for that, Irving.

1031
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,730
You got to knock the mayor,

1032
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,396
the speaker of
the State Assembly,

1033
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,202
you got to knock him off of
his fucking feet, all right?

1034
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,834
He's got to feel like
he's out of his league.

1035
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,742
What you're offering,
this deal,

1036
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,246
I mean, this is unheard of
in the state of New Jersey,

1037
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,010
maybe even the whole
fucking country, all right?

1038
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,382
A sheik with hundreds
of millions of dollars

1039
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,251
to rebuild Atlantic City,
are you fucking kidding me'?

1040
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,914
That's gigantic, all right?

1041
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,083
And the mayor, he's going
to want to see cash,

1042
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,183
he's going to want to
see it in an account,

1043
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,924
he's going to want to see it
right now, and he will check.

1044
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,692
And that's why this
meeting isn't happening.

1045
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,531
Because to get millions,
you need millions.

1046
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,367
We already did it.

1047
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,406
What?

1048
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,878
We got the Bureau to park
$2 million for three days.

1049
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,040
We've got
the account numbers.

1050
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,743
"We" meaning you and him?

1051
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,114
Yeah, we did it.

1052
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,744
Really?

1053
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,116
Yeah, me and that guy.

1054
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:21,451
She showed me.

1055
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,116
You showed him our thing?

1056
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,717
You did that without me?

1057
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,592
Are you kidding?

1058
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,893
What are you going to do?

1059
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,502
You playing me?

1060
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,673
Are you doing this?
You playing him?

1061
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:50,116
It'd be very bad for
you if you're playing me.

1062
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,017
You're going to have to
decide for yourself, kid.

1063
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,521
I just laid everything
out on the table.

1064
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,490
It's all very exciting.

1065
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,425
I didn't know life
could be like this.

1066
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,500
You're pretty wild.

1067
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,004
You know,
we're taking down a...

1068
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,450
A very important
politician.

1069
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:23,949
Mmm-hmm.

1070
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,522
This is Agent Richard DiMaso.

1071
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:13,497
I'm placing
$75, 000 in this briefcase

1072
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,367
for Mayor Carmine Polito
to procure casino license

1073
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:19,271
and building permits
for Atlantic City.

1074
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:28,548
What is this? What...

1075
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,608
Look, I don't know you.
Excuse me, I don't...

1076
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,221
I don't know what that is,
but this is very weird to me.

1077
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,188
This is very weird. I don't know
what the fuck that is, but...

1078
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,748
Go out there and get him now.

1079
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,590
Mr. Mayor!

1080
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,062
Please stop. Listen.

1081
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,929
I apologize if that
prick offended you.

1082
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,695
I really apologize. Hey,
I'm all right, thank you.

1083
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,429
I'm okay. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm fucking embarrassed

1084
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:50,267
to be associated with that guy at all.
It's okay.

1085
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:52,102
Can I just say
something to you, please?

1086
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:55,609
Don't lose this opportunity
to fucking Florida, all right,

1087
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,441
because of some bullshit

1088
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,743
from that punk advisor,
all right,

1089
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,409
with his "diploma,"
all right,

1090
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,953
who could never get into
the school that we come from.

1091
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,215
Don't lose
that opportunity.

1092
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,286
Where you from?

1093
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,327
I'm from the Bronx.

1094
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,590
Grand Concourse,
164th Street.

1095
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,298
I got a lot of friends
that live up there.

1096
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,994
Yeah, I go
to Tomaso's on...

1097
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,661
Yeah, Tomaso's. Yeah, yeah.
You know Tomaso's

1098
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,171
on Arthur Avenue? Yeah,
I love the clams there.

1099
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,002
The clam, the spicy clams.
Yes. Oh, so good.

1100
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,768
Oh, they're fucking to die
for, those things. Yeah.

1101
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:30,005
Yeah, I haven't been there in a while.
I like that place.

1102
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,073
Well, you know what?

1103
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,946
Tell me,
can I call you Carmine?

1104
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,749
You know, Carmine,

1105
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,845
hey, my fucking heart's going
from running down the stairs.

1106
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:41,685
I'm not used to running.

1107
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,625
There's a lot of green grass
in that hotel room up there,

1108
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,493
all right, and all the deals
would float through you.

1109
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,361
You get a serious piece
on both ends, all right?

1110
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,865
You do with it
what you will.

1111
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,697
I mean, I live in
the real world, all right?

1112
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,532
I am a family man.
I got mouths to feed

1113
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,435
and everything like that,
but, you know, you got...

1114
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,499
We just... We got to
grease you directly.

1115
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:02,635
No middlemen, no bullshit,
it's the Arab way.

1116
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,872
That's it.
That's ii. All right?

1117
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,641
Yeah, look, I understand.

1118
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,341
It's a great opportunity.

1119
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,042
You understand, it's just...
I got a little thrown

1120
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,880
by going to have a meeting
with somebody that ended up

1121
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,545
not being there, so...

1122
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,020
I was thrown as well.
No, look, I understand.

1123
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,681
I'll deal with you directly.

1124
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,816
I don't want any middleman
or any of that bullshit.

1125
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:19,691
Done. Done. You and me.
Deal with you directly.

1126
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,854
I like you, eye to eye,
we can do business together.

1127
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,158
That's fine.

1128
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:24,561
Yeah, how long you
known this guy?

1129
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,498
I mean, you work
with this guy before?

1130
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,468
I got to work with him. It's the
sheik, all right, you know...

1131
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,869
But I still need to
meet the sheik, okay?

1132
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,371
Yeah. Done.
After you.

1133
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:32,964
I'm going out for dinner

1134
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,134
with Carmine and
the wives in Camden.

1135
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,232
Who?

1136
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,243
Carmine and
myself and the wives.

1137
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,335
What? Without me?

1138
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,382
He doesn't like you.
What do you want from me?

1139
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,417
I got him to come
back and take the money.

1140
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,985
You got him on tape,
all right?

1141
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,748
I mean,
I can't make him like you.

1142
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:47,823
You know, I mean...
I did my job.

1143
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,357
Did you tell him that
you were working with me?

1144
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,915
That I'm
the sheik's associate?

1145
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,886
I just fucking told you,
he doesn't like you.

1146
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:54,826
I mean,
let him have a night out

1147
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,489
with a human being,
for fuck's sake, all right?

1148
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,227
He's going to jail soon.
You're done with him.

1149
00:50:58,322 --> 00:50:59,824
You got him
on tape taking a bribe.

1150
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,170
Carmine has got
to deal with me, Irving.

1151
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:04,363
We're going to use Carmine. Yeah,
no, we're gonna get Carmine's...

1152
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,271
We're gonna use Carmine
to get other people.

1153
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,569
That's what we're gonna do.

1154
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:08,769
What? Like who?

1155
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:11,039
Carmine's going to use
the sheik to pay off people.

1156
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,012
You fucking nuts'? What are you...
Are you fuck...

1157
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,107
We're going to let
Carmine show the sheik

1158
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,242
Atlantic City, how he's
going to renovate hotels,

1159
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:18,786
and see who shows up and

1160
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,254
whoever the sheik pays off
for licenses and casinos,

1161
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:22,722
that's who we're
going to go after.

1162
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,690
We're going to go
after all of them.

1163
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,283
More politicians?

1164
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,520
Yeah.

1165
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,619
You realize how
fucking dangerous that is?

1166
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,356
There's no fucking
reasoning with you.

1167
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,765
All right, Edith and I were
so successful for so long

1168
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,426
because we kept it
just small enough.

1169
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,438
You are taking us to a very
fucking dangerous place,

1170
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:39,735
with very serious numbers!

1171
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,605
If you were that successful,
how come you wound up

1172
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:45,044
in this room with me right
now, taking orders from me?

1173
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,480
You're taking your
wife out to dinner?

1174
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,778
Your fucking wife? Did I
just hear you correctly?

1175
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,944
That's the one thing
you heard me say.

1176
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,044
I just find it rather
shocking. That's all.

1177
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,387
I get to handle two
wives with one dinner.

1178
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,621
All right? I take Rosalyn out,
she keeps her mouth shut,

1179
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:02,459
she sees that my work is
legitimate, I get to keep my kid

1180
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,760
and I get to keep
that fucking wife happy.

1181
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,597
Both wives happy.

1182
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,178
Richard, what are you doing'?

1183
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,679
Richard,
don't eat in the bathroom!

1184
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:25,310
I told you so many times!

1185
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,150
And Diane brought napoleons.

1186
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,485
Come out of
the bathroom and pray!

1187
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,821
Oh, my God,
what did you do'?

1188
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,452
Richard, the filter is
broken in the fish tank.

1189
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:35,826
It's a problem.

1190
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,296
See, your job is to
do the filter, Mom.

1191
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,594
Mine is to do the gravel.

1192
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:42,661
When you don't do the filter
right, all the fish die. See?

1193
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,104
I can't get that top on the
filter, that thing on there.

1194
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,607
We went over
this 100 times, Mom.

1195
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,940
And please help Richard
to marry Diane so that I

1196
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,275
may have grandchildren and the
Pope may have more followers.

1197
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,042
And please bless this food

1198
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,515
that we are about to eat.

1199
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:56,607
Richard!

1200
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:57,880
Yeah, hello?

1201
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,382
Hi.

1202
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:00,853
Who's this?

1203
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,355
It's Edith.

1204
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,119
Sit down and pray properly!

1205
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,024
Are you all right?

1206
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,491
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1207
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,360
I'm just...
I'm alone, you know.

1208
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,057
Irving's out with Carmine.

1209
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:15,395
Oh, yeah, that's right, he went
outwith Carmine and his wife.

1210
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,904
Yeah, you must not
feel so good about that.

1211
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,372
Richard, sit down.

1212
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:20,965
Wait. Who's that'?
Who are you with?

1213
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,635
Oh, no, it's just people.

1214
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,237
"People"?
I'm your fiancée. Richard!

1215
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,838
Oh, you've got a fiancée.
You're engaged.

1216
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,543
I don't know, I don't know.
No fiancée.

1217
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,017
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

1218
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:33,681
You don't know'? You don't
know if you have a fiancée?

1219
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,690
The fish filter is broken!

1220
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,191
Hmm. Interesting.

1221
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,249
What, you want...
You want to get together?

1222
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,989
Richard, do
something about the fish tank.

1223
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,255
54th Street?

1224
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,425
Okay, 54th Street.

1225
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,002
Okay. Great.

1226
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,596
That's what that
phone call was about

1227
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,106
Everybody thought,
"Oh, Richie DiMaso's

1228
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:55,177
"going to stay in
the office pushing papers."

1229
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,506
That's not going
to happen, Mom.

1230
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,739
I'm outside in the field.

1231
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,610
I got people working for me.

1232
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,774
My ideas.
I'm running the show.

1233
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,681
I'm the quarterback,
and I'm not going to settle

1234
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,687
for no one, Mom.

1235
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:12,183
♪ I feel a sudden urge to sing

1236
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,024

Hi. Good to see you.
This is Irving.

1238
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,423
Dolly, Dolly.
Hi. How are you?

1239
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:21,298
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is Rosalyn. Carmine.

1240
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,961
The man's here.

1241
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,471
Carmie's here.

1242
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,972
The man's here.

1243
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:28,134
You must be so proud.

1244
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:29,540
Rocco, how are you?

1245
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:32,539
Rocco, the...
You know, like we do

1246
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,307
with the chicken,
very thin, right?

1247
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,712
Thin. Very thin.
Absolutely.

1248
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,218
Really thin,
look, the way he does this...

1249
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,276
- Does this chicken with the red sauce, right?
- Beautiful.

1250
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,377
With the red sauce,
the lemon?

1251
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:41,545
Oh, my God, the garlic.

1252
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,455
The garlic is amazing. It's so good.
It's so good.

1253
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,458
Here it is, right here.
Here it is. This is it.

1254
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,153
This. This right here,
this right here! Look at this!

1255
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,924
Oh, my God!
You're going to love it!

1256
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,829
You see it?
This is so good' so good.

1257
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,798
It's the piccata
of the gods.

1258
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,631
So
what's this, Rocco'?

1259
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,069
Carmie,
this is a nice digestive.

1260
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,401
Salute.

1261
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,736
Thank you, Rocco.
Thank you, Rocco.

1262
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,741
Salute. You're welcome.

1263
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,674
I believe that you
should treat people

1264
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,111
the way that you
want to be treated.

1265
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,911
Right? Didn't Jesus
say that or something?

1266
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,644
He may have.
I think also,

1267
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,119
always take
a favor over money.

1268
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,088
I think Jesus
said that as well.

1269
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,647
I don't know if he
said the second one,

1270
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,021
but he might have
said the first one.

1271
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:21,255
I chipped that moving furniture.
It's my new obsession.

1272
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,630
Moving, redecorating, it makes
me feel better, like exercise.

1273
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:29,000
But there's this topcoat that you
can only get from Switzerland.

1274
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,332
And I don't know
what I'm going to do

1275
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,168
because I'm running out of it,
but I love the smell of it.

1276
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,764
I can get it for you. Irv and
I can't get enough of it.

1277
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,468
I can get it for you. Of course.
That would be amazing.

1278
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,443
There's something,
the topcoat...

1279
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,812
It's, like, perfumey, but
there's also something rotten.

1280
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:43,351
And I know that sounds crazy,
but I can't get enough of it.

1281
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,817
Smell it. It's true.
Yeah.

1282
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,616
Dolly, historically,
 Oh, my God.

1283
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,189
The best perfumes in the world...
It's disgusting.

1284
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:49,689
...they're all laced with
something nasty and foul.

1285
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,691
It's true. Stop. Stop.
It is true. It is true.

1286
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,022
It feels true.
It feels true.

1287
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,459
Irving loves them.
Oh, my God.

1288
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,020
He can't get
enough of that smell.

1289
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,030
Can't get enough.

1290
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,327
Can't get enough. I can't get enough.
Carmine.

1291
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,527
Carmine, smell her nails.

1292
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:02,126
Sweet and sour.
Smell her nails.

1293
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,671
Rotten and delicious.
What am I smelling?

1294
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,206
It smells like flowers.
Am I right?

1295
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,831
Flowers, but with garbage.

1296
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,205
And, like... Yeah.

1297
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,504
Or like sour flowers.

1298
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,838
You know what that is for me?
It's coriander for me.

1299
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,576
But Irv loves it.
He can't get enough.

1300
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,241
- That's what hooks you.
- Mmm.

1301
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,910
He always comes back for it.
Yeah.

1302
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,544
I can't stop.

1303
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:21,881
I'm
having a good time.

1304
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:24,186
Oh, you two
are just so nice.

1305
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,386
Hey' listen...

1306
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,052
Yes?
He's going to...

1307
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,096
He's going to say,
"We have to talk business."

1308
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:30,392
In five.

1309
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:31,727
Four
Four

1310
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,859
- Three. Two. One.
- Three. Two. One.

1311
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:36,871
Thank you. Dolly, can me and the
man talk about business here?

1312
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,771
She's all right.
She's all right.

1313
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,610
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't do that!

1314
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,842
It makes me look
more drunk than lam.

1315
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,076
No, it's okay.

1316
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,208
I got you. Okay.

1317
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:52,253
I don't think
that's possible.

1318
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:55,289
I'm not this drunk. No, it was
just because I was laughing.

1319
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:57,416
Irving, please don't make me go.
Oh, she's fine. She's fine.

1320
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,084
She's fine. All right. I was
just starting to have fun.

1321
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,025
I was just starting to have fun.
Let's take her to the car.

1322
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,594
Didn't your fiancée
want to come out tonight?

1323
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,769
Yeah. No...

1324
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,430
I don't... Yeah, no.

1325
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,405
No, I don't know.

1326
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,777
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
we don't have to talk about it.

1327
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,608
I was just teasing you. I'm...
It's all right.

1328
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,376
It's all right.

1329
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,418
Do you ever think, like,
how did I end up here?

1330
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,384
Like, how did my life become this?
Do you ever think that?

1331
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,384
And you wonder, like...

1332
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,984
Am I ever gonna get
out to a better place,

1333
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,391
or is this it'?

1334
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,496
You feel like that?

1335
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,396
Yeah.

1336
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,435
Yeah, I do.

1337
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,569
I definitely know that.

1338
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,399
I'm sorry,
we don't have to go dancing.

1339
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,136
We can go have coffee or talk
or something, just...

1340
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,505
No, no, no, no.

1341
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,409
No. No, I need this.

1342
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,843
Please, I need to
go dancing with you.

1343
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,076

That's black, isn't it?

1424
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,207
I don't know.

1425
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:24,843
I don't know, maybe it's
a dumb question, but...

1426
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,013
I'm just wondering.

1427
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,852
Why are you asking?

1428
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,222

1434
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,762

want him to see

1435
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:48,035
how good this is going to be
for the community,

1436
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,045
how ready we are
for this opportunity.

1437

far his dollar will go.

01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,441

What do you think? Yeah.

1439
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,540
Yeah.
Yeah, we can do that. Yeah.

1440
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,553

01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,713

1442
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,720

I got you a gift.

1446
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,421

Okay.

1447
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,467

1450
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,838
What is it'?

1451
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:26,470
It's a microwave.
It heats up everything.

1452
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,810
Pasta, lasagna,
meatballs, whatever.

1453
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,315
Really? It's science.
Yeah, that's how it

1454
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,511
heats up the food,
it's scientific.

1455
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,519
And you specifically

1456
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,521
bought this

1457
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,786
science oven for me?

1458
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,418
Yeah.

1460
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,937
Thank you. Thank you.

1461
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,172

1462
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:55,607

let's get it out of here.

1463
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,542
I need a jet at Teterboro.

1464
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:00,308
I need a jet at Teterboro for the sheik.
I told you that.

1465
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,781
You don't need a jet.

1466
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,681
You just let him
walk to the curb at JFK.

1467
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,013
That's not how it works.

1468
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,815
No, you got to
start from the feet up.

1469
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,617
That doesn't mean anything.
What does that mean?

1470
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,180
It means you got
to be committed.

1471
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,782
It means you got to be
committed to something

1472
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,986
in your life, for
Christ's sake, all right?

1473
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,120
I want a jet at Teterboro
for the sheik.

1474
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,892
It could be a small jet,
doesn't even have to take off.

1475
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,624
'Cause I know you're so
worried about how much money

1476
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,996
the Bureau's
gonna fucking spend.

1477
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,969
You take off and land
on the tarmac' okay?

1478
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,007
All right, I'll... You can
have a jet for an hour, but it

1479
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,835
takes off and lands at Teterboro.
I got the jet?

1480
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,570
You got the jet, yeah.
All right, thank you.

1481
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,213
All right, so tell me the rest
of the ice fishing story.

1482
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,384
Where was I?
Your father woke you up,

1483
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,146
it was a blizzard,
it was Lake Canoga.

1484
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,210
Come on, come on.

1485
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,184
Okay, well, my brother
and I were on the ice,

1486
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:46,159
and my father came out of the
house and I could see him coming.

1487
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,889
He was holding a lantern
and he was in the blizzard,

1488
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,759
and I knew
he was gonna be angry.

1489
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:51,696
So I went
to intercept my father,

1490
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:53,428
because I knew if he
saw what my brother

1491
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,002
was doing,
he was gonna kill him.

1492
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,004
Oh, so you tried to
protect your brother,

1493
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,403
but you couldn't,
and that's why you feel bad,

1494
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,769
because you're
trying to protect me

1495
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,206
and you're worried about me. Is
that what the story's about?

1496
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,333
It's about protection. No,
it's not about protection.

1497
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,606
It's not?
No.

1498
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,612
All right, fine.

1499
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:11,080
"Don't put metal in that
science oven, Rosalyn.

1500
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,245
"Don't put metal
in the science...“

1501
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,749
He always treats me
like a fucking child.

1502
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,189
I'll do whatever I want.

1503
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,127
Oh!

1504
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,423
Another fire!
No, Danny, not that one!

1505
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:26,967
That one's empty.
We got to use the big one.

1506
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,195
I told you not to put metal
in the science oven.

1507
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,431
What'd you do that for?

1508
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,698
Don't make such a big deal.

1509
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,762
We'll just get another one.

1510
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,102
I don't want another one.

1511
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:35,699
I want the one
that Carmine gave me.

1512
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,109
"Oh, Carmine. I want the
one that Carmine gave me.

1513
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:39,441
"Carmine, Carmine."

1514
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,776
Why don't you
just marry Carmine?

1515
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,076
Get a little gold microwave

1516
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,776
and put it on
a chain around your neck.

1517
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,284
You want to be
more like Carmine?

1518
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,979
Why don't you build
something, like he does?

1519
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,453
Instead of all
your empty deals

1520
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,115
that are just like
your fucking science oven.

1521
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:52,318
You know, I read that
it takes all of the nutrition

1522
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:53,621
out of our food.

1523
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,127
It's empty,
just like your deals.

1524
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,129
Empty, empty.
Listen to this bullshit.

1525
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,665
It's not bullshit.

1526
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:01,133
I read it
in an article. Look.

1527
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,729
By Paul Brodeur.

1528
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:05,501
Bring something into
this house that's gonna

1529
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,097
take all the nutrition
out of our food

1530
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,074
and then light
our house on fire?

1531
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,772
Thank God for me.

1532
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,264
All right,
you've got this.

1533
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,645
I don't think you should come
to Carmine's party tonight.

1534
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,052
You look beautiful,
by the way.

1535
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,822
Don't look at me.
All right?

1536
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:59,861
Don't look at my legs,
don't look at my hair,

1537
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,951
don't smell my hair,
don't ask me how I am,

1538
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,622
don't talk to me
outside of these roles,

1539
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,029
'cause we're done.
Where you going?

1540
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,032
Just stand still.
Get under the umbrella.

1541
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:11,003
Come on. lt's just, Carmine
wants Rosalyn to come.

1542
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,698
I don't care.

1543
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,036
You weren't listening. I
don't care if Rosalyn comes.

1544
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,372
Just do your job, okay?

1545
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:20,641
You're nothing to me
until you're everything.

1546
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:25,809
I'm not Rosalyn, I'm not
gonna put up with that shit.

1547
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,653
That's a fucking jet,
right?

1548
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,854
It's good.

1549
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:36,329
That's the kind of
moves you need to make.

1550
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,559
Paco Hernandez?
Hi. How's it going?

1551
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:40,225
Richie DiMaso.
Nice to meet you.

1552
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:41,529
Nice to meet
you in person.

1553
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:42,899
This is Irving Rosenfeld.

1554
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,233
Paco Hernandez.
Nice to meet you.

1555
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:48,172
Paco? He's...
He's not a real Arab.

1556
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,539
No, I'm Mexican,
from Tucson.

1557
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,842
Where's... Where's my guy? Where's Al?
Where's Al from Queens?

1558
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,347
Who'? My friend from Queens.
Where is he?

1559
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,576
What are you doing? I
got to hire an FBI guy.

1560
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,414
You speak any Arabic?
Yeah.

1561
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,577
That's it?
That's good.

1562
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:01,849
No, I have
a couple of phrases.

1563
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,285
From the feet up,
you motherfucker.

1564
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,790
What are you doing?
Come on.

1565
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:06,792
Act noble. That's
it, just, you know,

1566
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:08,419
like you can't barely
understand English,

1567
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:09,963
you can't speak it, you say
as little as possible,

1568
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,794
you follow my lead,
all right? All right?

1569
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:13,561
Okay. Who's running this'?
I thought you were running it.

1570
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,398
I am running this, but you
got to listen to him.

1571
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,630
He's the guy
with the vision.

1572
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,262
I got the vision?
Know what vision I had?

1573
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,637
You just kissing my girl, right outside.
That's what vision I had.

1574
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,107
I thought
you guys broke up.

1575
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,939
I'm giving you
a compliment.

1576
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,708
What's going on'?

1577
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,440
Don't worry about it, all right?
You got a knife.

1578
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,108
All right,
this is for the mayor.

1579
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,981
You got to present it
to the mayor.

1580
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,748
Just look at me,
all right?

1581
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,153
Look me in the eye.

1582
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,155
This means a lot
to you, right?

1583
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,623
That knife.
Oh.

1584
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,456
Play it. You present
it, all right'?

1585
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,461
Friendship for life,
all right?

1586
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:43,792
You got to feel it.
Sacred, can you do it?

1587
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:44,990
Right.
Sacred. Sacred.

1588
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:46,829
You got to sell it. You got to sell it.
Sell it.

1589
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:48,630
If you believe it's sacred,
it's sacred. Right.

1590
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,465
All right? Can you do it?
Listen to what he's saying.

1591
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,971
It's the details, that's what
makes this guy a genius.

1592
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,631
Again?
You compliment me again?

1593
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,801
What is this, rubbing salt
in the wound? What are you?

1594
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,900
I'm complimenting you.

1595
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,614
You got any
other questions?

1596
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:01,740
Yeah, I think the name

1597
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,147
of this operation
is offensive.

1598
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,241
What, Abscam.
Arab scam?

1599
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,480
It's racist.

1600
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:07,816
Are you fucking kidding?

1601
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,856
What do you care?
You're Mexican.

1602
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:26,968
Hello, Sheik.

1603
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,167
Hello,
Sheik, my friend.

1604
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,337
Welcome. On behalf of the
great state of New Jersey,

1605
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:33,937
I want to welcome
you to New Jersey.

1606
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,482
I know that was redundant.
I'm sorry.

1607
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:36,710
I'm just very nervous.

1608
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:40,112
Thank you, thank you.

1609
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:45,187
We have a great party planned
for you this evening.

1610
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,988
What are you talking
about, I can't go?

1611
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,961
I just did my hair
and makeup and everything.

1612
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,691
Sheiks are very particular.

1613
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:52,994
It's international cultural
protocol, you know.

1614
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:54,228
You don't know that?

1615
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,529
International protocol?

1616
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,298
Yep. What the fuck are
you talking about?

1617
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:58,866
Do not answer that.

1618
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,372
Do not answer that!
Hello?

1619
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:01,874
Robert Spencer for Irving.

1620
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,910
Robert Spencer? I don't
know a Robert Spencer.

1621
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,673
What do you want?
I'm a business associate...

1622
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:08,373
Who is that? Who is that? I
tell you, for God's sake,

1623
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:10,381
I told you not to call here, all right'?
What is that about?

1624
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,018
Two more federal agents tonight.
What?

1625
01:10:13,076 --> 01:10:15,056
No. No way.
Two feds.

1626
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,350
No.
I need them.

1627
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,021
Bodyguards for the sheik.

1628
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:20,322
No, no, no, that's too many
guys for me to control.

1629
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,760
No. No.
Irving, remember

1630
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,489
who's in charge here.

1631
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,533
Rosalyn,
get off the extension.

1632
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:26,931
I'm not on it.

1633
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:28,559
Look, don't call
here again, all right?

1634
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:30,535
Don't call at home.
All right. Good night.

1635
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:32,266
All right.

1636
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,604
If it's a business call,
don't interrupt, all right?

1637
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,200
Federal agents?

1638
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,713
No, it's bodyguards for the, uh,
visiting dignitaries' that's all.

1639
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,580
What is it, an IRS thing?
Like a tax investigation?

1640
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,050
Why do you got to say that?
I mean, that's why

1641
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:46,610
I can't invite you...
It's too complicated.

1642
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,519
Are you in trouble? Look,
stop being so nosy.

1643
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,852
Look at this shit.
Well, I'm only nosy

1644
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,084
'cause you never
tell me anything.

1645
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,420
Can we clean up
this fridge? I mean,

1646
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:53,585
what are you
causing trouble for

1647
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:54,855
all the time?

1648
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,123
Do not answer that!

1649
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:57,698
Hello?
Hello, it's Carmine.

1650
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,030
Oh, hi, Carmine. We were
just talking about you.

1651
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,932
Yeah, Irving's being
a mean, boring man,

1652
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,401
saying that he doesn't
want me to come tonight

1653
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,461
Tell him he's crazy.
Well, I agree.

1654
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,472
Tell him yourself. It wouldn't
be a party without you.

1655
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,600
Can you imagine?
'Cause you're coming!

1656
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:10,939
Yeah.
Tell him yourself.

1657
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,478
All right. Hey, Carmie.

1658
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,273
Irving, you're crazy.
Your wife is coming.

1659
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:16,645
You kidding me?
She's the life of the party.

1660
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,877
Everybody loves her.

1661
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,044
I'm the life of the party.

1662
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,611
You know what she's like.
She's unpredictable. She's just...

1663
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,156
Hey, don't talk
about me like that!

1664
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,748
What is Carmine saying? I
can't hear what he's saying.

1665
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:25,884
Let me listen.
Hey, look, Irving,

1666
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,052
it's very important
that she comes,

1667
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,254
you understand?
Carmine loves me.

1668
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,796
This is a really big, big
night for us, you understand?

1669
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:31,297
Come on,
you got to bring your wife.

1670
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,128
And Dolly's got something
special for her' right?

1671
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:35,099
Yeah, I do, I got your nail polish.
See? Listen, listen.

1672
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:37,104
Yeah, I got your nail
polish for you, sweetie!

1673
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,605
See?
Something special for you.

1674
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,334
What is it? What is it?

1675
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:43,501
Come on. Tell me.
What... What...

1676
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,510
What is it?
You got a girlfriend coming?

1677
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:46,807
Come on,
I thought we were friends.

1678
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:49,611
You're not gonna tell me you got a girlfriend?
This is ridiculous.

1679
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,310
What is it?
Nah, it's...

1680
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,318
Look, we handle this
like men, you understand?

1681
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,355
You're bringing your wife.
We're gonna have a good time.

1682
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,151
All right, we'll see you there.
It'll be fun.

1683
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,350
That's an order from the mayor.
Goodbye.

1684
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,088
All right, you happy?
Go get ready.

1685
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:05,664
Yes, I am happy.

1686
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,931
♪ When are you gonna
come down?

1687

Yes, but they're
businessmen, okay?

little time with them

that's such a good idea.

we talk to these guys.

1741
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:44,784
Confer? What is there to confer about?
I don't understand.

1742
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,451
They're casino guys.

1743
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:47,789
They're casino guys.
They're the businessmen.

1744
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,830
Yeah, we come
all this way. Irving,

1745
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,193
we came all this way,
we should be here.

1746
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,494
What's everybody scared of?
What's everybody scared of?

1747
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,000
You just
got to be delicate.

1748
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:57,162
Those are the guys that you
guys are all scared of?

1749
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,205
Those guys over there?
They don't scare me.

1750
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,501

Hi. Can I join you?

1753
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,945
Irv, that's
not the way to do this.

1754
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,650
It's not a good idea.

1755
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:19,949
I love this.

1756
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,361
Everybody over there's really scared
of you guys, do you know that?

1757
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:24,556
- No.
Mm-hmm.

1758
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,291
Kids, I want you to go up

1759
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,301
and get some soda
and pizza, please.

1760
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,359
It's a disaster.

1761
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:33,740
I think they got
this room all wrong.

1762
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,241
Yeah?
What would you do?

1763
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,204
I would do it in
all black and gold,

1764
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,373
and I would do this bar
like a big warm golden mirror.

1765
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,677
Sounds beautiful.

1766
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,547
Oh, thank you. But you
expect that from her

1767
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,551
because she's so beautiful.
Oh, God, stop.

1768
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:48,713
Gorgeous.
And I love her hair,

1769
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:49,983
so I know I'm gonna
love what you do.

1770
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,548
- Oh, my God. It's messy.
- How do you do?

1771
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:52,990
I'm sorry,
is she your wife?

1772
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,494
No, she's my wife.
She's my wife.

1773
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,563
Look at these fine gentlemen.
Hey, Carmine, there you are.

1774
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:57,722
How you doing?
How are you?

1775
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,924
You well'?
Good to see you.

1776
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,227
How you doing?
Hey, how are you?

1777
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,562
That's enough
of that right now.

1778
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,034
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1779
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:05,402
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, stop ii.

1780
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,906
Hey, oh, no, it's because
he's a party pooper.

1781
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:09,533
He's so boring.

1782
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,339
May I present

1783
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,903
Sheik Abdullah,
gentlemen,

1784
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:16,347
from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,
these are professionals,

1785
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,385
and they run the best casinos
in the United States.

1786
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:20,751
Mr. Sheik, as a sign
of our seriousness,

1787
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:23,346
Mr. Tellegio came from
Miami to meet you tonight.

1788
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,751
Mr. Tellegio?

1789
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,724
Why didn't you tell me
Mr. Tellegio was...

1790
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,023
He's in the back room.

1791
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,530
It's a sign
of disrespect

1792
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,429
to talk, uh, business
on the first meeting.

1793
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,057
That's not true.
It's disrespectful...

1794
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:35,864
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about

1795
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,904
He's got it all wrong. You want
to leave him back there in

1796
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,303
the back room waiting?
Come on, let's go, we got

1797
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,068
to go meet him. My
friend from New York

1798
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,733
doesn't know the customs...
Hey, no disrespect, pal.

1799
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,243
Hey, Irving,
I'm gonna be having fun.

1800
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,075
Maybe it'll be
contagious, huh?

1801
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,808
You and me,
we're gonna visit.

1802
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,439
She's a fun girl.

1803
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,279
I'm having fun.

1804
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:54,047
Can you believe
he talks to me that way'?

1805
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,296
Carmine.

1806
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,128
Victor Tellegio
was from <i>Miami.</i>

1807
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,635
He was Meyer Lansky's
right-hand man.

1808
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:13,502
With his prior reputation as
an enforcer from 20 years ago,

1809
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:16,668
he was known to never bury a
body, because he felt it sent

1810
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,575
a stronger message to
leave it in the street.

1811
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,272
He looked at me like...

1812
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:26,081
This is the guy
we now had to deal with.

1813
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,822
You sure you don't
want to go into the Ocean Bar?

1814
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:31,948
It's really,
it's beautiful in there.

1815
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:35,257
No, I don't have to go there. I like it here.
There's an exit.

1816
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,828
I'm like a ghost.

1817
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,090
Nobody knows I'm here.

1818
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:43,161
Look, tell him I speak
for our friends in Florida.

1819
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:46,001
We're very excited.
It's been our lifelong dream

1820
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,336
to build casino resorts
on the East Coast.

1821
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,871
You told him that?

1822
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:55,514
They didn't want
the Jews to make money.

1823
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,015
They didn't want the
Italians to make money.

1824
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,177
They definitely don't want
the blacks to make money.

1825
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:02,518
After the oil embargo,
gasoline crisis,

1826
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,852
the hijackings,
the Olympics'

1827
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:07,826
they don't want to
see Arabs make money,

1828
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,692
trust me, not on our soil.

1829
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:13,196
And, I don't know, you can
tell him this in your own way.

1830
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,360
I've been in the casino
business 40 years'

1831
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,563
it's scrutinized more carefully
than any other business.

1832
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,200
Carmine made
this legal, but

1833
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,573
we must be careful,
or they'll take it away.

1834
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,538
So, Mr. Tellegio, how do you
think we should approach this?

1835
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,810
What do you think?
What do you want to do?

1836
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,414
Well, if you want to get the
gaming license and keep it,

1837
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,986
we have to make our principal
investor here, the sheik,

1838
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,857
an American citizen.

1839
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,395
Well,
to expedite citizenship,

1840
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:54,872
that requires very
special treatment.

1841
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,103
Well, you would know the right
people to do that, Carmine.

1842
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,405
Carmie knows everybody.

1843
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,411
What are
we talking about?

1844
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,913
Uh, U.S. senators...

1845
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,881
Uh, U.S. congressmen
and senators.

1846
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,714
Wow!
That's fantastic.

1847
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,253
I say stay away from that.

1848
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:11,188
That's bad,
that's trouble.

1849
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,555
It's not good.

1850
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,422
Irving, please.
That's trouble.

1851
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,427
Who is this guy'?
Who are you? Huh?

1852
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,759
What are you, a farmer?

1853
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,356
This is, uh...
Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry.

1854
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,095
This is Irving.
Irving.

1855
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,431
This is Irving Rosenfeld.

1856
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:24,697
Irving, Irving.

1857
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,932
Yes. New York businessman.

1858
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:28,565
What's the matter, Irving?
What's the problem?

1859
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:30,110
Nothing.
No problem.

1860
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,440
Eh, you know, don't get
your balls in an uproar.

1861
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,411
Everything's fine,
everything's good.

1862
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,140
It's
all good, it's all good.

1863
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:37,717
It's all good.
I just hope

1864
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,383
the other part of
this is all good.

1865
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,945
And real.
Because we're real.

1866
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,455
You know that. Yes.
That's correct.

1867
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,719
You deal with us,
we're a real organization.

1868
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,955
We're dealing with you, we don't
know what we're dealing with.

1869
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,802
Where is he from'?

1870
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,339
Abu Dhabi.

1871
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:02,137
Oh, he's from the Emirates.
Yeah.

1872
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:04,970
Can I count on you?

1873
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:07,741
You gotta be honest about this.
Did you understand me?

1874
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,283
"Good" means good.

1875
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:11,784
No bullshit.

1876
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,417
Did you hear what I said?

1877
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,290
Do you want me to repeat it?

1878
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,660
What do you think now?

1879
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,200
Tell me.

1880
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:31,093
Tell me.

1881
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,177
Uh."

1882
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,311
I think...
I think, what is, uh...

1883
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,942
No, no,
let him speak for himself.

1884
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,713
Uh...

1885
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,285
It's okay.
He's a friend of mine.

1886
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,789
It's okay,
I know him, I know him.

1887
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:50,846
I know him,
he's a friend of mine.

1888
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,153
You guys are way too
serious for a party.

1889
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,717
Holy cow.
What are you drinking?

1890
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:55,852
Hey, Al, listen to me.
You got a drink?

1891
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,192
We're in a very serious meeting.
I apologize.

1892
01:20:58,287 --> 01:20:59,857
You got to come with me now.
You got a speech that...

1893
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,865
Everybody's waiting for you.
Al, I'll be right behind you.

1894
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,959
Okay, trust me. Right behind you, okay?
Come on.

1895
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,303
It'll be great
doing business with you.

1896
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,903
The investment is real.

1897
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:13,310
It was a pleasure to meet you.

1898
01:21:14,136 --> 01:21:18,050
What are the fucking odds of an
Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic?

1899
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,552
It turns out he's got casino
investments in the Mideast,

1900
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,213
and he spent two years learning
it Io keep the upper hand.

1901
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:24,814
Listen to me carefully.

1902
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,088
If you're real,
you put$10 million

1903
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:29,321
in the bank of our choice
in the next two weeks.

1904
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,693
Carmine,
listen to me carefully.

1905
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:31,823
If you're real,
you put$10 million

1906
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,696
in the bank of our choice
in the next two weeks

1907
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:35,997
or not only will
the sheik feel insulted,

1908
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,504
but our friends in Florida
will feel deeply disrespected.

1909
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,732
So will I.

1910
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:51,283
What a girl.

1911
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:52,784
Rosalyn, you need to
come with me, all right?

1912
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:53,876
Oh, I need
to come with you'?

1913
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,785
Yeah, you need to come with me,
this needs to stop, all right?

1914
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:58,188
Oh, you think I should come with you?
Why don't you go...

1915
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,249
Get your fucking hands off
me, you fucking whore.

1916
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:01,419
You're a whore.

1917
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:02,552
Oh, okay.
That's really nice.

1918
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,689
We're not gonna do this in the
Ocean Room tonight, please.

1919
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,232
This is my husband's whore!

1920
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,767
You know, you stay
here right now, darling.

1921
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,529
Please, please, please. You
stay over here with me.

1922
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,366
Everybody just calm down.
I don't know what's going on.

1923
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:12,462
You all right?

1924
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:13,733
Take it easy, okay?

1925
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:15,104
All right.
These things happen.

1926
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:17,268
Whatever's meant
to be is meant to be.

1927
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:18,970
All right?
I always say that.

1928
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,137
You say that?
Yeah.

1929
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:21,475
See, kindred spirits.

1930
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,983
Whatever's meant
to be will be.

1931
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,557
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1932
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,000
What do I think I'm doing? Yeah.

1933
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,125
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1934
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:44,636
You're gonna come
in here and judge me

1935
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,000
for flirting with someone
after you've been fucking

1936
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,971
my husband for how many years?
I'm not fucking judging you.

1937
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,633
You don't have any fucking
clue what's going on!

1938
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,301
I got a ring
on my finger.

1939
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,243
We have a child together.

1940
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:54,812
He doesn't love you,
Rosalyn.

1941
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,975
He loves me, and you know it,
and I know it, and he knows it.

1942
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:01,111
And it might be done now, but it
was beautiful and it was real.

1943
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:02,621
Stop it.
And we loved each other.

1944
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:04,021
Shut up.
You scare him,

1945
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:07,093
and you manipulate him,
and you use your son.

1946
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:12,630
Well, he must like it on some level.
He must want it,

1947
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:14,099
because he keeps
coming back for it.

1948
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,659
It's like that perfume that you
love that you can't stop smelling

1949
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:18,931
even when there's
something sour in it.

1950
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,598
You can't get enough of it.

1951
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:24,109
But guess what?
He's never gonna leave me.

1952
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:26,638
He's always
going to want me,

1953
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:29,205
and I will make
you so sorry, Edith.

1954
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:32,308
I will make you so sorry for
what you've done to my family.

1955
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,012
Mark my words.

1956
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,679
That is fucked-up.

1957
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:37,723
I would never say anything
that fucked-up to anybody,

1958
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:39,121
but you do because
you're gross inside.

1959
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:40,285
You're so fucked-up
and gross.

1960
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,350
Oh, I'm gross inside?
Yeah.

1961
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,622
Maybe you're gross inside.

1962
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,459
What, robbing people and
all that shit that you do.

1963
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,194
Maybe we're both gross inside.
That's what Irving loves about us.

1964
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:48,700
At least he's consistent.

1965
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:52,328
You know, sometimes in life,
all you have are fucked-up'

1966
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,805
poisonous choices.

1967
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,578

They say there's

1988
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:56,785
You got to be kidding me.

01:25:57,419 --> 01:25:59,365
Don't they know who
built this country?

upon in the state of New Jersey

No!

1993
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,380
Please, raise a glass with me

1994
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,446

1995
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:25,655
From me and my family,

1996
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:27,284
we thank you

1997
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:31,559
<i>for at! the hard work that you've
given us in the community.</i>

1998
01:26:32,454 --> 01:26:34,957
Look what you've done.
This is beautiful.

1999
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:37,199
Thank you.

2000
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,485
Edith!

2001
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:08,561
Use your phone?

2002
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:16,498
Last night was insane.
I got it all figured out.

2003
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:22,640
Stoddard Thorsen.

2004
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:26,235
Listen, I need the Sherman Suite
at the Plaza Hotel, okay?

2005
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,110
That's a whole
floor of the hotel.

2006
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:31,413
No, no, no, no, I need the whole floor.
I need it for my operation.

2007
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,787
Stop calling it your operation, Richard.
It's not your operation,

2008
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:37,289
and I'm not giving you a whole
floor of the Plaza Hotel.

2009
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,652
I have members of Congress that
are gonna come in right now

2010
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:42,160
and try to give the sheik
citizenship, all right?

2011
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,593
They're taking bribes.

2012
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,598
That's happening right now. That's
what's happening right now.

2013
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:49,264
Bribing members of Congress? Are
you out of your fucking mind?

2014
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,962
Stoddard, Stoddard,
no, shut up!

2015
01:28:51,026 --> 01:28:53,097
Listen, do you know
who Victor Tellegio is?

2016
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:57,166
Victor Tellegio. Works for Meyer Lansky.
You know who that is?

2017
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:58,300
I know who Victor...

2018
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,039
Resorts International,
all right?

2019
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:02,706
He wants $10 million. I have
two weeks, I have two...

2020
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,683
Listen to me, just listen to me.
Listen to me!

2021
01:29:05,774 --> 01:29:07,549
You're not
listening to me!

2022
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:08,982
I have two weeks!

2023
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,018
I have two weeks to
put this thing together.

2024
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:14,184
And I need you to get me the
Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel!

2025
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:15,283
Lower your voice.

2026
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,624
And you're gonna
fucking do it!

2027
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:17,823
You don't get to
say what happens

2028
01:29:17,886 --> 01:29:19,388
and you don't
get to yell at me.

2029
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,994
Calm me down, baby.

2030
01:29:24,059 --> 01:29:25,504
Calm me down.

2031
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:29,004
You've got to calm me down.

2032
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:31,340
You got to calm
me down, baby.

2033
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,735
You got to calm me down.

2034
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:37,376
You got to calm
me down, baby.

2035
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:38,883
Let's do it,
let's do this right now.

2036
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:40,248
No, no, no.
Let's do it.

2037
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,310
We're not gonna do it unless...
No, I want to do it right now.

2038
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,412
I want to do
this right now.

2039
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:44,922
I want you so bad. Look at your skin.
No, no, no.

2040
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:46,424
Oh, my God, your fucking
skin is glowing.

2041
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:48,323
No, no, no. Baby, your
fucking skin is glowing.

2042
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,090
We're not gonna go all the
way until we do it for real.

2043
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,526
I want to do it now.
Remember, we agreed on that

2044
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,065
That's what we agreed
on, all right?

2045
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:54,895
So we're not gonna
do that, all right?

2046
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:56,765
All right?
Where are you?

2047
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:57,996
I'm here. You're
acting all scary.

2048
01:29:58,093 --> 01:30:00,232
Honey, I'm here, okay? Yeah.
Okay, are you here with me?

2049
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:01,830
I love you.

2050
01:30:03,665 --> 01:30:04,871
It is real now.

2051
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:06,378
I just...
I just said it.

2052
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:08,776
So now's the time.

2053
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,042
Look at me,
look at me.

2054
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:13,882
I love you.

2055
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,016
I just said that.

2056
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,953
I'm in love with you.

2057
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:37,900
Do you want the truth?
You want real? Yeah.

2058
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:39,775
You want real, okay.

2059
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:41,575
I'm ready for real.

2060
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:45,311
This is real.
Do you hear my voice, huh?

2061
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,443
This is real.

2062
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:50,049
This is real,
what you hear is real.

2063
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:51,413
This is real.

2064
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:52,787
What?

2065
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,618
This is me.
What do you mean?

2066
01:30:56,718 --> 01:30:57,822
What, are you
doing an accent?

2067
01:30:57,919 --> 01:30:58,954
The American accent?

2068
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:00,226
No, there is no English.

2069
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,427
There's only American,
there is no English.

2070
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,292
I'm not...

2071
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:05,894
What are you
talking about?

2072
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:07,803
Stop it. You're Edith,
you're Edith Greensly. No.

2073
01:31:07,896 --> 01:31:09,432
Not royal, but you're British.
I checked your records.

2074
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:12,307
No, I falsified
my records back to birth.

2075
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,073
I falsified them.
I...

2076
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:20,519
My name is Sydney Presser, and I'm
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

2077
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:24,083
I'm not Edith Greensly.
There is no Edith Greensly.

2078
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:37,431
You're freaking me out.

2079
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,637
No, you said
in the stall

2080
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:50,677
that we were
gonna be real

2081
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:52,979
and that we weren't
gonna fake it.

2082
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:54,850
I'm being real now.

2083
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:57,981
This is who I am. I'm
Sydney Prosser, okay?

2084
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:00,184
So...

2085
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:04,195
Why did you do an English
accent after that?

2086
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,622
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you in the stall.

2087
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,632
I created Edith because I
needed her to survive, okay?

2088
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,069
But I'm done
with that now.

2089
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,231
I'm so fucking done with it.

2090
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:16,701
All right, like, you do what
you need to survive, right?

2091
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:18,243
You, like...

2092
01:32:19,234 --> 01:32:21,578
You, um, you know,
you live with your mom.

2093
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:24,206
You have a fiancée you don't
even acknowledge, right'?

2094
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,012
That's what you do,
and you curl your hair

2095
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,714
in little fucking curlers,
which is...

2096
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:31,154
No, it's okay. You look
good with it, but...

2097
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,850
You know,
you have straight hair.

2098
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:34,086
So that's what
you do to survive.

2099
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:35,320
You do all sorts
of things, you know?

2100
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,657
We all do.

2101
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,759
Please don't talk
about that.

2102
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:43,762
I'm confused.
I'm confused.

2103
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:45,360
I'm fucking confused,
too, all right?

2104
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:48,567
I think we should fuck,
and then we'll feel it,

2105
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:51,738
and then we won't
be confused anymore.

2106
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:56,414
No, I want to talk.
I don't want to fuck, okay?

2107
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:58,575
No. No. I think that
will be better.

2108
01:32:58,673 --> 01:32:59,777
No. Let's just see how we feel.

2109
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,047
No, I'm not fucking you!
I'm not fucking fucking you!

2110
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,183
Oh, shit.

2111
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,962
Oh, my God.

2112
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,600
Can you please
step away from Edith'?

2113
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:19,069
What the... Please, I'm
asking you nicely.

2114
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:20,435
Please step away
from Edith right now.

2115
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:22,530
Come on, step away
from her. Please.

2116
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:24,541
You mean Sydney?

2117
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,971
I told him. I'm sorry.

2118
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,649
I just don't give
a fuck anymore.

2119
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,811
I don't give a fuck,
I don't fucking care.

2120
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:36,047
I don't fucking...

2121
01:33:37,412 --> 01:33:39,619
Irving has a gun, huh?

2122
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:42,092
What Richie's got us
into is worse than jail.

2123
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:44,894
I told you last night,

2124
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,330
don't sit down
with those goons.

2125
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:47,957
And what'?
Now what, huh?

2126
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:51,094
No one's getting $10 million
for Tellegio. It's over.

2127
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:52,263
I don't think so.

2128
01:33:52,594 --> 01:33:54,505
What?
What do you mean?

2129
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,474
Because when Tellegio
finds out what happened,

2130
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:00,671
you think he's
gonna go after me?

2131
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:02,270
Someone from the Bureau?

2132
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,073
Or he's gonna go
after a politician'?

2133
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:07,145
He's gonna kill you.

2134
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:11,416
And he's gonna
go after your son

2135
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:14,952
and Sydney.

2136
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,501
Stoddard Thorsen.

2137
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:26,765
You got to get me the Sherman Suite.
The whole ﬂoor.

2138
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,775
That's a no.
I said no, wacko. Jesus.

2139
01:34:30,532 --> 01:34:34,173
Then you're gonna tell me the point
of that fucking fishing story.

2140
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:35,680
Not the way
you're behaving.

2141
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,545
What's the matter with you?
Where are you right now?

2142
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:39,209
I... Why does that
make a difference?

2143
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:41,287
Just tell me where
the fuck you are.

2144
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,117
The field office
on 61st Street.

2145
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:46,523
I'm coming to 61st
Street right now.

2146
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:47,615
You're gonna do what?

2147
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:49,787
To beat your ass.

2148
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,125
You're gonna what?

2149
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:00,663
You were right.

2150
01:35:01,963 --> 01:35:03,840
Should've gone away.

2151
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,671
I should've
gone away with you.

2152
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:09,840
We were supposed to do it from the
feet up, like you always said.

2153
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:11,178
That's how we were
meant to do it,

2154
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:12,843
only you didn't
do it like that.

2155
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:14,352
You didn't do it like that.

2156
01:35:14,409 --> 01:35:16,218
You played it safe,
so there was always a danger

2157
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:18,723
you were gonna end up with
Rosalyn in the dead space,

2158
01:35:18,813 --> 01:35:20,554
floating on
some dead spaceship

2159
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:22,719
with the furnitures
and the curtains.

2160
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,729
And I was your lifeline out,
and you were mine,

2161
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,697
and that was okay,
you know?

2162
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:32,095
I wish I could
get you back.

2163
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:36,600
Yeah.

2164
01:35:44,005 --> 01:35:47,077
You know I can't
do it without you.

2165
01:35:47,175 --> 01:35:48,518
You know that.

2166
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,122
Come on.

2167
01:35:54,282 --> 01:35:57,422
Me, you and Danny,
like we said.

2168
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:58,861
Like I said.

2169
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,196
You never said that.
I said that.

2170
01:36:04,392 --> 01:36:07,635
We got to get over
on all these guys.

2171
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:09,970
That's what we need to be
thinking about right now.

2172
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:14,613
Fuck, shit,
that's, uh...

2173
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,647
That's big.

2174
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:19,480
That's fucking crazy.

2175
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:28,656
Whatever it is,

2176
01:36:31,486 --> 01:36:33,659
it's got to be the best
we've ever done.

2177
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:40,266
Okay?

2178
01:36:46,067 --> 01:36:49,310
"Agent DiMaso called me
late on the night of the 21st.

2179
01:36:49,404 --> 01:36:51,680
"I believe that
he was intoxicated.

2180
01:36:51,773 --> 01:36:55,482
"He threatened me. I told
him this was inappropriate.

2181
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:58,921
"Procedures exist for purposes
that we must respect.

2182
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:03,456
"This is the third such call
I received from Agent DiMaso.

2183
01:37:03,518 --> 01:37:07,091
"He called me again on the
night of the 5th at 2:00 a.m.,

2184
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:08,998
"and he threatened
to kill me.

2185
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,469
"Subsequently, he
demanded that I allow him

2186
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:14,837
"to use the Sherman
Suite of the Plaza Hotel

2187
01:37:14,929 --> 01:37:19,036
"for purposes of bribing
members of Congress."

2188
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:20,840
I...

2189
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:22,972
I am so sorry.

2190
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:26,346
I'm not finished.
There's a lot more.

2191
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:31,989
I have nothing but the utmost
respect for you as my mentor and...

2192
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,548
It's okay, it's okay.

2193
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:35,355
As my mentor and as...

2194
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,520
What are you doing?

2195
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:37,857
I just want
to talk from my heart.

2196
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:40,296
I don't want to put it on record or anything.
I want to get vulnerable.

2197
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:41,629
Can I finish <i>my...</i>

2198
01:37:43,558 --> 01:37:45,037
Can I finish my statement?
Of course, of course.

2199
01:37:45,126 --> 01:37:46,332
That's why we're here.

2200
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:48,703
I respect you.

2201
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:51,538
I think you do other
things besides respect me.

2202
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:53,205
Hello.
Hey, hey, hey, hey-

2203
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:54,473
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

2204
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:55,809
What are you doing?

2205
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,211
It's just hard for me to control my passion.
I'm a very passionate person.

2206
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,880
We're from New York.
You understand this.

2207
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,980
He goes ice fishing
in the Midwest.

2208
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,349
That was told
to you in confidence.

2209
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:11,220
He's an ice fishing guy.
Look at him.

2210
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,264
What are you doing?

2211
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:16,392
It's not you, that's not
you with the gun. Stop it.

2212
01:38:16,524 --> 01:38:18,435
No, it's me, it's me.

2213
01:38:18,526 --> 01:38:20,528
Don't do something you don't
know anything about, all right?

2214
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,072
Wait, wait, put that... I'll
show you who gets shot.

2215
01:38:22,163 --> 01:38:23,369
Do not load that gun!

2216
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:24,739
You drop that gun!

2217
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:26,175
I'm not even
gonna hit you.

2218
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,009
Don't! Don't!
Watch this, fucko.

2219
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:34,785
So...

2220
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:37,114
You want to use
the Sherman Suite?

2221
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:39,054
The entire floor?
Yes.

2222
01:38:39,614 --> 01:38:41,594
Oh, God.
Of the Plaza Hotel.

2223
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:43,184
What happened to the Mafia?
I thought you...

2224
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:44,423
Yes, no, no, no, this is
where they intersect.

2225
01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:45,793
This is where
the two things intersect

2226
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:48,527
The two worlds, the
politicians and the Mafia.

2227
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:51,229
Victor Tellegio's people, who
run Resorts International...

2228
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,272
Wait a minute. Victor
Tellegio showed his face?

2229
01:38:53,361 --> 01:38:55,307
Yeah, I sat with
Victor Tellegio.

2230
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,531
I hung out with him.

2231
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:57,940
Yeah, we can get him,

2232
01:38:58,032 --> 01:38:59,306
we can get his
whole organization,

2233
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,938
as well as getting
any number of congressmen.

2234
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:04,414
I mean, that's just...

2235
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:06,042
That's just peeling the
first layer of the onion.

2236
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:07,745
Wow.

2237
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,312
How you gonna do that?

2238
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:12,957
We would get $10 million, that we...
$10 million?

2239
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:14,321
And that's how we just let
them know we're for real.

2240
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:15,450
$10 million?

2241
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:16,824
All right, so what does he
say he's gonna do for us?

2242
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:18,625
How are we trapping him?
They're gonna promise

2243
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,257
to build casinos, handle the
skims, do the licensing...

2244
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,963
And you have what? You have
him on tape saying this?

2245
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,902
You have that, right?
No.

2246
01:39:27,662 --> 01:39:30,973
I want you to find a safer way to
get Victor Tellegio on a wire.

2247
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,669
No $10 million.
That's crazy.

2248
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:34,678
Thank you.
Right?

2249
01:39:34,769 --> 01:39:37,147
Even to entrap Tellegio,
it's crazy.

2250
01:39:37,238 --> 01:39:40,481
But you can have
the Sherman Suite.

2251
01:39:40,575 --> 01:39:42,350
No, no.
Stoddard, please.

2252
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:44,821
To go and get me some congressmen.
Oh, my God.

2253
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:48,155
Go get some congressmen
taking bribes.

2254
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:50,786
I want to pinch us some
congressmen, okay?

2255
01:39:50,852 --> 01:39:52,490
You come back to me,
I'm proud of you.

2256
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:54,327
Thank you.

2257
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:56,165
And Stoddard.

2258
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:58,593
Good luck keeping
your job, by the way,

2259
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:01,037
and staying out of jail, and
not being killed by the Mob,

2260
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:03,267
but otherwise,
you're doing a great job.

2261
01:40:05,266 --> 01:40:06,210
What's the end of
the ice fishing story?

2262
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,870
I'm not telling you the end
of the ice fishing story!

2263
01:40:07,969 --> 01:40:09,107
I'm gonna call
your fucking brother

2264
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,615
and find out the end.
My brother's dead!

2265
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:11,843
That's how it ends!

2266
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,282
He fell through
the fucking ice!

2267
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,879
Not, that's not... He died a
different way, many years later.

2268
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:25,491
Listen, I know
it's awkward, and, uh,

2269
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,496
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, all right?

2270
01:40:28,823 --> 01:40:31,531
But I think we can stick together
and, uh, still fulfill our goal.

2271
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:32,730
I mean,
we got the Sherman Suite.

2272
01:40:32,827 --> 01:40:33,897
Yeah, you got
the whole floor?

2273
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:35,497
Got the whole floor, yeah.
Whole floor?

2274
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:36,564
That's good.

2275
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:38,041
Yeah, you okay?

2276
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:39,736
Yeah. You'?

2277
01:40:39,834 --> 01:40:42,212
Yeah, you know, it's all right.
Just got hit a little bit.

2278
01:40:42,303 --> 01:40:44,214
My eye is a little blurry.

2279
01:40:44,305 --> 01:40:46,182
I got drops
at the pharmacy.

2280
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,844
Uh, you okay'?
Yeah, I'm good.

2281
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:49,147
Listen, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

2282
01:40:49,477 --> 01:40:50,820
I'm sorry.

2283
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:53,018
I'm sorry, Irv.

2284
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:58,361
You can put a camera here.

2285
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:01,025
Right in here, maybe,
and we get it all on film.

2286
01:41:01,489 --> 01:41:02,729
You like it?
We do.

2287
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:03,858
You know what,
give me those flowers.

2288
01:41:03,925 --> 01:41:05,927
If we put the flower vase
here, put a camera in there,

2289
01:41:06,027 --> 01:41:07,563
and then we can get
a clear shot of the couch

2290
01:41:07,662 --> 01:41:08,834
where we can put
the congressmen.

2291
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:10,068
That's right.
That's the idea.

2292
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:12,735
And Carmine will go
to jail after he delivers us

2293
01:41:12,867 --> 01:41:14,278
congressmen soon-to-be felons.

2294
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:16,008
We really need the help.
Please sit down.

2295
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,072
on the phone.

2296
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:21,016
I got to take this, you guys.
Everyone out, please.

2297
01:41:21,342 --> 01:41:23,117
This is sad,
it's just sad.

2298
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,621
Darling, please,
I got to take this.

2299
01:41:24,712 --> 01:41:26,749
Okay, sorry, everyone out.
Go out.

2300
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:29,123
Congressman, how you doing?
It's Carmine.

2301
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,286
Everybody out, please.

2302
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:31,954
Tell me you're gonna
be in Trenton this week.

2303
01:41:32,053 --> 01:41:33,726
We have an amazing
investment opportunity

2304
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:35,028
I'd like 10 discuss with you.

2305
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:37,593
I'm Federal Agent
Richard DiMaso.

2306
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:40,229
I placed $75, 000
into this briefcase

2307
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:42,570
for Representative John O'Connell
of the Ninth District.

2308
01:41:42,863 --> 01:41:45,605
Representative O'Connell was
contacted by Carmine Polito

2309
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,579
to ask if he could obtain rapid
citizenship through an act of Congress

2310
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:50,646
for one Sheik Abdul/ah,
investor.

2311
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:52,546
How you doing? Robert Spencer.
Nice to meet you.

2312
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:54,318
I'm excited to be here.

2313
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:57,218
Oh, John, please,
this brings the state back.

2314
01:41:57,545 --> 01:41:58,956
How long we known
each other?

2315
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:00,286
You know what this
is gonna do for us?

2316
01:42:00,381 --> 01:42:02,292
This is huge for the
state of New Jersey.

2317
01:42:02,383 --> 01:42:03,885
Stabilizes our economy.

2318
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,055
Hotels, restaurants.

2319
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,826
Carmine sees it.
It's waiting to happen.

2320
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:08,400
This fucking thing
is waiting to happen.

2321
01:42:08,556 --> 01:42:10,126
But the goddamn bankers,

2322
01:42:10,224 --> 01:42:11,635
they're keeping their
money on the sidelines.

2323
01:42:11,726 --> 01:42:12,727
How we supposed to
get anything clone?

2324
01:42:12,927 --> 01:42:15,498
Bankers only put
money in the game

2325
01:42:15,596 --> 01:42:18,076
when they can
reap insane profit.

2326
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:20,072
The only problem
is this, uh...

2327
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,841
This citizenship situation.

2328
01:42:21,936 --> 01:42:23,916
I mean, we got to expedite
as soon as possible.

2329
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:32,253
Well, I'll tell you,
you came to the right place.

2330
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:33,348
Yeah?
You know? Yeah.

2331
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:34,949
- We can make it happen.
- Oh, hey.

2332
01:42:35,016 --> 01:42:36,791
This is going to happen.

2333
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:38,262
You understand,
this is real.

2334
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:41,323
On my family, on my kids,
on my life, on my work.

2335
01:42:41,422 --> 01:42:43,163
I know that, Carmine.
You're a good man.

2336
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:44,861
I'm Federal Agent
Richard DiMaso.

2337
01:42:44,959 --> 01:42:46,996
I placed $75, 000
in this briefcase

2338
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:49,506
for one Representative Gerald
Sanders of the Third District.

2339
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,170
I don't want to do
anything illegal.

2340
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:52,266
Please, Gerry, use it

2341
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,313
as a campaign donation,
whatever you want to do.

2342
01:42:54,435 --> 01:42:56,312
All right. Thank you.
It means a lot.

2343
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:58,816
I'm placing $60, 000
into this briefcase

2344
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:01,149
for one Congressman Eric Keshoygan
of the Fourth District.

2345
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:03,313
I'm gonna do what
I can to help, Carmine.

2346
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:05,015
$100, 000 into this briefcase

2347
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:08,685
for two-term
United States Senator

2348
01:43:08,783 --> 01:43:10,023
Horton Mitchell
of New Jersey.

2349
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:11,391
Atlantic City.
That's right.

2350
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:13,055
All the way
down the shore.

2351
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:15,527
A mecca by the sea.

2352
01:43:15,623 --> 01:43:18,365
Carmine, you're beloved
by your people.

2353
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:22,236
Your constituency is not even a constituency.
It's your family.

2354
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:23,967
That's what you
represent, family.

2355
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:26,173
The one small thing
you do for this man

2356
01:43:26,233 --> 01:43:28,713
is a huge thing we do for
the people of New Jersey.

2357
01:43:28,803 --> 01:43:29,873
This is what
we can leave...

2358
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:31,972
Hey, Irving,
what are you doing?

2359
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,411
Where you going?

2360
01:43:33,808 --> 01:43:36,982
Just got to go see a man about a dog.
 I'm sorry.

2361
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:40,856
I've been a senator
a very long time. 16 years.

2362
01:43:40,915 --> 01:43:42,258
Trust me, this is probably

2363
01:43:42,349 --> 01:43:43,919
the biggest opportunity
that we could have here.

2364
01:43:44,018 --> 01:43:47,864
I will do whatever! can
in the United States Senate.

2365
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,501
I appreciate this.
On my family,

2366
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:53,164
on my kids, this needs to happen.
It's got to happen.

2367
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:55,439
You have my word.

2368
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:11,082
I want to save us, I want to
save us, I want to save Carmine.

2369
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:12,851
It's killing me,
it's fucking killing me.

2370
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:15,689
You know the only way to help Carmine
is through the Tellegio thing.

2371
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,785
Yes.

2372
01:44:16,884 --> 01:44:18,864
It's dangerous, it's dangerous.
We got to get in there,

2373
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:20,899
we got to get a wire in there,
we got to make him feel safe.

2374
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:23,763
There's only one thing that
could really fuck this up,

2375
01:44:23,858 --> 01:44:25,360
and that's your wife.

2376
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:27,536
Yeah.

2377
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:08,941
I don't like your husband.
You're no good together.

2378
01:45:09,003 --> 01:45:10,573
He doesn't appreciate you.

2379
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,449
I mean, it happens,
it happened to my marriage.

2380
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:15,180
That's why
I went to Miami.

2381
01:45:15,843 --> 01:45:17,447
Sometimes you just
got to be tough.

2382
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,424
You got to stand up and you
got to leave, you know?

2383
01:45:21,282 --> 01:45:24,320
Sometimes you got to let something
die to let something live.

2384
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,931
You're too beautiful
to be unhappy.

2385
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:29,759
I know.

2386
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:32,532
I mean, I don't want
to badmouth my husband,

2387
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:35,607
but just let me badmouth
my husband for a second.

2388
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:37,142
He just thinks that
he knows everything,

2389
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:39,337
and he's so full of shit.
He's such a liar.

2390
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:41,845
He thinks that I'm stupid,
but I'm not stupid.

2391
01:45:41,936 --> 01:45:43,779
I hear him on the phone,
arguing.

2392
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,840
He loves Carmine, but he
hates that other guy,

2393
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,942
that curly-headed
IRS guy or whatever,

2394
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:52,052
who's carting around my husband's
ex-lover, that redheaded whore.

2395
01:45:52,813 --> 01:45:53,848
IRS?

2396
01:45:53,948 --> 01:45:56,189
Anyway, you can see
that it drives him crazy.

2397
01:45:56,483 --> 01:45:59,487
When you said IRS, what IRS guy?
What are you talking about?

2398
01:45:59,553 --> 01:46:00,657
I hear them on the phone.

2399
01:46:01,155 --> 01:46:04,136
I think that he's got Irv in
some sort of bind or something,

2400
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:06,034
and he's making him
do all of this stuff.

2401
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:09,164
And so Irv and Carmine right
now are at the Plaza Hotel,

2402
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:12,575
like, throwing all of this money
away at, like, Congress or whatever.

2403
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:14,339
They're giving money
to Congress or something.

2404
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:17,314
I don't really know, but I
overheard it on the phone.

2405
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:21,348
Well,
I hate to do this to you.

2406
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:24,414
I got to go talk
to your husband.

2407
01:46:25,145 --> 01:46:26,647
My boss,
he's already angry.

2408
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:28,048
You stay here.

2409
01:46:28,148 --> 01:46:30,150
I'm gonna give you some
money for a taxi home.

2410
01:46:30,818 --> 01:46:33,560
Have some dessert, finish
the bottle of Prosecco.

2411
01:46:33,654 --> 01:46:34,758
I'm sorry.

2412
01:46:41,929 --> 01:46:43,772
You all right?

2413
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:45,400
I don't like change.

2414
01:46:49,603 --> 01:46:50,741
It's really hard for me.

2415
01:46:50,838 --> 01:46:51,908
Yeah.

2416
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:57,681
Sometimes I think that
I'll die before I change.

2417
01:46:58,946 --> 01:47:00,448
It's all right.

2418
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:06,389
It's gonna be okay.

2419
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:08,057
You got to come
with me to Miami.

2420
01:47:09,123 --> 01:47:11,694
Don't hurt him too bad.
He's still Danny's father.

but your father is
a sick son of a bitch.

2436
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:25,106
Daddy's a sick
son of a bitch?

2437
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:27,642
Don't repeat that.

2438
01:48:27,701 --> 01:48:28,771
But yes.

2439
01:48:37,544 --> 01:48:38,852
Rosalyn!

2440
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,887
Rosalyn!

2441
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:43,290
What? This is a dark moment
in our relationship.

2442
01:48:43,384 --> 01:48:45,159
You know where I was recently?
What are you talking about?

2443
01:48:45,219 --> 01:48:46,823
I was in your boyfriend's
fucking car, all right?

2444
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:48,298
I saw your nail polish.

2445
01:48:52,793 --> 01:48:54,704
What's this I hear about
your curly-haired friend

2446
01:48:54,795 --> 01:48:56,138
working for the government?

2447
01:48:56,163 --> 01:48:57,233
Who says this? What are
you talking about?

2448
01:48:57,331 --> 01:48:58,469
Who said that? Who said that?
That's bullshit.

2449
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,533
That's bullshit.
Your fucking wife.

2450
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:00,668
That's...
Rosalyn?

2451
01:49:01,135 --> 01:49:04,480
He put a fucking
canvas bag over my head!

2452
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:06,579
Hey, hey, what the fuck?
Shut up.

2453
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:08,016
What...
Shut the fuck up.

2454
01:49:08,175 --> 01:49:09,483
Are you happy now?

2455
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,682
Because he is
trying to kill me!

2456
01:49:11,812 --> 01:49:13,519
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

2457
01:49:13,647 --> 01:49:15,649
What do you think you're doing'?
Huh? Get out of here!

2458
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:17,729
I'm not doing anything! Why
are you talking so much?

2459
01:49:17,818 --> 01:49:19,422
You're gonna get us
all killed! Danny.

2460
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:21,560
Come here, buddy.
All right.

2461
01:49:21,655 --> 01:49:23,601
Go draw a picture
or something. All right'?

2462
01:49:23,690 --> 01:49:25,067
You are a sick
son of a bitch

2463
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:27,435
for screaming at me like
that in front of Danny.

2464
01:49:27,528 --> 01:49:29,064
Attaboy, all right?

2465
01:49:29,163 --> 01:49:31,769
I'm a sick son of a bitch? You're
trying to get me fucking killed.

2466
01:49:31,865 --> 01:49:33,742
I'm a sick son of a bitch?
Oh, my God!

2467
01:49:33,834 --> 01:49:36,075
You drive me so fucking crazy.
What are you doing?

2468
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:39,583
Your boyfriend, your fucking
boyfriend will kill me,

2469
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,550
he will kill Danny,
and he'll kill you.

2470
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:43,518
Stop talking like that. That's
who you're dealing with.

2471
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:45,523
He's a mobster, all right?
That's who you're dealing with.

2472
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:47,058
What do you think
you're doing?

2473
01:49:47,181 --> 01:49:48,683
Stop, all right? Fine!
What are you doing to us?

2474
01:49:48,749 --> 01:49:51,696
Yes, I wanted to hurt you, but
how do you think that I feel?

2475
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:54,596
All day when you leave
me alone, all day,

2476
01:49:54,688 --> 01:49:58,101
and all I've ever wanted
you to do is love me.

2477
01:49:58,192 --> 01:50:00,194
That's all I've
ever wanted is for us

2478
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,638
to stay married and
for you to love me.

2479
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:03,969
And that's why
I'm going to Miami!

2480
01:50:04,098 --> 01:50:06,100
You're not going to Miami.
That's why I'm going to Miami

2481
01:50:06,233 --> 01:50:07,473
with Pete! You're
not going to Miami!

2482
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,548
You are not going to Miami!
I'm going to Miami with Pete!

2483
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:12,106
I finally found
somebody who loves me!

2484
01:50:12,206 --> 01:50:14,049
Just like
you've always wanted!

2485
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:16,088
Too fucking dangerous.
Miami, not now!

2486
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:17,951
He likes me just the way I am.
Too fucking dangerous.

2487
01:50:18,045 --> 01:50:20,116
You're gonna stay normal. You're
gonna shut your fucking mouth.

2488
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:23,320
You told me that you wanted
me to find a nice, quiet man.

2489
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:24,452
He's the one.

2490
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:26,224
Oh, and what
a doozy you picked.

2491
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,630
Oh, you hit that...

2492
01:50:28,722 --> 01:50:30,292
He's the most
dangerous guy ever.

2493
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:31,835
Well, what do you
expect, Irving?

2494
01:50:31,925 --> 01:50:33,927
I know everybody
through you!

2495
01:50:33,994 --> 01:50:36,235
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

2496
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,903
Why are you taking your heart pill?
Irving' what's going on?

2497
01:50:45,172 --> 01:50:46,776
Irving, take your pill.

2498
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:50,254
What kind of trouble are you in, Irving?
What is going on?

2499
01:50:50,611 --> 01:50:52,090
What's happening?

2500
01:50:57,451 --> 01:50:59,089
I got a plan.

2501
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:02,531
You got a plan?
When did you get it?

2502
01:51:02,623 --> 01:51:04,102
You know what'?

2503
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,765
It really fucking
came to me

2504
01:51:09,263 --> 01:51:11,436
when I was inside
of that canvas bag,

2505
01:51:12,132 --> 01:51:17,013
with your boyfriend's
hands around my throat

2506
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:19,541
Yeah, that's when
it really came to me.

2507
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:21,346
Take the fucking bag off his head.
We got two million...

2508
01:51:21,441 --> 01:51:23,045
We got two million
coming this week.

2509
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,656
You see? Come on! What
do you think this is?

2510
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:26,850
You think this is a fucking
down payment plan?

2511
01:51:26,947 --> 01:51:28,790
What,
we're Sears or Chevrolet?

2512
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,527
You ask Victor

2513
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:35,731
if he wants
two million this week.

2514
01:51:35,822 --> 01:51:38,359
That's real money.
That's real money.

2515
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:39,960
Two million?
Two million this week.

2516
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:41,700
How?

2517
01:51:42,129 --> 01:51:43,369
Wired in.

2518
01:51:43,463 --> 01:51:44,533
Hold,
hold on to the scarf.

2519
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:45,632
Irving,
come on, you all right'?

2520
01:51:47,634 --> 01:51:49,238
That true? Is it true what
he said about your wife?

2521
01:51:49,303 --> 01:51:51,044
It's not fucking true. That's not...
About Rosalyn?

2522
01:51:51,305 --> 01:51:54,650
I can save all of us,
and we could save money.

2523
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:58,979
I can take care of
you and Danny, okay?

2524
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:00,684
But you got to
close your mouth.

2525
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,085
I knew it.

2526
01:52:03,183 --> 01:52:04,560
I have always said, Irving,

2527
01:52:04,651 --> 01:52:07,825
that you are very, very hard
to motivate properly.

2528
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:10,862
And I knew that Pete
was gonna go over there

2529
01:52:10,924 --> 01:52:12,494
and knock some
sense into your head.

2530
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:14,505
I've been reading
this book, Irving.

2531
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:17,269
It's by Wayne Dyer, about
the power of intention.

2532
01:52:19,333 --> 01:52:22,280
And my intention in
sending Pete over to you

2533
01:52:22,369 --> 01:52:24,610
was so that you could
come up with this plan.

2534
01:52:24,705 --> 01:52:26,343
So you're welcome.

2535
01:52:31,011 --> 01:52:32,251
Okay.

2536
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:35,523
Thank you, Rosalyn.
Thank you for the plan.

2537
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,583
You're welcome.

2538
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:39,220
I appreciate that.
So, uh...

2539
01:52:41,355 --> 01:52:43,596
I think that we should
be partners on this.

2540
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:46,102
Yeah, I'm a good partner,
almost better than Edith.

2541
01:52:46,193 --> 01:52:47,228
You ever think
about that?

2542
01:52:47,294 --> 01:52:49,797
You ever think about how you
might have underestimated me?

2543
01:52:49,896 --> 01:52:51,136
So what is our plan?

2544
01:52:52,366 --> 01:52:53,709
Tell me the plan.

2545
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:56,041
What are you gonna do?

2546
01:52:56,803 --> 01:52:58,783
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut,
and I'm not gonna say anything,

2547
01:52:58,872 --> 01:53:01,409
but what do I do if Pete calls
me, what am I supposed to say?

2548
01:53:01,475 --> 01:53:03,477
You got to stop talking about
your government agencies,

2549
01:53:03,577 --> 01:53:05,614
and your IRS and your taxes
and your conspiracies,

2550
01:53:05,712 --> 01:53:07,783
and all of that, you're gonna
say how you were wrong.

2551
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:08,951
You were wrong about that.

2552
01:53:09,049 --> 01:53:10,824
I'll tell Pete
that I was wrong,

2553
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:12,453
but you know
that in real life,

2554
01:53:12,552 --> 01:53:14,054
I was right for
saying all that stuff

2555
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,897
because then that spurred on the actions
that made you come up with this plan.

2556
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:19,468
So I will tell Pete.
Okay.

2557
01:53:19,559 --> 01:53:21,470
The power of intention,
Irving.

2558
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:23,063
The power of intention.

2559
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,131
Thank you.

2560
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:26,108
Okay, okay.

2561
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,675
You were right.
Irv?

2562
01:53:28,769 --> 01:53:29,907
Irv?

2563
01:53:36,677 --> 01:53:38,088
You're so smart.

2564
01:53:39,413 --> 01:53:41,120
Good job, peaches.

2565
01:53:41,181 --> 01:53:44,253
Irving, I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

2566
01:53:47,254 --> 01:53:49,530
And you need to grow up,

2567
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:52,464
and you need
to face the facts,

2568
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:55,870
and I think that both of us
will be a lot happier

2569
01:53:55,962 --> 01:53:57,270
if we get a divorce.

2570
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:00,805
Okay.

2571
01:54:00,867 --> 01:54:02,437
Just think about it.

2572
01:54:04,104 --> 01:54:05,879
These things
are never easy.

2573
01:54:08,542 --> 01:54:09,816
All right.

2574
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:16,655
Irving?

2575
01:54:18,285 --> 01:54:19,958
Good luck with your plan.

2576
01:54:21,788 --> 01:54:25,395
Necessity truly
is the mother of invention.

2577
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:28,500
The FBI was willing
to wire the $2 million

2578
01:54:28,562 --> 01:54:31,839
if it meant taking down Tellegio
and his entire organization.

“Boy, you ain't goin' nowhere "

never meet at the Plaza Hotel,

2581

but only at the office
of his attorney,

Hi. Alfonse Simone.

2595
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:49,379
Edith Greensly.

2596
01:55:49,443 --> 01:55:50,945
Alfonse Simone.
Hey.

2597
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:52,785
Hi. Alfonse Simone.
Irving Rosenfeld.

2598
01:55:52,879 --> 01:55:54,051
Please, uh, be seated.

2599
01:55:54,114 --> 01:55:56,116
I appreciate the fact that
you all came in person,

2600
01:55:56,216 --> 01:55:58,127
but, uh, the trip
was really unnecessary,

2601
01:55:58,218 --> 01:56:01,893
because this whole thing could've been
done with a simple wire transfer.

2602
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,161
As a matter of fact,

2603
01:56:03,256 --> 01:56:05,258
this is the number
of our wire right here.

2604
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,335
Where is Mr. Tellegio?

2605
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:13,809
Mr. Tellegio, unfortunately, was
called out of town on business'

2606
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:15,072
Oh, that's not good.

2607
01:56:15,235 --> 01:56:17,237
You know, we were willing
to come here today in person

2608
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:19,784
to meet with Mr. Tellegio
as a sign of respect

2609
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,319
lo give $2 million...
Well, listen,

2610
01:56:21,408 --> 01:56:24,480
I can assure you that I have
the power of attorney...

2611
01:56:24,578 --> 01:56:26,649
Excuse me, if you'll let me finish.
We were willing

2612
01:56:26,746 --> 01:56:28,987
to give $2 million
today of the ten,

2613
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:31,418
but without
Mr. Tellegio here...

2614
01:56:31,485 --> 01:56:33,192
We can't make
that decision.

2615
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:34,993
We can't do that?
It's not the right thing.

2616
01:56:35,088 --> 01:56:37,534
It's just not the right time.
It's just not good.

2617
01:56:37,958 --> 01:56:40,461
You don't have the authorization
to make this kind of choice,

2618
01:56:40,527 --> 01:56:41,767
so don't be hasty,
all right?

2619
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:43,171
Not being hasty.

2620
01:56:43,263 --> 01:56:45,174
Just, let's be smart
about it, all right?

2621
01:56:45,265 --> 01:56:47,108
This is not how we do
business. I'm sorry.

2622
01:56:48,602 --> 01:56:50,275
Apologize,
but it's true.

2623
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,520
I think you should
hang in there, all right?

2624
01:56:57,143 --> 01:56:58,986
For what?
The guy's not here.

2625
01:56:59,045 --> 01:57:00,046
Edith...
That's it.

2626
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:01,454
You know what?
Sorry, I can't do it.

2627
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:04,155
This is a surprise. The
sheik don't like surprises.

2628
01:57:04,217 --> 01:57:05,525
Don't leave.

2629
01:57:05,619 --> 01:57:07,155
Edith,

2630
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,029
this is not your
decision to make.

2631
01:57:09,155 --> 01:57:10,828
It's not your decision. No,
I understand, but maybe

2632
01:57:10,957 --> 01:57:12,300
What?
Let's go.

2633
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:13,804
Let's call the sheik.

2634
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:17,641
It's not the plan.
It's not the...

2635
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:19,074
No, let's...

2636
01:57:19,165 --> 01:57:20,872
I'll call the sheik, yeah.
Can I use your phone?

2637
01:57:20,967 --> 01:57:22,708
Please do. Let's see. I
don't know if he's in,

2638
01:57:22,802 --> 01:57:23,872
but I'll call the sheik.

2639
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,711
But before I do,
I'd like to go over,

2640
01:57:25,805 --> 01:57:28,376
specifically, what this
money will be used for.

2641
01:57:28,475 --> 01:57:29,476
Okay.

2642
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:32,046
What we will do
is we guarantee

2643
01:57:32,145 --> 01:57:34,989
all proper licenses
and construction permits

2644
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:37,324
for any hotel-casino

2645
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:40,029
that plans to open
before the end of the year,

2646
01:57:40,086 --> 01:57:44,501
and we'll throw in the customary,
uh, privileges of protection.

2647
01:57:45,025 --> 01:57:47,005
What if there's obstacles?

2648
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,266
What will you do?
Obstacles...

2649
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:50,034
We are prepared to
overcome any obstacles.

2650
01:57:50,096 --> 01:57:51,166
This is a big enterprise.

2651
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:54,405
If we have to pay somebody
off, we'll pay somebody off.

2652
01:57:54,501 --> 01:57:56,071
If we have to
lean on somebody,

2653
01:57:56,169 --> 01:57:58,445
intimidate somebody,
we'll intimidate somebody.

2654
01:57:58,538 --> 01:58:01,109
We're experienced.
This is our business.

2655
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:02,709
That's powerful stuff.

2656
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:04,844
Thank you. And I'll tell
you something else.

2657
01:58:04,945 --> 01:58:08,119
At the end of this, we'll
teach you how to skim

2658
01:58:08,214 --> 01:58:10,888
and how to cut it up and
make some money on the side,

2659
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:12,953
because we invented skimming.

2660
01:58:13,053 --> 01:58:15,055
We've been doing
it for 30 years.

2661
01:58:15,121 --> 01:58:17,362
Thank you, thank you
for clarifying that.

2662
01:58:17,424 --> 01:58:18,926
Okay.

2663
01:58:19,025 --> 01:58:20,561
I'm very happy-

2664
01:58:22,796 --> 01:58:24,639
I think that'll be
okay for the sheik.

2665
01:58:26,866 --> 01:58:27,936
This is the sheik.

2666
01:58:28,034 --> 01:58:29,604
Mr. Tellegio is not here.

2667
01:58:29,703 --> 01:58:31,979
It's just Mr. Alfonse Simone,
his lawyer.

2668
01:58:32,072 --> 01:58:33,949
Are we still okay
to wire the money?

2669
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,644
Simone can take the wire.
What's the number?

2670
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:37,110
531...

2671
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:38,245
531...

2672
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:39,949
78P...
78P...

2673
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:42,253
76.
76.

2674
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:45,090
The funds are transferred.

2675
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:47,062
The funds
have transferred.

2676
01:58:47,921 --> 01:58:49,423
The money's been wired.

2677
01:58:52,559 --> 01:58:53,594
I think we have a deal.

2678
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:54,661
Yes,we do, sir.

2679
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,570
Pleasure doing
business with you.

2680
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:58,576
Okay, well, thank you
very much, Mr. Simone.

2681
01:58:58,632 --> 01:58:59,770
Well, thank you.

2682
01:58:59,833 --> 01:59:01,278
The sheik's very excited.

2683
01:59:01,334 --> 01:59:03,007
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other.

2684
01:59:03,103 --> 01:59:04,980
Oh, I'm sure that we'll be
seeing each other very soon.

2685
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:06,141
Looking forward to it.

2686
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:07,274
Yeah, so am I.

2687
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:08,842
You might even
get sick of me.

2688
01:59:09,442 --> 01:59:10,580
Like these two.

2689
01:59:10,644 --> 01:59:11,816
I don't think
I'll get sick of you.

2690
01:59:11,911 --> 01:59:13,913
Thank you very much.
Bye.

2691
01:59:15,415 --> 01:59:17,292
Good-bye.
Nice meeting you.

2692
01:59:28,762 --> 01:59:31,208
How did that happen?
How did that happen?

2693
01:59:31,297 --> 01:59:33,140
I mean,
how did that happen?

2694
01:59:33,933 --> 01:59:37,039
Finally! Finally,
we're getting some respect

2695
01:59:37,137 --> 01:59:38,548
We're getting
some respect finally!

2696
01:59:38,638 --> 01:59:40,174
It's you and me!
It's...

2697
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:41,616
We're ambitious.
That's why.

2698
01:59:41,775 --> 01:59:44,654
Whoa. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2699
01:59:44,711 --> 01:59:46,281
ALFONSE  If we
have to pay somebody off,

2700
01:59:46,346 --> 01:59:47,723
we'll pay somebody off.

2701
01:59:47,814 --> 01:59:50,727
If we have to lean on somebody,
intimidate somebody”.

2702
01:59:50,817 --> 01:59:53,457
"We'll intimidate somebody!"

2703
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:59,462
I'm kissing his boo-boos!
I'm kissing his boo-boos!

2704
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:00,664
Oh, come on!

2705
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:33,902
Yeah, well, I got to do it.

2706
02:00:37,497 --> 02:00:39,875
What do you mean, there's no sheik'?
What does that mean?

2707
02:00:39,933 --> 02:00:41,606
"There's no sheik"?

2708
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:46,841
I want to face you like a man
because I want to be real now.

2709
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:48,442
All right?
Who is "they"?

2710
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,356
Who is "they"?
"They" is the feds.

2711
02:00:53,413 --> 02:00:55,188
The feds?
Yeah.

2712
02:00:56,182 --> 02:00:57,627
Irving...

2713
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:02,092
Look...
I'm a good person.

2714
02:01:02,188 --> 02:01:03,633
You're a good person.

2715
02:01:03,723 --> 02:01:06,533
I've been doing this for a
long time, for 20 years.

2716
02:01:07,761 --> 02:01:09,365
Do you think I would
have taken that money

2717
02:01:09,429 --> 02:01:10,772
if it wasn't
the right thing to do?

2718
02:01:11,197 --> 02:01:12,733
Hey, look... Look. Huh?

2719
02:01:12,799 --> 02:01:14,642
You're a good person.
I know that. I know.

2720
02:01:14,768 --> 02:01:17,374
But in all honesty... You said
that was the only way, Irv.

2721
02:01:17,437 --> 02:01:19,781
You chased me,
you remember?

2722
02:01:19,873 --> 02:01:21,614
They fucking made me do it.
What's a guy to do?

2723
02:01:21,708 --> 02:01:22,948
They had Syd in jail.
Whoa, whoa.

2724
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:24,487
You made me go
back to the Plaza

2725
02:01:24,577 --> 02:01:26,614
to take that money,
you piece of shit!

2726
02:01:26,713 --> 02:01:28,590
I was gone!

2727
02:01:28,648 --> 02:01:30,457
You fucking prick!
I know. I know. I know.

2728
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:31,722
You motherfucker!

2729
02:01:31,785 --> 02:01:34,391
You fucking chased me,
you piece of shit!

2730
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:35,762
Carmine? Honey?

2731
02:01:35,822 --> 02:01:37,062
I was gone! I left!

2732
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:39,802
Everything all right'? Please,
Dolly, just go upstairs.

2733
02:01:39,893 --> 02:01:41,668
Ali right, I'll go upstairs.
Take the kids and go upstairs.

2734
02:01:41,795 --> 02:01:43,832
Please. Please, just go.
Of course. Of course.

2735
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:47,411
I want to make this right. I came
here because I want to make it right.

2736
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:48,639
Look at my face.

2737
02:01:49,002 --> 02:01:51,141
You tell me that
I'm lying to you

2738
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:53,641
when I say that
everything I do

2739
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:56,311
is for the good of
the people of New Jersey.

2740
02:01:57,277 --> 02:02:00,747
Everything I do is for them.

2741
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:04,951
Am I lying to you?

2742
02:02:05,018 --> 02:02:06,964
I never had a friend
like you before.

2743
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:11,967
I used that money
for the goddamn casino.

2744
02:02:14,594 --> 02:02:17,268
I got some fucking
leverage, all right?

2745
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:18,968
I can help you out.

2746
02:02:19,032 --> 02:02:20,477
This is all shit.
It's all bullshit.

2747
02:02:21,201 --> 02:02:22,839
Look at this thing.

2748
02:02:22,936 --> 02:02:24,210
Look at this.

2749
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:29,043
Ceremonial fucking knife. What,
is this bullshit? Some icy?

2750
02:02:32,946 --> 02:02:35,290
Carmine, Syd and I got
a plan for you. Yeah?

2751
02:02:35,348 --> 02:02:37,123
We can help you out.

2752
02:02:38,051 --> 02:02:40,122
Please get out of
my house, Irving.

2753
02:02:40,186 --> 02:02:43,133
Will you please leave? I'm
asking you nicely, please leave.

2754
02:02:44,324 --> 02:02:46,304
Get out of my house. Go!

2755
02:02:46,626 --> 02:02:47,627
Get out of our house!

2756
02:02:47,794 --> 02:02:48,829
I don't wanna...

2757
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:52,308
Oh, fuck.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2758
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,507
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

2759
02:02:54,567 --> 02:02:55,841
You break my
motherfucking heart,

2760
02:02:55,969 --> 02:02:57,243
Irving,
right in front of my family.

2761
02:02:57,337 --> 02:02:58,372
Go, go, go up
to the bedroom.

2762
02:02:58,471 --> 02:03:01,577
This is what matters to me most,
and you're crushing that.

2763
02:03:01,674 --> 02:03:02,846
You're going to
take me away from them?

2764
02:03:02,909 --> 02:03:04,183
I didn't want
this to happen ever.

2765
02:03:04,244 --> 02:03:05,587
Fucking son of a bitch!
Get the fuck out.

2766
02:03:05,678 --> 02:03:06,884
Oh, my God! Stop!

2767
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:08,687
- You son of a bitch!
- Dad, stop!

2768
02:03:08,748 --> 02:03:10,056
I just want
to make it right.

2769
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:11,253
Just get out of my house.

2770
02:03:11,351 --> 02:03:13,058
Look what you made me do.
Please go.

2771
02:03:13,152 --> 02:03:14,825
I'm sorry, Carmine.
Oh, my God.

2772
02:03:14,888 --> 02:03:16,731
lam. I'm sorry.

2773
02:03:16,823 --> 02:03:18,496
Get out of here!
Get out!

2774
02:03:18,558 --> 02:03:19,730
Will you just get out?

2775
02:03:19,826 --> 02:03:21,897
Please go. Please leave.
Please leave.

2776
02:03:21,995 --> 02:03:24,236
Oh, God. No, Carmine.

2777
02:03:24,330 --> 02:03:25,400
What's happening?
It'll be all right.

2778
02:03:26,232 --> 02:03:28,337
No, no.

2779
02:03:29,002 --> 02:03:31,949
Oh, my God, no!

2780
02:03:33,339 --> 02:03:34,909
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
SYDNEY; Irving?

2781
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:38,518
Irving, are you all right?

2782
02:03:39,512 --> 02:03:40,752
Where are
your heart pills?

2783
02:03:40,847 --> 02:03:42,724
Where are your heart pills?
In the pocket. Inside.

2784
02:03:43,116 --> 02:03:44,754
Here. There you go.

2785
02:03:44,851 --> 02:03:46,228
Are you all right?

2786
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,200
Okay. Come with me.
Come on.

2787
02:03:51,357 --> 02:03:52,802
Come on.

2788
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:57,037
Come on, just walk.

2789
02:03:57,096 --> 02:03:58,598
Come on. You okay?

2790
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:02,236
I got to lay down.

2791
02:04:02,702 --> 02:04:04,613
Okay?

2792
02:04:04,704 --> 02:04:06,115
Just rest.

2793
02:04:29,996 --> 02:04:31,998
You ready?
Yeah.

2794
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:36,312
I love you.

2795
02:04:54,153 --> 02:04:56,633
Please. Come in, sit down.

2796
02:05:08,634 --> 02:05:10,671
You know where
our $2 million is?

2797
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,511
Two million?
Yeah.

2798
02:05:12,605 --> 02:05:15,347
It's with, uh, Victor
Tellegio and Alfonse Simone.

2799
02:05:15,441 --> 02:05:19,014
No, actually, it's not with Victor
Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.

2800
02:05:19,846 --> 02:05:21,052
He fucking knows about it.

2801
02:05:21,147 --> 02:05:22,524
Ifs gone missing.

2802
02:05:22,615 --> 02:05:23,787
Did you know that?

2803
02:05:24,384 --> 02:05:25,556
No, I knew
nothing about that

2804
02:05:25,651 --> 02:05:26,652
Where's it gone'?

2805
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:28,665
Well, that's interesting
that you say that, because,

2806
02:05:28,721 --> 02:05:30,029
while you were on
your way over here,

2807
02:05:30,123 --> 02:05:34,731
we got an anonymous
phone call from someone

2808
02:05:35,395 --> 02:05:40,708
who said that, in exchange for
immunity for the two of you

2809
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:44,304
and a reduced
sentence for Carmine Polito,

2810
02:05:45,138 --> 02:05:46,879
we get our $2 million back.

2811
02:05:48,174 --> 02:05:50,586
That's interesting.
That's very interesting.

2812
02:05:51,044 --> 02:05:52,990
I have no idea.
No idea?

2813
02:05:53,046 --> 02:05:54,821
No idea what
you're talking about.

2814
02:05:55,148 --> 02:05:56,183
I get it.

2815
02:05:56,249 --> 02:05:58,092
I understand how these
deals are made, right?

2816
02:05:58,184 --> 02:06:00,221
See, someone has leverage.

2817
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:01,423
Anthony, fuck them.
Fuck them. It's over.

2818
02:06:01,521 --> 02:06:02,591
I don't think so.

2819
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:04,258
We got them for wire fraud.
It's over. You're done.

2820
02:06:04,357 --> 02:06:05,836
You're both done. You're done.
No, I don't think so.

2821
02:06:05,892 --> 02:06:07,496
I don't think so.
Oh, you don't think so?

2822
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,564
Richard, you requested
the two million.

2823
02:06:11,364 --> 02:06:13,844
And you gave Brenda
the account number.

2824
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,106
No, no.

2825
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:16,508
We didn't do any of that.

2826
02:06:17,336 --> 02:06:18,747
None of it.

2827
02:06:19,338 --> 02:06:21,682
How do we know that
you don't have the money?

2828
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:23,918
Am I living in a fucking
nightmare right now?

2829
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:25,182
I find this
a little offensive.

2830
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:27,451
Really, I find this
a little offensive,

2831
02:06:27,547 --> 02:06:28,548
and I don't see that
you got any sort of

2832
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:30,524
Don't let him get in your head.

2833
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:31,926
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

2834
02:06:32,018 --> 02:06:33,258
We're dealing with
a very clever individual.

2835
02:06:33,352 --> 02:06:34,888
Don't let him...
Richard. Richard.

2836
02:06:35,688 --> 02:06:37,531
Think about it, all right?

2837
02:06:38,524 --> 02:06:40,197
You got some big arrests.

2838
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:42,705
You got U.S. congressmen.
You look good.

2839
02:06:43,029 --> 02:06:45,031
You're going to be
all over the news.

2840
02:06:45,798 --> 02:06:47,209
You know what
doesn't look good?

2841
02:06:47,767 --> 02:06:49,644
A story about
gross incompetence.

2842
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:51,638
I have a warrant for...

2843
02:06:51,737 --> 02:06:54,115
Sorry,
do I have the wrong office?

2844
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:57,782
This 701? Alfonse Simone?

2845
02:06:57,877 --> 02:06:59,049
This is 701.

2846
02:06:59,612 --> 02:07:02,821
My name is Roger Thigpen. I've
had this office for 25 years.

2847
02:07:02,915 --> 02:07:04,326
I'm a divorce attorney.

2848
02:07:08,888 --> 02:07:10,993
You lost $2
million of taxpayer money

2849
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:13,263
because you were confused
about the location

2850
02:07:13,326 --> 02:07:16,273
and the identity of
Victor Tellegio's attorney?

2851
02:07:16,929 --> 02:07:18,499
The role of
Tellegio's attorney,

2852
02:07:18,598 --> 02:07:21,602
Alfonse Simone, was played
by our friend, Ed Malone,

2853
02:07:21,667 --> 02:07:23,669
the Cold Cut
King of Long Island,

2854
02:07:23,769 --> 02:07:27,239
whose party we were at
when Sydney and I first met.

2855
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,319
Alfonse Simone.

2856
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:32,521
People believe what they
want to believe, Richie.

2857
02:07:32,612 --> 02:07:35,354
No, because you conned me. That's
why, because you both fucking con...

2858
02:07:35,448 --> 02:07:36,483
You got under me.
You did.

2859
02:07:36,582 --> 02:07:38,152
You know, that, uh...

2860
02:07:38,251 --> 02:07:40,595
That doesn't sound so good,
either, right there.

2861
02:07:40,653 --> 02:07:42,655
You know, I mean, and I don't
know what you're talking about,

2862
02:07:42,755 --> 02:07:46,202
but let's just assume you
want to go with that story.

2863
02:07:46,292 --> 02:07:47,771
Really?

2864
02:07:47,827 --> 02:07:49,932
That's the story
you want to go with?

2865
02:07:49,996 --> 02:07:50,997
All right?

2866
02:07:51,097 --> 02:07:54,203
That's what you want
the New York Times to hear?

2867
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:59,540
That you got conned
by the very con men

2868
02:08:00,606 --> 02:08:05,555
who you forced to entrap the members
of Congress in the first place?

2869
02:08:06,112 --> 02:08:07,284
That's what you
want to go with?

2870
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:10,452
That doesn't sound so good
for your whole thing, does it?

2871
02:08:11,117 --> 02:08:16,066
And how ironic that the ones
who were working hardest

2872
02:08:16,155 --> 02:08:19,034
to get the economy
of New Jersey going,

2873
02:08:20,126 --> 02:08:22,367
those are the ones
that you round up.

2874
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:23,496
And why'? Why?

2875
02:08:23,563 --> 02:08:25,975
Because, what, they're the
easiest to go after'?

2876
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,873
And what about
the real bullshit artists?

2877
02:08:30,803 --> 02:08:33,374
You didn't even come close
to the big leagues.

2878
02:08:33,472 --> 02:08:35,418
Those big guys,
the money men.

2879
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:39,515
That's what I was
trying to go after.

2880
02:08:39,579 --> 02:08:41,855
I'm sorry to tell you,
you got none of them.

2881
02:08:47,253 --> 02:08:49,494
You know, Richie,
I think, uh...

2882
02:08:50,323 --> 02:08:52,064
We may call you as a witness,
but otherwise you're done.

2883
02:08:52,158 --> 02:08:54,001
I think you better go home.

2884
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:56,864
Go on home, Richard.

2885
02:09:13,012 --> 02:09:14,923
We took down
some very big guys.

2886
02:09:15,014 --> 02:09:17,927
Some of whom, they were
just doing business as usual,

2887
02:09:18,017 --> 02:09:20,054
helping their
communities or their states,

2888
02:09:21,053 --> 02:09:24,398
but some of them knew they
had larceny in their blood.

2889
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:26,431
And they even admitted it.

2890
02:09:26,525 --> 02:09:29,369
But in all,
it was six congressmen,

2891
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:31,408
one United States senator

2892
02:09:32,865 --> 02:09:34,936
and my friend, Carmine Polito.

2893
02:09:38,404 --> 02:09:40,247
We gave the two million back,

2894
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:43,719
so Carmine got the reduced
sentence, 18 months.

2895
02:09:45,878 --> 02:09:47,721
The loss of his friendship

2896
02:09:48,614 --> 02:09:50,719
would haunt me
for the rest of my life.

2897
02:09:53,919 --> 02:09:55,956
And when
the story was written,

2898
02:09:56,555 --> 02:09:59,729
Richard DiMaso's name
was never mentioned.

2899
02:10:12,104 --> 02:10:14,106
Syd and I,
we moved in together.

2900
02:10:15,908 --> 02:10:17,478
Rosalyn...

2901
02:10:17,576 --> 02:10:20,147
The car is a little dinged
up, I'm a little stiff,

2902
02:10:20,246 --> 02:10:22,658
but whatever, I don't
want to talk about it.

2903
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:25,925
She would always
be interesting.

2904
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:29,997
You know, my boss knows
you did him a solid.

2905
02:10:30,089 --> 02:10:31,090
Yes, I did.

2906
02:10:31,157 --> 02:10:34,036
He never took a nickel, so they
can't get him for nothing.

2907
02:10:34,593 --> 02:10:36,129
I was never going
to let that happen.

2908
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:38,306
All right.
Irv.

2909
02:10:44,203 --> 02:10:46,205
I'm done with
that nail finish.

2910
02:10:46,305 --> 02:10:48,615
Bye for now.
I'll see you next weekend.

2911
02:10:53,012 --> 02:10:55,014
Hey. Look at you.

2912
02:10:55,114 --> 02:10:57,560
I think your mom got your nose.
Is it okay that I wipe that?

2913
02:10:57,650 --> 02:10:59,960
Our conning
days were behind us.

2914
02:11:02,021 --> 02:11:03,967

02:11:09,729 --> 02:11:12,471
This one is abstract expressionism.
I love it 'cause these ones...

2918
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:16,172
