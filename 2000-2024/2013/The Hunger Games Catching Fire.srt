1
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,746
Easy.

2
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,461
Saw some turkeys on the way here.

3
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,006
Crossed right in front of me
like I wasn't even there.

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,884
How rude of them.

5
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:34,053
That's what happens when you spend
six days a week working in the mines.

6
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,681
Stupid birds start to think
they own these woods.

7
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,145
When's the tour leave?

8
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:43,980
Couple hours.

9
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,483
Well, let's go.

10
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,579
Hey!

11
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,915
- Hey. You're okay.
- Let go!

12
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,378
You're okay. You're safe.

13
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,089
It's okay. You're here with me.

14
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,423
You're with me.

15
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,057
Okay, okay.

16
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:03,059
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,274
We should...

18
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,111
We should go.

19
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,091
<i>Are you coming to the
train station?</i>

20
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,177
I think you have enough people
saying goodbye without me there.

21
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,430
Only a few I actually care about.

22
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,142
It might be easier if I didn't.

23
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,689
It's only a few weeks.
I'll be back before the snow melts.

24
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,900
A lot can happen in a few weeks.

25
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,235
Are we gonna do this again?

26
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,195
Gale, it was an act.

27
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,697
Yeah, it was a good one.

28
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:02,035
I did what I had to do to survive.
If I didn't, I'd be dead.

29
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,046
I had to do that.

30
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,132
At least once.

31
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,037
Haymitch!

32
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,417
Haymitch!

33
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,593
Haymitch, wake up. It's Tour Day.

34
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,054
Haymitch.

35
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,487
What are you doing?

36
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,072
Cameras are gonna be here in an hour.

37
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,160
If you wanted to be babied,
you should've asked Peeta.

38
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,704
Asked me what?

39
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,581
Asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia.

40
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,919
You are a strangely
dislikeable person.

41
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,215
But you do have your virtues.

42
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,467
Would you like some bread, Katniss?

43
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,053
No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you.

44
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,304
You're welcome.

45
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,769
You two have a lot of warming
up to do before show time.

46
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:55,940
Which is in an hour,
so take a bath, Haymitch.

47
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,234
I just did.

48
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,744
Did you have a good walk, dear?

49
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,288
- Walk? I was just out
- We have visitors.

50
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,459
Miss Everdeen. This way, please.

51
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,309
Such bravery.

52
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,103
Such spirit.

53
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:35,772
Such...

54
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,484
Contempt.

55
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,528
President Snow.

56
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,073
What an honor.

57
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:48,034
My dear, I think we can make this
so much simpler

58
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,912
if we agree not to lie to each other.
What do you think?

59
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,872
Yes, I think that would save time.

60
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,332
Sit down, please.

61
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,511
I have a problem, Miss Everdeen.

62
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:11,641
A problem that began the moment you
revealed those poison berries in the arena.

63
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:15,853
If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane,
had had any brains at all,

64
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,731
he would have blown you to bits
then and there.

65
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,233
But here you are.

66
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,652
I expect you can guess where he is.

67
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,487
Yes, I think so.

68
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,615
After that fiasco,
there was nothing left to do

69
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,201
but to let you play out
your little scenario.

70
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,620
And you were very good.

71
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,124
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

72
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,126
Impressive. Truly.

73
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,461
You convinced the
people in The Capitol.

74
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:44,882
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

75
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,427
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

76
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:52,849
people viewed your little trick
with the berries as an act of defiance.

77
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,101
Not as an act of love.

78
00:07:55,184 --> 00:08:01,190
And if a girl from District 12 of all places can
defy The Capitol and walk away unharmed,

79
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,568
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

80
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:07,655
What is to prevent, say, an uprising?

81
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,700
That can lead to revolution.

82
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,995
And then, in a fraction of time,
the whole system collapses.

83
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:18,124
It must be a fragile system, if it can be
brought down by just a few berries.

84
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,876
Yes, it is, indeed.

85
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,545
But not in the way you imagine it.

86
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,130
How should I imagine?

87
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,341
You should imagine thousands
upon thousands of your people dead.

88
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:30,303
This town of yours reduced to ashes.

89
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,470
Imagine it gone.

90
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,680
Made radioactive.

91
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,517
Buried under dirt as if it had
never existed, like District 13.

92
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,440
You fought very hard in The Games,
Miss Everdeen.

93
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,568
But they were games.

94
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,362
Would you like to be in a real war?

95
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,447
No.

96
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,325
Good. Neither would I.

97
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,660
Did your mother make these?

98
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,121
Peeta.

99
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,249
He's a lovely boy.

100
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,418
Tell me.

101
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:09,133
At what point did he realize the depth
of your indifference towards him?

102
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,718
I'm not indifferent.

103
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,094
Don't lie!

104
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,679
You promised.

105
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,435
Why don't you just kill me now?

106
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,815
I don't want to kill you.

107
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,944
I want us to be friends.

108
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,321
But if not friends, then allies.

109
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,697
What do I need to do?

110
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:37,620
When you and Peeta are on tour, you need to smile.
You need to be grateful.

111
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:43,125
But, above all, you need to be madly,
prepared-to-end-it-all in love.

112
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,294
- You think you can manage that?
- Yes.

113
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,462
Yes, what?

114
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,131
- I'll convince them.
- No.

115
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,300
Convince me.

116
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,597
For you, Miss Everdeen.

117
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,647
Do convince me.

118
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,609
For the sake of your loved ones.

119
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,709
Stop.

120
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:26,961
Take it all in.

121
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,756
This is sacred ground.

122
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:34,510
History was made here.

123
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,224
You'll get used to the smell.

124
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,227
Hello!

125
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,523
There she is. My greatest triumph!

126
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,025
Our little superstar.

127
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,777
Sweetie, we've missed you.

128
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,487
What a cute little house.

129
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,364
So quaint, isn't it?

130
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,283
Of course, you've heard about Cinna?

131
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,451
What happened to Cinna?

132
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,788
Oh, dear, he's a fashion star.
You're his muse.

133
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,041
Everyone in The Capitol's wearing him.
Everyone.

134
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,876
- Everyone.
- Well, not everyone.

135
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:09,920
Cinna!

136
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,631
Katniss?

137
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,885
Katniss, is this your sister?

138
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,428
Oh, sweetie!

139
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,471
Are you okay?

140
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,889
Just adorable!

141
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,807
- Yeah.
- Ready to work?

142
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,560
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.

143
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,397
Welcome!

144
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:36,322
Last year, the 74th Hunger Games brought
us the greatest love story of our time.

145
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:43,287
Two brave young people, against all odds,
chose to die rather than to lose each other.

146
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,749
As a nation, we shared their agony.

147
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:51,087
But we had so little time
to revel in their joy.

148
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,838
It's time!

149
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,425
She's done, she's lovely.
We must feed the monster.

150
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,760
All right now.

151
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,596
<i>Let's go to District 12
and find our star-crossed lovers!</i>

152
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,931
You're excited. You're in love.

153
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,434
Big smiles for the camera
in three, two, one.

154
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,855
<i>There she is! Katniss Everdeen!
The Girl on Fire.</i>

155
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,991
<i>And there he is!
Peeta Mellark! The Baker's Boy.</i>

156
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,627
<i>Trouble in paradise.</i>

157
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,879
<i>I hope they're all right.</i>

158
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,345
<i>Anyone at home?
Should we come back later?</i>

159
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,973
<i>Sorry, Caesar.</i>

160
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,892
Please. It's all right.
It's your day.

161
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,186
<i>It's your day. So how's it going?</i>

162
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,397
We're good.

163
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,734
<i>That's it? That's all we get?
"We're good”?</i>

164
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:59,280
<i>So taciturn all of a sudden.
Peeta, give me some details!</i>

165
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,327
Yeah, things are great here in 12.

166
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,999
Thanks to the generosity of The
Capitol, we've never been closer.

167
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,501
Twenty-five yards, to be exact.

168
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,753
<i>Fantastic!</i>

169
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,257
We'll be checking in with both of you
throughout the Victory Tour.

170
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,343
<i>Thank you so much,
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!</i>

171
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,097
Wonderful!

172
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:28,017
Everybody in motion.
We are out of here in 10.

173
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,103
- That was nice acting.
- You, too.

174
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:33,522
Almost thought that kiss was real.

175
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,067
Come along, children,
we are on a schedule.

176
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,819
The train awaits!

177
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,117
<i>Fabulous food, fabulous wine,
the massages, spa treatments.</i>

178
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,537
I told them nothing but the
best for my two Victors.

179
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,456
It all needs to be...

180
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,749
Fabulous?

181
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:52,875
Exactly.

182
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,837
Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear.
12 days, 12 districts.

183
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:59,256
But it's mostly
parties, celebrations,

184
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,468
adoring fans to greet you
at every stop along the way,

185
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,720
and then we wrap it
up in The Capitol.

186
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,224
All you need to do is give a few
speeches, wave to the crowds,

187
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,476
and enjoy your time in the spotlight.

188
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,727
You've earned it.

189
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,312
What did you say?

190
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,813
Katniss.

191
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:19,276
I said, "Enjoy it, Katniss,
you've earned it."

192
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,403
By killing people-

193
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,407
Young lady...

194
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,266
I'm really not in the mood for a lecture.
I'll apologize to Effie later.

195
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,145
I thought you were Haymitch.

196
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,398
You don't have to
apologize to anybody.

197
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:58,857
Including me.

198
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:04,405
I know it's not fair of me to hold
you to things you said in The Games.

199
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,534
You saved us. I know that.

200
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:15,249
But I can't go on acting for the cameras, and
then just ignoring each other in real life.

201
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,838
So if you can stop looking at me like I'm
wounded, then I can quit acting like it.

202
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:26,093
And then maybe
we have a shot at being friends.

203
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,303
I've never been very good at friends.

204
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,141
For starters, it does help
when you know the person.

205
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,645
I hardly know anything about you except
that you're stubborn and good with a bow.

206
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,522
That about sums me up.

207
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:41,191
No, there's more than that,
you just don't want to tell me.

208
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,901
It's like I said, I'm...

209
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,570
See, Katniss, the way
the whole friend thing works

210
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,198
is you have to tell each
other the deep stuff.

211
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,825
- The deep stuff?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,076
Like what?

213
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,244
Like...

214
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,371
What's your favorite color?

215
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,789
Well, now you've
stepped over the line.

216
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,668
Seriously, though, what is it?

217
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,172
Green.

218
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,174
What's yours?

219
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,550
Orange.

220
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,512
- Like Effie's hair?
- No. Not that orange.

221
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,849
More like a sunset kind of orange.

222
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,614
Did you see that?

223
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,532
What?

224
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,641
Well, I never.

225
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,894
This is not very festive.

226
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,648
The mayor will make
some introductory remarks.

227
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,817
And then you just have
to say a few words.

228
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,029
It's customary, of course, to give a brief
eulogy to the district's fallen Tributes.

229
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:12,491
For 11, that's Thresh and Rue.

230
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,910
Here are the speeches.

231
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,415
I can do the talking if you want.

232
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,500
Thank you.

233
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,668
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

234
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,712
the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games.

235
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,758
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!

236
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,178
Smile, smile, smile, smile.
Stand up straight. You're on camera.

237
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,688
Thank you.

238
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,942
We're honored to be
here with you today.

239
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,487
And to be with the families
of your fallen Tributes.

240
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,291
He put down the cards.

241
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,335
<i>- Though they fought and lived with honor...
- Why do I bother?</i>

242
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,754
<i>...and dignity until the end,</i>

243
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,215
both Thresh and Rue

244
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,135
were so young.

245
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,806
But our lives aren't just
measured in years.

246
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,685
They're measured in the lives
of people we touch around us.

247
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,397
For myself,

248
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,983
for Katniss,

249
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:36,825
we know that without Rue and without
Thresh, we wouldn't be standing here today.

250
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:42,539
So in recognition of that, knowing that
it in no way can make up for your loss,

251
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:48,128
we'd like to donate one month of our
winnings to the families of the Tributes,

252
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,339
every year, for the rest of our lives.

253
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,299
Shit.

254
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,551
Can he do that?

255
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,846
He can't. But he did.

256
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,891
Why doesn't he just
stick to the cards?

257
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,559
Thank you.

258
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,826
I just wanted to say that
I didn't know Thresh.

259
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,536
I only spoke to him once.

260
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,207
He could have killed me,
but instead he showed me mercy.

261
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,835
That's a debt I'll never
be able to repay.

262
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,549
I did know Rue.

263
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,387
She wasn't just my ally,
she was my friend.

264
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:46,395
I see her in the flowers
that grow in the meadow by my house.

265
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,564
I hear her in a Mockingjay song.

266
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,403
I see her in my sister Prim.

267
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,241
She was too young,

268
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,744
too gentle.

269
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,582
And I couldn't save her.

270
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,087
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:38,947
No! No!

272
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,782
Wait! Wait!

273
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,909
No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

274
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,662
No! Let me go!
Please leave him alone!

275
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,747
No!

276
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,582
No!

277
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,000
No!

278
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,796
You! No, no, no!

279
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,798
Come here! Stop it!

280
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,175
Stop it! Stop!

281
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,426
What did I do?

282
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:00,635
Come on.

283
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,804
Shut up.

284
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,265
In all my years, I've never seen...

285
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,939
You two have a very simple task.

286
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,358
I never meant for anyone to get killed.
He has to know that.

287
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,943
What are you talking about?
Who has to know what?

288
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,987
Snow. He came to see me.

289
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,156
He's worried about rebellion
in the districts.

290
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,742
He thinks that
they don't believe our love story.

291
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,328
So he wants you to
make them believe it?

292
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,662
- To calm things down.
- You know, Katniss,

293
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,206
you shoulda told me that
before I went out there,

294
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,415
and tried to give these
people the money.

295
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,418
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.
He threatened to kill my family.

296
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,170
Well, I have family, too.

297
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,630
Okay? People that I need to protect.

298
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,924
What about them? Who protects them?

299
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,011
Katniss, what were you thinking?

300
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,387
I was thinking about Rue.

301
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,514
Haymitch, please...

302
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,349
Please, just help me
get through this trip.

303
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,101
Please, just help us
get through this.

304
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,061
This trip? Girl, wake up.

305
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,271
This trip doesn't end
when you get back home.

306
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,649
You never get off this train.

307
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,985
You two are mentors now.

308
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,780
That means that every year,
they're gonna drag you out,

309
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,783
and broadcast the details
of your romance.

310
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,120
Every year, your private
life becomes theirs.

311
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,664
From now on, your job
is to be a distraction.

312
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,625
So people forget what
the real problems are.

313
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,627
- So what do we do?
- You're gonna smile.

314
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:19,005
You're gonna read the cards
that Effie gives you.

315
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,883
And you're gonna live
happily ever after.

316
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,552
Think you can do that?

317
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,597
Yeah?

318
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,558
Come here.

319
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,776
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

320
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,364
<i>Katniss and I
want to share with you our victory.</i>

321
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,284
And our gratitude to The Capitol
for bringing us together.

322
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:51,371
It was the bond of love,
forged in the crucible of The Games

323
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,081
<i>that was our greatest prize.</i>

324
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:57,294
<i>For it is love and true love that
allows us all to bear our hardships.</i>

325
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:02,048
<i>That mends the heart and banishes
loneliness and gives meaning to our lives.</i>

326
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,636
We also want to share with you
the sorrows of your losses.

327
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,346
The Tributes of this...

328
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:20,150
The Tributes of this district
were brave and noble warriors.

329
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,986
They brought honor to their families
and pride to their people.

330
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:28,909
<i>We are all of us united, both victors and
vanquished, in serving a common purpose.</i>

331
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,495
Thank you.

332
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,790
One day, I'm gonna volunteer.
Just like you did.

333
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,717
It was just a dream. I'm sorry.

334
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,636
It's okay. I get 'em, too.

335
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,513
Goodnight.

336
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:51,890
Peeta.

337
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,268
Will you stay with me?

338
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,479
Yeah.

339
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,570
Always.

340
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:17,249
<i>We are all of us united,
both victors and vanquished,</i>

341
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,542
<i>in serving a common purpose.</i>

342
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,921
- The power and glory of The Capitol.
- Put down the cards!

343
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,422
Tell us what you really think!

344
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:29,261
Panem today. Panem tomorrow.
Panem forever.

345
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,608
Your hair looks lovely, darling.

346
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,695
When did you start
wearing it like that?

347
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,782
Everyone at school wears
it like this now, Grandpa.

348
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,788
Snow is watching us.

349
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,293
If he wants you to pacify the districts,
I promise you, he's not happy.

350
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:05,755
Instead of being in love, you two sound like
you're reciting from a drilling manual.

351
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,841
You try reading that stuff
that Effie writes us.

352
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:11,136
Tell that to President Snow
when you see him two days from now.

353
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,637
I'm open to suggestions.

354
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,431
We could get married.

355
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,766
That's not helping.

356
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,226
I'm serious.

357
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:22,939
If, like you said, we're on this train
forever, it's gonna happen eventually.

358
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,065
Why not now?

359
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,738
It does make a statement.
I'll give you that.

360
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,742
Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

361
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,998
<i>Just when you thought things</i>

362
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:43,835
<i>couldn't get more exciting going
into a very special Quarter Quell,</i>

363
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:47,047
our two lethal lovers,
my favorite expression,

364
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,758
from District 12

365
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,261
have surprised us
with a new twist in their love affair.

366
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,804
Let's take a look.

367
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:03,521
A fairy tale ending
for two star-crossed lovers.

368
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,565
<i>That's beautiful. Beautiful.</i>

369
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,609
<i>And then tonight,</i>

370
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:13,698
<i>the tour that began in the hollows
of District 12 will end where?</i>

371
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,700
The Presidential Palace.

372
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,911
The party of the year.

373
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:21,915
Eyes bright. Chins up. Smiles on.

374
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,459
I'm talking to you, Katniss.

375
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:28,380
Now, there'll be photographers.
Interviews.

376
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,550
Everyone will be here
to celebrate you.

377
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:33,843
My Victors.

378
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,225
Breathe it all in, children.

379
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,812
This is all for you.

380
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,021
It's cozy.

381
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,815
Attitude.

382
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,486
Come, come.

383
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:53,988
Come along.

384
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,325
Excuse us, excuse us.

385
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,000
Come, come.

386
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,132
Hold hands.

387
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,346
And the library. All mahogany.

388
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:19,806
Hello, hello!

389
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,724
Not yet, not yet. No, no, no.

390
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,143
Curtains!

391
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,812
Everybody who's anybody is here.

392
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,814
And they all want to meet you.

393
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,734
Flavius! Octavia!

394
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,743
Try one of these. They are divine.

395
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,370
No, I can't eat another thing.

396
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,205
- Here.
- What's this?

397
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:45,957
It's for when you're full.

398
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,877
It makes you sick.

399
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,670
So you can go on eating.

400
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,755
How else could you taste everything?

401
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,342
I think it's time for a dance.

402
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:58,678
Katniss?

403
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,566
People are starving in 12.

404
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,903
Here, they're just throwing it up
to stuff more in.

405
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,154
Katniss? Peeta.

406
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:21,075
This is Plutarch Heavensbee.
Head Gamemaker.

407
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,286
Successor to Seneca Crane.

408
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,996
That's a tough act to follow.

409
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,373
Peeta!

410
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:30,752
May I?

411
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,086
Please.

412
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,014
So how do you like the party?

413
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,724
It's a little overwhelming.

414
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,352
It's appalling-

415
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,773
Still, if you abandon your
moral judgment, it can be fun.

416
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,568
So are you having fun?

417
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,530
I'm the Head Gamemaker. Fun is my job.

418
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,032
Thought that was what happened
to Seneca Crane.

419
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,450
Too much fun.

420
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:07,413
Seneca decided to quit breathing.

421
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,040
Decided.

422
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,334
It was that or poison berries.

423
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:15,630
Being Head Gamemaker has never been
the most secure job in the world.

424
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,715
Then why are you here?

425
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,261
Same reason as you. I volunteered.

426
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,805
Why?

427
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,807
Ambition.

428
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,228
The chance to
make The Games mean something.

429
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,314
The Games don't mean anything.

430
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,817
They only mean to scare us.

431
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,945
Well, maybe it was you
who inspired me to come back.

432
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,827
The Presidential welcome.

433
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,162
I'm sure we'll meet again.

434
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,791
Katniss, come. The President awaits.

435
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,920
You think we convinced him?

436
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,797
I'm not sure what else we can do.

437
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:17,317
Tonight, on this, the
last day of their tour,

438
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,778
I want to welcome our two Victors.

439
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:25,658
Two young people who embody our ideals

440
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,369
of strength and valor.

441
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:34,959
And I, personally, want
to congratulate them

442
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,630
on the announcement
of their engagement.

443
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,636
Your love has inspired us.

444
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,557
And I know it will go on inspiring us

445
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,893
every day

446
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,896
for as long as you may live.

447
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,054
<i>Look at them.</i>

448
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,306
She's not who they think she is.

449
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,641
She's not a leader.

450
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,811
She just wants to save her own skin.
It's as simple as that.

451
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,479
I think that's true.

452
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,482
But she's become
a beacon of hope for the rebellion.

453
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,985
And she has to be eliminated.

454
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,988
I agree she should die.
But in the right way.

455
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,240
At the right time.

456
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:32,285
It's moves and countermoves.
That's all we gotta look at.

457
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,663
Katniss Everdeen is a symbol.
Their Mockingjay.

458
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,248
They think she's one of them.

459
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,584
We need to show that she's one of us.

460
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,253
We don't need to destroy her.
Just the image.

461
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,713
Then we let the people do the rest.

462
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,256
What do you propose?

463
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:48,301
Shut down the black markets.
Take away what little they have.

464
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,762
Then double the amount of
floggings and executions.

465
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,348
Put them on TV. Broadcast them live.

466
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,643
Sow fear. More fear.

467
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,855
It won't work. Fear does not work
as long as they have hope.

468
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,608
And Katniss Everdeen
is giving them hope.

469
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,901
She's engaged.

470
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,652
Make everything about that.

471
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,238
What kind of dress is she gonna wear?
Floggings.

472
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,616
What's the cake gonna look like?
Executions.

473
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,618
Who's gonna be there? Fear.

474
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:16,287
Blanket coverage.
Shove it in their faces.

475
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,664
Show them that she is one of us now.

476
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,668
They're gonna hate her so much
they might just kill her for you.

477
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,297
Brilliant.

478
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,393
When did you...

479
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,318
We need to talk.

480
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,783
Where are we gonna run away?

481
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,827
Into the woods.
Like we always talked about.

482
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,788
If we leave right now, we can be
far away from here by tonight.

483
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,122
Yeah, who's "we"?

484
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,666
You, me and your fiancé?

485
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,252
It's not just me and Peeta any more.

486
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:07,505
Snow threatened to have you killed.

487
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,550
Anyone else?

488
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,635
Well, he didn't exactly
give me a copy of the list

489
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,929
but a good guess,
it includes both of our families.

490
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,639
Unless what?
You and Peeta get married?

491
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,266
Unless nothing now.

492
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,851
Gale, we can do it.

493
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,062
You said yourself that we could do it
the morning of the Reaping.

494
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,606
What do you say now?

495
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:26,899
Do you love me?

496
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,152
Gale, you know how I feel about you.

497
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,822
But I can't think about anyone
that way right now.

498
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,783
The only thing that I can think about
every day, every waking moment

499
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,827
since the Reaping, is how afraid I am.

500
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,579
There's no room for anything else.

501
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,081
But maybe, if we got away from here,

502
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,667
if we went somewhere safe,
it could be different.

503
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,918
I could be different.

504
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,336
You think maybe the
President's bluffing?

505
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,462
He's not bluffing.

506
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,049
Not with what's going
on in the districts.

507
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,175
What do you mean?

508
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,220
What did you see?

509
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:00,224
There were people fighting
in the streets, and fires,

510
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:03,477
and Peacekeepers were gunning
them down, but the people were...

511
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,187
What? The people were what?

512
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,564
They were fighting back.

513
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,275
It's happening-

514
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,402
It's finally happening.

515
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:15,740
I should've just eaten the berries in the
arena and died like I was supposed to.

516
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,159
Then everything would be back to normal
and everyone would be safe.

517
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,785
Safe for what?

518
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,748
To starve? Work like slaves?
Send their kids to the Reaping?

519
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,751
You haven't hurt people, Katniss.
You've given them an opportunity.

520
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,170
They just have to be
brave enough to take it.

521
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,298
There's already talk in the mines.
People wanna fight.

522
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,550
We have to go, Gale,
before they kill us.

523
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,010
They Will kill us.

524
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,304
What about the other families?

525
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,140
The ones who stay.
What happens to them?

526
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:45,269
- People are looking to you, Katniss.
- I don't want anyone looking to me.

527
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,479
I can't help them.

528
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,866
You do what you want.

529
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,826
I'm staying here.

530
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:23,641
Commander Thread,
welcome to District 12.

531
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,108
Let's get to work.

532
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,508
- Let's go! Keep moving!
- Stay close!

533
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,176
<i>Find and clear.</i>

534
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,928
<i>Burn all contraband.</i>

535
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,522
Let me go!

536
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:38,799
Ripper!

537
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:39,967
My eye!

538
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,135
I'm gonna get you out of here.

539
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:42,303
No!

540
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:44,597
Leave her be! Stop!

541
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,184
No!

542
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,610
In the square.

543
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,160
Here.

544
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,583
Yeah, hold that on there.

545
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,020
No!

546
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:35,815
No! No! Stop!

547
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,488
Katniss!

548
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:44,949
It's okay.

549
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,535
Just go. It's okay.

550
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:54,834
Move.

551
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,003
You want another?

552
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,338
Go ahead.

553
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,634
- Get out of my way!
- No, you don't want to shoot her.

554
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,052
How about I shoot both of you?

555
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,221
Look, Commander, you're new here.

556
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,890
Trust me, I'm trying to help you.

557
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,183
I'm Haymitch.

558
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:14,562
You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen.

559
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,605
Darling of The Capitol.

560
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,818
She interfered with a Peacekeeper.

561
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,403
I never said she was smart.

562
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,490
Look, you already got
a couple of lashes in, right?

563
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,576
That's not good enough.
She's an agitator.

564
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,745
- Easy, easy.
- Look...

565
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,581
You're sure Snow
wants three dead Victors here?

566
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,082
Because that's what we're looking at.

567
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:39,086
It's bad enough that you marked up her
face on the eve of the big wedding.

568
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:42,089
Let it go. And we will, too.

569
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,100
All right.

570
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,771
Okay.

571
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:03,027
But next time, it's the firing squad.

572
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,446
Excellent idea.

573
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:07,406
I don't care who she is.

574
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,619
Clear the square!

575
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,414
You're all under curfew.

576
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:22,004
Anyone out after dark
will be shot on sight.

577
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,426
Get 'em outta here.

578
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,141
It's Gale.

579
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:35,643
Get him here.

580
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:39,563
Here we go.

581
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,107
Really easy. Up, UP-

582
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,318
Okay.

583
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,403
Okay. Thanks.

584
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,072
New Head Peacekeeper.

585
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,615
Not entirely peaceful.

586
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,492
Missed your eye.
Doesn't need stitches.

587
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:55,037
- Make a snow coat.
- Peeta, get the snow. I'll grind the herbs.

588
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:58,874
What is that? That's hurting him.

589
00:40:58,958 --> 00:40:59,959
He needs morphling.

590
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,505
It's okay.

591
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,143
Mom. No. I'll do it.

592
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,521
Oh, God.

593
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:24,942
Hold him, please.

594
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:31,865
That's better.

595
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,651
- Hey, Catnip.
- Hey.

596
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:10,237
Thought you'd be gone by now.

597
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,239
I'm not going anywhere.

598
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,410
I'm gonna stay right here.
Cause all kinds of trouble.

599
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,581
Me, too.

600
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,106
Hey.

601
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,529
You wanna get some rest?
I can look after him for a while.

602
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,786
I'm gonna go get him more snow.

603
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:28,816
Hey.

604
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,651
How's your eye?

605
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:33,570
It's not my eye that's bothering me.

606
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:38,158
How can we live like this?
How can anybody live like this?

607
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,661
It's not living, but...

608
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:45,958
Since the last Games,
something is different.

609
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:47,501
I can see it.

610
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:50,754
What can you see?

611
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:53,632
Hope.

612
00:43:56,635 --> 00:44:00,180
You understand that whatever I do
comes back to you and Mom.

613
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,433
I don't want you to get hurt.

614
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:06,437
You don't have to protect me. Or Mom.

615
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:09,940
We're with you.

616
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,325
I love you.

617
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,327
I love you, too.

618
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,664
The broadcast cut out here.

619
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,834
Before any of the
excitement happened.

620
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,296
- How many people saw it?
- Hard to say.

621
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:35,466
There was a five second delay,
but it happened fast.

622
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:41,722
If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen,
then I will have to terminate her.

623
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:43,182
I understand that.

624
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:44,641
And not just her.

625
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:51,482
Her entire species has
to be eliminated.

626
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:52,608
Her species, sir?

627
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,902
The other Victors.

628
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,405
Now, because of her,
they all pose a threat.

629
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:03,368
Because of her,
they all think they're invincible.

630
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:10,334
Whatever game you think you're playing,
those out there are not playing it with you.

631
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,129
There's a way we can still win.

632
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,843
It's what we Gamemakers
like to call "a wrinkle."

633
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,436
Ladies and gentlemen,

634
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:34,358
this is the 75th year
of The Hunger Games.

635
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,612
<i>And it was written
in the charter of The Games</i>

636
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,741
<i>that every 25 years,
there would be a Quarter Quell</i>

637
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:47,037
<i>to keep fresh for each new generation</i>

638
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:53,085
<i>the memory of those who died
in the uprising against The Capitol.</i>

639
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:59,299
<i>Each Quarter Quell is distinguished
by Games of a special significance.</i>

640
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,718
<i>And now on this the</i>

641
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:05,597
75th anniversary of
our defeat of the rebellion,

642
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:09,309
we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell

643
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:16,316
as a reminder that even the strongest

644
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:21,238
<i>cannot overcome the power of The Capitol.</i>

645
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:26,076
<i>On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games,</i>

646
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,330
<i>the male and female Tributes</i>

647
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:37,004
<i>are to be reaped from the existing pool
of Victors in each district.</i>

648
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:39,423
No!

649
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,550
Who does he mean?

650
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,094
<i>Victors shall present themselves
on Reaping Day</i>

651
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:47,514
-regardless of age...
- Katniss...

652
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:49,391
<i>...state of health</i>

653
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,767
<i>or situation</i>

654
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,822
No.

655
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:20,547
Peeta.

656
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,682
There she is.

657
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,476
Finally did the math?

658
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,895
And you've come to, what?

659
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,481
Ask me to... Die?

660
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,108
I'm here to drink.

661
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:43,028
Finally, something I
can help you with.

662
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:50,952
What's it say that Peeta was here
45 minutes ago begging to save your life

663
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,371
and you only just now show up?

664
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:53,830
It means we have to save him.

665
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:57,751
You could live 100 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy.

666
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:01,505
Come on, Haymitch.
Nobody decent ever wins The Games.

667
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:03,924
Nobody ever wins The Games. Period.

668
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,053
There are survivors.

669
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,514
There's no winners.

670
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,557
Peeta has to survive.

671
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,853
We have to do whatever
it takes to save him.

672
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:20,690
All right, if...

673
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:26,113
If they call his name,
I'll volunteer in his place.

674
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,906
Haymitch, thank you.

675
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:32,869
But they call my name and Peeta
volunteers, there's nothing I can do.

676
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,958
You can help him in the arena.
Like you did for me.

677
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,628
I think these Games are
gonna be different.

678
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,132
I don't care. Do whatever you can.

679
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,051
Peeta lives. Not me.

680
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:51,138
Promise me.

681
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,767
Okay.

682
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:03,900
We should've gone when you said.

683
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,496
<i>Welcome.</i>

684
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:58,830
Welcome.

685
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:03,543
As we celebrate the 75th anniversary

686
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:06,505
and 3rd Quarter Quell

687
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:09,716
of The Hunger Games.

688
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:13,720
As always, ladies first.

689
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:33,573
The female Tribute from District 12,

690
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,910
Katniss Everdeen.

691
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,048
Wonderful.

692
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,093
And now for the men.

693
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:07,440
The male Tribute from District 12.

694
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:10,986
Haymitch Abernathy.

695
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,321
- I volunteer as Tribute.
- I can't let you do that.

696
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:14,614
You can't stop me.

697
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:16,241
- Peeta.
- Let go.

698
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:22,956
Very well.

699
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,793
The Tributes from District 12.

700
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,379
Katniss Everdeen

701
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,257
and Peeta Mellark.

702
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:39,222
Well, all that remains is...

703
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,405
Oh, no. But, but, but...

704
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:57,449
Katniss!

705
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,326
- I get to say goodbye.
- Katniss!

706
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:02,329
- New plan. Straight to the train.
- No, I have to say goodbye.

707
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:03,413
Katniss!

708
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,623
No.

709
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,459
Good bye!

710
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,974
All right.

711
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,895
Before we begin, I've had a thought.

712
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,146
You don't say?

713
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:32,525
Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin.

714
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,694
I have my hair.

715
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:39,366
I'm going to get you two boys
something gold.

716
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,787
Why is that?

717
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,288
A token.

718
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,499
Show them we are a team.

719
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,668
And they can't just...

720
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:51,878
Thank you.

721
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:02,138
All right. Now...

722
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:07,852
Everything will be different,
because it's a Quarter Quell.

723
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:11,189
<i>The Capitol has spared no expense.</i>

724
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:12,732
<i>A new training center.</i>

725
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,234
<i>New Tribute living quarters.</i>

726
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:17,404
<i>And of course, a very special arena.</i>

727
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:20,573
<i>But this year you'll be facing other Victors.
Capitol favorites.</i>

728
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,367
<i>Smart, cunning, skilled.</i>

729
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:24,911
<i>And they all know one another.</i>

730
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:27,122
<i>You two are the outsiders.</i>

731
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:30,750
I want you guys to forget everything
you think you know about The Games.

732
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:33,044
Last year was child's play.

733
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:37,132
This year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.

734
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:39,676
All right. What does
that mean for us?

735
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:42,345
That means you're gonna have
to have some allies.

736
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:46,349
- Okay. I think that if...
- You're not the problem.

737
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:47,892
No.

738
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:51,271
Look, you're starting
at a disadvantage.

739
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:53,648
Most of these people
have been friends for years.

740
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:55,525
That just puts us higher
on their kill list.

741
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,737
Do it your own way,
but I know these people.

742
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:03,116
You go it alone, their first move
is gonna be to hunt you down.

743
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:04,868
Both of you.

744
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,786
Katniss, come on.

745
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,377
How could any of us
even trust each other?

746
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:18,089
It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.

747
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:22,552
Cashmere and Gloss.
Brother and sister. District 1.

748
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:25,305
They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.

749
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:28,266
Lots of sponsors.
They will be lethal.

750
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:32,479
And the other half of the Career Pack,
Brutus and Enobaria.

751
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:33,563
What's with her teeth?

752
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:37,066
She had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people's throats out.

753
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,401
She's committed. I'll give her that.

754
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:41,821
Wiress and Beetee.
Not fighters, but brilliant.

755
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,491
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

756
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:47,786
He won his Games by
electrocuting six Tributes at once.

757
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:50,413
The Morphlings.
Masters of camouflage.

758
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:53,833
Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.

759
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,503
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

760
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:57,670
Not a threat.

761
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:00,340
Finnick Odair, right?

762
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:03,301
Yes. He won his Games at 14.
Youngest ever.

763
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,470
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

764
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:09,307
Yes, I'm kidding.
He's a peacock. A total preener.

765
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:12,435
But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.

766
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:17,232
Charming, smart, and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.

767
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:19,943
- What about weaknesses?
- One. Mags.

768
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,820
She volunteered for Annie.

769
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:25,031
Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.

770
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:28,660
If he's trying to protect her
in any way, it exposes him.

771
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,495
A guy like that
has to know she's not gonna make it.

772
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,831
I bet when it really comes down to it,
he won't protect her.

773
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,959
Well, Katniss, I just hope when she goes,
she goes quickly.

774
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,920
She's actually a wonderful lady.

775
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,364
How'd we get here?

776
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,324
Katniss.

777
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,243
Hello, Finnick.

778
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:12,245
Do you want a sugar cube?

779
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,082
I mean, it's supposed to be
for the horses, but...

780
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,001
I mean, who cares about them, right?

781
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:20,336
They got years to eat sugar,
whereas you and I...

782
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,338
Well, if we see something sweet,
we better grab it.

783
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:26,801
No thanks. But I would love to
borrow that outfit someday.

784
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,429
You look pretty
terrifying in that getup.

785
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:31,347
What happened to
the pretty little girl dresses?

786
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:32,390
I outgrew them.

787
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,474
You certainly did.

788
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,769
Shame about this Quell thing.

789
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:40,523
Now, you could've made out
like a bandit in The Capitol.

790
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:42,901
Jewels, money, anything you wanted.

791
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:45,904
Well, I don't like jewels
and I have more money than I need, so...

792
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,822
What did you do with all your wealth,
anyway?

793
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,575
I haven't dealt in anything
as common as money in years.

794
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:53,620
Then how do people pay for
the pleasure of your company?

795
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:57,790
With secrets.

796
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:02,545
What about you, Girl on Fire?

797
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:05,048
Any secrets worth my time?

798
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:07,634
I'm an open book.

799
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:10,929
Everybody always seems to know
my secrets before I know them myself.

800
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:12,972
Unfortunately, I think that's true.

801
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:18,144
I'm sorry you had to
cancel your wedding.

802
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:22,148
I know how devastating
that must be for you.

803
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:26,527
Have a good day.

804
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,823
- Peeta.
- Finnick.

805
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,743
What'd he want?

806
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,328
To know all my secrets.

807
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,622
He'll have to get in line.

808
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:40,208
<i>Tributes, mount up.</i>

809
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,168
No waving and smiling, this time.

810
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,503
I want you to look straight ahead

811
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,422
as if the audience and this
whole event are beneath you.

812
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,591
That should be easy.

813
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,302
Press this when you're ready.

814
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:52,845
Good luck.

815
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,745
Here they come!

816
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,622
From District 12. Our favorites.

817
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:21,749
- Well...
- Or my favorite.

818
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:03,291
There it is!

819
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:05,918
Fire in the house!

820
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:11,758
Katniss! Katniss! Katniss!

821
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,200
Nice. Way to make friends
out there, you two.

822
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:38,785
Well, we learned from the best.

823
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:41,454
I wanna introduce you to
some special friends of mine.

824
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,957
This is Seeder. And Chaff.
From District 11.

825
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,545
He's very friendly.

826
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:53,466
Don't invite him over.
He'll drink up your liquor.

827
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,134
I'll see you guys soon.

828
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:58,888
Let's get some of that makeup off you
and talk about these other Tributes.

829
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,057
These Tributes are crazy.

830
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,476
No, not all of 'em. He's a good guy.

831
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:05,812
Carry on.

832
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,237
You guys look amazing.

833
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,321
Thank you.

834
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,490
My stylist is such an idiot.

835
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:21,160
District 7. Lumber. Trees.

836
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:24,914
I'd love to put my ax in her face.

837
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:27,333
So what do you think?

838
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,752
Now that the whole world
wants to sleep with you?

839
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,463
- I don't think that the whole world...
- I wasn't talking to you.

840
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,589
Okay.

841
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:34,841
Will you unzip?

842
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:36,676
Yeah.

843
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,079
Thanks. Let's do it again sometime.

844
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:06,873
Thank you.

845
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,835
Johanna Mason, District 7.

846
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:17,383
Remember, Katniss,
today's about making allies.

847
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,599
So far I'm not overwhelmed
by our choices.

848
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,895
I guess we just try to figure out
who we trust least

849
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,063
and work our way backwards from there.

850
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:17,401
Friction generates heat.
Heat generates fire. In theory.

851
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,612
You should move your hands downward.

852
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:23,032
And faster, too.

853
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,629
- A little brute force...
-...is always helpful.

854
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,590
Thank you.

855
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:41,634
By the corner of the table.

856
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,803
Plutarch?

857
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,806
No. Next to him.

858
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,141
Force field.

859
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:50,393
How do you know?

860
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:51,811
The shimmering.

861
01:02:54,522 --> 01:02:56,023
Top left hand side.

862
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:57,900
Look.

863
01:02:58,859 --> 01:02:59,860
There.

864
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,071
You see it?

865
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,157
Looks like glass.

866
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:07,159
To separate us and them.

867
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:10,746
Probably my fault.
I shot an arrow at them last year.

868
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,331
Electromagnetic.

869
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:13,416
How can you tell?

870
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,211
Is it obvious or something?

871
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,673
"Is it obvious?"

872
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:24,635
- They might as well have a sign.
- Look around you.

873
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:28,514
All the holograms, the lights,
every now and then they flicker. Why?

874
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:31,350
Because the force field
is taking up too much energy.

875
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,603
There's always a flaw in the system.

876
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:47,616
That's beautiful.

877
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,745
I saw you volunteer
for that young girl.

878
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:53,664
It was really brave.

879
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:03,382
Prim is my sister.

880
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,887
If you

881
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:11,307
If you teach me how to make a fishhook
like that, I could teach you how to hunt.

882
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,269
Yes, yes.

883
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:20,358
<i>Do you wanna try with me?</i>

884
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:22,276
Okay.

885
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:24,028
I'll go first.

886
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,301
<i>Good news.</i>

887
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:33,681
At least half the Tributes
want you as an ally.

888
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,474
Well, they saw her shoot.

889
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:38,185
Well, sweetheart,
you got your pick of the litter.

890
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:39,728
I want Wiress and Beetee.

891
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,897
Johanna calls them "Nuts" and "Volts."

892
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:44,942
- Well, okay, good. Now, who else?
- Mags.

893
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:48,320
All right, fine, then no one.

894
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,825
I'll tell them
you're still making up your mind.

895
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:11,844
<i>District 3. Beetee Latter.</i>

896
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:14,847
<i>Report for individual assessment.</i>

897
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:29,236
Peeta, how are we gonna
kill these people?

898
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:38,537
<i>District 12. Katniss Everdeen.</i>

899
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,248
<i>Report for individual assessment.</i>

900
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,743
Miss Everdeen.

901
01:07:21,205 --> 01:07:22,289
Miss Everdeen!

902
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,795
You have 10 minutes
to present your chosen skill.

903
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:27,187
Thank you! Thank you!

904
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,648
Thank you for being here tonight

905
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:35,195
on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games!

906
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:45,205
We have never seen anything like this.
And we will never see anything like it again.

907
01:08:46,457 --> 01:08:49,001
Because tonight, on this stage,

908
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:53,005
24 of Panem's brightest stars

909
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:56,634
will vie for the ultimate crown.

910
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,013
Tonight will be their final opportunity
to express their thoughts.

911
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,309
Our final opportunity
to express our love.

912
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,394
And heartbreakingly,

913
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:14,068
to say goodbye to all but one.

914
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,405
What a night.

915
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:21,992
Let's hear it.

916
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,371
It's so exciting!

917
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:29,166
A wedding dress?

918
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:33,212
President Snow insisted,
but I made a few alterations.

919
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:36,757
<i>You two made The Games
a family affair.</i>

920
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,885
You became everyone's
brother and sister.

921
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:42,888
I don't know how we're
going to let you go.

922
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,557
We're not going by choice.

923
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:48,602
You are our family.

924
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:51,313
And I don't see how anyone
can love us better.

925
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:54,858
So sweet. So sweet.

926
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:56,443
Are you all right, dear?

927
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:57,945
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

928
01:09:58,028 --> 01:09:59,613
<i>I just can't stop crying.</i>

929
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:02,116
God! Does anybody
actually believe this?

930
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,535
Apparently, everybody.

931
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,248
She is very good.

932
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:11,333
These Victors are angry, Katniss.

933
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:14,044
They'll say anything
to try and stop The Games.

934
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,422
I suggest you do the same.

935
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,465
Beetee...

936
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:22,678
You have contributed so much
to Panem over the years.

937
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:25,681
I don't know who we will miss more.

938
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:27,433
You or your brain.

939
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:34,231
If the Quarter Quell were written into law
by men, certainly, it can be unwritten.

940
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:37,818
Yes. Interesting concept.

941
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,112
Finnick...

942
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:45,409
I understand that you have a message
for somebody out there.

943
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:47,619
A special somebody.

944
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:50,998
Can we hear it?

945
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:53,500
My love,

946
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:56,044
you have my heart

947
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:58,130
for all eternity

948
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:03,719
and if I die in that arena,

949
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,723
my last thought will be of your lips.

950
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,685
We have seen a lot of
tears here tonight.

951
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,396
But I see no tears in Johanna's eyes.

952
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,023
Johanna, you are angry.

953
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,316
Tell me why.

954
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,651
Well, yes, I'm angry.

955
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:22,196
You know, I'm getting
totally screwed over here.

956
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:26,909
The deal was that if I win the Hunger Games,
I get to live the rest of my life in peace.

957
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:29,453
But now you want to kill me again.

958
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:33,415
Well, you know what? ...that!

959
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:36,835
And...everybody that had anything
to do with it!

960
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:38,212
All right then.

961
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,714
One woman's opinion.

962
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,216
Who's next?

963
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:43,592
All right, turn around.

964
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:46,929
<i>I know it's a bad break
for everyone involved.</i>

965
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:49,348
I think I'm done.

966
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:51,350
Will I be twirling tonight?

967
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:52,684
Save it for the end.

968
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:55,646
One minute. Is she ready?

969
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,443
Katniss.

970
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:08,325
You would have been
the most beautiful bride.

971
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,410
Thank you.

972
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:15,874
Let's go show them
what real beauty looks like.

973
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,876
It has to go more up.

974
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:20,504
Pretty, pretty, Katniss,
they're going to adore you.

975
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:23,298
And there are a lot of sponsors
in the audience,

976
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:26,218
so of course, just be your usual self.

977
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,136
Actually, be your happier self.

978
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,639
Really? A wedding dress?

979
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,391
Snow made me wear it.

980
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:37,396
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...</i>

981
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,356
<i>- You know her...
- Make him pay for it.</i>

982
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:40,566
<i>...as the Girl on Fire.</i>

983
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:43,318
<i>The Victor of last
year's Hunger Games.</i>

984
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,737
<i>Katniss Everdeen!</i>

985
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:04,423
Katniss Everdeen, you look fabulous.
Doesn't she?

986
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,971
My, my!

987
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:14,099
Now, Katniss,

988
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:16,602
this is

989
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:22,691
a very big and very emotional night

990
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:24,484
for all of us.

991
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:25,944
Wouldn't you say?

992
01:13:26,028 --> 01:13:28,238
Don't go crying on me now, Caesar.

993
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:30,032
I can't make any promises.
You know me.

994
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,576
You know I wouldn't believe you,
even if you did.

995
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:35,370
I love her!
The Girl on Fire is so cheeky.

996
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:40,834
But, Katniss, on a more serious note.

997
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:47,090
I think we're all here a little disappointed,
more than a little disappointed,

998
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:50,469
that a certain wedding
did not take place.

999
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:53,805
Aren't we, folks?

1000
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,894
Alas. But am I correct in assuming

1001
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:04,566
that this is the gown that you would
have worn on that day, yes or no?

1002
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:08,987
Yes, President Snow thought
everyone would want to see it.

1003
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:12,324
Well, President Snow,
as usual, was right.

1004
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,284
Was he not, folks?

1005
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:16,244
I love it! I love it!

1006
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:17,329
Don't you love it, folks?

1007
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,081
It's incredible. It's so gorgeous.

1008
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:22,250
Will you do us the honor?
Please? Please? Please?

1009
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,515
Oh, my God!

1010
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:40,519
Oh, my!

1011
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,611
It's a bird.

1012
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:53,949
It's got feathers. It's like a bird.

1013
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,367
It's like a...

1014
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,618
Like a Mockingjay.

1015
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:01,623
Your stylist certainly has
outdone himself this time, hasn't he?

1016
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:02,958
<i>What theatricality!</i>

1017
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,209
<i>Cinna!</i>

1018
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:06,211
<i>Take a bow.</i>

1019
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:15,637
But, Peeta,

1020
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:20,809
the wedding, the
marriage, never to be?

1021
01:15:22,144 --> 01:15:24,146
Well, actually, we got married.

1022
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:25,313
In secret.

1023
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,108
A secret wedding?

1024
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:29,609
All right. Do tell.

1025
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:33,321
- We want our love to be eternal.
- Of course.

1026
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:36,742
You know, Katniss and I,
we've been luckier than most.

1027
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:39,161
And I wouldn't have
any regrets at all

1028
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,081
if it weren't...

1029
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,293
If...

1030
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,797
If it weren't for what? What?

1031
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:54,426
If it weren't for the baby.

1032
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,637
All right. This is news!

1033
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:58,889
Let's find out more.

1034
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:03,769
Calm down. This is news to all of us.

1035
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:04,853
Call off The Games!

1036
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:06,772
All right.

1037
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,860
- Let's...
- Stop The Games!

1038
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,403
Everybody, calm down.

1039
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:16,573
It's a great night. A great night.

1040
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:23,455
This is news to all of us.

1041
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,459
All right, all right, all right.

1042
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,670
We're going to find out
what we do about this.

1043
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,468
Cancel The Games!

1044
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:39,054
Stop The Games!

1045
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,692
There's no way they'll cancel.
They can't.

1046
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:59,074
Baby bomb was a stroke of genius.

1047
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:02,077
Unfortunately, Games are still on.

1048
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:04,329
This is goodbye, for now.

1049
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,708
Presents for the boys.

1050
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:10,669
What is this?

1051
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,506
Your token. Remember?

1052
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,716
Hair for me. Pin for Katniss.

1053
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,301
Gold bangle for you.

1054
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,222
And for Peeta,
the medallion that we talked about.

1055
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:25,308
Thank you, Effie.

1056
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,688
We're a team. Aren't we?

1057
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:35,527
And I'm so proud of my Victors.

1058
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:38,738
So proud.

1059
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,367
You're so...

1060
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:50,876
Well, you both deserved so much better.

1061
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:53,712
Thank you, Effie.

1062
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:56,715
I am truly sorry.

1063
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,723
Thank you, Haymitch.

1064
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:07,184
For everything.

1065
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:10,937
Any last advice?

1066
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:14,733
Stay alive.

1067
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:18,403
Haymitch, wait.

1068
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:22,157
Remember our deal.

1069
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:26,912
Do whatever it takes
to keep him alive.

1070
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,331
Promise me.

1071
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:30,790
Okay.

1072
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:37,923
Katniss, when you're in the arena,
remember who the real enemy is.

1073
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:50,894
I don't want to be with
anyone else in there.

1074
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:52,854
Just you.

1075
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:01,238
If that's what you want.

1076
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,074
That's what I want.

1077
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,706
I'll see you soon.

1078
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:38,066
Your tracker.

1079
01:20:06,428 --> 01:20:09,597
Look at this. They're holding hands.

1080
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,017
I want them dead.

1081
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:14,769
Be patient.

1082
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:19,691
They're holding hands now, but the minute
the gun goes off, it'll be a bloodbath.

1083
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:24,571
And the whole idea of revolution
will be discredited.

1084
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,364
And the idea of her?

1085
01:20:26,865 --> 01:20:29,075
The idea of the Mockingjay?

1086
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:34,247
The more allies she betrays,
the more friends she kills,

1087
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:36,624
the more she reveals her true self.

1088
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:41,212
As long as it ends with her picture
in the sky and the sound of cannon.

1089
01:20:41,296 --> 01:20:43,715
- And it shall.
- It better.

1090
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:47,218
Let's watch her get her
hands dirty first.

1091
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:50,638
Excuse me.

1092
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:03,610
Let's start.

1093
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,868
This suit is light. No thermal.

1094
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:14,079
So I'd guess tropics or desert.

1095
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,915
<i>Sixty seconds to launch.</i>

1096
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,960
That dress was beautiful.

1097
01:21:22,087 --> 01:21:24,381
I think it was the best
one you've ever made.

1098
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:26,883
I thought you'd like it.

1099
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:29,135
I just wanted to tell
you, because I don't...

1100
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:30,303
Stop.

1101
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:34,516
Remember, I'm still betting on you,
Girl on Fire.

1102
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,493
<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

1103
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:18,518
No!

1104
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,228
Cinna! No!

1105
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,525
No!No!No!

1106
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:27,527
No! Cinna!

1107
01:22:28,069 --> 01:22:30,405
No! No!

1108
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:31,656
No!

1109
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,491
No!

1110
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:38,830
No, no...

1111
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:03,188
<i>Let the 75th Hunger Games begin.</i>

1112
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,858
<i>May the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

1113
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,109
Peeta?

1114
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:15,575
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

1115
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,119
<i>seven, six,</i>

1116
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:20,997
<i>five, four,</i>

1117
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:24,042
<i>three, two,</i>

1118
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,543
One

1119
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:11,631
Good thing we're allies, right?

1120
01:24:12,507 --> 01:24:13,675
Where did you get that?

1121
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:14,842
Where do you think?

1122
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:17,095
Duck.

1123
01:24:20,765 --> 01:24:22,016
Don't trust 1 and 2.

1124
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:23,810
I'll take this side.
You hold them off.

1125
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,478
I'll go find Peeta.

1126
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:31,109
Katniss, Mags found him.
He's over here.

1127
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:27,081
Katniss, Katniss, go, go, go, go.

1128
01:25:46,351 --> 01:25:48,227
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

1129
01:25:49,896 --> 01:25:51,022
Here you go.

1130
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,232
Okay. You all right now?

1131
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,361
Okay?

1132
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:02,784
God, it's hot.

1133
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:05,244
We gotta find fresh water.

1134
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:19,467
Well, I guess we're not
holding hands any more.

1135
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:20,927
You think that's funny?

1136
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:24,472
Every time that cannon goes off,
it's music to my ears.

1137
01:26:25,056 --> 01:26:26,724
I don't care about any of them.

1138
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:28,601
Good to hear.

1139
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,854
Want to face the Career Pack alone?

1140
01:26:33,064 --> 01:26:34,315
What would Haymitch say?

1141
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:35,733
Haymitch isn't here.

1142
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:39,237
Let's keep moving.

1143
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:23,823
Peeta, no!

1144
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:31,414
Peeta?

1145
01:27:32,957 --> 01:27:34,041
Peeta?

1146
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:36,627
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

1147
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:38,379
He's not breathing! Peeta!

1148
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:45,595
Peeta?

1149
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,263
Peeta?

1150
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:49,724
Come on! Come on!

1151
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:50,892
Please, wake up.

1152
01:27:51,434 --> 01:27:52,435
No.

1153
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:56,606
Please, wake up.

1154
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,524
- Come on.
- Come on!

1155
01:27:59,317 --> 01:28:00,985
Bring me in closer.

1156
01:28:05,907 --> 01:28:06,991
Cannon ready?

1157
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:14,665
Come on. Come on. Come on, Peeta!

1158
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,669
Please, Peeta. Peeta.

1159
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,215
Come on.

1160
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:25,676
Peeta? Peeta.

1161
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:31,891
Oh, my God.

1162
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:34,018
Be careful.
There's a force field up there.

1163
01:28:37,605 --> 01:28:40,441
Oh, my God. You were dead.

1164
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:43,653
You were dead. Your heart stopped.

1165
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:45,071
It's okay.

1166
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,365
It's working now.

1167
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:53,120
- You... Do you wanna stand up?
- Yeah.

1168
01:29:03,506 --> 01:29:04,632
It's okay.

1169
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,059
Someday I want to love
someone that much.

1170
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:18,896
And so you shall, my darling.
So you shall.

1171
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:42,128
Hang on.

1172
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:40,811
<i>The force field...</i>

1173
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:43,147
It's a dome. We're at
the edge of the arena.

1174
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:45,608
We couldn't find any
signs of fresh water.

1175
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:48,778
It's gonna get dark soon.

1176
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,488
We'll be safe with
our backs protected.

1177
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:54,325
We should set up camp.
Take turns sleeping. I can take first watch.

1178
01:30:54,659 --> 01:30:55,743
Not a chance.

1179
01:30:57,912 --> 01:31:00,581
Honey, that thing I did
back there for Peeta?

1180
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:01,958
That was called "saving his life."

1181
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,502
If I wanted to kill either of you,
I would've done it by now.

1182
01:31:09,924 --> 01:31:12,093
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll take the first watch.

1183
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:16,180
Just for a little bit.

1184
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:34,865
How's Peeta?

1185
01:31:37,368 --> 01:31:40,121
He's okay, I think.

1186
01:31:40,204 --> 01:31:42,289
Just dehydrated like the rest of us.

1187
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:16,657
Eight.

1188
01:32:29,295 --> 01:32:30,296
Hey.

1189
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:39,889
Drink up"?

1190
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,265
What is it?

1191
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:42,641
It's from Haymitch.

1192
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:46,270
I think it's a spile.

1193
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:47,563
A What?

1194
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,915
You're kidding me. You're kidding me.

1195
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:07,583
Get some water.

1196
01:33:17,468 --> 01:33:18,803
I'm gonna get a leaf.

1197
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:25,643
I'll get some for Mags.

1198
01:33:25,935 --> 01:33:27,144
There we go.

1199
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:36,737
Want some more?

1200
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:09,687
I counted 12.

1201
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,481
Midnight?

1202
01:34:12,982 --> 01:34:14,525
Or the number of districts.

1203
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:32,168
Well...

1204
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:36,130
If you're not gonna sleep, I will.

1205
01:34:36,797 --> 01:34:37,798
Okay.

1206
01:35:57,962 --> 01:36:01,340
Run! Run! The fog is poison!

1207
01:36:02,216 --> 01:36:03,676
Come on, come on, come on

1208
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:07,012
There!

1209
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,037
God! God!

1210
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,042
Mags, please, please!
Come on! Come on!

1211
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:21,420
Peeta.

1212
01:37:28,385 --> 01:37:29,553
I can't carry him.

1213
01:37:30,429 --> 01:37:31,680
Peeta, please.

1214
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:34,808
Peeta, please, stand up.
We have to go.

1215
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:37,561
Mags?

1216
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:39,980
- Mags? Mags!
- Finnick.

1217
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:41,357
- Mags!
- Finnick.

1218
01:37:41,774 --> 01:37:42,816
Mags!

1219
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,444
Finnick! Finnick, we have to go.

1220
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,112
We have to get outta here.

1221
01:37:49,073 --> 01:37:50,491
We have to go.

1222
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:54,370
All right, come on, come on. Come on.

1223
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:55,662
Okay.

1224
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:10,260
Shit!

1225
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:48,984
The water! The water helps.

1226
01:40:37,324 --> 01:40:38,784
We need our weapons.

1227
01:41:06,937 --> 01:41:08,438
I'm sorry about Mags.

1228
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:17,447
She was never gonna make it.

1229
01:41:19,283 --> 01:41:20,367
So...

1230
01:41:39,136 --> 01:41:40,137
What?

1231
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:06,330
- Peeta.
- Yeah?

1232
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:09,041
Walk over here slowly.

1233
01:42:41,406 --> 01:42:42,699
Get to the beach.

1234
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:54,229
We gotta get to the beach!

1235
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:21,339
- Who is that?
- A Morphling! Help me get her!

1236
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:49,367
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

1237
01:44:53,205 --> 01:44:57,083
Hey, you wanna see something?
Look up. Look.

1238
01:44:58,543 --> 01:45:00,837
Look at it. Look at that.

1239
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:03,173
It's incredible, isn't it?

1240
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,217
All those colors.

1241
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:08,094
Don't worry about anything else.

1242
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:10,889
I'll be right here with you.

1243
01:45:11,264 --> 01:45:13,558
It's okay. It's okay.

1244
01:46:12,868 --> 01:46:16,037
She sacrificed herself for me
and I didn't even know her name.

1245
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:20,876
You think she sacrificed herself?

1246
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:24,254
Looked like it.

1247
01:46:26,923 --> 01:46:28,842
That doesn't make any sense.

1248
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,455
Look. For you.

1249
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:04,878
Thank you.

1250
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,511
That's new.

1251
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:08,024
Someone's here.

1252
01:48:17,033 --> 01:48:18,118
Johanna?

1253
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:21,913
- Johanna!
- Finnick!

1254
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:28,712
Guess we have more allies.

1255
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:39,931
Well...

1256
01:48:40,724 --> 01:48:42,100
I got 'em out.

1257
01:48:42,475 --> 01:48:46,438
We were all the way deep into the jungle
where I thought it was gonna be safe.

1258
01:48:47,564 --> 01:48:49,149
That's when the rain started.

1259
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,818
I thought it was water.

1260
01:48:52,152 --> 01:48:53,945
It turned out to be blood.

1261
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:57,198
- Tick took.
- Hot, thick blood.

1262
01:48:57,282 --> 01:48:58,658
- It was coming down.
- Tick took.

1263
01:48:58,742 --> 01:49:00,201
It was choking us.

1264
01:49:00,285 --> 01:49:02,996
We were stumbling around,
gagging on it, blind.

1265
01:49:03,246 --> 01:49:04,205
Tick took.

1266
01:49:04,289 --> 01:49:07,250
- That's when Blight hit the force field.
- Tick took.

1267
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:08,918
Tick took.

1268
01:49:09,002 --> 01:49:11,296
He wasn't much, but he was from home.

1269
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:12,672
Tick took.

1270
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,467
Tick took.

1271
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:17,844
- Tick took.
- What's wrong with her?

1272
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:19,554
- She's in shock.
- Tick took.

1273
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,599
Dehydration isn't helping.
Do you have fresh water?

1274
01:49:22,682 --> 01:49:23,850
- We can get some.
- Just...

1275
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:25,060
Tick took.

1276
01:49:25,143 --> 01:49:27,437
Listen. Stop it!

1277
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,105
- Hey! Lay off her!
- Just sit down!

1278
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,983
Hey! What are you doing?

1279
01:49:32,067 --> 01:49:34,486
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I got them out for you!

1280
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:36,029
It's okay. It's okay.

1281
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:37,238
Let me go, Finnick!

1282
01:49:37,322 --> 01:49:39,574
- For me? What does that mean?
- Let me go.

1283
01:49:39,657 --> 01:49:41,367
- You did want them as allies.
- I'm fine.

1284
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:48,458
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

1285
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,920
Tick took.

1286
01:49:52,003 --> 01:49:53,213
- Tick took.
- Tick took!

1287
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:54,672
Tick took, okay.

1288
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:08,895
What does Beetee have there?

1289
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:11,481
The coil? It's some kind of wire.

1290
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:15,360
Did he get it from the Cornucopia?

1291
01:50:16,528 --> 01:50:18,154
Took a knife in the back to get it.

1292
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:20,824
- Tick took! Tick took!
- All right.

1293
01:50:21,658 --> 01:50:22,826
I can't.

1294
01:50:23,076 --> 01:50:24,828
Just... Have fun with "Nuts."

1295
01:50:35,505 --> 01:50:36,548
Tick took.

1296
01:50:36,756 --> 01:50:38,007
Tick took.

1297
01:50:39,342 --> 01:50:40,677
It's a clock.

1298
01:50:42,345 --> 01:50:43,555
It's a clock.

1299
01:50:43,638 --> 01:50:46,224
My God, it's a clock!
Wiress, you're a genius.

1300
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:47,475
You're a genius!

1301
01:50:55,900 --> 01:51:00,446
<i>This entire arena seems to be laid out
like a clock with a new threat every hour,</i>

1302
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:02,615
<i>but they stay only within their wedge.</i>

1303
01:51:02,907 --> 01:51:04,367
<i>It all starts with the lightning.</i>

1304
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:06,452
Then the blood rain, fog, monkeys.

1305
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:07,996
That's the first four hours.

1306
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:10,248
At 10:00, that big wave
hits from over there.

1307
01:51:10,456 --> 01:51:12,208
Wiress, you're a genius.

1308
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:14,210
Look, the tail points to 12.

1309
01:51:14,752 --> 01:51:16,921
That's where the lightning strikes
at noon and midnight.

1310
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:19,382
- Strikes where?
- That big tree.

1311
01:51:22,886 --> 01:51:23,887
Good.

1312
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:28,099
"Hickory dickory dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

1313
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:30,894
"The clock struck one,
the mouse ran down.

1314
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,645
"Hickory dickory dock."

1315
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:38,401
So 12:00 to 1:00, lightning.

1316
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,278
Then 1:00 to 2:00 is blood.

1317
01:51:40,612 --> 01:51:42,739
Then fog. And then monkeys.

1318
01:51:43,072 --> 01:51:46,868
"Hickory dickory dock.
The dog barked at the clock.

1319
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:47,994
"The clock struck 3:00..."

1320
01:51:48,077 --> 01:51:49,537
And then 10:00 to 11:00, the wave.

1321
01:51:49,621 --> 01:51:51,414
What about everything else?
Did you guys see anything?

1322
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:52,540
"Hickory dickory dock."

1323
01:51:52,624 --> 01:51:54,459
- Nothing but blood.
- It doesn't matter.

1324
01:51:54,584 --> 01:51:57,212
As long as we steer clear of whichever
sector is active, we'll be safe.

1325
01:51:57,295 --> 01:51:58,922
Yeah. Relatively speaking.

1326
01:52:27,492 --> 01:52:28,826
Change it up. Spin it.

1327
01:52:37,293 --> 01:52:38,294
Come on! Come on!

1328
01:52:57,981 --> 01:52:58,982
Hold on!

1329
01:53:14,664 --> 01:53:17,000
No!

1330
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:20,920
Okay. That's enough.

1331
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,840
Let's see how they tell time now.

1332
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:48,531
You Okay?

1333
01:53:51,409 --> 01:53:54,370
Let's just get what we need
and get off the bloody island.

1334
01:54:03,379 --> 01:54:05,715
So besides Brutus and
Enobaria, who's left?

1335
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:06,799
Maybe Chaff.

1336
01:54:06,883 --> 01:54:08,676
- Just those three.
- They know they're outnumbered.

1337
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,178
I doubt they'll attack again.

1338
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:11,721
We're safe here on the beach.

1339
01:54:11,888 --> 01:54:13,097
So what do we do? We hunt 'em down?

1340
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:16,768
Katniss, help me!

1341
01:54:17,143 --> 01:54:18,144
Prim!

1342
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:19,979
- Prim! Prim!
- No!

1343
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:21,773
Katniss! Katniss, wait!

1344
01:54:21,981 --> 01:54:24,400
Prim! Prim!

1345
01:54:26,402 --> 01:54:27,487
Prim!

1346
01:54:27,904 --> 01:54:28,905
Prim!

1347
01:54:29,072 --> 01:54:30,239
Katniss!

1348
01:54:32,283 --> 01:54:34,869
Help me! Help me!

1349
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:39,832
Katniss!

1350
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,296
- You okay?
- Finnick!

1351
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,506
Finnick!

1352
01:54:46,589 --> 01:54:48,007
- No! It's not her.
- Annie!

1353
01:54:48,925 --> 01:54:49,926
Annie!

1354
01:54:50,093 --> 01:54:53,096
- Annie! Annie!
- Finnick! It's not her.

1355
01:54:53,262 --> 01:54:54,555
It's just a jabberjay. It's not her.

1356
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:55,932
Well, how do you think
they got that sound?

1357
01:54:56,015 --> 01:54:57,767
- Jabberjays copy.
- Katniss!

1358
01:54:58,518 --> 01:54:59,519
Gale.

1359
01:55:03,106 --> 01:55:04,774
Come on, come on, come on!

1360
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:23,543
Peeta!

1361
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:27,088
Stop, stop, stop! It's okay!

1362
01:55:29,632 --> 01:55:31,968
It's okay! They're just mutts!
It's not real!

1363
01:55:43,896 --> 01:55:45,648
It's over. It's okay. They're gone.

1364
01:55:45,815 --> 01:55:47,984
The hour's gone.
The hour's up. It's all right.

1365
01:55:48,985 --> 01:55:51,112
- Prim! Find Prim!
- No, no. Prim's okay.

1366
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,073
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1367
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:57,452
Okay? They won't touch Prim.
All right?

1368
01:55:59,662 --> 01:56:02,081
Your fiancé's right.
The whole country loves your sister.

1369
01:56:02,665 --> 01:56:04,834
If they tortured her or
did anything to her,

1370
01:56:04,917 --> 01:56:09,881
forget the districts, there would
be riots in the damn Capitol.

1371
01:56:13,676 --> 01:56:15,386
Hey, how does that sound, Snow?

1372
01:56:15,595 --> 01:56:19,223
What if we set your backyard on fire?

1373
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:23,853
You know, you can't put
everybody in here.

1374
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:30,234
What?

1375
01:56:31,777 --> 01:56:33,237
They can't hurt me.

1376
01:56:34,363 --> 01:56:35,823
There's no one left that I love.

1377
01:56:39,535 --> 01:56:41,078
I'll get you some water.

1378
01:57:07,897 --> 01:57:09,232
Thank you.

1379
01:57:21,077 --> 01:57:22,245
Who's Annie?

1380
01:57:26,749 --> 01:57:29,710
Annie Cresta.
The girl Mags volunteered for.

1381
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:35,132
She won, like, four years...
Five years ago.

1382
01:57:36,759 --> 01:57:38,844
Is she the one that went a little...

1383
01:57:49,021 --> 01:57:50,773
Love is weird.

1384
01:57:55,278 --> 01:57:56,445
I have a plan.

1385
01:58:00,783 --> 01:58:01,867
Finnick!

1386
01:58:02,618 --> 01:58:03,995
I have a plan.

1387
01:58:08,332 --> 01:58:10,626
Where do the Careers feel safest?
The jungle?

1388
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:12,295
The jungle's a nightmare.

1389
01:58:12,628 --> 01:58:14,380
Probably here on the beach.

1390
01:58:14,463 --> 01:58:15,631
Then why are they not here?

1391
01:58:15,715 --> 01:58:17,800
Because we are. We claimed it.

1392
01:58:17,883 --> 01:58:19,635
And if we left, they would come.

1393
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:21,721
Or stay hidden in the tree line.

1394
01:58:21,804 --> 01:58:25,933
Which in just over four hours will be
soaked with water from the 10:00 wave.

1395
01:58:26,309 --> 01:58:27,602
And what happens at midnight?

1396
01:58:27,685 --> 01:58:30,396
- Lightning strikes that tree.
- Here's what I propose.

1397
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:34,150
We leave the beach at dusk.
We head to the lightning tree.

1398
01:58:34,233 --> 01:58:35,985
That should draw them
back to the beach.

1399
01:58:36,235 --> 01:58:40,031
Prior to midnight, we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.

1400
01:58:40,823 --> 01:58:44,702
Anyone in the water or on the damp sand
will be electrocuted.

1401
01:58:46,829 --> 01:58:49,040
How do we know
the wire's not gonna burn up?

1402
01:58:49,248 --> 01:58:50,875
Because I invented it.

1403
01:58:51,167 --> 01:58:53,210
I assure you, it won't burn up.

1404
01:59:04,096 --> 01:59:06,599
Well, it's better than
hunting them down.

1405
01:59:06,766 --> 01:59:07,767
Yeah, why not?

1406
01:59:08,517 --> 01:59:10,561
If it fails, no harm
done anyway, right?

1407
01:59:11,562 --> 01:59:13,230
All right, I say we try it.

1408
01:59:13,898 --> 01:59:15,566
<i>So what can we do to help?</i>

1409
01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:19,612
<i>Keep me alive for the next six hours.</i>

1410
01:59:19,695 --> 01:59:21,572
<i>That would be extremely helpful.</i>

1411
01:59:35,586 --> 01:59:37,129
I think we need to go.

1412
01:59:37,588 --> 01:59:39,090
This plan's gonna work.

1413
01:59:39,757 --> 01:59:41,175
I think so, too.

1414
01:59:41,258 --> 01:59:44,261
And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.

1415
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:47,139
I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

1416
01:59:47,431 --> 01:59:48,933
What if they don't either?

1417
01:59:49,892 --> 01:59:51,894
What if all of us refuse to shoot first?

1418
01:59:52,228 --> 01:59:54,355
We might still end up dead.

1419
01:59:55,272 --> 01:59:57,942
Maybe not.
I mean, it worked for us last time.

1420
01:59:58,651 --> 02:00:00,736
They're not gonna
make that same mistake again.

1421
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:04,115
You know and I know there's only
one person walking out of here.

1422
02:00:04,198 --> 02:00:05,866
And it's gonna be one of us.

1423
02:00:08,744 --> 02:00:10,496
The Careers are still out there.

1424
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:14,458
We should stick with these guys
till midnight.

1425
02:00:15,084 --> 02:00:17,712
And if we hear a cannon, we go.

1426
02:00:30,516 --> 02:00:34,145
Katniss, I don't know what kinda deals
you made with Haymitoh

1427
02:00:34,228 --> 02:00:36,105
but he made me promises, too.

1428
02:00:46,615 --> 02:00:49,952
If you die and I live,

1429
02:00:52,997 --> 02:00:54,623
I'd have nothing.

1430
02:00:56,125 --> 02:00:58,127
Nobody else that I care about.

1431
02:00:58,502 --> 02:00:59,670
Peeta.

1432
02:00:59,962 --> 02:01:01,338
It's different for you.

1433
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:03,090
Your family needs you.

1434
02:01:12,141 --> 02:01:13,309
You have to live.

1435
02:01:14,643 --> 02:01:15,936
For them.

1436
02:01:25,571 --> 02:01:26,989
What about you?

1437
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:30,993
Nobody needs me.

1438
02:01:34,038 --> 02:01:35,164
I do.

1439
02:01:36,373 --> 02:01:37,750
I need you.

1440
02:02:02,233 --> 02:02:04,068
All right, lovebirds!

1441
02:02:10,115 --> 02:02:12,326
She is preparing to fight.

1442
02:02:12,409 --> 02:02:14,036
That's our girl.

1443
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:20,251
This is what you predicted.

1444
02:02:27,216 --> 02:02:29,385
Moves and countermoves.

1445
02:02:30,427 --> 02:02:31,554
Indeed.

1446
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:37,726
We'll toast when it's done?

1447
02:02:39,144 --> 02:02:42,898
In the meantime, make
yourself comfortable.

1448
02:03:50,591 --> 02:03:52,092
Minimal charring.

1449
02:03:52,509 --> 02:03:54,136
It's an impressive conductor.

1450
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:55,971
Let's get started.

1451
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:02,811
Typically a lightning strike
contains five billion joules of energy.

1452
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,982
We don't want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits.

1453
02:04:08,192 --> 02:04:10,319
You two girls, go together now.

1454
02:04:10,694 --> 02:04:13,197
Take this. Unspool it carefully.

1455
02:04:13,322 --> 02:04:15,240
Make sure the entire coil is in the water.
You understand?

1456
02:04:15,324 --> 02:04:18,327
Then head to the tree at the 2:00 sector.
We'll meet you there.

1457
02:04:18,827 --> 02:04:20,537
I'm gonna go with them as a guard.

1458
02:04:20,663 --> 02:04:22,706
No,no,no.
You're staying here to protect me.

1459
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:24,833
And the tree.

1460
02:04:25,292 --> 02:04:26,669
No, I need to go with her.

1461
02:04:26,835 --> 02:04:29,546
There are two Careers out there.
I need two guards.

1462
02:04:30,506 --> 02:04:32,424
Finnick can protect you
just fine on his own.

1463
02:04:32,508 --> 02:04:36,053
Why can't Finnick and Johanna stay with
you and Peeta and I'll take the coil?

1464
02:04:36,637 --> 02:04:39,348
You all agreed to keep me alive
till midnight, correct?

1465
02:04:39,807 --> 02:04:42,184
It's his plan. We all agreed to it.

1466
02:04:42,351 --> 02:04:43,894
Is there a problem here?

1467
02:04:44,353 --> 02:04:45,562
Excellent question.

1468
02:04:47,982 --> 02:04:50,526
No. There's no problem.

1469
02:04:57,533 --> 02:04:58,909
I'll see you at midnight.

1470
02:05:00,035 --> 02:05:01,787
All right, let's go!

1471
02:05:31,025 --> 02:05:32,026
Come on.

1472
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:36,238
I want to put as much distance
between me and this beach as possible.

1473
02:05:36,655 --> 02:05:38,907
Frying is not how I want to go.

1474
02:05:39,575 --> 02:05:40,909
There's something...

1475
02:05:59,053 --> 02:06:01,055
Stay down.

1476
02:06:08,562 --> 02:06:09,605
Come on.

1477
02:06:28,457 --> 02:06:30,375
Johanna, where are you?

1478
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,971
Johanna?

1479
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:48,811
Peeta.

1480
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:04,451
Peeta.

1481
02:07:18,173 --> 02:07:20,008
Beetee. Beetee!

1482
02:07:32,354 --> 02:07:33,564
Peeta!

1483
02:07:39,403 --> 02:07:40,404
Peeta!

1484
02:07:55,043 --> 02:07:56,628
Katniss, where are you?

1485
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:07,222
Let it fly, Miss Everdeen.

1486
02:08:07,764 --> 02:08:10,184
Let it fly.

1487
02:08:19,902 --> 02:08:21,069
Katniss.

1488
02:08:25,407 --> 02:08:27,701
Remember who the real enemy is.

1489
02:09:06,073 --> 02:09:07,574
Katniss, get away from that tree!

1490
02:09:14,206 --> 02:09:15,999
Katniss, get away from that tree!

1491
02:09:35,894 --> 02:09:37,771
It's not possible.

1492
02:09:41,191 --> 02:09:42,567
Heavensbee!

1493
02:09:46,321 --> 02:09:48,573
Plutarch Heavensbee!

1494
02:09:53,829 --> 02:09:56,164
Sir, we've lost power.

1495
02:12:22,978 --> 02:12:25,814
She's gonna lose it
when she finds out about the boy.

1496
02:12:26,273 --> 02:12:27,941
She'll still cooperate, though?

1497
02:12:28,525 --> 02:12:30,610
Without Peeta? There's no guarantee.

1498
02:12:30,819 --> 02:12:32,154
Just tell her her win...

1499
02:12:37,784 --> 02:12:38,994
Morning, sweetheart.

1500
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,002
What are you doing with them?

1501
02:12:47,711 --> 02:12:50,464
You and a syringe against The Capitol?

1502
02:12:50,672 --> 02:12:52,924
See, this is why
no one lets you make the plans.

1503
02:12:53,383 --> 02:12:55,093
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- Stop.

1504
02:12:55,177 --> 02:12:57,262
Stop. Just listen.

1505
02:12:57,345 --> 02:13:00,348
We couldn't tell you with Snow watching.
It was too risky.

1506
02:13:01,016 --> 02:13:02,684
Better for you to know nothing.

1507
02:13:05,187 --> 02:13:06,313
Where's Peeta?

1508
02:13:06,396 --> 02:13:07,647
Now, Katniss...

1509
02:13:07,731 --> 02:13:09,774
You have been our mission
from the beginning.

1510
02:13:10,066 --> 02:13:12,027
The plan was always to get you out.

1511
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:14,154
Half the Tributes were in on it.

1512
02:13:14,362 --> 02:13:17,949
This is the revolution.
And you are the Mockingjay.

1513
02:13:19,159 --> 02:13:21,620
And we're on our way
to District 13 right now.

1514
02:13:21,703 --> 02:13:22,829
13?

1515
02:13:22,913 --> 02:13:24,664
13. Yes.

1516
02:13:24,873 --> 02:13:26,249
Where's Peeta?

1517
02:13:27,542 --> 02:13:31,213
He still has his tracker in his arm.
Johanna cut yours out.

1518
02:13:32,214 --> 02:13:33,340
Where is he?

1519
02:13:33,715 --> 02:13:34,883
In The Capitol.

1520
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:38,386
They got him and Johanna.

1521
02:13:38,887 --> 02:13:41,932
You son of a bitch! You son of a...

1522
02:13:42,015 --> 02:13:45,018
You promised me that
you would save him over me!

1523
02:13:45,101 --> 02:13:49,773
You promised me! You're a liar.
You're a liar.

1524
02:14:13,255 --> 02:14:14,673
Hey, Catnip.

1525
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:16,967
You're okay.

1526
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:18,969
You've just been
asleep for a few days.

1527
02:14:19,052 --> 02:14:20,262
Are we home?

1528
02:14:29,396 --> 02:14:30,522
Gale?

1529
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:33,567
Where's Prim?

1530
02:14:34,067 --> 02:14:35,402
She's alive.

1531
02:14:36,486 --> 02:14:38,780
So is your mother.
I got 'em out in time.

1532
02:14:40,115 --> 02:14:41,575
Got them out?

1533
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:46,121
After The Games, they
sent in hovercrafts.

1534
02:14:49,249 --> 02:14:51,793
And they started dropping firebombs.

1535
02:14:56,172 --> 02:14:57,841
They're not in 12?

1536
02:15:00,051 --> 02:15:02,012
There is no District 12.

1537
02:15:03,597 --> 02:15:05,098
It's all gone.
