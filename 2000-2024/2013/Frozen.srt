00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,615
<i>Born of cold and winter air.</i>

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,804
<i>And mountain rain combining.</i>

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,135
<i>This icy force both
foul and fair.</i>

4
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,484
<i>Has a frozen heart
worth mining.</i>

5
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,535
<i>So cut through the heart.</i>

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,015
<i>Cold and clear.</i>

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,010
<i>Strike for love and
strike for fear.</i>

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,891
<i>See the beauty
sharp and sheer.</i>

9
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,885
<i>Split the ice apart.</i>

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,840
<i>And break the frozen
heart Hup, ho.</i>

11
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,288
<i>Watch your step Let it go.</i>

12
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,768
<i>Hup, ho.</i>

13
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,561
<i>Watch your step Let it go.</i>

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,975
<i>Beautiful Powerful.</i>

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,335
<i>Dangerous Cold.</i>

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,655
<i>Ice has a magic Can't
be controlled.</i>

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,895
<i>Stronger than one.</i>

18
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,081
<i>Stronger than ten.</i>

19
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,965
<i>Stronger than a hundred men!</i>

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,326
Om.

21
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,815
<i>Born of cold And winter air.</i>

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,135
<i>And mountain rain combining.</i>

<i>This icy force both

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,245
<i>Has a frozen heart
worth mining.</i>

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,695
<i>Cut through the heart.</i>

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,895
<i>Cold and clear.</i>

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,082
<i>Strike for love and

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,602
<i>There's beauty and
there's danger here.</i>

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,922
<i>Split the ice apart.</i>

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,210
<i>Beware the frozen heart.</i>

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,927
Come on, Sven.

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,485
Elsa. Psst!

33
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,365
Elsa!

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,688
Wake-up. Wake-up. Wake-up!

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,321
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,808
I just can't.

37
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,925
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,129
So, we have to play.

39
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,123
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,248
Do you want to build a snowman?

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,927
Come on, come on, come on!

42
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,849
Do the magic!

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,486
Oh...

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,929
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,129
This is amazing!

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,211
Watch this!

47
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,135
Hi, I'm Olaf,

48
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,815
and I like warm hugs.

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,444
I love you, Olaf!

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,884
Olaf...

51
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,401
Tickle bumps!

52
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,846
Oh!

53
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,561
Hang on!

54
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,015
Catch me!

55
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,055
Gotcha!

56
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,286
Again!

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,601
Wait!

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,487
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down!

59
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,815
Whoo!

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,046
Anna!

61
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,526
Anna!

62
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,043
Mama! Papa!

63
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,204
No, no...

64
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,285
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,846
Elsa, what have you done?

66
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
This is getting out of hand.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,443
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!

68
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,365
- Oh. She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

69
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,446
Ice?

70
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,095
Faster, Sven.

71
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,121
Sven!

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,082
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

73
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,527
It's the King.

74
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,329
- Trolls?
- Shush!

75
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,805
I'm trying to listen.

76
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,971
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,445
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,484
Born with the powers, or cursed?

79
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,001
Born. And they're
getting stronger.

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,531
Here, here.

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,364
You are lucky it
wasn't her heart.

82
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,730
The heart is not
so easily changed.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,526
But the head can be persuaded.

84
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,410
Do what you must.

85
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,086
I recommend we remove all magic.

86
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,842
Even memories of
magic, to be safe.

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,809
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.

88
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,211
She will be okay.

89
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,888
But she won't remember
I have powers?

90
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,935
It's for the best.

91
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,284
Listen to me, Elsa. Your
power will only grow.

92
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,921
There is beauty in it...

93
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,289
But also great danger.

94
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,760
You must learn to control it.

95
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,563
Fear will be your enemy.

96
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,561
No!

97
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,295
We'll protect her.

98
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,448
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.

99
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,045
<i>Until then...</i>

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,844
<i>We'll lock the gates.</i>

101
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,575
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,887
<i>We will limit her
contact with people,</i>

103
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,044
<i>and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.</i>

104
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,170
<i>Including Anna.</i>

105
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,524
Ah.

106
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,366
Elsa?

107
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,845
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

108
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,647
<i>Come on, let's go and play.</i>

109
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,603
<i>I never see you anymore.</i>

110
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,046
<i>Come out the door.</i>

111
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,806
<i>It's like you've gone away.</i>

112
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,921
<i>We used to be best buddies
And now we're not.</i>

113
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,001
<i>I wish you would tell me why.</i>

114
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,966
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,935
<i>It doesn't have
to be a snowman.</i>

116
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,610
Go away, Anna.

117
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,530
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,891
The gloves will help.

119
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,289
See? Conceal it.

120
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,970
Don't feel it.

121
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,724
Don't let it show.

122
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,615
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

123
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,881
<i>Or ride our bike
around the halls?</i>

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,135
<i>I think some company
is overdue.</i>

125
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,004
<i>I've started talking To the
pictures on the walls.</i>

126
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,255
Hang in there, Joan.

127
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,762
<i>It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms.</i>

128
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,691
<i>Just watching the
hours tick by</i>

129
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,135
I'm scared.

130
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,215
It's getting stronger!

131
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,055
Getting upset only makes
it worse. Calm down.

132
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,855
No! Don't touch me!

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,008
Please, I don't
want to hurt you.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,684
See you in two weeks!

135
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,961
Do you have to go?

136
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,369
You'll be fine, Elsa.

137
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,325
Your Highness.

138
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,641
Elsa?

139
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,887
<i>Please I know you're in there.</i>

140
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,447
<i>People are asking
where you've been.</i>

141
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,329
<i>They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to.</i>

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,689
<i>I'm right out here for you.</i>

143
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,007
<i>Just let me in.</i>

144
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,050
<i>We only have each other
It's just you and me.</i>

145
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,571
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

146
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,240
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

147
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,255
All ashore!

148
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,486
Welcome to Arendelle!

149
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,215
Watch your step, please.

150
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,890
The gates will be opening soon.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,895
Why do I have to wear this?

152
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,048
Because the Queen
has come of age.

153
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,975
It's Coronation Day!

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,809
That's not my fault.

155
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,295
What do you want, Sven?

156
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,615
"Give me a snack."

157
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,295
What's the magic word?

158
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,375
"Please."

159
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,289
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

160
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,015
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

161
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,681
And for a whole day!
Faster, Percy!

162
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,007
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

163
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,324
Open those gates so I may unlock

164
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,841
your secrets and
exploit your riches.

165
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,726
Did I say that out loud?

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,655
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait

167
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,330
to see the Queen
and the Princess.

168
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,488
I bet they are
absolutely lovely.

169
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,682
I bet they are beautiful.

170
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,364
Princess Anna?

171
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,602
- Princess Anna?
- Huh? Yeah?

172
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,766
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

173
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,695
No, no, no, you didn't.

174
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,290
I've been up for hours.

175
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,966
Who is it?

176
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,855
Still me, ma'am.

177
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,645
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

178
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,815
Of course.

179
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,055
Ready for what?

180
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,615
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

181
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,961
My sister's corneration.

182
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,848
It's Coronation Day!

183
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,963
It's Coronation Day!

184
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,375
<i>The window is open!</i>

185
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,535
<i>So's that door!</i>

186
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,855
<i>I didn't know they
did that anymore.</i>

187
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,930
<i>Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?</i>

188
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,762
<i>For years I've roamed
these empty halls.</i>

189
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,362
<i>Why have a ballroom
with no balls?</i>

190
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,765
<i>Finally They're
opening up the gates!</i>

191
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,775
<i>There'll be actual,
real, live people.</i>

192
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,775
<i>It'll be totally strange.</i>

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,850
<i>But wow! Am I so ready
for this change!</i>

194
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,449
<i>'Cause for the first
time in forever.</i>

195
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,415
<i>There'll be music.</i>

196
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,205
<i>There'll be light.</i>

197
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,575
<i>For the first time.</i>

198
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,602
<i>In forever.</i>

199
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,648
<i>I'll be dancing
through the night.</i>

200
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,975
<i>Don't know if I'm
elated or gassy.</i>

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,765
<i>But I'm somewhere in that zone</i>

202
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,802
<i>'Cause for the first
time in forever.</i>

203
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,649
<i>I won't be alone</i>

204
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,610
I can't wait to meet everyone!

205
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,166
What if I meet The One?

206
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,295
<i>Tonight Imagine
me gown and all.</i>

207
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,615
<i>Fetchingly draped
against the wall.</i>

208
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,964
<i>The picture of
sophisticated Grace.</i>

209
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,615
<i>I suddenly see him
standing there.</i>

210
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,855
<i>A beautiful stranger.</i>

211
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,935
<i>Tall and fair.</i>

212
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,522
<i>I wanna stuff some
chocolate in my face!</i>

213
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,335
<i>But then we laugh and
talk all evening.</i>

214
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,615
<i>Which is totally bizarre.</i>

215
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,645
<i>Nothing like the life
I've led so far.</i>

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,005
<i>For the first time in forever.</i>

217
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,683
<i>There'll be magic
There'll be fun.</i>

218
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,164
<i>For the first time in forever.</i>

219
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,883
<i>I could be noticed by someone.</i>

220
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,567
<i>And I know it is
totally crazy.</i>

221
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,201
<i>To dream I'd find romance.</i>

222
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,209
<i>But for the first
time in forever.</i>

223
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,287
<i>At least I've got a chance!</i>

224
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,769
<i>Don't let them in.</i>

225
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,202
<i>Don't let them see.</i>

226
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,135
<i>Be the good girl.</i>

227
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,730
<i>You always have to be.</i>

228
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,046
<i>Conceal.</i>

229
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,051
<i>Don't feel.</i>

230
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,243
<i>Put on a show.</i>

231
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,095
<i>Make one wrong move.</i>

232
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,691
<i>And everyone will know.</i>

233
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,655
<i>But it's only for today.</i>

234
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,695
<i>It's only for today.</i>

235
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,485
<i>It's agony to wait.</i>

236
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,491
<i>Tell the guards to open up.</i>

237
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,655
<i>The gate.</i>

238
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,728
<i>The gate.</i>

239
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,215
<i>For the first time in forever.</i>

240
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,575
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see.</i>

241
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,241
<i>I'm getting what
I'm dreaming of.</i>

242
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,495
<i>Be the good girl.</i>

243
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,726
<i>You always have to be.</i>

244
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,215
<i>A chance to change.</i>

245
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,055
<i>My lonely world.</i>

246
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,375
Conceal.

247
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,695
<i>A chance to find true love.</i>

248
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,775
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know.</i>

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,848
<i>I know it all ends tomorrow.</i>

250
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,770
<i>So it has to be today!</i>

251
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,768
<i>'Cause for the first
time in forever.</i>

252
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,735
<i>For the first time.</i>

253
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,162
<i>In forever.</i>

254
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,125
<i>Nothing's in my way!</i>

255
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,095
Hey!

256
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,451
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

257
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,935
Hey.

258
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,935
Uh... No, no, I'm okay.

259
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,135
Are you sure?

260
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,895
Yeah. I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

261
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,002
But I'm great, actually.

262
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,289
Oh... Thank goodness.

263
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,280
Oh! Uh...

264
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,129
Prince Hans of the
Southern Isles.

265
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,449
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

266
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,095
"Princess"? My Lady.

267
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,326
<i>"UN."</i>

268
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,255
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

269
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,645
- Um...
- Whew.

270
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,255
Hi. Again.

271
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,009
Oh, boy!

272
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,921
This is awkward.

273
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,695
Not "You're awkward," but
just because we're...

274
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,041
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

275
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:48,495
I'd like to formally apologize

276
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,727
for hitting the Princess of
Arendelle with my horse.

277
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,175
And for every moment after.

278
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,645
No! No, no. It's fine.

279
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,006
I'm not that Princess.

280
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,855
I mean, if you had
hit my sister Elsa,

281
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,695
it would be... Yeesh!

282
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,255
Because, you know...

283
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,486
Hello.

284
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,284
But, lucky you,

285
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,244
it's just me.

286
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,887
"Jus" you?

287
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,045
The bells. The coronation.

288
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,335
I better go.

289
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,931
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

290
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,601
Bye!

291
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,124
Oh, no. Oh!

292
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,602
Your Majesty, the gloves.

293
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,404
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

294
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,922
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

295
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,571
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

296
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,125
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

297
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,655
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

298
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,855
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to...

299
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,120
Oh. Okay.

300
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,247
Hi.

301
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,244
"Hi" me? Oh...

302
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,130
Um... Hi.

303
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,335
You look beautiful.

304
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,455
Thank you. You look
beautiful-ler.

305
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,015
I mean, not "Fuller."
You don't look Fuller.

306
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,135
But more beautiful.

307
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,969
Thank you.

308
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,326
So...

309
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,409
This is what a party looks like.

310
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,375
It's warmer than I thought.

311
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,528
What is that amazing smell?

312
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,526
Chocolate.

313
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
Your Majesty.

314
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,845
- The Duke of Weaseltown.
- "Weselton"!

315
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,844
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

316
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,655
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

317
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,855
that I offer you

318
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,450
your first dance as Queen.

319
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,165
One-two, and jump.

320
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,681
Uh...

321
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,895
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

322
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,046
Oh...

323
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
But my sister does.

324
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,481
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.

325
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,695
Oh, I don't think...

326
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,927
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.

327
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,815
Sorry.

328
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,695
Like an agile peacock.

329
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,529
Ow! Ow.

330
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,564
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

331
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,722
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

332
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,695
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

333
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,449
- No.
- No.

334
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,891
All right. Hang on!

335
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,895
They don't call me the
"Little Dipper" for nothing!

336
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,055
Oh-ho!

337
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,527
Like a chicken with the
face of a monkey, I fly.

338
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,695
Let me know when you're ready

339
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,801
for another round, Milady.

340
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,651
Well, he was sprightly.

341
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,964
Especially for a man in heels.

342
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,650
Are you okay?

343
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,449
I've never been better.
This is so nice.

344
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,922
I wish it could be like
this all the time.

345
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,760
Me, too.

346
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,655
But it can't.

347
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,682
- Why not?
- It just can't.

348
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,570
Excuse me for a minute.

349
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,049
I'd be honored.

350
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,681
Glad I caught you.

351
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,126
Hans.

352
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,165
Oop.

353
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,655
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

354
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,603
- Oh!
- Oops.

355
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,095
Sorry.

356
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,495
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.

357
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,806
Ah.

358
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,455
What's this?

359
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,935
Uh, I was born with it.

360
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,167
Although, I dreamed I
was kissed by a troll.

361
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,775
I like it.

362
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,455
Yeah, the whole thing.

363
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,561
You got it.

364
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,566
Okay, wait, wait. So, you
have how many brothers?

365
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,689
Twelve older brothers.

366
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,088
Three of them pretended
I was invisible,

367
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,323
literally, for two years.

368
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,646
That's horrible.

369
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,286
It's what brothers do.

370
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,011
And sisters.

371
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,695
Elsa and I were really
close when we were little.

372
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,175
But then, one day, she
just shut me out,

373
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,521
and I never knew why.

374
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,125
I would never shut you out.

375
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,961
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

376
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,566
I love crazy.

377
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,449
<i>All my life has been A
series of doors in my face.</i>

378
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,575
<i>And then suddenly
I bump into you</i>

379
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,935
I was thinking the same
thing, because, like...

380
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,095
<i>I've been searching
my whole life.</i>

381
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,009
<i>To find my own place.</i>

382
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,761
<i>And maybe it's the
party talking.</i>

383
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,881
<i>Or the chocolate fondue.</i>

384
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,055
<i>But with you.</i>

385
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,295
<i>But with you I found my place.</i>

386
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,015
<i>I see your face.</i>

387
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,015
<i>And it's nothing like
I've ever known before.</i>

388
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,055
<i>Love is an open.</i>

389
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,209
<i>Door!</i>

390
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,015
<i>Love is an open.</i>

391
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,169
- <i>Door.
- Door.</i>

392
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,695
<i>"BOTH". Love is an open door.</i>

393
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,455
- <i>With you.
- With you.</i>

394
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,245
<i>"BOTH". Love is an open door.</i>

395
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,041
- <i>I mean, it's crazy.
- What?</i>

396
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,322
- <i>We finish each
other's Sandwiches.</i>

397
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,735
That's what I was gonna say!

398
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,935
<i>I've never met someone.</i>

399
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,962
<i>"BOTH". Who thinks
so much like me.</i>

400
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,535
Jinx! Jinx again!

401
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,009
<i>Our mental synchronization Can
have but one explanation.</i>

402
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,655
- <i>You.
- And I.</i>

403
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,735
- <i>Were.
- Just.</i>

404
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,250
<i>"BOTH". Meant to be.</i>

405
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,935
- <i>Say goodbye.
- Say goodbye.</i>

406
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,804
<i>"BOTH". To the
pain of the past.</i>

407
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,449
<i>We don't have to
feel it anymore.</i>

408
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,646
<i>Love is an open door.</i>

409
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,085
<i>Love is an open.</i>

410
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,249
- <i>Door.
- Door.</i>

411
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,295
<i>"BOTH". Life can
be so much more.</i>

412
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,295
- <i>With you.
- With you.</i>

413
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,655
<i>"BOTH". Love is an open.</i>

414
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,162
- <i>Door.
- Door.</i>

415
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,449
Can I say something crazy?

416
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,444
Will you marry me?

417
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,644
Can I say something
even crazier?

418
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,201
Yes!

419
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,569
Coming through. Excuse me.
Oh...

420
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,535
Pardon. Sorry. Oh!

421
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,085
Can we just get
around you there?

422
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,244
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

423
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,615
Elsa!

424
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,325
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

425
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,087
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

426
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,970
Your Majesty.

427
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,735
We would like...

428
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,761
Uh, your blessing...

429
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,804
Of our marriage.

430
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,084
- Marriage?
- Yes!

431
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,815
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

432
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,135
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

433
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,055
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

434
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,375
Of course, we'll have soup, roast
and ice cream. And then...

435
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,561
Wait. Would we live here?

436
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,975
- Here?
- Absolutely!

437
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,055
- Anna!
- Oh!

438
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,570
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

439
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,935
What? No, no, no.

440
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,088
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.

441
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,295
No one's brothers
are staying here.

442
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,685
No one is getting married.

443
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,495
Wait, what?

444
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,364
May I talk to you, please?
Alone.

445
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,601
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

446
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,006
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

447
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,215
You can if it's true love.

448
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,129
Anna, what do you
know about true love?

449
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,335
More than you.

450
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,124
All you know is how
to shut people out.

451
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,971
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

452
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,687
Now, excuse me.

453
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,415
Your Majesty, if I
may ease your...

454
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,522
No, you may not. And I
think you should go.

455
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,789
The party is over.
Close the gates.

456
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:01,895
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?

457
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,410
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

458
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,601
Give me my glove!

459
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,530
Elsa, please, please.

460
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,404
I can't live like this anymore!

461
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,327
Then leave.

462
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,565
What did I ever do to you?

463
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,895
Enough, Anna.

464
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,968
No, why? Why do you shut me out?

465
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,685
Why do you shut the world out?

466
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,524
What are you so afraid of?

467
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,490
I said, enough!

468
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,006
Sorcery.

469
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,086
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

470
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,046
Elsa.

471
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,241
There she is!

472
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,335
Yes! It is her!

473
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,486
Queen Elsa.

474
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,250
Our beautiful Queen!

475
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,728
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

476
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,081
No.

477
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,046
There she is! Stop her!

478
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,408
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.

479
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,762
Monster. Monster!

480
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,201
{SHUDDERS)

481
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,806
Elsa!

482
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,724
Elsa!

483
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
Wait, please!

484
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,615
Elsa, stop!

485
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,801
Anna!

486
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,001
No.

487
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,966
The fjord.

488
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,724
- Snow!
- Snow?

489
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,175
Yes, snow.

490
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,964
- Are you all right?
- No.

491
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,565
Did you know?

492
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,287
No.

493
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,725
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!

494
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,444
The Queen has cursed this land!

495
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,775
She must be stopped! You
have to go after her.

496
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,040
Wait, no!

497
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,695
You! Is there sorcery
in you, too?

498
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,210
Are you a monster, too?

499
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,335
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

500
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,850
That's right, she is.

501
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,324
In the best way.

502
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,135
And my sister is not a monster.

503
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,775
She nearly killed me!

504
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,375
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.

505
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,641
It was an accident.
She was scared.

506
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,691
She didn't mean it. She
didn't mean any of this.

507
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,521
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.

508
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,926
So, I'm the one

509
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,295
- that needs to go after her.
- What?

510
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,695
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no.

511
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,926
It's too dangerous.

512
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,930
Elsa is not dangerous.

513
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,255
I'll bring her back, and
I'll make this right.

514
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,335
I'm coming with you.

515
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,569
No, I need you here to
take care of Arendelle.

516
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,565
On my honor.

517
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,245
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

518
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,925
Are you sure you can trust her?

519
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,971
I don't want you getting hurt.

520
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,601
She's my sister.

521
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,531
She would never hurt me.

522
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,935
<i>The snow glows white On
the mountain tonight.</i>

523
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,964
<i>Not a footprint to be seen.</i>

524
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,935
<i>A kingdom of isolation.</i>

525
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,806
<i>And it looks like
I'm the Queen.</i>

526
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,535
<i>The wind is howling.</i>

527
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,281
<i>Like this swirling
storm inside.</i>

528
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,162
<i>Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried.</i>

529
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,775
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see.</i>

530
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,295
<i>Be the good girl You
always have to be.</i>

531
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,042
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know.</i>

532
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,489
<i>Well, now they know.</i>

533
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,208
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

534
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,569
<i>Can't hold me back anymore.</i>

535
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,049
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

536
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,603
<i>Turn away and slam the door.</i>

537
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,807
<i>I don't care.</i>

538
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,208
<i>What they're going to say.</i>

539
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,248
<i>Let the storm rage on.</i>

540
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,531
<i>The cold never
bothered me anyway.</i>

541
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,843
<i>It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small.</i>

542
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,883
<i>And the fears that
once controlled me.</i>

543
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,931
<i>Can't get to me at all.</i>

544
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,935
<i>It's time to see
what I can do.</i>

545
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,407
<i>To test the limits
and break through.</i>

546
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,015
<i>No right, no wrong.</i>

547
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,122
<i>No rules for me.</i>

548
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,364
<i>I'm free!</i>

549
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,491
<i>Let it go!</i>

550
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,410
<i>Let it go!</i>

551
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,055
<i>I am one with the
wind and sky.</i>

552
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,402
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

553
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,128
<i>You'll never see me cry.</i>

554
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,255
<i>Here I stand.</i>

555
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,931
<i>And here I'll stay.</i>

556
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,807
<i>Let the storm rage on.</i>

557
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,015
<i>My power flurries
through the air.</i>

558
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,203
<i>Into the ground.</i>

559
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,295
<i>My soul is spiraling
in frozen fractals.</i>

560
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,448
<i>All around.</i>

561
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,880
<i>And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast.</i>

562
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,486
<i>I'm never going back.</i>

563
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,891
<i>The past is in the past.</i>

564
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,484
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

565
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,488
<i>And I'll rise like
the break of Dawn.</i>

566
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,809
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

567
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,001
<i>That perfect girl is gone.</i>

568
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,646
<i>Here I stand.</i>

569
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,481
<i>In the light of day.</i>

570
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,405
<i>Let the storm rage on!</i>

571
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,011
<i>The cold never
bothered me anyway</i>

572
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,451
Elsa!

573
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Elsa!

574
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,404
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

575
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,650
your sister who didn't mean to
make you freeze the summer.

576
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,969
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

577
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:08,055
Of course, none of it
would have happened

578
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,844
if she had just
told me her secret.

579
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,011
She's a stinker.

580
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,205
Whoa!

581
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,646
Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back!

582
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,211
No, no, no!

583
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,451
Okay.

584
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,168
Snow. It had to be snow.

585
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,415
She couldn't have
had tropical magic

586
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,808
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

587
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,085
Fire!

588
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,530
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

589
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,524
Ooh. "And sauna"!

590
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,411
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

591
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,966
Big summer blowout.

592
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,442
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

593
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,206
and a sun balm of my
own invention, yah?

594
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,802
Oh. Great. For now,
um, how about boots?

595
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,124
Winter boots and dresses?

596
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,569
That would be in our
winter department.

597
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,931
Oh. Um...

598
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,680
I was just wondering.

599
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,848
Has another young woman...

600
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,695
The Queen perhaps, I don't know,

601
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,801
passed through here?

602
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,415
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

603
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,249
is you, dear.

604
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,320
You and this fellow.

605
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,495
<i>You-hoe.</i>

606
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,646
Big summer blowout.

607
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,801
Carrots.

608
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,126
Huh?

609
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,051
Behind you.

610
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,369
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

611
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,642
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

612
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,204
Wherever could it
be coming from?

613
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,411
The North Mountain.

614
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,320
North Mountain.

615
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,095
That Will be 40.

616
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,770
Forty? No, 10.

617
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,927
Oh, dear, that's no good.

618
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,969
See, this is from
our winter stock,

619
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,049
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

620
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,162
You want to talk about a
supply and demand problem?

621
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,527
I sell ice for a living.

622
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,975
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

623
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,241
I mean, that is really...

624
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,521
That's unfortunate.

625
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,975
Still 40.

626
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,048
But I will throw in a
visit to Oaken's sauna.

627
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,209
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

628
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,886
Yoo-hoo!

629
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,641
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

630
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,601
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.

631
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,055
Okay, just tell me one thing.

632
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,015
What was happening on
the North Mountain?

633
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,769
Did it seem magical?

634
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,450
Yes!

635
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,885
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

636
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,451
What did you call me?

637
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,210
Okay, okay. I'm out.

638
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,775
Whoa!

639
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,086
Bye-bye.

640
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,241
No, Sven, I didn't
get your carrots.

641
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,164
But I did find us
a place to sleep.

642
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,370
And it's free.

643
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,291
I'm sorry about this violence.

644
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,050
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

645
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,891
so we have good feelings.

646
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,730
Just the outfit and
the boots, yah?

647
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,161
Uh...

648
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,684
<i>Reindeers are
better than people.</i>

649
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,643
<i>Sven, don't you
think that's true?</i>

650
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,089
<i>"Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you.</i>

651
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,641
<i>"Every one of them's
bad, except you".</i>

652
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,604
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

653
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,249
<i>But people smell
better than reindeers.</i>

654
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,565
<i>Sven, don't you
think I'm right?</i>

655
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,967
<i>"That's once again true
For all, except you".</i>

656
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,455
<i>You got me Let's
call it a night.</i>

657
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,209
<i>"Good night".</i>

658
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,925
<i>Don't let the frostbite.</i>

659
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,401
<i>Bite.</i>

660
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,645
Nice duet.

661
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,726
It's just you.
What do you want?

662
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,362
I want you to take me
up the North Mountain.

663
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,290
I don't take people places.

664
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,735
Let me rephrase that.

665
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,205
Hey.

666
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,286
Take me up the North Mountain.

667
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,964
Please.

668
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,162
Look, I know how to
stop this winter.

669
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,130
We leave at Dawn.

670
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,722
And you forgot the
carrots for Sven.

671
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,975
Oops, sorry.

672
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,287
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't...

673
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,007
We leave now. Right now.

674
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,286
WheW!

675
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,375
Hang on! We like to go fast.

676
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,801
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

677
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,615
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

678
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,130
Seriously, were you
raised in a barn?

679
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,526
Ugh!

680
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,286
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.

681
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,205
So, uh, tell me,

682
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,443
what made the Queen
go all ice-crazy?

683
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,681
Oh. Well...

684
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,440
It was all my fault.

685
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,095
I got engaged, but
then she freaked out,

686
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,771
because I'd only just met
him, you know, that day.

687
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,770
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

688
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,415
Wait. You got engaged to
someone you just met that day?

689
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,735
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,

690
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,790
and then she tried to walk away,

691
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:55,855
and I grabbed her glove...

692
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,881
Hang on!

693
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,975
You mean to tell
me you got engaged

694
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,655
to someone you
just met that day?

695
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,920
Yes. Pay attention.

696
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,175
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time,

697
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,441
so I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.

698
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,484
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

699
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,969
Yes, they did.

700
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,761
But Hans is not a stranger.

701
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,850
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

702
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,406
"Of the Southern Isles."

703
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,891
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

704
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,375
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

705
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,469
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

706
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,055
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

707
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,286
Have you had a
meal with him yet?

708
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,895
What if you hate
the way he eats?

709
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,331
What if you hate the
way he picks his nose?

710
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,601
Picks his nose?

711
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,975
And eats it.

712
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,401
Excuse me, Sir. He is a Prince.

713
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,925
- All men do it.
- Ew.

714
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,470
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.

715
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:43,775
It doesn't sound like true love.

716
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,326
Are you some sort
of love expert?

717
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,606
No. But, uh, I have
friends who are.

718
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,215
You have friends

719
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,615
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.

720
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,130
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.

721
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,040
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.

722
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,961
Sven, go.

723
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,207
Go!

724
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,291
- What are they?
- Wolves.

725
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,527
Wolves?

726
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,455
- What do we do?
- I got this.

727
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,735
You just... Don't fall
off, and don't get eaten.

728
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,775
But I want to help!

729
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,895
- No.
- Why not?

730
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,975
Because I don't trust
your judgment.

731
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,255
Excuse me?

732
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,095
Who marries a man she just met?

733
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,415
It's true love!

734
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,655
Whoa!

735
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,091
VVhoa. VVhoa!

736
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,685
Christopher!

737
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,295
It's "Kristoff"!

738
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,651
Ow!

739
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,007
Duck!

740
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,651
You almost set me on fire!

741
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,761
But I didn't.

742
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,646
Get ready to jump, Sven!

743
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,171
You don't tell him what to do.

744
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,645
- Hey!
- I do!

745
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,761
Jump, Sven!

746
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,921
Phew!

747
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,686
But I just paid it Off.

748
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,844
Uh-oh. No. No.

749
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,495
No!

750
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,249
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

751
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,481
Grab on!

752
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,126
Pull, Sven. Pull!

753
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,090
Whoa.

754
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,488
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

755
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,081
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.

756
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,246
Of course I don't want to
help her anymore. In fact,

757
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,015
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

758
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,055
AN NAl It's this way?

759
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,048
"She'll die on her own."

760
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,884
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.

761
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,124
"But you won't get your
new sled if she's dead."

762
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,731
I think, actually, it's up.

763
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,375
Sometimes, I really
don't like you.

764
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,721
Hold up! We're coming.

765
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,375
You are?

766
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,483
I mean, sure. I'll
let you tag along.

767
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,005
Arendelle.

768
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,728
It's completely frozen.

769
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,055
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.

770
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,415
Will she?

771
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,095
Yeah. Now, come on.

772
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,884
This way to the North Mountain?

773
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,446
More like this way.

774
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,962
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

775
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,360
Yeah.

776
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,483
It really is
beautiful, isn't it?

777
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,161
But it's so white.

778
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,410
You know, how about
a little color?

779
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,849
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

780
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,445
How about yellow?

781
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,763
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?

782
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,411
No go.

783
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,730
Am I right?

784
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,215
- Hi.
- You're creepy.

785
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,550
- Whoa!
- I don't want it.

786
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:49,055
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.

787
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,335
- No.
- Come on, it's just a head.

788
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,655
All right. We got
off to a bad start.

789
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,886
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

790
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,775
Wait, what am I
looking at right now?

791
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,495
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

792
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,851
All right, wait one second.

793
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,331
Oh. Uh...

794
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,735
Oh!

795
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,125
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

796
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
Now, I'm perfect.

797
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,886
Well, almost.

798
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,120
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

799
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,241
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

800
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:17,335
- Head rush!
- I was just... Are you okay?

801
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,682
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

802
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,530
I've always wanted a nose.

803
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,095
So cute.

804
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,855
It's like a little baby unicorn.

805
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,975
But... Hey! Whoa!

806
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,015
Oh.

807
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,849
I love it even more.

808
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,885
All right, let's start
this thing over.

809
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,215
Hi, everyone.

810
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,295
I'm Olaf.

811
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,526
And I like warm hugs.

812
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,081
Olaf?

813
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,209
That's right. Olaf.

814
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,408
And you are?

815
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,881
Oh. Um...

816
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,215
I'm Anna.

817
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,655
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

818
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,215
- That's Sven.
- Uh-huh.

819
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,175
And who's the reindeer?

820
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,215
Sven.

821
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,055
Oh, the... Oh. Okay. That
makes things easier for me.

822
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,560
Aw, look at him trying
to kiss my nose.

823
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,683
- I like you, too.
- Olaf.

824
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,322
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?

825
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,641
Do you know where she is?

826
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,895
- Fascinating.
- Yeah. Why?

827
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,455
Do you think you could
show us the way?

828
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,481
Yeah. Why?

829
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,095
How does this work? Ow!

830
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,335
Stop it, Sven. I'm
trying to focus, here.

831
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,362
- <i>Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.</i>

832
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,445
We need Elsa to
bring back summer.

833
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,495
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

834
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,815
Oh. I don't know why,

835
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,575
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

836
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,082
And sun, and all things hot.

837
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,255
Really?

838
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,815
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.

839
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,921
Nope.

840
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,735
But sometimes I like
to close my eyes,

841
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,606
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

842
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,095
<i>Bees will buzz Kids will
blow dandelion fuzz.</i>

843
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,887
<i>And I'll be doing Whatever
snow does in summer.</i>

844
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,815
<i>A drink in my hand.</i>

845
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,215
<i>My snow up against
the burning sand.</i>

846
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,495
<i>Probably getting
gorgeously tanned.</i>

847
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,090
<i>In summer.</i>

848
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,855
<i>I'll finally see
a summer breeze.</i>

849
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,975
<i>Blow away a winter storm.</i>

850
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,255
<i>And find out what
happens to solid water.</i>

851
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,011
<i>When it gets warm.</i>

852
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,888
<i>And I can't wait to see.</i>

853
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,843
<i>What my buddies
all think of me.</i>

854
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,775
<i>Just imagine how
much cooler I'll be.</i>

855
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,007
<i>In summer!</i>

856
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,568
<i>The hot and the cold
are both so intense.</i>

857
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,047
<i>Put them together It
just makes sense.</i>

858
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,568
<i>Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle.</i>

859
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,523
<i>But put me in summer
and I'll be a...</i>

860
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,575
<i>Happy snowman!</i>

861
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,726
<i>When life gets rough.</i>

862
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,201
<i>I like to hold on to my dream.</i>

863
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,207
<i>Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam.</i>

864
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,445
<i>Oh, the sky.</i>

865
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,085
<i>Will be blue.</i>

866
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,524
<i>And you guys will
be there, too.</i>

867
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,655
<i>When I finally do.</i>

868
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,968
<i>What frozen things
do In summer!</i>

869
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,684
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

870
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,487
<i>In summer!</i>

871
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,535
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

872
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,735
Let's go bring back summer!

873
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm coming!

874
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,325
Somebody's gotta tell him.

875
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,015
No, no. You've got the
bark facing down.

876
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,565
The bark needs to be face-up.

877
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,215
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!

878
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,255
Bark down! Papa!

879
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,884
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

880
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,004
Arendelle is indebted
to you, Your Highness.

881
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,535
The castle is open.

882
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,530
There is soup and hot
glogg in the great hall.

883
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,895
Here, pass these out.

884
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,285
Prince Hans!

885
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,975
Are we expected to just
sit here and freeze

886
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,446
while you give away all of
Arendelle's tradable goods?

887
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:02,375
Princess Anna has
given her orders.

888
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,175
And that's another thing!

889
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,775
Has it dawned on you that your
Princess may be conspiring

890
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,926
with a wicked sorceress

891
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,175
to destroy us all?

892
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,770
Do not question the Princess.

893
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,455
She left me in charge

894
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,775
and I will not hesitate

895
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,325
to protect Arendelle
from treason.

896
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,130
Treason?

897
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,695
VVhoa! VVhoa!

898
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,495
Whoa, boy. Easy.

899
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,601
Easy.

900
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,921
It's Princess Anna's horse.

901
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,725
So, where is the Princess?

902
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,451
Where could she be?
Where is she?

903
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,605
Princess Anna is in trouble.

904
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,135
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

905
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,375
- <i>I'll go.
- I volunteer.</i>

906
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,368
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

907
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,291
Be prepared for anything.

908
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,642
And should you
encounter the Queen,

909
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,766
you are to put an
end to this winter.

910
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,891
- Do you understand?
- Hmm.

911
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,005
So, how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?

912
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,881
Oh. I am gonna
talk to my sister.

913
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,321
That's your plan?

914
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,335
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

915
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,566
Yep.

916
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,685
So, you're not at
all afraid of her?

917
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,690
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

918
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,443
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

919
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,650
Oh. Look at that.

920
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,007
I've been impaled.

921
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,327
What now?

922
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,809
Mmm...

923
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,775
It's too steep.

924
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,295
I've only got one rope and you
don't know how to climb mountains.

925
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,655
<i>Says who'?</i>

926
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,920
Hmm?

927
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,361
What are you doing?

928
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,446
I'm going to see my sister.

929
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,041
You're gonna kill yourself.

930
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,815
I wouldn't put my foot there.

931
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,490
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

932
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,615
How do you know Elsa
even wants to see you?

933
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,290
All right. I'm just
blocking you out

934
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,051
because I gotta
concentrate, here.

935
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,895
You know, most
people who disappear

936
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,360
into the mountains
want to be alone.

937
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,682
Nobody wants to be alone.

938
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,247
Except maybe you.

939
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,449
I'm not alone. I have
friends, remember?

940
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,164
You mean, the love experts?

941
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,363
Yes, the love experts.

942
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,564
Ah...

943
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,890
Please tell me I'm almost there.

944
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,362
Does the air seem a bit
thin to you up here?

945
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,095
Hang on.

946
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,121
Hey, Sven?

947
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,129
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

948
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,255
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly

949
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,455
where you wanted to go.

950
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,403
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

951
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,686
Thanks. That was like a
crazy trust exercise.

952
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,735
Whoa.

953
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,603
Now, that's ice.

954
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,775
I might cry.

955
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,371
Go ahead. I won't judge.

956
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,609
All right, take it easy, boy.
Come here.

957
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,285
<i>I got you.</i>

958
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,127
Okay. You stay
right here, buddy.

959
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,406
Flawless.

960
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,681
Knock.

961
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,011
Just knock.

962
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,570
Why isn't she knocking?

963
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,965
Do you think she
knows how to knock?

964
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,935
Huh. It opened.

965
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,246
That's a first.

966
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,495
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.

967
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,488
- What?
- The last time I introduced her to a guy,

968
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,975
she froze everything.

969
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,895
But, but... Oh, come on!

970
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,685
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!

971
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,975
Bye, Sven.

972
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,570
You, too, Olaf.

973
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,729
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

974
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,326
Okay.

975
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,090
One, two,

976
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,524
- three...
- Four...

977
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,081
Whoa.

978
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,361
Elsa?

979
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,243
It's me, Anna.

980
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,765
Anna.

981
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,962
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

982
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,090
It's a good different.

983
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,726
And this place...

984
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,366
It's amazing.

985
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,681
Thank you.

986
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,082
I never knew what
I was capable of.

987
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,455
I'm so sorry about what
happened. If I'd have known...

988
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,606
No, no, no. It's okay.

989
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,890
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

990
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,855
Please.

991
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,041
But I just got here.

992
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,364
You belong down in Arendelle.

993
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,855
So do you.

994
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,008
No, Anna, I belong here.

995
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,201
Alone.

996
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,650
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

997
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,883
Actually, about that...

998
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,170
- Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?

999
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,326
Hi! I'm Olaf and I
like warm hugs!

1000
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,167
Olaf?

1001
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,081
Yeah. You built me.

1002
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,841
Remember that?

1003
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,447
And you're alive?

1004
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,402
Um... I think so.

1005
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,486
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

1006
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,846
Yeah.

1007
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,249
Elsa, we were so close.

1008
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,324
We can be like that again.

1009
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,886
Catch me! Slow down!

1010
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,961
Anna!

1011
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,735
No.

1012
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,240
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1013
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,535
Elsa, wait.

1014
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,608
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

1015
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,411
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1016
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,083
Please don't shut me out again.

1017
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,495
<i>Please don't slam the door.</i>

1018
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,411
<i>You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore</i>

1019
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,410
<i>'Cause for the first
time in forever.</i>

1020
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,689
<i>I finally understand.</i>

1021
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,135
<i>For the first time in forever.</i>

1022
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,415
<i>We can fix this hand in hand.</i>

1023
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,408
We can head down this
mountain together.

1024
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,524
<i>You don't have to live in fear</i>

1025
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,361
<i>'Cause for the first
time in forever.</i>

1026
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,769
<i>I Will be right here</i>

1027
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,001
Anna.

1028
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,095
<i>Please go back home.</i>

1029
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,690
<i>Your life awaits.</i>

1030
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,128
<i>Go enjoy the sun And
open up the gates.</i>

1031
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,695
- Yeah, but...
- I know.

1032
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,850
<i>You mean well But leave me be.</i>

1033
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,535
<i>Yes, I'm alone.</i>

1034
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,404
<i>But I'm alone and free.</i>

1035
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,082
<i>Just stay away And
you'll be safe from me.</i>

1036
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,321
<i>Actually, we're not.</i>

1037
00:56:43,575 --> 00:56:44,735
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

1038
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,295
<i>I get the feeling
you don't know.</i>

1039
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,481
<i>What do I not know?</i>

1040
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,375
<i>Arendelle's in
deep, deep, deep.</i>

1041
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,482
<i>Deep snow.</i>

1042
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,841
What?

1043
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,802
You kind of set off an
eternal winter everywhere.

1044
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,201
Everywhere?

1045
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,089
Well, it's okay, you
can just unfreeze it.

1046
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,328
No, I can't. I don't know how.

1047
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,881
Sure you can. I know you can.

1048
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,601
<i>'Cause for the first
time in forever.</i>

1049
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,495
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!</i>

1050
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,682
<i>You don't have to be afraid.</i>

1051
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,815
<i>No escape from the
storm inside of me.</i>

1052
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,815
<i>We can work this out together.</i>

1053
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,604
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

1054
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,849
<i>We'll reverse the
storm you've made.</i>

1055
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,095
<i>Anna, please you'll
only make it worse!</i>

1056
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,202
<i>Don't panic There's
so much fear!</i>

1057
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,765
<i>We'll make the sun
shine bright.</i>

1058
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,295
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

1059
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,015
<i>We can face this
thing together.</i>

1060
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,095
<i>No!</i>

1061
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,255
<i>We can change this
winter weather.</i>

1062
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,568
<i>And everything
will be all right.</i>

1063
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,561
<i>I can't!</i>

1064
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,241
Anna!

1065
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,001
Are you okay?

1066
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,455
I'm okay.

1067
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,720
I'm fine.

1068
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,135
Who's this?

1069
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,571
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

1070
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,175
You have to go.

1071
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,885
No, I know we can figure
this out together.

1072
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,055
How?

1073
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,242
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1074
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,846
To stop me?

1075
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,535
Anna, I think we should go.

1076
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,449
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

1077
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,244
Yes, you are.

1078
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,775
Stop! Put us down!

1079
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,404
Go away.

1080
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,365
Heads up!

1081
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,366
Watch out for my butt!

1082
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,935
It is not nice to throw people!

1083
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.

1084
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,575
- Just calm down! Calm down!
- Okay! All right!

1085
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,255
- I'm okay.
- Just let the snowman be.

1086
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,441
- I'm calm.
- Great.

1087
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,125
Oh! Come on!

1088
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,815
Oh. Look, see? Now,
you made him mad.

1089
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,604
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1090
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,131
No, no! Not you guys!

1091
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,131
This just got a
whole lot harder.

1092
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,121
Look out!

1093
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,484
Run! Run!

1094
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,563
What are you doing?

1095
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,241
<i>I got him!</i>

1096
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,135
Whoa! Stop!

1097
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,207
It's a 100-foot drop.

1098
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,807
It's 200.

1099
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,321
OW!

1100
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,048
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

1101
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,690
Okay. What if We fall?

1102
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,000
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1103
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,855
It'll be like landing
on a pillow.

1104
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,881
Hopefully.

1105
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,175
Okay, Anna. On three.

1106
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,535
Okay. One...

1107
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,615
You tell me when.
I'm ready to go.

1108
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,255
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!

1109
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,361
Calm down.

1110
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,481
Tree!

1111
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,761
What the... Whoa!

1112
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,404
That happened.

1113
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,449
Man, am I out of shape.

1114
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,495
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1115
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,335
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1116
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,011
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.

1117
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,881
Hey! We were just
talking about you.

1118
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,008
All good things,
all good things.

1119
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,521
No!

1120
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,045
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1121
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,775
Olaf!

1122
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,564
Hang in there, guys!

1123
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,887
Go. Go faster!

1124
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,610
- Wait, what?
- Hey!

1125
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,575
Ow!

1126
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,886
Kristoff!

1127
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,608
Don't come back!

1128
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,321
We won't.

1129
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,284
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.

1130
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,686
Olaf!

1131
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,926
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

1132
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,409
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!

1133
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,925
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

1134
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,969
Oh. That feels better.

1135
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,721
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1136
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,135
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1137
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,083
Don't talk to him like that.

1138
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,964
You're tickling me.

1139
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,081
Here.

1140
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,575
Whoa!

1141
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,775
Are you okay?

1142
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,165
Thank you.

1143
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,326
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!

1144
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,415
It's fine. Uh...

1145
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,965
Uh, I'm good. I've
got a thick skull.

1146
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,929
I don't have a skull.

1147
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,721
Or bones.

1148
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,441
So, uh... So, now what?

1149
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,775
NOW What?

1150
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,086
Now what?

1151
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,281
Oh...

1152
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,840
What am I gonna do?

1153
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,815
She threw me out.

1154
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,175
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1155
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,255
And then there's
your ice business.

1156
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,806
Hey, hey. Don't worry
about my ice business.

1157
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,735
- Worry about your hair!
- What?

1158
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,615
I just fell off a Cliff.
You should see your hair.

1159
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,165
No, yours is turning white.

1160
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,091
White? It's... What?

1161
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,282
It's because she
struck you, isn't it?

1162
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,490
Does it look bad?

1163
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,931
- No.
- You hesitated.

1164
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,087
No, I didn't.

1165
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,535
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.

1166
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,050
Okay! Where are we going?

1167
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,335
To see my friends.

1168
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,655
The love experts?

1169
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,330
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.

1170
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,007
And don't worry, they'll
be able to fix this.

1171
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,810
How do you know?

1172
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,523
Because I've seen
them do it before.

1173
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,081
I like to consider
myself a love expert.

1174
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,370
Get it together.

1175
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,411
Control it.

1176
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,164
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1177
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,290
Don't feel.

1178
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,124
Don't feel!

1179
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,207
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1180
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,369
- Are you cold?
- A little.

1181
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,935
Uh... Wait. Come here.

1182
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,041
Huh?

1183
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,051
Ooh.

1184
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,728
So, uh, about my friends.
Well...

1185
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,206
I say "friends"...

1186
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,375
They're more like family.

1187
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,210
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1188
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,289
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.

1189
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,165
- They did?
- Yeah.

1190
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,655
I don't want to scare you.

1191
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,004
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1192
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,485
Very loud.

1193
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,655
They are also stubborn at times,

1194
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,935
and a little overbearing.

1195
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,645
And heavy. Really,
really, heavy.

1196
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,095
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1197
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,248
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1198
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,771
Okay, then.

1199
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,289
Meet my family.

1200
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,201
Hey, guys.

1201
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,250
They're rocks.

1202
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,775
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1203
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,531
He's crazy.

1204
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,288
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

1205
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,895
Clay, whoa... I don't
even recognize you.

1206
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,921
You lost so much weight.

1207
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,975
I'll distract him
while you run.

1208
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,923
Hi, Sven's family!

1209
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,601
It's nice to meet you.

1210
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,415
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1211
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,331
I understand you're
love experts. Ooh!

1212
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,290
Why aren't you running?

1213
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,775
Uh...

1214
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,087
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1215
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,244
- Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1216
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,290
Kristoff!

1217
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,244
Whoa!

1218
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,966
Hey!

1219
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,365
Kristoff's home!

1220
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,815
- Kristoff's here!
- Kristoff's home!

1221
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,127
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.

1222
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,775
Ah, let me look at you.

1223
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,455
Take off your
clothes, I wash them.

1224
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,164
No! No, I'm going to
keep my clothes on.

1225
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,775
Look, it's great to see you all,

1226
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,926
but where's Granpabbie?

1227
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,135
He's napping.

1228
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,844
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1229
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,535
- L...
- I earned my fire Crystal.

1230
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,800
I passed a kidney Stone.

1231
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,166
Kristoff, pick me up.

1232
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,575
You're getting big.

1233
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,681
Good for you.

1234
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,368
Trolls. They're trolls!

1235
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,924
He's brought a girl!

1236
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,686
A girl!

1237
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,735
- Whoa!
- Is that a real girl?

1238
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,855
She's like a little cupcake.

1239
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,935
What's going on?

1240
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,086
I've learned to
just roll with it.

1241
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,855
Let me see. Bright
eyes, working nose,

1242
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,211
strong teeth!

1243
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,165
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.

1244
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,495
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

1245
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,895
- No.
- You've got the wrong idea.

1246
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,055
No. That's not why I
brought her here.

1247
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,935
Right. We're not... I'm not...

1248
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,962
What's the issue, dear?

1249
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,295
Why are you holding
back from such a man?

1250
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,129
<i>Is it the clumpy way he walks?</i>

1251
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,629
- <i>What?
- Or the grumpy way he talks?</i>

1252
01:05:47,654 --> 01:05:49,455
- <i>Oh, no.
- Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped.</i>

1253
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,015
<i>Weirdness of his feet?</i>

1254
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,135
Hey!

1255
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,095
<i>And though we know
he washes well.</i>

1256
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,600
<i>He always ends up
sort of smelly.</i>

1257
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,375
<i>But you'll never meet a fella.</i>

1258
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,335
<i>"BOTH". Who's as
sensitive and sweet.</i>

1259
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,455
That's nice, but...

1260
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,403
<i>So, he's a bit of
a fixer-upper.</i>

1261
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,575
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- So, he's got a few flaws.</i>

1262
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,815
<i>"TROLL 1". Like his
peculiar brain, dear.</i>

1263
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,975
<i>TROLL '2'. His thing
with the reindeer.</i>

1264
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,655
<i>That's a little outside
of nature's laws.</i>

1265
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,775
This is not about me!

1266
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,535
<i>So, he's a bit of
a fixer-upper.</i>

1267
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,735
<i>But this we're certain of.</i>

1268
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,375
<i>You can fix this
fixer-upper up.</i>

1269
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,175
- <i>With a little bit of love.
- Um...</i>

1270
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,215
Can we please just stop
talking about this?

1271
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,455
We've got a real,
actual problem, here.

1272
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,881
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

1273
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,335
<i>Is it the way that
he runs scared?</i>

1274
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,249
<i>Or that he's
socially impaired?</i>

1275
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,829
<i>Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?</i>

1276
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:34,975
I did not need to know that.

1277
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,128
<i>Are you holding
back your fondness.</i>

1278
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,571
<i>Due to his unmanly blondness?</i>

1279
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,203
<i>Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?</i>

1280
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,409
<i>He's just a bit
of a fixer-upper.</i>

1281
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,015
<i>He's got a couple of bugs.</i>

1282
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,895
- <i>No, I don't!
- His isolation is confirmation.</i>

1283
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,764
- <i>Of his desperation for healing hugs.
- Aw.</i>

1284
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,455
<i>So, he's a bit of
a fixer-upper.</i>

1285
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,131
<i>But we know what to do.</i>

1286
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,255
<i>The way to fix up
this fixer-upper.</i>

1287
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,815
<i>Is to fix him up with you.</i>

1288
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,330
Whoa!

1289
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,965
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Enough!

1290
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,166
She is engaged to
someone else, okay?

1291
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,055
<i>So, she's a bit
of a fixer-upper.</i>

1292
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,809
<i>That's a minor thing.</i>

1293
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,282
<i>Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement.</i>

1294
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,815
<i>And by the way, I
don't see no ring.</i>

1295
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,095
<i>So, she's a bit
of a fixer-upper.</i>

1296
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,122
- <i>Hey! Whoa, watch it!
- Her brain's a bit betwixt.</i>

1297
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,775
<i>Get the fiance out of the way.</i>

1298
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,161
<i>And the whole thing
will be fixed.</i>

1299
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,808
<i>We're not saying
you can change him</i>

1300
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,849
<i>'Cause people don't
really change.</i>

1301
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,655
<i>We're only saying
that love's a force.</i>

1302
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,015
<i>That's powerful and strange.</i>

1303
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,255
<i>People make bad choices.</i>

1304
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,487
<i>If they're mad or
scared or stressed.</i>

1305
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,775
<i>But throw a little
love their way.</i>

1306
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,135
<i>Throw a little love their way.</i>

1307
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,083
<i>And you'll bring
out their best.</i>

1308
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,488
<i>True love brings out the best.</i>

1309
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,167
<i>Everyone's a bit
of a fixer-upper.</i>

1310
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,295
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

1311
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,375
- Father!
- Sister!

1312
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,175
- <i>Brother!
- We need each other to raise us up.</i>

1313
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,361
<i>And round us out.</i>

1314
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,935
<i>Everyone's a bit
of a fixer-upper.</i>

1315
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,362
<i>But when push comes to shove.</i>

1316
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,735
<i>The only fixer-upper fixer.</i>

1317
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,815
<i>That can fix a
fixer-upper is...</i>

1318
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,162
<i>True, true.</i>

1319
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,375
<i>True.</i>

1320
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,455
<i>Love!</i>

1321
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,815
<i>Love, love, love.</i>

1322
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,815
<i>Love True love.</i>

1323
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,975
<i>True.</i>

1324
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,175
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to
be your trollfully wedded...

1325
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,135
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.

1326
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,295
Love!

1327
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,401
Anna?

1328
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,606
She's as cold as ice.

1329
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,970
There is strange magic here.

1330
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,363
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her here to me.

1331
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,525
Anna, your life is in danger.

1332
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,124
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1333
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,448
If not removed, to solid ice
will you freeze, forever.

1334
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,215
What? No.

1335
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,526
But you can remove it, right?

1336
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,727
I cannot.

1337
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,689
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1338
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,287
If it was her head,
that would be easy.

1339
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,201
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1340
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,655
An act of true love?

1341
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,967
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1342
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,255
Something's wrong.
Are you all right?

1343
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,855
Anna, we've got to get
you back to Hans.

1344
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,975
Hans.

1345
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,001
Pull us out, Sven.

1346
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,166
Olaf, come on!

1347
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,885
I'm coming!

1348
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,163
Let's go kiss Hans!

1349
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,284
Who is this Hans?

1350
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,289
We are here to find
Princess Anna.

1351
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,242
Be on guard, but no harm
is to come to the Queen.

1352
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,855
Do you understand?

1353
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,245
Yes, Your Grace.

1354
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,291
The Queen.

1355
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,368
Go, go! Come on!

1356
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,687
Duke'S THUG 22 There!

1357
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,367
Duke'S THUG 12 Up there!

1358
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,125
Come on!

1359
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,881
We got her.

1360
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,720
No. Please.

1361
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,330
Go around. Toss it.

1362
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,686
Stay away!

1363
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,126
LOOK out!

1364
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,815
Duke'S THUG 21 Fire! Fire!

1365
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,046
Get her!

1366
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,121
Ah!

1367
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,726
Come on!

1368
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,807
Grab his arm.

1369
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,241
Duke'S THUG 22 Aim...

1370
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:47,215
SOLDIER 11 This way, this way!

1371
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,241
SOLDIER 23 Whoa!

1372
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,647
Queen Elsa!

1373
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,561
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.

1374
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,727
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?

1375
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,291
Why did you bring me here?

1376
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,285
I couldn't just let
them kill you.

1377
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,569
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.
Get Anna.

1378
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,122
Anna has not returned.

1379
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,848
If you would just
stop the winter.

1380
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,646
Bring back summer, please.

1381
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,445
Don't you see?

1382
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,080
I can't.

1383
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,081
You have to tell
them to let me go.

1384
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,689
I will do what I can.

1385
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,975
Just hang in there.

1386
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,161
Come on, buddy, faster!

1387
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,335
Oh, boy!

1388
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,362
Whoa! I'll meet you
guys at the castle!

1389
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,975
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1390
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,525
I will!

1391
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,961
- Hello!
- It's alive!

1392
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,525
It's Princess Anna!

1393
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,769
Are you gonna be okay?

1394
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,655
Don't worry about me.

1395
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,495
Anna!

1396
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,415
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1397
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,415
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.

1398
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,851
We will. Thank you.

1399
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,531
Make sure she's safe.

1400
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,655
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1401
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,889
Oh, let's get you inside
now and get you warm.

1402
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,289
I'm going back out to
look for Princess Anna.

1403
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,050
You cannot risk going
out there again.

1404
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:02,575
If anything happens to her...

1405
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,364
If anything happens
to the Princess,

1406
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,927
you are all Arendelle has left.

1407
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,495
He's in here.

1408
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,615
Prince Hans.

1409
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,926
Anna.

1410
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,175
You're so cold.

1411
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,415
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1412
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,135
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.

1413
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,889
We'll give you two some privacy.

1414
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,015
What happened out there?

1415
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,929
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1416
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,655
You said she would
never hurt you.

1417
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,735
I was wrong.

1418
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,125
Anna.

1419
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,490
She froze my heart,

1420
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,166
and only an act of
true love can save me.

1421
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,604
A true love's kiss.

1422
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,960
Oh, Anna.

1423
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,450
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.

1424
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,800
What?

1425
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,084
You said you did.

1426
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,175
As thirteenth in line
in my own kingdom,

1427
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,455
I didn't stand a chance.

1428
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,215
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1429
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,640
What... What are
you talking about?

1430
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,567
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1431
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,729
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1432
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,895
- But you...
- Hans!

1433
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,415
You were so desperate for love,

1434
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,171
you were willing to marry
me just like that.

1435
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,529
I figured after we married,

1436
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,608
I would have to stage a
little accident for Elsa.

1437
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,848
Hans! No. Stop.

1438
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,135
But then, she doomed herself,

1439
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,095
and you were dumb
enough to go after her.

1440
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,215
Please.

1441
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,720
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,

1442
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,771
and bring back summer.

1443
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,415
You're no match for Elsa.

1444
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,647
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1445
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,481
I, on the other hand,

1446
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,529
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1447
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,811
You won't get away with this.

1448
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,407
Oh...

1449
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,611
I already have.

1450
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,124
Please, somebody, help.

1451
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,923
Please. Please.

1452
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,975
It's getting colder
by the minute.

1453
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,695
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1454
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,131
Prince Hans.

1455
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,243
Princess Anna is...

1456
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,215
Dead.

1457
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,295
What?

1458
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,810
What happened to her?

1459
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,250
She was killed.

1460
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,960
By Queen Elsa.

1461
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,127
No!

1462
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,481
Her own sister.

1463
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,767
At least we got to say
our marriage vows

1464
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,082
before she died in my arms.

1465
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,530
There can be no doubt now.

1466
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,375
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1467
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,323
and we are all in grave danger.

1468
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,721
Prince Hans,

1469
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,283
Arendelle looks to you.

1470
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,695
With a heavy heart,

1471
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,691
I charge Queen Elsa of
Arendelle with treason.

1472
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,768
And sentence her to death.

1473
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,281
Hurry up!

1474
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,615
She's dangerous.

1475
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,801
- Move quickly.
- Careful.

1476
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,050
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.

1477
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,486
Put your back into it!

1478
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,210
Come on! Push!

1479
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,535
What is it, buddy?

1480
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,005
Hey, watch it.

1481
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,561
What's wrong with you?

1482
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,082
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1483
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,007
Stop it! Put me down!

1484
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,526
No, Sven!

1485
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,215
We're not going back.

1486
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,730
She's with her true love.

1487
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,721
What the...

1488
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,641
Anna!

1489
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,485
Come on! Come on, boy.

1490
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,681
Help.

1491
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,325
Anna!

1492
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,480
Oh, no.

1493
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,881
Olaf?

1494
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,282
Olaf. Get away from there.

1495
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,961
Wow!

1496
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,807
So, this is heat.

1497
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,251
I love it.

1498
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,010
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1499
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,244
So, where's Hans? What
happened to your kiss?

1500
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,606
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1501
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,525
But we ran all the way here.

1502
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,215
Please, Olaf, you can't
stay here. You'll melt.

1503
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,335
I am not leaving here until

1504
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,931
we find some other act of
true love to save you.

1505
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,169
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1506
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,210
I don't even know what love is.

1507
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,284
That's okay, I do.

1508
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,085
<i>Love 'vs</i>

1509
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,447
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1510
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,011
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1511
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,329
Kristoff loves me?

1512
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,407
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?

1513
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,724
Olaf, you're melting.

1514
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,202
Some people are
worth melting for.

1515
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,442
Just maybe not
right this second.

1516
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,086
Don't worry, I've got it.

1517
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,723
We're gonna get through...
Oh, wait.

1518
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,490
Hang on, I'm getting something.

1519
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,001
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1520
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,366
They're coming back this way.

1521
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,161
They... They are?

1522
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,960
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1523
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,615
I guess I was wrong.

1524
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,040
I guess Kristoff doesn't love
you enough to leave you behind.

1525
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,815
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1526
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,975
No, no, no! You need to stay
by the fire and keep warm.

1527
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,735
I need to get to Kristoff.

1528
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,841
Why?

1529
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,766
Oh, I know Why!

1530
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,135
There's your act of
true love right there!

1531
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,135
Riding across the fjords like a
Valiant, pungent reindeer King!

1532
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,446
Come on!

1533
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,495
Look out!

1534
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,760
<i>"OW.!"</i>

1535
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,170
Uh... Back this way.

1536
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,050
We're trapped.

1537
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,680
On...

1538
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,210
Whoa!

1539
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,930
Slide, Anna!

1540
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,371
We made it!

1541
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,130
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1542
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,370
Come on, buddy, faster.

1543
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,211
Kristoff!

1544
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,445
Keep going!

1545
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,285
Kristoff!

1546
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,967
Come on!

1547
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,367
No.

1548
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,641
Whoa!

1549
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,850
Whoa!

1550
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,810
Sven... Sven!

1551
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,765
Good boy.

1552
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,571
Kristoff.

1553
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,409
- Kristoff...
- Anna...

1554
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,401
Anna!

1555
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,169
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1556
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,489
Just take care of my sister.

1557
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,085
Your sister?

1558
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,726
She returned from the
mountain weak and cold.

1559
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,215
She said that you
froze her heart.

1560
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,241
No.

1561
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,448
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1562
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,241
Her skin was ice. Her
hair turned white.

1563
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,370
Your sister is dead.

1564
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,804
Because of you.

1565
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,047
No.

1566
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,321
Kristoff.

1567
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,250
Anna!

1568
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,205
Elsa?

1569
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,607
No!

1570
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,201
Anna!

1571
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,650
Oh. Anna!

1572
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,602
No, no!

1573
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,245
Please, no.

1574
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,001
Anna?

1575
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,010
Anna?

1576
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,680
Oh, Elsa.

1577
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,207
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1578
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,371
I love you.

1579
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,242
"An act of true love will
thaw a frozen heart."

1580
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,490
"Love Will thaw."

1581
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,415
Love. Of course.

1582
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,521
Elsa?

1583
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,241
Love!

1584
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,491
I knew you could do it.

1585
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,242
Hands down, this is the
best day of my life.

1586
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,735
And, quite possibly, the last.

1587
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,081
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1588
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,050
Oh, Oh, Oh!

1589
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,243
My own personal flurry!

1590
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,570
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1591
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,641
Anna?

1592
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,644
But she froze your heart.

1593
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,571
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1594
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,524
Wonderful!

1595
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,005
Setting course, Sir.

1596
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,647
I will return this
scoundrel to his country.

1597
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,561
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1598
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,455
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1599
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,130
This is unacceptable.

1600
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,324
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1601
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,164
Ah! My neck hurts.

1602
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,928
Is there a doctor
that I could see?

1603
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,415
And I demand to see the Queen!

1604
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,442
Oh. I have a message
from the Queen.

1605
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,895
"Arendelle will
henceforth and forever"

1606
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,845
"no longer do business of
any sort with Weaseltown."

1607
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,215
"Weselton."

1608
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,775
- it's Weselton!
- Let's go.

1609
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,840
Come on, come on, come on!

1610
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,375
Okay, okay, here I come.

1611
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,289
- Pole!
- Whoops! Sorry.

1612
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,011
Okay, Okay-

1613
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,844
Here we are. Oh!

1614
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,163
I owe you a sled.

1615
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,004
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1616
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,975
And it's the latest model.

1617
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,575
No, I can't accept this.

1618
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,365
You have to. No returns. No
exchanges. Queen's orders.

1619
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,321
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1620
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,495
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.

1621
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,015
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1622
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,335
Like it? I love it!

1623
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,415
Whoa.

1624
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,090
I could kiss you!

1625
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,729
I could. I mean, I'd like to.
I'd...

1626
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,928
May I? We me. I mean, may we?

1627
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,127
Wait, what?

1628
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,366
We may.

1629
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,689
Mmm.

1630
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,726
Summer!

1631
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,775
Ooh...

1632
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,802
Hello.

1633
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,444
{CHUCKLING)

1634
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,161
Are you ready?

1635
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,082
Ice!

1636
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,455
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1637
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,925
Swing me.

1638
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,604
Ooh...

1639
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,735
I like the open gates.

1640
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,922
We are never closing them again.

1641
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,927
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1642
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,531
Come on! You can do it!

1643
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,335
Look out. Reindeer
coming through.

1644
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,095
I got it, I got it. I don't
got it, I don't got it.

1645
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,175
Hey, guys!

1646
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,495
That's it, Olaf.

1647
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,815
Glide and pivot. And
glide and pivot.

1648
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,285
Go.

1649
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,201
Oh!

1650
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:58,791
