<i>For most
of human civilization,</i>

8
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,927
<i>we believed that we were
Earth's most dominant species.</i>

9
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,888
<i>We believed that life...</i>

10
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,726
{\an8}<i>...could only exist
on the surface of the planet.</i>

11
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:13,063
{\an8}<i>Well, after a certain point,
you have to wonder</i>

12
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,628
{\an8}what else were we wrong about?

13
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,154
{\an8}We have mapped

14
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,991
{\an8}less than five percent
of Hollow Earth.

15
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,806
{\an8}<i>But our ecosystems
are linked in ways</i>

16
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,340
{\an8}<i>we never could have imagined.</i>

17
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,875
{\an8}We are not
two separate worlds.

18
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,126
{\an8}We're one.

19
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,776
{\an8}<i>Kong is settling in
to Hollow Earth.</i>

20
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,217
{\an8}<i>So, the big guy likes
his new home.</i>

21
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:43,426
{\an8}<i>We think so.</i>

22
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,262
{\an8}<i>His species
was a very social one.</i>

23
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,433
{\an8}<i>It's not natural
for Kong to be so alone.</i>

24
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,020
{\an8}<i>He's the last of his kind.</i>

25
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,772
{\an8}<i>Every day he searches</i>

26
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,524
{\an8}<i>for a family
that he'll never find.</i>

27
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,152
{\an8}<i>What about Godzilla?</i>

28
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,238
{\an8}<i>Godzilla's
on the surface, Kong is below.</i>

29
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,533
{\an8}As long as they don't venture
into each other's territories,

30
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,659
{\an8}we've got nothing
to worry about.

31
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,036
{\an8}<i> Humanity is lucky...</i>

32
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,872
{\an8}<i>Godzilla's fighting
the battles we can't.</i>

33
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,909
<i>With some critics</i>

34
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,410
<i>calling out Monarch</i>

35
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,453
{\an8}<i>for the billions
in taxpayer dollars...</i>

36
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,290
{\an8}<i>going to Hollow Earth
and classified technologies</i>

37
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,127
{\an8}<i>like the mysterious
Project Powerhouse.</i>

38
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,586
<i>Well, here to discuss,</i>

39
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,046
<i>Monarch's own,
Doctor Ilene Andrews.</i>

40
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,799
<i>Let's start with Godzilla.
He stopped the attack in Rome,</i>

41
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,636
{\an8}<i>but he's still in the city.
Should we be worried?</i>

42
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,220
{\an8}<i>It's clear to us now</i>

43
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,243
{\an8}<i>that Godzilla is a Titan
who protects us</i>

44
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:55,360
<i>from other malicious
Titan threats.</i>

45
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:57,274
Kong's heading in
for the night.

46
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,148
Looks like
it was another rough one.

47
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,065
That's the farthest
he's gone yet.

48
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,983
Maybe he was looking
for a date.

49
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,442
Good luck with that.

50
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,154
I hope he's up
for some interspecies romance.

51
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,530
whoa.

52
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,782
<i>Sinkhole detected</i>

53
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,034
<i>in Sector Five.</i>

54
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,620
That's Kong's
hunting ground.

55
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,176
Whoa. It keeps doing that.

56
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,346
More electrical anomalies?

57
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,722
Nah,
I don't think so, man.

58
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,516
I haven't seen anything
like this before.

59
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,310
Well, we should
tell Director Hampton.

60
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,353
I'll type it up.

61
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,272
This whole place
is an anomaly.

62
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,193
It's so weird.

63
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,709
Tell the Italian military
Rome would be flattened

64
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,085
if it weren't for Godzilla.

65
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,878
They can threaten him
all they want.

66
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,090
Just tell them
to find another scapegoat.

67
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,840
Director Hampton, what's up?

68
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,885
Well, Outpost One
is still a nightmare,

69
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,678
and they sent this over.

70
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,597
I thought you might want
to take a look.

71
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,014
Is this from the sensor array?

72
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,079
Yeah, we've been getting
some pretty weird spikes.

73
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,144
I mean, it could just
be regular interference.

74
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,854
- Yeah, but it keeps happening.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,564
We should prep a survey team
just in case.

76
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,065
Okay.

77
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,775
And what about Godzilla?

78
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:32,364
Oh, he's still sleeping.
Like a big angry baby.

79
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:35,241
Let's hope
it stays that way.

80
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>Everyone,</i>

81
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,321
<i>eyes on your own paper,
all right?</i>

82
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,688
Let's make sure
we circle the answers

83
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:57,055
really, really clearly.

84
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,878
Jia!

85
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,310
Your daughter is intelligent,

86
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,790
but she's not engaged.

87
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,270
Her grades are slipping,

88
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,190
she's not interacting
with any of her friends.

89
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,777
And these problems aren't
going away, Doctor Andrews.

90
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:54,529
They've been getting worse.

91
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,114
Okay, I'm sorry.

92
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,201
She's just still adjusting
to our world.

93
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:00,451
I understand that,

94
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,828
but we have
a number of students

95
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,100
who are
culturally displaced and...

96
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,373
Sure, but her culture's
not displaced,

97
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:05,998
she is her culture.

98
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,794
She's the last living member
of the Iwi tribe.

99
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,420
We're just trying
to reach her.

100
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,549
I know. Join the club.

101
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,182
Come on.

102
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,648
<i>For centuries,</i>

103
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,901
<i>the Iwi tribe were
the guardians of Skull Island,</i>

104
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>the ancestral home
of the great Kong.</i>

105
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,405
<i>But when
shifting storm patterns</i>

106
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,345
<i>destroyed the island,
the Iwi were annihilated...</i>

107
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:23,285
<i>...with only a single member</i>

108
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:25,453
<i>of the tribe having survived.</i>

109
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,079
<i>A young girl...</i>

110
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,207
<i>...found and rescued
amid the punishing storm.</i>

111
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,501
<i>Her fellow villagers
were lost to the tides.</i>

112
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,797
<i>Gone to history, just like
the great Kongs themselves.</i>

113
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,381
Holy shit.

114
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,216
<i>The Iwi were unique...</i>

115
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,260
<i>...in the sense that they
had no spoken language.</i>

116
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,305
<i>Many believe
that tribe members developed</i>

117
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:44,723
<i>the ability to communicate...</i>

118
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,783
We're gonna figure this out.

119
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Where will you be

120
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,587
when the next Titan attacks?

121
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,384
How will you protect
the things and people

122
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:03,969
that matter most to you?

123
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,346
Today's podcast
is brought to you

124
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,182
by Gargantua insurance,
the only insurance company

125
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,101
that provides Titan protection
for your home

126
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:12,893
and personal belongings.

127
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,813
'Cause Godzilla may not care
about your hopes and dreams,

128
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:16,647
but Gargantua does.

129
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,775
Okay, Titan truthers!

130
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,777
Oh, we have got a lot...

131
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,570
...to unpack on today's show.

132
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,364
Recording in progress,

133
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,448
go away!

134
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,702
Uh, yes. I just want
to let everyone know

135
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,119
that there is no...

136
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm gonna kill...

137
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,332
Unbelievable! What?

138
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,500
Uh...

139
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,628
Hi, Bernie.

140
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,673
Ilene Andrews,
we met in Hong Kong.

141
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,299
Oh. Oh.

142
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,553
Hong Kong.
Yeah, that was so long ago.

144
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,471
So, no, God, uh, yeah.

145
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,724
That was when
my hair was longer.

146
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,017
You cut your hair.

147
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:53,310
Highlights too, it's nice.

148
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,929
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.

149
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,317
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,319
Uh, sure.

151
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,281
Sure, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Come on in, Doctor Andrews.

152
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,157
- Okay.
- Yeah.

153
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,367
Just straight down
that hall there.

154
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,702
To the left. Okay.

155
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,602
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?

156
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:18,083
You know, <i>mi casa es su</i> home.

157
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,377
Okay, so.
The sequence on the right,

158
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,672
this is a signal
that's been interfering

159
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,840
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.

160
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,507
- Okay.
- And, uh...

161
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,178
And these are drawings
by my daughter, Jia.

162
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,536
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.

163
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,894
No, the patterns are the same
in the middle section.

164
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,771
Yes. Exactly.

165
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,439
Thank you.

166
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,107
Look, our analysts,

167
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,485
they don't know
what to make of this.

168
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,860
They're talking in circles,

169
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,321
they're saying
"radio interference,"

170
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,821
"coincidence," but I...

171
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,011
I know that you think
outside of the box.

172
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:52,202
I didn't know
who else to turn to.

173
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,702
And they sent you
here because...?

174
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,080
No, no one sent me.
I came here on my...

175
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,393
You know,
that's what's ironic.

176
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,706
You know,
Monarch wouldn't confirm

177
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,043
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla,

178
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,835
which cost me thousands of...

179
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,025
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.

180
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,683
Oh, and the trolls...

181
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:07,221
the trolls online,
they question

182
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:08,760
every single thing
that I put up.

183
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,886
Especially this one troll.

184
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,722
This one troll named
ghidorastan64.

185
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,223
You ever heard of him?

186
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,225
- No, I don't think I have.
- Great,

187
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:16,642
because he's a trash bag, okay?

188
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,186
I'm more qualified
than half of those people

189
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,812
that you have working
over there.

190
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,126
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do

191
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,439
before anybody
at Monarch said...

192
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,443
Which is why I am here,
Bernie.

193
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,404
I am here. Okay?

194
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,409
Can you help me or not?

195
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,784
That depends.

196
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,912
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?

197
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:36,913
The what?

198
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,540
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.

199
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,582
The MHES, the Mess.

200
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, nobody calls it that.

201
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,794
I run the Kong
research division

202
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,506
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge

203
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,465
- of general operations.
- Hmm.

204
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,093
Well, Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid

205
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,511
who can talk to Kong.

206
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,266
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.

207
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,102
I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.

208
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,728
I thought you were never
gonna ask

209
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,771
- but I really do need proof.
- No, I'm not asking.

210
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,772
I mean, that would help me
with my bona fides

211
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,275
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person

212
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:06,942
to help me do that.

213
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,236
Okay. Well, if this happens,
and that is a big if,

214
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,695
then Monarch would need,
you know,

215
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,447
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...

216
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,198
{\an8}Whoa. I'm sorry,
final cut? No, no, no.

217
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,577
{\an8}You know, that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.

218
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,453
Shit.

219
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,830
No really true, good
documentarian gives final cut.

220
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:19,872
I could make you a producer.

221
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,499
Okay, okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!

222
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,126
Look, something is happening
to my daughter,

223
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,795
and I have no idea
how to fix it.

224
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,713
You work out what's going on,

225
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,882
and I will get you anything
that you want, okay?

226
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,340
That is a promise.

227
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,467
Well, anything is a lot,

228
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,968
but that's very generous,
but I...

229
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,805
- And we have to go. Right now.
- What?

230
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,682
Godzilla is on the move again.

231
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,614
Okay, listen to me.

232
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,242
If Godzilla's on the move,
he senses a threat coming.

233
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,826
We don't know what it is.

234
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,036
<i>And you're not concerned?</i>

235
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,537
Of course we're concerned,
Senator.

236
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,413
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.

237
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,374
<i>Monitor the fact
that if Godzilla heads...</i>

238
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,916
What is it? You just...

239
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:46,501
- And I am telling you,
- We have a problem!

240
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,793
Senator...

241
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,586
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.

242
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:53,550
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.

243
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,979
- What's he doing up here?
- No idea.

244
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,482
- Well, does Godzilla know?
- Not that we can tell.

245
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,941
Yeah, well, it's only
a matter of time.

246
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,987
And what happens if Godzilla
starts heading this way?

247
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,696
Then we all run like hell.

248
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,656
Get up, let's go!

249
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,157
Keep it up. Come on. Let's go.

250
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,227
Sedatives in place.

251
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,612
<i>All right, the good news is</i>

252
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:57,237
<i>it's just an infected tooth.</i>

253
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,075
But luckily, you've come
to the best doctor in town.

254
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,956
<i>♪ I gotcha ♪</i>

255
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,047
<i>♪ I gotcha ♪</i>

256
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,091
<i>All right,
Kong sedation at a 100%.</i>

257
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,383
<i>Vitals stable.</i>

258
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,052
<i>Trapper, you are clear to swap</i>

259
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,137
<i>the damaged tooth
with replacement.</i>

260
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:26,434
Way-hey!

261
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,229
Touchdown, Trapper.

262
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,493
Whoa. Fella.

263
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,694
What'd you have for breakfast?

264
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,999
All right?

265
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,213
Yeah, this sucker's ready
to come out.

266
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,132
Whoa.

267
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,530
All right, let's roll!

268
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,741
There she is.

269
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,951
Trapper.

270
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,996
Thanks for getting down here
so fast. Nice work.

271
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:30,080
You are most welcome.

272
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,540
It's not every day
you get to climb

273
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,000
inside a 300-foot ape's mouth,
is it?

274
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,378
Yeah. And you're sure it's
gonna be strong enough?

275
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,628
The tooth? Yeah.

276
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,151
That's the same
polymer composite

277
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:39,674
they use on the vehicle
heat shields.

278
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,509
He could chomp through

279
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,802
the Eiffel Tower
with that thing.

280
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,263
Well,
good teeth aren't gonna help

281
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,139
if Godzilla senses
that he's up here.

282
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,518
Well. You can't have a Titan
with a toothache,

283
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,957
can you?

284
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,395
- No.
- Don't worry.

285
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,731
Couple of hours
he might be a bit groggy,

286
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:56,648
but he'll be good to go
back down.

287
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,527
You know, when I first heard that you were
gonna be a vet I thought no.

288
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,069
That is way too boring

289
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,988
for Trapper.

290
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,449
Then you go and become the
weirdest vet in the world.

291
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,617
Yeah, it's basically
me and Doctor Dolittle.

292
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,286
Except my animals are bigger.

293
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,123
I thought finally, someone has
made him grow up.

294
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,542
Nope. Someone tried that
back in college,

295
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,961
- but... didn't really work.
- Oh, yeah?

296
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,587
Yeah,
what was it she said to me?

297
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,840
"Trapper,
you are not a serious person."

298
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,113
Oh, she sounds very smart.

299
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:25,385
Yeah, ish. She got a PhD.

300
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,221
Two, actually.

301
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,766
How's the kid doing?

302
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,560
You know. Struggling.

303
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,147
Trying to find her place
in the world.

304
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,523
Yeah, I know how that goes.

305
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,985
Don't worry,
she'll be all right.

306
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,195
She got a good mum.

307
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:03,424
Doctor Andrews. Your guest
has been asking for you.

308
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,385
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

309
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,136
but can I just say,

310
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,972
that your research library
has many glaring omissions.

311
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,348
I had to call in
some serious favors

312
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,725
from my Discord chat.
They were not...

313
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,142
Bernie, do you have something?

314
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,812
Yes, I've got something.
I do have something.

315
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:17,562
Whatever signal
you guys are picking up,

316
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,961
okay, we have seen similar
patterns repeating over time.

317
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:22,360
And each spike corresponds
with a specific Titan event.

318
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,195
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you so much.

319
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,029
Okay, check this out.

320
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,908
See this? King Ghidorah, huh?
First encounter with Godzilla.

321
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,514
- Mm-hmm.
- Here, uh,

322
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,119
discovery of Skull Island.

323
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,870
All right. So what you're
saying is that these signals

324
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,706
- aren't just random patterns.
- Yeah, it seems that way, yes.

325
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,124
And Godzilla's
picking up on it?

326
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,751
Oh, I can do you one better.
Now, look,

327
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,377
I've looked
at points of similarities

328
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,003
in each wave form
and I compared them

329
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,089
- to that pattern, and...
- Bernie, what are you saying?

330
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,464
It's a distress call!

331
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,113
It's a distress call.
A psychic energy SOS.

332
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:49,835
Now, if your daughter is
seeing these symbols,

333
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:52,557
then something down
there is calling for help.

334
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,102
<i>Regular soundwaves,</i>

335
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,292
they can't propagate this far
without decay. This?

336
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,481
This is something that
we have never encountered.

337
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,985
- And it's getting stronger.
- You got a working theory?

338
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,736
Yeah,
telepathic alien language.

339
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,488
It's some sort of
distress signal.

340
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,907
Signal? From what?

341
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,283
Or from who.

342
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,659
Well, whatever it is,

343
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,202
this is why Godzilla's
on the move?

344
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,413
We can't say for sure.
But it seems that way.

345
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,624
Well, we have
to figure this out fast.

346
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,085
The wolves are already
at our door.

347
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,588
The government has been
looking for an excuse

348
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,380
to take over
Hollow Earth operations.

349
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,633
And the corporations
are licking their chops.

350
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,364
Yeah,
because who wants to be rich

351
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:31,105
and get rid
of all the monsters?

352
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,846
I mean, that'd be terrible, right?

353
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,128
We'd better find the source
before D.C. gets wind of this.

354
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,852
Okay.

355
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,334
I'm giving you
full operational oversight.

356
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:43,816
Take a small team.
Mikael, make it fast

357
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,442
and don't let anyone die.

358
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,612
We'll be in and out of there
before nightfall.

359
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,947
You, uh, you feel like
going for a ride?

360
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,200
Thought you'd never ask.

361
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,747
<i>Attention, all hands.</i>

362
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,541
<i>Prepare HEAV three
for Hollow Earth launch</i>

363
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,293
<i>in T minus five minutes.</i>

364
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,588
There's no response
from the Hollow Earth outpost.

365
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,880
Their radios must be down.

366
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,424
Well, then
that's our first stop.

367
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,635
Copy that.

368
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,785
All right, wakey wakey,
everyone. Kong's up.

369
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,934
Hey. Hey! Doctor Andrews. Hey.
Come on, we had a deal!

370
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,268
Bernie, this isn't sightseeing.

371
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,145
It's a reconnaissance mission.

372
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,021
So, I see how it is.

373
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,773
When you need something,
it's all

374
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,359
"you're so smart, Bernie,
you're so capable, Bernie,

375
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,778
"I'll subscribe
to your Titan blog, Bernie,"

376
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,197
and when I deliver it,
you toss me aside.

377
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,825
Okay, look.
This could be dangerous.

378
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,325
Come on.

379
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm no stranger to danger.

380
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,623
I didn't mean to rhyme
that time.

381
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,397
Look, you owe me. Okay?
I helped crack this thing.

382
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:29,171
This could be like last time,
when we saved the world.

383
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,423
Remember? Hmm?

384
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,343
- Mikael?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,636
Prep a seat for one more.

386
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,556
Thank you, Doctor Andrews!
You will not regret it.

387
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:40,057
You're kidding, right?

388
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,019
I'm the plus one. Hello.

389
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,397
<i>Systems online.</i>

390
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,233
Whoa. Oh. Whoa.

391
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,109
We're online.

392
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,050
We are going to Hollow Earth.

393
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:56,584
I am going to Hollow Earth.

394
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:59,117
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

395
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,765
So, is there, like,
a in-flight briefing

396
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,413
that I should know about?
You know...

397
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,872
- Yeah, there is.
- He's very...

398
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,459
There's no parachutes,
no flotation devices,

399
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,959
you touch any of this stuff,

400
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,815
you lose your hand,
and if you die,

401
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:11,672
make sure
it's outside my vehicle.

402
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,406
Good briefing. Great briefing.

403
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,898
Don't take Mikael
too personally.

404
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:21,390
Aggression is
his love language.

405
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,523
All right, Mikael.
Let's punch it.

406
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,950
<i>HEAV one,</i>

407
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,160
<i>you are clear for launch.</i>

408
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,869
Let's do this.

409
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,216
Just try not
to swallow your tongue.

410
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,030
What?
Try not to swallow my tongue?

411
00:27:58,031 --> 00:27:59,845
I don't exactly know
what that means.

412
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,266
<i>Base to HEAV,</i>

413
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,872
<i>you're clear for entry.</i>

414
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,477
<i>On your count,</i>

415
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,645
<i>- Doctor Andrews.</i>
- Three.

416
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:09,730
- All right, let's go.
- Two.

417
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,064
I'm not ready.

418
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,901
- And one.
- Oh, my God!

419
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:43,055
I'm turning into water.

420
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,370
<i>Flight systems active.</i>

421
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,163
<i>Systems stabilized.</i>

422
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,415
All systems good,

423
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,791
- Doc.
- How's everyone doing?

424
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,875
You all right?

425
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,419
- Never better.
- Yeah?

426
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,962
Bernie, you good?

427
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,927
- Nice one. Oh, wow.
- Whew.

428
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,366
Looks like
Kong is headed home.

429
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,286
- How far to the outpost?
- Hundred klicks.

430
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:48,787
They're still
not answering comms.

431
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,916
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

432
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,294
Predators,
nine o'clock.

433
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,961
Where? What?

434
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:57,672
Those are vertacines, Mikael.

435
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:58,755
They're called vertacines.

436
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,465
Um, are they a problem?

437
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,175
No.
They're totally harmless.

438
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,864
Unless you get 'em riled up,
and then they pack

439
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,705
about a lightning bolt
worth of bioelectricity.

440
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,059
Predators know
to stay well away.

441
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,770
Which makes them
the perfect chaperone

442
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:17,608
if you happen to have
a cool biomimicry camouflage.

443
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:18,859
Which we do.

444
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,376
- Talk to me.
- It's not good.

445
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,503
Godzilla just made landfall
in France.

446
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,171
Ground team
is five klicks out.

447
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,522
We got picture.

448
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,234
Oh, my God.
It's a nuclear facility.

449
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,260
Atmospheric radiation levels

450
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,824

He's absorbing it.

451
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:29,388
Okay, he's charging
for something.

<i>Godzilla consumed</i>

453
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,885
<i>a huge amount of radiation.</i>

<i>He is clearly preparing

455
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,890
<i>Out of range.</i>

456
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:13,973
Damn it.

457
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,477
We're coming up
on Outpost One.

458
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,278
Oh, God.

459
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,865
Oh, well, now. That doesn't
look good now, does it?

460
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,804
You seeing this, Doc?

461
00:32:31,805 --> 00:32:33,744
Yeah. Yeah, I'm seeing it.

462
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,651
Well, there's
no heat signatures.

463
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,443
So much for survivors.

464
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,989
God, have some respect.
These people had families.

465
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,658
What could have done this?

466
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,118
I don't understand,

467
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,912
we've had this outpost
for years without incident.

468
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,790
So, why attack now?
What changed?

469
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,797
Hey, Doc.
There's a camera here.

470
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,843
You reckon you can pull
any footage off of that?

471
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,970
Oh, shit.

472
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,810
You think Kong did that?

473
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:44,314
No, that's not Kong.
That's something else.

474
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:46,858
Yeah.
Let's get off the ground

475
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,861
before that something else
comes back.

476
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,363
Saddle up.
Let's hustle.

477
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,712
Are you getting
anything off that thing?

478
00:38:58,713 --> 00:38:59,963
Yeah, I'm just...

479
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,717
Oh, my God.

480
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:04,968
What?

481
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,304
Here. Take a look.

482
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,266
It looks like an ape.
But that's impossible.

483
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,602
What the bloody hell is that?

484
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,187
I have no idea.

485
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,982
- Whoa! No!
- Whoa.

486
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,109
Mikael! Mikael!

487
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,402
I'm working on it!

488
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,694
Come on, you...

489
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,529
God!
Okay, okay, okay!

490
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,077
The hell was that, Mikael?

491
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:30,994
Calm down. Calm down.

492
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,667
It must've been the signal.
The same electrical

493
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,348
disturbances were
happening at the outpost.

494
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,116
Oh, come on. Come on.

495
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,216
She says it's coming
from that ridge point.

496
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,430
Well, let's take a look.

497
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,933
I'll get as close as I can.

498
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,867
The Hollow Earth.

499
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,371
A world untouched by mankind.

500
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,124
Is this
how Neil Armstrong felt

501
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,877
when he stepped on alien soil?

502
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,465
<i>Is this one small step for me,</i>

503
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,632
<i>and one giant leap for...</i>

504
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,925
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

505
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,218
Are you kidding me?

506
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,303
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.

507
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,264
You wanna be natural.
Just walk, if you just walk.

508
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,183
<i>- All right, just keep...
- Yeah, just... Okay. Take two.</i>

509
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:41,564
The Hollow Earth. A world...

510
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,775
All right, guys.
That ridge you pointed out

511
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,735
is about two miles
straight ahead.

512
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,658
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.

513
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:57,038
Oh, look at that.
I must be tasty too.

514
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,207
Kill it.

515
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,044
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.

516
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,504
So they can grow their eggs.

517
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,258
She needs it more than me.

518
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,858
Wait.

519
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,570
- What?
- What's the holdup?

520
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:30,238
Not this way.

521
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,906
What? Why?

522
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,450
Yeah, we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.

523
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,660
Where, here? Like here, here?

524
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,953
Hey.

525
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,643
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.

526
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:41,333
No. Something
doesn't smell right,

527
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:42,791
and it's not just you, Mikael.

528
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,087
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.

529
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,714
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.

530
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,341
- We keep moving.
- Mikael, hold up.

531
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,133
Listen, pal. I'm gonna trust

532
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,532
my state of the art thermal
over your

533
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,931
Ace Ventura
hippie-dippie sixth sense

534
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:57,973
all day long. You got me?

535
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,267
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...

536
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,018
Hey. And as for you,
freak show,

537
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,063
if you don't shut it,
I'm gonna take that camera,

538
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:04,481
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.

539
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:05,856
I'm in charge, we move.

540
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,275
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?

541
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,589
I said I'm in charge.

542
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,902
I'm in charge!

543
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,655
Whoa!

544
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,511
Run!

545
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,788
It was a tree.
It was a tree!

546
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,413
Wait, wait, wait.

547
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,332
We should be all right.
We should be all right.

548
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,125
Those things
don't reach that far.

549
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,709
He was just eaten by a tree.

550
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,399
What you doing, Doc?

551
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,911
I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.

552
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:30,423
It's just, one minute
he was there, right?

553
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:31,549
He was right in my face.
And then, a tree!

554
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,510
- Outta nowhere!
- I know, man.

555
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:33,801
I know. That's heavy.

556
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:34,720
But that's
the natural world, man.

557
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:36,053
"Red in tooth and claw."

558
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,118
Tennyson.
You just watched a man

559
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:40,182
get devoured
by a topiary nightmare,

560
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,852
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?

561
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:45,188
Yeah. Yeah, man.
He knew all about it.

562
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:47,524
"Let love clasp grief," man.
Come here.

563
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,857
Mm.

564
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,151
You know, humans,
we think we took

565
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,403
ourselves off the food chain,

566
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:57,117
but maybe, maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.

567
00:42:58,535 --> 00:42:59,577
I think that
there is something

568
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,121
seriously wrong with you.

569
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,664
- Okay.
- Mm-kay.

570
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,124
- Okay.
- Mm.

571
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,210
It's not working.

572
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:10,213
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.

573
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,048
Jia. Come on.

574
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,467
- Come on, bud.
- But the...

575
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,719
He was eaten by a tree.

576
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,680
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.

577
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:19,806
Not by a tree.

578
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,858
<i>Tower,</i>

579
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,067
<i>we can't get
any closer than this.</i>

580
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,696
<i>Godzilla's burning hot
with radiation.</i>

581
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,158
<i>Whatever he's headed for
has him really pissed off.</i>

582
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,815
<i>This is Base</i>

583
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:52,130
<i>calling Fifteen Alpha, over.</i>

584
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:55,883
Fifteen Alpha responding.

585
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,509
Godzilla's current trajectory
is showing

586
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,179
<i>him heading
towards the Arctic Ocean.</i>

587
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,264
What Titans are in the area?

588
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,394
<i>Looks like
he's hunting Tiamat.</i>

589
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,481
<i>Classified file three two four.</i>

590
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:11,106
<i>Titanus Tiamat.</i>

591
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,608
<i>Titan nineteen.</i>

592
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,486
<i>Extremely aggressive,
territorial.</i>

593
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,530
{\an8}<i>Weaponizing her body
of razor-sharp scales...</i>

594
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,116
{\an8}<i>Tiamat's Arctic lair
sits in the direct path</i>

595
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,660
{\an8}<i>of electromagnetically charged
solar winds,</i>

596
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,624
{\an8}<i>making it the largest
stockpile of energy on Earth.</i>

597
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:31,002
If Godzilla takes down Tiamat,
he'll supercharge.

598
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,596
It's ruins.

599
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,390
Human civilization?

600
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,392
Down here?

601
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,230
Hey.

602
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,152
Yeah.

603
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,967
The markings are older
than the ones

604
00:44:58,968 --> 00:45:00,782
on Skull Island.
Centuries older.

605
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,330
But the architecture is
consistent with the Iwi.

606
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,433
Whoa.

607
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,156
Oh, this is remarkable.

608
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,292
Now, that's weird.

609
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,295
There's no moss on these ones.

610
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,470
Hello.

611
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,559
Mothra.

612
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,812
Queen of the monsters.
In Hollow Earth.

613
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,316
Her lineage must go
back further than we thought.

614
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:25,824
Yeah.

615
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,887
No, no, no.

616
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,057
What is that? Whoa!

617
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,237
Hey!

618
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,718
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

619
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:11,704
It's like some kind of
a irrigation system.

620
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,435
Only this predates everything

621
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:15,165
Mesopotamians,
the Lemurians...

622
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,460
I mean, these guys
were the first, man!

623
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,923
- Jia.
- It just keeps going.

624
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:24,112
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Oh. Sorry.

625
00:47:24,113 --> 00:47:26,302
Oh, whoa.
What the...?

626
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,930
Now, that is a trip.

627
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,724
Great Mulder and Scully,
look at that.

628
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,561
What could have created this?

629
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:37,355
<i>Ancient alien astronauts.</i>

630
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:38,689
Yeah.

631
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,506
Look at this here.

632
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,904
The water's
running underneath.

633
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,864
And this is organic.

634
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,498
Yeah.

635
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,045
Some kind of bioelectric hub.

636
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,639
It's like camouflage.

637
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,849
Wow.

638
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,272
Should she be doing that?

639
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,233
She shouldn't be doing that,
right? Should she...?

640
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,379
This must be
the source of the signal.

641
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,922
Oh, we've gotta
check this out.

642
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,257
Yeah.

643
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,180
Okay. Go, go, go. Go.

644
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,709
<i>Fifteen Alpha reporting to base.</i>

645
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,170
<i>We're entering
Tiamat's domain,</i>

646
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:36,087
but something is off.

647
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,048
Tiamat's energy
is distorting our radar.

648
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,009
<i>We don't have a visual
on Godzilla.</i>

649
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,304
Take us forward,
silent running...

650
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:44,388
- Yes, sir.
- ...five knots.

651
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,213
- Mayday!
- Get that out!

652
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,415
Get that out!

653
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,126
I need a status report!

654
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:56,376
That's right.

655
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,897
He's gone to Tiamat's lair.

656
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,811
Wait, wait, wait.

657
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:21,964
Wait, what did she say?

658
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:23,361
She says we're not alone.

659
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,489
See? I knew it.
I knew I felt something.

660
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
Come on, then.

661
00:55:35,478 --> 00:55:37,625
Go.

662
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,586
Oh, my God.

663
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,013
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

664
00:55:41,014 --> 00:55:42,534
It's going away.
It's going away. Okay.

665
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,951
Oh, my God.

666
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,244
Oh, my God.

667
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,629
What?

668
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,653
It's an entire
Iwi civilization,

669
00:56:25,654 --> 00:56:27,426
protected within Hollow Earth.

670
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,138
These structures,
they look like they've been

671
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,224
carved from
some enormous quartz crystal.

672
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:35,267
That must be
their energy source.

673
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:36,684
I'm feeling the energy,

674
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,854
but let's just keep it
together, all right?

675
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,471
Oh, my God.
It's an undocumented vortex.

676
00:56:52,472 --> 00:56:55,704
Looks like several of them, actually.

677
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:56,996
Routes to the surface.

678
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,207
These could lead
all over the Earth.

679
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,418
Oh, wow.
That's incredible.

680
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:05,756
You should make
eye contact with them.

681
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:07,987
It's considered polite.

682
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,346
Yeah, this is not
working for me.

683
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,892
Oh.

684
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,666
How are they communicating?

685
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,001
Telepathically.

686
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,095
Okay. No, I, no,
no, no. You can't take her.

687
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:54,513
I think she's taking her
to the...

688
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:55,930
Well, let me come!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

689
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:56,557
Hold on, okay,
we're not resisting.

690
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:57,932
Wait, wait, wait.

691
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,852
I don't know where
she's taking her! Hey!

692
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:08,569
Okay.

693
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,181
- Okay, come on. Okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

694
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,721
Whoa. Oh.

695
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,398
Can I?

696
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,525
Thank you.

697
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:34,153
Of course.

698
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,434
What's she saying, Doc?

699
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,660
The beacon that we've been
following, it's...

700
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:44,747
It's the Iwi calling for help.

701
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:48,294
Oh. Whoa.

702
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,972
So, wait. They send out
this SOS, and then what?

703
00:59:59,973 --> 01:00:01,389
Godzilla hears it?

704
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,850
Yeah. They woke him up.

705
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,185
An SOS for what?
They already live

706
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:06,728
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.

707
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:08,271
What could possibly
scare them?

708
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,065
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.

709
01:00:10,066 --> 01:00:12,171
- She understands me?
- Oh, good.

710
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:14,277
And a nightmare
monster hellscape

711
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:17,364
is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

712
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,131
Oh, wow.

713
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:19,885
This whole room
is covered in Iwi script.

714
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,683
It says that in the beginning,

715
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,647
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.

716
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:35,024
The Titans were
the guardians of nature

717
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,821
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.

718
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,910
But a great evil
threatened the peace.

719
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:48,204
A powerful and ruthless ape

720
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,623
desperate to conquer
the surface world,

721
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:54,628
led his tribe into war
against the one they call...

722
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:57,172
The Monster Who Ate a Star.

723
01:01:57,173 --> 01:01:59,132
Godzilla.

724
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,758
There's more.

725
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,470
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.

726
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:05,076
But after a great battle,

727
01:02:05,077 --> 01:02:06,681
he imprisoned the apes

728
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,038
in a fiery realm
of Hollow Earth.

729
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,395
Their false king
remains obsessed

730
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:13,062
with reaching the surface.

731
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,483
The Iwi call him
the Skar King.

732
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:04,826
<i>Trapped within
their subterranean realm,</i>

733
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:07,329
<i>the Skar King harnessed
a terrible power.</i>

734
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,748
<i>The ancient Titan, Shimo.</i>

735
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,212
He controls her
with pain.

736
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,674
Her power covered the Earth
in the last ice age.

737
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,677
We brought Kong down here.

738
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,347
He's been looking
for others like himself,

739
01:10:25,348 --> 01:10:27,181
going deeper
into Hollow Earth

740
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:29,308
and getting closer
to their prison.

741
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,686
The Iwi must have known
it was just a matter of time,

742
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:33,354
and that's why they've been

743
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,733
calling for help, and that's
why Godzilla's changing.

744
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:38,526
He's gearing up
for World War Three.

745
01:10:38,527 --> 01:10:40,236
Okay, but he barely survived
last time.

746
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:41,947
What's Godzilla
gonna do on his own?

747
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,909
He won't be on his own.

748
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,788
The Iwi believe
that at the end of the world,

749
01:10:49,789 --> 01:10:52,456
one of their own
will return...

750
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:55,794
and awaken Mothra,
defender of the Iwi...

751
01:10:55,795 --> 01:10:58,545
and ancient ally of Godzilla.

752
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,757
They believe
that their savior will be

753
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:02,550
an Iwi from Skull Island.

754
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,847
That seems like a lot
to put on one kid.

755
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,149
<i>This is
Monarch Air Team to Base,</i>

756
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,109
<i>tracking over
Godzilla's location.</i>

757
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,070
<i>We've closed the shipping lanes
within 300 miles.</i>

758
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:32,117
<i>Plasma readings indicate he's
absorbing everything in there.</i>

759
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,551
You know, I made
a deal with myself

760
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:51,468
when I became a mother.

761
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:55,098
I said to myself, "I don't care
what you have to sacrifice...

762
01:13:55,099 --> 01:13:58,267
what you have to give up,

763
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,436
you will do right
by that little girl."

764
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,149
I just never thought that

765
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,861
the thing I'd be giving up
would be her.

766
01:14:07,862 --> 01:14:09,487
Look, you don't know that.

767
01:14:09,488 --> 01:14:10,779
Really?

768
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,156
Trapper, before we came here

769
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:15,285
she said that
she didn't belong anywhere.

770
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:18,580
If this is the life
that she wants,

771
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:20,206
then I have to give her up.

772
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,176
Am I having
a funny turn

773
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,511
or does everything feel
lighter down here?

774
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,764
Wait, wait, wait.

775
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:42,103
What are they doing?
That must weigh a ton.

776
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:43,520
Yeah. Yeah, see,

777
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,355
I don't know
how they can do it...

778
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,192
but somehow they're able to
move the pyramids' positions,

779
01:14:47,193 --> 01:14:48,400
which disrupts the

780
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,235
gravitational pull
down here,

781
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,322
and that's how
they run their city.

782
01:14:52,323 --> 01:14:53,989
<i>An entire civilization</i>

783
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,116
<i>built off the manipulation
of gravity.</i>

784
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,931
God, I wish
was streaming this live!

785
01:14:57,932 --> 01:14:59,746
What you gonna do
with that, Bern?

786
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:03,457
Look, I know
what you're thinking,

787
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:05,459
but you don't understand.
Okay?

788
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,836
To have been through
what I've been through,

789
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:08,295
seen what I seen

790
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:09,923
and have absolutely
nobody believe you.

791
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,259
This place...

792
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,866
This place is special, man.
It's magic.

793
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:19,474
How long do you think
it'll stay like that

794
01:15:19,475 --> 01:15:21,934
if you start posting that
about, hmm?

795
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:25,647
Like, you look at any isolated
tribe or community,

796
01:15:25,648 --> 01:15:27,105
how many of them

797
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,826
survive contact with
the outside world, hmm?

798
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,905
You know I think
you're brilliant, don't you?

799
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:35,573
You already saved
the world once.

800
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:37,242
Can't take that away from you.

801
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:41,078
Could you say that all again?

802
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,164
The last part,
so I have it on footage.

803
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,414
What?

804
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:49,545
<i>Oh, well, we have to find out
what that was, right?</i>

805
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,251
Oh, my God.

806
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:38,261
Is that a mini-Kong?

807
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:41,723
How did they find this place?

808
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:43,558
He must have sensed Jia.

809
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:41,260
That arm looks bad.

810
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:43,409
Yeah. That's worse than bad.

811
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:44,785
That's frostbite.

812
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,875
I'd better go take a look.

813
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,467
<i>Warning,
detecting altered energy signature.</i>

814
01:19:22,468 --> 01:19:25,303
Oh, my God.
He's changed.

815
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:34,812
I know, I know.
Nobody likes a dentist.

816
01:19:36,481 --> 01:19:38,983
Let's get a look
at that arm, big guy.

817
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,112
Trapper, he looks really hurt.

818
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,700
Yeah, it's not great.
I'm seeing nerve damage...

819
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:50,118
<i>significant tissue loss.</i>

820
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,953
<i>So, what are we saying?</i>

821
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,957
He's not gonna last a day down
here with only one arm.

822
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,793
Yeah, communication
to the surface is still out.

823
01:19:57,794 --> 01:19:59,128
If I can get back
to the outpost,

824
01:19:59,129 --> 01:20:00,463
I think there might be
some supplies

825
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:02,339
<i>that we can use.</i>

826
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,758
I don't think a massive cast
is gonna solve the problem.

827
01:20:03,759 --> 01:20:06,676
I wasn't talkin'
plaster of Paris.

828
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,596
<i>I'm thinking
more along the lines of, uh...</i>

829
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,098
Project Powerhouse.

830
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,112
You can't be serious?

831
01:20:15,113 --> 01:20:16,895
Oh, I'm deadly serious.

832
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,523
That prototype
was almost finished

833
01:20:18,524 --> 01:20:20,232
when they pulled the funding.

834
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:22,193
All right, well, what are you
still doing here?

835
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,528
I love you, too, Doc.

836
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:27,615
Project Powerhouse, what is...
what is that, exactly?

837
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,160
<i>After Mechagodzilla,</i>

838
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,204
<i>we realized that there were
some threats that</i>

839
01:20:33,205 --> 01:20:34,788
<i>even Kong couldn't face.</i>

840
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:39,669
So, we started working on some
minor augmentations.

841
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,045
Oh.

842
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,923
Wait, what kind of
augmentations?

843
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:48,719
<i>Making one of
the strongest Titans</i>

844
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,471
<i>even stronger
didn't go over so well.</i>

845
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:51,889
<i>So, we got shut down.</i>

846
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,394
<i>Lucky for us, the prototype</i>

847
01:20:57,395 --> 01:21:00,606
<i>had already been transported
to Hollow Earth for testing.</i>

848
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:04,443
<i>It's stored in the armory
at Outpost One.</i>

849
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:23,670
<i>♪ Tonight, I want

850
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,464

01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:32,554
<i>♪ There's so much

854
01:21:41,481 --> 01:21:42,857
Woo-hoo!

855
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,109
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

856
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,362
That's one hell of an
augmentation there, Trapper.

857
01:21:48,363 --> 01:21:50,906
<i>Only the best for Mr. Kong.</i>

858
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:16,432
All right, it's ready to go.

859
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,354
Those injections should heal
the frostbite up nicely.

860
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,032
All right, there he goes.

861
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:34,367
He's moving.

862
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:39,664
You got this.

863
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,633
Look, it's a bit rough
and ready, but it should hold.

864
01:22:50,634 --> 01:22:51,759
It's good.
It looks good, Trapper.

865
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,259
Damn good.

866
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,373
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

867
01:23:02,374 --> 01:23:03,937
He's either gonna love it

868
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,564
or he's gonna rip it off
with his teeth.

869
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:15,324
I think
he loves it! Yeah?

870
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,723
Skar King.

871
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:46,939
Hey, hey!
What did you tell him?

872
01:23:48,858 --> 01:23:51,776
Oh.

873
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,528
Where's he going?

874
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,781
Godzilla won't come down here
unless Kong brings him.

875
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:57,158
Okay, the last time
those two met up

876
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:58,950
it was almost the end of Kong.

877
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,536
He is taking a hell of a risk.

878
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,541
If Kong invades his turf,
could start a war.

879
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:08,376
Yeah, that's
a suicide mission.

880
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,816
But if Kong draws Godzilla
down here...

881
01:24:10,817 --> 01:24:13,257
they can make their stand
in Hollow Earth

882
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:15,008
and then there's
a chance that

883
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:17,219
Godzilla can stop
Skar King and Shimo

884
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,471
from reaching the surface.

885
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:20,967
We are absolutely certain

886
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:23,053
that she can pull this off, right?

887
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:25,138
It's why Jia was called here.

888
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:28,851
Only an Iwi from Skull Island
can awaken Mothra.

889
01:26:28,852 --> 01:26:31,103
And Mothra is the key
to Godzilla

890
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:32,437
protecting this place,

891
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:34,523
and its pathways
to the surface.

892
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,001
She's gonna be all right.

893
01:26:44,002 --> 01:26:45,442
- Uh-huh.
- She's gonna be all right.

894
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,846
Hey, she's evacuating
the villagers.

895
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:53,852
Gravity! Gravity!
The pyramids and gravity.

896
01:27:53,853 --> 01:27:55,353
Yeah, I got it! I got it now!

897
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:56,814
- Tell me on the way.
- Come on, come on!

898
01:27:56,815 --> 01:27:58,898
While we are throwing
random shit at the wall,

899
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,111
permission to take the HEAV?
Rally some reinforcements.

900
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:04,342
To the surface?
No, there's no time.

901
01:28:04,343 --> 01:28:06,573
No, this idea's
way weirder than that.

902
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,951
All right,
we're underneath the pyramids.

903
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:39,160
Now what?

904
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,954
Gravity.

905
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:42,164
Iwi technology.

906
01:31:56,428 --> 01:32:00,057
With the chemical reaction, this liquid metal
becomes an engineering mechanism

907
01:32:00,058 --> 01:32:02,141
forcing the two
electromagnetic pyramids

908
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:04,727
together, causing
an anti-gravity shock wave.

909
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:07,313
But only for a few minutes.
Or maybe less.

910
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:09,857
Which should keep those
things from the portals.

911
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:12,986
After that, everything that is up
will come crashing down.

912
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,257
They're here.

913
01:32:58,031 --> 01:32:59,491
We're not gonna make it.
There's not enough time.

914
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:00,659
We need something
to slow them down.

915
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,244
Yeah, but what else can we do?

916
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,039
<i>It's vertacine mating season.</i>

917
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:10,459
No way.

918
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,714

919

I'm gonna kiss you
on the mouth!

922
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,149
Come on. Go, go.

923
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:37,029
Buckle up,
you beautiful people.

924
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:39,113
Up and away. Yes!

925
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,742

<i>No! The engine's out.</i>

928
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:43,512
The gravity surge
must have taken out

929
01:34:43,513 --> 01:34:45,389
the power-battery-thing.

930
01:35:22,176 --> 01:35:24,135
Yes! Yes!

931
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:25,762
She's protecting the portals.

932
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,710
Oh, God!

933
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:50,639
Oh.

934
01:43:41,925 --> 01:43:43,051
Look.

935
01:43:44,761 --> 01:43:47,096

936
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,616

937
01:44:37,522 --> 01:44:38,523
