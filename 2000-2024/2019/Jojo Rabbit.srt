1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,241
Jojo Betzler.

2
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,619
Ten years old.

3
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,290
Today, you join the ranks of the <i>Jungvolk</i>

4
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,878
in a very special training weekend.

5
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,138
It's going to be intense.

6
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,643
But today, you become a man.

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,558
I swear to devote
all my energies and my strength

8
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,190
to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler.

9
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,241
I am willing and ready
to give up my life for him.

10
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,869
80 help me God.

11
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,787
Yes, that's right.

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,741
- Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?
- Snake mind.

13
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,919
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your body?
- Wolf body.

14
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,543
- Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?
- Panther courage.

15
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,797
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?
- A German soul.

16
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,377
Yeah, man. You're ready.

17
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,089
- Adolf.
- Hmm?

18
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,684
I don't think I can do this.

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,353
<i>Was?</i> Of course you can.

20
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,474
Sure, you're a little bit scrawny
and a bit unpopular

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,902
and you can't tie your Shoelaces
even though you're ten years old.

22
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:57,733
But you're still the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met.

23
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,692
Not to mention the fact
you're really good looking.

24
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,367
So, you're gonna get out there
and you're gonna have a great time, okay?

25
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,540
- Okay.
- That's the spirit. Okay.

26
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,742
<i>Heil me,</i> man.

27
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,701
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

28
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,538
What? You can <i>heil</i> me better than that.

29
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,963
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- No...

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,916
Just throw it away.
Don't even think about it.

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,047
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- No, you're overthinking it.

32
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,844
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> "Hitterler."

33
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,388
Who's "Hitterler?"
Do you even speak German?

34
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,263
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- That's not a <i>heil.</i> This is a <i>heil. Heil!</i>

35
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,435
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler. <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

36
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,137
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

37
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,188
Ooh, that's it.
You've got it. <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

38
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,811
- Have a great day! <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

39
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,438
- You're gonna be the best. <i>Heil</i> Hitler!
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler! <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

40
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,643
- You can do it.

<i>Heil</i> Hitler, guys.

<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

69
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,436
<i>Jungvolk,</i> welcome to
the <i>Hitlerjugend</i> training weekend.

70
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,818
In which we will make men
and women of you all.

71
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,150
My name is Captain Klenzendorf.

72
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,614
You may call me Captain K.

73
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,945
Captain K. Whoo!

74
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,285
Ja. And this is Sub-Officer Finkel.

75
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,834
This is <i>Fräulein</i> Rahm.

76
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,253
Hey. <i>Heil</i> Hitler, everyone.

77
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,540
So a little about me. Who am I?

78
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,342
And why am I here talking to a bunch
of little titty-grabbers

79
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,136
instead of leading my men
into battle towards glorious death?

80
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,509
Great question.

81
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,137
I've asked it myself every day
since Operation Screw Up

82
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,017
where I lost a perfectly good eye
in a totally preventable enemy attack.

83
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,222
And according to my superiors,

84
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,184
you need two eyes to be
a meaningful part of the war effort.

85
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,482
Can two-eyed people do this?

86
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,039
- Jesus.
- Over the next two days,

87
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,493
you little critters will get to experience
some of the things

88
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,375
that the mighty German army
goes through every day.

89
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,373
And even though it would appear
our country's on the back foot

90
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,210
and there really isn't much hope
in us winning this war,

91
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,794
apparently we're doing just fine.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,145
Anyway. You boys have all been issued
with your <i>Deutsches Jungvolk</i> daggers.

93
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,519
These are very special
and expensive weapons.

94
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,941
You should never be without them.

95
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,735
And don't try to stab each other.

96
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,812
No stabbing!

97
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,942
No stabbing.

98
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,491
This is your first step towards being men.

99
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,532
Today you boys will be involved
in such activities

100
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,034
as marching, bayonet drills,
grenade-throwing,

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,241
trench-digging, map-reading, gas defense,

102
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,121
camouflage, ambush techniques,

103
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,704
war games, firing guns,
and blowing stuff up.

104
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,417
The girls will practice
important womanly duties

105
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,299
such as dressing wounds, making beds,

106
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,097
and learning how to get pregnant.

107
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,173
Aw.

108
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,600
I've had 18 kids for Germany.

109
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,933
Such a great year to be a girl.

110
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,266
All right. Let's get to it.

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,475
Come on.

112
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,607
Go!

113
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,448

131
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,040

a Jewish man mated with a fish.

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,335
Whoa!

133
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,663
We, Aryans, are one thousand times

134
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,126
more civilized and advanced
than any other race.

135
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,461
Now, get your things together, kids.

136
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,296
It's time to burn some books.

137
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,507

Jews sound scary, huh?

149
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,806
Not to me.

150
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,974
If I met one, I'd kill it like that.

151
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,976
Like... that.

152
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,977
But how would you know if you saw one?

153
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,433
They could look just like us.

154
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,735
I'd feel its head for horns.

155
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,404
And they smell like brussels sprouts.

156
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,699
Oh, yeah. I forgot about
the brussels sprouts bit.

157
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,028
Imagine catching one
and giving it to Hitler.

158
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,114
That'd be a surefire way
to get into his personal guards.

159
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,791
Then we would become best friends.

160
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,832
I thought I was your best friend.

161
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,835
Yorki, you're my second-best friend.

162
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,383
First place is reserved for the <i>Führer</i>.

163
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,929
So, unless you're Hitler hiding in a fat,
little boy's body...

164
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,302
I'd be happy with second place.

165
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,976
I guess I'm just a kid
in a fat kid's body.

166
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,599
Case closed.

167
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,934
Raah! Raah! Raah!

168
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,649
When you stand before the enemy
and have to end his life,

169
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,154
which of you will have
the stomach to do this?

170
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,944
Good.

172

173
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,285
We want hardened warriors.

174
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,793
Those that are prepared to kill at will.

175
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,257

176
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,335
- Yes.

179
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,013
Pfff. Of course. I love killing.

180
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,604
Good. Come here.

181
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,605
Don't be scared. Come on.

182
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,736

Huh?

185
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,295
Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.

186
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,802
Or are you scared?

187
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,721
I'm not scared. I... I just...

188
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,257
Now.

189
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:50,644
Place both hands around its neck
and then one hard twist.

190
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,980
He might scream, but we'll just use
the boot to finish it off.

191
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,323
Kill. Kill.

192
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,785

00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,643
Good shot.

- Really?

203
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,357
But no one has heard
from him in two years.

204
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,158
He is a deserting coward.

What was all that about?

216
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,405
They wanted me to kill it.

217

I'm sorry. I couldn't.

I couldn't care less.

Let them say whatever they want.

221
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,254
People used to say a lot
of nasty things about me.

"Oh, this guy's a lunatic."

223
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,718
"Oh, look at that psycho.
He's gonna get us all killed."

224
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,682
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The rabbit is no coward.

225

The humble little bunny faces
a dangerous world every day,

226

for his country.

Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

234
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,089
Let me give you some really good advice.

235
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,131
Be the rabbit.

236
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,548
The humble bunny
can outwit all of his enemies.

237
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,756
He's brave and sneaky and strong.

238
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,683
Be the rabbit.

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,804

No.

00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,658
Case closed.

247
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:53,239
Now, it's time for Jojo
to show those stick insects

Okay, well, I'll just say

I'm not scared of you

426
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,701

- Jew.
- Yeah. Jew, yeah.

00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,819

- You think of something.

Oh, now I'm the expert?

439

Stop offering me
damned cigarettes! I'm ten!

440
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,655
All right. Sorry. I'm stressed out!

441
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,117
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

442
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,044
You can't tell your mother
or that Jew will cutoff your Nazi head,

443
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,714
but there's no reason this thing
in the attic needs to ruin your life.

444
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,963
In fact, you could use it
to your advantage.

445
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:42,964
How?

446
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,092
When someone tries to use
mind powers on me,

447
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,092
know what I do?

448
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,799
Use mind powers back on them.

449
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,430
Remember last year
when that one-arm pirate von Stauffenberg

450
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,976
tried to blow me up with a table bomb?

451
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,099
Yeah, you survived.

452
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,180
Correctomundo.

453
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,480
The only reason I survived,

454
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,308
apart from having bombproof legs,

455
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,985
is because I outwitted old von Stauffy.

456
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,815
I let him think that I was dead, when
in actual fact, I was absolutely fine.

457
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,152
By pretending I was dead,
I drew out all the traitors.

458
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,407
So what are you going to do?

459
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,987
Pretend I'm dead?

460
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,914
Exactly. Wait, no.

461
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,325
No, what I mean is this:

462
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,285
make her feel safe
and then she'll drop her guard

463
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,870
and then you will be the one in control.

464
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,832
- Reverse psychology.
- Don't complicate things.

465
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,758
Just use my backwards mind power trick,

466
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,130
and everything will be fine.

467
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,048

470
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,809
Remember, a Jew living in your wall

471
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,228
is better than two Jews flying around
with their bat wings

472
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,397
climbing down chimneys
and eating innocent Nazis.

473

We just don't know it.

531
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,255
Perhaps.

532
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,423
You've lived more lifetimes than most.

533
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,972
I haven't lived at all.

534
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,851
You're being challenged.

535
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,476
They say you can't live,
that you won't live.

536
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,645
If that comes true, then they win.

537
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,900
They've been winning so far.

538
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,859
They'll never win.
That's the power you have.

539
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,161
As long as there's someone alive,
somewhere, then they lose.

540
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,866
They didn't get you yesterday or today.
You make tomorrow the same.

541
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,331
Hey.

542
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,088
Tomorrow must be the same.

543
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,014
♪♪

544
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,286
Jesus Christ!

545
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,739
You must stretch.

546
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,994
Does that hurt you?

547
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,543
- Yes.
- Good. Pain is your friend.

548
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,338
Soon your leg will only be
a little bit deformed and pointless.

549
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,916
I'm going to recommend
another month off school though

550
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,468
because your face
might scare the other kids.

551
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,296
It's kind of ugly.

552
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,222
Okay, who's next?

553
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,345
Jojo.

554
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,725
Baby, I have to go.

555
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,144
I'll see you at home. Mmm.

556
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,861
- Hi, Captain K.
- Hey.

557
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,242
- If it isn't <i>Herr</i> Hand Grenade himself.
- Ah.

558
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,572
How's the leg, kid?

559
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,204
It's pretty much healed.

560
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,662
It only 80 percent hurts now.

561
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,291
What are you guys doing?

562
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,089
I'm being made to teach the HJ boys

563
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,506
water warfare training.

564
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,678
You know, in case they ever need
to go to battle in a swimming pool.

565
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,342
Can I ask you a question about Jews?

566
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,348
Oh, God. Why?

567
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,599
What should I do if I see one?

568
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,774
Ugh. Okay.

569
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,478
If you see a Jew, you tell us,

570
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,609
we tell the Gestapo, and they tell the SS,

571
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,281
and then they go and they kill the Jew.

572
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,274
And anyone who helped the Jew.

573
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,244
And because these are very paranoid times,

574
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,163
probably some other people just in case.

575
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,785
It's a pretty drawn out process.

576
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,369
Even if the Jew hypnotized someone

577
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,295
to make them hide
the Jew in the first place?

578
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,997
I'd be amazed if that could happen.

579
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,377
No, it can happen.

580
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,759
It happened to my uncle.

581
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,466
A Jew hypnotized him

582
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,393
and he became
a massive drunk and a gambler.

583
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,096
And he cheated on his wife

584
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,649
and he had an inappropriate
relationship with my sister.

585
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,648
And then he drowned
in an unrelated accident,

586
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,025
but it was the Jew's fault.

587
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,573
Anyway. Did you see one? A Jew.

588
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,323
I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.

589
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,323
Yeah, me neither.

590
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,371
Without their funny hats,
it's damn near impossible.

591
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,699
Someone should write a book
on the subject.

592
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,284
It would make things
so much easier.

593
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,211
- It would be a hit.
<i>- Ja.</i>

594
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,085
Finkie, they're drowning. Come on.

595
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,504
I'll see you later, little man.

596
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,220
♪♪

597
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,023
Okay, here's the situation.

598
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,027
If I tell on you,
you'll be in big trouble,

599
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,578
and I don't think you want that.

600
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,116
But then you'll tell on me and my mother,
and we'll be in trouble,

601
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,792
which I don't want.

602
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,246
And if you tell my mother I know,
then she'll kick you out,

603
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,671
which you don't want.

604
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,212
And if I tell my mother I know,

605
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,094
then you'll cutoff my Nazi head,

606
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,675
which I also don't want.

607
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,850
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

608
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,428
It's just a normal stalemate.

609
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,889
I have some conditions
for allowing you to stay here.

610
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,690
- "Conditions?"
- Yes.

611
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,144
Tell me everything about the Jewish race.

612
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,895
Okay.

613
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,948
We're like you,

614
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,613
but human.

615
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,445
Please take this seriously.

616
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,239
Think of this as an exposé.

617
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,949
I want to know all your secrets.

618
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,418
Kindly refrain from sitting
on my sister's bed.

619
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,712
Why? She doesn't need it.

620
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,790
You know nothing of my sister.

621
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,091
Inge and I were friends.

622
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,594
I remember you.

623
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,717
Such a funny little boy.

624
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,889
Pfft. Enough with the small talk.

625
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,887
Start telling me about your kind.

626
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,184
Obviously, we are demons who love money.

627
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,389
Right?

628
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,475
Obviously. Everyone knows that.

629
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:03,654
But what people don't know
is that we're also allergic to food.

630
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,236
Cheese, bread, meat.

631
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,942
That stuff will kill us instantly.

632
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,698
So, if you're thinking of ending my life,

633
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,530
that's the fastest way.

634
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,285
Also biscuits, lethal.

635
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,418
Very funny.

636
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,041
Anyway, there's not enough food for you,

637
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,588
so I don't know what you're going to do.

638
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,791
Your mother managed to find me some bread.

639
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,883
She's kind. She treats me like a person.

640
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,010
But you're not. Not a proper person.

641
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,340
Are you?

642
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,894
How dare you, Jew!

643
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,440
You are weak like an eyelash.

644
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,360
I am born of Aryan ancestry.

645
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,064
My blood is the color of a pure red rose.

646
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,774
And my eyes are blue like...

647
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,409
Break free.

648
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:56,411
Break free, great Aryan.
There are no weak Jews.

649
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,419
I am descended from those
who wrestle angels and kill giants.

650
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,337
We were chosen by God.

651
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,415
You were chosen by a pathetic little man

652
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,376
who can't even grow a full mustache.

653
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,879
The stronger race, huh?

654
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,516
So, how's it all going
with that Jew thing upstairs?

655
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,647
Well, she doesn't want to talk to me.

656
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,694
Mm-hmm. Well, you are a Nazi.

657
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,363
I guess.

658
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,986
This book is going to be harder to write
than I thought.

659
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,738
Hmm.

660
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,703
What's she doing?
She's burning something.

661
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,450
What is she burning?

662
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,912
- What are you burning?
- She can't hear you.

663
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,747
What are you burning?

664
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,517
Why so happy?

665
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:58,935
Things are changing.

666
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,478
The Allies have taken Italy.

667
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,772
France will be next
and soon the war will be over.

668
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,897
Goddamn it! Why does that make you happy?

669
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,443
You hate your country that much?

670
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,362
I love my country. It's the war I hate.

671
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,065
It's pointless and stupid,

672
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,741
and the sooner we have peace, the better.

673
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,317
Oh, the war will end.

674
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,949
We will crush our enemies into dust.

675
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,405
And when they are destroyed,

676
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,955
we shall use their graves as toilets.

677
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,875
Okay. No more politics.

678
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,248
Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.

679
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,545
Let's eat.

680
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,714
You aren't eating.

681
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,718
No. I am not that hungry.

682
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,473
I might eat later.

683
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,976
For now, I am just going
to chew on these grapes.

684
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,400
Well, I'm especially hungry tonight.

685
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,198
So maybe I'll just finish yours.

686
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,358
Don't want it to go to waste.

687
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,091
How was your day, Johannes?

688
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,719
Oh, you know, just wandered around,

689
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,763
being a deformed kid
with nothing to live for.

690
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,055
You're not deformed.

691
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,931
My face looks like
a goddamn street map, woman.

692
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,430
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

693
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,983
If my father were here, he'd get it.

694
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,776
Well, he's not.

695
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,730
I know. And instead, I'm stuck with you.

696
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,108
You want your dad, eh?

697
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,192
Yeah, I do.

698
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,243
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,536
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

700
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,533
Fine.

701
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,087
Don't you ever talk
to your goddamn mother like that!

702
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,947
Paul, what happened?

703
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,528
Paul?

704
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,109
I yelled at the kid.

705
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,445
What? Go apologize.

706
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,825
Sorry, kid.

707
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,205
What?

708
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,832
What kind of apology was that?

709
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,471
Sorry, kid.

710
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,680
Jojo...

711
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,976
I know you miss me, but I'm...

712
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,393
I'm out there trying to make
a difference in the world.

713
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,561
And while I'm gone,

714
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,114
I need you to take care of my Rosie.

715
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,737
Can you do that?

716
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,821
Yes, Dad.

717
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,531
Thanks.

718
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,659
She's doing what she can.

719
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,131
Oh, gosh. We made a good kid, huh?

720
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,253
Mm-mm! Damn, that's good.

721
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,965
It reminds me of dancing
with Rosie in The Red Salon.

722
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,175
You remember, honey?

723
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,634
Of course I do, babe.

724
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,734
Hey, don't just
sit there, kid.

725
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:39,815
Come.

726
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,399
Dance with your parents, come.

727
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,997
So, I'd like you to draw
a picture of where Jews live.

728
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,419
Where you all eat, sleep,

729
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,463
and where the queen Jew lays the eggs.

730
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,506
You really are an idiot.

731
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,959
Come on. We have
a lot of work to do.

732
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,677
Tell me about your family.

733
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,845
I'll tell you about the Jews,

734
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,923
but you are not privileged
to know about my family.

735
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,634
<i>Bu“ need background.</i>

736
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,844
Why are you hanging around with me?

737
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,099
Don't you have any friends?

738
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,726
Of course. Yorki.

739
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,352
- "Yorki?"
- Amongst others.

740
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,810
Well, you don't have anyone.

741
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,110
I have Nathan.

742
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,188
"Nathan?" Who the hell is that?

743
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,240
- My fiancé. I have him.
- Where is he?

744
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,568
Fighting in the resistance, see.

745
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,327
He proposed to me
on the banks of the <i>Fluß</i>.

746
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,627
He knelt down like a proper gentleman,
recited a poem by Rilke.

747
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,296
And when I said yes,
we danced into the night.

748
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,123
Snore.

749
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,208
Who's Rilke?

750
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,293
A great poet. Nathan's favorite.

751
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,003
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yay.

752
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,680
He's coming to rescue me,
then we'll go live in Paris.

753
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,508
You'd turn your back on Germany forever?

754
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,719
It turned on me first.

755
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,599
Well, we don't need you.

756
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,897
You and your stupid boyfriend can shut up

757
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:41,524
and go live in damn
cheese, snail, baguette land.

758
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,314
Now, now, just because
you don't have a girlfriend.

759
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,069
I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.

760
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,446
One day, you'll make time.

761
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,195
You'll think of nothing else.

762
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,748
You'll meet someone and spend your days

763
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,792
dreaming of the moment
you can hold them in your arms again.

764
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,246
That's love.

765
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,508
- Ridiculous.
- Finished.

766
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,225
I said to draw where Jews live.

767
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,852
This is just a stupid picture of my head.

768
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,234
Yeah. That's where we live.

769
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,527
Rilke, Rilke, Rilke.

770
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,534
Where are you? Poetry-writing dumbhead.

771
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,659
Ah.

772
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,162
Yes. Great thinking, Rabbit.

773
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,291
We'll use all of these books to make
a fake floor that she'll fall through.

774
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,748
Straight into a pit full of piranhas

775
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,584
and... and lava and bacon.

776
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,673
- Why, she won't know what hit her.
- Shh!

777
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,128
- Shh?
- Shh!

778
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,839
You shush. Shush me?

779
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,095
Let's get a book and let's go.
Libraries are dumb.

780
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,223
♪♪

781
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:01,649
Yeah, this is a really good idea,
what we're doing right now.

782
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:05,320
If she had a heart,
this would break it clean in two.

783
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,900
I have something to tell you.

784
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,532
I came across an old letter from Nathan,

785
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,247
your fiancé, addressed to you.

786
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,247
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'll just read it.

787
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,873
"Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say,

788
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,584
"but don't want to marry you anymore.

789
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,179

790
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,006

00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,512
"It's like my favorite poet, Rilke, says,

00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:40,518
"'We need in love to practice only this:
letting each other go.'

793
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,349
"So, goodbye and sorry
about letting you go.

794
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,612
"From Nathan, your ex-fiancé.

795
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,028
"PS, I'm not really in the resistance.

00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,199
"I was lying.

797
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,903
I'm unemployed and quite fat now."

798
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,933
Um... don't open the door,

799
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:28,190
but I actually forgot
there was a second letter.

800
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,648
"Dear Elsa..."

801
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,444
"I just wanted to let you know that
I don't want to break up with you now.

802
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:41,200
"I changed my mind because I don't
want you to kill yourself over me,

Yours, Nathan."

813
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,691
- Beethoven.
- Einstein.

814
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,151
- Bach.
- Gershwin.

815
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,157
Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.

816
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,738
Musicians, is that all you have?

817
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:21,823
Rilke.

818
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,328
Oh, yeah, of course.

819
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,581
Your favorite, Rilke. Jewish mother.

820
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,661
Dietrich, then.

821
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,337
Houdini.

822
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,791
No. That's impossible.

823
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,966
Believe it, brother.

824
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,010
Just ask Pissarro, Modigliani,
Man Ray, Gertrude Stein,

825
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,465
Mr. Moses and the king of them all,
Jesus Christi. Amen.

826
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,845
Pew, pew, pew!

827
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,676
Well, you're just saying any old name now.

828
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,478
I've never heard of these people
and now I'm fed up.

829
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,930
Hey.

830
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,687
If you find any more of those letters,
will you let me know?

831
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,234
Sure.

832
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,652
Okay.

833
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,729
Bye.

834
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,492
Ah, these banks
used to be full of lovers.

835
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,867
There was dancing and singing.

836
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,164
Romance.

837
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,122
There's no time for romance.

838
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,499
We're at war.

839
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,422
Oh. There's always time
for romance.

840
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,883
Someday you'll meet someone special.

841
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,794
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

842
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,259
Who else tells you that?

843
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,134
Everyone.

844
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,514
Anyway.

845
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,935
It's a stupid idea.

846
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,763
You're stupid.

847
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,440
Love is the strongest thing in the world.

848
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:33,445
I think you'll find that metal
is the strongest thing in the world.

849
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,319
Followed closely by dynamite,
and then muscles.

850
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,284
Besides, I wouldn't
even know it if I saw it.

851
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,487
Surprise, surprise.

852
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,538
Your Shoelaces are undone again.

853
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,950
Oh, Jojo.

854
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,877
You'll know when it happens.

855
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,797
You'll feel it.

856
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,873
It's a pain.

857
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,463
- In my arse, I bet.
- In your tummy.

858
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,966
Like, like, you're full of butterflies.

859
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,052
- Yuck.
- Yeah, "yuck."

860
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,761
Come on, Shitler. Let's get a move on.

861
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,854
Whoa!

862
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,648
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

863
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,852
I'm worried about you, man.
Are you drunk? Again?

864
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,107
Come on. Oh, God.

865
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,029
Could you please untie them?

866
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,232
- You're really getting fat.
- I'm not...

867
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,818
You know what? Why don't I
just leave you here, okay?

868
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,494
- No.
- I'll come and get you tomorrow.

869
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,288
- Okay? How about that?
- No. Mama, Mama!

870
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,535
You'll figure it out, darling.

871
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,207
- No!
- I'll meet you back at the house.

872
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,705
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Mama, Mama!

873
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,749
You're growing up too fast.

874
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,799
Ten-year-olds shouldn't be celebrating war
and talking politics.

875
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,547
You should be climbing trees

876
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,800
and then falling out of those trees.

877
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,927
But the <i>Führer</i> says when we win

878
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,680
it is us, young boys
who will rule the world.

879
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,726
Pfft!

880
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,604
The <i>Reich</i> is dying.

881
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:54,480
We're going to lose the war
and then what are you going to do, hmm?

882
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,981
Life is a gift.

883
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,857

01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,398
Hey, come here. You might like
to check out what I'm working on.

1060
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,367
As part of our preparations
for the invasion,

1061
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,739
I'm redesigning my uniform.

1062
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,780
Note, the feathers for aerodynamics,

1063
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,536
the sparkly color to dazzle the enemy,

1064
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,583
the boots purely decorative.

1065
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,831
And this,

1066
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,414
this is a Gatling gun mounted with a radio

1067
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,627
which emits annoying music
to dishearten the enemy.

1068
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,553
This is all copyrighted, by the way.

1069
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,800
That means you can't copy it.

1070
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,973
<i>Ja.</i> Don't get any ideas, kid.

1071
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,520
The kids tell me that
your father's away fighting.

1072
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,395
So it appears you are now
the man of the house. How's that going?

1073
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,691
It's okay.

1074
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,686
<i>Ja?</i>

1075
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,568
So, what jobs do you have for me today?

1076

Well, I've got one, I won't lie.

1077
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,776

from what you're used to,

1078

That's what I thought at first, too,
but it's "paper-like."

1096

Well, I'm impressed.

I caught a Jew. A real one.

Oh, a Jew?

1102
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,031
I saw some that they caught
hiding in the forest last month.

1103
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,537
Personally, I didn't see
what all the fuss was about.

1104
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,457
They weren't at all scary
and seemed kind of normal.

1105
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,334
Oh, I'm getting distracted.

1106
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,132
I got to go.

1107
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,583
Bye.

1108
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,009
- Bye.
- Oh, my God.

1109
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,803
It's so hard to run in this thing.

1110
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,143
I found these.

1111
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,224
You can have them.
They're probably broken.

1112
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,604
Doesn't mean anything.

1113
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,398
Maybe you can draw something for my book.

1114
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,736
I could draw you again.

1115
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,908
No one wants to see pictures of cripples.

1116
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,278
You're hardly a cripple.

1117
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,576
Besides, true artists
don't see that stuff.

1119
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:04,538
It's fine.

1120
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,714
I'll just accept I'll be one of those guys

1121
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,166
who'll never get to kiss a girl.

1122
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,760
You will be kissed, Jojo.

1123

1124
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,052
Okay.

1125
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,387
Two things.

1126
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,597
Thing number one:

1127
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,559
It's illegal for Nazis and Jews
to hang out like we do,

1128
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,314
let alone kiss.

1129
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,736
Thing number two:

1130
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:33,109
It'd just be a sympathy kiss,
which doesn't count.

1131
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,907
You're not a Nazi.

1132
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,580
Uh, I'm massively into swastikas,

1133
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,703

a pretty good sign right there.

01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,440
that of the "Goldilockses."

1233
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,989
Sneaking around,
eating other people's food,

1234
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,696
sleeping in their beds.

1235
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,778
It really is quite rude.

1236
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,956
I don't suppose I could see
your papers, could I?

1237
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,502
Papers, Miss Betzler. Quickly, please.
We don't have all day.

1238
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,630
Yes, of course.

1239
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,208
How old are you in this photo?

1240
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,503
They're three years old.

1241
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:47,834
I was 14.

1242
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,586
Date of birth?

1243
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:53,506
First of May.

1244
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,638
1929.

1245
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,350
Correct. Thank you, Inge.

1246
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,776
Get a new photo.
You look like a ghost in this one.

1247
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:06,853
Wait.

1248
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,322
What is...

1249
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:15,445
this?

1250
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:19,912
<i>Yoohoo Jew.</i>

1251
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,498
Tell me, who did this?

1252
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,204
I did.

1253
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,789
It's an exposé on Jews.

1254
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,793
How they think, behave, look.

1255
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,635
It'll be a gift to the <i>Führer.</i>

1256
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:35,928
Guys, you have to see this.

1257
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,552
Oh, look at this one. He has a tail.

1258
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,889
There's one of them hanging upside down
like a bat.

1259
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,776
This one here, it is
a drawing of their heads.

1260
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:49,900
And who is operating
the machinery of their brains?

1261
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:51,231
The devil.

1262
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,653
Ah, it's funny 'cause it's true.

1263
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,281
Oh, look at this little, stupid Jew.

1264
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,033
There they are with horns.

1265
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,364
What is this?

1266
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,912
"Die, Nathan, die."

1267
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,790
"Ways of killing Nathan."

1268
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,872
Nathan being tortured by snakes.

1269
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:07,831
Poked with sticks.

1270
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,415
Being fired from a cannon

1271
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,171
and just being called names.

1272
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,920
Yeah. Nathan being crushed under the wheel

1273
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,097
of an old-time penny-farthing bicycle.

1274
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,514
Who is Nathan, please?

1275
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,760
Just some boy.

1276
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,813
Nathan being roasted
over an open fire.

1277
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,390
Reminds me, we must get back and...

1278
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,770
You remember? 'Cause
we left that guy hanging up.

1279
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,397
- Ja. Ja.
- Thank you for this.

1280
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,852
You have really made my day.

1281
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,731
I do hope you continue with it.

1282
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,190
And, of course,

1283
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:37,118
if you see anything suspicious,
give us a ring.

1284
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,029
Good day.

1285
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,531
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1286
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,832
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

1287
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,500
Nice to meet you, Inge.

1288
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,345
Stay home, Jojo.

1289
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,430
Look after your family.

1290
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,885
Look after this knife.

1291
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,495
Elsa, you fooled them.

1292
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:27,744
May seventh.

1293
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:30,622
What?

1294
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,760
She was born on the seventh,
not the first.

1295
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,223
He was helping us.

1296
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,601
They'll be back.

1297
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,805
They'll figure out she's dead,
then I'll be dead.

1298
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,943
Nobody really knows Inge died.

1299
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,526
You could be her.

1300
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,821
I'll tell Mama everything
when she gets home.

1301
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,780
That I know you and that we're fiends.

1302
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,201
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

1303
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,793
Man, that was a complete bust.

1304
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,173
You mind explaining that?

1305
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,504
She's not...

1306
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,057
She doesn't seem like a bad person.

1307
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,182
I am beginning
to question your loyalty

1308
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,643
to myself and the party.

1309
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,354
You call yourself a patriot?

1310
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,860
Yet, where is the evidence?

1311
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,487
The German soldier
was born out of necessity.

1312
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,654
Germany depends on the passion
of these young men.

1313
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,911
Passion and the readiness
to fall for the Fatherland

1314
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:51,370
despite the futile efforts
of Allied war profiteers

1315
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:56,300
who send their ill-prepared armies
clumsily into the lair of the wolf.

1316
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:00,128
And only zealous men who stand steadfast
in the face of the enemy

1317
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,055
will be etched in German memory forever.

1318
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:07,643
And it is up to you to decide
if you want to be remembered,

1319
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,267
or disappear without a trace

1320
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:14,442
like a pitiful grain of sand into a desert
of insignificance.

1321
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:20,986
To put it plainly...

1322
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,195
get your shit together
and sort out your priorities.

1323
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,076
You're ten, Jojo.

1324
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,948

She didn't tell me much...

01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,006
They were put on a train.

1344
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,006
I ran.

The Russians, Jojo. They're coming.

01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,951
And the Americans from the other way.

1391
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,330

Help me with this ammo.

1394
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,092
- And how are we doing?
- Terribly.

1395
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,089
Our only friends are the Japanese.

1396
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,593
And just between you and me,
they don't look very Aryan.

1397
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,350
- Remember that Jew I told you about?
- Oh, yeah.

1398
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,472
I still have her.

1399
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,179
She's basically my girlfriend now.

1400
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:14,015
Oh, good for you, Jojo. A girlfriend.

1401
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,727
But, you know, she's Jewish.

1402
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,859
There are bigger things to worry about
than Jews, Jojo.

1403
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,156
There's Russians somewhere out there.

1404
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:25,075
They're worse than anyone.

1405
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:28,405

and have sex with dogs.
