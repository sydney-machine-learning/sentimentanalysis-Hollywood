2
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,818
Blake.

3
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:34,405
Blake!

4
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,405
Sorry, Sarge.

5
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:39,780
Pick a man, bring your kit.

6
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,793
Yes, Sarge.

7
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:06,397
- Don't dawdle.
- No, Sarge.

8
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,550
Did they feed us?

9
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,596
No, just mail.

10
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,664
Myrtle's having puppies.

11
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,512
You get anything?

12
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:48,363
No.

13
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:52,564
I'm bloody starving, aren't you?

14
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,670
I thought we might get
some decent grub out here.

15
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:59,266
It was the only reason
I decided against the priesthood.

16
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,973
- What you got there?
- Ham and bread.

17
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,050
Where did you find that?

18
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,498
I have my uses.

19
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:14,637
Here.

20
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,786
Tastes like old shoe.

21
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:25,569
Cheer up. This time next week
it'll be chicken dinner.

22
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:30,250
Not me. My leave got cancelled.

23
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,279
They say why?

24
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,326
No idea.

25
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:37,983
It's easier not to go back at all.

26
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:51,479
Something's up.
Did you hear anything?

27
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,929
No.

28
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,006
Has to be the push, right?

29
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,707
Ten-bob says we're going up.

30
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,683
I'm not taking that bet.

31
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,665
Why? 'Cos you know I'm right?

32
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,305
No. Because you haven't got ten-bob.

33
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:13,047
In your own time, gentlemen.

34
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,481
- Is there any news, Sarge?
- News of what?

35
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,883
The big push.

36
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:20,070
It was supposed to happen weeks ago.
They told us we'd be home by Christmas.

37
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,498
Yes, well, sorry to disrupt
your crowded schedule, Blake,

38
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,714
but the Brass Hats
didn't fancy it in the snow.

39
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,323
More's the pity, Sarge,
I could've done with some turkey.

40
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:30,237
Well, I'll make sure to relay
your displeasure to command.

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
So, what's on the cards then, Sergeant?

42
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:34,101
The Hun are up to something.

43
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:36,213
- Any idea what?
- No.

44
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,929
But it's bound to ruin
our weekend.

45
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,966
Now listen, Erinmore is inside,
so tidy yourselves up.

46
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:51,895
Never know -

47
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,872
might be mentions
in dispatches for this one,

48
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,872
if you don't bugger it up.

49
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:03,321
Must be something big
if the General's here.

50
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:16,109
Lance Corporals
Blake and Schofield, Sir.

51
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:20,723
- Which one of you is Blake?
- Sir.

52
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:24,340
You have a brother,
a Lieutenant in the 2nd Devons?

53
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,664
Yes, sir.
Joseph Blake, is he...?

54
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:29,307
Alive, as far as I know.

55
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,612
And with your help
I'd like to keep it that way.

56
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,597
Sanders tells me you're good
with maps, is that true?

57
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:38,068
Good enough, Sir.

58
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,972
So.

59
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,928
We are here.

60
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,432
The 2nd Devons are advancing here.

61
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,938
How long will it take you
to get there?

62
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,780
I don't understand, Sir.

63
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,349
Sir, that land is held
by the Germans.

64
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,582
Germans have gone.

65
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,774
Don't get your hopes up.
It appears to be a strategic withdrawal.

66
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:06,710
They seem to have created a new line,
nine miles back here, by the looks of it.

67
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:09,668
Colonel MacKenzie is in command
of the 2nd.

68
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,474
He sent word yesterday morning
he was going after the retreating Germans.

69
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:17,222
He is convinced
he has them on the run -

70
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:20,694
that if he can break their lines now,
he will turn the tide.

71
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:23,031
He is wrong.

72
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:28,007
Colonel MacKenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemy's new line.

73
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,346
Come round here, Gentlemen.

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,344
Three miles deep, field fortifications,
defences, artillery,

75
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,724
the like of which we've
never seen before.

76
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,419
The 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow.

77
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:45,196
They have no idea
what they are in for.

78
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,554
And we can't warn them -
as a parting gift,

79
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:50,248
the enemy cut
all our telegram lines.

80
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,880
Your orders are to get to the 2nd

81
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,933
at Croisilles Wood, one mile
south-east of the town of Ecoust.

82
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,302
Deliver this to Colonel MacKenzie.

83
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:02,556
It is a direct order to call off
tomorrow morning's attack.

84
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,657
If you don't,
it will be a massacre.

85
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:10,599
We would lose two battalions.
1600 men, your brother among them.

86
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:13,301
You think you can get there in time?

87
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,443
- Yes, Sir.
- Any questions?

88
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,394
- No, Sir.
- Good.

89
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,623
Over to you, Lieutenant.

90
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,894
Supplies, Gentlemen.

91
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:29,424
Map, torches, grenades,
and a couple of little treats.

92
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,137
Leave immediately, take this trench west,
up on Sauchiehall Street,

93
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,538
then north-west
on Paradise Alley at the front.

94
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,593
Continue along the front line
until you find the Yorks.

95
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,831
Give this note to Major Stevenson.
He's holding the line

96
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,950
at the shortest span
of No Man's Land.

97
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,834
You'll cross there.

98
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,024
It will be daylight, Sir.
They'll see us.

99
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:50,349
There's no need to be concerned.
You should meet no resistance.

100
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:59,444
Sir, is it just us?

101
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:05,239
"Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,
He travels the fastest who travels alone."

102
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,697
- Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Sir. I would.

103
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,287
Good luck.

104
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,966
Blake - let's talk about this
for a minute.

105
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,278
Why?

106
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,500
Blake!

107
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:42,651
We just need to think about it.

108
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,939
There's nothing to think about.
He's my big brother.

109
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,567
We should at least wait
until it's dark.

110
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,430
Erinmore said to leave immediately.

111
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,552
Erinmore's never seen
No Man's Land.

112
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:53,167
We won't make it 10 yards.
If we just wait.

113
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,932
You heard him.
He said the Boche have gone.

114
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,650
Is that why he gave us grenades?

115
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:11,661
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

116
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,862
All I'm saying is that we wait.

117
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:26,481
Yes, you would say that,
because he's not your brother, is it?

118
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,917
Look, the last time I was told
the Germans were gone, it didn't end well.

119
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:35,979
You don't know, Blake,
you weren't there.

120
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,862
Excuse me. Excuse me!

121
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:48,778
You're going up a down trench
you bloody idiots.

122
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,814
Orders of the General, Sir.

123
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,737
Alright, say the Boche have gone.

124
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,472
Nine miles will take us, what, six hours?
Eight at the very most.

125
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,719
So, we've got time
to wait until the sun sets...

126
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:14,838
It's enemy territory, we've got
no idea what we're walking into.

127
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:19,554
Blake, if we're not clever about this,
no one will get to your brother.

128
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,655
I will.

129
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:26,516
We're here.
This is the front line.

130
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,546
Now we need to find the Yorks.

131
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,697
- Watch who you're shoving.
- Get out of the way then.

132
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:22,432
Who the fuck do you think you are,
pushing wounded soldiers around?

133
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,247
Let go of me!

134
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:26,145
Arsehole knocked down our Sergeant,
the man's fucking wounded!

135
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,039
I'm sorry, alright, I'm sorry.

136
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,209
- We're on commission.
- Just let me through.

137
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,210
- Orders from the General.
- Just let me through.

138
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,570
Get out of the way.

139
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,726
Right. Just watch
where you're going.

140
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,748
It's bloody quiet.

141
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:12,203
Was it like this before Thiepval?

142
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,216
I don't remember.

143
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,472
You don't remember the Somme?

144
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:18,053
Not really.

145
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:25,454
Well, you did alright out of it.
At least wear your ribbon.

146
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:28,011
Don't have it anymore.

147
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,350
What? You lost your medal?

148
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,317
It's down, boys.

149
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,957
Stay low.

150
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:51,843
God's sake, careful there,
you're stepping on the dead.

151
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,349
That's our Sergeant.

152
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,978
Be better washing them out of this
dugout with a bloody hose.

153
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,986
Do you know where the Yorks are?

154
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,292
The next bend you'll be standing
on top of half of them.

155
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:02,440
Shot to hell two nights ago.

156
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:12,838
Yorks?

157
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:14,126
Yes, Corp.

158
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,831
Where's Major Stevenson?

159
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:18,569
Was killed a couple of nights ago,
Corporal.

160
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,666
Lieutenant Leslie has command.

161
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:22,603
Where can we find him?

162
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,536
Next dug-out.

163
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:33,479
Here.

164
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:41,291
Sir? Lieutenant Leslie, Sir?

165
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,212
What is it?

166
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,153
We have a message
from General Erinmore.

167
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:46,025
- Are you our relief?
- No, Sir.

168
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,006
Then, when the fucking hell
are they due?

169
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,696
We don't know, Sir.
But we've got orders to cross here.

170
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,583
- That is the German front line.
- We know, Sir.

171
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,949
If you'll just take the letter.

172
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,007
Settle a bet, what day is it?

173
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,670
Friday.

174
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,510
Friday? Well, well, well.
None of us was right.

175
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,387
This idiot thought it was Tuesday.

176
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,947
Sorry, Sir.

177
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,189
Are they out of their fucking minds?

178
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:13,316
One slow night, and the brass think
the Hun have just gone home.

179
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,153
Do you think they're wrong, Sir?

180
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,683
We lost an officer
and three men two nights ago.

181
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,510
They were shot to bits
patching up wire.

182
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,319
We dragged two of them back here.
Needn't have bothered.

183
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:26,564
Sir, the General is sure
the enemy have withdrawn.

184
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:27,952
There are aerials
of the new line...

185
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:31,252
Shut up. We've fought and died
over every inch of this fucking place,

186
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:34,229
now they suddenly give us miles?
It's a trap.

187
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,805
But, chin up.
There's a medal in it for sure.

188
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:43,229
Nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow.

189
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,126
Alright.

190
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,237
Where's the nearest
way through, Sir?

191
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:54,017
Our wire's a mess.
But there is a path through, of sorts.

192
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,823
Rushworth! Let him look.

193
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,439
Straight ahead, to the left,
past the dead horses.

194
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,598
There's a gap directly behind them.

195
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,112
Useful, because if it's dark
you follow the stench.

196
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:12,990
When you get to the second wire,
look out for the bowing chap.

197
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,054
There's small break
just beside him.

198
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:18,261
The German line
is a 150 odd yards after that.

199
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,380
Watch out for the craters.
They're deeper than they look.

200
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,728
You fall in, there's no getting out.
This way.

201
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,563
Wake up, Kilgour.
Bloody waste of space.

202
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,769
Any cover, Sir?
Anywhere to jump off from?

203
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,050
No, the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago.

204
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,943
It's full of bodies anyway.
Your best bet is to pop over here.

205
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,671
If you do get shot,
try to make it back to the wire.

206
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:45,995
We won't come after you,
not until it's dark.

207
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:50,006
And, if by some fucking miracle
you do make it, send up a flare.

208
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:51,802
Don't have any, Sir.

209
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,280
Well, get him one, Kilgour!
Make yourself useful.

210
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,346
Yes, Sir.

211
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,394
"Through this holy unction
may the Lord pardon thee

212
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,457
all faults or whatever sins
thou hast committed."

213
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:11,620
I do hate losing these to the Hun.
So, when they start shooting at you,

214
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,638
could you be so kind as to
throw it back, there's a good chap.

215
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:19,840
Cheerio.

216
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,869
You sure?

217
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:31,353
Yes.

218
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:39,796
Age before beauty.

219
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,014
You alright?

220
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,764
Look for cover.

221
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,912
Sap trench.

222
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,113
Alright.

223
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,900
Stay still.

224
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:33,995
They're ours.

225
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,569
Keep going. We're half-way.

226
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,289
There's a gap in the wire.

227
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,669
Sco...

228
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,609
There! That's the front line.

229
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:38,584
Fuck me. They really have gone.

230
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:01,330
Your hand alright?

231
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,426
Put it through an effing German.

232
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,330
Patch it up.

233
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,873
You'll be wanking again
in no time.

234
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:12,477
Wrong hand.

235
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:44,783
They're not long gone.

236
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,431
No good.

237
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,092
Blocked.

238
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:35,637
This might be a way through.

239
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,327
Jesus...

240
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:04,253
Look at this. It's massive.

241
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:09,758
They built all this.

242
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,533
Here's our way through.

243
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,672
Sco.

244
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:02,764
How about this?

245
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:08,148
Bloody hell!

246
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,174
Even their rats
are bigger than ours.

247
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:21,998
What do you think
is in the bags?

248
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,894
You cannot be that hungry.

249
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:33,739
Look at him. Cocky little bastard.

250
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,385
You could eat this, though.

251
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,531
- What is it?
- Boche dog meat.

252
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:43,031
What's in the other boxes?

253
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,055
What's wrong?

254
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:49,057
Trip wire. Don't move.

255
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,104
Where is it?

256
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:56,198
Goes from here to the door.

257
00:27:58,949 --> 00:27:59,907
Jesus!

258
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:01,512
No! No!

259
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:13,279
Sco?!

260
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:20,374
Sco!

261
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,650
Sco!

262
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,212
Sco!

263
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:38,965
Sco!

264
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:47,833
Sco! Wake up! Wake up!

265
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,382
Sco! Sco!

266
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:59,138
Stand up! Stand up!
Come on! Stand up!

267
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,890
Up! Up! Up!

268
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:05,464
Come on! Stand up!

269
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:13,377
The whole thing's coming down.
Come on.

270
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:20,363
You keep hold of me!

271
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,017
We need to keep moving. Come on!

272
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:39,363
I can't see. I can't see!

273
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,764
Stop! Stop!

274
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,670
Stop. It's a mineshaft.

275
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:48,327
We will have to jump. Come on!

276
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,068
You're going to have to jump!
Just jump.

277
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,314
I can't... I can't see!

278
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,243
You need to trust me. Jump!

279
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:07,736
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go!

280
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:13,348
Light! There's light!

281
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:26,741
Stop. Stop.

282
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,893
Just let me stand.

283
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,472
Dirty bastards!

284
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,231
Careful, they may have left
other traps.

285
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:53,660
Jesus.

286
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:07,026
Dust. So much dust in my eyes.

287
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:18,774
Here. Have some of mine.

288
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:27,689
I wish I'd shot that rat now.

289
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,962
And I wish you'd picked
some other bloody idiot.

290
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:31,925
What?

291
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:34,528
Why in God's name
did you have to choose me?

292
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,793
I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

293
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:38,522
No, you didn't.

294
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,342
You never know.
That's your problem.

295
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,971
Alright then, go back.
Nothing's stopping you.

296
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:49,883
You can go all the way
bloody home if you want.

297
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:52,680
Don't. Just don't.

298
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:56,667
I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

299
00:31:57,018 --> 00:32:00,813
I thought they were going to send us back
up the line, or for food, or something.

300
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:04,917
I thought it was going to be
something easy, alright?

301
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,769
I never thought it would be this.

302
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:17,370
So, do you want to go back?

303
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,234
Just fire the fucking flare.

304
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:40,388
Up yours, Lieutenant.

305
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,740
Do you know where we are?

306
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:02,733
Ecoust is directly south-east.

307
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:08,220
And if we keep that bearing,
we should make it.

308
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,859
Come on then.

309
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:41,718
Look at that.
They destroyed their own guns.

310
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:45,230
They destroyed
their own trenches too.

311
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,777
What do you mean?

312
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:52,020
I think they wanted us to go that way.
They wanted to bury us.

313
00:33:59,952 --> 00:34:01,887
Bastard rats.

314
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,252
Hey, did you hear that story
about Wilko?

315
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:13,847
How he lost his ear?

316
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,923
I'm not in the mood.
Keep your eyes on the trees,

317
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:18,718
top of the ridge.

318
00:34:21,772 --> 00:34:23,990
Bet he told you it was shrapnel.

319
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:27,169
What was it then?

320
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:31,485
Well, you know his girl's
a hairdresser, right?

321
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:36,254
And he was moaning about the lack of
bathing facilities when he wrote to her -

322
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:39,039
remember those rancid
Jakes at Arras?

323
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:43,112
Anyway, she sends him over
this 'hair oil'.

324
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:47,574
Smells sweet, like Golden Syrup.

325
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,056
Wilko loves the smell,

326
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,223
but he doesn't want to
cart it around in his pack, so

327
00:34:56,966 --> 00:35:01,469
he slathers it all over his barnet,
goes to sleep,

328
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:04,317
and in the middle of the night
he wakes up,

329
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:10,168
and a rat is sitting on his shoulder
licking the oil off of his head.

330
00:35:10,786 --> 00:35:14,364
Wilko panics, and he jumps up,
and when he does -

331
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,879
the rat bites clean through
his fucking ear and runs off with it!

332
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:23,620
Oh, he made a hell of a fuss,
yelling, screaming.

333
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:27,319
The best of it was he could put
so much bloody oil on himself

334
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:30,884
that he couldn't wash it off!
He was like a magnet.

335
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,817
Rats left us alone,
but they couldn't get enough of him.

336
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:35,781
Poor bastard.

337
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:46,598
Heading back home.
I wonder what they saw.

338
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,540
Watch the ridge lines.

339
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,667
Well, that's your medal
sorted then.

340
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,965
What do you mean?

341
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,678
"Lance Corporal Blake showed
unusual valour in rescuing

342
00:36:02,678 --> 00:36:06,418
a comrade from certain death"
blah, blah, blah.

343
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,472
You reckon?

344
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:11,408
I do.

345
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:17,411
Well, that'd be nice.
Since you lost yours.

346
00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:19,344
I didn't lose mine.

347
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,693
- What happened to it, then?
- Why do you care?

348
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:25,651
Why do you not?

349
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:29,340
I swapped it with a French captain.

350
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,473
You swapped it? For what?

351
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:34,668
Bottle of wine.

352
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:38,696
- What did you do that for?
- I was thirsty.

353
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:42,251
What a waste.

354
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,845
You should've taken it home
with you, you should've

355
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:49,196
given it to your family.

356
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:52,789
Men have died for that.

357
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:57,189
If I got a medal, I'd take it back home,
why didn't you just take it home...

358
00:36:57,189 --> 00:36:59,675
Look it's just a bit of bloody tin!

359
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,477
It doesn't make you special,
it doesn't make any difference to anyone.

360
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,010
Yes, it does.

361
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,783
And it's not just a bit of tin.
It's got a ribbon on it.

362
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:18,683
I hated going home. I hated it.

363
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:24,727
When I knew I couldn't stay.
When I knew I had to leave,

364
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:27,194
and they might never see me.

365
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,735
Jesus.

366
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,635
They chopped them all down.

367
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:09,164
Cherries.

368
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:14,259
Lamberts.

369
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,246
They might be Dukes,
hard to tell when they aren't in fruit.

370
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:24,198
What's the difference?

371
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:28,782
People think there's one type,
but there's lots of them -

372
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:33,429
Cuthberts, Queen Annes, Montmorencys.
Sweet ones, sour ones...

373
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:35,671
Why on earth
would you know this?

374
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:39,829
Mum's got an orchard, back home.
Only a few trees.

375
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:45,486
This time of year it looks like
it's been snowing, blossom everywhere.

376
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:52,044
And then in May, we have to pick them.
Me and Joe.

377
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:55,659
Takes the whole day.

378
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:58,574
So, these ones all gonners?

379
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:02,478
Oh no, they'll grow again
when the stones rot.

380
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:05,163
You'll end up with more
trees than before.

381
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:13,792
- It looks abandoned.
- Let's hope so.

382
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,871
We have to make sure.

383
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:51,317
I'll take front, you take back.

384
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:35,162
Anything?

385
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,149
Nothing.

386
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,086
Did you find any food?

387
00:40:57,086 --> 00:41:01,174
No. I don't like this place.

388
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:15,069
Map says we get over that ridge
and it's a straight shot to Ecoust.

389
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,123
Good.

390
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,014
Is that our friends again?

391
00:43:04,357 --> 00:43:07,779
Looks like it. Dogfight.

392
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,336
Who's winning?

393
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:15,349
Us, I think. Two on one.

394
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,891
They got him.

395
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,613
We should put him out
of his misery.

396
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:23,486
No. Get him some water.
He needs water.

397
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:28,470
It's alright, you're alright.
Stay still. Stay still.

398
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,166
Stop! Stop!

399
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,862
No, no, no!

400
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,354
Bastard, bloody bastard.

401
00:44:57,537 --> 00:45:00,721
Oh, God no. Oh, God no!

402
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:04,751
Jesus. Jesus, no.

403
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:07,678
We have to stop the bleeding.

404
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:09,360
Stop it. Stop it!

405
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,296
It's alright, it's going to be alright.
We're going to stand up.

406
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:15,903
Yes. Yes.

407
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,213
No! I can't. I can't.

408
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,980
- We have to get to an Aid Post.
- I can't.

409
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:29,106
- I'll carry you. It isn't very far.
- Just bring a doctor here.

410
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:31,129
We can't, we have to go together.

411
00:45:32,694 --> 00:45:35,812
We're going to get up.
We're going to get up.

412
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:44,669
Stop, please! Stop!

413
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:50,017
Put me down! Put me down,
you bastard, please! Put me down!

414
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:03,852
- You have to try to keep moving.
- Let's just sit.

415
00:46:04,048 --> 00:46:05,729
- Let me sit.
- No, we can't.

416
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:07,664
We have to find
the 2nd, remember?

417
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,377
Your brother.
We have to go now.

418
00:46:09,377 --> 00:46:11,591
You can start on without me.
I'll catch up.

419
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,384
You can't stay here.
We have to move, alright?

420
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:18,721
We have to move. Come on.

421
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:20,204
Come on!

422
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:24,587
Come on. That's it.
Come on, come on.

423
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:34,608
Your brother.
We have to find your brother.

424
00:46:37,137 --> 00:46:38,977
You'll recognise him.

425
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:44,573
He looks like me, he's a bit older.

426
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:59,036
What are they?

427
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,321
Are we being shelled?

428
00:47:04,428 --> 00:47:07,182
They're embers.
The barn is on fire.

429
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:13,772
I've been hit.

430
00:47:15,222 --> 00:47:16,979
What was it?

431
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:19,798
You were stabbed.

432
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,198
Am I dying?

433
00:47:35,614 --> 00:47:37,143
Yes.

434
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:40,096
Yes. I think you are.

435
00:47:57,236 --> 00:48:00,058
- This?
- Inside.

436
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:26,407
Will you write
to my mum for me?

437
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,299
I will.

438
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:34,080
Tell her I wasn't scared.

439
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:39,388
Anything else?

440
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:43,667
I love them.

441
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,160
I wish that...

442
00:48:49,063 --> 00:48:50,924
I wish...

443
00:48:56,486 --> 00:48:58,475
Talk to me.

444
00:49:00,525 --> 00:49:02,624
Tell me you know the way.

445
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:07,706
I know the way.

446
00:49:08,794 --> 00:49:12,141
I'm going to head south-east
until I hit Ecoust.

447
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:15,370
I'll pass through the town
and out to the east,

448
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,751
all the way to Croisilles Wood.

449
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:20,040
It'll be dark by then.

450
00:49:20,675 --> 00:49:22,566
That won't bother me.

451
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,486
I'll find the 2nd,
I'll give them the message.

452
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,270
And then I'll find your brother.

453
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:33,243
Just like you, a little older.

454
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:37,492
You alright, mate?

455
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,916
It's alright, it's okay.

456
00:51:41,405 --> 00:51:43,339
Come on, help him.

457
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:55,085
Jesus, what happened to him?

458
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:59,228
Was it the plane?
We saw the smoke.

459
00:51:59,312 --> 00:52:00,812
Yeah.

460
00:52:17,504 --> 00:52:19,441
Go fetch his things.

461
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:21,389
- Sir.
- Sir.

462
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,441
A friend?

463
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:31,244
What are you doing here?

464
00:52:31,323 --> 00:52:33,571
I have an urgent message
for the 2nd Devons.

465
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:36,539
Orders to stop
tomorrow morning's attack.

466
00:52:36,722 --> 00:52:40,181
- And where are they stationed?
- Just beyond Ecoust.

467
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:42,646
Come with me.

468
00:52:48,763 --> 00:52:50,872
Come with me, Corporal.
That's an order.

469
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,246
We're passing through Ecoust.
We can take you some of the way.

470
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:58,018
Sir.

471
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:26,262
Oh, come on Sergeant.
Put more men at the base.

472
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:29,447
At the trunk!
It'll be heavier there.

473
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:31,316
Might be a tight squeeze.

474
00:53:31,316 --> 00:53:33,744
You're not going to be able
to just lift it.

475
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:36,092
Pivot the front end to the left.

476
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:38,532
Jesus, they don't make
things easy, do they.

477
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,206
They could at least have retreated
with a bit of grace. Bastards.

478
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:43,528
Sir.

479
00:53:44,091 --> 00:53:45,990
- You're not one of mine.
- No, Sir.

480
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,895
He has an urgent message
to deliver to the 2nd Devons, Sir.

481
00:53:49,057 --> 00:53:50,779
- Can you get past it?
- No, Sir.

482
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:53,570
Oh, for God's sake.
Just move it!

483
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:56,618
There's room
in the casuals truck, sir.

484
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:59,075
- He has orders.
- Yes, yes, alright.

485
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:01,760
Come on now.
You can get through there sideways.

486
00:54:06,485 --> 00:54:08,219
How did you get here, Sir?

487
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:11,736
Crossed No Man's Land
just outside Bapaume.

488
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:13,854
Took us the whole night.

489
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:18,002
Bumped into a couple of Hun stragglers on
the way who made a nuisance of themselves.

490
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:21,611
- You going up to the new line?
- Attempting to.

491
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:25,524
The Newfoundlands have pushed forwards
and requested reinforcements.

492
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:29,081
I'm sorry about your friend.

493
00:54:30,454 --> 00:54:33,651
May I tell you something
that you probably already know?

494
00:54:35,268 --> 00:54:37,634
It doesn't do to dwell on it.

495
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:39,945
No, Sir.

496
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:41,786
Hop on.

497
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,304
Make some space there.

498
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,997
Come on, in you get!

499
00:55:05,304 --> 00:55:08,239
Alright. Here we go again boys.

500
00:55:10,623 --> 00:55:14,275
Welcome aboard the night bus
to a fuck-knows-where.

501
00:55:17,586 --> 00:55:19,245
Is that a dead dog?

502
00:55:20,871 --> 00:55:23,333
- You got a fag?
- Yeah, there you go.

503
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,861
- Butler.
- Oy.

504
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:43,529
- Carry on with that story.
- Oh yeah, right.

505
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:47,498
So, when we get off the train,
Beaufoy comes up to us,

506
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:49,605
and he's having a right go:

507
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,709
"Lance Corporal! Whatever one does,
one never lets standards slip!"

508
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,765
Then, Scott comes out of the latrine,

509
00:55:55,817 --> 00:55:58,131
he wipes his hand
on the back of Beaufoy's jacket!

510
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:00,826
Shit all down his back.

511
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:02,532
Was that meant to be Captain Beaufoy?

512
00:56:02,532 --> 00:56:04,934
Oh, piss off you.
You can't do any better.

513
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:10,158
“Men! Your rifle stocks are an embarrassment
to the entire expeditionary force.”

514
00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:12,987
You're both bloody awful.

515
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:15,211
You don't know, you barely
even speak the bloody language.

516
00:56:15,311 --> 00:56:17,175
He's got a better grasp of it
than you, Cooke.

517
00:56:17,175 --> 00:56:19,271
Go on then Jondalar,
give it a go, let's see it!

518
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:21,349
Let's hear it then Jonny!

519
00:56:21,748 --> 00:56:26,062
"Rossi! Never in my 200 years
as a soldier have I seen

520
00:56:26,062 --> 00:56:28,778
such a sorry excuse
for a latrine pit."

521
00:56:28,876 --> 00:56:31,610
Shite. That is total shit.

522
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,103
Oy! You could've taken
my teeth out with that.

523
00:56:34,103 --> 00:56:36,385
You could do with a new set.

524
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:43,447
You got somewhere you need to be?

525
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:49,075
Arsehole needs driving lessons.

526
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:05,908
- He should reverse.
- Yeah.

527
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:10,070
Try it in reverse. Reverse!

528
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:20,180
No. Stop. Stop!

529
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:22,689
Everyone needs to get out.

530
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:26,444
All out! Come on!

531
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,923
Alright, alright.
Keep your bloody hair on.

532
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:34,817
Right. One. Two. Three.

533
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:43,454
We need to get some wood,
put it under the wheels.

534
00:57:43,454 --> 00:57:46,984
No! We haven't got the time!
We all need to push. Come on.

535
00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:48,859
Come on!

536
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,147
Come oooon!

537
00:57:54,774 --> 00:57:58,385
Please. I have to go now. Please.

538
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:03,572
- Alright, come on lads. Come on!
- Come on, boys.

539
00:58:03,738 --> 00:58:07,140
One. Two. Three!

540
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:22,839
Come on boys! One last push! Yes!
One. Two. Three!

541
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:38,991
Back in. Get back in. Go.

542
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:41,868
Are you alright?

543
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:46,083
Here, Driver, how about you try
to keep it on the bloody road for a change!

544
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:47,553
Oh, piss off.

545
00:59:06,434 --> 00:59:08,571
So, where are you going?

546
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,838
I have to get to the 2nd Devons.
Just past Ecoust.

547
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:14,542
Why?

548
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:18,769
They're attacking at dawn.
I have orders to stop them.

549
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:20,210
How come?

550
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:23,216
They're walking into a trap.

551
00:59:23,216 --> 00:59:24,661
How many?

552
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,116
1600.

553
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:30,482
Jesus.

554
00:59:32,222 --> 00:59:34,425
Why did they send you
on your own?

555
00:59:35,483 --> 00:59:38,796
They didn't. There were two of us.

556
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:41,650
So, now it's down to you.

557
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,539
Yes.

558
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:46,227
You'll never make it.

559
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:52,104
Yes. I will.

560
00:59:58,158 --> 00:59:59,581
Thank you.

561
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:05,491
Look at it. Fucking look at it.

562
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:08,861
Three years fighting over this.

563
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,848
We should have just let
the bastards keep it.

564
01:00:12,474 --> 01:00:14,228
I mean, who machine guns, cows?

565
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:17,929
- Huns with extra bullets.
- Bastards.

566
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:24,726
Clever. They know if they don't shoot
the cow, you will eat it.

567
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:26,614
Still, bastards.

568
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:29,154
Yeah, it's not even our
bloody country.

569
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:31,000
How long gone
d'you reckon they are?

570
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,115
Why? Worried we'll
catch up with them?

571
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:37,595
Yeah, right.
Be a bloody miracle at this rate.

572
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:39,887
They are probably
right around the next corner.

573
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,987
Piss off, no they're not.

574
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,997
Why don't they
just bloody well give up?

575
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,176
Don't they want to go home?

576
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:52,499
They hate their wives and mothers...
and Germany must be a shit hole.

577
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:59,660
They're retreating... they're miles back.
We've got them on the ropes at least.

578
01:01:00,496 --> 01:01:03,206
No. We don't.

579
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,305
- Oh, bollocks. What's up now?
- Not another bloody tree.

580
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:12,984
- Bridge is down.
- Oh. That's a shame.

581
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,138
Looks like I'll be getting out here.
Good luck.

582
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:19,957
Keep some of that luck for yourself pal.
Think you'll be needing it.

583
01:01:19,957 --> 01:01:21,618
- Good luck, mate.
- Good luck, guv.

584
01:01:21,618 --> 01:01:23,665
- Good luck.
- Don't balls it up.

585
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,018
I hope you get there.

586
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:28,466
Thank you.

587
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:34,925
The next bridge is six miles.
We'll have to divert.

588
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:38,332
I can't, Sir.
I don't have the time.

589
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:40,276
Of course.

590
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:43,341
Best of luck.

591
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:45,396
Thank you, Sir.

592
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,123
Corporal.

593
01:01:50,893 --> 01:01:53,508
If you do manage to get
to Colonel MacKenzie,

594
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:57,001
make sure there are witnesses.

595
01:01:57,612 --> 01:01:58,854
They are direct orders, Sir.

596
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:00,433
I know.

597
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,818
But some men
just want the fight.

598
01:02:06,074 --> 01:02:07,557
Thank you, Sir.

599
01:02:11,947 --> 01:02:15,046
Driver! Move off!

600
01:12:52,813 --> 01:12:56,263
Anglais. Not German.

601
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:00,271
Friend... I'm a friend.

602
01:13:03,269 --> 01:13:07,298
This place, this town. Ecoust?

603
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:10,230
<i>C'est Ecoust?</i>

604
01:13:17,368 --> 01:13:21,304
Others? No. Just me.

605
01:13:23,553 --> 01:13:25,758
Only. Me.

606
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:29,983
I need to be somewhere.

607
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:34,356
I need to find a wood
to the South East.

608
01:13:36,473 --> 01:13:39,170
Trees... <i>Les arbres</i>?

609
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,231
<i>- Croiset?
- Croisilles?</i>

610
01:13:44,693 --> 01:13:46,495
Yes.

611
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,280
River?

612
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:57,613
River. It go there.
Trees. Croisilles.

613
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:31,910
Thank you.

614
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,211
A girl?

615
01:16:18,752 --> 01:16:20,754
What is her name?

616
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:27,012
Who is her mother?

617
01:16:35,309 --> 01:16:39,093
I have food. Here.

618
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,431
I have these.

619
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,427
You can have them - here,
take them all,

620
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:51,390
for you and the child. Here.

621
01:17:01,952 --> 01:17:03,613
Milk?

622
01:17:23,623 --> 01:17:25,486
Merci.

623
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,948
Bonjour.

624
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:38,375
Bonjour.

625
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:44,574
Children, you?

626
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:49,031
It's alright.

627
01:18:03,505 --> 01:18:06,275
"They went to sea
in a Sieve, they did,"

628
01:18:06,998 --> 01:18:09,624
In a Sieve they went to sea:

629
01:18:10,544 --> 01:18:13,696
In spite of all
their friends could say,

630
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,187
On a winter's morn,
on a stormy day,

631
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:20,173
"In a Sieve they went to sea!"

632
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:23,991
"Far and few, far and few,"

633
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:27,028
Are the lands
where the Jumblies live;

634
01:18:28,098 --> 01:18:32,129
Their heads are green,
and their hands are blue,

635
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:37,172
"And they went to sea
in a Sieve."

636
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,197
Stay. Stay. Please.

637
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,147
I have to go.

638
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:41,065
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

639
01:21:12,304 --> 01:21:14,024
Engländer!

640
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:51,866
Baumer?

641
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,892
Baumer?

642
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,232
Engländer! Engländer!

You alright, pal?

669
01:32:30,272 --> 01:32:31,501
Where are you from?

670
01:32:31,601 --> 01:32:33,829
- He's probably got the wind up.
- Well, he's not one of ours.

671
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:35,662
He's bloody soaked.

672
01:32:35,882 --> 01:32:38,558
Fuck it, let's just pick him up
and take him with us.

673
01:32:38,558 --> 01:32:40,410
Have to find the Devons.

674
01:32:41,234 --> 01:32:43,680
- What's he saying?
- What's that mate?

675
01:32:44,094 --> 01:32:48,447
The Devons.
I have to find the Devons.

676
01:32:49,637 --> 01:32:51,578
We're the Devons.

677
01:32:55,055 --> 01:32:57,659
- You're the Devons?
- Yes, Corp.

678
01:32:59,354 --> 01:33:01,224
Why haven't you gone over?

679
01:33:01,224 --> 01:33:04,209
- We're the second wave.
- They don't send us all at once.

680
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:07,223
Yeah, we're D Company,
we spent the night digging in.

681
01:33:07,349 --> 01:33:09,202
We go last.

682
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:12,088
Are you alright?

683
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,900
MacKenzie. Where's Colonel MacKenzie?

684
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,762
He's down at the line.

685
01:33:16,995 --> 01:33:18,334
- Which way?
- This way.

686
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:20,076
We're headed up there now.

687
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:22,946
Oy! Steady on mate!
Where you going?

688
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,458
Move!

689
01:33:49,064 --> 01:33:50,646
Let me by!

690
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:56,311
Let me through!

691
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:04,719
Where's your commanding officer?

692
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,872
He's in the holding pen.

693
01:34:12,743 --> 01:34:15,768
B Company, stand to!
Now listen, and listen well!

694
01:34:15,868 --> 01:34:20,065
On the first mark, A Company will advance!
B Company will then move to the front line!

695
01:34:20,065 --> 01:34:22,602
Sir, I have a message
from General Erinmore!

696
01:34:22,602 --> 01:34:23,330
Who the fuck are you?

697
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:26,815
The attack has been called off.
General Erinmore has called off the attack.

698
01:34:26,815 --> 01:34:29,853
Balls, man. We're about to go over.
We've got them on the run.

699
01:34:29,853 --> 01:34:31,763
You don't! Please.
Don't send your men over.

700
01:34:31,763 --> 01:34:32,681
Get out of the way, Corporal!

701
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:35,879
These are direct orders from Army command!
Where is the Colonel MacKenzie?

702
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:38,637
Jesus Christ, man!
Go and see the Captain!

703
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:42,493
Now I want us up there quickly,
you understand? Do you understand!

704
01:34:42,493 --> 01:34:43,867
Yes, Sir!

705
01:34:57,616 --> 01:35:00,282
Sections 9 and 10 at the ready!

706
01:35:00,882 --> 01:35:04,536
We will advance
on the first whistle blast!

707
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:08,923
You must not slow down!
If the man next to you falls, keep moving!

708
01:35:08,923 --> 01:35:10,779
Your orders are to break the lines.

709
01:35:11,016 --> 01:35:13,742
- Where is the Captain?
- He's over there.

710
01:35:15,763 --> 01:35:17,728
Sir? Sir!

711
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:23,122
Captain, I have a message.
This attack is called off.

712
01:35:23,122 --> 01:35:25,751
You have to stop,
you have to stop.

713
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:33,264
Where is Colonel MacKenzie?
Where is MacKenzie?!

714
01:36:00,805 --> 01:36:05,752
Get back! Return to your sectors.
Get back! Back! Hold fast!

715
01:36:05,905 --> 01:36:07,958
7 Platoon! One Minute!

716
01:36:08,058 --> 01:36:11,204
Sir, I have orders
to stop this attack.

717
01:36:11,412 --> 01:36:14,395
- What?
- Where is Colonel MacKenzie?

718
01:36:14,743 --> 01:36:16,282
He's further up the line.

719
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,559
How far?

720
01:36:17,559 --> 01:36:19,992
300 yards.
He's in a cut and cover.

721
01:36:20,132 --> 01:36:22,675
You'll have to wait
until the first wave goes over.

722
01:36:22,968 --> 01:36:25,417
No! No, I can't!

723
01:36:32,628 --> 01:36:36,182
7 Platoon! 30 seconds!

724
01:36:48,166 --> 01:36:51,349
You can't possibly make it
that way man, are you bloody insane?

725
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:58,252
What the hell are you doing,
Lance Corporal?

726
01:36:58,387 --> 01:37:00,648
No! No!

727
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:09,058
- Colonel MacKenzie?
- He's in there.

728
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:11,983
B Company two minutes!

729
01:38:11,983 --> 01:38:13,527
Let me through!

730
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:15,531
Let me through!

731
01:38:15,531 --> 01:38:17,746
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

732
01:38:17,946 --> 01:38:19,411
I have to see Colonel MacKenzie!

733
01:38:19,411 --> 01:38:21,284
- What are you doing?!
- I have to stop this attack.

734
01:38:21,284 --> 01:38:23,221
Colonel, we've seen flares,
the men on the left flank

735
01:38:23,221 --> 01:38:24,397
have made it
to the German Line.

736
01:38:24,397 --> 01:38:25,375
- Colonel!
- Hold him!

737
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:26,999
Colonel!

738
01:38:26,999 --> 01:38:29,089
Listen to me, listen to me!
I have a letter!

739
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:30,834
I need to see Colonel MacKenzie!

740
01:38:30,834 --> 01:38:32,549
There's no bloody way
you're getting in there, mate!

741
01:38:32,549 --> 01:38:35,137
- Sergeant! Send the next wave!
- No!

742
01:38:37,686 --> 01:38:39,381
Colonel MacKenzie!

743
01:38:39,614 --> 01:38:43,548
This attack is not to go ahead!
You've been ordered to stop.

744
01:38:43,794 --> 01:38:46,291
- You have to stop.
- Who the hell are you?

745
01:38:46,522 --> 01:38:48,795
Lance Corporal Schofield, Sir. 8th.

746
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:51,849
I have orders from General Erinmore
to call off this attack.

747
01:38:51,949 --> 01:38:53,363
You're too late, Lance Corporal.

748
01:38:53,363 --> 01:38:56,818
Sir, these orders are from Army Command.
You have to read them.

749
01:38:56,918 --> 01:38:58,408
Shall we hold back
the second wave, Sir?

750
01:38:58,408 --> 01:39:01,458
No, Major. Hesitate now and we lose.
Victory is only 500 yards away.

751
01:39:01,558 --> 01:39:06,249
- Sir! Please read the letter.
- I have heard it all before.

752
01:39:06,634 --> 01:39:08,755
I'm not going to wait
until dusk, or for fog.

753
01:39:08,755 --> 01:39:11,610
I'm not calling back my men,
only to send them out there again tomorrow.

754
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,424
Not when we've got the bastards on the run.
This is their last stand.

755
01:39:14,424 --> 01:39:16,434
The German's planned this, Sir.

756
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,865
They've been planning it for months.
They want you to attack.

757
01:39:21,818 --> 01:39:23,800
Read the letter.

758
01:39:43,841 --> 01:39:45,626
- Major.
- Yes, Sir.

759
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:50,800
- Stand them down.
- Yes, Sir.

760
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,915
Call up the orderlies.
Tend the wounded.

761
01:39:53,082 --> 01:39:55,420
- Hold the line in case they counter.
- Yes, Sir.

762
01:39:56,269 --> 01:39:59,117
Stand down! Stand down!

763
01:40:12,386 --> 01:40:15,006
I hoped today might be a good day.

764
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,771
Hope is a dangerous thing.

765
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,072
That's it for now, then next week,
Command will send a different message.

766
01:40:25,776 --> 01:40:27,645
Attack at dawn.

767
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:33,391
There is only one way
this war ends.

768
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:37,970
Last man standing.

769
01:40:43,046 --> 01:40:45,099
Have someone see to your wounds.

770
01:40:47,635 --> 01:40:50,645
Now fuck off, Lance Corporal.

771
01:41:03,886 --> 01:41:05,786
Well done, lad.

772
01:41:06,472 --> 01:41:08,017
Thank you, Sir.

773
01:41:09,936 --> 01:41:12,078
Do you know where
Lieutenant Blake is, Sir?

774
01:41:12,336 --> 01:41:13,975
Blake?

775
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:18,014
There were two of us.
I was sent here with his brother.

776
01:41:20,552 --> 01:41:24,088
Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake
he would've gone over with his men.

777
01:41:24,088 --> 01:41:26,196
He was in the first wave.

778
01:41:27,356 --> 01:41:29,212
How could I find him, Sir?

779
01:41:29,212 --> 01:41:32,753
You can try the casualty clearing station,
behind the line.

780
01:41:34,186 --> 01:41:35,770
Otherwise...

781
01:41:38,803 --> 01:41:40,710
Thank you, Sir.

782
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:05,156
Sergeant, I have to find Lieutenant Blake.
Do you know where he is?

783
01:43:05,156 --> 01:43:06,673
No.

784
01:43:28,066 --> 01:43:31,513
- Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?
- No idea.

785
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:34,523
Move along Corporal.

786
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:38,404
If you can walk,
move to the triage area.

787
01:43:45,694 --> 01:43:47,652
Lieutenant Blake!

788
01:43:59,216 --> 01:44:00,759
Blake?!

789
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:05,718
Has anyone seen Lieutenant Blake?

790
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:58,987
Now come on boys.
He's taken one in the leg.

791
01:44:59,382 --> 01:45:01,158
He's lost a lot of blood.

792
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:03,850
- Lieutenant Blake?
- Yes.

793
01:45:05,447 --> 01:45:07,293
Do you need medical assistance?

794
01:45:08,691 --> 01:45:11,620
No, Sir. I'm from the 8th.

795
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,863
What the hell
are you doing here?

796
01:45:14,712 --> 01:45:16,115
I was sent here
to deliver a message.

797
01:45:16,115 --> 01:45:18,971
The 8th?
You must know my brother.

798
01:45:20,191 --> 01:45:23,490
- I was sent here with him.
- Tom's here? Where is he?

799
01:45:29,889 --> 01:45:34,652
It was very quick. I'm sorry.

800
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:00,732
What's your name?

801
01:46:01,427 --> 01:46:03,493
Schofield, Sir.

802
01:46:06,058 --> 01:46:07,805
I'm sorry, what?

803
01:46:08,168 --> 01:46:13,129
It's Schofield, Sir.
William Schofield. Will.

804
01:46:16,061 --> 01:46:19,658
Well, you need some food.
Get yourself to the mess tent.

805
01:46:34,228 --> 01:46:38,395
If I may, I'd like to write
to your mother.

806
01:46:38,968 --> 01:46:41,342
Tell her that Tom wasn't alone.

807
01:46:44,603 --> 01:46:46,103
Of course.

808
01:46:48,366 --> 01:46:49,918
He was...

809
01:46:51,373 --> 01:46:53,337
He was a good man.

810
01:46:54,858 --> 01:46:57,395
Always telling funny stories.

811
01:46:59,729 --> 01:47:01,923
He saved my life.

812
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:07,480
Well, I am glad
you were with him.

813
01:47:13,450 --> 01:47:15,072
Thank you, Will.

814
