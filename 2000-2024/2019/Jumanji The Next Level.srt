00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:13,082
Leaving this to come see you.

3
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,686
And I can't wait.

4
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,707
Whew.

5
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:47,885
Taxi! Over here.

6
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:56,694
Taxi!

7
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:59,763
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:03,099
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,622
- Gilpin!
- Ahh!

10
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,524
You still on the toothpaste?
Are you on your phone?

11
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:30,393
I'm just... I'm going home
for the holidays tonight, so...

12
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,996
Does it look like
tonight to you?

13
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:34,098
Because to me,
it looks like today.

14
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,233
- Finish the toothpaste.
- Okay. Sorry.

15
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,740
Dad, we're home!

16
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:52,042
I'm in the kitchen!

17
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:54,210
Jan, Spencer!

18
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,913
In the kitchen!

19
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,517
Dad, are you on a ladder?

20
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:01,885
- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.

21
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,352
- What's it look like?
- Get down.

22
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,855
I'm changing your light bulb.

23
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:07,057
I leave for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?

24
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:08,892
Don't think
you should be doing that.

25
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:10,761
You think I can't
change a light bulb?

26
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:13,362
- Okay.
- There.

27
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:15,499
Ugh! No, no, no.

28
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,333
- I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

29
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,368
Hey, kiddo!

30
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:22,539
Hey, how's New York City?

31
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,408
- It's great.
- How's school?

32
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,578
It's okay. How you doing?

33
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,214
I'm terrific. I don't
even know what I'm doing here.

34
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:31,915
You're recovering
from hip surgery.

35
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,417
Meh! I'll be out
of here in no time.

36
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,586
It's not a prison.

37
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,353
I wanna get back
to my apartment.

38
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:40,524
- Is that so terrible?
- Your apartment? It's terrible.

39
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,126
Is it really cold in here?

40
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:44,094
The downstairs heater
isn't working.

41
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:47,531
- The guy's coming in the morning.
- It's like a goddamn icebox.

42
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,933
Did you ever call Milo?

43
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:51,367
What? No.

44
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:53,937
Dad. He's called five times.
Just call him back.

45
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,607
I'm not calling him back.
I don't wanna talk to him.

46
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,744
Come on, I'll help you
with your bags.

47
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,481
Oh, you're staying in here.

48
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:06,483
We're roommates.

49
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:09,452
Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.

50
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:11,655
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- If you want, yeah.

51
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,757
It's a couple weeks.
It's gonna be fine.

52
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,993
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

53
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:18,996
- Oh! You're gonna...
- Whoa!

54
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:23,600
- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!

55
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:28,205
This goes there. There.

56
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,874
That's in there.

57
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:33,010
- All right, let's try it.
- Okay, let's see.

58
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:35,279
All right, so there's that.

59
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,147
There's this. There's this.

60
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:40,584
The blue light, the red,
the green light.

61
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,454
Oh, look at you two.
How sweet is this?

62
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,826
Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.

63
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,794
The heater guy's
coming in the morning.

64
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,130
I'm gonna meet
my friends for brunch at 10.

65
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:54,965
That'll be nice.
Where are you going?

66
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:58,802
- Um... Nora's.
- What are you going there for?

67
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,403
All the restaurants
in Brantford,

68
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:02,506
- you gotta go to that one?
- I didn't pick.

69
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,975
What difference does it make?
It's been years.

70
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,077
I love you, honey.
I'm so glad you're home.

71
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:08,478
Love you too, Mom.

72
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:19,022
Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.

73
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:21,658
You still got
that little girlfriend?

74
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,827
No.

75
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,629
We're not together anymore.

76
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,698
I don't think.

77
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,700
Was it her or you?

78
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,602
- It's complicated.
- Try me.

79
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,605
We'll see
if I can understand.

80
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:39,076
Well, when we
first got together,

81
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,443
we were...

82
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:45,749
sort of different people
than we are now.

83
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,653
I mean, last year was...

84
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,521
amazing.

85
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,523
I was a senior in high school.

86
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,726
I had a girlfriend.

87
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:59,730
Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.

88
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:01,965
Mm.

89
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,868
I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.

90
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,306
I don't know.

91
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:11,440
Long-distance
relationships are hard.

92
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:15,545
I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.

93
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:19,850
Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.

94
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:23,053
Every single day
on every single subway car,

95
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:25,756
there's lots of ladies
in New York City.

96
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,527
And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.

97
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:33,462
This is the best time
of your life.

98
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:35,766
- It is?
- Yes, it is.

99
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,835
So pull it together! It doesn't
get any better than this.

100
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,772
It's all downhill from here.

101
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:33,991
Bravestone.

102
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,181
Hi!

103
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,549
Yay, yay, yay!

104
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:34,117
- Ooh!
- Oh, gosh, how are you?

105
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:37,020
- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:38,555
Ho, ho, ho!

107
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:40,357
- Fridge.
- Fridge!

108
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,858
- Come here.
- Ooh!

109
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:44,461
So we were building houses
for two months,

110
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,030
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica,

111
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:49,466
which was also amazing.

112
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,868
That is so awesome.
I am so happy for you.

113
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,570
That is so cool.

114
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,706
So, "M," that's what
we're supposed to call you now?

115
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,109
You don't have to.
It's just a nickname.

116
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:01,278
One of my college friends
gave me that.

117
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,213
You don't have to call me that.

118
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:05,382
M. I love it. It's so hot.

119
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,884
- Okay.
- But you and Spencer,

120
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:11,721
- you're still not...?
- Yeah. No. Um, we're...

121
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,857
We're still,
like, taking a break.

122
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,227
Where is he, by the way?

123
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:38,115
Eh, Christ.

124
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:40,518
What do you want, Milo?

125
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,352
Nice to see you too.

126
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:48,125
Yes, I'd love to come in
for a cup of coffee.

127
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:49,693
Thanks for asking.

128
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:56,967
You mind if I make some eggs?

129
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,668
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.

130
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,804
Just hurry up.
I don't have all day.

131
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,339
You going somewhere?

132
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:07,512
Have, um...?

133
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:11,414
Have you been in touch
with Spencer much?

134
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:12,782
Yeah...

135
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:16,319
You know what?

136
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,954
Not really, actually.

137
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:21,358
I text him a lot, but
he doesn't always text me back.

138
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:22,759
- I know.
- It's just...

139
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:24,427
I've been crazed lately

140
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:26,763
with, you know,
classes and practices,

141
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:28,465
and I got games
on the weekends.

142
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,636
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

143
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:35,540
I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.

144
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:42,145
Okay, look, where...?
Where is this guy? For real.

145
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:47,585
Good?

146
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:50,588
- Meh.
- What do you mean, "Meh"?

147
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,156
Meh! What do you want already?

148
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,758
You've been calling
and calling.

149
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:57,327
You show up out of the blue
after 15 years.

150
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,096
Why? 'Cause you wanna
make some eggs?

151
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:07,103
You remember
when we first opened,

152
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:10,907
we had that
little dishwasher, Morris?

153
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,809
Yeah, of course
I remember Morris.

154
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:14,844
Worked the dinner shift.

155
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:18,583
Six days a week,
2 in the morning most nights.

156
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:22,752
- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris. Mm.

157
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:25,690
He wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was done

158
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:29,326
with every single utensil
in the bin.

159
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:33,396
Yeah, the man knew his craft.

160
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,032
Little Morris.

161
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,137
Well, get... Wha...

162
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:43,073
Just get to it, would you?

163
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,710
I mean, it's always
the scenic route with you.

164
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:48,546
I know what you want,
you want to apologize.

165
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,648
And I hate to tell you,
I'm not interested.

166
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:54,251
You think I'm supposed
to apologize?

167
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:56,820
Oh, heater guy.

168
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:01,891
- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?

169
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,093
Yes, sir, it's me.

170
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:04,961
Anthony!

171
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:06,229
How are you?

172
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,098
Come on in. Come on in.

173
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,738
- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.

174
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,740
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

175
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,709
Heh, heh. Oh, uh, this is
uh, Martha and-and Bethany.

176
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,544
This is Spencer's
grandfather, Eddie.

177
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:23,213
Martha?
You're the little girlfriend.

178
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:25,048
- Uh...
- Morning!

179
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,417
Morning, sir.
Sorry to barge in on you.

180
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,786
You're not barging.
He's barging.

181
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,756
Milo Walker.

182
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,091
Wait, Milo? Like...
Like Milo and Eddie's.

183
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,926
- Pleased to meet you.
- Man, my dad said

184
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,596
you guys had
the best restaurant.

185
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:41,331
We were just there.
Well, it's called Nora's now.

186
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:44,868
Pfft, Nora's.
It's barely even a restaurant.

187
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,771
It's more like
a breakfast place now.

188
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,340
Were you with Spencer?

189
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:53,109
No, we came here
looking for him, actually.

190
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,345
You all hungry?
Eggs on the griddle.

191
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,280
- Might have to take a look.
- Hey, man,

192
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:59,182
you can do more
than take a look at it.

193
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,117
All right, all right. My man.

194
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:08,358
- Whoa. Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?

195
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:15,298
Martha?

196
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:20,103
Hey.

197
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,840
Where is he?

198
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,885
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

199
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,193
You hear something?

200
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:45,261
It's probably the heater.
It's broken.

201
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,901
How did it
even get here?

202
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,738
I don't know.

203
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,773
Maybe he...
I don't know,

204
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:58,174
maybe he went back for it
or something?

205
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:02,011
Is he trying
to fix it?

206
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,682
Why would anyone
try to fix that thing?

207
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,416
I don't know.

208
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,587
I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?

209
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,589
Okay, look,
I'm calling him again.

210
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:14,759
I'm sure everything's... fine.

211
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:36,112
Fourteen texts
and four missed calls.

212
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,251
I don't think he went out.

213
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,053
I think...

214
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:47,491
I think he went back in.

215
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,795
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...

216
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,995
- What? No. Why...?
- Come on, man!

217
00:15:52,128 --> 00:15:53,296
Why would he do that?

218
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,064
Remember what it was like?

219
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,735
- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!

220
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,637
Guys, guys.

221
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,439
How is he gonna get out?

222
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:06,109
Uh, he's gotta take the...
The green jewel.

223
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,612
And stick it back
in the statue thing.

224
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:09,847
By himself?

225
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:26,564
We gotta go get him.

226
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:28,097
Are you crazy?

227
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:30,433
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?

228
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:33,269
We can do this. We've been
there. We know what to expect.

229
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:35,405
I gotta stop hanging out
with white people.

230
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:36,740
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

231
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:39,409
She's right. We played
before and we won.

232
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,977
We barely survived!

233
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,848
You know
he would do it for you.

234
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,949
For any of us.

235
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:54,959
Be careful.
It looks pretty busted.

236
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,065
<i>Welcome to Jumanji.</i>

237
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:06,369
What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!

238
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:08,304
What?

239
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:12,710
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.

240
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,347
This is not happening!

241
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,624
You guys?

242
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:31,695
No!

243
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:51,916
Am I...?

244
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,050
Is it...? I can't believe...

245
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:56,854
Oh!

246
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:01,357
Oh, it's her.

247
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,392
I'm her.

248
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,067
Spencer.

249
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:13,403
Spencer?

250
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,544
What in tarnation?

251
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,613
Where am I?

252
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:25,248
What the hell is this?

253
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,251
Oh, my God.

254
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,419
Eddie?

255
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:34,925
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

256
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,061
Milo?

257
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:38,562
What on earth? What...?

258
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:40,731
- What the...?
- Oh, my.

259
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:41,932
Wait a minute.

260
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,534
Oh, Lord.

261
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,936
- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?

262
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,138
- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.

263
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:52,408
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.

264
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,911
I certainly am.

265
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:56,179
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

266
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,314
You're the little girlfriend?

267
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,950
- Look out!
- What?

268
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:04,320
- Ah! Oh, oh!
- Oh, Lord.

269
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:07,323
That hurt like a goddamn...

270
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:11,127
- Bethany?
- What? I'm not...

271
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,129
No.

272
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:16,800
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

273
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:18,035
Yo!

274
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:23,007
Oh, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!

275
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,041
Fridge?

276
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,175
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it!

277
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,277
The hell, man?

278
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:31,649
Okay.
Okay, something went wrong.

279
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:32,750
You think?

280
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:38,088
Holy...

281
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,256
Wait. If I'm...

282
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,458
Then you...? Spencer?

283
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,828
Why does everybody
keep calling me Spencer?

284
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:49,500
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.
And that, heh... is Milo.

285
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,035
Pleased to meet you.

286
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,670
What?

287
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,772
Then where's Bethany?
And where's Spencer?

288
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:56,472
I don't know! Okay?

289
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:58,876
The game, it didn't
let us pick our avatars, so...

290
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,844
- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:02,311
Are we dead?

292
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:05,082
You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.

293
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,051
Did I die and turn into

294
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:10,521
some kind of a small,
muscular Boy Scout?

295
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:13,657
- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?

296
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,926
Okay, this is gonna sound
very, uh, strange,

297
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,029
but we are in
a video game called <i>Jumanji,</i>

298
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:23,667
and we are in the bodies
of video game characters, heh.

299
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,669
And we've been here before,
Fridge and I.

300
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:27,504
- Last time, I was you.
- Mm.

301
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:30,239
- Huh?
- We're in a game!

302
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:32,509
We gotta find Spencer
'cause he's in here too.

303
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:34,712
- Spencer?
- Yes.

304
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,580
- He's here?
- Yes.

305
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:38,314
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

306
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,216
Yes. Spencer.

307
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:42,586
- He's here too?
- Yes!

308
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,220
He's here,
and we gotta find him.

309
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:46,724
So it's like
a hide-and-go-seek situation.

310
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,325
I'm not "it."

311
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:50,694
Hm...

312
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:55,766
My hip feels
pretty good now.

313
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,071
Oh, my joints
feel like butter.

314
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:04,775
- Oh, yeah, look at those.
- Wow.

315
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:08,045
Look at these.
Look at what I got.

316
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:11,548
- Uh, we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?

317
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:13,316
I'm the old fat dude.

318
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,586
I came back, and things
actually got worse.

319
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,554
At least last time
I was still black.

320
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,660
Well, look at
this little fella.

321
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,328
Hello there. Heh.

322
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:27,631
Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!

323
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:30,634
- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say now?

324
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:36,774
Hey! Ahh!

325
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:40,110
Get on out of here!

326
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,980
What just happened?

327
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:44,481
What the hell
was that thing?

328
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:54,290
Well, that there
was a hippopotamus. Mm-hm.

329
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:56,226
And they are awfully fast.

330
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,096
Faster than a horse,
if you can believe that.

331
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:02,666
And they've got
an awful ferocious bite.

332
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,434
How about that?
You know, the funny thing is,

333
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,704
I don't remember...

334
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:11,307
knowing much about hippos
until right now.

335
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,843
You're a zoologist.

336
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,647
- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?

337
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,517
Just listen.
This is a dangerous place.

338
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:21,885
Crazy dangerous.

339
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:23,987
But Martha and I,
we've been here before.

340
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:28,357
We know what we're doing. You
gotta stay alert all the time.

341
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:32,496
If I'm near water, I got one eye
on the water, you hear me?

342
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:35,032
You got to have eyes
in the back of your...

343
00:22:39,636 --> 00:22:41,470
Oh, God.

344
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:45,175
What in the Sam Hill
just happened to him?

345
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:53,150
Shut the front door.

346
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:54,651
What the hell
happened to you?

347
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,888
Damn!

348
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:01,992
A plane?

349
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,196
What? Come on! Follow me!

350
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,232
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Follow us.

351
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:18,374
Welcome to Jumanji.

352
00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:20,611
- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.

353
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:22,779
Well, don't just stand there.
Hop in!

354
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,786
Strap in.
There's no time to spare.

355
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:36,159
Dr. Bravestone,
famed archeologist

356
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,061
and international explorer,

357
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:39,863
I'm so glad you've returned.

358
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:42,666
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

359
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,167
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

360
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,435
Once again, Jumanji
is in great peril,

361
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,771
and only you can help.

362
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:49,573
Nigel, we're looking
for our friend.

363
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:52,776
- Have you seen, like, anyone...?
- Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men,

364
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,711
welcome to Jumanji.

365
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:58,447
- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I, uh... I kill guys.

366
00:23:58,582 --> 00:24:00,217
I'm so glad you've returned.

367
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,451
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

368
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:05,055
- What's with this fella?
- My dearest Mouse,

369
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:06,490
surely you remember me.

370
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:08,292
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

371
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:11,395
Hey. Nigel,
I thought that was you.

372
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,597
He's a... Uh, what is it called?

373
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,934
- NPC, a non-player character.
- He's not a real person.

374
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:19,670
He only has a limited
number of things he can say.

375
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:22,306
Mm, my friend Carl
is just like that.

376
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:23,941
Nigel, we're looking
for someone.

377
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:25,509
Has anyone arrived
in Jumanji...?

378
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,277
Jumanji is in great peril.

379
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:30,180
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

380
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:32,582
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

381
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:34,184
Grandpa Eddie.

382
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,586
- Do you have a letter?
- Do I have a letter?

383
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,089
- Check your pockets.
- Why would I have a letter?

384
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:40,657
Nigel here
wrote you a letter.

385
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,426
I didn't get a letter
from this guy.

386
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,328
But we are
in a video game, and...

387
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,330
We're in a video game?

388
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:47,497
We're gonna die.

389
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,566
- We did die.
- Are we in hell?

390
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,068
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

391
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,970
It's detailed
in the letter I sent you,

392
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:55,005
Dr. Bravestone.
You should read it aloud.

393
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:58,008
I don't have a letter! How many
times I gotta tell you that?

394
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,577
Oh, no, Eddie.
It's in your hand.

395
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,680
Where did this come from?

396
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:06,917
You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.

397
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,386
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

398
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:14,825
"Dr. Bravestone,
it is my solemn hope

399
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:18,028
that this letter finds you,
for again..."

400
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:21,798
<i>Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.</i>

401
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,734
<i>Whoa, what's going on here?</i>

402
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,036
<i>It's a cutscene.
It's how we find...</i>

403
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:27,404
<i>I'll explain afterwards.</i>

404
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:29,239
<i>You see, our worst nightmare</i>

405
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:30,741
<i>has come to pass,</i>

406
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,877
<i>for Jurgen the Brutal
has returned.</i>

407
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:37,214
<i>Indeed, that most vicious
Jumanjian conqueror is back.</i>

408
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:39,549
<i>And he's brought with him</i>

409
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:41,486
<i>his savage horde.</i>

410
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:45,355
<i>They descended from their
fortress atop Mount Zhatmire</i>

411
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,494
<i>and made their way south
to the Avian Province,</i>

412
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:52,229
<i>home of the sacred
Falcon Jewel,</i>

413
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:54,631
<i>worn around the neck
of the village elder.</i>

414
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:57,034
<i>The Falcon is
the fertility jewel of Jumanji,</i>

415
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,902
<i>and it has been guarded
by the people</i>

416
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,838
<i>of the Avian Province
for hundreds of years.</i>

417
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:04,141
<i>So long as the jewel
can see the sun,</i>

418
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:07,844
<i>the waters will flow
and the land will flourish.</i>

419
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:15,886
Yeah!

420
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,364
<i>Many brave souls died that day,</i>

421
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,966
<i>but Jurgen got
what he came for.</i>

422
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,402
<i>He stowed the jewel
in darkness,</i>

423
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:34,204
<i>hidden from the sun.</i>

424
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:47,751
<i>A drought befell the land.</i>

425
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:49,953
<i>The crops dried out and died.</i>

426
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:52,222
<i>And if the jewel
is not returned soon,</i>

427
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:54,091
<i>it may be too late.</i>

428
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:55,692
<i>Which is why we called for you</i>

429
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:57,694
<i>and your brilliant associates.</i>

430
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,429
<i>I understand
the enormous weight</i>

431
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:01,798
<i>that this must carry for you,
Dr. Bravestone,</i>

432
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:04,601
<i>how this adventure
is like no other,</i>

433
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:07,204
<i>since it was Jurgen the Brutal</i>

434
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:09,540
<i>who killed your parents.</i>

435
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:14,177
No, no, no, no!

436
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,248
- Huh?
- He killed

437
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:20,283
- Dr. Bravestone's parents?
- Indeed, he did.

438
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:23,753
- When the doctor was just a boy.
- Oh, well, that's terrible.

439
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:26,790
I can't say this enough:
We're in a video game.

440
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:29,494
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal

441
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:31,094
and show it to the sun.

442
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:33,964
He's making his way north
across the desert now.

443
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:36,933
Jurgen the Brutal.
Is that Barbara's boy?

444
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,302
And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.

445
00:27:39,436 --> 00:27:41,304
To wrest it from
the hands of the brute.

446
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:42,973
And if you wish
to leave the game,

447
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:45,408
you must save Jumanji
and call out its name.

448
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:48,912
Excuse me. Who is Jumanji?

449
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:52,449
Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.

450
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,984
Here's your map.

451
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:58,455
Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit.

452
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,423
- Huh?
- I can't land here,

453
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:02,125
so you're going
to have to drop in.

454
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,660
- What?
- No, no. Nigel...

455
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:05,362
- I'll get as low as I can.
- Hold on.

456
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:06,830
- Get ready.
- What do you mean?

457
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:07,831
We don't have parachutes.

458
00:28:07,964 --> 00:28:09,266
Shouldn't we have...? Ahh!

459
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:11,168
- What the hell?
- Good luck.

460
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:13,136
The future of Jumanji
is in your hands.

461
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,138
Why did we take a plane
if there's nowhere to land?

462
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:16,339
And go!

463
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:46,236
The hell, man?

464
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:58,549
Where are we?

465
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:00,317
Where's the jungle?

466
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,219
What are we doing here?

467
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,221
We've got to keep it
together, okay?

468
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:05,690
- "Keep it together"?
- Yes.

469
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:07,224
This is
a whole new thing.

470
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:09,493
Nobody said we'd have to do
a whole new thing.

471
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:12,395
And by the way, what the hell
happened to Bethany?

472
00:29:32,882 --> 00:29:35,418
So, what part of New
Hampshire is this exactly?

473
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,588
We're not
in New Hampshire, Milo.

474
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,624
That's right. Exactly.
Not New Hampshire.

475
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,626
- You're starting to get it now?
- Nope.

476
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:44,227
I don't have the foggiest clue
what's going on here.

477
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:46,396
That guy kept calling me
Dr. Braverman,

478
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,164
which is the name
of my orthopedist.

479
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:50,568
I'm thinking I just had
another hip surgery

480
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,235
and now I'm coming out of it.

481
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:55,305
Hey! Check this out!

482
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:03,481
Okay.
We have to find Spencer.

483
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:06,283
To do that, I think we have
to start playing the game.

484
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:09,052
I'm sure that's what he did.
We find him,

485
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:11,888
finish the game,
and we go home.

486
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:14,424
Ed, you okay?

487
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,327
Would you look at me?

488
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,329
I'm back.

489
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,331
I haven't looked
like this since...

490
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:22,767
Never.

491
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,968
You looked like this never.

492
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,337
What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.

493
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,306
I remember you
when you were younger,

494
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:32,643
and... this is not
what you looked like.

495
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:34,811
I think my eyes
are a different color.

496
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,180
All of you
is a different color.

497
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:41,117
It's a good look on me,
huh? Huh?

498
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:43,521
Okay.
They're headed north.

499
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:45,889
- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.

500
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:49,660
- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now.

501
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:53,764
"Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit."

502
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:56,634
Follow the flame
to the desert fruit.

503
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,268
You know there's
nothing on that?

504
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,603
He can see it,
you can't.

505
00:30:59,737 --> 00:31:01,706
Each place on the map
is a different level,

506
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:04,174
and the levels
get harder as we go.

507
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:06,209
This one is called...

508
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:08,378
"Dunes."

509
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:10,146
No shit.

510
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,685
Who the hell is that?

511
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,792
Oh, that's an ostrich.

512
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:25,730
- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.

513
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:29,500
That is an ostrich.

514
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:32,570
The ostrich
is a flightless bird,

515
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:34,938
one of 60 species.

516
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:39,008
You got the penguin, you got
the emu, and you got the kiwi.

517
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:42,045
Heh, heh, funny thing is,
I don't remember knowing...

518
00:31:42,178 --> 00:31:43,714
You're a zoologist.

519
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:45,882
I was a zoologist last time.
It's important.

520
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:48,184
Maybe if we could get through
this quicker.

521
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:53,223
Well, another thing is, they can
run up to 45 miles per hour,

522
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:56,993
which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.

523
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:59,730
Did you know that?
Fascinating.

524
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:05,101
- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.

525
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:08,371
What else do you know?

526
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,073
Here's another
interesting fact.

527
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:14,077
They have three stomachs.
How about that?

528
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:18,616
Ah! Come on.
Beat it!

529
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:20,383
Don't get so close.

530
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:23,788
Just a bird, okay? Come on,
get moving. Get out of here.

531
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,222
- Anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.

532
00:32:26,356 --> 00:32:28,626
Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...

533
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,728
I said scram,
you stupid bird!

534
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,897
- ...is when threatened...
- Get out of here!

535
00:32:33,062 --> 00:32:34,498
...they attack.

536
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,903
Oh, my!

537
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,606
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Oh!

538
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,241
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

539
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,911
- Yes.
- No. Yes, he died,

540
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:48,779
but he's fine.

541
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:51,816
Did I just kill Eddie...

542
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:53,818
by talking too slow...

543
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:56,887
like he always said
I would?

544
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:12,001
Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?

545
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:16,439
Nurse, I'm gonna need to see
Dr. Braverman right now, please.

546
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,909
I'm not your nurse.
Okay, listen.

547
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:23,246
These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.

548
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:24,682
We each have three lives.

549
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:27,283
You and Fridge
each have two left.

550
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,953
If you lose all three,

551
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,722
listen to me,
it is game over.

552
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:35,960
- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "kaputski"?

553
00:33:36,092 --> 00:33:37,393
Yes.

554
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:38,696
Kaputski.

555
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,068
What the hell is that?

556
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,904
- That's not good.
- Look.

557
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:58,949
Oh, there's one more thing
about ostriches.

558
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:00,016
Oh, no.

559
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:01,217
Say it!

560
00:34:01,351 --> 00:34:03,654
They travel in herds.

561
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:10,293
We gotta get out of here!

562
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:12,963
- Dune buggies, let's go!
- Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

563
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:14,598
- Hey, wait.
- Why am I so slow?

564
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:16,199
Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

565
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:17,968
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie.

566
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:19,803
- Go.
- Do you see the key anywhere?

567
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:22,573
- Okay, how do I do this?
- I've never driven one of these!

568
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:28,344
Maybe under the dash.

569
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,682
- Green button!
- Green button. Go.

570
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:32,683
Go, go, go!

571
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,452
Go, go.

572
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:46,964
Oh, my God!

573
00:34:59,743 --> 00:35:00,844
Go.

574
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,881
You are
a terrible driver.

575
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,783
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

576
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,117
Nobody fine. You... Oh! Oh, oh!

577
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:11,522
Oh, no! Ahh, ahh!

578
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,891
Oh, help! Oh, oh!

579
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,926
Hold on, Eddie.
Please don't let go.

580
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,929
Ahh! Oh! Oh, wow!

581
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,564
Oh, help. Ahh!

582
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:29,740
Help. Eddie. Oh!

583
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:35,079
Beat it!

584
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,346
Get out of here!

585
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:41,685
I think we lost them.

586
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:42,820
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

587
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:00,871
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

588
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:04,842
Oh, no.

589
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,147
- Ahh!
- What do we do?

590
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,983
I don't know!

591
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,489
Get in! Hurry!

592
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,001
Ha! Suckers!

593
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:39,743
- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.

594
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:45,149
- Oh, my...
- Whoa, whoa!

595
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:48,152
- Oh, dude!
- Oh, dear.

596
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:52,723
What do we do?

597
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:53,857
What do we do?

598
00:36:58,294 --> 00:36:59,429
What are you doing?

599
00:36:59,563 --> 00:37:02,833
- Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!

600
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:13,376
- What the hell, man?
- They're flightless birds.

601
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,880
This is a flightless
dune buggy!

602
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:19,717
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

603
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:23,487
No, no, no!

604
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,856
- We're not going to make it.
- We're gonna make it.

605
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:28,058
- No, we're not!
- We're not gonna make it.

606
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,358
We're gonna make it.

607
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,266
We're not gonna make it.

608
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:51,548
That was fantastic. Heh.

609
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:53,249
- Oh, horrible driver.
- Whoo...

610
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:58,555
Yeah, you see that, birds?
You don't mess with the kid.

611
00:37:58,689 --> 00:37:59,957
Right there!

612
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,829
Did you see me?

613
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:07,598
I was incredible.

614
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:09,967
I mean, I saved you,
I saved you,

615
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,538
I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.

616
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:17,641
I was a machine.
I was relentless.

617
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:20,878
- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

618
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:24,114
That's Bravestone.
Okay, check this out.

619
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,618
Oh, goodness.

620
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:30,419
What the hell?

621
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,122
It's your strengths
and weaknesses.

622
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:33,557
I... I mean your avatar,

623
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,593
Dr. Bravestone's,
strengths and weaknesses.

624
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:38,461
"Fearless," check.

625
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:40,998
"Speed. Climbing."
"Boomerang"?

626
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,967
"Smoldering intensity"?

627
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:46,837
- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?

628
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:51,542
There it is.

629
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,712
Ew! Ew! Old man.
Get it together.

630
00:38:55,846 --> 00:38:58,816
Eddie, you okay?
You having a heart attack?

631
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,718
His whole left side is shutting
down. Eddie, look at me!

632
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:04,453
- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back.

633
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:07,991
"Weakness: switchblade."

634
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,494
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

635
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:12,663
Bravestone didn't
have weaknesses last time.

636
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:14,531
Yeah,
bugged the hell out of me.

637
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:16,200
I wonder if...

638
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:24,608
- "Nunchucks"? That's new.
- Damn, that's a good list.

639
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:27,678
Milo, push on your left,
like, chest area.

640
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:30,547
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.

641
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,115
Hey!

642
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:34,318
Oh, I got one too. What...?

643
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,856
My. "Zoology." That's what
you were talking about earlier.

644
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:40,157
- Yes. Exactly.
- Yes.

645
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,892
Your avatar is a zoologist.

646
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:45,829
You know, my nephew Maxwell
is a veterinarian.

647
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,098
- What a fascinating...
- "Linguistics"?

648
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,901
- I didn't have that last time.
- The study of languages.

649
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:53,503
Makes sense.
He studies the entire language

650
00:39:53,637 --> 00:39:55,105
on his way to the point.

651
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:58,374
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

652
00:39:58,508 --> 00:39:59,676
Time does fly.

653
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,377
Okay, let's get it over with.

654
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:07,383
You gotta be kidding me.

655
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:09,853
Well, geometry is...

656
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:11,387
- Is new.
- Yeah.

657
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:13,590
Who wouldn't wanna
be better at geometry?

658
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:15,993
And for weaknesses,
"Endurance."

659
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:19,930
And what else? Let's see,
"Heat, sun and sand."

660
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,601
Shouldn't be a problem.
It's not like

661
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:27,871
we're in the middle of
a goddamn desert or anything.

662
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:30,574
What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?

663
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:31,909
He can read the map.

664
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,944
Easy for you to say,
you got nunchucks!

665
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:37,281
I've been training four hours
a day for six months.

666
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:39,182
Now look at me!

667
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:41,785
Man, it is hot out here!

668
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:46,657
How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?

669
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,392
Okay, okay, okay.

670
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:51,427
I gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

671
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:52,663
I know how to do that.

672
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:54,398
Burpees.
Five burpees, right now.

673
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:55,799
Get it going!

674
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:00,637
- That's one.
- One!

675
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,745
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah, come on!

676
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:13,417
North is that way!

677
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,764
You know, it's, uh...

678
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,900
It's really good
to see you, Ed.

679
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:31,435
I don't wanna hear it.

680
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:33,770
You don't wanna hear
that it's good to see you?

681
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:37,473
- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.

682
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:39,676
We sold our business.
It was time.

683
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,679
- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.

684
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:44,614
Okay? Standing on my feet,

685
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:47,117
serving a hundred plates
a night for 35 years?

686
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,052
I was done.

687
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:51,021
I was ready, man.

688
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,856
I was ready to retire.

689
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,224
I'm done talking!

690
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:10,807
"The Oasis."

691
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:15,212
I guess
that's the next level.

692
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:18,648
Huh?

693
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,952
The next level
of the game.

694
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:23,320
We're in
a game?

695
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,555
Oh. Yes, Grandpa Eddie,
we are in a game.

696
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:26,957
You can't be
serious.

697
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,458
Did you know
about this?

698
00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:30,527
I thought
you were done talking.

699
00:42:42,672 --> 00:42:44,574
- Bethany?
- Yep.

700
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:48,211
- My name's Bethany too.
- Really?

701
00:42:48,345 --> 00:42:50,447
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

702
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:57,387
Sure is, sweetie.

703
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:59,623
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

704
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:04,529
Sure, yeah. Uh, come in.

705
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:06,797
I'm sorry, I just...

706
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,365
I didn't know
where else to go.

707
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,200
No, no, no, it's okay.

708
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,902
I'm glad you came.

709
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:15,238
Do you think you can help me
get the machine to start?

710
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:20,210
That is so dangerous.

711
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:21,445
I know.

712
00:43:23,413 --> 00:43:24,948
But I have to try.

713
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,553
They're my team.

714
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:44,201
So, what exactly
are we looking for again?

715
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:46,203
We're looking
for my grandson, genius.

716
00:43:46,336 --> 00:43:49,606
Okay, "Follow the flame
to the desert fruit."

717
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:53,643
Look.

718
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:56,613
They're here.

719
00:43:56,746 --> 00:43:58,315
Hyenas.

720
00:43:58,448 --> 00:44:01,118
Unusual for
their bone-crushing teeth.

721
00:44:05,055 --> 00:44:06,923
Smoke Stack.

722
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:08,692
Where's there's smoke...

723
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:10,927
There's fire.

724
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,796
- Come on.
- Mm.

725
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:15,465
- Boom!
- You call that a roll?

726
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,867
Not bad at all.

727
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,335
I'll bet you two more!

728
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:21,104
Drinks! Drinks over here!

729
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,272
Another round here!

730
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:23,974
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

731
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:46,029
I thought
you'd never come back.

732
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:50,467
I need to talk to you.

733
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:54,204
Absolutely.

734
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,841
Not here, not now.

735
00:44:57,974 --> 00:44:59,577
Not around them.

736
00:45:05,682 --> 00:45:07,017
Leave me alone!

737
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:12,889
Wow.

738
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:15,725
Fiery.

739
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:17,827
Not a real person.

740
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:20,030
- What'd she say?
- Well, she said she thought

741
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:23,033
I was never gonna come back,
she wants to get together later,

742
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,735
- and we all know what that means.
- Hiyo!

743
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:27,837
It means that she's got
a clue for you.

744
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:30,307
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I got a clue for her.

745
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,042
- You got a clue for her.
- Wait.

746
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:35,078
She's your ex-girlfriend.
She's the flame.

747
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:36,980
- "Follow the flame."
- What?

748
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:50,260
The jewel, it's here.

749
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:08,311
Is that the guy
that killed my parents?

750
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:10,880
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

751
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,720
We lost a good man today.

752
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,556
The very best of us.

753
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:22,425
For Dagfinn...

754
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,761
wasn't just my hyena master.

755
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:27,698
He was my friend.

756
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:30,200
I loved him like a brother.

757
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:34,437
And now he's gone.

758
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:37,240
And his beloved hyenas
are left...

759
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:38,908
without their master.

760
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:44,548
Long live Dagfinn.

761
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:47,551
Long live Dagfinn!

762
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,953
Why did he have to die?

763
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:54,659
He died because...

764
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,893
he made a mistake.

765
00:46:57,027 --> 00:47:00,430
He tried to steal something
quite precious from me.

766
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:04,267
He left me no choice.

767
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:06,303
And now...

768
00:47:06,436 --> 00:47:10,473
I feed him
to his beloved hyenas.

769
00:47:14,444 --> 00:47:16,179
- That's messed up.
- Oh!

770
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,381
I loved Dagfinn!

771
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:22,520
There's none among you
I love as much.

772
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:25,221
And so...

773
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:31,861
The key!

774
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:34,699
It's gone.

775
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:37,934
Thief!

776
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:40,604
I got her. I got the thief.

777
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:42,372
Wait.

778
00:47:42,506 --> 00:47:44,841
- Are you guys...? Wha...?
- Come here.

779
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:47,478
- Catch her!
- Don't let her get away.

780
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:53,283
Trying to steal
the key to my chest?

781
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:56,353
Nope.

782
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,521
Shake her down.

783
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:02,225
I'm sorry, I did it.
It was my fault.

784
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:03,893
I, uh...

785
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:07,897
I just... I don't...

786
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:11,067
I don't know what I was...
Oy vey.

787
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:15,606
Uh, it's like, um...
It's like I'm hyperventilating.

788
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,941
Does anyone have,
like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

789
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:19,777
Or a brown paper bag?

790
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:20,845
Spencer?

791
00:48:20,977 --> 00:48:22,345
Is it really hot in here?

792
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,913
You mean...?

793
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:26,416
- That's him. Right there.
- What?

794
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,587
That ain't Spencer.
Look, I know my grandson.

795
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,821
My grandson's a guy.

796
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:33,858
Did he change his hair?

797
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:36,993
- Cut off her head.
- Yeah!

798
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,062
- Cut off her head!
- Wait, wait, wait.

799
00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:42,432
I just think, uh, maybe
don't cut off my head?

800
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:43,433
- Oh!
- Spencer!

801
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:44,869
- Oh, my.
- Did he just...?

802
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:45,935
Oh, Lord.

803
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,239
That's my Life Alert.

804
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:50,841
I gotta take my pill.

805
00:48:57,648 --> 00:48:58,948
Come on!

806
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:01,786
Spencer!

807
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:03,654
Oh, my God, you're alive.

808
00:49:03,788 --> 00:49:05,656
What are you guys doing here?

809
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,492
What are we doing here?
We came to get you, fool!

810
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:11,629
- Bethany?
- Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

811
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,329
What? So, um...

812
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:15,800
Milo Walker, darling.

813
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:19,302
Milo?

814
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:24,107
- Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
- Grandpa?

815
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,510
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer right here.

816
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:28,978
What are you stealing for?

817
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:31,749
- I'm still me.
- Oh.

818
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:32,817
Hey.

819
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:35,653
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,157
Come on.

821
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:47,130
Let's go.

822
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:59,643
Damn it, I was so close.
I had the key in my hand.

823
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:01,978
- Why'd you stop me?
- Huh? Someone yelled "thief,"

824
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,747
so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

825
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,216
You shouldn't have come.
I had it under control.

826
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:08,786
Did you? It looked like
you just got murdered.

827
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:11,555
I mean, what the hell, Spencer?
Why are you even here?

828
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:13,156
Why did you have the game?

829
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:16,627
We destroyed it
so that this would never happen!

830
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,496
I went back and got it, okay?

831
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:21,832
I don't know
why I did it, but I did.

832
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:24,635
And then last night...

833
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:26,336
I've been in kind
of a weird place,

834
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:28,304
and something
came over me, okay?

835
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,641
And now we're all
stuck here again!

836
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:35,445
I thought that I would be him.
Bravestone!

837
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:37,681
I wanted to feel
like that again.

838
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,653
Like... I could do anything.

839
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:47,558
But instead, I'm, um...

840
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:49,527
Ming Fleetfoot.

841
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:54,063
"Cat burglar,
pickpocket, safecracker."

842
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:55,866
Another better character.

843
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,234
- "Weakness: pollen."
- Yeah.

844
00:50:58,368 --> 00:51:00,571
She's small and crafty
and has allergies.

845
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:01,805
She's basically me.

846
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:04,975
I swear, man, if we survive,

847
00:51:05,108 --> 00:51:07,277
I am gonna kill you.

848
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,113
I just can't believe
you came back here on purpose.

849
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:12,181
I'm sorry. Okay?

850
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,953
I'm sorry.

851
00:51:17,253 --> 00:51:18,454
Wait!

852
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:20,024
Oh, there she is.

853
00:51:20,156 --> 00:51:22,526
- Who?
- My ex.

854
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,127
Okay.

855
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,529
Hi.

856
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:29,767
If my husband knew
I was talking to you,

857
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,036
you'd be dead by morning.

858
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:34,738
Uh, don't tell him?

859
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:37,206
Listen to me,
Jurgen and his army

860
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,208
are returning to his fortress.

861
00:51:39,342 --> 00:51:42,546
There, they will meet
the Brothers Kababik.

862
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,115
He will trade the Falcon Jewel,
and an alliance will be formed.

863
00:51:46,249 --> 00:51:49,753
You must get the jewel
before that happens.

864
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,354
You're our only hope,

865
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,524
so you must hurry.

866
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:56,760
Oh, my.

867
00:51:59,597 --> 00:52:01,197
- Now you must go.
- Gotta go.

868
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:02,733
They're gonna meet
the Brothers who?

869
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,233
The Brothers Kababik.

870
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:06,302
- The Brothers Bababik.
- Shh!

871
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:08,739
- Kababik?
- You must get the jewel

872
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:10,139
before that happens.

873
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:13,677
You are our only hope,
so you must hurry.

874
00:52:21,552 --> 00:52:24,021
I think you should explain it
to us one more time.

875
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:25,689
- Wait a second.
- Oh!

876
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:27,156
What about the desert fruit?

877
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,492
Aren't you gonna
lead us to that?

878
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,494
Now I must go...

879
00:52:30,628 --> 00:52:32,796
before Switchblade
realizes I'm gone.

880
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:36,567
What? Switchblade?

881
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,668
That's his weakness.

882
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:41,639
I love you, Dr. Bravestone.

883
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:45,009
And I always will.

884
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:46,944
That...

885
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:49,145
is my curse.

886
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:54,084
I love you too!

887
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:57,955
Well, she seems
like a nice girl.

888
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:04,662
We need camels.

889
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:08,197
Okay, if we're gonna catch up
with Jurgen, we need camels.

890
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:11,535
And we need to find the desert
fruit, whatever that is.

891
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:14,138
"Follow the flame."
I guess we have to follow her.

892
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,807
You guys follow her,
we'll go steal some camels.

893
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:37,861
Whoa.

894
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:06,255
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

895
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:08,257
Jumanji berry?

896
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:10,828
That's a desert fruit?

897
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,030
I guess.

898
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:17,134
"In the moment of need,
remember the seed."

899
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:19,203
A little bit
of Jumanji wisdom there.

900
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:25,976
There it is.

901
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:33,050
Milo and I will break in
and get the camels.

902
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:35,886
Grandpa, you stay here on
lookout. Keep a low profile.

903
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:38,287
Got it? Low profile.

904
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:40,256
If anyone tries
to enter the livery,

905
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:42,926
just, I don't know,
whistle or something.

906
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,427
Sure thing.

907
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:50,167
That's not when you smolder.

908
00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:52,736
It's not the moment for it.
Forget it.

909
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,437
I did it.
I don't know what it was.

910
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:56,707
Look like your stomach
is upset.

911
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,474
Like you ate something bad.

912
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:02,445
Oh, man.

913
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:05,082
I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

914
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,917
Stealing makes me
very uncomfortable,

915
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,254
which is not ideal
for a burglar.

916
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:34,678
So the fruit
is in the tree.

917
00:55:34,812 --> 00:55:36,013
But you can't get to it

918
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:37,614
without going through
the water

919
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,216
or whatever that is.

920
00:55:39,348 --> 00:55:42,186
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas
or something.

921
00:55:46,023 --> 00:55:47,456
"Follow the flame."

922
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:51,195
I think that's how we get there.

923
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:54,463
But I don't know how
I'm supposed to make that jump.

924
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:57,034
I mean, it's doable...

925
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:59,536
but I don't have
my usual explosiveness.

926
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:03,439
- Ugh!
- Wh... Ho! Yo!

927
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:05,776
Ho, ho, ho! Wow!

928
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:15,652
Yes!

929
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:21,390
Martha! Ho!

930
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,330
Martha!

931
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:27,664
Oh...

932
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:34,004
- Martha!
- Oh, it's really heavy.

933
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:38,075
Ugh! You okay?
Give me your hand.

934
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,375
There you go.

935
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:49,418
Ow. Oh...

936
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:54,091
Wait a second.

937
00:56:54,224 --> 00:56:56,260
- What...?
- The hell, man?

938
00:56:56,392 --> 00:56:58,228
Oh, my God!

939
00:56:58,362 --> 00:57:00,364
- The hell, man?
- Oh, my God.

940
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:05,102
- Fridge?
- Yeah.

941
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,004
Martha?

942
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:08,437
Yeah.

943
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:17,581
Hey, move along.
Nothing to see here.

944
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:18,782
What'd you say?

945
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:20,416
I said, keep walking, pal.

946
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,120
Nothing to see here. Beat it.

947
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:27,391
- What'd you say?
- Beat it, get out of here.

948
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:28,792
What'd you say?

949
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,904
I said, scram!

950
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:52,950
You want a piece of me?
Yeah, come on, come on.

951
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,385
What do you got?
What do you got? Come on!

952
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,755
Come and get it. Yeah!

953
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:04,227
Come on, you bastards!

954
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:08,065
Ha, wow! Ha, ha!

955
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:10,000
Here, camel, camel.

956
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:12,502
Come on, let's go.

957
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:17,274
They are proud and majestic
animals, aren't they?

958
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:23,680
Oh, you're welcome. Heh.

959
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:29,786
Did you...? Were you
just talking to them?

960
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,556
Um, press your menu.
Uh, it's right here.

961
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:36,626
"Linguistics."

962
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,395
You can talk to animals.

963
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:39,529
Yes.

964
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:42,065
It appears that I speak camel.

965
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:43,834
Can you ask them to
come with us and...?

966
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:46,570
Excuse me.

967
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,806
They're willing to talk.

968
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,842
Uh, they wanna know
what's in it for them

969
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:54,311
and how much luggage we have.

970
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:57,848
Will you look at me? Oh!

971
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:00,485
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with this?

972
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:02,052
You read the map.

973
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:04,554
I don't wanna read the map.
I'm supposed to be her.

974
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:07,624
Instead, there's actual hair
growing out of my face!

975
00:59:07,758 --> 00:59:12,062
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful,
even this one.

976
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:13,797
Wait a second.

977
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:23,073
- Oh, this is amazing!
- Careful.

978
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:24,374
Fridge...

979
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:30,113
Yo, this thing is insane!

980
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:31,948
Be careful.
That body is not a toy.

981
00:59:32,082 --> 00:59:33,683
No, it's a machine.

982
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:36,219
And on top of that...

983
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:37,888
boobs.

984
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:39,890
Touch my boobs,
and I will murder you.

985
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:42,359
Too late. It was literally
the first thing I did.

986
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:43,760
Ew!

987
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:48,198
Hey, hey, don't do that.

988
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:50,100
Let's take this berry
and go meet them.

989
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:51,768
Relax, girl.

990
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,037
I'm trying that flying
acrobat thing you did.

991
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:55,739
- Don't. We have the berry.
- Check this out.

992
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:57,407
- It's not necessary.
- Omaha, Omaha!

993
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:59,109
- Hut, hut, hike!
- Wait.

994
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:04,614
Fridge, be careful! I am telling
you, that body's a weapon.

995
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:06,116
You don't know
what it's capable of.

996
01:00:06,249 --> 01:00:07,284
This is amazing!

997
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,119
That body's a loaded gun!

998
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:12,255
Yeah! And this gun's
about to go off!

999
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:14,124
Whoo... Oh!

1000
01:00:14,257 --> 01:00:16,026
Oh, my God!

1001
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:17,794
Fridge!

1002
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:19,296
- Come here.
- Ugh!

1003
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:22,132
Oh, my God.
Goddamn it!

1004
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:24,535
- Here, I got you. I got ya.
- Ugh!

1005
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:38,982
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

1006
01:00:39,116 --> 01:00:41,184
Oh, my God, that was awful.

1007
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:43,253
I hate being the map guy!

1008
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:47,924
Let's get out of here.

1009
01:00:53,797 --> 01:00:55,932
Switchblade! There he is.

1010
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:58,668
Bravestone!

1011
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:01,171
I told you to stay
the hell away from my wife!

1012
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:08,479
- We got company.
- What did you do?

1013
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:11,148
All right, guys, this is
the moment. We need you now.

1014
01:01:14,651 --> 01:01:18,822
Uh, they said that we can
get away out the back door.

1015
01:01:18,955 --> 01:01:21,758
- Are you talking to that camel?
- Yes.

1016
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:23,628
That's Lucille and Hank.

1017
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,428
And Jeffrey's in the back.

1018
01:01:33,136 --> 01:01:34,738
- Hey!
- Hey.

1019
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,075
- We should get going.
- What happened?

1020
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:40,877
My grandpa beat up
45 strangers.

1021
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,013
That woman's husband
is trying to kill him.

1022
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:44,482
Mm.

1023
01:01:44,615 --> 01:01:46,016
Is that the desert fruit?

1024
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:47,652
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry,

1025
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,986
and it weighs like 100 pounds.

1026
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,221
My grandpa will carry it.

1027
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,759
We should get out of here.

1028
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:57,727
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

1029
01:01:57,861 --> 01:01:59,564
- I could take them.
- What?

1030
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:00,897
What? We escaped.

1031
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:03,333
- I said, I could take them.
- Oh, Eddie.

1032
01:02:03,466 --> 01:02:05,468
No, Grandpa Eddie,
that's Switchblade!

1033
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:07,672
I'm telling you,
there's a time when you run.

1034
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:10,073
Then there's a time in life,
like now, where you stay...

1035
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:18,516
Yeah! Yeah!

1036
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:19,916
<i>Switchblade! Switchblade!</i>

1037
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,718
Nice shot, Switchblade!

1038
01:02:29,993 --> 01:02:31,061
- Oh!
- Phew.

1039
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:39,769
What?

1040
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:55,486
We should see
Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

1041
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:01,758
You know, Gladys and I took
a road trip before she passed.

1042
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:04,227
We went on a ceramics tour

1043
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:05,862
through the Southwest.

1044
01:03:05,996 --> 01:03:08,465
I lost my restaurant
so you could drive around

1045
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:10,701
- and look at ashtrays?
- Yes, Ed.

1046
01:03:10,867 --> 01:03:13,236
That's what you do
when you retire.

1047
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,606
You explore your interests.

1048
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,374
I don't have interests.

1049
01:03:17,508 --> 01:03:20,143
Guys like me, we don't retire!

1050
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:22,279
We work,
and then we keep working,

1051
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:24,114
and then, eventually, we die.

1052
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:27,117
But you retired me.
You retired me.

1053
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,654
It's a wonder I lasted
as long as I did.

1054
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:31,888
- What?
- You're a difficult man, Ed.

1055
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:34,124
You don't abandon
your best friend, Milo.

1056
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:37,695
When I lost the restaurant,
I lost everything!

1057
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:38,862
You...?

1058
01:03:40,063 --> 01:03:41,931
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

1059
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:45,168
- Are you talking to my camel?
- Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

1060
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:48,773
And he can tell
that you're a pain in the ass.

1061
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:51,207
My camel's taking your side?

1062
01:03:52,743 --> 01:03:54,779
And he's not your camel.

1063
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,846
He's just giving you a ride.

1064
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,950
Oh! Well, how about the both
of you go screw yourselves?

1065
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,153
- What did you just say?
- Guys!

1066
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:06,590
You and me, we gonna settle
this right here, right now!

1067
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:09,826
- I'll show you.
- What are you doing?

1068
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:12,862
- Don't worry about it.
- Milo, what are you doing?

1069
01:04:12,996 --> 01:04:15,599
Hold on. Wait, wait.
Here we go.

1070
01:04:19,804 --> 01:04:23,273
You want a piece of me, huh?
That's what you want?

1071
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,942
You do not want a piece of him,
Milo, I'm telling you.

1072
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:28,445
Oh, that's where
you're wrong, young man.

1073
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:30,614
'Cause I do want a piece.

1074
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:32,817
I want a big piece.

1075
01:04:32,949 --> 01:04:37,987
See, Eddie, what you don't know
is that for the last 15 years,

1076
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:40,423
I've been studying tai chi.

1077
01:04:40,558 --> 01:04:41,925
And right now,

1078
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:44,327
I am harnessing my chi.

1079
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:47,531
And when I'm done,
I'm gonna whup your ass.

1080
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:50,668
Milo, I am telling you,
this is not a good idea.

1081
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,406
No!

1082
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:04,914
Oh, dude!

1083
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:07,217
You gotta stop
killing everybody.

1084
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:16,861
All right, then.

1085
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:19,730
Well, I guess that's settled.

1086
01:05:32,308 --> 01:05:34,177
The camels just stopped.

1087
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:40,049
This is as far as they go.

1088
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:42,486
To get to Jurgen's fortress,
they said that we can

1089
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,088
head down this path here
and make a right.

1090
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:46,724
Then we're in his territory.

1091
01:05:46,857 --> 01:05:48,224
And they don't wanna
go there

1092
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:51,294
because they
don't want to die.

1093
01:05:51,428 --> 01:05:53,497
We don't wanna die either.

1094
01:05:58,368 --> 01:06:00,838
He's the worst Bravestone
of all time.

1095
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:38,274
So we have to get
across... this.

1096
01:06:41,846 --> 01:06:44,548
Okay, we can do this.
We can do this.

1097
01:06:44,682 --> 01:06:47,016
We have to take our time,
make careful decisions.

1098
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:49,018
What are you talking about?
It's obvious.

1099
01:06:49,152 --> 01:06:50,521
We start on that bridge there,

1100
01:06:50,654 --> 01:06:52,857
then jump to that one
that heads to the right,

1101
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:55,493
and then those look
like two sides of a trapezoid...

1102
01:06:56,861 --> 01:07:00,296
Geometry.
That's what it's for!

1103
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,633
Maybe this character's
not totally worthless.

1104
01:07:03,968 --> 01:07:05,736
- I'll go first.
- Really?

1105
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:12,610
You see? It's no big deal.

1106
01:07:14,645 --> 01:07:15,813
Oh.
What's going on?

1107
01:07:15,946 --> 01:07:17,848
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no.

1108
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:21,685
- No.
- Grandpa!

1109
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:26,790
Ah, crap.

1110
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:29,325
Ah, geez.

1111
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:32,462
What the hell?

1112
01:07:35,866 --> 01:07:37,902
- It's okay. We can do this.
- Yeah?

1113
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:39,737
It's about finding
the right timing.

1114
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,639
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Follow me.

1115
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,546
Come on!

1116
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:50,380
Come on, Milo, come on!

1117
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:55,619
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

1118
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:57,788
- Oh! Oh, Lord.
- Here.

1119
01:07:57,922 --> 01:07:59,422
Oh, okay.

1120
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:06,429
Hey, you guys.

1121
01:08:06,564 --> 01:08:08,599
Is that rock... moving?

1122
01:08:14,004 --> 01:08:16,172
- Oh, no.
- What?

1123
01:08:16,306 --> 01:08:18,509
Well, now, this is a problem.

1124
01:08:18,642 --> 01:08:20,778
- Come on, what is it?
- Oh, my.

1125
01:08:20,911 --> 01:08:22,947
- Spit it out!
- What is it?

1126
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:26,082
- Tell us!
- Tell us! Milo!

1127
01:08:30,521 --> 01:08:32,188
Those are mandrills.

1128
01:08:32,322 --> 01:08:34,457
- We should go. Go, go!
- Go!

1129
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:40,598
That one! Obtuse angle!

1130
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,768
Note the distinctive
and colorful pigment

1131
01:08:44,902 --> 01:08:46,904
around their face and buttocks.

1132
01:08:50,641 --> 01:08:53,309
Mandrills are the heaviest
of all monkeys.

1133
01:08:53,443 --> 01:08:57,815
Even heavier than baboons, with
which they are often confused.

1134
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:02,285
And now head for the rhombus!

1135
01:09:02,418 --> 01:09:04,354
Come on. Hurry up.

1136
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:05,756
- Rhombus! Rhombus!
- Come on.

1137
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:16,600
No, Martha!

1138
01:09:16,734 --> 01:09:18,736
- You're on the wrong bridge!
- What?

1139
01:09:18,869 --> 01:09:20,303
The perpendicular one!

1140
01:09:27,578 --> 01:09:28,746
Martha!

1141
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:36,086
Martha!

1142
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:41,025
No!

1143
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:44,128
No!

1144
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,630
Spencer, behind you!

1145
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,634
Jump!

1146
01:09:50,768 --> 01:09:53,070
Come on, I got you!

1147
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:56,707
Spencer!

1148
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,716
Oh, no! Ow! Ow!

1149
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:18,261
Oh, no! No! Ow! Ow!

1150
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:19,429
Get off!

1151
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:27,971
Come on.

1152
01:10:32,976 --> 01:10:34,712
All right, bring it on.

1153
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,817
Come on, come here. Ha, ha!

1154
01:10:41,852 --> 01:10:43,319
- Grandpa!
- Ow!

1155
01:10:43,453 --> 01:10:45,489
Grandpa! Enough!

1156
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:47,024
- Grandpa, stop!
- Yeah!

1157
01:10:47,157 --> 01:10:48,025
They're gone!

1158
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,029
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

1159
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:00,971
Come on!

1160
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:08,045
Give me your hand!

1161
01:11:08,178 --> 01:11:09,580
- What?
- Trust me!

1162
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:32,136
Oh! Go.

1163
01:11:33,771 --> 01:11:36,607
Last one. Aim for
the center of the parabola!

1164
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,880
Oh, damn. Ugh! Son of a...

1165
01:11:44,615 --> 01:11:46,250
Ow!

1166
01:11:48,585 --> 01:11:51,221
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1167
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:53,490
- Eddie?
- Milo!

1168
01:11:53,624 --> 01:11:56,193
Eddie!
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

1169
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:58,829
I need your help, Eddie.

1170
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:02,431
Eddie!

1171
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:05,602
Oh!

1172
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,643
- Oh!
- Ugh.

1173
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:17,214
Eddie! Milo!

1174
01:12:24,588 --> 01:12:25,956
Oh!

1175
01:12:38,635 --> 01:12:40,671
- Seriously?
- Later.

1176
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:43,439
- Run!
- Run!

1177
01:13:01,457 --> 01:13:02,693
Hyah!

1178
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:19,209
Hey, guys.

1179
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:20,577
Who the hell's this?

1180
01:13:20,711 --> 01:13:23,013
Alex, what are you doing here?

1181
01:13:23,146 --> 01:13:25,215
Bethany thought
you might need some help.

1182
01:13:25,349 --> 01:13:27,818
- Where is Bethany?
- She's right here.

1183
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:29,987
You mean...?

1184
01:13:36,226 --> 01:13:38,427
"Oh, my God, right?

1185
01:13:38,562 --> 01:13:40,898
Like, I'm a total horse.

1186
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:43,867
I can't believe
that we found you guys.

1187
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,702
Hi."

1188
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:48,672
Yep, that's Bethany.
Ha-ha-ha. What's up, girl?

1189
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:49,873
Hey.

1190
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:51,842
Oh, we brought you
some clothes.

1191
01:13:51,975 --> 01:13:53,243
You must be freezing.

1192
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:02,119
So, uh, this horse
is a character in the game?

1193
01:14:02,252 --> 01:14:04,154
Yeah. Cyclone's his name.

1194
01:14:06,723 --> 01:14:08,258
- How's that feel?
- I don't know.

1195
01:14:08,392 --> 01:14:10,260
I sprained it pretty good.

1196
01:14:10,394 --> 01:14:11,795
Where'd you get these clothes?

1197
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:13,997
When I realized how far
north we were going,

1198
01:14:14,131 --> 01:14:15,766
- we stopped to go shopping.
- Ah.

1199
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:17,935
You can shop here?
How did you know that?

1200
01:14:18,068 --> 01:14:20,270
I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

1201
01:14:20,404 --> 01:14:22,339
At least I got rid
of that stupid hat.

1202
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:24,241
Now I got this stupid hat.

1203
01:14:40,524 --> 01:14:42,125
It's something,
isn't it?

1204
01:14:43,593 --> 01:14:45,228
Yeah,
it's something.

1205
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:50,300
You know, Eddie...

1206
01:14:50,434 --> 01:14:55,138
you didn't lose everything
when you lost the restaurant.

1207
01:14:55,272 --> 01:14:57,074
You still got a lot, man.

1208
01:15:01,778 --> 01:15:03,046
I lost my friend.

1209
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:07,384
So did I.

1210
01:15:21,465 --> 01:15:22,833
I'm sorry, Milo.

1211
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,876
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

1212
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:35,480
I should have tracked you down
a long time ago.

1213
01:15:37,748 --> 01:15:40,283
I'm glad you came over
for coffee.

1214
01:15:43,653 --> 01:15:45,522
What made you do it, huh?

1215
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,859
I mean, why now?

1216
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:53,330
Milo, what's going on?

1217
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:00,505
You're sick.

1218
01:16:04,841 --> 01:16:05,842
How bad?

1219
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:09,679
I don't have much time left.

1220
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:15,052
Son of a bitch.

1221
01:16:15,185 --> 01:16:17,754
But I count myself lucky,
Eddie.

1222
01:16:17,888 --> 01:16:20,857
I was married
to a wonderful woman.

1223
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:23,693
I got to live a wonderful life.

1224
01:16:23,827 --> 01:16:26,363
And not everybody
can say that.

1225
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:29,733
That's why I wanted
to make things better with you.

1226
01:16:29,866 --> 01:16:32,202
And now that they are...

1227
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:34,371
well, I'm...

1228
01:16:34,505 --> 01:16:36,173
I'm happy about that too.

1229
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:53,723
Grandpa, Milo.
Come on, we gotta go.

1230
01:17:00,831 --> 01:17:02,199
"The Fortress."

1231
01:17:02,332 --> 01:17:04,434
Looks like
the last level.

1232
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:06,903
Okay, so we, uh,
climb that mountain

1233
01:17:07,037 --> 01:17:08,338
and then we sneak in somehow.

1234
01:17:08,472 --> 01:17:09,973
Yeah,
and then we steal the jewel

1235
01:17:10,107 --> 01:17:11,842
before the Brothers Kababik
get there.

1236
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,678
- And then show it to the sun?
- Sounds like a plan.

1237
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:16,413
What?

1238
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:19,850
I'm sorry, I think I missed
the "plan" part of the plan.

1239
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:23,186
That last level almost killed
us all. I can barely walk.

1240
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,590
Your grandpa beats the hell
out of the wrong guy

1241
01:17:25,722 --> 01:17:28,593
or we get attacked by a bear,
what am I supposed to do?

1242
01:17:28,725 --> 01:17:30,193
I'm not gonna beat up
the wrong guy.

1243
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:31,995
You are gonna beat up
the wrong guy!

1244
01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:33,797
You're not a good Bravestone!

1245
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,500
You're too stubborn
and pissed off.

1246
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:37,000
You keep getting us killed.

1247
01:17:37,134 --> 01:17:38,702
What the hell
you talking about?

1248
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:40,337
And Milo...

1249
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:42,439
And I say this
with all due respect, sir.

1250
01:17:42,573 --> 01:17:44,841
...is not a good person
to be the zoologist.

1251
01:17:44,975 --> 01:17:47,043
He talks too slow,
and by the time

1252
01:17:47,177 --> 01:17:48,812
he gets to the point,
you're dead!

1253
01:17:48,945 --> 01:17:50,280
Once again, no offense.

1254
01:17:50,413 --> 01:17:51,281
None taken.

1255
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:52,983
And let me tell you why.

1256
01:17:53,116 --> 01:17:55,852
- Because my friend Bernard...
- You see?

1257
01:17:55,986 --> 01:17:58,054
You're a thief who's
too neurotic to steal,

1258
01:17:58,188 --> 01:17:59,856
Bethany's a horse...

1259
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:03,860
All I know is,
we are stuck here again,

1260
01:18:03,994 --> 01:18:08,098
we are running out of lives,
and my ankle is killing me! Ahh!

1261
01:18:08,231 --> 01:18:10,100
- Oh, my God!
- Fridge!

1262
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:12,469
Fridge! Are you okay?

1263
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:16,139
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

1264
01:18:29,352 --> 01:18:32,289
That's what the water
looked like at the tree.

1265
01:18:32,422 --> 01:18:33,690
When we...

1266
01:18:33,823 --> 01:18:35,792
Switched bodies.

1267
01:19:17,434 --> 01:19:19,637
- Goddamn, that is cold!
- Oh!

1268
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:23,708
Oh! Oh, man! It's freezing!

1269
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,975
What the hell, man?

1270
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,278
Yes!

1271
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:29,647
I missed you so much.

1272
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:31,649
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

1273
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:34,485
Ahem, Spencer?

1274
01:19:35,785 --> 01:19:37,921
- Hey.
- Hey.

1275
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:44,094
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, what?

1276
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:47,397
Milo?

1277
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:51,835
You should see
the size of your...

1278
01:19:51,968 --> 01:19:55,105
Phew. Damn.

1279
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:57,274
I never thought I'd be
this happy to shrink.

1280
01:19:58,441 --> 01:19:59,644
I have never seen anything

1281
01:19:59,776 --> 01:20:00,844
quite like that before.

1282
01:20:00,977 --> 01:20:02,312
Oh, my God, it's so good

1283
01:20:02,445 --> 01:20:04,649
to be able to talk again
with words.

1284
01:20:04,781 --> 01:20:07,450
- Spencer, hi!
- Hey, Bethany.

1285
01:20:07,585 --> 01:20:09,119
We have so much
catching up to do.

1286
01:20:09,252 --> 01:20:10,621
I wanna hear about New York.

1287
01:20:10,755 --> 01:20:13,724
But it feels like this
isn't the perfect moment.

1288
01:20:13,857 --> 01:20:15,892
Right. Like, later.

1289
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:17,160
Later.

1290
01:20:18,795 --> 01:20:21,599
- Better?
- Yeah.

1291
01:20:21,732 --> 01:20:23,266
Much.

1292
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:29,573
I got hair! Heh, heh!

1293
01:20:29,707 --> 01:20:32,476
For the first time in 40 years.
I gotta go tell Milo.

1294
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,645
- Be careful out there, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

1295
01:20:34,779 --> 01:20:36,146
- How's your ankle?
- Hm?

1296
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:38,181
- Your ankle.
- It's a little sore.

1297
01:20:38,315 --> 01:20:40,250
Not as bad
as you were making it seem.

1298
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:42,118
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

1299
01:20:42,252 --> 01:20:44,988
You were making a big deal
of it. It's not that bad.

1300
01:20:50,927 --> 01:20:52,829
Hey! Get the hell away
from that horse!

1301
01:20:52,962 --> 01:20:54,464
Freeze!

1302
01:20:54,598 --> 01:20:56,132
Milo! Hey!

1303
01:20:56,266 --> 01:20:57,768
Wait, which ankle was it?

1304
01:20:57,901 --> 01:20:59,069
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1305
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:00,671
Get your hands off of me!

1306
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:02,972
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

1307
01:21:03,106 --> 01:21:04,307
I'm right here.

1308
01:21:08,244 --> 01:21:09,714
Guys, guys.

1309
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:12,282
Eddie and Milo.

1310
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:13,350
They got them.

1311
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,359
There's ice everywhere,

1312
01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:24,729
and there's only one road in.

1313
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:28,331
It's covered with guards.
I don't know how we'll get in.

1314
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:30,333
Hm. Whoa!

1315
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:33,103
Oh, okay. I see a dungeon

1316
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:34,572
at the top of this ice wall.

1317
01:21:34,705 --> 01:21:36,940
That must be where
they're keeping your grandpa.

1318
01:21:37,073 --> 01:21:39,543
And Milo is probably
in this, like, barn thing

1319
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:41,679
all the way
on the other side of the place.

1320
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:43,913
Okay. We gotta split up.

1321
01:21:44,047 --> 01:21:46,617
One team goes to get Milo,
the other busts out Grandpa.

1322
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:48,686
But how do we get in?

1323
01:21:48,819 --> 01:21:50,186
Fridge, do you have

1324
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,857
any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

1325
01:21:54,924 --> 01:21:56,893
You mean something like this?

1326
01:21:57,026 --> 01:21:59,563
- Just like that.
- See?

1327
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:01,766
That's why
I'm the backpack guy.

1328
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:03,734
- That's why.
- Yeah. You're great at that.

1329
01:22:03,868 --> 01:22:05,402
Yeah, I know.

1330
01:22:05,536 --> 01:22:08,238
Martha,
will you come with me?

1331
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:10,073
Of course.

1332
01:22:20,216 --> 01:22:23,119
I forgot
what this part feels like.

1333
01:22:23,253 --> 01:22:24,954
It's scary.

1334
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:28,391
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1335
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:31,361
We can do it.
This team can do anything.

1336
01:22:32,929 --> 01:22:34,431
Nobody knows that
better than me.

1337
01:22:34,565 --> 01:22:38,201
- Yeah.
- Come on, you guys.

1338
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:39,537
Bring it in.

1339
01:22:43,406 --> 01:22:44,941
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

1340
01:22:45,074 --> 01:22:46,477
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>

1341
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:47,912
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

1342
01:22:48,044 --> 01:22:50,413
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>
Come on, guys.

1343
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,382
That's not what
I thought this was. No.

1344
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:53,450
We should just go.

1345
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:55,985
Okay, just... Go, team.

1346
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:12,803
Okay.

1347
01:23:12,937 --> 01:23:14,672
I'm gonna try
to sneak in with them.

1348
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:17,741
In this outfit, I might be able
to pass. You guys stay here...

1349
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,543
What? No way.

1350
01:23:19,677 --> 01:23:21,044
Now's the moment. Stay here.

1351
01:23:21,177 --> 01:23:23,514
- Alex, no!
- Go. Good luck, Alex.

1352
01:23:26,684 --> 01:23:27,984
Come on.

1353
01:23:28,117 --> 01:23:30,320
What are you talking about,
"Come on"? Bethany.

1354
01:23:30,453 --> 01:23:31,622
Bethany!

1355
01:23:35,091 --> 01:23:36,961
Turn right.

1356
01:23:53,511 --> 01:23:56,012
You there. Stay where you are.

1357
01:23:56,145 --> 01:23:57,481
Who, us?

1358
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:00,518
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1359
01:24:00,651 --> 01:24:04,320
- Are we the who?
- Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1360
01:24:04,454 --> 01:24:06,055
Yes.

1361
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,391
We are them. It is we. Us.

1362
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:12,428
We are the Brothers Cadabra...
Kadabrik.

1363
01:24:12,563 --> 01:24:14,397
He is one brother,

1364
01:24:14,532 --> 01:24:18,201
and I am the other brother.

1365
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:21,271
We... We got different mothers.

1366
01:24:21,404 --> 01:24:25,709
But we, uh... We came to get
the thing that we came to get.

1367
01:24:28,177 --> 01:24:29,480
Brothers Kababik,

1368
01:24:29,613 --> 01:24:31,381
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

1369
01:24:31,515 --> 01:24:33,817
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

1370
01:24:33,951 --> 01:24:35,853
Ah, thank you.

1371
01:24:54,705 --> 01:24:57,708
There's something
I have to ask you.

1372
01:24:57,841 --> 01:24:59,208
Okay.

1373
01:24:59,342 --> 01:25:02,178
Why didn't you come visit
when you were supposed to?

1374
01:25:02,312 --> 01:25:04,014
You canceled the first time,

1375
01:25:04,147 --> 01:25:06,850
then you were gonna come
for Halloween. You cancel again.

1376
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:08,552
Then the next time
I hear from you,

1377
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:10,554
you tell me
we should take a break?

1378
01:25:13,891 --> 01:25:17,061
It's just... I saw all
your pictures on Instagram,

1379
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:20,096
and you looked like you
were having so much fun, and...

1380
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:23,667
I just got really insecure
or something.

1381
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:27,037
Like I wasn't the guy
I thought I was.

1382
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:29,807
Or I wasn't the guy
you thought I was.

1383
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,241
Which would be even worse.

1384
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:35,579
Spencer,
do you think I'm not...

1385
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:38,616
totally terrified
all the time?

1386
01:25:38,749 --> 01:25:40,618
I got to school,
and suddenly,

1387
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:44,688
for the first time ever,
people really liked me.

1388
01:25:44,822 --> 01:25:46,790
But I'm always thinking that...

1389
01:25:46,924 --> 01:25:49,125
I don't know, like it's...

1390
01:25:49,258 --> 01:25:50,761
Like it's just a matter of time

1391
01:25:50,894 --> 01:25:53,964
before somebody figures out
who I really am.

1392
01:25:54,098 --> 01:25:55,331
But then I see you.

1393
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,203
And you're the person
who makes me feel good...

1394
01:26:00,336 --> 01:26:01,805
about who I really am.

1395
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:06,376
When you're, like,
scared and insecure,

1396
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:09,345
that's when you need
your people the most.

1397
01:26:20,423 --> 01:26:21,324
Hey, Mr. Walker.

1398
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:24,695
Why the long face?

1399
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:29,432
Dad joke. Sorry.
Can't help it.

1400
01:26:31,068 --> 01:26:33,871
Let's get you out of here.

1401
01:27:02,198 --> 01:27:03,399
Okay.

1402
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:05,869
It's just an obstacle course.

1403
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:07,571
You were good at those.

1404
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,823
All right,
all right, get a room.

1405
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,395
Grandpa...
let's get you out of there.

1406
01:27:32,529 --> 01:27:34,565
Here.

1407
01:27:34,698 --> 01:27:37,534
- Unh!
- Whoa.

1408
01:27:37,668 --> 01:27:39,536
Let's blow this joint, huh?

1409
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:41,437
We still have
to find the jewel.

1410
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:44,041
It must be in a vault
or treasure room or something.

1411
01:27:44,174 --> 01:27:46,143
Yeah, that's how
it works in these games.

1412
01:27:46,275 --> 01:27:48,311
I passed a vault
on the way up to this dump.

1413
01:27:48,444 --> 01:27:50,748
Single access,
3-foot-thick steel door.

1414
01:27:50,881 --> 01:27:53,416
Only way in is through
a grate in the ceiling.

1415
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:05,261
Hoo... Oh. Huh.

1416
01:28:05,394 --> 01:28:07,097
I think I got it now.

1417
01:28:09,432 --> 01:28:12,268
Just stay on...

1418
01:28:12,401 --> 01:28:13,604
the raised ones.

1419
01:28:36,727 --> 01:28:39,163
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

1420
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:45,468
So, tell me,
which brother is which?

1421
01:28:47,971 --> 01:28:49,940
Um, how do you mean?

1422
01:28:50,073 --> 01:28:52,943
Which brother is which?

1423
01:28:53,076 --> 01:28:56,312
Which of you is Augustus
and which is Tomatoli?

1424
01:28:57,815 --> 01:29:01,585
Um... I am Augustus.

1425
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:04,855
And I'm Tomatolik.

1426
01:29:06,223 --> 01:29:08,992
Augustus Kababik.

1427
01:29:09,126 --> 01:29:11,327
The cleverest man
in all of Jumanji.

1428
01:29:12,896 --> 01:29:14,798
Yes, I'm totally that man.

1429
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:17,668
- And Tomatoli Kababik.
- That's me.

1430
01:29:17,801 --> 01:29:20,270
The bravest eunuch.

1431
01:29:20,436 --> 01:29:23,507
- Wait a minute, what?
- Did you say, "Eunuch"?

1432
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,310
Tomatoli Kababik,
everyone knows the tale

1433
01:29:26,442 --> 01:29:28,946
of your great
and generous sacrifice.

1434
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:31,181
How you gave your testicles

1435
01:29:31,315 --> 01:29:34,151
in order to save the region
from the floods.

1436
01:29:34,284 --> 01:29:35,686
There might be
a little confusion.

1437
01:29:35,819 --> 01:29:37,420
Of course.
Everybody knows the story

1438
01:29:37,554 --> 01:29:40,991
about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

1439
01:29:41,124 --> 01:29:44,393
- Wherever they may be.
- Wherever they may be.

1440
01:29:44,528 --> 01:29:47,097
All right, let's back up.
Let's go back a little bit.

1441
01:29:47,231 --> 01:29:49,365
- Let's clear some stuff up.
- He's super brave.

1442
01:29:49,499 --> 01:29:51,535
I've always been
the super clever one,

1443
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:53,770
and he's always been
super brave.

1444
01:29:53,904 --> 01:29:56,039
- And super ball-less.
- Stop saying that!

1445
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:58,542
- Both of my balls are right here!
- In spirit.

1446
01:29:58,675 --> 01:30:01,545
- Hey...
- They're here in spirit.

1447
01:30:02,746 --> 01:30:03,914
Always.

1448
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:05,916
Of course.

1449
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:07,951
Right, bro?

1450
01:30:13,223 --> 01:30:15,225
Right.

1451
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:18,128
I got no balls.

1452
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,936
There's the chest.

1453
01:30:26,069 --> 01:30:28,005
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

1454
01:30:28,138 --> 01:30:30,774
- Who, me?
- Yes. You're the cat burglar.

1455
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:33,143
- Huh?
- Your character, Ming.

1456
01:30:33,277 --> 01:30:34,978
- Ming?
- Yes, Ming.

1457
01:30:35,112 --> 01:30:36,513
Your avatar.
That's her name.

1458
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:38,282
In your satchel,
you have lockpicks.

1459
01:30:38,414 --> 01:30:41,051
Lockpicks?
Why would I have lockpicks?

1460
01:30:41,184 --> 01:30:43,452
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

1461
01:30:43,587 --> 01:30:45,555
Don't you think one
of you should do this?

1462
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:47,925
- You have the skills.
- I have the skills?

1463
01:30:48,058 --> 01:30:50,627
Not you. Ming.

1464
01:30:50,761 --> 01:30:52,696
Right. Ming.

1465
01:30:54,364 --> 01:30:56,432
Please don't ask who Ming is.

1466
01:31:06,777 --> 01:31:08,278
Not bad, huh?

1467
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:13,116
Now we just gotta figure out
how to get you out of here.

1468
01:31:23,927 --> 01:31:25,162
Shall we?

1469
01:31:27,764 --> 01:31:29,299
Huh.

1470
01:31:29,433 --> 01:31:30,801
Now, that's cool.

1471
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:38,442
Welcome. May I offer you
a piece of cake?

1472
01:31:39,509 --> 01:31:40,811
No! No!

1473
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:42,446
No!

1474
01:31:46,249 --> 01:31:47,617
No, thank you.

1475
01:31:58,261 --> 01:31:59,563
Steady.

1476
01:32:12,943 --> 01:32:16,747
Ha! I'd like to see
your friend Ming do that!

1477
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:23,854
We got an issue here.

1478
01:32:26,289 --> 01:32:28,058
Oh, thank you.

1479
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:32,429
Thank you.

1480
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:44,141
Brothers Kababik,
I present Jurgen the Brutal.

1481
01:32:54,051 --> 01:32:55,419
At last,

1482
01:32:55,552 --> 01:32:59,022
we meet on this historic day.

1483
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:03,326
Yes, it is so great
to meet you.

1484
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:06,863
Your Honor, if that be
the Falcon Jewel

1485
01:33:06,997 --> 01:33:11,034
upon your thick and meaty neck,

1486
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:13,336
perhaps we should...

1487
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:15,005
take it.

1488
01:33:15,138 --> 01:33:19,409
Today we forge
an unbreakable alliance.

1489
01:33:19,544 --> 01:33:22,012
Your family will join me,

1490
01:33:22,145 --> 01:33:26,783
and land by land,
we'll take the world.

1491
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:30,287
So I ask, on this historic day,

1492
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:31,955
where is she?

1493
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:35,959
- Uh, where's who?
- Who you talking about?

1494
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:37,894
Your sister.

1495
01:33:38,028 --> 01:33:39,696
Soon to be my bride.

1496
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:48,004
You know what? I think that
there's been a misunderstanding.

1497
01:33:48,138 --> 01:33:49,940
Where is your sister?

1498
01:33:52,909 --> 01:33:55,345
Which sister were
we talking about?

1499
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,249
Debbie or... Brooke?

1500
01:33:59,382 --> 01:34:01,318
Or Sierra?

1501
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:05,122
Where is your sister?

1502
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:09,626
She's getting ready,
back at the hotel.

1503
01:34:09,759 --> 01:34:12,129
She's doing what brides do
on their wedding day.

1504
01:34:12,262 --> 01:34:16,166
Hanging with the girls, getting
her hair done, mani-pedi.

1505
01:34:18,735 --> 01:34:21,539
If you come here
without your sister...

1506
01:34:24,307 --> 01:34:26,376
I just might have
to cut off your heads.

1507
01:34:26,511 --> 01:34:28,678
- Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

1508
01:34:28,812 --> 01:34:30,313
- God, no.
- Hey, get off!

1509
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:33,984
- No. No.
- So I'll ask one last time:

1510
01:34:34,117 --> 01:34:37,320
- Getting a mani-pedi!
- Where is your sister?

1511
01:34:37,454 --> 01:34:39,222
I'm right here.

1512
01:34:47,297 --> 01:34:50,467
Gwendolyn Hortencia
Lewelda Kababik?

1513
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:51,602
Is that you?

1514
01:34:51,735 --> 01:34:54,204
Um, yes.

1515
01:34:54,337 --> 01:34:55,472
That is me.

1516
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,108
Now, please,

1517
01:34:58,241 --> 01:35:01,878
O Brutal One,
release my brothers.

1518
01:35:05,115 --> 01:35:07,384
And is it your
intention, on this day,

1519
01:35:07,518 --> 01:35:11,454
at this hour, to wed
Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

1520
01:35:13,123 --> 01:35:15,292
Yep. That's my plan.

1521
01:35:15,425 --> 01:35:18,161
And is it your intention
to mother his children

1522
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:21,298
and forge in blood
this union with your family?

1523
01:35:23,366 --> 01:35:24,401
Yes.

1524
01:35:24,535 --> 01:35:26,537
Gwendolyn Kababik...

1525
01:35:26,671 --> 01:35:28,539
known throughout the world

1526
01:35:28,673 --> 01:35:31,374
for your beauty and cunning.

1527
01:35:31,509 --> 01:35:35,011
And now you're mine.

1528
01:35:38,181 --> 01:35:42,587
Um... May I hold
the Falcon Jewel?

1529
01:35:44,054 --> 01:35:46,756
Of course, my bride.

1530
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:48,559
Thank you.

1531
01:35:50,026 --> 01:35:50,961
Get it.

1532
01:35:54,097 --> 01:35:55,865
Jurgen the Brutal!

1533
01:35:55,999 --> 01:36:00,538
The Brothers Kababik
have been delayed in Gorek.

1534
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,872
These are impostors!

1535
01:36:03,006 --> 01:36:04,709
- Impostors?
- Seize them!

1536
01:36:04,841 --> 01:36:06,644
No, no, no.
Oh, no. We can explain.

1537
01:36:06,776 --> 01:36:07,811
Oh, no, no, no.

1538
01:36:07,944 --> 01:36:09,913
I forgot to tell you one thing.

1539
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:13,484
I have a boyfriend.

1540
01:36:25,762 --> 01:36:27,230
Get back.
Stay back.

1541
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:29,165
- Stay away.
- Get back!

1542
01:36:29,299 --> 01:36:31,268
Get back!

1543
01:36:49,953 --> 01:36:53,790
- Get out of here!
- I will torch you, bitches.

1544
01:36:53,923 --> 01:36:55,992
I will literally
burn your face.

1545
01:37:18,114 --> 01:37:20,317
I'll meet the brothers
in Gorek.

1546
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,485
Kill them all!

1547
01:37:23,987 --> 01:37:25,422
Go get him!

1548
01:37:25,556 --> 01:37:26,590
Go get the jewel!

1549
01:37:26,724 --> 01:37:28,793
Don't worry about us. Just go!

1550
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,128
Backpack.

1551
01:37:34,931 --> 01:37:37,802
Get away! I know geometry.

1552
01:37:37,934 --> 01:37:41,037
I'm not messing around,
you guys. Get away!

1553
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:43,206
Fridge, we're gonna die!

1554
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:56,319
Anybody wanna dance
with the bride?

1555
01:39:02,653 --> 01:39:05,723
You want a piece?
Come on!

1556
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:13,029
Nunchucks.

1557
01:39:25,341 --> 01:39:27,043
Awesome

1558
01:39:32,616 --> 01:39:33,983
We did it.

1559
01:39:34,117 --> 01:39:35,553
Let's go!

1560
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:46,630
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

1561
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:02,345
Whoa! Unh! Whoa!

1562
01:40:08,318 --> 01:40:09,854
Look!

1563
01:40:11,187 --> 01:40:12,857
- Is that Spencer?
- Oh, my God.

1564
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:05,041
No!

1565
01:41:10,781 --> 01:41:11,682
Spencer!

1566
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:13,149
- Oh!
- Oh!

1567
01:41:20,558 --> 01:41:22,860
Who are you?

1568
01:41:28,566 --> 01:41:30,668
I'm Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

1569
01:41:56,026 --> 01:41:58,361
Spencer!

1570
01:42:00,396 --> 01:42:02,766
- He says to get on his back.
- Who, me?

1571
01:42:35,499 --> 01:42:37,467
Oh, no. Milo!

1572
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:38,869
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing?

1573
01:42:39,003 --> 01:42:40,037
Wait.

1574
01:42:41,304 --> 01:42:42,840
Milo!

1575
01:42:51,682 --> 01:42:53,117
Yeah, Milo!

1576
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:55,986
Go!

1577
01:42:58,656 --> 01:43:00,390
We're coming, Spencer!

1578
01:43:04,327 --> 01:43:06,162
"Show it to the sun."

1579
01:43:06,295 --> 01:43:07,598
Grandpa, the jewel!

1580
01:43:07,731 --> 01:43:10,768
You gotta show it
to the sun! Get ready!

1581
01:43:17,306 --> 01:43:19,543
Come on, Milo!

1582
01:43:19,677 --> 01:43:21,812
- Go!
- Come on, come on!

1583
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:37,728
Yeah!

1584
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:50,140
- Call out its name.
- Call out its name.

1585
01:43:50,273 --> 01:43:51,809
Call out its name!

1586
01:43:51,942 --> 01:43:54,645
Jumanji!

1587
01:43:54,778 --> 01:43:57,881
Jumanji!

1588
01:43:58,015 --> 01:43:58,982
What'd they say?

1589
01:44:01,284 --> 01:44:02,418
Jumanji?

1590
01:44:07,558 --> 01:44:08,759
Oh!

1591
01:44:31,347 --> 01:44:34,383
- Oh!
- Yes!

1592
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:36,319
Ha, ha, we won!

1593
01:44:36,452 --> 01:44:38,122
- We did it!
- Hey.

1594
01:44:39,422 --> 01:44:41,492
Put me down.

1595
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,292
- Put me down, goddamn it. Stop!
- Okay.

1596
01:44:43,426 --> 01:44:46,096
Is this what you were
looking for? This little thing?

1597
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:47,831
Grandpa, you guys
were incredible.

1598
01:44:47,965 --> 01:44:51,568
Yeah, that's the thing about
Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

1599
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:52,970
Milo and Eddie.

1600
01:44:54,605 --> 01:44:55,939
Milo and Eddie.

1601
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:05,015
Uh, what are we doing
here now?

1602
01:45:12,055 --> 01:45:13,557
Whoa!

1603
01:45:15,626 --> 01:45:17,494
Well done,
intrepid adventurers.

1604
01:45:17,628 --> 01:45:20,264
You have saved Jumanji.
Again.

1605
01:45:21,598 --> 01:45:23,066
And now,
with your permission,

1606
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,103
Dr. Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

1607
01:45:26,236 --> 01:45:28,972
I will protect it with my life
and return it to the care

1608
01:45:29,106 --> 01:45:31,440
of the elder
at the Avian Province.

1609
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:33,744
And so your work here is done.

1610
01:45:33,877 --> 01:45:37,681
All of Jumanji thanks you. And,
sadly, this is where we part.

1611
01:45:37,815 --> 01:45:39,315
I don't know
what's sad about it.

1612
01:45:39,448 --> 01:45:41,350
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

1613
01:45:45,722 --> 01:45:46,757
What?

1614
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:50,260
Really?

1615
01:45:52,461 --> 01:45:54,463
Hey, guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

1616
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:57,100
What'd he say?

1617
01:45:57,234 --> 01:45:59,468
- He says that he...
- He wants to stay.

1618
01:46:01,404 --> 01:46:05,441
He says somebody's gotta stay
and look after this place.

1619
01:46:05,576 --> 01:46:08,545
And that he's 75 years old
and he just learned how to fly.

1620
01:46:11,849 --> 01:46:14,251
But he won't be able
to get out.

1621
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:16,820
He knows.

1622
01:46:20,657 --> 01:46:22,492
Oh, Milo.

1623
01:46:25,896 --> 01:46:28,866
I feel like I, uh,
just got you back.

1624
01:46:28,999 --> 01:46:30,701
Now I'm losing you for good.

1625
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:36,573
"You're not losing me, buddy.
I'll always be with you."

1626
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,215
Being your partner...

1627
01:46:45,349 --> 01:46:48,952
is one of the best things
I ever got to be.

1628
01:46:51,521 --> 01:46:53,090
He says, "Thank you."

1629
01:46:53,223 --> 01:46:55,025
No, no.

1630
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:57,060
Thank you, Milo.

1631
01:47:25,421 --> 01:47:27,124
Yes!

1632
01:47:27,257 --> 01:47:29,059
- Take care, Milo!
- Bye!

1633
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:30,426
- Go, Milo!
- So long, Milo!

1634
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,229
Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

1635
01:47:35,565 --> 01:47:37,701
That's my partner right there.

1636
01:47:43,607 --> 01:47:46,910
Everybody should be so lucky
to have a friend like Milo.

1637
01:48:02,793 --> 01:48:05,595
Come on, Grandpa. Let's go home.

1638
01:48:10,133 --> 01:48:11,401
Hey, guys.

1639
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:15,939
Thanks for coming to get me.

1640
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:23,680
You do it again, your ass
is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!

1641
01:48:23,814 --> 01:48:25,148
'Cause I'm not coming back!

1642
01:48:48,205 --> 01:48:49,573
Everybody okay?

1643
01:48:51,174 --> 01:48:52,743
Yeah.

1644
01:48:52,876 --> 01:48:54,378
Grandpa,
you okay?

1645
01:48:56,013 --> 01:48:57,748
Yeah, I'm good.

1646
01:48:59,683 --> 01:49:01,752
Holy shit.

1647
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,467
Strike. Square one.
Counterstrike.

1648
01:49:17,601 --> 01:49:19,069
The fat one on the bottom?

1649
01:49:19,202 --> 01:49:21,471
The fat...
No, the fat one above the R.

1650
01:49:21,605 --> 01:49:22,773
- Okay.
- Atop number two.

1651
01:49:22,906 --> 01:49:25,342
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So strike, strike.

1652
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:27,544
- Yeah.
- Counterstrike.

1653
01:49:27,677 --> 01:49:30,347
Then kick me. O.

1654
01:49:34,551 --> 01:49:35,886
Let me tell you something.

1655
01:49:36,019 --> 01:49:39,222
- Getting old...
- I know. Getting old sucks.

1656
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:42,559
Getting old...

1657
01:49:45,695 --> 01:49:47,097
...is a gift.

1658
01:49:49,534 --> 01:49:51,868
I forget that
sometimes.

1659
01:49:52,969 --> 01:49:54,404
But it is.

1660
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:01,111
What more
could a guy possibly want?

1661
01:50:07,217 --> 01:50:09,119
Hey, guys.

1662
01:50:09,252 --> 01:50:11,121
How was your day?

1663
01:50:11,254 --> 01:50:13,623
It was really great.

1664
01:50:13,757 --> 01:50:15,425
Yeah.

1665
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:18,529
Spencer taught me
how to play a video game.

1666
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:34,411
Oh, hell, no.

1667
01:50:46,123 --> 01:50:47,691
You okay, Grandpa?

1668
01:50:50,495 --> 01:50:51,761
Yeah.

1669
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,997
A lot of good memories here.

1670
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:06,676
Eddie.

1671
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:08,513
Eddie, is that you?

1672
01:51:08,645 --> 01:51:10,046
Nora.

1673
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:11,948
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1674
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:12,949
Hey, guys.

1675
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,284
- Hi.
- Hi.

1676
01:51:15,785 --> 01:51:17,187
What's up, bro?

1677
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,890
So how's business?

1678
01:51:20,023 --> 01:51:21,492
Oh, you know how it is.

1679
01:51:21,626 --> 01:51:24,761
My manager quit six months
ago, moved to Philly.

1680
01:51:24,895 --> 01:51:27,464
Place has been kind of
a mess ever since.

1681
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:31,134
It's hard to find people
who really know how to do this.

1682
01:51:31,268 --> 01:51:33,436
Oh, well...

1683
01:51:33,571 --> 01:51:35,506
I don't have to tell you this.

1684
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:37,508
Mm.

1685
01:51:39,009 --> 01:51:40,777
So you need some help
around here?

1686
01:51:42,345 --> 01:51:43,713
You mean it?

1687
01:51:43,847 --> 01:51:45,882
I mean, I...

1688
01:51:46,016 --> 01:51:47,450
I'd be honored.

1689
01:51:47,585 --> 01:51:48,985
Well...

1690
01:51:51,154 --> 01:51:52,989
It's really good
to see you, Eddie.

1691
01:51:54,257 --> 01:51:55,526
Likewise.

1692
01:52:00,197 --> 01:52:01,566
Um...

1693
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:08,905
Um, I'm... I'm gonna take this

1694
01:52:09,039 --> 01:52:11,908
where I was going and...

1695
01:52:12,042 --> 01:52:14,177
I'll be right back.

1696
01:52:14,311 --> 01:52:16,746
You guys gotta come
to New York too.

1697
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,316
Yeah, I can't wait.

1698
01:52:19,449 --> 01:52:21,985
This team, forever.

1699
01:52:22,118 --> 01:52:23,386
Forever.

1700
01:52:23,521 --> 01:52:25,288
Always.

1701
01:52:25,422 --> 01:52:27,924
Uh, always and forever?

1702
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:32,429
- Yeah, let's keep close though.
- Of course, yeah.

1703
01:52:32,563 --> 01:52:34,064
One thing.

1704
01:52:34,197 --> 01:52:35,732
Can we all agree?

1705
01:52:35,865 --> 01:52:37,635
Let's never go back there.

1706
01:52:37,767 --> 01:52:39,736
- We already agreed on that.
- That's fine.

1707
01:53:20,443 --> 01:53:21,845
Sorry it's so late.

1708
01:53:21,978 --> 01:53:23,413
Yeah, it's that time of year.

1709
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:25,915
- Everyone's heaters are broken.
- Oh, it's no problem.

1710
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:27,585
I'm just glad you made it.

1711
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:29,487
The furnace
is right over here.

1712
01:53:34,592 --> 01:53:36,993
Is that
an old video game console?

1713
01:53:37,127 --> 01:53:38,895
Hm?

1714
01:53:39,029 --> 01:53:40,964
Oh, yeah, probably.

1715
01:53:41,097 --> 01:53:43,300
It belongs to my son.

1716
01:53:43,433 --> 01:53:44,901
Hm.

1717
01:53:45,035 --> 01:53:47,505
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

1718
01:53:47,638 --> 01:53:49,472
I've never seen
anything like it.

1719
01:53:54,645 --> 01:53:56,480
Well, it looks like
it's broken.

1720
01:53:57,881 --> 01:54:00,584
Maybe you shouldn't
touch it.

1721
01:54:21,438 --> 01:54:26,438
