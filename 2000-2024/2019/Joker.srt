11
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:33,787
<i>There's no need to wait until somebody
dies or comes down with typhoid fever.</i>

12
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:35,929
<i>It's already a serious situation.</i>

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,339
<i>It's something that affects
almost everyone in the city,</i>

14
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:40,573
<i>no matter who they are
or where they live.</i>

15
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:44,915
<i>You can't go down no one avenue without
seeing nothing but garbage and rats.</i>

16
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:49,122
<i>It's starting to affect my business when customers
can't get in here because of garbage situation.</i>

17
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:51,148
<i>When out there, not just smell it,</i>

18
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:53,068

its terrible.</i>

19
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,447

the very bad smell, it's horrific.</i>

Let's get it.

00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,039
- Yo, what's up with your shoes, bro?
- Nice outfit, huh?

31
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,666
If you're gonna be a clown, at least you
can be a bill-boy, you know that, right?

32
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,356
- Hey!
- Stop it!

33
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,865
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey!

34
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:11,807
- Come on, Kyle, let's go!
- We've got the sign!

35
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:13,250
Let's go!

36
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,017
- Stop there!
- Come on!

37
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:16,708
Watch your go!
Watch your go!

38
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,181
Make me stop, clown.

39
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:21,943
Hey!

40
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,540
C'mon clown, you are not
catching up.

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,264
Stop them!

42
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,027
Come on!

43
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:33,282
- Come on!
- Get out of the way!

44
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,570
Stop them!

45
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:41,146
Hey!

46
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:44,280
You bastards.

47
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,702
Come on, beat his ass up.

48
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,658
Come on, this guy's weak,
can't do nothing.

49
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:56,478
Harder! Harder!

50
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:58,227
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

51
00:02:58,227 --> 00:02:59,640
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on, come on!

52
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

53
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,478
Is it just me,

54
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,323
or is it getting crazier out there?

55
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,170
It is certainly tense.

56
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,214
People are upset.

57
00:04:58,989 --> 00:04:59,998
They're struggling.

58
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,280
Looking for work.

59
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,259
These are tough times.

60
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,465
How 'bout you?

61
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:11,117
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

62
00:05:13,037 --> 00:05:14,045
Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,415
Great.

64
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,762
Did you bring it with you?

65
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:25,604
Arthur...

66
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,323
last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you

67
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:30,044
for these appointments.

68
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:31,669
Can I see it?

69
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:47,239
I've been using it as a...
as a journal,

70
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,649
but also as a joke diary.

71
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:54,813
Funny thoughts or
observations.

72
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:59,333
I think I told you I'm pursuing
a career in stand-up comedy.

73
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:04,877
No, you didn't.

74
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:08,034
I think I did.

75
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:20,172
"I just hope my death makes
more cents than my life."

76
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:39,729
How does it feel to
have to come here?

77
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:41,546
Does it help

78
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,164
to have someone to talk to?

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,165
I think I felt better when
I was locked up in a hospital.

80
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,311
And having thought more about

81
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,698
why you were locked up?

82
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,601
Who knows?

83
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:14,532
I was wondering if you could ask the
doctor to increase my medication?

84
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,024
Arthur, you're on seven
different medications.

85
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,273
Surely, they must
be doing something.

86
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:31,698
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

87
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,877
Can you please stop
bothering my kid?

88
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,494
- Sit!
- I wasn't bothering him...

89
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,012
- Just stop!
- I was...

90
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,284
What, you think that's funny?

91
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,623
I'm sorry, I have a co...

92
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:47,236
"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent
and uncontrollable laughter that doesn't match

93
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,834
how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain
injury or certain neurological conditions."

94
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:55,363
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,857
Happy? Did you check the mail
before you came up?

96
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,264
Yeah, mom.

97
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,138
Nothing.

98
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:47,670
<i>And finally tonight, just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse.</i>

99
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,400
<i>Authorities are saying the city is
under siege by scores of rats.</i>

100
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:54,941
<i>- And not just any rats - super rats.
- More hard to kill.</i>

101
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,099
He must not be
getting any of my letters.

102
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:00,434
It's Thomas Wayne, mom.

103
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:03,456
- He is a busy man.
- Oh, please.

104
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,654
I worked for that
family for years.

105
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:07,836
The least he could do
is write back.

106
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:12,528
Here, all worked up.
Eat.

107
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,974
- You need to eat.
- <i>You</i> need to eat.

108
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,713
How skinny you are.

109
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,516
He will make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

110
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,413
Oh, yeah?
Everybody who?

111
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:32,986
- Who do you talk to?
- Well, everybody on the news.

112
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,528
He is the only one who
could save the city.

113
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:37,569
He owes it to us.

114
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,971
Come, sit. It's starting.

115
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,911
Oh, my!

116
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:48,050
<i>From NCB studios

Thank you.

125
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:27,878
Thank you.

126
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,184
We've got a great
looking audience today.

127
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,282
- Yeah!
- Murray!

128
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:34,309
Wow.
Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,378
Thank you.

130
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,055
So, everybody's heard about the super
rats stutter in Gotham now, right?

131
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:44,569
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

132
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,197
You ready for this?

133
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,836
Super cats.

134
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,753
- But no, serious it is, I mean these guys are...
- I love you, Murray!

135
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,062
I love you, too.

136
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,929
Hey, Bobby, will you
put the lights on?

137
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:04,187
Who is that?
Was that you?

138
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,603
You wanna stand up, please?

139
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,392
Stand. Stand up for me.

140
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,156
There.

141
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,241
What's your name?

142
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:18,228
Hi, Murray.
Arthur.

143
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:19,804
- Arthur?
- My name is Arthur.

144
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:22,738
Ah, okay, well, there is something
special about you, Arthur. I could tell.

145
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,535
- Where are you from?
- I live right here in the city.

146
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,183
With my m... mother.

147
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,315
Okay, hold on. Hold on.
There is nothing funny about that.

148
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,013
I lived with my mother
before I made it. Just me and her.

149
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,726
I'm that kid who's father went
out for a pack of cigarettes.

150
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,577
And he never came back.

151
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:41,126
I know what that's like, Murray.

152
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,968
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

153
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:45,869
I take good care of my mother.

154
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:53,585
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

155
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,798
She does.

156
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,801
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

157
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,833
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

158
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,305
Wow!

159
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,730
I like that. I like that a lot!
Come on down.

160
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,893
Come on! For that,
you've got to come down.

161
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,149
Come on!
Come on!

162
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,041
Come on!

163
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:42,477
Okay, we've got
a big show tonight.

164
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,606
Stay tuned.
We will be right back.

165
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:47,380
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

166
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:50,117
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say, it made my day.

167
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:51,780
Thanks, Murray.

168
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:55,208
You see all this, the lights, the show,
the audience, all that stuff?

169
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,852
I'd give it all up in a heartbeat
to have a kid like you.

170
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,779
You're such a jerk.

171
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:43,247
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

172
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:45,545
Another day in chuckle town.

173
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:50,895
You okay?

174
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,563
I heard about the
beat-down you took.

175
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:56,923
Fucking savages.

176
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:01,137
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should've left them alone.

177
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,779
No, they'll take everything
from here if you do that.

178
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:07,072
All the crazy shit out there?
They're animals.

179
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:13,567
You know what?

180
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:19,880
Here.

181
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,406
What is it?

182
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:24,111
Take it.

183
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,035
It's for you.

184
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,357
You gotta protect yourself out there,

185
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,723
otherwise you're
gonna get fucked.

186
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:37,702
Randall.

187
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,462
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

188
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,444
Don't sweat it, Art.
No one has to know.

189
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:48,991
And you can pay me
back some other time.

190
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:50,665
You know you're my boy.

191
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:56,222
Arthur... Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

192
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,794
Hey, Gary, you know what
I've always wondered?

193
00:16:58,846 --> 00:16:59,932
No idea.

194
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,678
Do you people call it miniature golf,
or is it just golf to you?

195
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:11,577
Punch him in the dick, Gary.

196
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,639
Hello, Hoyt.

197
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,360
Gary said you wanted to see me?

198
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,660
How's the comedy career?
You're a famous stand-up yet?

199
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:36,951
Not quite.

200
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:38,937
Just been working on
my material.

201
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,962
No, don't sit.
This will be quick.

202
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,520
Look.
I like you, Arthur.

203
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,235
You know, lot of the guys here
think you're a freak, but I like you.

204
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:48,601
I don't even know
why I like you.

205
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,659
But I got another complaint.

206
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,276
And it's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

207
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,359
The guy said you disappeared.

208
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,375
Never even returned his sign.

209
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,732
Because I got jumped.

210
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,393
Didn't you hear?

211
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,156
For a sign?

212
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,847
It's bullshit.
It doesn't make sense,

213
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,822
just give him his sign back.

214
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,404
He's going out of business
for God's sake, Arthur.

215
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,452
Why would
I keep that sign?

216
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:16,116
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

217
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,352
If you don't return the sign,

218
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:21,775
I got to take it out
of your pay check.

219
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:24,264
Are we clear?

220
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,723
Listen, I'm trying to help you. Okay?

221
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:30,218
Now I tell you something else.

222
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,399
The other guys, they don't feel
comfortable around you, Arthur.

223
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,966
Because people think
you're weird, okay?

224
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,245
And I can't have that around me.

225
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,272
I want it... I want it to work out...

226
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:31,984
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait!

227
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:35,834
Thank you.

228
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,665
This building is
so awful, isn't it?

229
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:04,305
This building is so awful,
right, mommy?

230
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,731
Yeah, sweetie.
I hear you, GiGi.

231
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,476
It's so awful, mommy.

232
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,691
Right, mommy?

233
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,967
- It's fine.
- This building's so awful, isn't it?

234
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:28,811
Hey.

235
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:36,115
Come on.

236
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,871
Head up.

237
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,528
Maybe the mailman
is throwing them away.

238
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,635
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

239
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,833
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- He's gonna help us.

240
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,769
You worked
for them, what?

241
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,083
30 years ago?

242
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,669
Why would he help us?

243
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,535
Because Thomas
Wayne is a good man.

244
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,719
If he knew how we were living,

245
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,190
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

246
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,949
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

247
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:31,415
I don't want you
worrying about money.

248
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:33,716
Or me.

249
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:37,860
Everybody's telling me that my
stand-up is ready for the big clubs.

250
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,785
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

251
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,916
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

252
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,000
don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

253
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:53,516
Hey, what's your name?

254
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,300
Arthur.

255
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,078
Hey, Arthur.

256
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:59,142
You're a really good dancer.

257
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:01,445
I know.

258
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,962
And who is not?

259
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:04,458
Him.

260
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,418
Happy! What was that?
Are you okay?

261
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:12,742
Mom, what?

262
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,850
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

263
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,296
I'm... I'm watching
an old war movie!

264
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,073
Turn it down!

265
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:25,946
It's hard, mom.

266
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,848
It's nice to see these
couples are at my show.

267
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,044
I have a wife,
we love to role play.

268
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,697
Yes. Yes, very sexy.

269
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:58,647
My favorite one right now is...

270
00:24:58,741 --> 00:25:02,995
professor and senior who really
needs to pass my class to graduate.

271
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:05,283
Yes.

272
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:08,333
So I tell you how I operate.

273
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:11,040
I'm a professor at a prestigious
New England university.

274
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,390
And my wife is a senior in
my intro to western civ.

275
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:21,880
I know, I know, why is she...
why is she a senior in intro?

276
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:23,632
I didn't buy it either.

277
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:26,598
So she comes to me
during my office hours,

278
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,512
Monday and Wednesday
3:00 to 5:00,

279
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:30,406
and she says, - excuse me,
professor Lewis.

280
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:34,336
I can't use my real last name at this
collage 'cause they don't hire Jews.

281
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:39,479
Something I'll address once
I have a tenure, but for now.

282
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,454
She says, - excuse me professor Lewis.

283
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,073
I think I might be in danger
of failing intro to western civ.

284
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:47,729
And I just want you to know I'm
willing to do anything to pass.

285
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:52,078
I said "anything?",
and she says "Aah".

286
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,274
Oh. Hey.

287
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,428
Hey.

288
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:03,633
Were you following me today?

289
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,282
Yeah.

290
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:11,988
I thought that was you.

291
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:15,504
I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.

292
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,883
I have a gun.

293
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:20,470
I'll come by tomorrow.

294
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,412
You're so funny, Arthur.

295
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:29,332
Yeah...

296
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:31,812
You know, I... I do
stand-up comedy.

297
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:34,540
You should maybe come
and see a show sometime.

298
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:36,285
I could do that.

299
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:37,858
Yeah?

300
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:39,857
Yeah.
You let me know when?

301
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:40,887
Yeah.

302
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:51,152
âª If you're happy and you know it,
wiggle your ears âª

303
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:55,563
âª If you're happy and you know it,
wiggle your ears âª

304
00:27:56,847 --> 00:28:01,324
âª Ifâyou're happy and you know it, âª
âª âand you feel it, well, just show it âª

305
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:05,435
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª wiggle your ears âª

306
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,545
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª stomp your feet âª

307
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,120
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª stomp your feet âª

308
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:19,782
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª and you feel it, well, just show it âª

309
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:23,974
âª If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet âª

310
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:28,366
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª shout "Hooray" âª

311
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,628
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª shout "Hooray" âª

312
00:28:33,518 --> 00:28:36,611
âª If you're happy and you know it, âª
âª and you feel it... âª

313
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:40,484
Hoyt, please.

314
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:42,270
I love this job.

315
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:46,888
Arthur, I need to know why you
brought a gun into a kids hospital.

316
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,718
It's a part.
It's part of my act now.

317
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:51,704
That's bullshit!
Bullshit!

318
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:54,173
What kind of a clown
carries a fucking gun?

319
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,864
Besides, Randall told me you tried
to buy a .38 off him last week.

320
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,649
- Randall told you that?
- You 're fuck up, Arthur.

321
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:03,536
And a liar.

322
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:05,102
You're fired!

323
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:39,974
I'm telling you, she wanted my number.
We should have just stayed.

324
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:42,797
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested... at all.

325
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:45,344
Are you nuts? Did you see
how close we were dancing!?

326
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,211
She was in love, bro.

327
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,015
She couldn't wait
to get away from you.

328
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,813
Ryan. Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

329
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,316
Hey. You want
some french fries?

330
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,164
Hello...?

331
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:02,727
- I'm talking to you. Hey.
- No, thank you.

332
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:07,386
You sure?

333
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,316
They're really good.

334
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:15,711
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

335
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:43,905
Is something funny, asshole?

336
00:30:47,742 --> 00:30:49,195
Bitch!

337
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:00,188
âª Isn't it rich? âª

338
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:03,295
âª Are we a pair? âª

339
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,386
âª Me here, at last on the ground âª

340
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:11,445
âª You in mid-air âª

341
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,803
âª Send in the clowns. âª

342
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,751
âª Isn't it bliss? âª

343
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:23,774
âª Don't you approve? âª

344
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:24,930
Please. Don't.

345
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:29,528
âª One who keeps tearing around, âª
âª One who can't move. âª

346
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:32,770
âª Where are the clowns? âª

347
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:36,978
âª There ought to be clowns. âª

348
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:50,382
So, buddy, tell us.
What's so fucking funny?

349
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,944
Nothing. I...

350
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:57,617
I have a...
I have a condition.

351
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:00,000
I'll tell you what you have,
asshole.

352
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:10,119
We've got a kicker, huh? Hey,
hold him steady, hold him steady.

353
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,349
Stay down, freak!

354
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:31,876
No! No!

355
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:34,708
Hey! Help! Help!

356
00:32:58,564 --> 00:33:00,423
Hey!

357
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,968
<i>Stay clear of the closing doors.</i>

358
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,799
I read it was a guy
in a full make-up.

359
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,546
No, it says right here
it was a mask.

360
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:48,742
Either way, I think
it's good for business.

361
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,837
They got clowns in front
of every newspaper.

362
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,771
- Big man, what's the good word?
- Hey.

363
00:36:56,836 --> 00:36:59,228
Hey, Arthur.
I heard what happened.

364
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:00,479
Sorry, mate.

365
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:03,532
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair,

366
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:05,648
you get fired like that.

367
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:09,151
Did you really bring a gun to
the children's hospital, Arty?

368
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,758
What the fuck would
you do that for?

369
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:13,430
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

370
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:15,978
If your dancing doesn't do the trick,
you just gonna shoot yourself?

371
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:19,610
Why don't you ask
Randall about it?

372
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,352
It was his gun.

373
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:24,425
- What?
- I still owe you for that, don't I?

374
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:26,439
What the fuck are
you talking about?

375
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:29,130
Stop talking outta
your ass, Art!

376
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,454
Oh, no!

377
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:38,251
I forgot to punch out.

378
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:12,149
<i>And as our city tries
to make sense of the brutal</i>

379
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:14,296
<i>triple murder on the subway last week.</i>

380
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,157
<i>We're joined by Thomas Wayne.</i>

381
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,681
- Happy, look. Thomas Wayne's on TV.
- He has a personnel connection

382
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,162
- Yes, mother.
- this tragedy.

383
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,216
Thanks for having me on show.

384
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:24,066
They're asking him about
those horrible subway murders.

385
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,614
<i>Thank you, Thomas. I know
this is a difficult time for you.</i>

386
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:29,000
- Why him?
- These young men all were...

387
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,313
Looks like his compaign.

388
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,758
<i>Yes, all three of them
worked for Wayne investments.</i>

389
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,669
<i>Good, decent, educated,</i>

390
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:38,781
<i>although, I didn't know
any of them personally.</i>

391
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:43,973
<i>Like all the Wayne employees,
past and present, they were family.</i>

392
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,725
You hear that! I told you.
We're family.

393
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:49,985
<i>There now seems to be a a groundswell
of anti-rich sentiment in the city.</i>

394
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:54,277
<i>It's almost as if our less fortunate
residents are taken the side of the killer.</i>

395
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,646
<i>Yes and it's a shame.</i>

396
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:58,727
<i>It's one of the reasons why
I'm considering a run for mayor.</i>

397
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:01,089
<i>Gotham has lost its way.</i>

398
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:05,891
<i>What about the eyewitness report of
the suspect being a man in a clown mask?</i>

399
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:08,352
<i>Well, it makes total sense to me.</i>

400
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:11,433
<i>What kind of a coward would do
something that cold-blooded?</i>

401
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,287
<i>Someone who hides
behind a mask.</i>

402
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:18,229
<i>Someone who is envious of those
more fortunate than themselves,</i>

403
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:21,803
<i>yet they're too scared
to show their own face.</i>

404
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:24,680
<i>And until all those kind of
people change for the better..</i>

405
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,043
<i>those of us who've made
something of our lives,</i>

406
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:30,670
<i>will always look at
those who haven't</i>

407
00:39:31,374 --> 00:39:33,115
<i>as nothing but clowns.</i>

408
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:37,937
<i>Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.</i>

409
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,356
It's not funny.

410
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,326
I heard this song on the
radio the other day.

411
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:07,513
And the guy was singing,

412
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,171
that his name was Carnival.

413
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:13,549
- Arthur.
- It's just crazy,

414
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,493
because that's my
clown name. At work.

415
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,060
But until a while ago

416
00:40:23,818 --> 00:40:25,993
it was like nobody
ever saw me.

417
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:30,449
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

418
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:32,988
Arthur, I have some
bad news for you.

419
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,343
You don't listen, do you?

420
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:41,577
I don't think you ever

421
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:43,970
really hear me.

422
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,713
You just ask the same
questions every week:

423
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:49,272
"How was your job?"

424
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,135
"Are you having any
negative thoughts?"

425
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:55,370
All I have are negative thoughts.

426
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,404
But you don't listen. Anyway,

427
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:00,210
I said,

428
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,269
for my whole life

429
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:05,758
I didn't know if I
even really existed.

430
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:08,843
But I do.

431
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:13,762
And people are
starting to notice.

432
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,749
They've cut our funding.

433
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:19,694
We're closing down
our offices next week.

434
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:24,816
The city's cut funding across the board,
social services is part of that.

435
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:27,199
This is the last time
we will be meeting.

436
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:29,327
Okay.

437
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:35,902
They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.

438
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:40,900
And they really don't give a shit
about people like me, either.

439
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:45,774
Oh, fuck.

440
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:56,506
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

441
00:41:59,822 --> 00:42:01,353
Who do I talk to?

442
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,908
I'm sorry, Arthur.

443
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:11,924
I think, uh... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

444
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,310
You know, like, "can I see
myself in this long term?"

445
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:18,441
Is it safe. Is it reliable?

446
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:21,211
Could it kill me?

447
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:24,834
Most guys look at sex like parking a car.
We're like "there's a spot".

448
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,489
"There is another spot,
that would work."

449
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:31,154
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

450
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,557
"Handicapped?
Hope no one sees us."

451
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:40,841
Alright that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

452
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,833
One more time, ya' all.

453
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:53,161
Alright, this next comic describes
himself as a lifelong Gotham resident

454
00:42:53,186 --> 00:42:55,788
who from a young age
was always told that:

455
00:42:55,813 --> 00:43:00,357
"his purpose in life was to bring laughter
and joy into this cold, dark world."

456
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,383
Umm.. okay.

457
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:06,204
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, ya' all. Arthur Fleck.

458
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,944
Hello, it's good to be here...

459
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,121
I hate...

460
00:43:57,242 --> 00:43:59,305
I... I hated

461
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:01,351
school as a kid.

462
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:20,036
I hated school as a...
as a kid.

463
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:24,156
But my mother
would always say, -

464
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:28,405
"you should enjoy it.
One day you'll have to work for a living."

465
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,824
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

466
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,440
Here is one.

467
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,005
You know, I was just
thinking the other day,

468
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:53,723
why are the rich people so...

469
00:45:33,288 --> 00:45:35,106
Do you believe that shit?

470
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,591
Fuck 'em!

471
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:42,134
I think the guy that
did it is a hero.

472
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:48,686
Three less pricks in Gotham city,
only a million more to go.

473
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,799
<i>I know what you're gonna be thinking.</i>

474
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:22,879
<i>And buddy, as always
thanks for the laughs.</i>

475
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:25,632
<i>Sure, will see you again.
You will be here, right? I hope.</i>

476
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:29,858
<i>Tomorrow night,
we have Diana Hudson,</i>

477
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:33,848
<i>Grieg Gordon, and animal
expert Hugh Little.</i>

478
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:36,021
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

479
00:46:36,098 --> 00:46:38,161
<i>Good night. And always remember</i>

480
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,914
<i>"That's Life".</i>

481
00:46:44,187 --> 00:46:45,661
That's life.

482
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,498
Mom, time to wake up.
We go to bed.

483
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,738
No, Happy.

484
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,194
I wrote him a new letter.

485
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:05,210
Come on, dance with me.

486
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,466
For Thomas Wayne.
That's important.

487
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:19,080
You smell like cologne.

488
00:47:19,347 --> 00:47:21,584
Because I just had a big date.

489
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:28,718
Just don't forget to mail it.

490
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,351
You're gonna kill me!
You're gonna give me a hard time!

491
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:07,165
- I won't give you a...
- No! No!

492
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:10,728
I'm not talking to you until
you stop being angry!

493
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:12,113
Okay.

494
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:13,382
Okay.

495
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,457
I'm not angry, mom.

496
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:21,783
I'm not angry.

497
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:23,705
Please.

498
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:28,108
Mom, is this real?

499
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:34,052
He is an extraordinary man, Happy.

500
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:36,816
He is a very powerful man.

501
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:40,016
We were in love.

502
00:49:41,827 --> 00:49:45,458
He said it was best if we would not be
together because of appearances.

503
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,872
And I couldn't tell
anyone because,

504
00:49:52,845 --> 00:49:53,853
well,

505
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:56,238
I signed some papers.

506
00:49:57,148 --> 00:50:00,854
And besides, you can imagine
what people would say about

507
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:02,893
Thomas and me and...

508
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:06,673
what they'd say about you.

509
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:12,593
What would they say, mom?

510
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,053
Hi.

511
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:51,754
What's your name?

512
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,267
I'm Bruce.

513
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,556
Bruce.

514
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,579
I'm Arthur.

515
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:23,232
That's better.

516
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,811
Bruce! Bruce!

517
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:30,336
- Get away from that man.
- It's okay. I'm a good guy.

518
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:32,120
What are you doing?
Who are you?

519
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:33,867
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

520
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:36,600
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

521
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:40,987
- Where did you get him these flowers?
- No, they're not real.

522
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:44,106
It's... magic.

523
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:48,102
- I was just trying to make him smile.
- Well, It's not funny, is it?

524
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:50,676
Do I need to call the police?

525
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,188
No, please.

526
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:55,098
My mother's name is Penny.

527
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:56,641
Penny Fleck.

528
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,360
She used to work here years ago.

529
00:53:58,385 --> 00:54:00,307
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

530
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:03,195
You're her son?

531
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,896
Yeah.

532
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:06,445
Did you know her?

533
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:12,076
I know about the two of them.

534
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,755
She told me everything.

535
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,110
There's nothing to know.

536
00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:22,166
There is no "them".

537
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:24,593
Your mother was delusional.

538
00:54:26,006 --> 00:54:28,062
- She was a sick woman.
- Don't

539
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:29,238
say that.

540
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:32,407
Just go.

541
00:54:33,185 --> 00:54:35,414
Before you make
a fool of yourself.

542
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:40,236
- Thomas Wayne is my farther.

543
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,337
He left me!

544
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,200
Let go!

545
00:55:16,185 --> 00:55:18,419
Keep your respiration's around 15.

546
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:20,819
Slow, there're some stairs
coming up.

547
00:55:20,844 --> 00:55:22,667
Mom?

548
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,357
- What happened?
- Who are you?

549
00:55:25,357 --> 00:55:27,098
- I'm her son.
- Oh, great.

550
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,944
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out to decide.

551
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:31,355
- We don't know what happened yet.
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.

552
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,532
Come on. We have
one more left.

553
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:35,976
I'm getting a little resistence
here. Come on, give her a lift.

554
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:38,131
Position her head.

555
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:39,826
Lift.

556
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:47,313
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:49,996
- Does your mother take any medications?
- No.

558
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:51,389
- Excuse me, I can't hear you.
- No.

559
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,868
- Sir, what was the last time you spoke to her?
- I don't know.

560
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:40,112
Mr. Fleck.

561
00:56:41,407 --> 00:56:43,389
Sorry to bother you.
I'm detective Garrity.

562
00:56:43,414 --> 00:56:45,457
This is my partner
detective Burke.

563
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:48,679
We had a few questions for you,
but you weren't home.

564
00:56:48,874 --> 00:56:51,762
So... we spoke with
your mother.

565
00:56:53,528 --> 00:56:54,537
Oh.

566
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:57,270
What did you say to her?

567
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:58,970
- Did you do this?
- What?

568
00:56:58,995 --> 00:56:59,528
No.

569
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:01,767
No, no. No, we just
asked her some questions.

570
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:03,654
And she got hysterical..

571
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:05,376
Hyperventilating,

572
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:07,060
then collapsed and hit her
head pretty hard.

573
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:09,415
Yeah, the doctor said
she had a stroke.

574
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,282
We're sorry to hear about that.

575
00:57:12,355 --> 00:57:15,026
But like I said, I still has
some questions for you.

576
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:17,889
They're about the subway killings
that happened last week.

577
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:20,128
- You've heard about them, right?
- Yeah.

578
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:22,757
- It's horrible.
- Right.

579
00:57:23,953 --> 00:57:27,112
So with spoke with your
boss over at... Ha-Ha's.

580
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,906
He said you were fired for bringing
a gun into the children's hospital.

581
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,005
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

582
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:35,844
It was part of my act.

583
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:37,886
I'm a party clown.

584
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:40,056
Alright, so why were you fired?

585
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:45,475
They said I wasn't funny enough.

586
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:47,025
Can you imagine that?

587
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:48,906
If you don't mind,

588
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,000
I have to go and take
care of my mother.

589
00:57:52,509 --> 00:57:55,371
Your boss also gave us
one of your cards.

590
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,462
This condition of yours, laughing.

591
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:03,057
Is it real, or some
sort of a clown thing?

592
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:06,431
- "A clown thing?"
- Yeah.

593
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:09,098
I mean, part of your act?

594
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:12,651
What do you think?

595
00:58:18,814 --> 00:58:20,605
It's exit only.

596
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:46,128
She's gonna be okay.

597
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:52,556
I'll get a coffee.

598
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,622
- You want one?
- Yeah.

599
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:11,609
<i>So, the other night I told
my youngest son, Billy,</i>

600
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:14,237
<i>you know, the new one, the...
not so bright one,</i>

601
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,033
<i>I... I told him the garbage
strike is still going on, Billy,..</i>

602
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:20,044
<i>and he says, and
I'm not kidding, Billy says,</i>

603
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:22,304
<i>"So where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?".</i>

604
00:59:29,504 --> 00:59:30,513
<i>And finally,</i>

605
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:33,360
<i>in a world where everyone
thinks they could do my job,</i>

606
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:36,841
<i>we got this video tape from Pogo's
comedy club right here in Gotham.</i>

607
00:59:36,982 --> 00:59:40,969
<i>Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep
laughing, it'll somehow make you funny.</i>

608
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,752
<i>Check out this joker.</i>

609
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:48,531
Oh, no!

610
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:52,192
<i>I hated school as a kid.</i>

611
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:55,373
<i>But my mother would always say,</i>

612
00:59:56,272 --> 01:00:00,128
<i>"You know, you should enjoy it.
One day you'll have to work for a living."</i>

613
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:04,718
<i>"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"</i>

614
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:14,121
<i>You should have
listened to your mother.</i>

615
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,559
<i>And one more.
One more, Bobby.</i>

616
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:19,317
<i>Uh... let's see one more.
I love this guy.</i>

617
01:00:20,823 --> 01:00:21,986
<i>It's funny.</i>

618
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,000
<i>When I was a little boy</i>

619
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,133
<i>and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,</i>

620
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,273
<i>everyone laughed at me.</i>

621
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,668
<i>Well, no one's laughing now.</i>

622
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,658
<i>You can say that again, pal.</i>

623
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:44,689
Alright,

624
01:00:44,714 --> 01:00:46,722
<i>- We've got a great show for you tonight.
- Sure.</i>

625
01:00:46,747 --> 01:00:49,889
<i>here actress Joan Mulligan,</i>

626
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:53,830
<i>and new music from
Melruban and the stiff.</i>

627
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,054
<i>As tensions mount
around the metro area</i>

628
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:05,659
<i>mayor Stokes has pleaded for
cooler heads to prevail.</i>

629
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,852
<i>City services has
been affected</i>

630
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:12,559
<i>and some businesses have decided
to remain closed amid the unrest.</i>

631
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,351
<i>Chuck Stevens filed this report.</i>

632
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:18,260
<i>The anger and resentment that's
been building in the city for weeks</i>

633
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:20,093
<i>seem close to exploding.</i>

634
01:01:20,118 --> 01:01:23,375
<i>Protesters, many dressed as
clowns, took the streets today</i>

635
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:26,918
<i>in one of the several demonstrations
taking on the city's elite,</i>

636
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,864
<i>including a massive rally
outside the Wayne home.</i>

637
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:33,921
<i>What's the point of all this?</i>

638
01:01:34,014 --> 01:01:35,982
<i>Fuck the rich!
Fuck Mr. Wayne.</i>

639
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:37,525
<i>That's what this all fucking thing was
about.</i>

640
01:01:37,713 --> 01:01:39,707
Fuck all this system!

641
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:43,739
<i>Wayne, who recently announced his running
for mayor will be attending the benefit.</i>

642
01:01:44,022 --> 01:01:47,079
<i>You might remember, it was
Thomas Wayne who first referred to</i>

643
01:01:47,105 --> 01:01:50,130
<i>many of Gotam's
residents as "clowns".</i>

644
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:53,180
<i>Today, he offered little
in way of an apology.</i>

645
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:56,459
<i>Well, what I will say is, there's
something wrong with those people.</i>

646
01:01:56,484 --> 01:01:58,898
<i>And I'm here to help them.
I'm gonna lift them out of poverty,</i>

647
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,424
<i>help make they're lives better.
That's why I'm running.</i>

648
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:04,490
<i>They may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.</i>

649
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:22,455
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

650
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,919
- Down with Wayne!
- Down with Wayne!

651
01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:00,366
- Down with Wayne!
- Down with Wayne!

652
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,530
Can I help you, pal?

653
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:11,890
I don't know what to say.

654
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:16,967
Do you want an autograph
or something?

655
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,388
No.

656
01:05:24,892 --> 01:05:26,560
My name is Arthur.

657
01:05:28,029 --> 01:05:29,820
Penny Fleck is my mother.

658
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:32,241
Jesus.

659
01:05:33,082 --> 01:05:34,762
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday?

660
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:37,629
Yes.

661
01:05:38,036 --> 01:05:39,853
I'm sorry I just showed up.

662
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:41,780
Well, my mother
told me everything.

663
01:05:41,907 --> 01:05:43,495
And I had to talk to you,

664
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,382
- you know?
- Look, pal, I'm not your father.

665
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:47,402
I mean, what's
wrong with you?

666
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,630
Look at us.

667
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:55,601
- I think you are.
- Well, that's impossible.

668
01:05:55,981 --> 01:05:58,340
Because you were adopted and
I never slept with your mother.

669
01:05:58,365 --> 01:06:00,018
What do you want
from me, money?

670
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,128
No. I don't want.

671
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,889
- I wasn't adopted.
- Jesus. She never told you?

672
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:06,365
Told me what?

673
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:09,409
Your mother adopted you while
she was working for us.

674
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:11,755
That's not true.
Why are you saying that?

675
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:14,349
Because she was arrested and
committed to Arkham State Hospital

676
01:06:14,373 --> 01:06:15,823
when you were just a little boy.

677
01:06:15,882 --> 01:06:17,241
Why are you saying this?

678
01:06:17,399 --> 01:06:20,648
I don't need you to tell me lies.
I know it seems strange.

679
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:22,226
I don't mean to make
you uncomfortable.

680
01:06:22,251 --> 01:06:24,187
I don't why everyone is so rude,

681
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:26,920
and I don't why you are,
I don't want anything from you.

682
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:29,446
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug dad!

683
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:31,344
How much as a little bit
of fucking decency?

684
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:32,832
What is it with <i>you people</i>?!

685
01:06:33,001 --> 01:06:35,038
Did you see the way
suffer my mother?

686
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,330
- She's crazy.
- She's... huh-huh!

687
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:48,445
- You think this is funny?
- Yeah... huh-huh!

688
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:50,867
Dad, it's me!

689
01:06:51,063 --> 01:06:52,118
Come on... huh... huh!

690
01:06:54,795 --> 01:06:57,260
You touch my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

691
01:07:18,261 --> 01:07:21,060
<i>Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is detective Garrity.</i>

692
01:07:21,085 --> 01:07:23,382
<i>We met the other night
at the Gotham General.</i>

693
01:07:23,547 --> 01:07:25,978
<i>My partner and I had
a few more questions for you.</i>

694
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:29,032
<i>We stopped by your apartment today,
but you weren't at home.</i>

695
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:31,286
<i>Please, give me a call when
you've heard this message.</i>

696
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:33,193
<i>Again, this is detective Garrity.</i>

697
01:07:33,218 --> 01:07:37,244
<i>My number is 212... 99.</i>

698
01:08:19,524 --> 01:08:21,717
<i>Uh, this message is
for Arthur Fleck.</i>

699
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:25,581
<i>My name is Shirley Woods,
I work on the Murray Franklin show.</i>

700
01:08:25,706 --> 01:08:26,980
<i>I don't know
if you're aware,</i>

701
01:08:27,005 --> 01:08:29,921
<i>but Murray played a clip of your
stand-up on the show recently</i>

702
01:08:29,946 --> 01:08:32,994
<i>and we've gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.</i>

703
01:08:33,104 --> 01:08:35,576
<i>And Mr. Murray asked me to
give you a call and see if you're...</i>

704
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:40,832
Who is this?

705
01:08:41,382 --> 01:08:43,290
<i>Oh. Hi, this is Shirley Woods.</i>

706
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:46,034
<i>I'm the show-booker from
Live With Murray Franklin.</i>

707
01:08:46,059 --> 01:08:47,773
<i>Is this Arthur?</i>

708
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,169
Yes.

709
01:08:50,287 --> 01:08:52,212
<i>Hi, Arthur.
Well, and as I was saying,</i>

710
01:08:52,237 --> 01:08:55,944
<i>we've gotten a lot of calls about
your clip, amazing responses.</i>

711
01:08:56,364 --> 01:08:58,447
<i>And, Murray asked if I
would reach out to you</i>

712
01:08:58,472 --> 01:09:00,373
<i>to see if you would
come on as his guest.</i>

713
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:08,343
Murray wants me to come
on the Murray Franklin show?

714
01:09:08,924 --> 01:09:10,468
<i>Yeah. Isn't that great?</i>

715
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:13,135
<i>He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act.</i>

716
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,013
<i>Does that sound good to you?</i>

717
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:22,325
<i>Yeah, that's sounds great.</i>

718
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,991
<i>Can we set up
a date right now?</i>

719
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,799
<i>Are you available next Thursday?</i>

720
01:10:20,268 --> 01:10:21,276
Hey.

721
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:23,263
Wooh. Man.

722
01:10:23,297 --> 01:10:24,785
Sorry about that, my man.

723
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:27,428
All our records that are 10 years
or older are stored in the basement

724
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:30,546
and you're talking about
something' 30 years ago, so.

725
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,763
Can I ask you a question?

726
01:10:33,924 --> 01:10:34,933
Sure.

727
01:10:35,668 --> 01:10:39,047
How does someone
wind up in here?

728
01:10:40,549 --> 01:10:41,717
Have they all...

729
01:10:42,043 --> 01:10:44,023
all the people committed crimes?

730
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,303
Oh, yeah. Some have.

731
01:10:47,683 --> 01:10:51,468
Some are just crazy and pose a
danger to themselves or others.

732
01:10:52,056 --> 01:10:53,622
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

733
01:10:54,105 --> 01:10:55,718
Don't know what to do, you know?

734
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:58,881
- Yeah, I hear you, brother.

735
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:02,188
Sometimes, I don't
know what to do.

736
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,008
Last time I ended up taking
it out on some people.

737
01:11:08,275 --> 01:11:11,418
I thought it was gonna bother me
but, it really hasn't.

738
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:14,343
What's that?

739
01:11:15,373 --> 01:11:16,749
I fucked up.

740
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,990
I've done some bad shit.

741
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:21,708
Um...

742
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:23,980
You know what
I'm talking about.

743
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,331
It's so hard just to try and be

744
01:11:27,557 --> 01:11:29,809
happy all the time.

745
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:33,398
Hey, um, listen, man...

746
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:35,664
I'm just an
administrative assistant.

747
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:38,438
Like a clerk, you know.
All I do is file paperwork,

748
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,281
I don't know what to tell you,

749
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,037
but you should see somebody.

750
01:11:44,404 --> 01:11:45,843
They have programs,

751
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,436
city services, stuff like that.

752
01:11:48,518 --> 01:11:49,727
Oh, yeah.

753
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:51,623
They cut all those.

754
01:11:56,509 --> 01:11:58,090
All right.
Here it is.

755
01:11:58,175 --> 01:12:01,140
Fleck. Penny Fleck. I see.

756
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:05,115
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner...

757
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:08,049
Oh, the patient suffers from

758
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,598
delusional psychosis

759
01:12:10,654 --> 01:12:14,025
and narcissistic
personality disorder... hm.

760
01:12:14,637 --> 01:12:16,898
Was found guilty of
endangering the welfare

761
01:12:16,923 --> 01:12:19,845
of her own child...

762
01:12:27,897 --> 01:12:28,967
What?

763
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:33,849
You said she's your mother?

764
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:43,630
I'm sorry, man. Like I said, I can't
release these records, you know,

765
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:47,142
without the proper forms.
I... I could get in trouble.

766
01:12:48,332 --> 01:12:51,285
Look, if you wanna bring your mom in
here to sign, that would be much easier,

767
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,898
but, I can't... I can't let this go
without a signature, okay?

768
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:56,041
I'm sorry.

769
01:12:59,681 --> 01:13:00,808
No, man!

770
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:04,610
Come on, man! Give it to me!

771
01:13:05,376 --> 01:13:07,267
Hey! Hey!

772
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:08,966
<i>We went over this, Penny.</i>

773
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:10,526
<i>You adopted him.</i>

774
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,526
<i>We have all the
paperwork right here.</i>

775
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:14,399
<i>That's not true.</i>

776
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,913
Thomas had them
all made up,

777
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:20,161
so it stayed our secret.

778
01:14:22,338 --> 01:14:24,207
<i>You also stood by</i>

779
01:14:25,355 --> 01:14:27,936
as one of your boyfriends
repeatedly abused

780
01:14:28,724 --> 01:14:30,462
your adopted son

781
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:33,151
and battered you.

782
01:14:52,097 --> 01:14:53,480
Penny,

783
01:14:54,373 --> 01:14:57,375
your son was found
tied to a radiator

784
01:14:58,307 --> 01:14:59,933
in your filthy apartment,

785
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:03,300
malnourished, with multiple
bruises across his body

786
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:05,419
and severe trauma to his head.

787
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:09,111
I never heard him crying.

788
01:15:10,063 --> 01:15:13,079
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

789
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:16,370
Shh... it's time for bed.

790
01:17:19,773 --> 01:17:21,163
Oh, my god!

791
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,141
What are you doing in here?

792
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,435
You're in the wrong apartment.

793
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,664
Your name is Arthur, right?

794
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,882
You live down the hall.

795
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,633
I really need you to leave.

796
01:17:46,785 --> 01:17:49,072
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

797
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:56,041
Please.

798
01:17:58,602 --> 01:18:00,434
I've had a bad day.

799
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,507
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

800
01:19:54,174 --> 01:19:55,506
Hi, Penny.

801
01:19:57,838 --> 01:19:59,550
Penny Fleck.

802
01:20:07,253 --> 01:20:09,068
I always hated that name.

803
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:14,109
You know, you used to tell me

804
01:20:16,524 --> 01:20:17,892
that my laugh

805
01:20:18,002 --> 01:20:19,399
was a condition,

806
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,709
that there are
something wrong with me.

807
01:20:25,732 --> 01:20:27,186
There isn't.

808
01:20:29,613 --> 01:20:30,973
That's the real me.

809
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,637
Ha... appy

810
01:20:35,424 --> 01:20:36,433
"Happy".

811
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:38,498
Funny.

812
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:42,736
I haven't been happy

813
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:46,199
for one minute of my
entire fucking life.

814
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:54,709
You know what's funny?

815
01:20:57,178 --> 01:20:59,067
You know what really
makes me laugh?

816
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,896
I used to think that
my life was a tragedy,

817
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,159
but now I realize

818
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:08,809
that's a fucking comedy.

819
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:22,342
<i>A very fine actor.</i>

820
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:24,976
<i>He's got a new movie
called 'American Playboy',</i>

821
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:28,525
<i>opening this week across the country.
Will you please welcome</i>

822
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:31,250
<i>a good friend of the
show, Mr. Ethan Chase.</i>

823
01:22:50,885 --> 01:22:52,934
<i>Good to see you, Ethan.
You looking great.</i>

824
01:22:52,959 --> 01:22:54,483
<i>Thank you very much.
You look good yourself.</i>

825
01:22:54,508 --> 01:22:55,517
<i>Ah, can't complain.</i>

826
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,330
Hi, Murray,
Thank so much for having...

827
01:22:59,762 --> 01:23:00,770
Hey, Murray.

828
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:02,928
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

829
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:05,370
It's been a lifetime
dream of mine.

830
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,062
<i>I'm nervous right now.</i>

831
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:12,234
<i>- What?
- I am.</i>

832
01:23:12,828 --> 01:23:14,472
Hey, Murray.
I've been a...

833
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:15,909
That's...

834
01:23:28,441 --> 01:23:30,102
I'm sorry, what's that?

835
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:32,898
Oh, that's really funny, Murray.

836
01:23:34,108 --> 01:23:36,095
You know, I'm also a comedian.

837
01:23:36,368 --> 01:23:37,958
Would you like to hear a joke?

838
01:23:38,777 --> 01:23:40,807
Yeah?
All of you?

839
01:23:41,944 --> 01:23:43,327
Okay.

840
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:47,924
Knock.
Knock-knock.

841
01:24:01,477 --> 01:24:02,883
Knock-knock.

842
01:24:24,429 --> 01:24:27,512
âª - That's life âª
âª - (that's life) âª

843
01:24:27,537 --> 01:24:30,262
âª That's what âª
âª all the people say âª

844
01:24:31,796 --> 01:24:34,544
âª You're riding high in April âª

845
01:24:34,989 --> 01:24:37,269
âª Shot down in May âª

846
01:24:37,476 --> 01:24:41,793
âª But I know I'm gonna âª
âª change that tune âª

847
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:48,258
âª When I'm back on top, âª
âª back on top in June âª

848
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:53,462
âª - I said, that's life âª
âª - (that's life) âª

849
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,113
âª And as funny as it may seem âª

850
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:59,795
âª Some people get their kicks âª

851
01:25:00,323 --> 01:25:02,429
âª Stompin' on a dream âª

852
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:06,954
âª But I don't let it, âª
âª let it get me down âª

853
01:25:08,919 --> 01:25:13,471
âª 'Cause this fine old world âª
âª it keeps spinnin' around âª

854
01:25:14,383 --> 01:25:17,696
âª I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate âª

855
01:25:17,817 --> 01:25:21,081
âª A poet, a pawn and a king âª

856
01:25:21,392 --> 01:25:25,078
âª I've been up and down âª
âª and over and out âª

857
01:25:25,267 --> 01:25:27,542
âª And I know one thing âª

858
01:25:27,567 --> 01:25:31,200
âª Each time I find myself âª

859
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,596
âª Flat on my face âª

860
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:40,163
âª I pick myself up and
get back in the race âª

861
01:25:40,197 --> 01:25:42,950
âª - That's life âª
âª - (that's life) âª

862
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:45,328
âª I tell ya, I can't deny it âª

863
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,749
âª I thought of quitting, baby âª

864
01:25:50,602 --> 01:25:52,879
âª But my heart just ain't gonna buy it âª

865
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:57,712
âª And if I didn't think âª
âª it was worth one single try âª

866
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,902
Coming!

867
01:26:01,994 --> 01:26:05,247
âª I'd jump right on âª
âª a big bird and then I'd fly âª

868
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:13,944
Hey, Arthur.

869
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:15,554
How's it going?

870
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:17,343
Oh, hi, guys.

871
01:26:18,012 --> 01:26:19,268
Come on in.

872
01:26:19,987 --> 01:26:21,562
Did you, uh,
get a new gig?

873
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,649
No.

874
01:26:23,296 --> 01:26:25,940
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

875
01:26:26,302 --> 01:26:28,155
I hear It's gonna be nuts.

876
01:26:28,256 --> 01:26:29,733
Is it today?

877
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:31,642
Yeah.

878
01:26:32,515 --> 01:26:34,050
What's with the make-up, then?

879
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:36,876
My mom died.

880
01:26:36,903 --> 01:26:38,203
I'm celebrating.

881
01:26:38,831 --> 01:26:42,146
Right. Uh.. we heard. That's...
That's why we came by. Figured...

882
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,419
uh, you could use
some cheering up.

883
01:26:44,419 --> 01:26:45,767
Oh, that's sweet.

884
01:26:46,085 --> 01:26:47,768
But, no.

885
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:49,297
I feel good.

886
01:26:49,654 --> 01:26:51,306
I stopped taking
my medication.

887
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:53,183
I feel lot better now.

888
01:26:55,145 --> 01:26:56,510
Oh, okay.

889
01:26:56,677 --> 01:26:57,867
Well, good for you.

890
01:27:00,907 --> 01:27:03,939
So, hey, listen. Uh, I don't
know if you're heard, but..

891
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,678
The cops had been calling
around the shop

892
01:27:06,905 --> 01:27:08,983
talking all the guys about

893
01:27:09,347 --> 01:27:11,668
those subway murders.

894
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,285
They didn't talk to me.

895
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:16,984
That's because the suspect
was a regular sized person.

896
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,658
If it was a fucking midget
you'd be in jail right now.

897
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:27,151
Anyway, um...

898
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:29,133
Hoyt said that, um...

899
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,000
they talked to you and

900
01:27:31,184 --> 01:27:32,541
now they're looking for me...

901
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,123
I just want to know
what you said.

902
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,878
Make sure our stories line up,

903
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,496
- seeing as, um...
- Yeah.

904
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:39,031
- You're my boy and, uh
- Yeah,

905
01:27:39,056 --> 01:27:40,585
- it makes lot of sense,
- you know what I mean?

906
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:42,225
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

907
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,898
- I just wanna...
- Oh, fuck!

908
01:27:49,107 --> 01:27:50,308
Oh, god!

909
01:27:50,881 --> 01:27:51,926
No!

910
01:27:53,455 --> 01:27:54,836
What?

911
01:27:55,909 --> 01:27:57,182
No!

912
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,601
Why would you do that?

913
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:28,808
Do you watch Murray
Franklin show?

914
01:28:29,317 --> 01:28:30,326
Yeah.

915
01:28:31,977 --> 01:28:33,251
I'll be on it tonight.

916
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:39,713
It's fucking crazy 'innit?

917
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:41,314
Me on a telly.

918
01:28:43,633 --> 01:28:45,258
What the fuck, Arthur?

919
01:28:45,775 --> 01:28:46,784
What?

920
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:48,044
What?

921
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:55,500
It's okay, Garry.

922
01:28:55,759 --> 01:28:57,201
You can go.

923
01:28:59,349 --> 01:29:00,753
I'm not gonna hurt you.

924
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:07,864
Don't look.
Just go.

925
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:21,187
Oh, fuck.

926
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,385
- H-Hey Arthur?
- Yeah?

927
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:32,072
Arthur, can you get... the lock?

928
01:29:32,097 --> 01:29:33,683
Oh!

929
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:36,136
Shit.

930
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:38,091
It's alright, Garry.

931
01:29:48,922 --> 01:29:50,374
- Garry?
- Yeah?

932
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:55,457
You're the only one that's
ever been nice to me.

933
01:29:58,056 --> 01:29:59,949
Get out of here.

934
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,094
Hey, Arthur!
We need to talk!

935
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:34,120
Hey, stop, Arthur!

936
01:31:39,063 --> 01:31:40,075
Arthur!

937
01:31:42,558 --> 01:31:44,300
- You fucking...
- Hey, out of the way!

938
01:31:47,258 --> 01:31:48,511
Move!

939
01:31:50,503 --> 01:31:52,069
Arthur!

940
01:31:55,825 --> 01:31:57,369
- Hey!
- Hey!

941
01:32:03,634 --> 01:32:05,100
Arthur, stop!

942
01:32:10,021 --> 01:32:11,299
Go! Go!

943
01:32:18,058 --> 01:32:20,124
<i>Stand clear of
the closing doors.</i>

944
01:32:27,116 --> 01:32:28,183
Hold that train!

945
01:32:29,391 --> 01:32:30,458
Hold that train!

946
01:32:30,941 --> 01:32:31,941
Hold it!

947
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:33,283
Open the fucking door!

948
01:32:33,956 --> 01:32:35,429
Get out! Get out!

949
01:32:36,283 --> 01:32:38,113
<i>Next stop...</i>

950
01:32:51,742 --> 01:32:54,444
- Hey, asshole!
- Better watch it!

951
01:32:55,287 --> 01:32:57,164
Stand down! Now!

952
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:07,720
Police!
Stand down!

953
01:33:08,352 --> 01:33:10,179
Stand down!

954
01:33:13,835 --> 01:33:15,454
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh!

955
01:33:26,027 --> 01:33:28,800
Stop fighting!
Police! Police!

956
01:33:31,986 --> 01:33:34,348
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

957
01:33:35,232 --> 01:33:38,424
Police, get down!
Get the fuck down!

958
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,548
What the...?

959
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:55,489
Arthur!

960
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:57,705
Hey!

961
01:33:58,657 --> 01:34:00,296
God, no!

962
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:53,469
<i>Two officer on the train were violently
confronted by the crowd tonight</i>

963
01:34:53,508 --> 01:34:56,614
<i>and they're in serious but stable
condition at Gotham Metropolitan.</i>

964
01:34:57,165 --> 01:34:59,773
<i>We're going live now to
co-anchor Courtney Weathers</i>

965
01:34:59,798 --> 01:35:01,888
<i>who's standing by outside
the Bedford park station</i>

966
01:35:01,913 --> 01:35:03,807
<i>near where the
shooting took place.</i>

967
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:05,855
<i>Courtney, what's
the scene there?</i>

968
01:35:11,175 --> 01:35:12,680
- Murray!
- Hey, hey, hey!

969
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:15,058
- It's "Mr. Franklin!".
- Oh, come on, Gene.

970
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,481
That's all bullshit.

971
01:35:17,447 --> 01:35:19,027
Thank you, Murray.

972
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:21,254
I feel like I know you.

973
01:35:21,944 --> 01:35:23,616
I've been watching
you forever.

974
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:25,150
Thank you.

975
01:35:25,346 --> 01:35:26,675
What's with the face?

976
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:28,300
That mean that you we're
part of the protest?

977
01:35:28,325 --> 01:35:29,913
No. No.

978
01:35:29,983 --> 01:35:31,972
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

979
01:35:32,398 --> 01:35:33,899
I don't believe in anything.

980
01:35:34,636 --> 01:35:36,126
I just thought it would
be good for my act.

981
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:38,511
For your act? Didn't you hear
what happened on the subway?

982
01:35:38,536 --> 01:35:40,829
- Some clown got killed.
- He's aware of that, yeah.

983
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:42,534
No, I haven't heard.

984
01:35:42,749 --> 01:35:44,317
- Yeah?
- You see, this is what I'm telling you.

985
01:35:44,342 --> 01:35:46,428
The audience is gonna go
crazy if you put this guy on.

986
01:35:46,453 --> 01:35:48,681
Maybe... maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

987
01:35:48,706 --> 01:35:50,780
Gene, It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

988
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:53,632
We're gonna go with it.

989
01:35:54,244 --> 01:35:55,253
Thank you, Murray.

990
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,532
Couple of rules though:

991
01:35:56,696 --> 01:35:58,579
No cursing,
no off-color material,

992
01:35:58,604 --> 01:36:01,575
- we do a clean show, okay?

993
01:36:02,162 --> 01:36:03,664
You go on right after Dr. Sally.

994
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:05,755
- I love Dr. Sally.
- Good! Good, good.

995
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,638
- Well, someone will come and get you, okay?
- Okay.

996
01:36:08,277 --> 01:36:09,317
Perfect.

997
01:36:09,418 --> 01:36:10,573
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Murray.

998
01:36:10,597 --> 01:36:11,610
Okay.

999
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:14,244
Hey, Murray...
one small thing.

1000
01:36:14,642 --> 01:36:16,629
- Yeah?
- When you bring me out

1001
01:36:17,117 --> 01:36:18,920
can you introduce
me as "Joker"?

1002
01:36:19,361 --> 01:36:21,041
What's wrong with
your real name?

1003
01:36:21,481 --> 01:36:23,651
That's what you
called me on the show.

1004
01:36:23,882 --> 01:36:25,350
A Joker.

1005
01:36:25,406 --> 01:36:26,415
Do you remember?

1006
01:36:26,651 --> 01:36:28,363
- Did I?
- Yeah, I don't know.

1007
01:36:28,539 --> 01:36:30,999
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, joker it is.

1008
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,222
- It's good.
- Thanks, Murray.

1009
01:36:55,052 --> 01:36:58,027
I would try it, you know, but I'm not
sure my wife would let me do it.

1010
01:37:00,349 --> 01:37:02,117
Maybe my next wife.

1011
01:37:05,296 --> 01:37:07,249
You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.

1012
01:37:07,274 --> 01:37:09,389
I'm pretty sure this
guy can use a doctor.

1013
01:37:10,013 --> 01:37:12,163
Oh, does he have
a sexual problem?

1014
01:37:12,188 --> 01:37:14,460
He looks like he's got
a lot of problems.

1015
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:18,389
Alright, Let's show
that clip one last time.

1016
01:37:25,019 --> 01:37:28,882
<i>I hated school as a kid.</i>

1017
01:37:29,414 --> 01:37:31,777
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>

1018
01:37:32,674 --> 01:37:34,160
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

1019
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:37,308
<i>One day you'll have
to work for a living."</i>

1020
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:40,837
<i>"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"</i>

1021
01:37:46,562 --> 01:37:47,563
Okay,

1022
01:37:50,214 --> 01:37:53,471
you may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

1023
01:37:53,496 --> 01:37:55,976
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

1024
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:59,600
that we're all heartbroken about
what's going on in the city tonight.

1025
01:37:59,757 --> 01:38:02,400
But, this is how he
wanted to come out.

1026
01:38:02,426 --> 01:38:05,663
And, honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

1027
01:38:05,688 --> 01:38:07,996
So, please welcome "Joker".

1028
01:38:50,194 --> 01:38:52,373
Are you alright, doctor?

1029
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:57,058
Well, that was...
quite an interest.

1030
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:06,676
You okay?

1031
01:39:08,711 --> 01:39:10,166
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:39:10,392 --> 01:39:13,028
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1033
01:39:15,051 --> 01:39:16,782
Well, that makes one of us.

1034
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:25,872
So, can you tell
us about this look?

1035
01:39:26,268 --> 01:39:27,838
When we spoke earlier,
you mentioned

1036
01:39:27,863 --> 01:39:30,373
that this look is not a political
statement, is that right?

1037
01:39:30,702 --> 01:39:32,413
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1038
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:34,743
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1039
01:39:35,402 --> 01:39:37,014
And how's that
goin' for ya?

1040
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,750
It's alright. It's alright.
So, I know you're a comedian.

1041
01:39:47,162 --> 01:39:49,074
Have you been working
on any new material?

1042
01:39:49,106 --> 01:39:50,381
You want to tell us a joke?

1043
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,862
Yeah?

1044
01:39:58,947 --> 01:40:00,183
Okay.

1045
01:40:05,953 --> 01:40:07,697
He's got a book.

1046
01:40:08,481 --> 01:40:10,195
A book of jokes.

1047
01:40:19,619 --> 01:40:21,338
Take your time.
We go all night.

1048
01:40:27,034 --> 01:40:29,434
Okay. Okay.
Here's one.

1049
01:40:33,386 --> 01:40:35,024
Knock-knock.

1050
01:40:36,249 --> 01:40:37,838
And you had to look that up?

1051
01:40:44,105 --> 01:40:45,527
I wanted to get it right.

1052
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,211
Knock-knock.

1053
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:51,134
Who's there?

1054
01:40:52,371 --> 01:40:53,912
It's the Police, ma'am.

1055
01:40:53,927 --> 01:40:55,866
Your son has been hit
by a drunk driver.

1056
01:40:55,953 --> 01:40:57,384
He's dead.

1057
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:01,703
Oh, no, no, no!

1058
01:41:01,728 --> 01:41:03,767
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1059
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:05,846
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1060
01:41:05,871 --> 01:41:08,185
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

1061
01:41:08,838 --> 01:41:11,027
Okay, I'm s...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1062
01:41:11,324 --> 01:41:12,740
It's just, you know,

1063
01:41:13,287 --> 01:41:16,329
it's been a rough
few weeks, Murray,

1064
01:41:17,213 --> 01:41:18,780
ever since I

1065
01:41:21,648 --> 01:41:23,930
killed those three wall-street guys.

1066
01:41:30,368 --> 01:41:32,133
Okay. I'm waiting
for the punchline.

1067
01:41:33,785 --> 01:41:35,346
There is no punchline.

1068
01:41:36,869 --> 01:41:38,725
It's not a joke.

1069
01:41:44,205 --> 01:41:45,377
You're serious, aren't you?

1070
01:41:45,409 --> 01:41:47,771
You're telling us you killed those
three young men on the subway?

1071
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:50,669
- M-hm.
- And why should we believe you?

1072
01:41:50,945 --> 01:41:52,597
I've got nothing left to lose.

1073
01:41:54,902 --> 01:41:56,540
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1074
01:42:00,048 --> 01:42:02,785
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1075
01:42:06,183 --> 01:42:09,634
Let me get this straight, you think
that killing those guys is funny?

1076
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:11,673
I do.

1077
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:14,319
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1078
01:42:14,839 --> 01:42:16,900
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1079
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:18,580
Isn't that what they say?

1080
01:42:19,038 --> 01:42:20,505
All of you,

1081
01:42:20,845 --> 01:42:23,309
the system that
knows so much,

1082
01:42:23,747 --> 01:42:26,714
you decide what's
right or wrong

1083
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:30,763
the same way that you
decide what's funny...

1084
01:42:30,985 --> 01:42:32,401
or not.

1085
01:42:32,758 --> 01:42:34,163
Get him off!

1086
01:42:34,345 --> 01:42:35,794
Well, okay, I... I think

1087
01:42:36,081 --> 01:42:38,178
I might understand that you

1088
01:42:38,574 --> 01:42:40,099
did this to start a movement,

1089
01:42:40,176 --> 01:42:42,236
to become a symbol.

1090
01:42:42,734 --> 01:42:44,387
Come on, Murray,

1091
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:46,796
do I look like the kind of a clown
that could start a movement?

1092
01:42:47,512 --> 01:42:49,799
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1093
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,173
Everybody's awful these days.

1094
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:55,210
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1095
01:42:55,383 --> 01:42:58,075
Okay. So that's it, you're crazy.
That's your defense

1096
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,668
for killing three
young men?

1097
01:43:00,302 --> 01:43:01,311
Nah.

1098
01:43:01,983 --> 01:43:05,252
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1099
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,256
Oh! Why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1100
01:43:11,089 --> 01:43:14,585
If it was me dying on the side-walk,
you'd walk right over me.

1101
01:43:14,632 --> 01:43:17,741
I pass you everyday and you
don't notice me! but these guys,

1102
01:43:17,772 --> 01:43:20,935
what, because Thomas Wayne
went and cried about them on TV?

1103
01:43:20,977 --> 01:43:23,815
Well, you have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1104
01:43:23,815 --> 01:43:25,434
Yes, I do.

1105
01:43:26,184 --> 01:43:29,312
Have you seen what
it's like out there, Murray?

1106
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,932
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1107
01:43:33,074 --> 01:43:36,623
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1108
01:43:36,772 --> 01:43:38,726
Nobody's civil anymore!

1109
01:43:39,064 --> 01:43:42,388
Nobody thinks what
it's like to be the other guy.

1110
01:43:43,337 --> 01:43:45,221
You think men like Thomas Wayne

1111
01:43:45,316 --> 01:43:48,004
ever think what it's like
to be someone like me?

1112
01:43:48,272 --> 01:43:50,812
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1113
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:54,129
They think that we'll just
sit there and take it

1114
01:43:54,247 --> 01:43:55,783
like good little boys!

1115
01:43:55,845 --> 01:43:58,168
That we won't
werewolf and go wild.

1116
01:43:58,347 --> 01:43:59,562
You finished?

1117
01:43:59,873 --> 01:44:02,171
I mean, there is so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1118
01:44:02,414 --> 01:44:05,435
You sound like you're making
excuses for killing those young men.

1119
01:44:05,637 --> 01:44:08,810
Not everybody- and I'll tell you this-
not everyone is awful.

1120
01:44:10,927 --> 01:44:13,282
- But you're awful, Murray.
- Me?

1121
01:44:13,446 --> 01:44:15,830
I'm awful? Oh, yeah?
How am I awful?

1122
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,817
Playing my video,

1123
01:44:21,134 --> 01:44:22,750
inviting me on the show...

1124
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:26,521
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1125
01:44:27,577 --> 01:44:29,517
You're just like the rest of 'em.

1126
01:44:29,633 --> 01:44:31,729
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

1127
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:34,328
Look what happened because
of what you did, what it led to.

1128
01:44:34,696 --> 01:44:36,122
There are riots out there.

1129
01:44:36,247 --> 01:44:38,983
Two policemen are in critical
condition and you're laughing.

1130
01:44:39,008 --> 01:44:41,418
You're laughing.
Someone was killed today

1131
01:44:42,477 --> 01:44:43,993
because of what you did.

1132
01:44:44,018 --> 01:44:45,290
I know.

1133
01:44:48,051 --> 01:44:49,510
How about a another joke, Murray?

1134
01:44:49,535 --> 01:44:51,195
No, I think we got
enough of your jokes.

1135
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,783
- What do you get..
- I don't think so.

1136
01:44:52,808 --> 01:44:56,319
When you cross a mentally-ill
loner with a society

1137
01:44:56,344 --> 01:44:58,692
that abandons him and
treats him like trash?

1138
01:44:58,717 --> 01:44:59,870
Call the police, Gene.

1139
01:44:59,895 --> 01:45:01,264
- I'll tell you what you get.
- Call the police!

1140
01:45:01,289 --> 01:45:03,031
You get what you
fucking deserve!

1141
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:41,765
Good night.
And always remember.
