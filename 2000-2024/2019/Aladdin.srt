00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,017
Wow!

3
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,241
Their ship is so big.

4
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,938
Wish ours was that fancy.

5
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:10,909
I'd be so happy if
ours was that fancy.

6
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,617
- 'Cause then...
- Why is that?

7
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:14,632
'Cause is looks better?

8
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,616
This boat has seen us
through many a storm.

9
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,673
It may not look like much but,

10
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,820
it has something
theirs never will.

11
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,736
What? Wood rot and rats?

12
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:27,750
Are the children learning
something, dear?

13
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,157
It is unclear.

14
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,726
All right, sit, children.

15
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:36,132
I think it's time
that I told you the story

16
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,825
of Aladdin, the Princess,
and the lamp.

17
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:43,069
What's so special about a lamp?

18
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:44,524
Oh, this is a magic lamp.

19
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:46,232
Maybe if you sing.

20
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:47,602
It's better when you sing.

21
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:50,447

I don't want it.

for it, nothing more.

00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,249
I can't.

186
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,588
Look at me.
Look at me.

187
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,088
You... can do this.

188
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:34,374
- Oh.
- Oh.

189
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,444
Nicely done.

190
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:36,523
Thank you.

Come on. I know
somewhere we'll be safe.

200
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,659
Here comes the Master.

201
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,034
You bring me the rough
but never a diamond.

202
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,465
Take them away.

203
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,722
Take them away.

204
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:46,433
Majazeer, perhaps this

205
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:49,183
diamond in the rough
does not exist.

206
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,269
He is out there.

207
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,375
But we've searched for months.

208
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,969
I do not understand

209
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:57,094
what could possibly
be in that cave

210
00:12:57,172 --> 00:13:00,618
that could help a man
as great as you.

211
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,743
You are already second
only to the Sultan.

212
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,360
Second! Uh-oh.

213
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,266
Who's in trouble now?

214
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,125
And you think second is enough?

215
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,586
Of course.

216
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:15,883
You were not born to be sultan.

217
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,547
Not smart.

218
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:21,008
Do you know what I had to do
to get the power that I have?

219
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,071
The sacrifices that I've made?

220
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:24,852
The bodies that I've buried?

221
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:27,555
The five years spent
in a Sherabad jail?

222
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:30,055
People need to understand
that they will pay

223
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,672
for underestimating me.

224
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,032
Second is not enough!

225
00:13:33,057 --> 00:13:34,517
And it will never be enough!

226
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:35,923
That's why I need the lamp.

227
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,032
And why I no longer need you!

228
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:50,559
Tea?

229
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,669
Thank you.

230
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,880
And thank you for
getting me out of there.

231
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,599
Aladdin, isn't it?

232
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,795
Uh, you're welcome...

233
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:02,138
Um, I'm Dalia.

234
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:03,630
Dalia.

235
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:06,068
From the palace.

236
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:07,802
How could you tell?

237
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:10,241
Well, only someone
from the palace

238
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,905
could afford a bracelet like that.

239
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,780
And that silk lining
is imported, too.

240
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:17,601
It comes from the merchant
boats straight to the palace.

241
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,819
But not to servants.

242
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,226
At least not most servants.

243
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,726
Which means you...

244
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,546
are a handmaid to the Princess.

245
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,339
Impressive.

246
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,088
You think that's impressive.

247
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,026
You should see the
city from up there.

248
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:37,720
Agrabah.

249
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:39,892
It's so beautiful.

250
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,385
I should get out more.

251
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,946
You should tell the
Princess to get out more.

252
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:46,578
The people haven't
seen her in years.

253
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,289
They won't let her.

254
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,500
Ever since my...

255
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,532
The Queen was killed,

256
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,133
the Sultan's been afraid.

257
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:58,000
So she's kept locked away.

258
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,117
Seems everyone's been
afraid since then.

259
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:03,071
But the people of Agrabah
had nothing to do with that.

260
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,555
The people loved her.

261
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:06,726
They did, didn't they?

262
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,007
Is this yours?

263
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:13,672
It's kind of... borrowed.

264
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:23,011
My mother taught me that song.

265
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,441
Mine too.

266
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:27,222
It's all I remember of her.

267
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,051
And what about your father?

268
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,105
I lost them both
when I was young.

269
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,238
Been on my own ever since.

270
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,199
It's all right, it's just...

271
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,511
What?

272
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,628
It's a little sad...

273
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:43,370
having a monkey as the only
parental authority in your life.

274
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:46,988
We get by.

275
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,384
Every day, I just...
think things will be different,

276
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:53,439
but it never seems to change.

277
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,830
Just sometimes,
I feel like I'm...

278
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:58,134
Trapped.

279
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,259
Like you...

280
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,306
can't escape what
you were born into?

281
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,541
Yes.

282
00:17:12,342 --> 00:17:14,045
I have to get back to the palace.

283
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:15,553
Now?

284
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,459
It's just another prince
coming to court the princess.

285
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:30,700
Yes, and I have to
get her ready.

286
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,332
Oh, do you have my bracelet?

287
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:33,387
Sure.

288
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:39,317
I'm sure I put it in here.

289
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:41,825
Somewhere.

290
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,836
Abu, did you take it?

291
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,851
That was my mother's bracelet.

292
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:49,531
Yes, it's beautiful.

293
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,773
You are a thief.

294
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,586
No. No. Yes, but...

295
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:54,898
I was so naive.

296
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,086
Excuse me.

297
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,163
Wait. Wait. Wait!

298
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,109
Wait, it's not like that!

299
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,214
Street rat, get out of the way.

300
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,050
Who do you think you're
calling a street rat?

301
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,863
Are you talking back to me?

302
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,027
You were born worthless
and you will die worthless.

303
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,089
And only your fleas
will mourn you.

304
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:21,847
Come on, Abu.

305
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:23,839

There's a time that we do steal,
and a time we don't.

319
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,906
This was definitely a don't.

320
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:33,828
Welcome, Prince Anders.

321
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,625
We trust you had an
enjoyable journey.

322
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,188
Oh, wow.

323
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,510
Prince Anders, my daughter...

324
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:05,549
Princess Jasmine.

325
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,580
S-So...

326
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:11,252
Why did no one tell
me of your beauty?

327
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,979
No one mentioned yours, either.

328
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,455
Oh, thank you.

329
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,955
They say that in Skånland.

330
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,181
Ya, right?

331
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:23,526
It's... It's very, very amusing.

332
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,181
- Is it?
- Ya.

333
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:28,877
We have that same title yet are
never described the same way.

334
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,619
Mm-hrm... Jasmine.

335
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,487
Ya.

336
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,487
Oh.

337
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,526
What is that?

338
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:40,752
Don't. Don't tell me.

339
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:43,713
It's a cat... with stripes.

340
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,268
He likes you.

341
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,369
I know.

342
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:50,470
'Cause in Skånland, cats love me.
Here, puss-puss.

343
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:51,932
Hey, puss-puss.

344
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,565
Hey, puss-puss, puss...

345
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:58,573
My Sultan...

346
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,036
Our enemies grow
stronger every day,

347
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,770
yet you allow your daughter
to dismiss Prince Anders

348
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,731
and a possible military alliance.

349
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:06,880
Which enemies?

350
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:08,606
Sherabad continues to amass.

351
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,028
Sherabad is our ally.

352
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:11,528
Was our ally.

353
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,113
You would drag us into
a war with our only...

354
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:17,660
Yet you would allow your
kingdom to sink into ruin,

355
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:18,745
for mere sentiment!

356
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,989
Jafar!

357
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,324
Remember your place.

358
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,004
I apologize.

359
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:33,605
Forgive me, my Sultan.

360
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:35,941
I went too far.

361
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,285
But...

362
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:47,074
if you would only reconsider,

363
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:51,191
I think you would see

364
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,621
that invading Sherabad

365
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:57,387
is the right thing to do.

366
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:04,234
Invading Sherabad is...

367
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:05,855
Invade Sherabad?

368
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,703
Why would we invade
Mother's kingdom?

369
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,196
We would never invade Sherabad.

370
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:18,289
But an ally in Skånland would

371
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,078
improve our situation.

372
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:22,344
Yes. If you

373
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:25,234
consider giving
Prince Anders a chance.

374
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,406
To rule?

375
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,274
Baba, Rajah would
make a better ruler.

376
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,867
My dear, I'm not
getting any younger.

377
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,836
We must find you
a husband and...

378
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,125
we are running out of kingdoms.

379
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,047
What foreign prince can
care for our people as I do?

380
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:40,616
I could lead, if only...

381
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:43,149
My dear, you cannot be a sultan.

382
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,883
Because it has never been done

383
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:47,758
in the thousand-year
history of our kingdom.

384
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:51,899
I have been preparing for this
my whole life.

385
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:53,844
- I have read every...
- Books?

386
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:55,789
But you cannot read experience.

387
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:58,000
Inexperience is dangerous.

388
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,735
People, left unchecked, will revolt.

389
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:04,195
Walls and borders, unguarded,
will be attacked.

390
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:06,383
Jafar is right.

391
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:07,899
One day,

392
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,399
you will understand.

393
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:18,115
You may leave now.

394
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:39,482
Life will be kinder
to you, Princess,

395
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:43,193
once you accept these
traditions and understand

396
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:46,927
it's better for you to be seen

397
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,771
and not heard.

398
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:11,085

Meant to wash me away ♪

399
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:14,672

Open the gates!

413
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:19,141
You know what to do, Abu.

414
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:31,961
Close the gates!

415
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,687
Tacky monkey.

416
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:42,047
Remember your place, Jafar.

417
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:43,617
Remember your place.

418
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:45,656
If I hear that...!

419
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,992
One more time.

420
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,641
Sorry, Master.

421
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:52,820
Another petty insult
from that slow-minded fool.

422
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,976
He sees a city
where I see an empire.

423
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,344
Such vision.

424
00:25:57,883 --> 00:26:01,078
Once that lamp sits in my hand,

425
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:04,938
then I shall sit on his throne.

426
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:07,242
Thief! Thief in the palace.

427
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:09,875
Thief in the palace?

428
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,648
That's what I said.

429
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,779
Thief.

430
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,258
What have you seen, lago?

431
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:16,156
Diamond in the rough.

432
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,360
Who's a clever boy?

433
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,993
But Dalia, there has to be
something I can do.

434
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:58,544
A handsome prince
wants to marry you.

435
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:00,732
Oh, when will life get easier?

436
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,052
It's not that I don't want to
marry, it's just...

437
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:04,943
You want to be sultan.

438
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:05,919
But why?

439
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:07,826
You remember my
mother used to say,

440
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:10,779
"We would only ever be as happy
as our least happy subject."

441
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:13,529
If she saw what I saw today,

442
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:15,560
she would be heart-broken.

443
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:17,787
She would also want
you to be safe.

444
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:21,412
And clean. I'll draw the bath.

445
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:24,513
Jafar's guards on every corner.

446
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:27,083
Soon he'd have them
invading our neighbors,

447
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:29,263
risking lives, for what?

448
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:32,216
I can help!

449
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,130
I know I can.

450
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:38,068
I was born to do more than
marry some useless prince.

451
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,779
If you had to marry
a useless prince,

452
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:42,263
you could certainly do
worse than this one.

453
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:44,826
He's tall and handsome,

454
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,747
and yes, he's a little dim but,

455
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,622
you're just getting married.

456
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,684
It's not like you
have to talk to him.

457
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:54,997
But you'd prefer that
boy from the market.

458
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:07,732
Can I help you?

459
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,271
- Tea?
- You.

460
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,403
You! What are you doing here?

461
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:15,779
Get in here, now.

462
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:17,872
I... came back to
return your bracelet.

463
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,654
My bracelet? Where is it?

464
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:20,966
On your wrist.

465
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,372
What?

466
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,208
Not bad!

467
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,388
I like what she's
done with the place.

468
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,208
How did you get past the guards?

469
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,865
That was challenging.

470
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,052
But, I have my ways.

471
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:36,404
While the Princess is out,
would you like to go for a stroll?

472
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:38,263
Have a little chat?

473
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:40,646
You're unbelievable.

474
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,169
You cannot just
break into a palace

475
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,224
and walk around like
you own the place.

476
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,692
If you don't have anything,

477
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:48,412
you have to act like
you own everything.

478
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,247
So, what do you say?

479
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:52,716
I did find your bracelet.

480
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:54,779
You did not find it,
you stole it.

481
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:56,865
Correction, the monkey stole it.

482
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,435
He's your monkey.

483
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,443
He's still just a monkey.

484
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:02,294
Who ordered the tea?

485
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:05,091
Uh...

486
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:06,763
I did.

487
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:11,201
For you,

488
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:13,122
Princess Jasmine.

489
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:15,458
Your Majesty!

490
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,864
Why are you being weird?

491
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,435
Oh, I'm... the Princess... Yes!

492
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:33,169
Mm-hmm.

493
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:37,701
And it is good to be me
with all my

494
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:40,068
palaces and...

495
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:43,739
wagons of gold... things...

496
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:48,928
and dresses for...
every hour of the day.

497
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:54,038
Now it is time for
my cat to be cleaned.

498
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,249
She doesn't get out much.

499
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,772
Mm-hmm. Clearly.

500
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,780
Aren't you supposed
to be in the bath?

501
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:13,225
This cat isn't going
to clean itself.

502
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:16,344
But don't cats clean themselves?

503
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:18,759
You have to go now.

504
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:20,814
Oh, okay, but I'm coming
back tomorrow night.

505
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,150
What? No, you can't.

506
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:23,993
Meet me in the courtyard
beside the fountain.

507
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,110
When the moon is
above the minaret.

508
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:28,946
To return this.

509
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:34,750
I promise.

510
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,680
Can you believe it, Abu?

511
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,859
The most heavily guarded
place in all of Agrabah.

512
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:51,351
Evening.

513
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:52,758
Evening.

514
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:55,078
Evening.

515
00:30:56,242 --> 00:30:57,539
Guards are behind me.

516
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:01,426
Hello, boys.

517
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:26,574
Where am I?

518
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,254
In a world of trouble, boy.

519
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,249
That bracelet. Is that
what this is about?

520
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:35,523
Because I-I didn't steal it.

521
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:36,749
The handmaid...

522
00:31:36,774 --> 00:31:39,610
What was the handmaid doing
wearing the Queen's bracelet?

523
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,898
The Queen?

524
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,562
No, no. She said that

525
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,436
- it belonged to...
- Her mother.

526
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:48,913
Well, at least she told
the truth about one thing.

527
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:52,553
A-Are you saying that
was the Princess?

528
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:56,983
- I was talking to the...
- She was toying with you.

529
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,413
It amuses her to meet commoners.

530
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:04,038
Did you actually
think she liked you?

531
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:08,844
What do they call you?

532
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,531
Aladdin.

533
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:12,250
Aladdin.

534
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,492
People like us
must be realistic.

535
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:15,443
Us?

536
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:17,320
You see, I was once like you.

537
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,523
A common thief.

538
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,265
Only I thought bigger.

539
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:27,890
Steal an apple,
and you're a thief.

540
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,851
Steal a kingdom,
and you're a statesman.

541
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,906
Only weak men stop there.

542
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:37,570
You're either the most powerful
man in the room, or you're nothing.

543
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:41,547
You. You stumbled
upon an opportunity.

544
00:32:41,718 --> 00:32:43,507
I can make you rich.

545
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,773
Rich enough to impress a princess.

546
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,312
But nothing comes for free.

547
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,653
What would I have to do?

548
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:02,825
There's a cave nearby.

549
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:06,903
And in it, a simple oil lamp.

550
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:09,473
Retrieve it for me,
and I will make you

551
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,786
wealthy enough to
impress a princess.

552
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,075
You're nothing to her.

553
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:19,192
But you could be.

554
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:24,418
Your life begins now, Aladdin.

555
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,793
Still waiting?

556
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:37,035
No. No, I... came out to...

557
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:41,981
He promised.

558
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,285
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

559
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:49,066
Good night, Dalia.

560
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:58,895
The Cave of Wonders.

561
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:01,191
When you enter,
you will see more riches

562
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:03,059
than you've ever dreamed of.

563
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,981
Gold, diamonds...

564
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:07,215
and... the lamp.

565
00:34:07,285 --> 00:34:10,254
Bring it to me and I will
make you rich and free.

566
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:12,691
But take no other treasure,

567
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:15,019
no matter how sorely
you are tempted.

568
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,293
And you will be tempted.

569
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,309
Only one may enter here.

570
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:31,160
One who's worth lies far within.

571
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:34,254
A diamond in the rough.

572
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:36,746
Remember...

573
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,059
take nothing but the lamp.

574
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:23,425
Abu, don't touch. Remember?

575
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,299
Whoa.

576
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:21,440
Abu.

577
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,776
This is a magic carpet.

578
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,784
These really do exist.

579
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:30,073
Hello, carpet.

580
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,424
Let's see what we can do
about your situation here.

581
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:52,432
Oh, hey!

582
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,120
Don't mention it.

583
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,167
Abu, keep your little
monkey hands to yourself.

584
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,901
Abu! No!

585
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:17,690
You have touched the
forbidden treasure!

586
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:22,752
Now, you will never
again see the light

587
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,650
of day!

588
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,776
Carpet!

589
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,977
Abu, jump!

590
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:29,389
Could you give me a hand?

591
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,749
First, the lamp.

592
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,678
- No, no, first, your hand.
- We don't have much time.

593
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,085
Give me the lamp.

594
00:39:40,452 --> 00:39:41,764
Your hand!

595
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:43,905
Second no more, Master.

596
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:45,311
Now, your hand!

597
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,655
How about my foot?

598
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:52,233
No!

599
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:01,120
Get off me, monkey!

600
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,814
Dirty monkey.

601
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:25,688
Aaahhh!

602
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,025
We're alive.

603
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,445
I think.

604
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,578
Thank you, carpet.

605
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,164
Abu.

606
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:49,617
How did you...?

607
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:51,861
You cunning little monkey.

608
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:57,306
Now, all we need's a way out.

609
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:03,580
Hey, carpet, do you know
a way out of here?

610
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,595
The lamp?

611
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:10,908
What is that?

612
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:29,853
Oh, great one who summons me.

613
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:32,423
Terrible one who commands me.

614
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:35,017
I stand by my oath.

615
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,783
Loyalty to wishes three.

616
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:43,197
I said... oh...

617
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,822
great...

618
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:47,455
Excuse me.
Boy, where's your boss?

619
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:49,556
Help me out here,
where's your boss?

620
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,283
If I was gonna talk to myself,
I coulda just stayed in the lamp.

621
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,071
Hello!

622
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:56,351
Um...

623
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:57,705
Use your big boy voice.

624
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,212
I'm... talking...

625
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,431
to a smoking blue giant?

626
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,525
No!

627
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:06,252
I am not a giant.

628
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,056
I am a genie.
There's a difference.

629
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:11,533
Giants are not real.

630
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:13,712
- Where's your boss?
- Um, my boss?

631
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:16,470
Look, kid, I've been doing
this a long time, all right?

632
00:42:16,502 --> 00:42:18,642
There's always a guy, you know.

633
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:21,072
He's cheated somebody
or buried somebody or...

634
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,252
I mean, you get my point.
Where's that guy?

635
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:25,697
I know that guy.
He's outside.

636
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:26,986
So...

637
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:28,486
it's just...

638
00:42:29,353 --> 00:42:30,978
you and me down here?

639
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:32,478
And a monkey.

640
00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:34,899
That's your personal business, but

641
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:36,604
we gonna need to talk
about that monkey later.

642
00:42:36,628 --> 00:42:37,735
Such a pretty little monkey.

643
00:42:37,759 --> 00:42:39,243
So, you rubbed the lamp?

644
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:40,619
Uh-huh.

645
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,228
O... kay.

646
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,774
Hey, do you mind if I just

647
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,437
stretch it out over here?
Do you mind?

648
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,423
Uh, are you asking me?

649
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:48,916
You're my master.

650
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:51,627
I'm your master?

651
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:52,977
Downward dog!

652
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:55,258
No, no, no. You look like
you should be my master.

653
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,291
Right, but that's not
quite how it works, though.

654
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,111
How long have you
been trapped in here?

655
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:01,782
'Bout a thousand years.

656
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:02,954
A thousand years?

657
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:04,330
A thousand years?

658
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:07,931
Kid, is it me, or does, like,
everything surprise you?

659
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,361
So, you really
don't know who I am?

660
00:43:10,494 --> 00:43:12,611
Genie, wishes, lamp?

661
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,345
None of that ringin' a bell?

662
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:16,455

You can clap now.

00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:35,202
Puh-domp.

741
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,897
No, no, no, no.
Please, please, please, please.

742
00:46:39,983 --> 00:46:41,756
You can thank me outside.

743
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,272
I-In the sun.

744
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:44,803
When you wish us out.

745
00:46:45,124 --> 00:46:47,092
So, how does it work?

746
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:50,131
You're... kidding, right?

747
00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:52,866
The whole song...

748
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:55,608
was th-the instructions!

749
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:59,069
Obviously you can't dance
and listen at the same time.

750
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,153
So here's the basics:

751
00:47:00,178 --> 00:47:01,756
Step one. Rub the lamp.

752
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,538
Step two. Say what you want.

753
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:05,779
Step three. There is no step three.

754
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,169
See? It's that easy.

755
00:47:07,194 --> 00:47:09,841
You get three wishes. They must
begin with rubbing the lamp

756
00:47:09,866 --> 00:47:11,513
and saying "I wish". Got it?

757
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:13,272
- I think so.
- A couple other rules.

758
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,495
You can't wish for more wishes.
Three is enough.

759
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,989
Now, I can't make
anybody love anybody.

760
00:47:18,014 --> 00:47:20,629
Or bring anybody
back from the dead.

761
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:22,888
Feel free to interrupt me
anytime you don't understand.

762
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:25,133
I'm kidding. Don't ever interrupt me,
no matter what.

763
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:26,807
Now, I usually don't have
to go through all this

764
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:28,860
because by the time
the guy gets to me,

765
00:47:28,915 --> 00:47:30,438
he pretty much
knows what he wants

766
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:32,048
and it generally has to do with

767
00:47:32,073 --> 00:47:35,493
tons of money and power!

768
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:40,190
Do me a favor,
do not drink from that cup.

769
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:42,917
I promise you, there's not
enough money and power on earth

770
00:47:42,942 --> 00:47:44,292
for you to be satisfied.

771
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:46,111
Good?
So, what's your first wish?

772
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:47,768
Mm, well...

773
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:51,291
I have to think about it.
I mean, if there are only three.

774
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:53,159
Why are there only three, anyway?

775
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,081
I don't know! Who cares?

776
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:56,963
You don't know.

777
00:47:56,995 --> 00:47:58,651
I thought you were all-knowing?

778
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,362
That's 'cause you don't listen.

779
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,237
I never said I was all-knowing.

780
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:04,010
I said I was all-powerful.

781
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,456
The most powerful
being in the universe.

782
00:48:06,503 --> 00:48:09,174
Look, whatever I don't know,
I know I can learn it.

783
00:48:09,393 --> 00:48:10,682
Side in the sun.

784
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:12,612
Why you playin' hard to wish?

785
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:15,158
I know you can't tell,
but I'm very pale.

786
00:48:15,194 --> 00:48:16,677
This is sky blue.

787
00:48:16,702 --> 00:48:19,030
My natural pigmentation is navy.

788
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:20,592
Give us some sun!

789
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:21,819
Okay, Genie.

790
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:24,897
I wish for you
to get us out of this cave.

791
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:28,842
Oh, yeah!
He has made his first wish!

792
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,882
Thank you for choosing
carpets, camels and caravans.

793
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:32,986
Please don't forget to tip
your genie on the way out.

794
00:48:33,022 --> 00:48:34,702
Hold yourself, kid!

795
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:39,721
Whoo!

796
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:40,885
Whoa.

797
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:43,362
Man, look at this world.

798
00:48:43,577 --> 00:48:46,600
It's so... big.

799
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:48,694
Inside the lamp,
everything's like, brass!

800
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:51,007
Brass! Brass! Brass!

801
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:53,586
Like, ooh, is that some copper?
Nope! Brass!

802
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:56,354
Sorta the problem with the
genie life.

803
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:58,268
Phenomenal cosmic powers,

804
00:48:58,432 --> 00:49:00,284
but itty-bitty living space.

805
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:02,718
So, is this magic?

806
00:49:02,788 --> 00:49:04,382
Or are you magic?

807
00:49:04,515 --> 00:49:06,960
Eh, kind of a package deal.

808
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,304
Can you warn me
before you do that?

809
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:13,046
Oh, you'll get used to it.

810
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,468
Right.

811
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:17,258
So, do I have to make
all my wishes here?

812
00:49:17,362 --> 00:49:19,675
I mean, if I take you back to
Agrabah, won't people...?

813
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:22,792
No, no, no, no, no.
I can look totally normal.

814
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,159
Right. Totally normal.

815
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:29,310
Still blue.

816
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:33,380
Do we need the top knot?

817
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,349
That's my little cherry on top.

818
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:36,805
Okay, okay.

819
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,523
So...

820
00:49:39,508 --> 00:49:41,063
What are you gonna wish?

821
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:42,820
Oh, I-I haven't
thought about that.

822
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:46,117
Mm. You really are not that guy.

823
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:48,956
Okay.
So what would you wish for?

824
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:54,799
No one's ever
asked me that before.

825
00:49:55,648 --> 00:49:57,265
An easy one though.

826
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,609
I wish to be free.

827
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:01,661
To not have to say,

828
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:03,247
Can I help you?

829
00:50:03,598 --> 00:50:04,638
What would you like?

830
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:06,988
Welcome to the lamp.
May I take your order please?

831
00:50:07,597 --> 00:50:08,611
Freedom.

832
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,361
I wish to be...

833
00:50:10,962 --> 00:50:12,408
To be human.

834
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,402
Why don't you just
set yourself free?

835
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:18,547
Carpet!

836
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,125
Did you hear
what this boy said?

837
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,696
Why don't I set myself free?

838
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:25,523
Only way a genie
gets to be free is if

839
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:27,069
the owner of the lamp

840
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,905
uses one of his wishes
to set him free.

841
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,047
And the last time
that happened was, like,

842
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,321
the fourth of Never-ary.

843
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:38,836
I'll do it.

844
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:40,218
I've got three, right?

845
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:41,804
Actually, you have two left.

846
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:44,626
You used one to get out
of the cave, remember?

847
00:50:44,696 --> 00:50:46,860
Did I? Or did you?

848
00:50:46,885 --> 00:50:48,899
I thought I had to be
rubbing the lamp?

849
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:51,462
Okay, little street boy.
Let's rewind the tape.

850
00:50:54,597 --> 00:50:55,691
Okay, Genie.

851
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:56,956
Oooh!

852
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,425
The old
monkey-with-the-lamp trick.

853
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:01,886
Never seen that one before.

854
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,324
Keep my eye on you.

855
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:07,284
At least now I can use my
third wish to set you free.

856
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:10,456
Here's the thing about wishes.

857
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,574
The more you have,

858
00:51:12,971 --> 00:51:14,214
the more you want.

859
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:15,855
That's not me.

860
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:17,659
Hmm.

861
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:18,972
We'll see about that.

862
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:20,988
- But there is something.
- Uh-oh.

863
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,826
Seen that face before.

864
00:51:22,865 --> 00:51:23,881
Who is she?

865
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:25,216
Who's the girl?

866
00:51:25,803 --> 00:51:26,912
She's a princess.

867
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,514
Aww, aren't they all?

868
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,209
Treat your woman like a
queen, I always say.

869
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:34,120
No. No, she's
an actual princess.

870
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:35,260
Well, I already told you.

871
00:51:35,314 --> 00:51:37,564
I can't make anyone
love anyone, so.

872
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:39,565
No, no. We had a connection.

873
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,018
Did they?

874
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:46,489
She is smart and kind
and so beautiful.

875
00:51:46,514 --> 00:51:48,912
But she has to marry a...

876
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:51,943
Hey, can you make me a prince?

877
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:56,584
There's a lot of gray area
in "make me a prince".

878
00:51:56,677 --> 00:51:59,037
I could just... make you a prince.

879
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:00,309
Oh, no.

880
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:02,615
Right, you'd be snuggled up with
that dude for the rest of your life.

881
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,045
Yo, you all seen my palace?

882
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:07,013
Be specific with your words.

883
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:09,825
- The deal is in the detail.
- Got it.

884
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,100
Which I don't really understand

885
00:52:11,124 --> 00:52:13,388
because if she already
likes you, why change?

886
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:16,089
I told you she
has to marry a prince.

887
00:52:16,114 --> 00:52:17,339
I just wanna go home, man.

888
00:52:17,464 --> 00:52:19,535
Okay. I can do that.

889
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:22,371
An official wish this time,

890
00:52:22,402 --> 00:52:23,808
for those of us
who are counting,

891
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,699
which now, I am one.

892
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,441
Genie... I wish...

893
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:29,488
Lamp?

894
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,097
Oh. Sorry.

895
00:52:32,756 --> 00:52:33,858
All right.

896
00:52:34,272 --> 00:52:35,271
Genie...

897
00:52:35,296 --> 00:52:36,749
Don't hurt him, Genie.

898
00:52:37,325 --> 00:52:38,614
I wish...

899
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:40,411
to become...

900
00:52:40,981 --> 00:52:42,215
a prince.

901
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,950
Back up, boy,
I need some room to work.

902
00:52:44,403 --> 00:52:46,216
I'm about to fabulize you.

903
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:48,602
Genie?

904
00:52:53,134 --> 00:52:55,345
A little head-spinning.
Better though, right?

905
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:58,361
I think I'm...
getting used to it.

906
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,822
Okay, a prince, a prince.

907
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:04,892
Obviously, the ghetto-chic
is not gonna work.

908
00:53:05,306 --> 00:53:07,782
I'm feeling a periwinkle.

909
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:09,447
Wh-What's periwinkle?

910
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:11,423
No. Chartreuse.

911
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,815
- The lines are all wrong.
- What is this?

912
00:53:16,886 --> 00:53:18,596
The color clashes
with your skin tone.

913
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:20,026
The silhouette is confused.

914
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:21,198
This is a big hat.

915
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:23,175
No, that is not a big hat.

916
00:53:23,276 --> 00:53:25,440
Come on, Genie,
gotta beat the door down.

917
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:27,026
Gotta go bold!

918
00:53:27,112 --> 00:53:28,792
Gotta... gold!

919
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:30,964
Aah, no!

920
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:33,088
- We've gone too far.
- Genie! You slippin'.

921
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:34,638
It's gotta be neutral
for the desert.

922
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:37,346
Ivory, beige, bone, Albion.

923
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:38,705
It's a little heavy.

924
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,400
Oh!

925
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:45,322
And the crowd goes wild!

926
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:47,189
Oho!

927
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:50,197
The Genie! The Genie's on fire!

928
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:52,852
The Genie's on fire, folks.

929
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:56,228
Somebody cool me down!

930
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,306
Somebody put me out!
I'm too much!

931
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,705
So what do you think?

932
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:04,306
I like it.

933
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:05,853
Of course you like it, boy.
I made it.

934
00:54:05,878 --> 00:54:07,103
I think that's me.

935
00:54:07,189 --> 00:54:09,336
Strictly speaking, it... it's me.

936
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:11,798
I mean, I did most of the work.
You was just standing there.

937
00:54:11,823 --> 00:54:12,884
But I hear you.

938
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:15,134
But won't people recognize me?

939
00:54:15,205 --> 00:54:18,017
Nobody will recognize you.
That's how genie magic works.

940
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:20,013
People see what
they're told to see.

941
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:21,231
Right.

942
00:54:21,669 --> 00:54:23,317
- Who am I?
- Who...

943
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,096
Prince... Ali.

944
00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:29,956
- From?
- Duh.

945
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:31,158
From Abuvwah.

946
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:32,956
A-bab-wah?

947
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,206
You're not listenin'.
Ababwah.

948
00:54:35,807 --> 00:54:37,385
- Is that a real place?
- Yeah.

949
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,596
Like, everybody knows about it.
It has a brochure.

950
00:54:40,768 --> 00:54:42,799
A little hot in the summer,
temperate in the fall.

951
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,221
I-I'll let you read it en route.

952
00:54:45,236 --> 00:54:46,799
How are we gonna get there?

953
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,846
I guess you can't ride a chimp.

954
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:51,505
Don't you just love
a moonwalking monkey?

955
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:53,553
Uh-uh, hold it there, Abu.

956
00:54:54,842 --> 00:54:56,318
Donkey. Too small.

957
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:01,185
No. Too obvious.

958
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,060
We need something robust.

959
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:09,453
Relax, Abu.
It's just for a minute.

960
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:10,547
Whoa.

961
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:12,071
Prince Ali...

962
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,391
of Ababwah.

963
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,414
And now, for your entourage.

964
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:16,461
What?

965
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:20,513

966
00:55:20,538 --> 00:55:21,616

What you doing?
Put your arms down.

1045

I'm... I'm presenting it.

1046
00:59:45,178 --> 00:59:46,193
Put your arms down.

1047
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:48,763
It's a pleasure to
welcome you to Agrabah,

1048
00:59:48,788 --> 00:59:50,013
Prince Ali.

1049
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:54,998
- How did you break that?
- I don't know. It fell off.

1050
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,920
It's a pleasure to meet him.

1051
00:59:56,998 --> 00:59:58,207
Uh...

1052
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:01,060
It's just as much... a pleasure

1053
01:00:01,138 --> 01:00:03,303
for me, Your Highness, Sir.

1054
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,363
You look very serene.

1055
01:00:05,388 --> 01:00:06,904
That's a curtsy, not a bow.

1056
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:08,153
Stand up.

1057
01:00:08,178 --> 01:00:11,475
I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with...
Ababwa.

1058
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,506
- Well, it's north.
- It's south.

1059
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:19,819
Uh, we have a north

1060
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,858
and a south.

1061
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:22,980
What?

1062
01:00:23,014 --> 01:00:25,341
It's near, if you were to go...
it's... it's...

1063
01:00:25,366 --> 01:00:28,506
Around there, you can find it,
if you just look.

1064
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:29,670
Don't help me.

1065
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:32,694
The world is changing
quickly, Jafar.

1066
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,819
It seems as if there is
a new country every day.

1067
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:40,251
Don't touch me.

1068
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:41,884
Don't touch me.

1069
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:42,993
Well.

1070
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:44,837
Yes!

1071
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:46,368
You are very wise.

1072
01:00:46,572 --> 01:00:48,368
Um, tell him that we have
gifts, please.

1073
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:50,009
Oh, right!

1074
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:52,126
We have things! Gifts!

1075
01:00:52,258 --> 01:00:53,532
Did you organize this?

1076
01:00:53,712 --> 01:00:54,970
Bi-baba!

1077
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:59,798
Yes, here we are! Gifts.

1078
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,353
Coming right up.

1079
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:04,376
We have spices. Golden camels.

1080
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:06,158
And spoons, tiny spoons.

1081
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:07,400
Spoons!

1082
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:09,259
How do they make 'em that tiny?

1083
01:01:09,284 --> 01:01:10,447
We have jams!

1084
01:01:10,472 --> 01:01:11,798
- Jams?
- Jams.

1085
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:13,228
Yes, jams!

1086
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:14,876
Yam jams.

1087
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:16,048
Fig jams.

1088
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:17,157
Yam jams!

1089
01:01:17,182 --> 01:01:18,243
And date jams.

1090
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:19,408
Seedless.

1091
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:22,281
Delicious, e-exotic jams.

1092
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:24,845
Move. Away. From the jams.

1093
01:01:24,908 --> 01:01:26,595
- What?
- We have jewels.

1094
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:27,986
Jewels!

1095
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:29,064
We have them.

1096
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:30,970
And, uh, that!

1097
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,290
Over there.

1098
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:33,923
Hidden for...

1099
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:35,235
suspense.

1100
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:36,322
Wfoo.

1101
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:37,900
Ta-da.

1102
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:40,681
It's a... wheel?

1103
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:43,867
It's a... very expensive.

1104
01:01:43,937 --> 01:01:47,266
And what do you hope to buy
with this... expensive?

1105
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,578
You!

1106
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:52,625
Wow.

1107
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,586
No! No, no, no, no!
A moment with you.

1108
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,134
A moment... that's not...

1109
01:01:57,251 --> 01:01:58,486
Pkkffw.

1110
01:01:58,564 --> 01:02:00,877
Are you suggesting I am for sale?

1111
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:02,361
Of course.

1112
01:02:02,948 --> 01:02:05,010
Not! No, of course not!

1113
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:06,127
No!

1114
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,158
It's cold, and it's dark

1115
01:02:09,213 --> 01:02:10,534
in that lamp.

1116
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,799
But I prefer it to this.

1117
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:14,799
Please excuse me,
I... need to go and...

1118
01:02:15,143 --> 01:02:16,659
find some bread.

1119
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:20,159
For the jams.

1120
01:02:20,184 --> 01:02:22,338
No, no, that's not
what I meant. I...

1121
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:23,768
You did great.

1122
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:25,440
That's not what I meant.

1123
01:02:25,565 --> 01:02:27,440
Just leave her alone.
You didn't do great.

1124
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:30,315
You will... get a chance
to speak again.

1125
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:34,072
We hope you can join us tonight,
Prince Ali,

1126
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:36,745
when we celebrate our harvest.

1127
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,213
Of course,

1128
01:02:38,299 --> 01:02:39,541
Your...

1129
01:02:39,627 --> 01:02:41,276
Serene Self.

1130
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:43,018
We will join you.

1131
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,745
Smooth.

1132
01:02:45,612 --> 01:02:47,627
In 10,000 years,

1133
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:49,924
I've never been that embarrassed.

1134
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:01,169
Don't worry. You are not
out of the game yet.

1135
01:03:01,254 --> 01:03:03,153
Just do whatever you
normally do at a party.

1136
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,739
I've never been to a party.

1137
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:05,764
What?

1138
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:06,980
What?

1139
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:08,982
Oh, you gonna need to go
back to the room then.

1140
01:03:09,006 --> 01:03:10,395
You're not messin' up my night.

1141
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,864
Prince Ali.

1142
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:15,661
May I have a word?

1143
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:17,200
Privately?

1144
01:03:18,396 --> 01:03:20,904
This doesn't concern your
servant.

1145
01:03:23,005 --> 01:03:25,029
Be over there,
minding my business.

1146
01:03:30,294 --> 01:03:31,622
I know who you are.

1147
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,090
You do?

1148
01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:38,927
Yes.

1149
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:42,279
You're a man of great
ambition, like myself.

1150
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:46,310
I, uh, I don't believe we've
been properly introduced.

1151
01:03:46,419 --> 01:03:47,529
Jafar.

1152
01:03:47,966 --> 01:03:50,021
Vizier to the Sultan.

1153
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,980
I could be a valuable ally

1154
01:03:52,005 --> 01:03:54,154
to help you get what you want.

1155
01:03:54,466 --> 01:03:56,247
I, uh, I will think on that.

1156
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:57,786
I don't wanna keep
the Princess waiting.

1157
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,872
Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear.

1158
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:04,966
This offer will not be on
the table for long, you see.

1159
01:04:07,528 --> 01:04:08,911
Prince Ali...

1160
01:04:09,098 --> 01:04:10,458
Excuse me.

1161
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,950
Prince Ali, your
presence is requested.

1162
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:16,005
So I guess that's <i>the</i> guy.

1163
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:18,185
Mm-hmm, that's the guy.

1164
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:28,069
Okay, there she is.

1165
01:04:28,569 --> 01:04:29,623
This is your chance.

1166
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:30,733
You know what?

1167
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:33,593
There are a lot of people.
I don't think I can do this.

1168
01:04:34,483 --> 01:04:35,929
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

1169
01:04:35,983 --> 01:04:37,272
This one's gonna be easy.

1170
01:04:37,843 --> 01:04:40,296
Ooh! Look at her handmaid.

1171
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:46,171
She's gonna get some punch.
Feelin' a little thirsty myself.

1172
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,765
No. No, no, no, no.
You can't leave me.

1173
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,842
- They'll see right through me.
- No, they won't.

1174
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:51,843
All you have to do
is walk over there.

1175
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:54,233
And speak.
I also have to speak.

1176
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:55,757
Okay, listen to me.

1177
01:04:55,936 --> 01:04:57,382
I live in a lamp.

1178
01:04:57,725 --> 01:05:01,265
But this is a party.
Do not mess this up for me.

1179
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:03,679
Okay? I'd like to party.

1180
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:04,983
Go get her!

1181
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,890
Okay. Mm-hrm.

1182
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:17,396
Princess Jasmine!

1183
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:19,888
You! You're... still here.

1184
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:21,263
Yas.

1185
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,529
What you doing?

1186
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:27,989
Hmm?

1187
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:29,263
What are you doing?

1188
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:32,708
I'm just making sure the water's...
a good temperature.

1189
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:34,169
Why are you not over there?

1190
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,990
How am I supposed to
compete with that?

1191
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:38,693
Look at him. He's so princely.

1192
01:05:38,779 --> 01:05:42,005
You have got to be more confident
about what you have to offer.

1193
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,763
What do I have to offer?

1194
01:05:43,826 --> 01:05:45,255
Knowledge of how to steal food?

1195
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,326
How to jump between buildings?

1196
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,614
Now, Prince Ali, he has jewels.

1197
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:51,060
Stop, stop, stop.

1198
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:55,833
I made you look like a prince
on the outside.

1199
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,091
I didn't change anything
on the inside.

1200
01:05:59,716 --> 01:06:01,865
Prince Ali got you to the door.

1201
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:04,115
But Aladdin has to open it.

1202
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,044
Oh.

1203
01:06:06,185 --> 01:06:08,318
See, the sultan does like me.

1204
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:10,873
Okay, well, maybe he'll
let you be his wife.

1205
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:15,865
Look at that. Another prince
more interested in Baba.

1206
01:06:16,529 --> 01:06:18,990
I don't know. I think this
one might be different.

1207
01:06:19,302 --> 01:06:22,310
And he comes with an
incredibly attractive friend.

1208
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,724
Please make it work.

1209
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:26,912
And what about Prince Ali?

1210
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:29,492
Oh, look at him,
he's trying so hard.

1211
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:31,891
And that's the problem.

1212
01:06:32,094 --> 01:06:33,107
Showtime.

1213
01:06:33,132 --> 01:06:34,501
No, I'm waiting for
the right moment.

1214
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:37,031
No, no. No waiting.
We're done waiting.

1215
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:38,659
No. I'm in charge, okay?

1216
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:40,796
I say when it's
the right moment.

1217
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:46,934
Really? Really?

1218
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:50,236
He's here. Say something.

1219
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:51,767
Act natural.

1220
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:54,267
Hi!

1221
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,288
I'm sorry... for the...

1222
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,344
The jams.

1223
01:06:59,422 --> 01:07:00,945
And the jewels,
and the-and the...

1224
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:02,492
And the buying you.

1225
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:03,820
That wasn't me.

1226
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:04,904
It-It was me.

1227
01:07:04,929 --> 01:07:07,516
I don't, I-it was me. I don't
have a twin or anything.

1228
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:10,218
But, uh, I... um...

1229
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,297
- You're...
- Dance? I'd love to.

1230
01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:14,437
Yes.

1231
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,556
Go. Go.

1232
01:09:42,986 --> 01:09:45,416
Something very
strange about him.

1233
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,767
Keep a close eye on Prince Ali.

1234
01:09:51,627 --> 01:09:52,681
Walked out.

1235
01:09:52,751 --> 01:09:55,767
Maybe I went a tad far
with the backflip, but

1236
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,860
that dance

1237
01:09:56,885 --> 01:09:59,549
may be the best thing
you ever do in your life.

1238
01:10:00,064 --> 01:10:01,345
I was pretty good.

1239
01:10:01,424 --> 01:10:03,252
But nothing seems
to impress her.

1240
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:04,900
Yeah, it's crazy. Not

1241
01:10:04,925 --> 01:10:07,353
gems or jams or jewels.

1242
01:10:07,588 --> 01:10:08,994
If I can't impress her,

1243
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:10,838
I wonder who can.

1244
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:13,236
What's that supposed to mean?

1245
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:16,939
I'm just sayin'
try being yourself?

1246
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:18,808
But she has to marry a prince.

1247
01:10:19,753 --> 01:10:22,511
If I just had a few more
minutes with her, I know I could...

1248
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:26,323
- You need to get me over there.
- Is that an official wish?

1249
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:28,729
No. It's a favor... for a friend.

1250
01:10:28,776 --> 01:10:31,862
Ooh, yeah, see, genies
don't really have friends.

1251
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:34,097
I thought you said you
never had a friend like me?

1252
01:10:34,144 --> 01:10:37,901
No. I said you...
never had a friend like me.

1253
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:39,487
When you're a genie,

1254
01:10:39,534 --> 01:10:41,448
somebody always wants
somethin' from you.

1255
01:10:41,473 --> 01:10:42,667
I-It's awkward.

1256
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:44,315
You're right. You're right.

1257
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:46,581
Besides, it would've involved

1258
01:10:46,606 --> 01:10:48,284
distracting a
certain handmaiden...

1259
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:50,753
Ooh! Ha! See what you're doin'.

1260
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:52,440
You hooked me.
See you there?

1261
01:11:00,565 --> 01:11:01,644
Good evening.

1262
01:11:01,893 --> 01:11:03,557
How did you get past the guards?

1263
01:11:03,862 --> 01:11:06,542
Oh, uh, I snuck past.

1264
01:11:06,612 --> 01:11:09,425
All 48 of them?
Even the ones that eat fire?

1265
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:10,518
Impressive.

1266
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,854
That's why I'm, uh...

1267
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:13,698
That's what people say about me.

1268
01:11:14,925 --> 01:11:17,847
Oh, that-that didn't come out
the right way.

1269
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:20,089
No one says that.
I-I don't know why I said that.

1270
01:11:22,151 --> 01:11:23,558
They're beautiful.

1271
01:11:23,894 --> 01:11:25,058
She will hate them.

1272
01:11:25,276 --> 01:11:28,448
Tell Prince Ali, the way to
her heart is through her mind.

1273
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:32,151
Actually, these are from me...
to you.

1274
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:36,323
Could you excuse me
one moment?

1275
01:11:36,378 --> 01:11:38,104
Wait, just...

1276
01:11:43,394 --> 01:11:44,901
"That's what people
say about me."

1277
01:11:45,362 --> 01:11:46,597
Come on, Genie!

1278
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,651
My favorites.

1279
01:11:48,925 --> 01:11:50,745
I accept. Please continue.

1280
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,791
I was noticing how...
pleasant the evening is.

1281
01:11:55,816 --> 01:12:00,685
At the party, I noticed...
you noticing how...

1282
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,967
pleasant I am.

1283
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:05,089
Right. How's this going?

1284
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:07,800
It's clumsy, but in a
charming sort of way.

1285
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:09,831
Uh, a stroll.

1286
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,785
Would you like to take
an evening stroll?

1287
01:12:15,316 --> 01:12:16,847
Just the two of us?

1288
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,277
On purpose?

1289
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:20,011
Yes. As people.

1290
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:22,807
Just one more second.

1291
01:12:22,832 --> 01:12:23,839
Okay.

1292
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:26,308
Why would I say "as people"?

1293
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,675
The kid is contagious.

1294
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:37,479
I've never done this before.
How does it work?

1295
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:39,956
Do you like sheep cheese?

1296
01:12:45,018 --> 01:12:46,135
Come in.

1297
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,331
Actually, I'm already in.

1298
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:50,620
Don't move.

1299
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:56,502
I just came back...
because you left so...

1300
01:12:56,527 --> 01:12:58,433
How did you get there?

1301
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,511
Magic carpet?

1302
01:13:01,536 --> 01:13:02,536
Hmm.

1303
01:13:03,824 --> 01:13:05,636
Actually, I'm glad you are here.

1304
01:13:06,027 --> 01:13:07,097
You are?

1305
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:08,855
I've been trying to find Ababwa,

1306
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:11,636
but it doesn't seem to
be on any of my maps.

1307
01:13:12,964 --> 01:13:14,245
Care to show me?

1308
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:15,964
I'd love to.

1309
01:13:17,386 --> 01:13:19,402
Oh, Rajah, let's not
eat the Prince today.

1310
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:21,214
He needs his legs for dancing.

1311
01:13:22,753 --> 01:13:24,963
Did I go too far
with the backflip?

1312
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:26,128
A little.

1313
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:29,362
Ababwah?

1314
01:13:29,549 --> 01:13:30,549
Yes.

1315
01:13:30,602 --> 01:13:31,930
Genie, I need to find Ababwah.

1316
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:34,266
The other brother, the short one.
Not the one who

1317
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:35,656
gifted me a goat.

1318
01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:37,978
She has lots of maps.

1319
01:13:39,463 --> 01:13:41,416
Ababwah, of course.

1320
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:48,169
Ababwah.

1321
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,724
Yak napkins are not easy to find.

1322
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:06,514
Have you lost your country?

1323
01:14:06,787 --> 01:14:09,397
My country? No. No.

1324
01:14:13,998 --> 01:14:15,513
There it is.

1325
01:14:16,513 --> 01:14:18,724
I don't think so.
I've been...

1326
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:22,865
There it is!

1327
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:25,615
How did I not see that?

1328
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:27,451
Who needs maps anyway?

1329
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:29,685
They're old and useless.

1330
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,443
And have no practical value.

1331
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,412
Maps are how I see the world.

1332
01:14:33,919 --> 01:14:36,623
I thought a princess
could go anywhere?

1333
01:14:37,755 --> 01:14:38,974
Not this princess.

1334
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,959
Uh, well, uh, would you...?

1335
01:14:45,216 --> 01:14:47,201
Would you wanna...?

1336
01:14:48,646 --> 01:14:49,659
Sorry.

1337
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,034
Sorry.

1338
01:14:52,393 --> 01:14:53,464
Rajah.

1339
01:15:01,194 --> 01:15:02,217
Thanks...

1340
01:15:02,842 --> 01:15:04,256
for that.

1341
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:07,709
I-I was saying...

1342
01:15:08,294 --> 01:15:10,545
You should see these places.

1343
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,241
I mean, there's a whole world

1344
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:15,310
outside of books and maps.

1345
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:19,412
Do you want to?

1346
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:21,881
How? The door's guarded.

1347
01:15:22,321 --> 01:15:24,024
Who said anything about a door?

1348
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,945
What are you doing?

1349
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:27,907
Sometimes Princess...

1350
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:32,219
Sometimes,
you just have to take a risk.

1351
01:15:36,391 --> 01:15:38,140
What just happened?

1352
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,008
What?

1353
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,157
Is this...?

1354
01:15:49,266 --> 01:15:50,945
A magic carpet.

1355
01:15:52,274 --> 01:15:53,703
Do you trust me?

1356
01:15:54,391 --> 01:15:55,758
What did you say?

1357
01:15:55,922 --> 01:15:57,313
Do you trust me?

1358
01:16:02,777 --> 01:16:04,019

this is by far,
the most beautiful.

1398
01:19:25,654 --> 01:19:28,341
Sometimes you just have to see
it from a different perspective.

1399
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:32,185
It's them, the people.
They make it beautiful.

1400
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:34,826
And they deserve a
leader who knows that.

1401
01:19:35,232 --> 01:19:37,223
I don't know why I
think it could be me.

1402
01:19:37,248 --> 01:19:38,724
Because it should be you.

1403
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,084
You think so?

1404
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,568
Does it matter, what I think?

1405
01:19:51,592 --> 01:19:54,646
Oh, look at that adorable
monkey down there. Is that Abu?

1406
01:19:54,671 --> 01:19:56,880
No, no, it couldn't be Abu, he's...

1407
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:03,176
So, how many names
do you have,

1408
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:05,193
Prince Aladdin?

1409
01:20:05,295 --> 01:20:06,435
No, no, I...

1410
01:20:06,513 --> 01:20:07,912
So, who's Prince Ali?

1411
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:10,990
I am... Prince Ali.

1412
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:12,544
But how would you
know the city so well?

1413
01:20:12,568 --> 01:20:14,318
I came to Agrabah early.

1414
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:17,529
Because to know a people,
you have to see them for yourself.

1415
01:20:17,554 --> 01:20:19,115
But you already know that.

1416
01:20:19,256 --> 01:20:22,497
When we first met, you were
disguised in your own city.

1417
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:24,357
You saw us arrive

1418
01:20:24,382 --> 01:20:27,678
with dancers, an elephant,
and a magic carpet.

1419
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:29,974
How could a street thief
have all that?

1420
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,443
But how could I not
recognize you?

1421
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:35,872
People don't see the real you
when you're royalty.

1422
01:20:38,724 --> 01:20:40,076
I'm sorry.

1423
01:20:40,997 --> 01:20:42,065
I'm embarrassed.

1424
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:44,308
I mean, you've seen
more of Agrabah in days

1425
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:46,256
than I have in an
entire lifetime.

1426
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:51,613
We should...

1427
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,699
probably head back.

1428
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,597
Already?

1429
01:21:08,043 --> 01:21:09,535
Until tomorrow, Princess.

1430
01:21:24,902 --> 01:21:26,144
Good night.

1431
01:21:29,269 --> 01:21:30,433
Good night.

1432
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:36,214
Yes.

1433
01:21:38,714 --> 01:21:40,472
Woo-hoo!

1434
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:45,043
Fascinating.

1435
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:49,597
Ooh!

1436
01:21:49,965 --> 01:21:51,246
I like that face.

1437
01:21:51,371 --> 01:21:53,457
- Good date?
- The best.

1438
01:21:53,605 --> 01:21:55,409
But it was better than the best.

1439
01:21:55,902 --> 01:21:57,660
She figured out I was Aladdin.

1440
01:21:57,745 --> 01:21:58,987
You said that wouldn't happen.

1441
01:21:59,035 --> 01:21:59,932
Wow.

1442
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:03,261
I mean, genie magic is
really just a facade.

1443
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:04,299
At some point,

1444
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:06,863
the real character's always
gonna shine through.

1445
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,512
But that's a good thing, right?
Now, she knows.

1446
01:22:09,683 --> 01:22:11,908
- Well...
- Well, what?

1447
01:22:11,933 --> 01:22:14,588
He told me he was only pretending
to be a thief to see the city.

1448
01:22:14,613 --> 01:22:16,597
But he's actually a prince.

1449
01:22:16,622 --> 01:22:19,058
I convinced her that
I really was a prince.

1450
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:20,433
And you believed him?

1451
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,613
And she believed you?

1452
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:22,676
I think so.

1453
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,909
Eventually, you are going
to have to tell her the truth.

1454
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:29,730
Eventually, I will tell her.

1455
01:22:30,668 --> 01:22:31,996
Anyway,

1456
01:22:32,409 --> 01:22:34,074
I sort of am a prince now.

1457
01:22:34,558 --> 01:22:35,619
Oh.

1458
01:22:35,644 --> 01:22:38,183
So you're gonna drink
from that cup.

1459
01:22:39,624 --> 01:22:41,554
You don't think maybe
you want to believe him

1460
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:42,952
because you have to
marry a prince

1461
01:22:42,977 --> 01:22:44,593
but you can't marry a thief?

1462
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:45,757
No.

1463
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:47,843
I believe him.

1464
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,265
I do.

1465
01:22:56,869 --> 01:22:58,119
When the time is right,

1466
01:22:58,486 --> 01:22:59,674
I will tell her.

1467
01:23:04,749 --> 01:23:05,772
Morning?

1468
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:07,375
Morning.

1469
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:11,918
Not again.

1470
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,597
Please, please, I...

1471
01:23:18,573 --> 01:23:19,683
Gentlemen.

1472
01:23:19,768 --> 01:23:22,042
I-I think there's been
some sort of confusion.

1473
01:23:22,112 --> 01:23:23,698
I don't think
you know who I am.

1474
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,409
Oh, no, no.
I know who you are.

1475
01:23:27,376 --> 01:23:28,385
Aladdin.

1476
01:23:28,697 --> 01:23:29,885
Aladdin?

1477
01:23:30,448 --> 01:23:31,487
Aladdin.

1478
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:33,416
I don't know who that is.
I-I'm Prince Ali...

1479
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:34,442
Street rat.

1480
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:35,467
Of-Of Ababwah.

1481
01:23:35,492 --> 01:23:37,325
A prince from a kingdom
that doesn't exist.

1482
01:23:37,786 --> 01:23:40,371
Who now possesses
a magic carpet

1483
01:23:40,426 --> 01:23:42,177
from the Cave of Wonders.

1484
01:23:42,202 --> 01:23:43,870
Seems to me,
the only way that's possible,

1485
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:45,231
Where's your monkey?

1486
01:23:45,256 --> 01:23:47,129
Is if you found a certain treasure.

1487
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:50,114
My treasure.

1488
01:23:51,177 --> 01:23:52,504
Where's the lamp?

1489
01:24:00,475 --> 01:24:03,092
This clearly, is some sort
of misunderstanding.

1490
01:24:03,202 --> 01:24:04,349
I'm Prince Ali.

1491
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:06,366
If I throw you off
of that balcony,

1492
01:24:07,053 --> 01:24:09,163
and you are who
you say you are,

1493
01:24:10,405 --> 01:24:12,795
you will die a watery death.

1494
01:24:14,186 --> 01:24:15,384
If you survive,

1495
01:24:15,977 --> 01:24:17,803
it can only be
because of the lamp.

1496
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:21,251
In which case,
I will have my answer.

1497
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,126
For the last time...

1498
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:30,822
Where is the lamp?

1499
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,548
Listen to me.

1500
01:24:33,774 --> 01:24:35,298
I don't know who you think I am.

1501
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:36,884
- Goodbye, Aladdin.
- No!

1502
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:01,996
Hmm.

1503
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:43,922
What in the...?

1504
01:25:45,157 --> 01:25:47,609
Oh! Hey, kid! Okay.

1505
01:25:47,868 --> 01:25:49,915
I can't get you out of this
unless you make a wish.

1506
01:25:50,016 --> 01:25:51,289
You have to make a wish!

1507
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:53,024
Come on, wake up!

1508
01:25:53,049 --> 01:25:54,508
Okay, try and form the words.

1509
01:25:54,562 --> 01:25:56,031
"I wish."

1510
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,829
Kid, come on, wake up!

1511
01:25:58,914 --> 01:25:59,914
Wake up.

1512
01:26:00,047 --> 01:26:01,813
You need to think.
Think, think.

1513
01:26:03,047 --> 01:26:04,047
Think.

1514
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:05,821
Okay. Okay.

1515
01:26:05,846 --> 01:26:08,071
A little gray area here,
but it's worth a try.

1516
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:12,266
I, Aladdin, being of
sound body and mind,

1517
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:14,008
declare that my second wish

1518
01:26:14,033 --> 01:26:15,985
is to be saved from
certain doom.

1519
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,031
I took the liberty to
backdate that a day.

1520
01:26:18,063 --> 01:26:19,241
I hope you don't mind.

1521
01:26:19,266 --> 01:26:20,571
Yes! Here we go!
Come on!

1522
01:26:32,032 --> 01:26:33,672
Come on, kid! Kid!

1523
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:35,703
Kid, please. Come on.
Wake up.

1524
01:26:35,961 --> 01:26:37,883
Wake up, wake up. Kid!

1525
01:26:38,547 --> 01:26:40,742
Wake up, please.

1526
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Ew.

1527
01:26:45,543 --> 01:26:48,574
Probably coulda done that
the other direction though.

1528
01:26:52,512 --> 01:26:53,652
How you doin'?

1529
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:55,426
Thanks, Genie.

1530
01:26:55,754 --> 01:26:58,723
Hey, no problem, uh,
I was in the neighborhood.

1531
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,090
I thought you said no favors?

1532
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:02,309
I wa-I wa...

1533
01:27:02,402 --> 01:27:03,715
I thought you said no friends?

1534
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,645
Right, uh...

1535
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:07,910
It actually cost you a wish.

1536
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,410
Whatever it cost.

1537
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:14,277
You saved my life.

1538
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,629
Yeah, that's true.

1539
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:19,020
I mean, strictly speaking though,
it was a team effort.

1540
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:23,828
Thank you.

1541
01:27:26,192 --> 01:27:27,723
We have to stop Jafar.

1542
01:27:28,277 --> 01:27:29,840
That's not gonna be easy.

1543
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:32,020
The Sultan trusts him completely.

1544
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:34,309
He has everybody fooled.

1545
01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:37,761
Maybe not everyone.

1546
01:27:40,604 --> 01:27:42,948
I overheard Prince Ali
talking to his advisor

1547
01:27:42,973 --> 01:27:45,643
about returning with an
army to conquer Agrabah.

1548
01:27:45,668 --> 01:27:46,729
What?

1549
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:48,912
Now it appears
he's fled in the night.

1550
01:27:50,955 --> 01:27:51,979
Jasmine.

1551
01:27:54,448 --> 01:27:55,946
You heard him say this, Jafar?

1552
01:27:55,978 --> 01:27:57,549
And you saw him leave?

1553
01:27:57,574 --> 01:27:58,432
Uh-oh.

1554
01:27:58,457 --> 01:27:59,453
Yes.

1555
01:27:59,478 --> 01:28:02,151
With my own ears
and my own eyes.

1556
01:28:02,424 --> 01:28:05,549
So, what's the problem now,
Princess?

1557
01:28:06,432 --> 01:28:08,979
This is the problem, Jafar.

1558
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,041
If what you say is true,

1559
01:28:11,074 --> 01:28:13,143
why is Prince Ali still here?

1560
01:28:13,206 --> 01:28:14,518
Your Majesty.

1561
01:28:15,463 --> 01:28:17,112
Prince Ali.

1562
01:28:18,729 --> 01:28:20,048
This is a surprise.

1563
01:28:20,073 --> 01:28:22,752
Your Highness, your advisor's
not who he says he is.

1564
01:28:23,104 --> 01:28:24,197
Oh.

1565
01:28:24,275 --> 01:28:25,814
I'm not who I say I am.

1566
01:28:25,893 --> 01:28:26,993
Baba,

1567
01:28:27,018 --> 01:28:29,549
he tried to kill Prince Ali.

1568
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:33,088
Jafar, can you explain this to me?

1569
01:28:34,299 --> 01:28:35,377
Yes.

1570
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:38,963
My Sultan...

1571
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:44,424
You know my loyalty
belongs to you.

1572
01:28:46,849 --> 01:28:48,544
Your loyalty.

1573
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:51,497
Your loyalty.

1574
01:28:52,044 --> 01:28:53,200
Yes.

1575
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:59,372
Prince Ali, you invited
yourself into our city.

1576
01:28:59,419 --> 01:29:01,591
And we welcomed you
as our guest.

1577
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:05,106
But I believe your intentions are...

1578
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:09,880
deceitful.

1579
01:29:10,302 --> 01:29:12,159
You are a grave
danger to Agrabah,

1580
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:13,776
and you shall be
dealt with as such.

1581
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,567
Baba, what are you saying?

1582
01:29:15,614 --> 01:29:17,052
Enough, Jasmine!

1583
01:29:17,661 --> 01:29:21,458
Jafar told me
of Prince Ali's ambition.

1584
01:29:21,614 --> 01:29:22,614
The staff.

1585
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:23,880
He's here for my throne.

1586
01:29:24,153 --> 01:29:25,309
Hakim!

1587
01:29:34,919 --> 01:29:36,075
Baba?

1588
01:29:37,513 --> 01:29:38,644
What happened?

1589
01:29:38,669 --> 01:29:39,917
He had you under a spell.

1590
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:41,177
He's not to be trusted.

1591
01:29:41,599 --> 01:29:42,620
Your Majesty.

1592
01:29:42,645 --> 01:29:43,778
He wants your throne.

1593
01:29:43,848 --> 01:29:47,777
Jafar, you were my
most trusted advisor!

1594
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:49,691
Hakim!

1595
01:29:50,035 --> 01:29:51,676
Put him in the dungeon!

1596
01:29:59,764 --> 01:30:01,779
You should think
about how quickly

1597
01:30:01,842 --> 01:30:05,530
the sands of power shift
in the storm, Hakim.

1598
01:30:05,772 --> 01:30:08,014
I am loyal to my sultan.

1599
01:30:09,014 --> 01:30:10,787
As you should have been.

1600
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:15,733
The law is the law.

1601
01:30:31,355 --> 01:30:32,683
Prince Ali,

1602
01:30:32,988 --> 01:30:35,004
I must apologize.

1603
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:38,066
Well, Your Highness,
there's something I...

1604
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,672
I'd like to explain.

1605
01:30:39,697 --> 01:30:41,167
Your honor and integrity

1606
01:30:41,192 --> 01:30:44,200
will never again be
questioned here in Agrabah.

1607
01:30:45,582 --> 01:30:46,644
- I...
- A more noble

1608
01:30:46,669 --> 01:30:49,246
and sincere young man
has never graced

1609
01:30:49,332 --> 01:30:51,496
the chambers of this palace.

1610
01:30:51,566 --> 01:30:53,316
- Well, uh...
- Wow.

1611
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:55,269
I would be honored

1612
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:58,207
- to call you my son.
- Oooh.

1613
01:30:58,457 --> 01:31:00,051
If that...

1614
01:31:00,379 --> 01:31:02,652
were something anyone wanted.

1615
01:31:03,801 --> 01:31:05,346
So you got the girl.

1616
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:08,230
I mean, trust me, I had
my doubts after your whole

1617
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:09,621
jam debacle.

1618
01:31:09,646 --> 01:31:12,996
But y-you pulled yourself
back together a little bit.

1619
01:31:13,418 --> 01:31:14,754
I did, didn't I?

1620
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:16,824
I think I finally got the
hang of being a prince.

1621
01:31:16,902 --> 01:31:18,955
Oh, well, that-that's
not exactly what I meant.

1622
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,090
But you were right.

1623
01:31:20,191 --> 01:31:21,683
People see what they wanna see.

1624
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:23,215
Aladdin is gone.

1625
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,441
I'm Prince Ali now.

1626
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:25,512
Wow.

1627
01:31:25,537 --> 01:31:27,535
Got it all figured out now,
huh, kid?

1628
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,441
And you know, I was thinking
about my last wish,

1629
01:31:29,488 --> 01:31:30,973
and I just...

1630
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:33,083
I can't do this without you.

1631
01:31:33,146 --> 01:31:34,841
I know I told you
I'd use it to set you free,

1632
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,130
but you heard the sultan.

1633
01:31:36,155 --> 01:31:38,016
I can't let everything that
we've worked for fall apart.

1634
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,040
So...

1635
01:31:39,172 --> 01:31:41,797
You just never
tell her the truth?

1636
01:31:41,822 --> 01:31:43,243
You're gonna keep
living the lie?

1637
01:31:43,268 --> 01:31:45,329
It's not a lie.
People can change.

1638
01:31:45,461 --> 01:31:47,594
Heh, oh, they can change, all right.

1639
01:31:48,984 --> 01:31:51,328
And? That's a bad thing?

1640
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,516
Everything's better now.
No one got hurt.

1641
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,828
You'd rather me
be back on the streets

1642
01:31:54,852 --> 01:31:56,899
stealing to survive? I...

1643
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:59,117
thought you'd be happy for me.

1644
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:01,251
But all you cared about was that

1645
01:32:01,275 --> 01:32:03,563
I use my last wish
to set you free.

1646
01:32:03,993 --> 01:32:05,907
Wow. Kid,

1647
01:32:06,219 --> 01:32:07,852
I don't care
nothin' about that wish.

1648
01:32:08,266 --> 01:32:09,719
This is about you.

1649
01:32:09,766 --> 01:32:11,649
What's happening to you.

1650
01:32:11,852 --> 01:32:14,438
You'd rather lie
to somebody you love

1651
01:32:14,463 --> 01:32:16,321
than give all of this up.

1652
01:32:16,446 --> 01:32:17,774
You don't get it, Genie.

1653
01:32:18,485 --> 01:32:19,726
People like me

1654
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:22,290
don't get anything
except by pretending.

1655
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:25,774
I think, maybe,
you don't get it.

1656
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:29,649
The more you gain
by pretending,

1657
01:32:29,727 --> 01:32:32,047
the less you're
actually gonna have.

1658
01:32:32,696 --> 01:32:34,266
10,000 years,

1659
01:32:34,291 --> 01:32:37,001
I have never once, ever...

1660
01:32:37,368 --> 01:32:39,883
called a master a friend.

1661
01:32:40,844 --> 01:32:42,344
I broke the rules for you.

1662
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,993
I saved your life...

1663
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:45,469
and for what?

1664
01:32:45,656 --> 01:32:48,376
You are breaking
my heart here, kid.

1665
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:50,515
You're breaking my heart.

1666
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,602
Genie, no. Hey, come on!

1667
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:11,994
Master.

1668
01:33:14,314 --> 01:33:15,846
Who does he think he is?

1669
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:17,611
He's supposed to serve me.

1670
01:33:17,838 --> 01:33:20,588
I'm the same as I always was
on the inside, right, Abu?

1671
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:26,588
Hey!

1672
01:33:47,236 --> 01:33:49,337
Aah! Are you kidding?

1673
01:33:49,479 --> 01:33:51,908
Now, why would you rub
the thing under the...?

1674
01:33:52,408 --> 01:33:53,861
Archway.

1675
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:03,586
Riffraff.

1676
01:34:04,274 --> 01:34:05,485

You should have left Agrabah
while you had the chance.

1692
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,086
Why leave when the city
belongs to me now?

1693
01:35:05,126 --> 01:35:06,376
It's over, Jafar.

1694
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:07,626
Over for you.

1695
01:35:07,651 --> 01:35:11,354
I've endured your spineless
incompetence for long enough.

1696
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:12,485
Hakim.

1697
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:13,806
Own throne.

1698
01:35:24,615 --> 01:35:25,873
Genie!

1699
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:27,926
For my first wish,

1700
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:30,552
I wish to be Sultan of Agrabah.

1701
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:31,577
What?

1702
01:35:32,467 --> 01:35:33,740
As you wish, master.

1703
01:35:33,826 --> 01:35:34,834
No.

1704
01:36:10,337 --> 01:36:11,493
Hakim!

1705
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:13,267
Hakim!

1706
01:36:13,798 --> 01:36:15,517
You obey the sultan.

1707
01:36:16,126 --> 01:36:18,025
So you obey me now.

1708
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:25,791
You know the law, Hakim.

1709
01:36:30,837 --> 01:36:31,853
No.

1710
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:36,829
My Sultan!

Marshal an army
to invade Sherabad.

1714
01:36:44,626 --> 01:36:45,884
- Sherabad?
- You cannot...

1715
01:36:45,909 --> 01:36:47,993
I think we've heard
enough from you, Princess.

1716
01:36:48,018 --> 01:36:50,665
It's time you start doing what
you should've done all along.

1717
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:52,369
Stay silent.

1718
01:36:53,134 --> 01:36:54,283
Guards!

1719
01:36:54,361 --> 01:36:55,830
Remove her!

know what's good for you.

1722

Rajah.

1723
01:37:10,142 --> 01:37:11,259
It's all right.

1724
01:37:17,517 --> 01:37:19,501

- Baba.

Hakim!

1760
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,437
Take her away!

1761
01:39:51,312 --> 01:39:52,781
Tell them, Hakim.

1762
01:40:01,852 --> 01:40:03,391
You were just a boy

1763
01:40:04,274 --> 01:40:06,313
when your father came
to work the grounds.

1764
01:40:07,938 --> 01:40:09,258
But you have risen up

1765
01:40:09,283 --> 01:40:12,251
to become our
most trusted soldier.

1766
01:40:12,688 --> 01:40:16,469
As a man, I know you to be
both loyal and just.

1767
01:40:17,868 --> 01:40:19,813
But now, you have to choose.

1768
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:23,079
Duty isn't always honor.

1769
01:40:23,305 --> 01:40:25,031
Our greatest challenge

1770
01:40:25,056 --> 01:40:27,531
isn't speaking up
against our enemies,

1771
01:40:28,243 --> 01:40:32,126
but defying those whose
approval we seek the most.

1772
01:40:32,656 --> 01:40:35,757
Jafar is not worthy
of your admiration

1773
01:40:35,782 --> 01:40:37,234
nor your sacrifice.

1774
01:40:37,327 --> 01:40:41,624
I wish nothing but glory
for the Kingdom of Agrabah.

1775
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:42,649
No.

1776
01:40:43,038 --> 01:40:45,077
You seek glory for yourself.

1777
01:40:45,585 --> 01:40:48,570
And you would win it
off the backs of my people!

1778
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:50,812
Hakim.

1779
01:40:51,218 --> 01:40:52,617
These men,

1780
01:40:52,749 --> 01:40:55,991
they will follow where you lead,
but it's up to you.

1781
01:40:56,085 --> 01:40:57,522
Will you stand silent

1782
01:40:57,547 --> 01:40:59,880
while Jafar destroys
our beloved kingdom?

1783
01:40:59,905 --> 01:41:01,687
Or will you do what is right...

1784
01:41:06,679 --> 01:41:09,585
And stand with the
people of Agrabah?

1785
01:41:21,161 --> 01:41:23,145
My Princess.

1786
01:41:25,231 --> 01:41:26,489
Forgive me.

1787
01:41:28,512 --> 01:41:29,887
My Sultan.

1788
01:41:34,715 --> 01:41:35,989
Hakim.

1789
01:41:37,778 --> 01:41:40,489
Guards! Arrest the Vizier.

1790
01:41:43,403 --> 01:41:44,504
Rub the lamp.

1791
01:41:44,692 --> 01:41:46,731
So this is how it will be.

1792
01:41:47,442 --> 01:41:48,949
Not even the title of sultan

1793
01:41:48,974 --> 01:41:50,958
would wake the herd
from their sleep.

1794
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,911
I should have known.

1795
01:41:53,325 --> 01:41:55,434
If you won't bow
before a sultan,

1796
01:41:55,942 --> 01:41:57,989
you will cower
before a sorcerer.

1797
01:41:58,286 --> 01:41:59,504
Genie!

1798
01:41:59,606 --> 01:42:02,825
I wish to become the most
powerful sorcerer there is.

1799
01:42:03,356 --> 01:42:05,012
As you wish, master.

1800
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:31,553
This could be fun.

1801
01:42:33,327 --> 01:42:34,483
Hakim.

1802
01:42:34,795 --> 01:42:36,928
I had such big plans for you.

1803
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:39,311
But now...

1804
01:42:41,037 --> 01:42:43,178
you are no longer
of any use to me.

1805
01:42:43,717 --> 01:42:46,405
Perhaps your men would like
to follow you to the dungeon.

1806
01:42:48,764 --> 01:42:49,928
You too.

1807
01:42:52,819 --> 01:42:53,983
Prince Ali!

1808
01:42:56,418 --> 01:42:58,534
If it isn't our Prince Ali...

1809
01:42:58,559 --> 01:42:59,620
Ali!

1810
01:42:59,645 --> 01:43:00,887
Or should I say...

1811
01:43:06,248 --> 01:43:07,436
Aladdin.

1812
01:43:10,295 --> 01:43:11,389
Aladdin.

1813
01:43:11,436 --> 01:43:13,740
He's been pretending
the entire time.

1814
01:43:14,013 --> 01:43:15,264
An impostor.

1815
01:43:15,592 --> 01:43:17,639
There is no Prince Ali.

1816
01:43:17,764 --> 01:43:19,022
There never was.

1817
01:43:19,091 --> 01:43:21,373
He's nothing but a lying thief.

1818
01:43:21,398 --> 01:43:22,656
I'm sorry.

1819
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,162
You're insignificant.

1820
01:43:24,187 --> 01:43:27,389
An irritation I no longer
need to tolerate once I...

1821
01:43:27,454 --> 01:43:30,438
ensure your agonizing death by

1822
01:43:30,532 --> 01:43:32,860
banishing you to the
ends of the earth.

1823
01:43:33,172 --> 01:43:34,172
No!

1824
01:43:53,182 --> 01:43:54,197
No.

1825
01:43:54,533 --> 01:43:55,596
No.

1826
01:43:58,877 --> 01:43:59,955
No.

1827
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:02,782
Abu!

1828
01:44:05,291 --> 01:44:07,564
I could simply kill you all.

1829
01:44:08,392 --> 01:44:11,236
But that would be inadequate
repayment for years of

1830
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:13,353
humiliation and neglect.

1831
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:15,767
"Remember your place, Jafar."

1832
01:44:16,517 --> 01:44:18,486
"You forget yourself, Jafar."

1833
01:44:18,971 --> 01:44:20,588
- Jafar.
- No.

1834
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:22,236
What you need,

1835
01:44:22,261 --> 01:44:23,385
Baba,

1836
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:24,650
is to suffer.

1837
01:44:24,978 --> 01:44:26,134
Like I have suffered.

1838
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,159
Baba?

1839
01:44:27,247 --> 01:44:29,512
Watching me rule your
kingdom be enough?

1840
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,700
Stop!

1841
01:44:30,725 --> 01:44:33,434
But watching my armies devour
your toothless allies...

1842
01:44:33,459 --> 01:44:34,958
Please, make it stop!

1843
01:44:34,983 --> 01:44:37,778
No, the most suitable punishment
would be to make you watch

1844
01:44:37,803 --> 01:44:40,989
- while I take what you love most.
- No!

1845
01:44:41,582 --> 01:44:43,270
- Baba!
- And marry your daughter.

1846
01:44:43,567 --> 01:44:44,590
No!

1847
01:44:45,817 --> 01:44:46,895
No!

1848
01:44:47,934 --> 01:44:50,778
She will never marry you.

1849
01:44:56,919 --> 01:44:58,380
I will do as you wish!

1850
01:44:59,528 --> 01:45:00,966
Make it stop!

1851
01:45:03,966 --> 01:45:05,442
Make it stop.

1852
01:45:16,819 --> 01:45:17,842
Abu!

1853
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:21,381
Abu!

1854
01:45:23,178 --> 01:45:24,397
Abu!

1855
01:45:38,767 --> 01:45:39,923
You okay?

1856
01:45:41,329 --> 01:45:42,447
Let's get outta here.

1857
01:45:44,353 --> 01:45:45,353
No.

1858
01:46:15,163 --> 01:46:16,827
Your Highness, Sultan.

1859
01:46:17,006 --> 01:46:19,014
In honesty and sincerity,

1860
01:46:19,436 --> 01:46:21,663
- do you accept Princess Jasmine...
- Yes.

1861
01:46:22,811 --> 01:46:24,671
Yes, I accept.

1862
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:26,608
Princess.

1863
01:46:27,288 --> 01:46:31,639
Princess Jasmine, do you accept
the Sultan to be your husband?

1864
01:46:36,944 --> 01:46:38,561
Come on, woman!

1865
01:46:39,841 --> 01:46:40,841
Accept.

1866
01:46:40,866 --> 01:46:41,999
I...

1867
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,014
Yes?

1868
01:46:48,725 --> 01:46:49,733
I...

1869
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,600
Do not!

1870
01:46:53,632 --> 01:46:56,061
- The lamp, the lamp!
- Ah! Stop her!

1871
01:46:56,225 --> 01:46:57,514
No, Jasmine!

1872
01:46:57,539 --> 01:46:58,694
No!

1873
01:46:58,975 --> 01:47:00,960
No! No!

1874
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:08,856
The lamp! Iago!

1875
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:10,754
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

1876
01:47:22,137 --> 01:47:23,145
Hold on!

1877
01:47:28,997 --> 01:47:30,184
The lamp!

1878
01:47:30,559 --> 01:47:31,567
Abu!

1879
01:48:01,052 --> 01:48:02,310
Carpet, get me up there!

1880
01:48:05,654 --> 01:48:06,654
Abu!

1881
01:48:11,005 --> 01:48:12,012
Jump!

1882
01:48:40,314 --> 01:48:42,884
You are nothing
without your staff!

1883
01:48:43,282 --> 01:48:44,525
Nothing!

1884
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:21,865
Carpet!

1885
01:49:34,219 --> 01:49:35,227
Jasmine.

1886
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:41,664
Punish them. Punish them.

1887
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:46,027
Genie should witness.

1888
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:53,722
As the old man said,

1889
01:49:53,839 --> 01:49:55,999
"You should have left Agrabah
when you had the chance."

1890
01:50:06,744 --> 01:50:09,244
I told you before to think bigger.

1891
01:50:09,385 --> 01:50:11,994
You could have been the most
powerful man in the room.

1892
01:50:12,104 --> 01:50:14,213
But now, I hold the lamp.

1893
01:50:14,283 --> 01:50:16,393
I hold the power.

1894
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:23,135
You can't find what you're
looking for in that lamp, Jafar.

1895
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,017
I tried and failed,
and so will you.

1896
01:50:26,057 --> 01:50:27,221
You think so?

1897
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:29,010
But I am Sultan!

1898
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:32,440
I am the greatest sorcerer
the world has ever seen.

1899
01:50:32,729 --> 01:50:36,455
I will create an empire
that history cannot ignore.

1900
01:50:37,299 --> 01:50:40,830
I... can destroy cities.

1901
01:50:41,612 --> 01:50:44,533
I can destroy kingdoms!

1902
01:50:49,681 --> 01:50:52,595
And I can destroy you.

1903
01:50:52,651 --> 01:50:53,955
True.

1904
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:55,471
But who made you a sultan?

1905
01:50:56,752 --> 01:50:58,190
Who made you a sorcerer?

1906
01:50:58,767 --> 01:51:02,790
There will always be some thing,
some man, some being

1907
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:04,869
- more powerful than you.
- What are you doing?

1908
01:51:04,947 --> 01:51:06,455
Genie gave you your power,

1909
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:07,791
and he can take it away.

1910
01:51:07,854 --> 01:51:09,752
- He serves me!
- For now.

1911
01:51:09,777 --> 01:51:12,026
But you'll never have
more power than the genie.

1912
01:51:17,043 --> 01:51:18,689
You said it yourself...

1913
01:51:19,299 --> 01:51:22,182
You're either the most
powerful in the room

1914
01:51:22,207 --> 01:51:24,073
or you're nothing.

1915
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:27,073
You will always

1916
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:28,541
be second.

1917
01:51:28,658 --> 01:51:29,775
Second.

1918
01:51:30,151 --> 01:51:31,181
Second!

1919
01:51:34,026 --> 01:51:35,096
Second?!

1920
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:37,362
Only second?

1921
01:51:37,869 --> 01:51:39,580
He serves me!

1922
01:51:42,283 --> 01:51:46,252
I will make sure no one will
ever say these words again!

1923
01:51:46,377 --> 01:51:47,557
Genie!

1924
01:51:48,229 --> 01:51:49,931
For my final wish,
I wish to become

1925
01:51:49,956 --> 01:51:52,869
the most powerful
being in the universe!

1926
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:54,791
More powerful than you!

1927
01:51:55,682 --> 01:51:58,143
A lotta gray area in that wish,

1928
01:51:58,168 --> 01:51:59,604
but, uh...

1929
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:03,002
The most powerful being
in the universe!

1930
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:04,893
Coming right up!

1931
01:52:29,782 --> 01:52:32,016
The most powerful in the universe!

1932
01:52:32,344 --> 01:52:33,618
At last!

1933
01:52:33,852 --> 01:52:35,915
Second to no one!

1934
01:52:36,266 --> 01:52:39,157
And I thought
I had power before!

1935
01:52:39,657 --> 01:52:40,836
First...

1936
01:52:40,891 --> 01:52:44,204
I'll lay waste to those
fools in Sherabad.

1937
01:52:59,506 --> 01:53:00,951
What have you done to me?

1938
01:53:00,990 --> 01:53:02,841
I haven't done
anything to you, Jafar.

1939
01:53:02,866 --> 01:53:04,724
What have you done to me?!

1940
01:53:05,021 --> 01:53:06,716
This was your wish, not mine.

1941
01:53:07,545 --> 01:53:09,966
A genie might have
phenomenal cosmic powers...

1942
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:12,584
But an itty-bitty living space.

1943
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:15,584
You see, a genie
without a master,

1944
01:53:15,631 --> 01:53:17,865
goes back in their lamp.

1945
01:53:22,568 --> 01:53:24,497
I will not forget you, boy!

1946
01:53:24,522 --> 01:53:25,653
Mark my words.

1947
01:53:25,678 --> 01:53:28,310
I will not forget what
you have done to me.

1948
01:53:28,335 --> 01:53:29,388
Goodbye, Jafar.

1949
01:53:29,521 --> 01:53:31,912
Parrot! You're coming with me!

1950
01:53:33,585 --> 01:53:34,694
No!

1951
01:53:50,217 --> 01:53:51,217
Baba!

1952
01:53:51,686 --> 01:53:52,843
- Baba.
- Come on.

1953
01:53:52,874 --> 01:53:54,826
A couple thousand years
in the Cave of Wonders

1954
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:56,491
ought to cool you off.

1955
01:54:07,561 --> 01:54:09,944
Wait... wait.

1956
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:12,085
How can I ever thank you?

1957
01:54:12,327 --> 01:54:15,889
Oh, no, no.
You don't need to thank me.

1958
01:54:16,405 --> 01:54:18,764
But I hope you
accept my apology.

1959
01:54:19,046 --> 01:54:22,038
I'm sorry...
to the both of you.

1960
01:54:22,827 --> 01:54:24,108
Especially you.

1961
01:54:24,304 --> 01:54:25,780
You deserve...

1962
01:54:26,577 --> 01:54:27,905
so much.

1963
01:54:28,882 --> 01:54:30,608
We all make mistakes.

1964
01:54:34,444 --> 01:54:35,468
Aladdin.

1965
01:54:38,866 --> 01:54:40,725
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1966
01:54:46,624 --> 01:54:49,163
Ooh, that's a bit of a mess
there, Abu.

1967
01:54:49,225 --> 01:54:50,827
Let me take care
of that for you.

1968
01:54:58,545 --> 01:54:59,592
Cute.

1969
01:55:00,225 --> 01:55:03,647
Ah-ah-ah. No.
No long faces, all right?

1970
01:55:03,701 --> 01:55:05,592
I got an idea, all right?

1971
01:55:05,617 --> 01:55:07,147
It's your last wish.

1972
01:55:07,272 --> 01:55:09,764
Royalty was the
right idea, okay?

1973
01:55:09,803 --> 01:55:11,678
We should just
rip on that a little bit.

1974
01:55:11,703 --> 01:55:13,553
All right,
here's what I'm thinkin'.

1975
01:55:14,569 --> 01:55:17,319
Aladdin, warrior prince!

1976
01:55:17,428 --> 01:55:21,233
A noble heart in a land
where thieves run feral.

1977
01:55:21,975 --> 01:55:24,889
Jasmine!

1978
01:55:25,631 --> 01:55:26,921
You like it?

1979
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:29,921
No? Okay, all right.
I hear you loud and clear.

1980
01:55:30,053 --> 01:55:31,819
But this is what you need.

1981
01:55:32,014 --> 01:55:34,928
The governing laws of
Agrabah by royal decree.

1982
01:55:35,077 --> 01:55:37,280
Okay, and... here it is!

1983
01:55:37,335 --> 01:55:39,366
"Must marry a prince."

1984
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:41,600
Right. But, you say the words...

1985
01:55:41,646 --> 01:55:44,841
and this law just kinda like,
goes away.

1986
01:55:44,905 --> 01:55:46,288
You and the princess

1987
01:55:46,327 --> 01:55:48,335
are in it together forever.

1988
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,521
You can just
make the law disappear?

1989
01:55:50,546 --> 01:55:51,928
Psshh. Please.

1990
01:55:51,953 --> 01:55:53,537
Like it never existed.

1991
01:55:54,483 --> 01:55:56,747
All right. Last wish.
Let's get it.

1992
01:55:56,772 --> 01:55:57,897
Okay.

1993
01:55:58,444 --> 01:55:59,835
Last wish.

1994
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,037
Genie.

1995
01:56:02,062 --> 01:56:03,601
I'm ready. Hold on.
Here we go.

1996
01:56:06,108 --> 01:56:07,280
I wish...

1997
01:56:07,342 --> 01:56:09,553
Third and final wish.

1998
01:56:09,639 --> 01:56:11,038
I wish...

1999
01:56:11,936 --> 01:56:13,397
To set you free.

2000
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:15,280
What?

2001
01:56:20,146 --> 01:56:21,154
Whoa.

2002
01:56:22,099 --> 01:56:23,099
Oh!

2003
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,100
Wait.

2004
01:56:37,069 --> 01:56:38,077
Am I...

2005
01:56:45,288 --> 01:56:47,358
Wait, wait, um...

2006
01:56:47,608 --> 01:56:48,983
Tell-Tell me to do somethin'.

2007
01:56:49,008 --> 01:56:51,381
Um... give me some jams.

2008
01:56:53,037 --> 01:56:54,521
Get it yourself?

2009
01:56:57,272 --> 01:56:58,624
Get your own jams!

2010
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,217
Thank you.

2011
01:57:06,803 --> 01:57:07,803
Thank you.

2012
01:57:08,053 --> 01:57:09,225
No.

2013
01:57:09,334 --> 01:57:10,796
Thank you, Genie.

2014
01:57:11,202 --> 01:57:12,756
I owe you everything.

2015
01:57:16,014 --> 01:57:17,624
What are you gonna do now?

2016
01:57:19,413 --> 01:57:20,428
Um...

2017
01:57:23,233 --> 01:57:24,983
Actually, there is this...

2018
01:57:25,608 --> 01:57:26,874
handmaiden

2019
01:57:28,186 --> 01:57:31,436
that I would love
to travel the world with.

2020
01:57:33,468 --> 01:57:34,937
If she'll have me.

2021
01:57:38,123 --> 01:57:40,653
When do we leave?
Also, I want children.

2022
01:57:40,678 --> 01:57:42,248
Yes! Two of them.

2023
01:57:42,576 --> 01:57:44,850
Lian and Omar,
three years apart.

2024
01:57:44,912 --> 01:57:47,467
They will worship us both
and ask lots of questions.

2025
01:57:47,492 --> 01:57:50,295
And you will entertain them
with stories and songs.

2026
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,139
- We'll have a boat.
- A large one

2027
01:57:53,164 --> 01:57:55,756
with multiple levels
and magnificent sails.

2028
01:57:55,781 --> 01:57:57,620
I was thinking more of a-
a smaller one.

2029
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,668
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

2030
01:58:00,975 --> 01:58:03,116
Sit with me, my child.

2031
01:58:04,534 --> 01:58:05,565
I'm sorry.

2032
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:07,995
- Baba, why are you...?
- Please, let me finish.

2033
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:10,814
I feared losing you.

2034
01:58:11,861 --> 01:58:13,595
Like I lost your mother.

2035
01:58:14,103 --> 01:58:16,760
All I saw was my little girl.

2036
01:58:16,892 --> 01:58:18,908
Not the woman you have become.

2037
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,056
You have shown me

2038
01:58:21,142 --> 01:58:22,627
courage

2039
01:58:22,728 --> 01:58:24,017
and strength.

2040
01:58:24,356 --> 01:58:25,715
You...

2041
01:58:26,566 --> 01:58:28,965
are the future of Agrabah.

2042
01:58:35,050 --> 01:58:36,409
You...

2043
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:40,019
shall be the next sultan.

2044
01:58:49,003 --> 01:58:50,792
Thank you, Baba.

2045
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:54,039
As sultan,
you may change the law.

2046
01:58:55,644 --> 01:58:57,261
He is a good man.

2047
01:59:04,364 --> 01:59:05,786
Where'd he go?

2048
01:59:33,926 --> 01:59:34,973
Stop, thief.

2049
01:59:35,286 --> 01:59:36,715
Your sultan commands it.

2050
01:59:41,442 --> 01:59:42,629
Sultan?

2051
01:59:44,387 --> 01:59:46,262
Does that mean I'm in trouble?

2052
01:59:49,762 --> 01:59:51,645
Only because you got caught.

2053
02:01:02,917 --> 02:01:04,730
♪ Can your friends do this? ♪

2054
02:02:07,458 --> 02:02:08,928
