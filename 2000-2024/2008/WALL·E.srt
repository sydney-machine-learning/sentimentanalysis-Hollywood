192
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:32,797

195
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:35,463
I've been in my cabin all morning,

196
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:39,093
so let's hover over to the driving range
and hit a few virtual balls into space.

197
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,699
No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

198
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,573
- Well, then what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Something.

199
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,378
Whoa!

200
00:39:55,386 --> 00:39:59,152
Look, I'm tired of having
the same argument over and over.

201
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:09,029

216
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,047
WALL-E.

Date?

234
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:53,464
Don't get me started
on the date.

235
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:57,166
Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

00:41:57,274 --> 00:42:02,109
If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

237
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:04,010
There are no good men out there.

<i>Go to full autopilot.</i>

547
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:56,690
<i>Take control of everything,</i>
<i>and do not return to Earth.</i>

548
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:58,987
<i>Repeat, do not return to Earth.</i>

549
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:00,628
<i> Let's get</i>
<i>the heck out of here.</i>

550
01:09:05,101 --> 01:09:07,365
Now, the plant.

551
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:09,438
No. Wait a minute.

552
01:09:09,538 --> 01:09:11,904
Computer, when was that message
sent out to the <i>Axiom?</i>

553
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:14,441
<i>Message received</i>
<i>in the year 2110.</i>

554
01:09:14,543 --> 01:09:17,944
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

555
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:21,073
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

556
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:23,845
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

557
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:28,890
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

558
01:09:28,991 --> 01:09:32,324
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

559
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:36,421
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

560
01:09:36,532 --> 01:09:37,794
Home, Auto.

561
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:41,631
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

562
01:09:41,737 --> 01:09:43,034
That's all I've ever done.

563
01:09:43,139 --> 01:09:46,438
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

564
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,874
On the <i>Axiom</i> you will survive.

565
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:53,677
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

566
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:14,292
I'm the captain of the <i>Axiom.</i>

567
01:10:14,403 --> 01:10:17,031
We are going home today.

568
01:10:22,711 --> 01:10:23,871
GO-4?

569
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:26,647
Hey! That's not...

570
01:10:26,749 --> 01:10:29,309
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

571
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:39,425
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

572
01:10:40,129 --> 01:10:41,118
No!

573
01:10:51,407 --> 01:10:52,431

- Over here. Throw it.

578
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:03,818

580
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:07,947

Halt.
