1
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,370
My friends on the mainland...

2
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:29,047
...think just because I live in Hawai'i...

3
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:30,326
...I live in paradise.

4
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:33,001
Like a permanent vacation.

5
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:35,905
We're all just out here
siping Mai Tais...

6
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,941
...shaking our hips, catching waves.

7
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,120
Are they insane?

8
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,945
Do they think we are
immune to life?

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,828
How can they possibly think
our families are less screwed up...

10
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:49,062
Our cancers less fatal...

11
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,873
Our heartache less painful.

12
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:55,787
Hell, I haven't been on
a surfboard in 15 years.

13
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:01,156
For the last 23 days...

14
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,720
...I've been living in a paradise of IVs...

15
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,382
...and urine bags and
endotracheal tubes.

16
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,589
Paradise.

17
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:11,558
Paradise can go fuck itself.

18
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,034
This is Elizabeth Thorson King.

19
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,354
My wife.

20
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:28,498
23 days ago she was launched from
a powerboat during a race and hit her head.

21
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:30,151
Almost drowned.

22
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:34,510
When I heard about the accident
and about the coma...

23
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,202
...I wasn't even in town.

24
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,539
I was on Maui on business.
We hadn't spoken in 3 days.

25
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,236
In a way, we hadn't
really spoken in months.

26
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:52,549
If you're doing this to get
my attention, Liz, It's working.

27
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,533
I'm ready now...

28
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,479
I am ready to talk,
I am ready to change...

29
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,780
I'm ready to be your
real husband and a real father.

30
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:07,064
Just wake up...
Please, Liz, just wake up.

31
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:13,643
Hi, Noe, what's up?

32
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,801
Matt, Scottie's teacher's on the phone.

33
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,161
She says it's urgent.

34
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,638
Okay, Put her on.

35
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,188
We don't think
these photographs are appropriate...

36
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,450
...for Scottie to be sharing
with her classmates.

37
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,797
Some of them
went home quite disturbed...

38
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:30,522
...and we've got some
angry calls from parents.

39
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:33,187
Yeah, she's kind of
been going to town...

40
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:35,613
...on this whole
picture-taking thing, I had no idea-

41
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,810
Mr. King.

42
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:38,725
We see this every day.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,600
Children acting out at school
when something's wrong at home.

44
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:46,533
And your family is
facing a devastating crisis.

45
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,729
Have you been engaging Scottie
in really talking about what's going on?

46
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,860
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

47
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:54,698
Encouraging her
to express her feelings?

48
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,782
- That's crucial.
- I understand.

49
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,480
What's the matter with you?

50
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:00,604
Showing those pictures of Mom
for your art project?

51
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,270
I'm a photographer, Dad,
a real photographer.

52
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,236
No, you're not.
You're overdoing it is what you're doing.

53
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:06,905
I saw it in a book.

54
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,760
Some famous photographer lady
took pictures of her mom in the hospital...

55
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:13,403
...While she was dying,
and they're considered art.

56
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,606
That's what I'm doing.

57
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:17,320
First of all, your mother's very sick,
but she's not dying.

58
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:20,577
And second of all, we don't share
personal stuff with strangers.

59
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:23,154
What's going on
with Mom is private.

60
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,495
- I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?
- No.

61
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,993
The last time I took care of Scottie
by myself was when she was one 30.

62
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:31,391
Now she's 10.

63
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:33,473
And I have no idea
what to do with her.

64
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,746
I want to eat now,
not in an hour.

65
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:38,773
And with Elizabeth in the hospital,
she's testing me.

66
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,845
I'm the backup parent.

67
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:42,615
The understudy.

68
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:46,192
This's Matt King, I'm returning your call.
How can I help you?

69
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:48,456
It's your daughter, Scottie.

70
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,065
She's been texting some
awful things to My daughter, Lani...

71
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,369
...and I'd like her to stop.

72
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:53,133
Huh.

73
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,855
Here's the latest one. "We all know
you grew pubes over the summer."

74
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,583
I mean, my daughter can't help that
she's developing a little early for her age.

75
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,274
Do you think that's nice?

76
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:04,962
Oh, That's not like her at all.

77
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:07,068
She's usually very sweet.

78
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:10,967
As you may know, her mother isn't well,
maybe this is how she's dealing with it.

79
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm very sorry about
your family situation, Mr. King...

80
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:16,903
...But my daughter comes home
from school in tears.

81
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,385
Yeah, no, I get it. I'm sorry.

82
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,272
Scottie's the one who should be sorry.

83
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,758
I want her to come over
and apologize...

84
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,052
...and I don't ever want her
to text my daughter again.

85
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:30,058
If she doesn't apologize,
I'll take it up with the dean.

86
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,478
You can't buy
your way out of this.

87
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,080
Can you give me an address?

88
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,484
Thank you for coming by.

89
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,061
Hi.

90
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:59,423
I forgot to mention
the time Scottie said...

91
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,613
...she didn't want to be
Lani's partner at the rock wall...

92
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:04,106
...because she didn't want to
fall into my daughter's butt crack.

93
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,788
That doesn't even make sense.

94
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,404
Scottie...

95
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,889
Do you have something
you want to say to Lani?

96
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,587
Sorry.

97
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:30,910
It's okay.

98
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,232
Great.
Well, nice meeting you both.

99
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,571
Lani, you should come over
to our house sometime.

100
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,501
For a swim or a hike or something.

101
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,331
I don't think she's sorry at all.

102
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:43,846
She's going to keep on
doing it. I can tell.

103
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,027
No, she won't.

104
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:48,503
Look... Scottie,
you're gonna stop, right?

105
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,640
And you're really really sorry, right?

106
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,124
- Oh, and Mr. King?
- Yes?

107
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:05,494
Good luck with the sale.

108
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,860
They say your decision
will have a major impact...

109
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,312
...on Hawai'i's real estate world.

110
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,811
Not to mention the whole
landscape of Kaua'i.

111
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,455
Hundreds of millions of dollars, yeah?

112
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,485
Yeah, it's a big decision.

113
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:20,389
My husband's family is from Kaua'i.

114
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:24,423
Hanapepe, born and bred.
They hope you don't sell.

115
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:25,836
You don't say.

116
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,263
All the traffic it's gonna make.

117
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:36,022
As if Liz's coma weren't enough already...

118
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,811
The whole goddamned state
is following my decision...

119
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:42,078
...on who's gonna buy
25,000 acres on Kaua'i...

120
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,811
...that my family has
owned since the 1860s.

121
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,915
A lot of my cousins are broke and
the sale will make us all very very rich.

122
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:54,677
My family meets in 6 days
to approve a buyer.

123
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:58,165
But ever since my father died,
I'm the sole trustee.

124
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,637
Which means I alone
hold all the cards.

125
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:09,919
My great-great-grandmother was
Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani,

126
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:12,829
One of the last direct descendants
of King Kamehameha.

127
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,192
She was originally
supposed to marry her cousin...

128
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,378
...but she fell in love with
Edward King, her haole banker...

129
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,919
...whose parents were missionaries.

130
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:23,623
Between his land deals
and her huge inheritance...

131
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:26,838
...generations of their
descendants, all of us...

132
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:31,856
...have watched the past unfurl millions
into our laps through leases and sales.

133
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,111
Now something called
the Rule Against Perpetuities...

134
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:38,989
...is forcing us to dissolve the trust.

135
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:43,094
We're selling our last huge parcel of
virgin Hawaiian land.

136
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:50,163
Unlike a lot of of my cousins,
I havn't blown my share of the trust money.

137
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,950
Just like my father before me...

138
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:55,092
I live only on the income
from my law practice.

139
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:58,424
I don't want my daughters
growing up spoiled and entitled.

140
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,722
Liz always accuses me of being stinginess,
but I agree with my father:

141
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:04,501
You give your children
enough money to do something...

142
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,871
...but not enough to do nothing.

143
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:08,940
Matt, your cousins are here.

144
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:16,409
Not only am I the sole trustee...

145
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,531
...but I specialize in real
estate transactional low.

146
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,598
So a few of the more involved cousins...

147
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,906
...have been meeting with me
regularly to analyze the bids.

148
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:23,951
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

149
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,030
Cousin Hal...

150
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,449
Cousin Milo...

151
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:27,843
Cousin Stan...

152
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,168
Cousin Six...

153
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,039
Cousin Wink...

154
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,562
Cousin Connie.

155
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:32,519
Okay.

156
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:35,506
And Cousin Dave, both of whom
oppose the sale entirely.

157
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,736
Good to see you.

158
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:38,650
Don't be fooled by appearances.

159
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:42,526
In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people
look like bums and stuntmen.

160
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:43,759
Alright, so, where are we?

161
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:45,473
The proposals are virtually the same.

162
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:48,712
Hotels, shopping centers,
condos and golf courses.

163
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,226
I have some major concerns...

164
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,974
A Chicago group is offering
half a billion dollars...

165
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,826
But we're leaning toward a lower bid
from a guy named Don Holitzer.

166
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,625
He's actually from Kaua'i...

167
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,415
...made a fortune in Silicon Valley.

168
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,997
Old cousin Hugh is pushing us
in that direction, and I say why not?

169
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:07,051
The money will come from
Hawaii and stay in Hawaii.

170
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:23,459
Elizabeth's gonna
make it out okay. I know it.

171
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:25,688
It's not her time yet.

172
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:33,457
She'll wake up, Scottie and Alexandra
will have their mother back...

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,464
...and we'll talk about our marriage.

174
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,759
I know I can make things right.

175
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:43,914
I'll sell the land and quit my practice
and buy her whatever she wants:

176
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:46,466
A big boat,
a house in France...

177
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:49,614
We'll take a trip around the world,
just the two of us.

178
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,494
We'll get close again...

179
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:52,814
...like the early days.

180
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:57,362
I wish I had better news, Matthew.

181
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:01,706
But Dr. Chun and Dr. Mueller
and I agree that her condition...

182
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,140
...is deteriorating.

183
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:09,417
She has no eye movements,
She has no pupillary responses...

184
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:13,241
She has no brainstem reflexes whatsoever.

185
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:16,646
The machines can keep her alive.

186
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,903
But the quality of her life
would be so poor...

187
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,313
Basically the way it is now.

188
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:29,254
She'll never be the way
she was, Matt. Never.

189
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,847
We know that now.

190
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,739
Look...

191
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,727
I can't tell you how sorry
I am to tell you this.

192
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,583
And you do have your daughters.

193
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,986
There's just nothing
more that we can do.

194
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,023
So if we do go ahead and
take her off the machines -

195
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,311
There is no if.

196
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,372
It's When. I have a legal
obligation, You know that.

197
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,568
How long will she last?

198
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,135
That's hard to say.

199
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,055
Could be a few days,
Could be a couple of weeks.

200
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,589
For planning purposes, I think you should
work off the shortest possible scenario.

201
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:25,105
I know I've got to get the ball rolling
on the organ donations right away.

202
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:28,733
Matt...

203
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:32,512
Elizabeth has many friends...

204
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,354
She has a big life.

205
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,854
If you're gonna let everybody
know to say goodbye which is...

206
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:44,209
...the typical protocol for these
situations, you start now.

207
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:47,968
Then when the last day comes...

208
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:51,072
...they feel more ready.

209
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:56,125
As ready as they
can feel for something like this.

210
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,381
I'm so sorry, Matt.

211
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:46,628
- Hey!
- Hey!

212
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:47,544
There he is!

213
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,375
How's it going?

214
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,172
What's going on?

215
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,842
Oh, she's been looking a little pale
lately all cooped up in here and...

216
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:55,607
...I just know she'd be mortified if nobody
helped her out with some lipstick and blush.

217
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:56,911
I know she'll grill me.

218
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:59,853
And of course Kai's getting her
all caught up on all the latest gossip.

219
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,342
Well, I don't want to
start from scratch later.

220
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,149
Oh, and Matt,
on the way here we stopped by...

221
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,271
...and putted some meals
in your fridge, all ready to nuke.

222
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,785
- Thanks.
- Mmhmm.

223
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,022
So what's the latest anyway, Matt?
Any updates?

224
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,578
Just more of the same.
just keeping her kidneys...

225
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,500
...and other vital organs working,

226
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:20,244
And hoping for the best.

227
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:35,000
ocean outrigger club

228
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,315
The food at the club is so good.

229
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,716
Yeah, they do a good job here.

230
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,594
Why is it called a jellyfish?

231
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:21,596
It's not a fish,
it's not jelly.

232
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,384
I have no idea.

233
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:26,595
You ask good questions, Scottie.
You're getting too smart for me.

234
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,734
I'm gonna ask Mom
when she wakes up.

235
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:32,269
Do you think she's gonna
know everything she used to?

236
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:34,411
I don't know.

237
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,732
I'll be right back.

238
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:52,571
Hi, Matt.

239
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:53,429
Hi, Scottie.

240
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:54,278
Troy.

241
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,446
So, what's going on?

242
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,846
I mean, how's Elizabeth doing?

243
00:15:58,923 --> 00:15:59,990
The same.

244
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,067
Well, you know, I went and
visited her last week and...

245
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:05,829
I thought she looked pretty good.

246
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,159
Then why'd you ask?

247
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,289
I don't know, I guess I just
wanted to know what the latest is.

248
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:12,523
And I've been praying for her every day...

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,773
...you guys. Really hard. Seriously.

250
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:19,620
What I meant to say was, when
I was there, I talked to her and she...

251
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,255
...She moved her hand and...

252
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,988
Then I was like... I was encouraged.
I thought that was an encouraging sign.

253
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:26,929
That's enough.

254
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,484
I really think she heard me.

255
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,562
Look, Troy...

256
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:33,927
Go to your friends.
There's no hard feelings.

257
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,567
Let's just leave it alone.

258
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,967
I told you, Matt.

259
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,274
The water that day was so choppy.
I told you a hundred times.

260
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,226
What happened to her
could have happened to me.

261
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,243
I mean the ocean was brutal that day.
You can ask anybody.

262
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,364
You weren't supposed to be driving,
She was supposed to be driving.

263
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,548
She wanted me to drive.

264
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,038
She's the one who told me to
pass the other boat before the turn.

265
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,441
You know, it's just your
whole attitude toward me.

266
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,618
I feel terrible about it.

267
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,721
Plus I almost drowned
myself when the boat caps -

268
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:11,857
Hey.

269
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,713
Scottie!

270
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,736
Hey! Scottie! Scottie!

271
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:18,224
Hey!

272
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:19,779
Listen.

273
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,910
Don't pay any attention to that guy.

274
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,197
That guy's a dope.

275
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:24,578
- I hate him.
- Yeah.

276
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:25,790
I know.

277
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,200
Hey. Let's do something crazy.

278
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,739
Alright?
let's drive over the airport...

279
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:34,093
We'll hop over to the Big Island
and we'll surprise your sister.

280
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:34,976
What do you say?

281
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,861
Right now?

282
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:38,956
Yes, it'll be fun.
She's not expecting us.

283
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,085
And... we can bring her home.

284
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,482
I think she should be
here with us, don't you?

285
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,022
Don't you miss her?
I miss her.

286
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:47,495
Yeah, I mean I'm out of school.
She should be too!

287
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,727
Okay. Let's go. Com on.

288
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,331
Hey, Troy.

289
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:12,859
Somehow it feels natural to find a
daughter of mine on a different island.

290
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,294
A family seems
exactly like an archipelago.

291
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,852
All part of the same whole,
but still separate and alone.

292
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,223
And always drifting slowly apart.

293
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,138
That's the wrong door.

294
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:07,121
Go back to sleep, Rylan.

295
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,184
It's ok.

296
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:20,613
Wake up to your roommate, please.

297
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:23,515
Um... Alex isn't here.

298
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:24,769
Where is she?

299
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,745
I think she's somewhere outside.

300
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,211
Where outside?

301
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:42,751
Hey, girls! What you guys
think you're doing out here?

302
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:44,096
Run!

303
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:47,124
- Fuck!
- Hi, Alex!

304
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,445
It's me, Scottie!

305
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:51,817
I pay $35,000 a year for this
kind of crap not to happen.

306
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:52,611
Alex!

307
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,365
Dad?

308
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:59,187
- My fucking dad is here!
- You need to watch your language.

309
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,734
This is unacceptable behavior.

310
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,525
What's up, Dad?

311
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,683
What's happening?

312
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,942
You need to come home
and see your Mom.

313
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,777
Fuck Mom!

314
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:19,065
Really? What did I just say
about the language?

315
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,650
You could get expelled for all of this.

316
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,979
What is it that makes the women
in my life wanna destroy themselves?

317
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:30,308
Elizabeth with her
motorcycles and speedboats...

318
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:31,478
...and drinking.

319
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:35,636
Alexandra with her
drugs and older guys.

320
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,382
And Scottie...

321
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,148
...with Elizabeth gone...

322
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:42,190
What kind of a chance
will she have with just me?

323
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,278
Go to bed.

324
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:19,501
All right.

325
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,140
Here we go.

326
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:25,879
I don't like eggs.

327
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,981
Why didn't you tell me
before I made them?

328
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,620
I thought they were for you.

329
00:21:35,454 --> 00:21:36,346
Good morning.

330
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:46,602
How're you feeling?

331
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,245
Hungover?

332
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:51,269
Why am I not surprised?

333
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,415
I thought you were supposed to be
getting your act together.

334
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:56,017
I have gotten my act together.

335
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,010
I was just drinking.

336
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,504
I've been doing really well, actually.
Nobody ever seems to notice that.

337
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:03,640
My grades are better...

338
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,361
How I was in that stupid play
that you guys didn't even bother to see.

339
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:07,891
Do you even
remember the name of it?

340
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,653
That's what I thought.

341
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,970
So what? Wht if I got drunk on the
one night you happened to stop by?

342
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:17,245
So fucking what?

343
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,598
Hey, hey. Watch your
language around Scottie.

344
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:20,483
I don't care.

345
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,296
Anyway.

346
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:25,257
Listen.

347
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:27,400
it's nice to see you.

348
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:28,668
Welcome home.

349
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,695
Want some eggs?

350
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,694
I can't believe that.

351
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:49,452
What?

352
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:52,670
Oh, my God!

353
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,251
Aha...

354
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:55,167
Alex?

355
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:55,974
What did she say?

356
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:00,338
Can I talk to you for a minute?

357
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,128
The pool's really dirty.

358
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:05,101
Aha...

359
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:07,354
Wait... what?

360
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:08,615
- Hey.
- No.

361
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:09,839
I really need to talk to you.

362
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:11,433
She didn't say anything to me.

363
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:16,159
Aha...

364
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,984
Oh my God, I can't believe...

365
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,825
Hey, yeah... I gotta go.

366
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:23,171
Okay, I'll see you later.

367
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:29,973
What day does
the pool guy come?

368
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:31,584
He comes...

369
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:34,761
You know, I don't know when he comes.

370
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:35,869
Awesome.

371
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:37,621
Sid's coming over.

372
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:38,921
Who's Sid?

373
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:42,318
A really good friend from Punahou.
We were in school together for years.

374
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:43,934
Oh. Okay.

375
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,156
He wants to be there for me
with all this shit happening.

376
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,124
Do I know his parents?

377
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:51,101
No.

378
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:54,395
He might stay over too.
Is that cool?

379
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,161
Guys, over here.

380
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:59,043
What the fuck? Get out of my
underwear, you freak.

381
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:00,811
Okay, no, no, no, no!

382
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,067
Back inside put on the swimsuit.

383
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:04,009
Why?

384
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:05,135
Now.

385
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:10,574
A real good job you're doing.

386
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,999
That's part of why
I brought you here.

387
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,450
You have to help me with her.
I don't know what to do with her.

388
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:17,543
Maybe if you spent
more time with her...

389
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:20,201
...she wouldn't act like
such a complete spaz.

390
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:23,891
Get her out of town -
Go camp on Kaua'i.

391
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:26,644
That's what mom used to do with me
whenever I was losing it.

392
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,404
Hey.

393
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:29,238
Listen.

394
00:24:29,374 --> 00:24:31,252
No, listen, listen to me.

395
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:33,662
Your mother is not well.

396
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:35,030
Well, obviously.

397
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:36,204
No.

398
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,261
They just told me
she isn't gonna wake up.

399
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,127
We know for sure now.

400
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,445
The doctors are gonna
stop caring for her.

401
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:53,424
Your mother wanted it this way.
She has this...

402
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,815
She has this will, see...

403
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,171
...that says that
we have to do it this way.

404
00:24:58,314 --> 00:24:59,857
We both do.

405
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:04,246
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

406
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,301
That's why I got you.

407
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:13,986
Honey, we're letting her go.

408
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,721
Why'd you have to tell me
in the goddamned pool?

409
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:47,754
Alex...

410
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:48,887
Alex!

411
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:50,375
What?

412
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:51,954
What do you want?

413
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,512
I just found out yesterday.

414
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:20,699
We have to go through
this thing together...

415
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,841
...you and Scottie and me.

416
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:27,161
And I have to go around
and tell people what's happening.

417
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,228
Family and a few close friends.

418
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,478
Sometimes I'll really
need you to come with me.

419
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,418
Sometimes I need you to watch Scottie.

420
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:42,764
You want me to go around with you and
tell people that Mom's gonna die?

421
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,440
What's the point of that?

422
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:49,807
Breaking the news, watching them cry,
dealing with their emotions.

423
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,703
How depressing is that
gonna be? Just call them.

424
00:26:53,072 --> 00:26:55,092
Alex, nobody
wants to do any of this.

425
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:59,194
But we have to tell your Grandpa
and Tutu, and a few friends.

426
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:02,508
They have the right to know,
They have the right to say goodbye.

427
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,448
I don't wanna talk
about Mom with anyone.

428
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:09,673
Look, whatever you two fought about
over Christmas, you have to drop it.

429
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:10,846
Grow up.

430
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:13,089
You love your mother.
Your mother loves you.

431
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,336
I can't drop it.

432
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:15,623
You have to.

433
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:18,711
You really don't have a clue, do you?

434
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:25,227
Dad...

435
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,861
Dad, mom was cheating on you.

436
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,968
That's what we fought about.

437
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,143
When I was over at Christmas,
I caught her with the guy.

438
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,170
It made me sick
to see her near you.

439
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,399
I went back to school
thinking that that was it...

440
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,962
...that I was just done with her.

441
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:49,710
I was gonna call and
tell you everything, and...

442
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,435
...and then the accident
happened, and...

443
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,785
...I was waiting until
she woke up, I guess.

444
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:03,311
You didn't even suspect. Right?

445
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:06,698
Right?

446
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,834
You disgusted me too.
You're always so busy.

447
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:17,566
Caught her with a guy?
What does that mean?

448
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:22,024
I was on my way to swim in
the Black Point pool with Brandy...

449
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:25,983
...and suddenly I see Mom and
some douchebag walking into a house.

450
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,097
His house, I guess.

451
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,254
Just some guy?
It could be anybody.

452
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,235
Yeah, he had his hand on her ass.

453
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,041
It was gross.

454
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:45,582
Then what?

455
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:48,009
Then nothing.
Then they went into the house.

456
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:52,365
A few days later I told her
I knew what she was doing.

457
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:54,201
And?

458
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,242
And first she acted like she
had no idea what I was talking about.

459
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,343
Like I'm fucking blind.

460
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:06,792
Then she got like super-mad
and yelled and denied it.

461
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,977
That is when I decided I didn't want
anything more to do with her.

462
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:16,373
Who is he?

463
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:18,998
I don't know. Some guy.

464
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:21,375
What did he look like?

465
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,543
Dark hair.

466
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,883
Watch your sister.

467
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:27,636
Hello?

468
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,110
Kai?

469
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:30,870
Mark?

470
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:33,833
It's me, Matt!

471
00:30:34,597 --> 00:30:35,481
Hey!

472
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:39,858
Hello!

473
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:41,581
Wait... Hello?

474
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:42,636
It's me, it's Matt!

475
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:45,996
Oh, hey, Matt.

476
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:47,357
It's a bad time?

477
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:48,684
No, no, we were just fighting.

478
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,782
Come on in. You want some coffee?
You want something to drink?

479
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:52,203
No, thanks.

480
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,616
- Fighting about something stupid.
- It is not stupid.

481
00:30:56,846 --> 00:31:00,572
He wants us to throw parties and
have people over, which we do, of course...

482
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:02,270
...but who winds up doing
all the work? Me.

483
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:04,160
You don't have to do anything.

484
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,980
- That's the whole point!
- Yes, I do.

485
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:07,542
It's doesn't have to be work.
You don't have to...

486
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:09,262
...clean and buy a new outfit.

487
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:10,930
- Oh, I'm supposed to leave...
- ...and think of the...

488
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,221
...goddamn theme cocktail
for every party.

489
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:15,700
We can just invite people over
to hang out and drink whatever we have.

490
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:17,666
Let's talk about it later.

491
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,895
Oh, shit, Matt, is everything okay?

492
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:21,597
Is there any news?

493
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:24,015
In fact there is.
I'll tell you about it in a moment.

494
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:24,930
Who is he?

495
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,527
Does she love him?

496
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:34,001
Who is he?

497
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,691
Matt...

498
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,890
I'm sorry to put you in that position.

499
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:40,251
But I'm not really the one
who put you there, am I?

500
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:44,120
I'd like to know who the guy is
that my wife was... seeing.

501
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:46,107
Matt, you're angry.

502
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,895
You have very keen
powers of observation.

503
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:49,106
Wow. Okay, You know what I think?

504
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,572
We should just talk about this later.
I think maybe you need to cool it.

505
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,372
Is it Troy?
That fucking Neanderthal?

506
00:31:58,568 --> 00:31:59,615
You don't know him.

507
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,917
Mark, don't you even.
Shame on you.

508
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,318
You're supposed to be her friend.

509
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,919
Well, guess what?
I'm Matt's friend too.

510
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:08,864
Okay? And this is a unique
and dramatic situation...

511
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:10,389
...and I'd wanna know.

512
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,118
Yeah, But don't betray her
when she can't even defend herself.

513
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:17,438
Matt...

514
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:20,120
Look, you might not be able
to hear this right now...

515
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,828
...but it's not her fault.

516
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:28,802
Your marriage was not... just...
She was lonely.

517
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:31,306
So you're going to talk to me
in clichés about women?

518
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:33,325
Nothing is ever a woman's fault.

519
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,364
Was it still going on
when she had the accident?

520
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,349
But I stayed out of it.

521
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,589
Anytime Kai would bring it up, I walked away.

522
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,137
And you What?

523
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:50,463
You probably eggeed her on.
Add some drama to you'r life without any actual risk.

524
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,843
Whom do you think you are protecting Kai?
She doesn't need you'r protection...

525
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:57,157
it's over. she's gonna die.

526
00:32:57,158 --> 00:33:00,122
- Don't say that.
- It's true, I was gonna tell you yesterday.

527
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:03,657
She is never gonna wake up.
You hear me? Do you understand what I'm saying?

528
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:04,774
She is gone!

529
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,352
We are pulling the plug.

530
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:09,538
You were putting lipstick on a corpse!

531
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:15,990
Come on, Matt.

532
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:18,515
That's a little intense.

533
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:43,953
Does she love him?

534
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:48,125
How can you ask about him when shes
going to die? who cares?

535
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,579
Yes, she loves him...

536
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,323
...loved him, whatever. She was crazy about him.
She was going to...

537
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:57,204
...She was going to ask you for a divorce.

538
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,861
You still haven't told me who he is.

539
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:16,122
I guess it doesnt matter.

540
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,358
Matt?

541
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,651
Matt!

542
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,655
Brian Speer.

543
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,750
His name is Brian Speer.

544
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:37,066
Two es.

545
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,236
Hi, Daddy.

546
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,549
Hello, Sid.

547
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:37,754
What's up bro?

548
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:40,261
Dont ever do that to me again.

549
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:42,745
Get ready, Were going to see your
Grandparents...

550
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:44,682
Auntie Esther will come over to watch
you.

551
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:46,436
Dad, Sid's coming with us, okay?

552
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:50,823
Yeah, listen Sid, whats going on this weekend, is
realy family matter. You understand.

553
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:55,744
Sids not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents.
He's gonna be bored stiff.

554
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:58,058
Dad, I told you that he was going to be with me.

555
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:03,456
Ill be a lot more civil with him
around.

556
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:06,031
What can I say?

557
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:16,671
This is like reading Korean.

558
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:20,709
Scott, if you want, I can walk you through it.

559
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,541
Jibber-jabber.

560
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,045
Its an advanced directive...

561
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:29,873
It's basically her instructions on what
procedures she wants or...

562
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:32,482
I know goddamn well what it says.

563
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:35,871
she doesnt want us sit around
watching her spoiling like milk.

564
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:41,749
if there is nothing of doctors can do,
shed just get on with it.

565
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,404
Elizabeth had the good sense
to write this thing here.

566
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,632
She always was a thoughtful
girl.

567
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:50,037
A Strong girl.

568
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:52,264
A hell of a lot stronger than her brother.

569
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:54,634
Barry whines his way through life.

570
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:56,849
Might even be a homosexual, for all I know.

571
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,042
Scott, I do not think.

572
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:00,099
And shes stronger than you, Matt.

573
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,837
She lived more in a year
than you did in a decade,

574
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,981
sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash.

575
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:08,654
All that money you refuse to use...

576
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:10,262
what the hell good is it?

577
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:14,961
And now you and your family
get ready cashing in your chips, what the hell for?

578
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:17,846
Maybe if youd let my baby have
her own boat and bought her...

579
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:19,603
some safe equipment or...

580
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:23,098
let her go on those shopping sprees women like.

581
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,237
maybe she wouldnt have gone in
for those shrill sports.

582
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:30,648
Maybe if youd provided more thrills at home.

583
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,688
And you, Alexandra...

584
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:35,108
Putting your poor mother through hell...

585
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:38,927
when all she was trying to do was instill
some sense and drive in you.

586
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:40,471
Shame on you.

587
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:42,014
Shame on you!

588
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:45,669
You should try to be more like her.

589
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,718
Shes a good girl.
Shes a...

590
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,632
Good girl.

591
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,389
Hi, Alice

592
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,118
Its me, Matt.

593
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,003
It's good to see you.

594
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:46,001
Good to see you too.

595
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:47,123
Hi, Tutu.

596
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,066
Thats Alexandra.

597
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:51,040
Shes your grand daughter.

598
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,756
And this is your son-in-law Matt.

599
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:55,221
This is your family.

600
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:58,845
Well, except this kid.
I dont know who the hell he is.

601
00:38:58,846 --> 00:38:59,738
Who are you?

602
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:00,875
What are you doing here?

603
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:01,963
He's my friend.

604
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,081
Good afternoon.

605
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:10,221
Alice...

606
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:14,840
Alice, were going to go to Queens
Hospital this afternoon and see Elizabeth.

607
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:15,945
We are?

608
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:16,889
Yes.

609
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,177
She needs us,

610
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:22,036
just like when she was a little girl.
We need to see her in the hospital.

611
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:26,110
So think about what she might want in her room.

612
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:29,318
...We'll take it to her and put it next to
her bed.

613
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:32,237
Queen Elizabeth?

614
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:35,053
That's wonderful!

615
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:39,153
I have to put on a nice dress.

616
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:41,861
Is she serious?

617
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:43,817
Shut up, kid.

618
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:47,599
I have never met Queen before.

619
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:51,838
Im sorry, man.

620
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,854
I was just laughing.
Its funny I mean.

621
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:57,093
I think she knows shes being funny.

622
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:02,721
Im going to hit you.

623
00:40:02,722 --> 00:40:04,455
That was unreal.

624
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:05,738
I mean...

625
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:10,878
how often do old people just haul off
and fucking cold-cock you in like that?

626
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:13,346
Hes hit me a couple times over the years.

627
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:15,564
And watch your tongue.

628
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:17,593
can I see it?

629
00:40:17,594 --> 00:40:20,928
Holly shit!

630
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:23,471
- Ow!
- could you two just cool it...

631
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:26,633
when you around me?
stop... touching each other.

632
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:28,916
Whoa man!

633
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:33,245
Maybe thats why your wife cheated on
you, if you are so against touching.

634
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:40,146
You little fuck. Do you get hit a lot?

635
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,070
I do not know.

636
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,221
Ive had my share.

637
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,497
Your friend is completely retarded.
You know that?

638
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:50,677
Hey man, my little brothers retarded.

639
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:55,871
Dont use that word in a derogatory fashion.

640
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,296
Oh.

641
00:40:58,297 --> 00:41:03,238
- Psych! I dont have a retarded brother!
- Sid, You suck.

642
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:07,855
Speaking of retarded...

643
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:11,794
...do you ever wish that retarded
people or old people could just hurry up?

644
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:13,417
like sometimes...

645
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:18,011
I'm waiting for them to cross the
street, and Im like, come on already!

646
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:20,567
But then I feel bad.

647
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,517
Dad?

648
00:41:31,518 --> 00:41:33,257
What?

649
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:38,886
Dont forget that I know where he lives.

650
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:44,455
Get in the front seat

651
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:49,415
Do you know anything about him? Like
what he does or if hes married or anything else?

652
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:52,758
just his name. Brian Speer.

653
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:54,894
Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?

654
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:56,185
I just didnt.

655
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:57,348
Why not?

656
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,498
I didnt want to get into it.

657
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:01,898
Well google him later.

658
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:05,988
Okay...

659
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,734
That's it, That's it, That's on
stop right there.

660
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,177
- right there?
- yeah, yeah.

661
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,834
There?

662
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,183
He lives there?

663
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:23,640
Well, I cant say for sure he lives
there. Thats just where I saw them.

664
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,546
Should I go ring the bell?

665
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:31,304
No, this is stupid... it's just
stalking, or something that, okay, it's...

666
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:34,730
We came, we saw, that's enough enough.
Let's go.

667
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,666
Its not like were stalking him
exactly.

668
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,734
What would you do if you saw him, anyway?

669
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:56,277
Talk to him or punch him or
what?

670
00:42:56,278 --> 00:42:58,677
I guess I just want to see him.

671
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,077
Dad, dad. Stop,
stop, stop, stop!

672
00:43:22,078 --> 00:43:22,695
What?

673
00:43:22,696 --> 00:43:24,936
Go back, go back!

674
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:25,608
What?

675
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,760
Just go back.

676
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,801
- Look, look!
- What?

677
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:39,523
Look! There he is!

Ill be right out.

693
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,974
You were going to ask me for a divorce?
So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer?

694
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:45,211
Are you kidding me?

695
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:47,297
Who are you?

696
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:51,536
the only thing I know for sure is that youre a
goddamned liar.

697
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:57,364
So what do you have to say for yourself?

698
00:45:57,365 --> 00:45:59,406
Go ahead, make a little joke and...

699
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:03,125
...tell me that Ive got it all wrong.

700
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:05,634
Tell me again Im too out of touch with
my feelings

701
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:07,630
and I need to go to therapy.

702
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:13,092
Isnt the idea of marriage to make your
partners way in life a little easier?

703
00:46:13,093 --> 00:46:15,663
For me it was always harder...

704
00:46:15,664 --> 00:46:19,609
with you and youre still making it harder.

705
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,140
Lying there on a ventilator and
fucking up my life.

706
00:46:23,141 --> 00:46:27,704
You're relentless.

707
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:30,926
You know what? I was going to ask you
for a divorce some day.

708
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,563
Daddys little girl.

709
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,055
Im bringing your daughters in now.

710
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,019
Alex is home from school

711
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,830
Try to be nice, okay?

712
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:10,590
Okay?

713
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,507
Hi, Mom! Look whos here.

714
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:31,428
Say something Alex. Tell her how
you were drunk the other night.

715
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,482
Tell her maybe youre an alcoholic.

716
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:37,338
Girls, be serious.

717
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:40,342
Hi, Mom.

718
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:44,082
Sorry for being bad.

719
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:48,844
sorry for wasting your money on expensive private schools.

720
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:52,437
Money you could have used on facials
and massages and...

721
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:53,620
...sports equipment.

722
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,325
- Sorry for everything.
- Okay.

723
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:59,313
Sorry we werent good enough for you...
especially Dad.

724
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:00,911
Stop it. Thats out of line.

725
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,334
Or what? You going to ground me?

726
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:05,490
Or ship me off to another boarding school?
You going to give me a time out?

727
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:08,119
Goddammit!

728
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,911
You got served!

729
00:48:09,912 --> 00:48:11,038
Scottie, out in the hall.

730
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,607
- Shes the one out of line.
- Go find Sid.

731
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:15,952
- Hes smoking. I shouldnt be around
second-hand smoke.

732
00:48:15,953 --> 00:48:18,120
Go! Now! Now! Now!

733
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:21,542
Did you just spank me?

734
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:24,101
You have no right to talk to your
mother that way. Shes going to die in a few days.

735
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:27,161
- What if those were your last words?
- I have every right to speak her that way.

736
00:48:27,162 --> 00:48:29,699
Im mad at her. How can you be so
forgiving?

737
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,802
Ill be angry later. Right now lets just think about the good parts.
and dont say that stuff in front of your sister.

738
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:40,768
Dont spoil her for Scottie.

739
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:42,718
Say something different.

740
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:55,068
Look, Mom, I know we fought a lot...

741
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:58,424
I just I always wanted to be like you.

742
00:48:58,425 --> 00:49:02,844
I am like you. Im exactly like you.

743
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:06,979
You are like her.

744
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,587
mostly in good ways.

745
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:13,234
Maybe some bad ways.
Remains to be seen.

746
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:18,254
Yeah.

747
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:27,317
Dad, this is Reina.

748
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,198
Reina, thiss my sister and Sid, and
thats my mom on the bed.

749
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,346
Hi every body.

750
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,506
Hello.

751
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:35,283
Hi.

752
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:43,204
So this is your mother?

753
00:49:43,205 --> 00:49:45,383
I guess its true.

754
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:47,326
Should I shake her hand?

755
00:49:47,327 --> 00:49:48,826
If you want.

756
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:50,296
No, thanks.

757
00:49:50,297 --> 00:49:54,341
So, Reina, I understand your grandmothers
not feeling well.

758
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:58,502
Yeah. Its pretty bad. She got her stomach
operated on

759
00:49:58,503 --> 00:50:01,005
and then got some stupid
infection or something.

760
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,517
Its pretty gross.

761
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:06,255
Well, Reina, thank you for stopping by...

762
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:09,226
...Scottie, let me give you some money, and
you two can go get ice cream...

763
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:11,947
Too many carbs.

764
00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:13,954
Too many carbs?

765
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:18,111
Well, you could go to the cafeteria
and get some lettuce.

766
00:50:18,112 --> 00:50:22,739
Thats okay. Im done.
you arent a liar after all.

767
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,970
Don't you want to hang out?

768
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:28,263
No, I should go. Ill see you at the
club. Hope your mom gets better.

769
00:50:28,264 --> 00:50:32,774
Bye everybody.

770
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:36,221
Scottie, whatd she mean by
You arent a liar after all?

771
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:37,975
What did she think you were lying about?

772
00:50:37,976 --> 00:50:40,263
she didnt believe Mom was sleeping.

773
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:42,945
So you had to prove to that twat that
Moms in a coma?

774
00:50:42,946 --> 00:50:46,358
What the fuck is in
your skull, a bunch of stupid pills?

775
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:48,399
shut up, you motherless whore!

776
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,459
Whoa, whoa, easy there, half-pipe.

777
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,511
Whered you learn how to talk like that?

778
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,395
Incoming Call
GOLD Coast Real Estate

779
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:13,912

No, I'm his assistant Sharon.
How may I help you?

782
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,960
Who is it?

783
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:24,472
Aha.

784
00:51:24,473 --> 00:51:28,238
Oh, All right, all right. So one or the other.

785
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,246
Okay, I'll tell him. Mahalo!

786
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:34,170
That was Bonnie Tanaka, a realtor.

787
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:37,646
She says that Mr. Speer is going to be
on Kauai for the next week but...

788
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:39,537
...shed be happy to show you the house or...

789
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:42,403
...you can stop by the open house on Sunday.

790
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:15,826
Hi Mr. King.

791
00:52:15,827 --> 00:52:16,853
Hello, Buzz.

792
00:52:16,854 --> 00:52:19,988
Sorry about Mrs. King. hope she gets better real soon.

793
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:22,320
Thanks.

794
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:25,544
It really blows.

795
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:29,517
I know.

796
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:33,518
Youve all ask questions about of Elizabeth.
and Ive given vague answers.</ i>

797
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,702
But I ask you all here today
to tell you that...

798
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:41,946
...her coma is permanent.

799
00:52:41,947 --> 00:52:45,225
Shes not going to make it.

800
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:47,422
So, this week...

801
00:52:47,423 --> 00:52:50,055
...Tomorrow, infact...

802
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:55,034
as for her her wishes, were going to unhook
her from life-support.

803
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:00,510
You all know Elizabeth...

804
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,004
...she is doing things on her own.

805
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:09,481
I wanted to tell you all in person...

806
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:15,990
...Because Youre all our dear friends
our best friends.

807
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:22,006
The girls and I are so much appreciate
severything youve done for us in the last few weeks...

808
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:26,154
bringing food, calling...

809
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:27,552
Can we go see her?

810
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:32,082
Yes, for Gods sake, yes. Thats the
whole point.

811
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,461
Go see her as soon as possible.
Thats what I wanted to tell you.

812
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,002
All of you.

813
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:40,971
It should be now, not after.

814
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:44,731
Everyone who loves her deserves a
chance to say goodbye.</ i>

815
00:54:15,176 --> 00:54:17,351
Youve lost your mind.

816
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:20,806
You mean him? Tell him to come say goodbye?

817
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:24,256
Ill only be gone a day or so. Ill leave in the
morning, and be back tomorrow night.

818
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:26,395
If it takes anothe rday,

819
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:29,806
fine... I'll give it two days
tops. If I dont find him, at least I tried.

820
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:30,634
Just Drop it, Dad.

821
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:35,633
Youve got way bigger
fish to fry than confronting fucking Brian Speer.

822
00:54:35,634 --> 00:54:38,005
Are you recording this?

823
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:39,816
Im summarizine a deposition.

824
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:42,405
How can you work in a time like this?

825
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:44,086
How can you go to a movie?

826
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:45,850
To get Scottie out of the house.

827
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:49,941
And youre going to tell him to come back
and see Mom.

828
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:55,778
I think... I just think she would want
him to know.

829
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,125
Just call his office and say it's an
emergency.

830
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:03,324
On the phone he can escape.

831
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:11,051
In person he got nowhere to go.
I want to see his face.

832
00:55:11,052 --> 00:55:13,543
Then I want to go too.

833
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,423
No, you are gonna stay here with Scottie.

834
00:55:15,424 --> 00:55:18,108
Fuck that. Lets all get out of town.

835
00:55:41,951 --> 00:55:45,776
Yo, Matt King!

836
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:47,698
- Hey, Ralph!
- Hey!

837
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:49,823
Yeah, how is it?

838
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:52,212
- Glad to see you.
- Kids, this is cousin Ralph

839
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:53,344
- Oh, yeah, Hi!
- Good to see you!

840
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:54,170
Glad to see you.

841
00:55:54,171 --> 00:55:55,284
Well, what you guys doing here?

842
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,858
Just came over for a day or two.

843
00:55:56,859 --> 00:55:58,050
Yeah, I just got back from Kahului. A
little business over there.

844
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,528
- Yes?
- Business is over there.

845
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:00,470
- Ahan.
- yeah.

846
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:01,980
So you here to talk to some
of the cousins?

847
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:03,625
Make sure everybodys
happy with your choice?

848
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,139
Pay your respects to Cousin Hugh?

849
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,920
No, no, nothing like that. Just
a little holoholo. Get the kids out of town.

850
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:09,576
But it is Holitzer, right?

851
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,021
We all know its Holitzer.

852
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:14,428
Cousin Hugh wants him, they go way back.
I got my misgivings, somehow.

853
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:17,859
Theres an argument to be made for
maxing it out. We only do this once in a lifetime.

854
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,451
yeah, no, I want to work with
you guys, Ralph, I really do.

855
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:23,932
Whatever the majority decides after
the Poll, Ill go along with it.

856
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:25,800
Lets just get it over with.

857
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:26,918
- All right.
- okay.

858
00:56:26,919 --> 00:56:28,794
Hows Elizabeth doing? She going to be
okay?

859
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:30,230
The same.

860
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:32,617
Well, shes a tough gal. Shell be
okay, yeah?

861
00:56:32,618 --> 00:56:33,389
Yeah.

862
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,097
Say, where you guys going, Hanalei?

863
00:56:35,098 --> 00:56:36,384
Princeville.

864
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:37,891
Come on. Ill give you a ride.

865
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:38,869
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

866
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:40,534
Come on, kids.

867
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:43,077
cousin Ralph give us a ride.

868
00:56:59,895 --> 00:57:02,395
- Hey, Ralph!
- yeah.

869
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:04,916
Turn off over here. Lets go see the
land.

870
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:06,967
Take a last look, huh?

871
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:08,057
You got time?

872
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:10,347
I got nothing but time.

873
00:57:31,274 --> 00:57:33,717
I think this is where a golf course is
going to be.

874
00:57:33,718 --> 00:57:36,030
They want the golf course to rival
Pebble Beach.

875
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:38,545
you know, bring in the big boys.

876
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
subtitle by
"amir_t6262" & "Hossein Gh" & "SUNNY_II"

877
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:08,160
Scotty, come on sweetie.

878
00:58:25,879 --> 00:58:28,106
Watch out, Scotty, watch out.

879
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:40,251
are you shitting me?

880
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:42,233
You guys own all this land?

881
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:45,562
Not personally. It belongs to a trust.

882
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,551
But yeah, its ours for a few more days.

883
00:58:47,552 --> 00:58:49,889
Big resort there on that point.

884
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,319
Commercial area over there...

885
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,002
houses all through there.

886
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:56,295
ther's part of me agrees with the
cousins who dont want to sell.

887
00:58:56,296 --> 00:58:58,392
Theyre going to make a pretty big
stink at the meeting.

888
00:58:58,393 --> 00:58:59,800
But we have to.

889
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:04,099
The trust dissolves in seven years, and if
we don't selld, it's just gonna be a train rack.

890
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,259
it is a shame, yeah?

891
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,507
On the other hand...

892
00:59:07,508 --> 00:59:09,907
...it's just sitting there.
No one's using it.

893
00:59:09,908 --> 00:59:13,496
At least this way the whole world
will be able to enjoy it.

894
00:59:13,497 --> 00:59:15,631
Take a good look, girls.

895
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:19,658
This is part of your great-great-great
grandmothers inheritance...

896
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:23,656
...going all way back to Kamehameha I.

897
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:26,732
Down there is where Mom and I would camp.

898
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,267
We all did, all our lives.

899
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:34,485
lots of memories.

900
00:59:34,486 --> 00:59:38,610
Everything has it's time.

901
00:59:38,611 --> 00:59:39,629
What about me?

902
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,665
I want to camp.

903
01:00:31,857 --> 01:00:35,703
By the way. Im supposed to meet a friend of
mine, I think he is staying here.

904
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:37,464
And his name is Brian Speer.

905
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:42,219
S- P-E-E-R.

906
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:46,782
sorry Mr King, I'm not
showing anybody that name.

907
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:48,976
Okay, thanks.

908
01:00:58,441 --> 01:01:00,326
Hey, Scottie.

909
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:01,952
whats in your suit?

910
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,542
They are my beach boobs.

911
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:06,343
Take them out of there. Right now.

912
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,428
Jesus Alex, whyd you let her do that? You too, Sid.

913
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:10,342
I do not know. Take them out, stupid!

914
01:01:10,343 --> 01:01:14,158
Yeah, Scottie. Big boobs
look kind of fatty.

915
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:22,966
Any luck?

916
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:26,473
The hotels was a dead end, but I took
another shot with his office.

917
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,744
Hes definitely renting a house in Hanalei.

918
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:34,113
probably one of that cottages around the bay.

919
01:01:34,114 --> 01:01:36,449
I think we should
go for a walk.

920
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,677
Yeah, let's go.

921
01:01:38,678 --> 01:01:40,681
Scottie?

922
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,377
Can we swim with the sharks?

923
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:52,759
I read in the hotel magazine how they like put
you in the cage in the water...

924
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,924
...and they throw shark...

925
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:56,951
...feed in the water and sharks swim right
up to you.

926
01:01:56,952 --> 01:01:57,886
Can we do that?

927
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,104
Scottie, were not really here to do
stuff like that.

928
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,047
What are we gonna do then?

929
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:21,274
How would you and mom meet?</ i>

930
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:24,754
I was with a law school buddy from the
mainland,</ i>

931
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:27,605
...and I took him to the club.
We were just coming in from paddling,</ i>

932
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:32,991
and your mom was on her way out, and she looked at me and said,
Do you think its going to snow today?

933
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:35,606
Did it realy snow?

934
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:38,491
stayed dry.

935
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,827
I like her stories.
Like how she streaked in wedding.

936
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:44,647
Oh my God!

937
01:02:44,648 --> 01:02:49,593
There are so many.
As when...

938
01:02:49,594 --> 01:02:51,384
your mom
get chased by a shark...

939
01:02:51,385 --> 01:02:53,548
What?
When that was happened?

940
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:57,957
We were on Molokai with Mark and Kai,

941
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,458
and your mom was out surfing and saw a
shark right beneath her on a wave...

942
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:18,900
Lets watch one of these!

943
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:21,245
No, Were not watching porn.

944
01:03:21,246 --> 01:03:23,706
- Give me that.
- No.

945
01:03:23,707 --> 01:03:26,512
Reinas dad watches pornes.

946
01:03:26,513 --> 01:03:28,792
Reina calls them masturbation movies.

947
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:34,560
She plays them when her parents arent home
and one time invited boys over to see if they grew down there.

948
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,063
One did.

949
01:03:36,064 --> 01:03:38,149
Reina sounds awesome.

950
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,919
Were you there? Did you watch
one of those movies?

951
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,301
No.

952
01:03:42,302 --> 01:03:43,883
Hey! Scottie!

953
01:03:43,884 --> 01:03:47,301
Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag, and you
need to stay away from her.

954
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:50,963
and she is going to be a meth-head,
and shes going to get used by stupid guys.

955
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:53,684
She's a twat. Say it.

956
01:03:53,685 --> 01:03:54,825
Shes a twat.

957
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:56,841
Okay.

958
01:03:56,842 --> 01:03:58,973
- Shes a twat, twat, twat!
- Okay, okay. Stop it!

959
01:03:58,974 --> 01:04:00,137
twat, twat, twat, twat.

960
01:04:00,138 --> 01:04:03,306
...twat, twat, twat, twat...

961
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:05,841
I dont get it. I dont know what to
do...

962
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,736
...these things she does. What goes
on in her head?

963
01:04:08,737 --> 01:04:11,022
You werent like that.

964
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:12,083
Itll go away.

965
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:14,634
Im not so sure. I mean, look how you
kids talk in front of me...

966
01:04:14,635 --> 01:04:17,362
...It's like you dont respect authority.

967
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:55,216
Hey.

968
01:04:55,217 --> 01:04:56,063
Hi.

969
01:04:56,064 --> 01:04:59,532
Checking on me or something?

970
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:01,942
I havent been sleeping
very much lately.

971
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:04,817
Understandable.

972
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:22,750
Im worried about my daughters.

973
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:25,677
I think there's something wrong with them.

974
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:29,670
I used to do some messed-up shit
when I was a kid.

975
01:05:29,671 --> 01:05:31,882
I still do.

976
01:05:31,883 --> 01:05:36,781
It's going to
get worse after your wife dies.

977
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:39,993
What does Alex really think about this
stuff thats going on? What does she say?

978
01:05:39,994 --> 01:05:41,499
She doesn't.

979
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,075
What do you mean? I thought she
talks to you all the time.

980
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:47,205
We dont really talk about our like
issues.

981
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:50,954
We just, I dont know, we deal with our shit by talking about
other stuff and having a good time.

982
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:59,783
What would you do if you were me?

983
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:02,770
How would you handle my daughters?

984
01:06:03,383 --> 01:06:06,809
How would you handle... the situation of
this guy were trying to find?

985
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:08,289
I told you, man.

986
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:12,254
Would I put the nuts on a dresser
and will be hitting with the spiked bat.

987
01:06:13,413 --> 01:06:15,863
With the daughters, I dont know.

988
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:18,074
Exchange them for sons, I guess.

989
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:20,878
Then I might wind up with something
like you.

990
01:06:20,879 --> 01:06:22,541
Im not so bad.

991
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:23,576
Im smart.

992
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:27,229
Youre about a hundred miles away from
Smartville. No offense.

993
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,854
Youre mistaken, counselor.

994
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:33,938
Im smart.
I have good hygiene.

995
01:06:33,939 --> 01:06:35,874
Im an decent
guitarist,

996
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,848
a good cook. I cook food
all the time.

997
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:42,374
Im vice-president of
the Punahou chess club.

998
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:44,464
And I always
have weed.

999
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:47,632
Your mom must
be very proud.

1000
01:06:49,447 --> 01:06:50,564
Its possible.

1001
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,410
My moms sort of busy
right now.

1002
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,347
Yes. What does she do, your mom?

1003
01:06:55,657 --> 01:06:57,830
Shes a receptionist at a pet clinic.

1004
01:06:57,939 --> 01:07:01,978
But mostly shes been getting the house
together after my dad died.

1005
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:04,287
My dad died a few months ago

1006
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,935
November 24th.

1007
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:11,882
Drunk driver.

1008
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,940
Actually
both drivers were drunk. Yeah.

1009
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:17,716
Yes.

1010
01:07:32,653 --> 01:07:33,641
Good night, Sid.

1011
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:36,137
Good night, boss.

1012
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:43,125
Ill see you in the morning.

1013
01:10:36,976 --> 01:10:40,992
Stay in the zone, please! That means
you, Skylar. And you too, Colt.

1014
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,020
Watch your sister,
Ill be right back.

1015
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:07,753
Looks like you got yourself a handful
with those two.

1016
01:11:09,253 --> 01:11:10,230
Yes.

1017
01:11:11,206 --> 01:11:12,000
Yes.

1018
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:13,228
Must keep you pretty busy.

1019
01:11:13,942 --> 01:11:17,630
Theyre pretty non-stop, but theyre at
a really fun age.

1020
01:11:17,631 --> 01:11:19,006
How old are they?

1021
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:20,007
Eight and ten.

1022
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,345
I have two girls.

1023
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:24,067
Ten and seventeen.

1024
01:11:24,307 --> 01:11:26,872
That whole non-stop thing. That never
changes.

1025
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:29,920
You guys live here?

1026
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,963
- Oahu.
- Oh, so do we.

1027
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:38,456
Yeah, Im just getting my girls out of
town for a couple days.

1028
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:41,128
their mother is in the hospital, so I
thought Id give them a little break.

1029
01:11:41,308 --> 01:11:42,286
Oh, no.

1030
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:46,224
Whats wrong? If you dont mind my
asking.

1031
01:11:46,892 --> 01:11:49,376
Just a little boating accident. Hit
her head a little too hard.

1032
01:11:53,223 --> 01:11:54,038
A sailboat?

1033
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:55,262
Or one with a motor?

1034
01:11:57,597 --> 01:11:58,495
One with a motor.

1035
01:12:00,304 --> 01:12:02,601
Well, good luck with that.
I wish her well.

1036
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:06,057
Not so long Skailer.

1037
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:12,691
You guys staying in one of the cottages
here?

1038
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:18,598
Yes, my husband had to come here for
work, so we thought wed all make a little vacation of it.

1039
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:20,366
He knows the owner, so...

1040
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,133
- Hugh King.
- Thats right.

1041
01:12:22,168 --> 01:12:23,197
Hes my cousin.

1042
01:12:23,232 --> 01:12:26,781
Oh. Then you probably know my husband.
Brian Speer?

1043
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:31,038
No, cant say as I do.

1044
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,201
Oh, I just assumed, since hes been...

1045
01:12:35,409 --> 01:12:36,168
Dad!

1046
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:37,770
Something bit me!

1047
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:40,634
Nice talking to you.

1048
01:12:41,702 --> 01:12:43,018
You too. Take care.

1049
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:34,817
Theres Cousin Hugh.

1050
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:36,669
Get us a table.
Order me something.

1051
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,369
What do you want?

1052
01:13:37,404 --> 01:13:38,026
Anything.

1053
01:13:45,646 --> 01:13:46,256
Hey, Hugh?

1054
01:13:47,242 --> 01:13:49,724
Heeey! Mattie-boy!

1055
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:51,474
What are you doing
here?

1056
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:53,545
I didnt expect to see you until the meeting.

1057
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:56,410
Just getting the girls out of the
hospital for a couple days,

1058
01:13:56,411 --> 01:13:58,913
- Oh, these are...
- Scottie and Alex.

1059
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:00,620
Big girls now!

1060
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:03,150
Yes, just needed
a change of scenery.

1061
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,918
Yeah, boy, what youve been going
through. Thats a tough deal.

1062
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:06,637
Yes.

1063
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:10,234
But Elizabeth, hey, shes, shes a
tough gal, Ill tell you that.

1064
01:14:10,235 --> 01:14:12,142
A fighter. Shell make it.

1065
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:13,698
Get you a drink?

1066
01:14:14,138 --> 01:14:15,968
Yes, whatre you have

1067
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,698
- Julia?
- Hey.

1068
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,804
- an old-fashioned for my cousin here.
- all right.

1069
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,227
- Glad to see you, Matt.
- Me too.

1070
01:14:23,678 --> 01:14:25,118
How you been otherwise?

1071
01:14:26,055 --> 01:14:27,404
Not much otherwise.

1072
01:14:27,493 --> 01:14:30,666
Between our business and the hospital, you know,
trying to keep my head above water.

1073
01:14:31,949 --> 01:14:34,513
listen, I see you have some
people staying in the cottage.

1074
01:14:35,823 --> 01:14:38,217
Oh, hey, Mattie, if Id known you were
coming, I coulda...

1075
01:14:38,218 --> 01:14:41,034
No, no, no, not that at all.

1076
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:42,891
Im just wondering about
the guy youre renting to.

1077
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:44,951
I think his
name is Brian Speer.

1078
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:48,987
Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a-bitch.

1079
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:51,334
Hes Lous sisters...

1080
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:55,320
No, wait. Lou has a sister, and the
sisters husband

1081
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:58,370
Lous brother-in-law is cousins with that guy.

1082
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:01,880
Whos Lou?

1083
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:07,152
No, wait. You mean the cottages on the
bay or the cottage back by the trail?

1084
01:15:07,187 --> 01:15:09,796
The bay. The guy with the wife and two
boys.

1085
01:15:10,024 --> 01:15:12,780
Yeah, thats right. Determined son-of-
a- bitch.

1086
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:17,831
Anyway, the point is the guy were doing
business with is that guys brother-in-law.

1087
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:18,859
Works for him.

1088
01:15:19,021 --> 01:15:20,544
What do you mean, the guy were doing
business with?

1089
01:15:20,907 --> 01:15:26,574
Who do you think? Don!
Who else? Holitzer.

1090
01:15:27,226 --> 01:15:27,921
Holitzer.

1091
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:32,013
Thats what Im saying. Thats Dons
brother-in-law in the cottage.

1092
01:15:32,545 --> 01:15:33,896
Brian Speer.

1093
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:37,210
You dont know him? I would have thought
youd know him. Hes a realtor over by you.

1094
01:15:37,524 --> 01:15:39,209
So if we sell to Don

1095
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:41,710
and thats what were going to do, right?
Thats what you want too.

1096
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,050
Nice guy, Don. Hell do right by us.

1097
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:49,822
Then when Don develops and re-sells and
leases and all that...

1098
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:53,134
Hes letting this brother-in-law in the
cottage handle the transactions.

1099
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:54,298
A lot of them, anyway.

1100
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,082
Big score for that guy.

1101
01:16:05,615 --> 01:16:09,605
This afternoon will be
us a good voice, my nephew.

1102
01:16:09,617 --> 01:16:10,736
From here the Ke'ola.

1103
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,158
Hugh, what's he like?

1104
01:16:14,432 --> 01:16:15,124
Who?

1105
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,133
Brian Speer

1106
01:16:17,168 --> 01:16:18,540
what else do you know
about him?

1107
01:16:18,586 --> 01:16:24,413
Not much. Hes lucky. Son-of-a-bitch is going
to make a shitload of money on commissions.

1108
01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:27,349
Not if we dont go with that bid.

1109
01:16:31,534 --> 01:16:32,987
We all want Don.

1110
01:16:34,004 --> 01:16:36,155
You do too, Matt.
Youve said as much.

1111
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:44,168
Yes. i'm just... You're right.

1112
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,187
Hugh, Good to see you, Hugh.

1113
01:16:51,988 --> 01:16:53,181
You too.

1114
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:56,671
- See you at the meeting.
- Ill be there.

1115
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,040
This place rocks.

1116
01:17:27,221 --> 01:17:28,776
Totally.

1117
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:31,893
We ordered you mahi.

1118
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:34,608
Great.

1119
01:18:03,527 --> 01:18:05,643
Well, guess what. That
woman on the beach today...

1120
01:18:05,678 --> 01:18:06,778
That was his wife.

1121
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:08,642
- Whose wife?
- Brian Speer

1122
01:18:08,736 --> 01:18:09,400
What?

1123
01:18:10,156 --> 01:18:11,192
The hottie with the hat?

1124
01:18:11,227 --> 01:18:12,229
Yes.
- Are you sure?

1125
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:12,726
Yes.

1126
01:18:12,727 --> 01:18:14,319
So hes married.

1127
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:18,343
- Why didnt you say anything?
- Its him I want to talk to, not her.

1128
01:18:18,521 --> 01:18:19,854
I know where their cottage is.

1129
01:18:20,457 --> 01:18:21,186
You do?

1130
01:18:21,316 --> 01:18:23,155
So lets do it right now.
Lets go knock on his door.

1131
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,038
Thats what Im saying.

1132
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:28,057
Dont do that. Dont be excited. This
isnt fun.

1133
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:29,429
Well, its what we came here to do.

1134
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:30,660
Right.

1135
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:33,831
So you to talk to his wife while I talk
to him.

1136
01:18:33,866 --> 01:18:36,629
And figure out some way to
distract Scottie and their kids.

1137
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:38,286
Got it.

1138
01:18:38,442 --> 01:18:39,303
Sid, come here.

1139
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,992
Give em hell, boss.

1140
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,126
Come on, Sid.

1141
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:45,528
Ok

1142
01:18:56,908 --> 01:18:58,444
Im sorry for sucking you into this.

1143
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,091
should be doing this alone.

1144
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:02,130
- Its selfish of me.
- Im the one who sucked you in.

1145
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:03,391
Im the one who knew.

1146
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:12,240
Dont be a pussy.

1147
01:19:13,493 --> 01:19:14,376
Hi there!

1148
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:17,703
Its the guy from the beach today.

1149
01:19:17,828 --> 01:19:19,275
Oh, hello.

1150
01:19:19,336 --> 01:19:21,458
Yeah, hey, Im such an idiot.

1151
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,615
I just figured out I do know your husband.

1152
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:30,057
My daughter and I were on our way back to the hotel from dinner,
and we thought wed drop by and say howdy.

1153
01:19:31,469 --> 01:19:33,074
- Great. Come on up.
Yes.

1154
01:19:33,717 --> 01:19:36,754
Im Matt King. This is Alexandra.

1155
01:19:37,385 --> 01:19:38,700
- Im Julie Speer.
- Hi.

1156
01:19:38,701 --> 01:19:42,007
Yeah, I thought that was you.
Youve been in the paper so much lately.

1157
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:44,885
I figured you had to know
Brian. Hes been pretty involved.

1158
01:19:44,886 --> 01:19:46,518
Yeah, no, I know, yeah, super-involved.

1159
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:49,304
Maybe Ive met him in passing.
I dont know.

1160
01:19:49,454 --> 01:19:53,877
So, I guess you guys are deciding really soon.
A couple of days, right right... you and your family meet?

1161
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:57,104
Im sorry. Thats probably a conflict
of interest or something.

1162
01:19:57,105 --> 01:19:58,524
No, its okay. Youre right

1163
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:00,775
itll all be over in a couple of days.

1164
01:20:02,352 --> 01:20:03,749
You guys want a lasagna?

1165
01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:05,236
No, thanks We just ate,

1166
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:06,772
A drink then.

1167
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:07,750
sure

1168
01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:08,924
Red wine, iced tea?

1169
01:20:08,925 --> 01:20:09,697
- Perfect.
Yes.

1170
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:10,302
Hello!

1171
01:20:10,303 --> 01:20:11,900
- Hi.
- Hey.

1172
01:20:12,702 --> 01:20:14,110
Hi, Im Brian.

1173
01:20:14,232 --> 01:20:16,433
Brian, we may have met before.

1174
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:17,662
Matt King.

1175
01:20:18,204 --> 01:20:21,187
My wife is Elizabeth King.
I think you may have met her too.

1176
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:23,344
And this is her daughter, Alexandra.

1177
01:20:23,772 --> 01:20:25,589
I was just going to get drinks.

1178
01:20:27,043 --> 01:20:28,167
Good, good. Good.

1179
01:20:28,844 --> 01:20:30,584
- Do you need help?
No, no, I got it.

1180
01:20:34,364 --> 01:20:35,652
Elizabeth is dying.

1181
01:20:37,534 --> 01:20:39,173
Oh, wait. Fuck
you

1182
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:40,940
And shes dying.

1183
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,396
We unhooked her from the machines this morning.
Shell be dead in a few days.

1184
01:20:47,808 --> 01:20:49,192
- This is him?
- Mmchmm.

1185
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,782
- How would she go for him?
- Beats me.

1186
01:20:51,909 --> 01:20:53,877
Well, hes very articulate.

1187
01:20:56,278 --> 01:20:58,503
Im sorry. I never thought
it would come to this.

1188
01:20:58,593 --> 01:21:00,108
Youre sorry my moms going to die?

1189
01:21:00,143 --> 01:21:03,018
Youre sorry you fucked her?
Youre sorry you fucked over my dad?

1190
01:21:04,012 --> 01:21:05,250
Im sorry for all of it.

1191
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:09,358
Look, pal, like she said, Im not here to wreck your life. I just came to
give you a chance to go to the hospital.

1192
01:21:09,924 --> 01:21:13,545
I dont know how long youre planning on being
here, but Im sure you can think of an excuse to leave.

1193
01:21:13,732 --> 01:21:14,887
You must be good at that.

1194
01:21:14,922 --> 01:21:17,356
You can be alone with her to say
goodbye or whatever

1195
01:21:18,846 --> 01:21:19,640
Do you hear what Im saying?

1196
01:21:20,302 --> 01:21:22,642
Okay, look, I cant have you here. You
understand.

1197
01:21:23,857 --> 01:21:24,691
Here we go.

1198
01:21:27,636 --> 01:21:28,548
Thank you.

1199
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:33,025
Everyones so serious. Please dont
tell me youre talking about business.

1200
01:21:33,785 --> 01:21:35,041
Were talking about love.

1201
01:21:35,288 --> 01:21:36,305
This is nice.

1202
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,718
Brian, call the boys in for dinner.

1203
01:21:38,753 --> 01:21:40,943
Theyre fine. Let them play a while
longer.

1204
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:48,229
Awesome cottage youre renting.

1205
01:21:48,264 --> 01:21:50,495
Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location.

1206
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:53,667
I used to come here as a kid before it
was a vacation property.

1207
01:21:54,192 --> 01:21:58,291
Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian
built it back in the 20s.

1208
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,524
Havent been
inside in years.

1209
01:22:00,525 --> 01:22:02,002
Come on. Well give you a tour.

1210
01:22:02,037 --> 01:22:06,621
Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little
walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here.

1211
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:08,886
Yeah, Id like that, if you dont mind.

1212
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:09,745
Just a quick look.

1213
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:16,457
Yes. But its not like I live here anything.
but OK

1214
01:22:17,809 --> 01:22:18,986
Can you keep it?

1215
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:20,722
Go from here.

1216
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:33,044
Here it is.

1217
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,812
How did you meet? Im curious

1218
01:22:37,278 --> 01:22:38,347
I cant do this.

1219
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:40,062
Neither can I. How did you meet?

1220
01:22:40,652 --> 01:22:42,628
I thought you said you came here just
to tell me.

1221
01:22:43,353 --> 01:22:46,889
I changed my mind. And I cant very
well ask her the details. can I

1222
01:22:48,419 --> 01:22:49,217
Howd you meet?

1223
01:22:51,809 --> 01:22:52,670
At a party.

1224
01:22:53,328 --> 01:22:55,172
- What party?
Super Bowl party

1225
01:22:58,058 --> 01:22:59,074
At the Mitchells

1226
01:23:00,064 --> 01:23:01,694
Does that help? Does that make it
better?

1227
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:05,741
Hey, Im doing you a favor here. I
could go out there right now and fuck you up,

1228
01:23:05,776 --> 01:23:07,207
so get a better attitude.

1229
01:23:08,815 --> 01:23:09,764
Then what?

1230
01:23:10,339 --> 01:23:12,385
Howd you get the nerve to ask
her out?

1231
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:15,051
Was it about the deal?
Is that when you decided she was for you?

1232
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:15,229
No.

1233
01:23:15,766 --> 01:23:16,981
Its not what you think.

1234
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:18,551
It just happened.

1235
01:23:18,748 --> 01:23:19,907
Nothing just happens.

1236
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:21,150
Everything just happens.

1237
01:23:23,186 --> 01:23:24,264
Was she going to leave me?

1238
01:23:25,017 --> 01:23:26,109
She would have.

1239
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,784
But I, I, uh... I
didnt want that happened.

1240
01:23:29,127 --> 01:23:30,695
I love Julie.

1241
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:34,447
Please dont tell her.

1242
01:23:35,657 --> 01:23:36,767
Please.

1243
01:23:37,658 --> 01:23:40,138
I dont know what Ive done. Im sorry.

1244
01:23:41,735 --> 01:23:43,350
Did she say she loved you?

1245
01:23:54,742 --> 01:23:55,718
Do you love her?

1246
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:04,587
You dont love her.

1247
01:24:05,767 --> 01:24:08,611
You dont love
her. You just used her to get to me.

1248
01:24:09,217 --> 01:24:11,042
No, I told you. I wasnt trying to get
to you.

1249
01:24:12,045 --> 01:24:12,945
It was an affair,

1250
01:24:13,878 --> 01:24:18,537
an attraction. Sex. And she got sort of... carried away
with the whole thing, and I guess I went with it.

1251
01:24:18,547 --> 01:24:22,130
I mean, I didnt exactly
say no to things. I should have. I love my family.

1252
01:24:23,383 --> 01:24:27,586
Then I guess its all working out. Her lips are sealed,
and you dont have to go through the trouble of dumping her.

1253
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:32,753
Hey, hey, thats really unfair. I had..
have... a lot of respect for her.

1254
01:24:33,676 --> 01:24:35,035
Shes a wonderful woman.

1255
01:24:37,216 --> 01:24:38,765
One more question fot you

1256
01:24:40,272 --> 01:24:40,888
Yes?

1257
01:24:43,426 --> 01:24:44,914
Have you ever been inside my bedroom?

1258
01:24:50,714 --> 01:24:51,676
Once.

1259
01:24:57,524 --> 01:24:59,586
You could have had the decency to lie
about that one.

1260
01:25:01,223 --> 01:25:01,943
Okay, two.

1261
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:10,593
Well, shes in Queens
Hospital if you want to say goodbye.

1262
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,426
That really is all I came to say.

1263
01:25:18,528 --> 01:25:21,546
that's great, all remodeled, new
appliances.

1264
01:25:21,682 --> 01:25:22,393
Nice.

1265
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:24,384
Alex, I think we should go.

1266
01:25:25,307 --> 01:25:27,392
Well, hey, thanks for stopping by.

1267
01:25:27,564 --> 01:25:30,089
Really nice to meet you both. Maybe
well see you at the beach tomorrow.

1268
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,069
Yes, maybe.

1269
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,298
Nice to meet you.

1270
01:25:57,748 --> 01:25:58,330
Hey.

1271
01:25:58,815 --> 01:26:00,419
So when do you think hell show up?

1272
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:02,508
I have no idea.

1273
01:26:02,582 --> 01:26:04,108
Was he sorry?

1274
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,189
I hope he was sorry, man.

1275
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:08,716
You could have told his wife, and
you didnt.

1276
01:26:08,888 --> 01:26:12,913
I would say everything. I mean..
I hope he knows how lucky he is.

1277
01:26:12,948 --> 01:26:14,830
She deserves to know.

1278
01:26:14,831 --> 01:26:17,684
Or else shes going to be a dumb bitch the
rest of her life.

1279
01:26:17,685 --> 01:26:18,373
Sid.

1280
01:26:18,749 --> 01:26:19,814
Im just saying.

1281
01:26:20,669 --> 01:26:22,322
No need to get creepy about it

1282
01:26:23,434 --> 01:26:25,360
Anyway, doesnt
matter. Thats all behind us.

1283
01:26:25,957 --> 01:26:30,409
Yeah, the one we have to worry about
telling things to now is Scottie.

1284
01:26:32,113 --> 01:26:35,733
Ive asked Dr. Johnston to help us
break the news tomorrow.

1285
01:28:36,865 --> 01:28:37,620
Here we are.

1286
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:40,744
Hey.

1287
01:28:42,394 --> 01:28:43,448
- Hey, Barry.
- Hey.

1288
01:28:47,023 --> 01:28:48,232
- Hi, Alice.
- Hey, Barry.

1289
01:28:48,394 --> 01:28:49,842
- Hi, Alex.
- Glad to see you.

1290
01:28:51,045 --> 01:28:51,742
Scott.

1291
01:28:52,136 --> 01:28:53,138
Hi, Tutu.

1292
01:28:54,581 --> 01:28:59,469
Alex, we will... e.. bring some
chairs for Tutu, right?

1293
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:07,372
There you are again.

1294
01:29:13,402 --> 01:29:14,060
so...

1295
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,420
what did you decide?

1296
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,227
Theres not much left to decide.

1297
01:29:19,262 --> 01:29:21,580
Were just sort of playing it by ear and
making sure shes comfortable.

1298
01:29:21,615 --> 01:29:23,294
I mean what did you decide about the
buyer?

1299
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:24,823
Whos your buyer?

1300
01:29:25,843 --> 01:29:26,822
How much are you getting?

1301
01:29:28,255 --> 01:29:29,089
Dad...

1302
01:29:29,545 --> 01:29:31,545
Im sure youll be able to read
about it in the paper.

1303
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:34,387
I dont need to read about it. I can
hear about it right now.

1304
01:29:34,422 --> 01:29:36,359
Scott, lets not talk about that here.
Its not the time for that.

1305
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,743
All the same to you, I guess. A
million here, a million there.

1306
01:29:40,397 --> 01:29:42,105
Just ironic, thats all

1307
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:46,790
Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as youre
coming into a fortune.

1308
01:29:48,686 --> 01:29:50,083
She gave you
everything, Matt.

1309
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:52,894
A good, happy home,
two beautiful daughters.

1310
01:29:52,895 --> 01:29:53,479
Scott, whats your point?

1311
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:56,002
She wanted her own boat. She should
have had her own boat,

1312
01:29:56,133 --> 01:29:58,566
- one she would have been familiar with.
- She wasnt even driving!

1313
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,758
Her boat,
someone elses boat... it wouldnt matter

1314
01:30:01,903 --> 01:30:03,171
Youre not going
to blame me for this.

1315
01:30:04,212 --> 01:30:05,664
quibble about the details.

1316
01:30:06,745 --> 01:30:09,590
She was a faithful, devoted wife. She
deserved more.

1317
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:18,734
Youre right. She deserved more.

1318
01:30:20,447 --> 01:30:21,770
For Christs sake,

1319
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,026
take it easy on the man.

1320
01:30:23,061 --> 01:30:27,117
You know, My father has been doing a really
amazing job under the circumstances.

1321
01:30:39,528 --> 01:30:40,594
Are we leaving?

1322
01:30:40,622 --> 01:30:41,982
No, Mom, not yet.

1323
01:30:49,981 --> 01:30:51,500
Man, that guys a prick.

1324
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:53,512
Was he always
like that?

1325
01:30:53,925 --> 01:30:54,735
Yes.

1326
01:34:33,329 --> 01:34:37,490
Well, no surprise. Other than the
hold outs who dont want to sell at all,

1327
01:34:37,702 --> 01:34:40,120
its Don Holitzer.
Chicago group a distant second.

1328
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:41,474
Feels good.

1329
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,326
Were doing the right thing, Mattie.

1330
01:34:43,663 --> 01:34:45,612
At least there aint going to be any
Wal-Mart.

1331
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:47,685
All right.

1332
01:34:49,508 --> 01:34:51,929
Now its your call, and
were all behind you,

1333
01:34:52,152 --> 01:34:53,466
most of us anyway.

1334
01:34:54,459 --> 01:34:56,312
Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.

1335
01:35:10,298 --> 01:35:11,425
Its strange, thats all.

1336
01:35:13,276 --> 01:35:14,362
Whats strange?

1337
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:19,627
We didnt do anything to own that land.
It was entrusted to us.

1338
01:35:20,283 --> 01:35:21,109
And now were just...

1339
01:35:31,765 --> 01:35:32,875
I cant do it.

1340
01:35:34,048 --> 01:35:34,771
I wont do it.

1341
01:35:34,965 --> 01:35:36,541
- What do you mean?
- Im not going to sign.

1342
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:41,979
Whatre you doing, Matt?

1343
01:35:43,148 --> 01:35:47,133
I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now,
but youre not going to fuck this up for us.

1344
01:35:47,259 --> 01:35:48,062
Its over.

1345
01:35:50,337 --> 01:35:51,809
I dont want it to go to Holitzer.

1346
01:35:52,811 --> 01:35:54,005
I dont want it to go to anyone.

1347
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,251
I want to keep it.

1348
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:58,586
Your heads not right, Mattie.

1349
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:00,119
Your heads not right.

1350
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:04,126
You want a couple
days to think it over? Take a couple days.

1351
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:08,522
dont need a couple days. I have the
authority, and this is what I want.

1352
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:13,885
We have other businesses were
converting to corporations. We can figure it out.

1353
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:15,927
Youre the trustee.

1354
01:36:16,112 --> 01:36:18,741
You know better than anyone we
only have seven years left.

1355
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:21,896
Then I have seven years to figure out
how to keep it.

1356
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:30,847
Well come after you.

1357
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:35,464
Just because youre a lawyer doesnt mean the rest
of us would be afraid to come after you.

1358
01:36:36,609 --> 01:36:38,441
But nobody wants to do that.

1359
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:41,640
Were family.

1360
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:46,871
People will be relieved, Hugh, the
whole state.

1361
01:36:48,589 --> 01:36:52,419
I sign that document, Something
that was ours to protect will be gone.

1362
01:36:52,454 --> 01:36:54,637
were haole as shit

1363
01:36:55,572 --> 01:37:00,200
and go to private schools and clubs and cant
even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian,

1364
01:37:02,019 --> 01:37:03,659
But we have Hawaiian blood.

1365
01:37:04,347 --> 01:37:05,894
and were still tied to this land.

1366
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,180
And our children are tied to this land.

1367
01:37:09,275 --> 01:37:15,149
Its a miracle that for whatever bullshit
reason 150 years ago, we own this much of... paradise, but we do.

1368
01:37:15,938 --> 01:37:21,376
And for whatever bullshit reason now,
Im the trustee.

1369
01:37:22,515 --> 01:37:23,695
And Im not signing.

1370
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:27,051
And if you sue me, itll only make us closer.

1371
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:41,840
All right.

1372
01:37:44,407 --> 01:37:46,761
everybody, listen up.

1373
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:51,635
Cousin Mattie has an announcement.

1374
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:54,532
Get ready.

1375
01:38:58,772 --> 01:38:59,472
come in

1376
01:39:17,657 --> 01:39:18,419
Julie?

1377
01:39:19,565 --> 01:39:24,579
I know we just met, but I was thinking
about you guys these past few days,

1378
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:28,205
I knew your mom was here. I dont
know. I just felt I should stop by.

1379
01:39:30,932 --> 01:39:32,089
You remember Alex.

1380
01:39:32,124 --> 01:39:32,707
- Hi.
- Hi.

1381
01:39:32,742 --> 01:39:35,937
This is Scottie.
Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.

1382
01:39:35,972 --> 01:39:36,573
Julie.

1383
01:39:37,259 --> 01:39:37,631
Julie.

1384
01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:39,024
Were you friends with my mom?

1385
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:43,122
No, we never met. But I know a lot
about her.

1386
01:39:45,587 --> 01:39:48,612
Look, Julie, we appreciate your coming by.

1387
01:39:50,363 --> 01:39:51,466
The flowers are lovely.

1388
01:39:55,091 --> 01:39:59,427
- Scottie, Alex. Lets go to the cafeteria.
- Okay. Yes.

1389
01:39:59,462 --> 01:40:00,648
Come get up Scotty.

1390
01:40:00,683 --> 01:40:03,162
- I come.
- Come on, Scotty.

1391
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:06,571
I wanted two more seconds.

1392
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:09,365
- Scotty.
- comeing!

1393
01:40:22,604 --> 01:40:25,958
I, uh, Im not sure how much you know
about my wifes condition,

1394
01:40:27,025 --> 01:40:28,592
but shes
going to die very soon.

1395
01:40:29,788 --> 01:40:31,464
Basically for this reason we are here.

1396
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:32,774
I know.

1397
01:40:34,005 --> 01:40:36,184
Thats why I came. Because I
know.

1398
01:40:40,723 --> 01:40:42,349
I came because Brian wouldnt.

1399
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,525
And that just didnt seem right. I thought someone from my
family should come.

1400
01:40:48,134 --> 01:40:49,057
So he told you, huh?

1401
01:40:49,731 --> 01:40:54,631
he was acting really weird. that night,
After you left Then I started smelling it all over him.

1402
01:40:56,901 --> 01:40:58,200
Id already smelled it.

1403
01:40:59,964 --> 01:41:03,187
I finally got it out of him. Weve
been going crazy ever since.

1404
01:41:03,222 --> 01:41:06,684
Not easy
with the kids around.

1405
01:41:08,825 --> 01:41:11,089
Its all
something I never could have imagined.

1406
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:16,817
And then your familys decision about
the land. I think youre doing the right thing,

1407
01:41:16,852 --> 01:41:22,012
but Brian is... well, its
all so complicated and confusing.

1408
01:41:23,093 --> 01:41:23,676
I know.

1409
01:41:27,567 --> 01:41:28,718
Im angry,

1410
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,189
but Im just so sorry.

1411
01:41:33,368 --> 01:41:35,600
I cant imagine what youre going
through.

1412
01:41:37,441 --> 01:41:39,153
Do you mind if I say
something to her?

1413
01:41:42,775 --> 01:41:43,812
Ok

1414
01:41:57,365 --> 01:41:59,036
Elizabeth, Im Julie.

1415
01:42:00,538 --> 01:42:01,932
Brians wife.

1416
01:42:08,576 --> 01:42:09,903
I just wanted to tell you...

1417
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,265
I just want to tell you I forgive you.

1418
01:42:19,686 --> 01:42:22,146
I forgive you for trying to take Brian away

1419
01:42:24,178 --> 01:42:27,652
I forgive you for almost destroying my
family.

1420
01:42:29,889 --> 01:42:31,878
Why should I forgive you...

1421
01:42:32,248 --> 01:42:34,831
I have to forgive you.

1422
01:42:34,973 --> 01:42:37,063
Even though I want to hate you.

1423
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:38,779
Okay. Thats enough,

1424
01:42:38,814 --> 01:42:40,162
I have to forgive you.

1425
01:42:40,197 --> 01:42:41,633
Frankly, I think that is enough.

1426
01:42:41,668 --> 01:42:43,005
Okay? Come, go.

1427
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,342
Thank you, Julie.

1428
01:42:49,489 --> 01:42:51,339
He didnt love her. Just so you know.

1429
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,215
He didnt really love her.

1430
01:42:54,645 --> 01:42:56,259
That's why I came.

1431
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:00,181
All right.

1432
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:10,216
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

1433
01:44:13,683 --> 01:44:15,008
Goodbye, my love.

1434
01:44:17,183 --> 01:44:18,232
my friend,

1435
01:44:19,954 --> 01:44:21,139
my pain,

1436
01:44:23,076 --> 01:44:24,204
my joy.

1437
01:44:28,879 --> 01:44:30,347
Goodbye.

1438
01:44:32,211 --> 01:44:33,177
Goodbye.

1439
01:44:34,427 --> 01:44:35,476
Goodbye.

1440
01:47:32,335 --> 01:47:33,256
I guess that is

1441
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:18,863
<i>are very few places that are difficult
can go in this world...</ i></i>

1442
01:48:19,187 --> 01:48:21,570
<i>...but there are others
be more difficult to live.</ i></i>

1443
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:27,867
<i>The average temperature here in the bottom
of the earth is about 50 degrees below.</ i></i>

1444
01:48:27,956 --> 01:48:28,993
With strawberry.

1445
01:48:29,893 --> 01:48:30,954
one scoop mocha chip.

1446
01:48:31,448 --> 01:48:32,291
Great.

1447
01:48:33,457 --> 01:48:35,694
<i>Antarctica used to be tropical place.</ i></i>

1448
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,437
<i>With dense forests and bustling.</ i></i>

1449
01:48:39,467 --> 01:48:41,983
<i>But then the continents
began to move south.</ i></i>

1450
01:48:42,501 --> 01:48:47,480
<i>And to finish the move forests
were replaced by a new territory.</ i></i>

1451
01:48:47,515 --> 01:48:48,052
<i>Ice</i>

1452
01:48:53,114 --> 01:48:57,409
<i>As for the old residents, all
died or moved long ago.</ i></i>

1453
01:48:57,908 --> 01:49:00,377
<i>Basically, almost all of them.</ i></i>

1454
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:05,979
<i>The royal penguin
is essentially a bird.</ i></i>

1455
01:49:06,786 --> 01:49:09,024
<i>Only he makes
the home of the sea.</ i></i>

1456
01:49:10,346 --> 01:49:13,629
<i>And if you wonder what
done here on the ice, then...</ i></i>

1457
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,848
<i>This is another story.</ i></i>

1458
01:49:16,529 --> 01:49:18,963
<i>is here around the same time</ i></i>

1459
01:49:18,998 --> 01:49:23,273
<i>who wants to leave the ocean's house
and begin a memorable trip.</i>

1460
01:49:23,665 --> 01:49:25,893
<i>They traveled a long distance...</i>
