1
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,326
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,033
It was our aunt's.

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
We used to come here as kids.

4
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,626
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

5
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,050
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,432
Muggles think these keep
evil away, but they're wrong.

7
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,844
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,983
How are you?

9
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,490
Alive.

10
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,959
You probably don't remember...

11
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,292
That I showed you to your vault the
first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,000
Even amongst goblins
you're famous, Harry Potter.

13
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,471
You buried the elf.

14
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,006
Yes.

15
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,891
And brought me here.

16
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,599
You are...

17
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,812
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,613
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,491
It's complicated.

20
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,251
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,499
It's complicated.

22
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,389
The sword presented itself
to us in a moment of need.

23
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,308
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,728
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,517
...but it is a fake.

26
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,356
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,863
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,902
Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,785
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,415
A Hogwarts professor. As I
understand it, he's now headmaster.

31
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,247
Snape?

32
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,958
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,710
Why?

34
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,470
There are more than a few curious
things in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,382
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

36
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,264
Perhaps.

37
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,063
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,897
This is impossible.

39
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,985
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,571
Why should I help you?

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,490
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,706
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,417
That.

44
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,089
That is my price.

45
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,814
Are you thinking
there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,480
She was terrified when
she thought we'd been in there.

47
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,523
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

48
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,614
I bet you there's a Horcrux in
there, another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,746
Let's find it and kill it, we're
one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,702
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,290
How are we supposed to destroy it now
you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,499
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,128
He's weak.

54
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,143
Yes?

55
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,975
Mr. Ollivander, I need to
ask you a few questions.

56
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,940
OLLIVANDER: Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,489
Would you mind
identifying this wand?

58
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,275
We need to know if it's safe to use.

59
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,995
Walnut.

60
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,461
Dragon heartstring.

61
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,877
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,675
Unyie...

63
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,426
Unyielding.

64
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,760
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,726
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,724
And this?

67
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,024
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,941
And unicorn hair.

69
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,783
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,875
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,082
Was? Is it
not still?

72
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,378
Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.

73
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,385
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,982
You talk about wands as
if they have feelings...

75
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,192
...can think.

76
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,037
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,543
That much has always been clear to
those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,089
And what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,260
It is rumored there are three:

80
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,102
The Elder Wand...

81
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,101
...the Cloak of Invisibility to
hide you from your enemies...

82
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:42,114
...and the Resurrection Stone to
bring back loved ones from the dead.

83
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:47,278
Together, they make
one the master of death.

84
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:53,542
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,373
Do you?

86
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,125
Do you believe they exist, sir?

87
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:08,262
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

88
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,932
You're lying.

89
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,395
You know one exists.

90
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,396
You told him about it.

91
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:21,107
You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.

92
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,692
He tortured me.

93
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
Besides...

94
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,908
...I only conveyed rumors.

95
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,206
There's...

96
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,586
There's no telling whether he will find it.

97
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,504
He has found it, sir.

98
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,182
We'll let you rest.

99
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,100
OLLIVANDER: He's after you, Mr. Potter.

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,528
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

101
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,031
...I'm afraid...

102
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,534
...you really don't stand a chance.

103
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,334
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill
him before he finds me, then.

104
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,759
Are you sure that's hers?

105
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,049
Positive.

106
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,720
Well?

107
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,647
How do I look?

108
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,732
Hideous.

109
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,646
You can give that to Hermione
to hold, all right, Griphook?

110
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,670
We're relying on you.

111
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,883
If you get us past the guards and
into the vault, the sword's yours.

use that sword to slit our own throats.

119

00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,193

anything about getting you out.

the Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

I reckon he'll stop at nothing to
make sure we don't find the rest.

- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

228
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,717
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

229

We can't do that. We've got to
plan. We've got to figure it out.

- Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.

Albus told me.

He also told me you'd likely be hacked
off if you ever found out I had it...

would you be if I didn't?

- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

where to start. You're lying!

she's ordinary and you're special.

father. Lazy. Arrogant.

DUMBLEDORE: The prophecy
did not refer to a woman.

722
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,492
It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.

723
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,911
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

724
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,668
He intends to hunt them
down now, to kill them.

725

Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

give me in exchange, Severus?

727

738
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,762

He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

740

The Dark Lord will return.

741

And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger.

reveal the best of you, Severus?

01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,999
DUMBLEDORE: When you risk your
life every day to protect the boy?

748

his arrogance rivals that of his father...

...and he seems to relish his fame.

word against my father.

Lazy, arrogant.

01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,350

DRACO: Harmonia Nectere Passus.

762
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:49,703
We both know Lord Voldemort has
ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

763
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:56,000
But should he fail, one should
presume the Dark Lord...

764
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,294
...will turn to you.

765
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,971
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

766
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,307
It is the only way.

767
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:12,642
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.

768
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,482
SNAPE: Avada Kedavra.

769
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:23,658
DUMBLEDORE: There will come a time
when Harry Potter must be told something.

770
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:30,414
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

771
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,500
Must be told what?

772
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,710
DUMBLEDORE: On the
night Lord Voldemort...

773
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,093
...went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

774
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,804
...and Lily Potter cast
herself between them...

775
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,512
...the curse rebounded.

776
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:50,931
When that happened, a
part of Voldemort's soul...

777
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:55,943
...latched itself onto the only
living thing it could find:

778
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,274
Harry himself.

779
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:03,030
There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes.

780
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,453
There's a reason he can look
into Lord Voldemort's mind.

781
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:14,879
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

782
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,263
So when the time comes...

783
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,303
...the boy must die?

784
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,266
Yes. Yes.

785
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,681
He must die.

786
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:56,837
You've kept him alive so that he
can die at the proper moment.

787
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,093
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

788
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,674
Don't tell me now that you've
grown to care for the boy?

789
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,432
SNAPE: Expecto Patronum.

790
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,861
Lily.

791
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,116
After all this time?

792
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,042
Always.

793
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:48,173
So when the time comes...

794
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:51,342
...the boy must die?

795
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,887
Yes. He must die.

796
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,057
And Voldemort himself must do it.

797
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,693
That is essential.

798
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,799
Where've you been?

799
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:10,133
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

800
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,265
Are you mad? No.

801
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,469
You can't give yourself up to him.

802
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,728
What is it, Harry?

803
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,190
What is it you know?

804
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,574
There's a reason I can hear them...

805
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,401
...the Horcruxes.

806
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,281
I think I've known for a while.

807
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,997
And I think you have too.

808
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:47,128
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

809
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,006
Kill the snake and then it's just him.

810
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,255
I'm ready to die.

811
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,965
The Resurrection Stone.

812
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:29,036
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

813
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,000
Why are you here?

814
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,590
All of you?

815
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,136
We never left.

816
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,609
Does it...?

817
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,523
Does it hurt'?

818
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,280
Dying?

819
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,739
Quicker than falling asleep.

820
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,952
You're nearly there, son.

821
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,332
I'm sorry.

822
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,996
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

823
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,207
And, Remus, your son...

824
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:19,628
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

825
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:23,265
One day, he'll understand.

826
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,565
You'll stay with me?

827
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,402
Until the end.

828
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:43,068
And he won't be able to see you?

829
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,908
SIRIUS: No.

830
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:48,790
We're here, you see.

831
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,386
Stay close to me.

832
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:09,265
Always.

833

835
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,513
Harry? No! What
are you doing here?

836
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:31,972
Quiet!

837
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,232
Harry Potter.

839
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,706
Come to die.

You brave, brave man.

845
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,926
Let us walk.

846
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,637
Professor, what is that?

847
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:44,355
Something beyond either of our help.

848
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:50,482
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

849
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,074
And exactly where are we?

850
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:57,323
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

851
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,207
Well...

852
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,993
...it looks like King's Cross station.

853
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:04,671
Only cleaner.

854
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,048
And without all the trains.

855
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,335
King's Cross, is that right?

856
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:14,263
This is, as they say, your party.

857
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:18,427
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

858
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,437
...have been connected by
something other than fate...

859
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:24,645
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.

860
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,526
So it's true then, sir?

861
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,688
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

862
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,022
Did.

863
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:36,036
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

864
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:41,792
You were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

865
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:55,884
I have to go back, haven't I?

866
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,924
Oh. That's up to you.

867
01:33:58,091 --> 01:33:59,889
I have a choice?

868
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,849
Oh, yes.

869
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,855
We're in King's Cross, you say?

870
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:10,733
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

871
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,490
And where would it take me?

True.

877
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,599
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

878

my ability to turn a phrase.

so humble opinion...

injury and remedying it.
