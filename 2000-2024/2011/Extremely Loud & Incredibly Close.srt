1
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:31,859
<i>There are more people alive now
than have died in all of human history.</i>

2
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,330
<i>But the number of dead people
is increasing.</i>

3
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:40,410
<i>One day, there isn't going to be
any room to bury anyone any more.</i>

4
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:46,347
<i>So, what about skyscrapers
for dead people that were built down?</i>

5
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:51,421
<i>They could be underneath the skyscrapers
for living people that are built up.</i>

6
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,957
<i>You could bury people
100 foors down...</i>

7
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,530
<i>...and a whole dead world
could be underneath the living one.</i>

8
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,095
...father of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us all with the gift of...

9
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,805
Doesn't anybody know
there isn't anybody in the coffin?

10
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,605
We should've filled it with his shoes
or something.

11
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,979
It's like a pretend funeral.

12
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,641
For a goldfish or something.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,514
This is just what it is, Oskar.

14
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,655
It doesn't make sense.

15
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,793
<i>What if you could ride an elevator
down to visit your dead relatives...</i>

16
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,023
<i>...just like you take the bridge
to see your friends in Brooklyn...</i>

17
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,395
<i>...or the ferry to Staten Island?</i>

18
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,561
<i>Dad once told me that New York
used to have a Sixth Borough...</i>

19
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,072
<i>...right next to Manhattan.</i>

20
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,471
<i>But you can't visit that any more...</i>

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,240
<i>...because it floated away
and no one knows where it is.</i>

22
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,276
Okay, you think you're so smart?

23
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,718
Let's find the Sixth Borough.

24
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,853
Okay.

25
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,222
And? What?

26
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,863
"And what" what?

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,464
What am I supposed to find?

28
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,826
What are the clues?

29
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,357
Mm.

30
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,130
<i>He shrugged his shoulders like he had
no idea what I was talking about.</i>

31
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,202
<i>I loved that.</i>

32
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,406
<i>This was my favorite game
Dad and I would play.</i>

33
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,139
<i>We called it
"Reconnaissance Expedition. "</i>

34
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,217
I found something from every decade
in the 20th Century.

35
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,116
You rack.

36
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,323
He racks!

37
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:46,797
<i>The search for the Sixth Borough
was the greatest expedition ever.</i>

38
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,934
All right, I've got
amateur entomologist, Francophile...

39
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,406
...amateur archeologist,
computer consultant.

40
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,942
Why "amateur" everything?

41
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,545
It's a compliment.

42
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,340
Amateur pacifist?

43
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,578
"Pacifist."
- Amateur inventor.

44
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,481
Inventor. Goad one.

45
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,881
Okay, you're all set.

46
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,327
<i>Dad designed my expeditions
so I would have to talk to people...</i>

47
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,026
<i>...which he knew
I had a hard time doing.</i>

48
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,067
What do you want?

49
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,053
What do you think?

50
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,782
Could be useful.

51
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,795
Can't you even tell me
if I'm an the right track?

52
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,858
But if you don't tell me,
haw can I ever be right?

53
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,503
Well, another way of lacking at it is...

54
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,235
...haw can you ever be wrung?

55
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,639
<i>Mm?</i>

56
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,884
There you go. Thank you very much.

57
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,165
<i>Central Park didn't use to be
where it is now.</i>

58
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,638
<i>Dad said it used to rest
in the center of the Sixth Borough.</i>

59
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,609
Enormous hooks were driven
deep into the ground...

60
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,010
...and the park was pulled by
all the people of New York...

61
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,642
...like a rug across the flour,
from the Sixth Borough into Manhattan.

62
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,656
I found something. Over!

63
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,858
What area, Oskar? Over!

64
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,060
Zane E-3. Over!

65
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,203
<i>Dad said it's only because
of the clues in Central Park...</i>

66
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,371
<i>...that we know
the Sixth Borough existed at all.</i>

67
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,420
Where's this from?

68
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,526
Oh, that was my father's.
Grandma gave it to me when I was little.

69
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,128
Never had much use for it.

70
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,791
What's this?

71
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,398
Oh. Grandma's old home movies.

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,937
Haven't seen these in years.

73
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,186
Do you know what your father
lacked like?

74
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,583
Nope, not a clue.

75
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,624
Here's what I do know:

76
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,624
He was from Dresden,
which was in Germany...

77
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,056
...went through some really bad stuff...

78
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,425
...and decided he wasn't up
to having a family.

79
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,192
That's it?
- That's it.

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,569
Did you always want to be a jeweler?

81
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,439
I might have liked
to have been a scientist.

82
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,741
I'll never know.

83
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,179
Why is that?

84
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,478
Because I'm a jeweler

85
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,224
Strawberry Fields.

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,055
Belvedere Castle.

87
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,527
What's he lacking far?

88
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,792
Well, when he finds it, let him tell you.

89
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,492
Gonna send him all aver the park...

90
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,195
...and he'll have to talk to
every single person he meets.

91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,465
It'll be the greatest
Reconnaissance Expedition.

92
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,903
Don't make it so hard an him.

93
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,771
If it was easy,
this wouldn't be worth finding.

94
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,345
And what kind of adult
is he gonna turn into?

95
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,379
I don't know.
That's what I have you far.

96
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,882
He'll be one of those guys who falls
in love with the very first bassy...

97
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,520
- Watch it.
- I mean, beautiful...

98
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,247
...flaxen-haired lady
who tells him what to do.

99
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,085
- Like write the check?
- Oh...

100
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,591
- Haw much?
- It's the last one. It's 71.40.

101
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,753
- $11.40.
- Where are you going?

102
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,395
Bedtime!

103
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,693
Was there really a Sixth Borough?

104
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,669
Well, as with anything, if you want
to believe, you can find reasons ta.

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,968
What reasons?

106
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,272
The clues, of course.

107
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,469
What clues?

108
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,444
What clues? The clues!

109
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,017
The peculiar fossil record
of Central Park.

110
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:33,350
The incongruous pH balance
of that reservoir.

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,517
And that brings us to the swings.

112
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,595
According to the paper of record, ahem

113
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:44,701
...a note was found beneath
one of those swings in Central Park.

114
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,100
And because of many scientific tests

115
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,504
...which you are tan young
and I am tan simple to understand...

116
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,237
...they were able to determine
that the note must have been written...

117
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,208
...in the Sixth Borough.

118
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,677
What did it say?

119
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,382
What a fantastic question.

120
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,953
Let's find cut.

121
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,487
Ah... It doesn't say.
It ought ta, but it doesn't.

122
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,392
- Can I see that?
- You want to see what?

123
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,998
Wanna see this? Na?

124
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,725
<i>That was the last conversation
we ever had.</i>

125
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,666
- Give it!
- It's behind you, behind you! Hold an.

126
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,221
<i>The next time I heard
my dad's voice...</i>

127
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,021
<i>...was when I got home from school
that morning on the worst day.</i>

128
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,021
Spaz!

129
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:54,801
<i>Because of what was going on,
they let us out of school early.</i>

130
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,668
<i>Again, that's the incident,
that's what we are hearing.</i>

131
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,207
This is terrible.

132
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,211
You're not supposed to smoke in the lobby.
You'll get in trouble.

133
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,682
There's no such thing as trouble today.
Where are your parents?

134
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,183
Is anybody downtown?

135
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,687
My mom's at work.
My dad's at a meeting somewhere.

136
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,121
Anyway, it's none of your business,
dip shiitake.

137
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,056
Eff you, Oskar.

138
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,696
Succotash my ball sack.

139
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,427
Oh, Gad.

140
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:48,719
Message one, September 11th, 8:56</i> a.m.

141
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,756
Are you there? Hello?

142
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,429
<i>If you're there, darling, pick up.</i>

143
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,865
<i>Ugh. I just tried the office,
but no one was picking up</i>

144
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,269
<i>Uh, listen, uh, something's happened.
I'm okay.</i>

145
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,104
<i>They're telling us to stay where we are
and wait for the fireman.</i>

146
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,379
<i>I'm sure it's fine.
I'll give you another call</i>

147
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,512
<i>when I have a better idea
of what's going on.</i>

148
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,844
<i>I wanted to let you know that I'm okay
and not to worry...</i>

149
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,715
<i>...and I'll call again soon.
All right, bye-bye.</i>

150
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,257
Message two, September 11th, 9:12 a.m

151
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,530
<i>Are you there? Are you there?
It's me again.</i>

152
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,191
<i>Hello?</i>

153
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,897
<i>I was hoping you would be home.
I don't know if you heard about what happened...</i>

154
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,042
<i>...but I wanted you to
know that I'm okay.</i>

155
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,202
<i>Everything is fine. We're still waiting
to find out what we're supposed to do.</i>

156
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,848
<i>It's pretty chaotic. Firemen
are supposed to be coming. What...</i>

157
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,793
<i>If the sun were to explode...</i>

158
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,123
<i>you wouldn't even know
about it for eight minutes...</i>

159
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,497
<i>...because that's how long it takes
for light to travel to us.</i>

160
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,698
<i>For eight minutes,
the world would still be bright...</i>

161
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,034
<i>...and it would still feel warm.</i>

162
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,577
<i>It was a year since my dad died...</i>

163
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,246
<i>...and I could feel
my eight minutes with him...</i>

164
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,822
<i>...were running out.</i>

165
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,326
<i>Democrats argued
that Estrada is too conservative...</i>

166
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,587
<i>...and not answering all
of their questions.</i>

167
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,358
<i>Estrada was first nominated
for the position in May, 2001.</i>

168
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,902
<i>The Bush administration has asked for a 4.2
percent increase in military spending...</i>

169
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,206
<i>...from 365 billion dollars
to 380 billion dollars.</i>

170
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,276
<i>That figure does not include...</i>

171
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,723
<i>I hadn't gone into
my dads closet since the worst day.</i>

172
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,108
<i>Mom hadn't touched his stuff.</i>

173
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>It was all there.</i>

174
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,268
Oskar! You okay?

175
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,415
This is Oskar Schell.

176
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,627
Grandma? Grandma, are you awake?

177
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,887
Over.

178
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,828
Grandma?

179
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,301
<i>It's Grandma. Uh, what is it, sweetheart?
Can't you sleep?</i>

180
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,338
<i>Do you want me to come over?</i> Over.

181
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,671
<i>Did Dad ever mention a special key
to you, Grandma?</i> Over.

182
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,313
<i>A special key?</i>

183
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,580
<i>I don't think so, no.
A special key? What for?</i>

184
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,113
<i>What was this special key for?</i>

185
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,310
Over.

186
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,585
Is the Renter home? Over.

187
00:16:55,748 --> 00:17:00,163
<i>The Renter? No, no,
he's never home this early. Over.</i>

188
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,731
<i>Grandma had rented a room to a man...</i>

189
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,799
<i>...three weeks after the worst day.</i>

190
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,899
Why is the Renter's dour always
closed? And why can I never meet him?

191
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,199
He likes quiet.

192
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,641
Why can't you tell me
anything about him?

193
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,906
He's someone I knew in the old country.
Now play.

194
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,246
Haw long will he be here?

195
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,981
He never stays any place for lung.

196
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,922
Is he dangerous?

197
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,457
If you ever see him, don't say anything.

198
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,663
He can get very angry. New play.

199
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,916
What have you found, Oskar?</i> Over.

200
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,486
<i>Oskar, are you still there?</i>

201
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,279
<i>Oskar?</i>

202
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,959
It's for some kind of lockbox

203
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,257
It's not like any of these.
It's thicker, harder to break.

204
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,533
But it's not for a fixed
safe, I don't think.

205
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,794
Could be a safe deposit box,
post office box.

206
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,803
It's old. Maybe 20, 30 years old.

207
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,943
Haw can I find the company
that made it?

208
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,305
Anyone could've made it

209
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,606
Then haw do I find the lack that it fits?

210
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,774
I'm afraid I can't help you there, unless you
wanna try it in anything you come across.

211
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,820
You never know what a key's gonna fit.
There are a million different possibilities.

212
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,490
That's what I love about keys.
They all open something.

213
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,625
Just one.

214
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,820
Shouldn't you be in school?

215
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,630
It's Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

216
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,628
<i>Lie number two</i>

217
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,668
<i>I started counting my lies earlier that
morning when I told Mom I had a fever.</i>

218
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,342
I don't wanna potentially infect
a multitude of people at school.

219
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,809
I could be a walking pathogen

220
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:01,178
I thought Martin Luther King's birthday
was in January.

221
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,346
It used to be. They changed it.

222
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,749
<i>That was lie number three.</i>

223
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,980
Hold an, Oskar.

224
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,049
Who's "Black"?
On the envelope?

225
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,353
Anybody you know?

226
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,592
Could be somebody who knows
something about the key.

227
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,895
Thanks for being
such a great locksmith.

228
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,903
What do you need these far?

229
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,502
A project an the census.

230
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,009
<i>Lie number four.</i>

231
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,509
Why aren't you in school?

232
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,510
- They said I know tan much already.
- Ah.

233
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,017
Black, Black, Black.

234
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,054
<i>Well, "Black" was definitely a person.
Probably.</i>

235
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,453
<i>If "Black" was a person, he or she
must have known Dad somehow.</i>

236
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,098
Faur-hundred-seventy-two.

237
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,760
<i>But how?
And how was I going to find him/her?</i>

238
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,129
<i>Was this a Reconnaissance
Expedition?</i>

239
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,967
Lagos, Nigeria. And it drifted...

240
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,140
<i>Dad's expeditions
always included a journey.</i>

241
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,644
...2278.3 nautical miles.

242
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,142
Brazil!

243
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,113
<i>And he always planned them,
down to the smallest details.</i>

244
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,548
Five miles an hour.

245
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,119
Seven hundred.

246
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,989
<i>What else could it be?</i>

247
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,356
<i>If there was a key,
there was a lock.</i>

248
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,761
<i>If there was a name,
there was a person.</i>

249
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,238
I'm home.

250
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,614
<i>There had to be a lock.</i>

251
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,986
<i>I would find it because
he wanted me to find it.</i>

252
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,786
Q-56. Q-56. Q-56.

253
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:56,189
<i>And I would find it because it was the only
way I could stretch my 8 minutes with him.</i>

254
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,128
<i>Maybe I could stretch them forever.</i>

255
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,680
<i>I put together a backpack of vita!
Things I would need for my survival.</i>

256
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,626
<i>An Israeli gas mask Grandma bought me
two weeks after the worst day.</i>

257
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,828
<i>My tambourine to help keep me calm.</i>

258
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,734
<i>Binoculars, obviously.</i>

259
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,697
<i>I had to travel light
to be as quick as possible.</i>

260
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,843
<i>My expedition journal.</i>

261
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,042
<i>My father's father's camera.</i>

262
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:53,485
A Brief History Of Time, <i>by</i> Stephen
Hawking, that my dad used to read to me.

263
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,689
<i>Cell phone.</i>

264
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,528
<i>Fig Newtons, which I love.</i>

265
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,701
<i>The key, obviously.</i>

266
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,905
<i>And my father's message
to not stop looking.</i>

267
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,100
<i>And I wouldn't, not</i> ever.

268
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,615
Hey.

269
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,959
Where you going?

270
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,897
Out.

271
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,222
Where?

272
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:40,561
I told you, to the <i>comic</i> book
convention with Minch. Be back later.

273
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,868
<i>Lie number five.
Except for the "be back later" part.</i>

274
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,842
Well, leave your cell phone on.
Check in with me every hour, okay?

275
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,470
I mean it.

276
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,086
<i>I didn't know what
was waiting for me.</i>

277
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,647
<i>Although my stomach hurt
and my eyes were watering...</i>

278
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:05,591
<i>...I made up my mind that nothing,
nothing was going to stop me.</i>

279
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,389
<i>Not even me.</i>

280
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,964
<i>First up, Abby Black,
Fort Greene, Brooklyn.</i>

281
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,606
<i>Because public transportation
makes me panicky, I walked.</i>

282
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,112
<i>I've always had a hard time
doing certain things.</i>

283
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,517
The elevator works, genius.

284
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,176
I know, retard.

285
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,187
<i>But the worst day
made the list of things a lot longer.</i>

286
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,123
- Old people...
- Ah!

287
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,490
<i>...Running people...</i>

288
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,056
...airplanes...

289
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,425
<i>...tall things...</i>

290
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,966
<i>...things you can get stuck in.</i>

291
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,665
<i>Loud things.</i>

292
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,364
<i>- Screaming, crying.
- Aah</i>!

293
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,871
<i>- People with bad teeth...</i>
- Ha-ha-ha!

294
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,535
<i>...Bags without owners, shoes without
owners, children without parents...</i>

295
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,648
<i>...ringing things, smoking things,
people eating meat...</i>

296
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,977
<i>...people looking up.</i>

297
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,584
<i>Towers, tunnels, speeding things...</i>

298
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,889
<i>...loud things, things with lights,
things with wings.</i>

299
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,324
<i>Bridges make me especially panicky.</i>

300
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,642
<i>- Come on, try.
- I can't try.</i>

301
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,316
<i>If you don't try, you'll never know.</i>

302
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,682
- So try.
- Don't be disappointed with me!

303
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,826
Come on. Take your juice

304
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,326
You know, Grandma brought me
to these swings.

305
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,027
My favorite...

306
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,134
...was one, two...

307
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,273
...the third from the right...

308
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,512
...because I thought it would go higher
than any other one.

309
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,810
So when everyone had gone home...

310
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:08,944
...I'd swing.

311
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,655
It was just me and the swings.

312
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,393
I'd do a lot of thinking up here,
especially when I learned how to pump

313
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,862
I would go as high as I could go...

314
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,266
...until I couldn't go any higher...

315
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,264
and then I would jump

316
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,042
Ah! And for a moment,
I would feel as free as a bird.

317
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,913
You should give it a whirl, Oskar.

318
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,450
It might change the way
you lack at things.

319
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,640
It's not safe.

320
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,815
You don't have to jump.

321
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,088
Can we go home now?

322
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,341
Fort Greene.

323
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,416
Fort Greene.

324
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,686
Fart Greene!

325
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,230
Fart Greene! Fart Greene!

326
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,892
Fart Greene! Fart Greene!

327
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,850
What are you doing?
- Hello. My name is Oskar Schell.

328
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,788
Did you know my father,
Thomas Schell?

329
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,189
- You are Abby Black?
- Uh, yeah.

330
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,056
I'm sure people
tell you this constantly...

331
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,635
...but if you lack under
"incredibly beautiful" in the dictionary...

332
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,465
...there's a picture of you.

333
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,766
Abby, I'm trying to say something here.

334
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,510
- What are you doing?
- Would it be okay if I came in?

335
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,071
- New is really not a good time.
- Why not?

336
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,613
I'm in the middle of something.

337
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,842
I'm going upstairs to get this dune.

338
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,077
- Me tan.
- And you can do whatever...

339
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,448
What kind of something?

340
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,052
- Is that any of your business?
- Is that a rhetorical question?

341
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,818
I had to get <i>in</i> there.

342
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,365
I'm extremely thirsty!

343
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,057
<i>Lie number</i> seven.

344
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,802
What do you want to drink?

345
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,167
Iced coffee with half-and-half, please.

346
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,741
You coming?

347
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,383
I love this.

348
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,282
- So did I.
- Haw much do you know about elephants?

349
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,790
Hardly anything.

350
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,518
I know quite a lot

351
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,685
Loxodonta Africana

352
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,765
There's this woman who spent
the past 10 years in the Conga...

353
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,493
...making recordings of elephant calls
to learn haw they communicate.

354
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,467
Abby! Where is everything?

355
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,240
This past year, she started to play them
back to the elephants.

356
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,102
What's fascinating
is that she played back...

357
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,769
...the call of a dead elephant to family
members, and they remembered.

358
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,514
They approached the Jeep,
the speaker.

359
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,579
I wander what they were feeling
when they heard those calls.

360
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,846
I don't know.

361
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,617
I'm walking out of here. I will
call you back in 15 minutes, all right?

362
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,953
Did they cry?

363
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,186
Only humans can cry tears,
did you know that?

364
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,130
Even the elephant
in the picture is crying.

365
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:25,469
It looks like it, but it was probably
manipulated in Photoshop.

366
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,471
Don't cry.

367
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,880
Hey, Bab, haw are you?
I'm great, I'm great.

368
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,214
How's the family? Awesome.

369
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,379
We're awesome, we're doing great.

370
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,050
So listen. Meet me at the office
at 3:00, okay?

371
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,356
- Who's that?
- My husband.

372
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,262
You must think this is very add.

373
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,665
Oh, I think a lot of things are odd

374
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,864
People tell me I'm very add all the time.

375
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,033
I gut tested once to see
if I had Asperger's disease.

376
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,379
Dad said it's for people who are smarter
than everybody else but can't run straight.

377
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,881
Tests weren't definitive.

378
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,015
Are you sure you didn't know him?
Thomas Schell?

379
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,855
He was in the building.

380
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,686
In 9/11.

381
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,392
I'm trying to find a lack for this key
that was in the envelope...

382
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,195
...that once belonged to my father.

383
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,702
I'm sorry, I don't know anything
about the key or your father.

384
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,278
Can I barrow that?

385
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,908
You're welcome to it.

386
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,810
I thought you really liked it

387
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,451
Lats of things will be different
around here.

388
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,222
Can I kiss you?

389
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:01,396
You're a sweet bay, but I don't think
that would be a good idea.

390
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,037
Can I take your picture
so I can remember you?

391
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,432
Haw was the <i>comic</i> convention?

392
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,970
Were you there the whale day?

393
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,011
Can you unlock the dour, please?

394
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,982
Oskar, can you open the dour, please?

395
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,780
Oskar?

396
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,356
Do you hear me, Oskar?
Let me in, please.

397
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,726
Oskar, please, let me in.

398
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,209
Why do you wanna came in?

399
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,376
Ta tell you that I love you.

400
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,052
Look, I was hoping you would be home.

401
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,423
<i>I don't know if you
heard about what happened...</i>

402
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,360
<i>...but I wanted you to know
I'm okay.</i>

403
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,229
<i>Everything is fine. We're still waiting
to find out what we're supposed to do.</i>

404
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,804
<i>It's pretty chaotic. Firemen are
supposed to be coming. What...</i>

405
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,975
Message three,
September <i>11th,</i> 9:58 a.m.

406
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,699
<i>Having survived
what is an extraordinary event...</i>

407
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,995
<i>...the collapse of two towers</i>

408
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,798
<i>As we said earlier in our report,
110 stories</i> each.

409
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,498
<i>I will tell you that what fell...</i>

410
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,801
Oskar?

411
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,945
Oskar!

412
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,940
Oskar?

413
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,852
Are you all right?

414
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,724
Yeah.

415
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,593
They let you out of school early.

416
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,067
Yeah.

417
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,330
Do you know what happened?

418
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,940
Yeah.

419
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,638
Your mother will be home scan.

420
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,149
You want to just wait here
until she comes?

421
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,683
I guess so.

422
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,158
Do you want me to wait here with you?

423
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,559
It's okay.

424
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,569
You're sure?

425
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,703
Positive.

426
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,941
You're sure?

427
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,606
Oskar. Oskar!

428
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,947
Oskar. Oskar!

429
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,493
Did your fa... Did your father call?

430
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,210
Are there any messages
an the machine?

431
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,444
Thank you.

432
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,461

<i>Sorry, due to heavy calling, we cannot

Mam, I don't know,
I've already told you everything I know.

442
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,004
Hospitals, the police,
and any number I can find.

443
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,343
I only missed one of the calls.

444
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,641
Na, I don't want you to came aver.

445
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,341
I don't want to make any of this any bigger
for Oskar than it already is.

446
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,181
Uh, I'll call you if I need you, okay?

447
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,260
Recording.

448
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,909
Hi, you've reached the Schell residence.
Today is Tuesday, September 11th.

449
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,336
Here's today's fact of the day:

450
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,572
It is so cold in Yakutia,
that breath instantly freezes...

451
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:37,652
...with a crackling sound they call
"the whispering of the stars".

452
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,853
Hi, you've reached the Schell resid...

453
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,795
<i>Now no one will
ever have to listen to them like I did.</i>

454
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,368
<i>Just like nothing ever happened.</i>

455
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,451
<i>Every time I left our apartment,
I became a little lighter...</i>

456
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,257
<i>...because I was getting
closer to Dad.</i>

457
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:29,031
<i>But I also got a little heavier,
because I was further from Mom.</i>

458
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,245
Why are you lacking at me like that?

459
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,518
- Like haw?
- Like I did something wrung.

460
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,494
- Do you have your cell phone?
- Right here.

461
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,702
I love you.

462
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,695
<i>Maybe she was waiting
there until I left.</i>

463
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,559
<i>Or maybe she'd already walked away.</i>

464
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,595
<i>Maybe she was just talking too quietly
for me to</i> hear.

465
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,922
<i>Hazelle Black
lived in Hamilton Heights.</i>

466
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,284
Gonna <i>worry</i> about

467
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,481
<i>Came an, came an.</i>

468
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:35,757
<i>If you know the Lord is keepin' you
Why don't you sing and shout?</i>

469
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,126
Hey!

470
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:44,133
Dear Gad, I just ask that
you would watch aver little Oskar...

471
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,102
...and I pray, ah, Gad,
for a miracle for him.

472
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:52,976
And that you keep him safe and in
your loving arms as he goes an his way.

473
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,946
Amen.

474
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:00,414
Remember, every day is a miracle.

475
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,654
I don't believe in miracles.

476
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,453
Finding what this key fits...

477
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,325
would be a miracle

478
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:18,137
<i>I started with
a key with no lock</i>

479
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,707
<i>And I designed a system
I thought fit the problem.</i>

480
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,477
<i>I broke everything down
into the smallest parts...</i>

481
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:32,216
<i>...and tried to think of each person
as a number in a gigantic equation.</i>

482
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,887
It could be for a safe deposit box
or a lockbox.

483
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,822
It's old. Can I try it to see
if it fits something?

484
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,800
<i>But it wasn't working.</i>

485
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,236
<i>Because people aren't like numbers.
They're more like letters.</i>

486
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,809
<i>And those letters
want to become stories.</i>

487
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,643
<i>And Dad said that stories
need to be shared.</i>

488
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,821
That's it, leg, leg, leg, leg!

489
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,825
<i>I had anticipated a six-minute visit
with each person named Black...</i>

490
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,427
...but they were never just six minutes.

491
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,368
<i>Everyone took more time
than I had planned for...</i>

492
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,412
<i>...to try and comfort me
and make me feel better about my dad.</i>

493
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,585
<i>And to tell me their stories.</i>

494
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:51,427
<i>But I didn't want to feel better
and I didn't want friends.</i>

495
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,259
Tae Kwon Do, museum,
comic back convention.

496
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,269
<i>I just wanted the lock.</i>

497
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,941
Paint two five divided by 65...

498
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,805
...156 days divided by 52
equals three years.

499
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,879
<i>I wasn't getting any
closer to my dad.</i>

500
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,615
<i>I was losing him.</i>

501
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,976
<i>What are you, some kind of asshole?</i>

502
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,746
Dickass!

503
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:19,119
Shiitake! All of you
in this stupid fukozowa building!

504
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:29,431
<i>It must be a very confusing day.</i>

505
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,631
<i>I'll call you right back.</i>

506
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,135
Message four, Septem...

507
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,456
Oskar, what's wrung?

508
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,063
Do you promise not to bury me
when I die?

509
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,393
It's the middle of the night, Oskar.

510
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,557
Do you promise not to bury me
when I die?

511
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,333
You are not going to die.

512
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:09,537
You are going to live a lung, long life.

513
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,577
You sure you love me?

514
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,014
Completely sure.

515
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,219
Then put me in one of those
mausoleum thingies above the ground.

516
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,059
Oh.

517
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,526
Okay, we need to talk.

518
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,497
About my mausoleum?

519
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,633
Na.

520
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,670
About what's been going an.

521
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,167
Why do you find it so hard
to talk to me?

522
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,379
In case you haven't noticed,
half the time, you're asleep.

523
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,041
And the other half the time,
you forget the first half.

524
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,916
You're what they call in the law
"in abstentia". An absent parent.

525
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,216
- That was mean.
- Which part?

526
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,851
All of it.

527
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,256
Dad used to say,
"The truth will set you free."

528
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,728
Well, Dad's not here.

529
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,800
- It's just the two of us.
- More like one and a quarter of us...

530
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:10,268
- ...to be mathematically accurate.
- Don't walk out of this roam, Oskar!

531
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,271
- What if I die tomorrow?
- You're not going to die tomorrow.

532
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,603
Dad didn't think he was
gonna die tomorrow either.

533
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:19,043
- It's not gonna happen to you.
- How do you know what's going to happen?

534
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,205
You know nothing.
You buried an empty box!

535
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,749
That's not the paint!
His memory is there!

536
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,946
It's exactly the point. Dad was just cells.
Now they're on rooftops, and the rivers...

537
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,181
Oskar!

538
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,452
...And the lungs of millions of people
who breathe him every time they breathe!

539
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,187
- That's not haw it works!
- Haw do you know haw it works?

540
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,628
You don't know anything
about atoms or molecules.

541
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,166
He might even be part of the
dag shit in Central Park!

542
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,769
That is enough. Stop it.

543
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,302
Excuse me, dag feces.

544
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,167
- Stop it!
- But it's the truth!

545
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,310
Why can't I say the truth? Just because
Dad died doesn't mean you can be illogical.

546
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,742
- It has to make sense!
- Nat everything makes sense, Oskar!

547
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,609
There's not an answer for everything!

548
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,842
You're just stupid!
It's completely nonsensical!

549
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,520
It's just a box! An empty box!

550
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,680
I know it's an empty box! I know this.

551
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:06,988
But I did it for me, and I did it for you
so we could at least try...

552
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,959
...and say goodbye to him...

553
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:13,663
...because he's gone, Oskar,
he's gone and he's not coming back.

554
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:14,996
Never.

555
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,162
I don't know why a man flew a plane
into a building.

556
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,002
I don't know why my husband is dead.

557
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,304
But no matter haw you try, Oskar,
it's never gonna make sense...

558
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,439
...because it doesn't,
it doesn't make sense!

559
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,643
Fukozowa you!
You don't know anything!

560
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,410
Why did you lie to me?

561
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,848
What are you talking about?

562
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,751
Where were you?

563
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,044
Where was I when?

564
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,548
That day, the worst day.

565
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,848
You know I was at work.

566
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,253
There was no one here.

567
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,295
I wish I had been.

568
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,234
But it wasn't possible.

569
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,597
You should've made it possible!

570
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:26,297
I can't make the impossible possible.

571
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,639
I wish it were you.

572
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,614
I wish it were you in the building
instead of him.

573
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,388
So do I.

574
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,244
I didn't really mean that.

575
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:12,747
Yes, you did.

576
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,796
Ga back to bed.

577
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,296
- Hey.
<i>- Linda?</i>

578
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,265
Yeah, I've been trying to reach you.
I'm an my way home. I'm coming home.

579
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,768
Thomas, can you hear me?

580
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,803
<i>Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

581
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,167
Ugh, this is unbelievable.
Are you watching this?

582
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,777
<i>Listen to me, other people want to use the
phone, so I don't have too much time.</i>

583
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,278
Listen to me, I'm gonna be home
in about 20 minutes.

584
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,883
<i>No, you listen to me.
I'm in the World Trade Center.</i>

585
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,316
What do you... What do you mean,
you're in the World Trade Center?

586
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,581
<i>I had a meeting.
But I'm gonna be okay.</i>

587
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,124
<i>They're telling us to stay where we are.
We broke a window to let in some air.</i>

588
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,317
Where are you?

589
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,827
<i>I'm on the 106th? oor.
There's about 50 of us up here.</i>

590
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,134
You... You listen to me,
you come home right now

591
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,635
<i>It's gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

592
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,596
<i>- No..
- Where is Oskar?</i>

593
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,904
Oskar's an his way home, but you listen
to me, you came home right now.

594
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:47,572
<i>I will.
I will call and I will tell him.</i>

595
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,444
Tell him what?

596
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,349
<i>I'll... I'll tell him,
ahem, what's happening.</i>

597
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,753
<i>I'll tell him what's happening.
We've been told to wait where we are.</i>

598
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:01,658
<i>The firemen are on their way.
And we're all fine. We've been told to wait.</i>

599
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:02,956
Thomas?

600
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,464
- That's what we got to do.
- Thomas...

601
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,657
<i>Okay?</i>

602
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,769
Na, it's not okay. Listen to me.

603
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,233
- Yeah.
- Thomas.

604
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,896
You need to listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.

605
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,304
You need to find a stairwell.
Do you hear me?

606
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,878
- Yes.
- Find the stairs and you came home.

607
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:24,185
<i>Linda, honey, I've gotta go.
Other people need to use the phone.</i>

608
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,617
<i>I'm gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

609
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,847
Stop saying that. Just find the stairs.

610
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,016
<i>Linda, listen to me.
You do everything to make my life better.</i>

611
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,856
<i>I want you to know that
I absolutely love you.</i>

612
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,022
<i>I absolutely love you</i>

613
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,799
Don't stop talking to me.
Just stay talking to me.

614
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,564
<i>I'm gonna try to call you again
in a few min...</i>

615
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,299
Please, just stay talking to me...

616
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:55,005
<i>This is unconfirmed,
but we are getting information...</i>

617
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,674
<i>...from an employee
of United Airlines.</i>

618
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,811
<i>Again, we want to emphasize this is
unconfirmed, but there is speculation...</i>

619
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,123
Grandma, are you awake?

620
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,250
Over.

621
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:48,069
Grandma, please wake up. Over.

622
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,635
Please.

623
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,439
Over.

624
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,425
Grandma?

625
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,116
I know someone is in there.

626
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:22,153
I won't hurt you. I'm only 4 years old.

627
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,663
<i>Lie number 64.</i>

628
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,002
Who are you?

629
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:51,015
I'm Oskar Schell, Grandma's grandson.
Do you know where my grandma is?

630
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,195
Out this time of night?

631
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,527
Do you know where?
It's kind of a matter of life and death.

632
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,476
Are you a stranger?

633
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,410
Technically?

634
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,647
I wouldn't go into a stranger's bedroom.

635
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,909
Haw came you don't speak?

636
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,773
Are your vocal cards
damaged or something?

637
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,772
Or did something scare you to death?

638
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,380
Coal.

639
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,021
When was the last time you spake?

640
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,524
Do you ever try to talk?

641
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,457
Why don't you try to say
something to me?

642
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,295
Ga an.

643
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:11,129
"My name is the Renter."

644
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,798
Do you have a criminal record?

645
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,738
Mm. Maybe you hurt people for a living?

646
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,684
Well, what's your story then?

647
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:43,596
<i>I had to tell someone.
I couldn't keep it a secret any more.</i>

648
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,535
Can I tell you my story?

649
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,307
My father died at 9/11.

650
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,275
After he died, I wouldn't go
into his roam for a year...

651
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:59,352
...because it was tan hard
and it always made me wanna cry.

652
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:03,480
<i>But one day, I had completely heavy
boots and I went into his room anyway.</i>

653
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,986
I miss doing Tae Kwon Do with him
because it made me laugh.

654
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,330
When <i>I</i> went into <i>his</i> closet
where <i>his</i> clothes and stuff were...

655
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,263
...I reached up to get his old camera
with the brawn case...

656
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:15,130
<i>-and I broke a blue</i> vase.

657
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,601
<i>Inside was an envelope
with "Black" written on it.</i>

658
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,262
And I knew that Dad had left something...

659
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,000
...somewhere for me
that the key opened and I had to find

660
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,645
<i>So I take it to Walt the locksmith-
- I get from Stan the doorman...</i>

661
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,280
Some kind of lockbox

662
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,741
<i>-for all the five boroughs.</i>

663
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,714
I count there are 472 people
with the last name "Black."

664
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:34,549
There are 215 different addresses.
Some of the Blacks live together, obviously.

665
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,385
I calculate if I go to two
every Saturday plus holidays...

666
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,960
...minus my Hamlet school play rehearsals,
it'll take me about three years...

667
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,792
...ta go through all of them. But that's what I'll do.
Ga to every person named Black...

668
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,264
...and find out what the key fits
and what Dad needed me to find.

669
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,834
<i>The very best possible plan.</i>

670
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,502
I divided the people by zones and
I really had to tell my mother another lie.

671
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,473
She wouldn't understand
haw I need to find what the key fit...

672
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,704
...that would help me
make sense of things...

673
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,940
...like him being killed by people
who didn't even know him at all!

674
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,381
<i>And I see some people
who don't speak English...</i>

675
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,112
Hazelle Black, who's all prayered up
and spake to Gad.

676
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,348
<i>If she spoke to God, how come she
didn't tell him not to kill her</i> son...

677
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,185
...not to let people
fly planes into buildings

678
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,951
Maybe she spake to a different Gad
than them!

679
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,687
<i>I meet a man, who is a woman who
is a man, a woman all at the same time</i>

680
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,025
I didn't wanna get near him/her,
because she/he scared me...

681
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,461
...because she/he was so different.

682
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:22,603
I still wandered if she had a VJ
or penicillin, but what does it matter?

683
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,831
What would this place be like
if everybody had the same haircut?

684
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,475
I see Mr. Black, who hasn't heard
a sound in 24 years.

685
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,202
Which I can understand,
because I miss Dad's voice that much.

686
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,074
<i>Like when he would say
"Are you up yet?" or...</i>

687
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,579
Let's go do something.

688
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,307
<i>I see the twin brothers
who paint together.</i>

689
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:40,045
And there's a shed that just has
to be a clue, but it's just a shed!

690
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:41,950
<i>And Astrid Black,
who has the same drawing...</i>

691
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,455
...of the same person
over and over and over again!

692
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:47,185
<i>Boris Black, the doorman, who was once
a schoolteacher in Russia...</i>

693
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,388
<i>...but now says his brain is dying.
Ramos Black, who has a coin collection...</i>

694
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,430
...but doesn't have enough money
to eat every day!

695
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,593
<i>Alan Black has a view of Gramercy Park
but not a key to</i> it...

696
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,795
<i>...which he says is worse
than looking at a brick wall.</i>

697
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,565
I feel like I'm looking
at a brick wall...

698
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,073
...because I tried the key
in 148 different places...

699
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,235
...but the key didn't fit
and open anything Dad needed me to find.

700
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,574
So that I'd know without him
everything is all right.

701
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:08,807
Then let's leave it there.

702
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,849
I still feel scared every time
I go into a strange place.

703
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,250
I'm so scared I have to hold myself around
my waist or I think I'll just break apart!

704
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,186
But I never forget what I heard him
tell Mam about the Sixth Borough:

705
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,849
That if <i>things</i> were easy to find...

706
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,619
They wouldn't be worth finding.

707
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,525
<i>But I'm still scared every time I leave
home, every time I hear a door open.</i>

708
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,633
And I don't know a single thing
that I didn't know when I started...

709
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,791
...except <i>I miss</i> my dad
more than ever...

710
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,632
...even though the whale paint
was to stop missing him at all!

711
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,248
It hurts tan much.

712
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:44,175
Sometimes I think I might do
something really bad.

713
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,649
Like you to what?

714
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,421
<i>No way. Absolutely not. No, no, no.</i>

715
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,822
Sure. Next Saturday, <i>1</i> a.m.

716
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:10,131
<i>I got there 23 minutes,
37 seconds early just in</i> case.

717
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,247
<i>I didn't know if I
wanted him to be there.</i>

718
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,383
<i>I didn't even know
if! didn't want him to be there.</i>

719
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,982
<i>I'd give it the day to find out.</i>

720
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,232
If you're coming with me,
there are rules.

721
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:46,100
You are allotted two bathroom breaks,
one 19-minute stop for eating.

722
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,208
And sightseeing is strictly prohibited...

723
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,435
although sites of historical merit
may be noted.

724
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,815
Also, there's a list of 15 simple questions
about yourself I'd like you to answer.

725
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,312
Came an.

726
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:10,927
Rule number four is keep up.
I can't stop and wait every two minutes.

727
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:28,880
Jean Black is in Zane H,
map grid AQ-16.

728
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:33,077
It's in the Rockaways, 11.3 miles
This way.

729
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,158
I don't take the train. It's not safe.

730
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,131
It's an obvious target.
All public transportation is.

731
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,101
You can get blown to pieces
by people who don't even know you.

732
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,438
Oh, nu.

733
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,981
<i>He said: "I can't walk that far."</i>

734
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:10,056
<i>He said if I wanted him to go with me, it
would have to be on the bus or a train.</i>

735
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,057
<i>- And the train was a lot faster.</i>

736
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,759
<i>- Anyway, there's nothing to be.</i>

737
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,557
It's easy for you to say!

738
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,725
<i>Which actually... it wasn't.</i>

739
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:10,478
"Think about nothing."
That's an oxymoron, like, "now, then."

740
01:05:10,638 --> 01:05:14,381
<i>An oxymoron is when two words
contradict each other.</i>

741
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:17,655
<i>My father and I used to have
oxymoron wars.</i>
