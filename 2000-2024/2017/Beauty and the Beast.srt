00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,320
Monggo mirsani

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,310
At one time, Deep in the
country of France...

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,490
There lived a handsome prince, who
lived in magnificent palaces.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,300
Though he had
everything he wanted...

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,230
Prince was cruel and selfish.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,500
Sir, it's time.

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,410
He imposes high taxes on the people to
fill the castle with beautiful things.

8
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,380
We did it.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,380
And party with great people.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,410
On one night there was an intruder
who arrived at the castle.

11
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,390
He sought refuge from the storm.

12
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,320
As a reward he offers
a rose to the Prince.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,230
Disgusted by the poor performances
jeered her prince gift,

14
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,430
Then, the woman warned her to
not be fooled by appearances...

15
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,310
Because of the beauty,
indeed there is in him.

16
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,460
And, when she drove back, old
woman transform herself...

17
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,360
be beautiful and
fascinating woman.

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,240
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late...

19
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,340
because he had seen no
love within the prince.

20
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,520
As punishment, he changed the
prince into a horrible creature...

21
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,330
and left a curse on the palace,
and all who live in it.

22
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,240
Day turned into years, the prince and
his servant have been forgotten.

23
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,370
Magicians keep them
remember loved ones,

24
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,280
but the roses he
had a magic roses.

25
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,480
lf he can learn to love each
other and love unrequited,

26
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,450
when the last leaf falls then,
the curse will disappear

27
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,330
lf not, he will be damned
as bad beast forever.

28
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,270
Years passed He fell into
despair and loss of hope...

29
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,300
waiting to see who will learn
to love the horrible creature?

30
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,490
Small town

31
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,300
Quiet village

32
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,340
Every day like any other day

33
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,290
The small town Full
of little people

34
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,290
Waking up to say:

35
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,290
Bonjour! Bonjour!

36
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,240

Good morning, Monsieur!

42
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,350
Did you lose something else?

43
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,480
Looks like.

44
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,340
The problem is l can not
remember what it was.

45
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,320
l'm sure it will
come back to me.

46
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,320
- Where are you going?
- Go to the bookstore.

47
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,430
lt was about two lovers.

48
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,460
Sound boring.

49
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,400
strange girl, no doubt

50
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,430
always confused

51
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,470
Never in keramainan Because the
head was covered with clouds

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,410
No doubt, this girl Belle

53
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,250

There must be a better
life than this place

59
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,340
Look at the only nerd in town.

60
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,270
You're where?

61
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,240
2 cities in the North.

62
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,430
l do not want to go back.

63
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,450
- Have you got a new one?
- l'm afraid there is not.

64
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,280
but you may have read.

65
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,480
thanks.

66
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,390
Your library makes it so great.

67
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,480
OK.

68
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,310
Bye.

69
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,260
Look at this girl she
is surely strange

70
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,390
l doubt if he's healthy

71
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,230
His nose is always a dreamy
way, stuck facing book

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,370
For us it was a girls 'Belle'

73
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,400
ls not this awesome

74
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,370
This is my favorite part

75
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,390
Because you'll know

76
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,490
This, when he met
the handsome prince

77
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,490
but he would not meet him

78
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,220
Until part three

79
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,310
There's no doubt why the
name of the 'Beauty'

80
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,310
There is no iota of similarity

81
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,350
Behind the face of
reasonable Kuyakin him odd

82
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,470
Very different from us all

83
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,350
He does not like us.

84
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,410
He's different with
us all the 'Belle'

85
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,300
Look at him.

86
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,420
My future wife.

87
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,460
Belle is the prettiest
girl in the village.

88
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,530
- That makes her the best.
- But he is predictable.

89
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,330
You're very athletic.

90
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,250
- l know. She is beautiful.
- Yes. You got us.

91
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,250
Yes, since the war
l lost something.

92
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,320
He's the only one who
gave me the spark.

93
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,390
l dont know the meaning.

94
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,390

Stay tuned .. my heart, l

102
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,230
He was tall, sinister,
handsome and ruthless

103
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,400
That will never happen, ladies.

104
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,240

There must be a better
life than this place

See, l will make 'Belle' wife

115
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,270
Look at him, a strange
but special girl

116
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,500
She was the girl who most insane

117
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
He is disabled and the
poor, he does not fit here

118
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,260
Good morning, Belle.

119
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,520
What book is it?

120
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,490
Have you read it?

121
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,260
Not that it was but a book.
For your dinner table.

122
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,240
Tonight?

123
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,340
Sorry, not tonight.

124
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,400
- ls it true? - No.

125
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:26,280
- So get on with life? - The selling
expensive to make the sweetest prey.

126
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,320
lt makes Belle very tempting.

127
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,330
What is the name?

128
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,450
Pride.

129
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,260
That is interesting.

130
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,490
How moment lasts forever?

131
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,230
How can a story never dies?

132
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,340
We must hold on love

133
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,470
Not easy, but we try

134
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,240
Sometimes we get
caught happiness

135
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,390
Somehow, place and
time stood still

136
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:43,420
Love lives in our
hearts and will always

137
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,530
Belle, can you give me...

138
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,310

140
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,280
No.

141
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,250
Actually this.

142
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,290
- You think it's a little weird?
- Strange?

143
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,360
Daughter's strange. Where
did you have the idea?

144
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,430
People are talking.

145
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,370
This small village.
Small mind also.

146
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,380
But smaller also means secure.

147
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,220
Even back in Paris a girl
like you is very great.

148
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,230
You're different.

149
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,260
People mocked him.

150
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,360
Until they imitate.

151
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,380
Please tell one
another about it.

152
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,210
Your mother without fear.

153
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,320
Without fear.

154
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,230
So what can l bring
to the market?

155
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,310
Rose. As in painting.

156
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,440
- You asked every year.
-And every year you bring him.

157
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,410

158
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,380

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,320
- Bye, Dad. - Bye, honey.

160
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,450
Come on, Phillip.

- You know the way.
- See you tomorrow.

162
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,330
Good. Tomorrow with roses.

163
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,410
Take care of yourself.

164
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,380
What is he doing?

165
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,320
Laundry.

166
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,410
Come on, come on.

167
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,390
Blue Bird

168
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,500
that fly away.

169
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,430
- lt was incredible.
- What are you doing?

170
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,330
Teach a woman to read.

171
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,280
ls that not enough?

172
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,370
We have to do something.

173
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,360
You're incredible
creatures ever seen.

174
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,400
Nobody had ever seen.

175
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,440
But at least l know.

176
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,430
May l remind you about the time?

177
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,510
- What is wrong?
- There are women who need help.

178
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,470
Time to be a hero.

179
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
l'm not done with you.

180
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,340
l also.

181
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,250
Belle, l heard you had a problem
with the school principal.

182
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,330
May l give you a little advice?

183
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:17,230
- Do not ever trust him.
- What l want is to teach children to read.

184
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,310
The only children who should
you care about is yourself.

185
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,380
Yourself.

186
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,310
- l'm not ready to have children.
- Maybe you have not met the right guy.

187
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,350
No, Gaston. l've met them all.

188
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,250
Maybe you should
take another look.

189
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,490
- Some of us changed.
- Gaston, we will never be happy.

190
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,360
- Nobody can change that much.
- Oh, Belle.

191
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,340
You know what happens
when his father died?

192
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,360
They beg.

193
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,380
This is our world, Belle.

194
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,410
People like us are not
going to be better.

195
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,420
l may be a simple girl,

196
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,480
l'm not simple

197
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,420
l'm not going to marry Gaston.
Forgive me.

198
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:35,310
Can you imagine me to
be the man's wife bore

199
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,410
Mrs. Gaston

200
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,450
Can you see it?

201
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,450
Mrs. Gaston

202
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,250
his wife

203
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,350
No, sir! Not me!

And for once it might be great

209
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,360
Having someone who understands

210
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:31,460
l wanted it than they want

211
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,280
Very beautiful. l wish l
could have known you.

212
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,350
You know we are where?
Because l do not know.

213
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,260
All right, all right, Phillip.

214
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,310
We can pass here.

215
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,430
Come on. To the right.

216
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,240
There he is.

217
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,310
One road was closed,
others open.

218
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,410
OK.

219
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,480
Slowly.

220
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,490

Phillip!

224
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,390
Come on, kid!

225
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,240
Oh, Phillip you saved my life.

226
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,370
Nice.

227
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,480
They eat dinner elsewhere.

228
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,290

229
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,290

seeking shelter from the storm.

239
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,490
Sorry to bother you.

240
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,510
There are people at home?

241
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,470
He must get lost in the woods.

242
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,420
Excuse me.

243
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,320

Oops.

247
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,350
Wherever you're hiding

248
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,300
l just want to warm
themselves in the fireplace.

249
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,410
Much better.

250
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,340
Much better.

251
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,350
thanks.

252
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,330
l should not be moved
because it was creepy.

253
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,310
Sorry.

254
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,350
lt is okay.

Come on. Go.

258
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,270
Wait! Wait.

259
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,250
You forget the roses.

260
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,250
Are here?

261
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,390
There is a rose.

262
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,480
This.

263
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,220
Where is Papa?

264
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,450
Take me to him.

265
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,500
See. Beautiful girl.

266
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,250
Yes, l could see the girl.

267
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,350
- Except for the hands and eyes.
- Maybe he can break the curse.

268
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,420
Who's talking?

269
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,290
Who is there?

270
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,330
Papa, is that you?

271
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,500
How did you find me?

272
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,270
Your hands are cold.

273
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,380
We need to go home.

274
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,400
He lives.

275
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,510
Now go before he found you!

276
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,410
Who?

277
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,280
Who is there?

278
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,420
Who are you?!

279
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,290
Who are you?

280
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,390
l came to pick up my father.

281
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,260
Your father is a thief.

282
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,400
Liar!

283
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,270
- He stole a rose.
- l asked her roses.

284
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,210
Law l'm not him.

285
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,510
No. That forever.

286
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,280
That's what happened here
when you pick flowers.

287
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,520
A life sentence for the roses?

288
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,360
l received the curse
of a lifetime.

289
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,500
- Now you still want to replace your father?
- Yes.

290
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:23,310
- Select - l will not let you do it. l
lost my mother is not with you, too.

291
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,290
Now go away.

292
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,490
All right, Dad, l'm gone.

293
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,300
l need more time with him.

294
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,310
You're so coldhearted. You
did not let me say goodbye.

295
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,280
Give it time.

296
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,390
lf it is closed, it
will not open again.

297
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,210
- l should be with. - No.

298
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,310
lt is okay.

299
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,420
Now go away.

300
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,480
Continue your life
and forget me.

301
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,460

302
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,290

Do not be afraid.

And l'm going to run
away, l promise.

306
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,430
What? What?

307
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,410
You take his place.

308
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,310
- He's my father.
- He was stupid.

309
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,450
And you, too.

310
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,350
Belle.

311
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,290
Father! Do not hurt him!

312
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,330
- Dad! - Belle.

313
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,520
Belle! l will be back!

314
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,430

315
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,250
Sorry l disturb, Miss.

But l have come to escort
you to your room a new one.

317
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,320
My room?

318
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,430
- But l thought...
- Oh, what? Words...

319
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,260
''Once the door is closed,
it will not open again.''

320
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,420
l know he's overrated.

321
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,400
Hello.

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,310
Oh, you're very strong.

- You can talk.
- Of course he can talk.

326
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,320
That's all he did.

327
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,410
Now, Lumiere. As head
of the furniture,

328
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,480
l ask you to immediately
prepare the food.

329
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,460
You want to be for the rest of your
life, Cogsworth? Humans, or hours?

330
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,300
Ready, Miss? Trust me.

331
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,330

332
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,470

lt's French. Lumiere ready to
serve, the palace is now yours.

334
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,310
- So you can be anywhere.
- Except to the west wing.

335
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,410
And we did not have it.

336
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,480
Why? What was in the West Wing?

337
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,480
- Oh, nothing. - There is no.

338
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,290
- Warehouse. - Warehouse.

339
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,290
- That is all. - That is all.

340
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,490
Yes, that's it. Please pass
here to go to the east wing.

341
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,490
And l want to say,
only one wing.

342
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,300
Carefully step.

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,230
Welcome to your room a new one.
lt's simple, but comfortable.

lt's beautiful.

345
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,260
But of course, the hosts want you
to get the best room in the palace.

346
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,460
Gosh, we're waiting for guests.

347
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,370
Nice to meet you, Miss.

348
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,240
Do not worry, l'll clean
up this place quickly.

349
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,440
Dangerous plan.

350
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,420

you again, Plumette.

351
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,320

- How can l be strong,

353
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,290
when you made me very weak.

354
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,430
Everything here alive?

355
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,390
Hello. What is your name?

356
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,460
lt was only a hairbrush.

357
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,440
Do not be afraid.
lt's just a closet.

358
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,270

Good eyes. The
face of the proud.

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,400
Now, let's see what l
have in my drawer.

368
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,310
Embarrassing.

369
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,380
Froufrou, help the mother.

370
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,320
Good, l like it. Dah.

371
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,390
Froufrou, send my
love to the Maestro.

372
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,490
lmagine LeFou. Comfortable home.

373
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,360
Hurry last roasted in the fire.

374
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,410
Our children are running
around, while my wife...

375
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,380
Massaging my feet were tired.
Said Belle...

376
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,310
''l'll never marry you, Gaston.''

377
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,370
You know, there are other girls.

378
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,320
Great hunter does not spend
his time with the rabbits.

379
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,310
# Gosh, l was disturbed
to see you, Gaston #

380
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,450
# lt looks very sad #

381
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,350
#All the men here want
to be like you, Gaston! #

382
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,490
# Even to receive pukulanmu #

383
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,240
# There are no men in this
town are wonderful as you #

384
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,260
#You're like everyone #

385
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,430
# Everyone was amazed
and inspired by you #

386
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,250
#And it is not
difficult to know why #

387
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:39,290
# No one is as smart as Gaston #

388
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:44,360
# Nobody soon as gaston ## There's
nothing as strong neck Gaston #

389
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,300
# Nobody dashing in this city #

390
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,390
#A perfect example #

391
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,240
#You can ask Tom,
Dick, or Stanley #

392
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:00,410
#And they'll tell you they
prefer parties where #

393
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,380
#Who is playing... #

394
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,250
Archery as Gaston ###Who
played a heart like Gaston #

395
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,450
#Who is part of his
body like Gaston? #

396
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,490
#As a person, yes,
l'm intimidating! #

397
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,490
# Gaston great guy! #

398
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,260
# l need consolation... #

399
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:29,270
# Thanks LeFou ## Nothing
is embraced like #

400
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,340
- Exaggerating? - Yes.

401
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,280
# Nobody fights like Gaston #

402
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,250
# Turn off the wax like Gaston #

403
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,420
ln wrestling nobody
bites like Gaston #

404
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,450
#When l hunt l slipped
with my arrow #

405
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,450
#And all the animals fear #

406
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,460
# First, l shoot her ##
Then l shot from behind #

407
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,440
# lt is fair ## l do not care #

408
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,500
# Nobody hit like Gaston ##
Nothing is as smart as Gaston #

409
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,340
# ln a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston #

410
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,440
# l'm very good at spitting #

411
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,320
- # 10 points for Gaston! #
- Thank you.

412
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,290
#When l was young l

413
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,420
# S3tiap morning to help large #

414

#And now that l'm big l

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:37,430
# So l'm at the ship #

416
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,400

00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:43,230
# Gaston! #

430
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,440
LeFou Oh, you're the best.

431
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,410
Why is not there a girl
who is close to you?

432
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,510
They told me that l was so dependent.
But l do not understand.

433
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,390
Please!

434
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,520
Komohon, anyone. Anyone.

435
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,320
- You have to help me. - Why?

436
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,300
You have to help me.
lt's about Belle.

437
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,270
lt's about Belle. He was jailed.

438
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,270
- Who is detained?
- Ugly creature.

439
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,390
Ugly horrible creatures great.

440
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,240
My daughter lives in danger,
why are you laughing?

441
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,440
This is not ajoke.

442
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,210
The palace was
hidden in the woods.

443
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,420
- There have been winter.
- Winter in June?

444
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,410
- Crazy old Maurice.
- Listen to me!

445
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,320
Ugly creature really exists.

446
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,290
You understand?

447
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,440
No one wants to help me?

448
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,430
l will help you, Maurice.

449
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,410
You want?

450
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,440
All.

451
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,270
Stop mocking this man.

452
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,410
Thank you, Captain.

453
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,380
Do not thank me, Maurice.

454
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,310
Show us the way to being ugly.

455
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,320
Come on.

456
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,490
- Mom, there's a girl in the palace.
- Yes, Chip.

457
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,260
- You already know.
- He likes what tea?

458
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,400
Herbal, oolong, camomile.

459
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,500
- l'm too excited. - Stop.

460
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,510
- lt will break your hand.
-Already, Ny. Potts.

461
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,530
- Lumiere!
- Calm down, let me do the talking.

462
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,260
- You make him dinner.
- We thought you wanted company.

463
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,470
Sir, l want to tell you,
if l had nothing to do in

464
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,310
prepare dinner.

465
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,340
Designing a dress for her, gave
him a room in the east wing.

466
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,510
- You gave him the room? - No.

467
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,250
- He gave him room. - Correct.

468
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,280
But this girl who can
break the spell,

469
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,310
and perhaps you could start by using
the dinner to make him fascinated.

470
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,350
- Good thinking, Cogsworth.
- What?

471
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,420
That's the most ridiculous
idea l've ever heard.

472
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,430
- Make fascinated prisoners.
- But you have to try, sir.

473
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,470
With each day that
passes, we are changing.

474
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,400
He's a thief.

475
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:36,310
- Do you think it has to what?
- You can not judge people

476
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,470
by their father, right?

477
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,340
You're going to have dinner with me.
lt was not a request.

478
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,290
Gently, sir. The
girl lost her father

479
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,380
and freedom in one day.

480
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,390
Yes, maybe now she was
frightened once inside.

481
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,290
Correct.

482
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,460
- Hold on. - See? There he is.

483
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,340
Now, remember. Gentle.

484
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,270
- Kind-hearted. - Enchanting.

485
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,300
-And sweet.
-And when he opened the door,

486
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,440
give him a smile.

487
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,480
Come on, show me that smile.

488
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,380
Forget it.

489
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,280
You want to have dinner with me?

490
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,260
You're holding me, and now you
want to have dinner with me?

491
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,490
- You are crazy? - He is angry.

492
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,300
Gosh.

493
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:40,300
- l told you to have dinner with me!
-And l say no!

494
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,300
Gosh, what time? What happened?

495
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,440
l'd better starve
than l eat with you.

496
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,340
Please! Up to you!

497
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,220
lf he does not eat with
me, so he did not eat!

498
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,290
Stupid!

499
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,320
He's gone?

500
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,420
l'm late? Unfortunately, this time
l'm really going to scold him.

501
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,470
- Sir, you're back. - What?

502
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,460
- You're so funny. - Gotcha.

503
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,290
Show me the girl.

504
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,320
- One more petals fall.
- Lumiere.

505
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,420
l grow three feathers again. And
l just pull it out yesterday.

506
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,450
l know, dear.

507
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,390
Every day l was
getting into metal.

508
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,460
Oh no. lt happened again.

509
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,470
- Sorry. - Everything is quiet.

510
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,500
We still have time.

511
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,340
Mother, what l'm going
to be a child again?

512
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,440
Yes, Chip. You will enjoy
a day in the sun again.

513
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,450
Leave it to me.

514
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,480
- l told you to go.
- Do not worry dear.

515
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,500
lt Ny. Potts.

516
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,510
Oh, you look beautiful.

517
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,270
Seanng once knew you.

518
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,380
Oh, this is a long journey.

519
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,210
Let me prepare you
before you left.

520
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,240
l knew if tired after
the trip could be lost

521
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,280
after a cup of tea.

522
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,380
Slowly, Chip.

523
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,360
Nice to meet you.

524
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,390
Want to see me do the trick?

525
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,270
Chip.

526
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,400
You did a very brave thing
for your father, dear.

527
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,270
Yes, so in our opinion.

528
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,510
l'm worried about him.
He was never alone.

529
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,480
Calm down, dear. Everything
will change in the end.

530
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,350
You'll feel much
better after dinner.

531
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,460
But he said, ''lf he does not want to
eat with me, then he should not eat.''

532
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,290
People talk carelessly
when angry.

533
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,490
lt is up to us to not listen.

534
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,460
You coming, dear?

535
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,490
They came. Semuanay
last inspection.

536
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,400
- Fast. - Come on.

537
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,460
lf the host know you
made the girl's food,

538
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,270
- She'll blame me.
- l'll make sure of it.

539
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,300
But what you see? l
tell this girl man.

540
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,370
They should fall in love that we
return to a human being again,

541
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,280
and how they can fall in love
if she stays in her room?

542
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,440
- Hey, you there is still dirt.
- Excuse me.

543
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,210
- Excuse me.
- You know that girl would not love him.

544
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,410
Hours broken right twice
a day, my friend.

545
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,290
But this is not the time.
Come on.

546
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,520
Now it's time to shine!

547
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,460
Hey, l could not feel,
but l know this is bad.

548
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,500
Move over, you're bothering me.

549
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,300
- Fast. - Come on.

550
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,430
- Slowly. - Of course.

551
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,370
But what is dinner
without music?

552
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,240
- Music?
- Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?

553
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,250
l have not been performed.

554
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,410
l do not even remember how.

555
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,460
- Cavities others.
- Maestro, teeth above.

556
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,430
lncreasingly difficult
to remain conscious.

557
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,230
He's relying on you to help
us to break this curse.

558
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,370
Then l'll play
despite a toothache.

559
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,380
Maestro, play some
soothing music.

560
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,510
Quiet music. Of course.

561
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,480
There are other requests that
you want of my artistic?

562
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,420
- No, that's all.
- There you are, dear.

563
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,390
Nona.

564
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,460
We welcome you with great pride and
pleasure to welcome you this evening.

565
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:46,330
And now, we invite you to relax.

566
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:49,240
Let us take a seat.

567
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:53,340
While the dining room
proudly presents...

568
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,520
Your dinner.

569
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,360

# Do not believe me? ##
Ratings plate-plate #

577
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,400
# They can sing,

578
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,460
#After all, Miss,

579
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,530

#We will prepare

# Be our guest, be our

597
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,350
# Life is very debilitating #

598
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,230
# To the waiter who
did not serve #

599
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:53,500
# He's not himself
without a soul to wait #

600
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,500
#Ah, in moments of
fun where our handy #

601
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,340
True, Cogsworth?

602
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:04,510
# Suddenly an enjoyable
day was lost #

603
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,280
#We've rusted too long #

604
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,280
# Need more than to clean dust #

605
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,390
# Before the exercise, the opportunity
to use our capabilities #

606
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,370
# More often we lazing
in the palace #

607
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:28,240
# Flabby, fat and lazy #
#You're lazy to walk #

608
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,300
# There is a guest,
there is a guest #

609
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,370
# Gosh, we will be blessed #

610
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,350
#Wine has been poured,

#And l do not mind, my dear #

614
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,310
#While the cups

# l will be Hangan, then heat #

617
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,370
# Gosh! That stain? #

618
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,400
# Clean up! We want
to impress guests! #

619
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,210
#We have much to do #

#You want one or two of sugar?

# He is our guest! #

# Be our guest! ## Our
command is your request #

625
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:26,520
###With your food with
your comfortability #

626
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,370
# That's right,
our aim airport #

627
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:34,400
#While the candle
is still burning #

628
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,470
# Let us help you, we will
continue to berinar #

629
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:48,250
# Eat for food #

630
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,410
# One by one #

631
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,360
# Until you shout,
''Enough, l'm full!'' #

632
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,420
# Then we'll sing till you
sleep while you're digesting #

633
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,230
# Tonight you lift your foot #

634
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,230
# But now let's eat #

635
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,430
# Be our guest! #
# Be our guest! #

636
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,330
# Be our guest! #

637
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:17,440
# Please, be our guests! #

638
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,420
Pudding?

639
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,320
Why are you nice to me?

640
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,450
Of course you're
trapped here like me.

641
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,430
You never want to go?

642
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,260
Tuan was not as bad as it looks.

643
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,300
Somewhere, in his soul,
he was a Pengeran.

644
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,400
Someone is waiting
to be unleashed.

645
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,470
Lumiere mentions something
about the west wing.

646
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:50,380
Forget it. Go to sleep, dear.

647
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,280
- Good night. - Good night.

648
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,350
Directly to the room.

649
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,380
What are you doing? What
did you do on a rose?

650
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,450
- There is no.
- You do not realize what can you do?

651
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,430
You can harm us all!
Go away from here!

652
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,230
Go!

653
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,300
- Checkmate. Again. - Wait.

654
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,280
- You cheated again.
- Miss, what are you doing?

655
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,470
- Go away from here. - Stop!

656
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,510
Do not, froufrou.

657
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,310
- Froufrou, stop him.
- Catch him!

658
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,290
Come on!

659
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,450
- Do not, froufrou.
- Do not get out.

660
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,430
- Do not! Dog silly.
- Naughty dog, bad dog!

661
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,230
Do not!

662
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:24,430
- Please do not go! That is dangerous!
- Yikes!

663
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,390
You have to help.

664
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,260
You have to stand.

665
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,250
l'm sure this is the way.
There are a lot of wolves.

666
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,250
That means we're getting
close to the palace.

667
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,320
Simply, we have to go back.

668
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,320
Stop! There he is!

669
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,370
There he is. That tree.

670
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,330
l am sure.

671
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,430
The time it collapsed
due to lightning.

672
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,500
But now the tree...

673
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,400
Stand back again because...

674
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,240
Magic, or the other.

675
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,410
Do you want to marry
into this family?

676
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,320
So it means, istanya toward...
No.

677
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,420
That is...

678
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,320
That way. Certainly.

679
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,350
lt's enough you play us.

680
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,400
Where is Belle?

681
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,460
- The ugly kidnapped her...
- The creature was not real.

682
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:23,300
Or cup speak. Or magic.

683
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:26,470
What was real was the wolves,
frostbite and starvation.

684
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:31,310
lnhale, Gaston.

685
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,510
Why do not we just go
back to the village?

686
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,480
l'm sure Belle was cooking
a delicious evening meal.

687
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:45,260
Why are you offering to help us?

688
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,360
Because he was not my
biological daughter!

689
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,260
Let us go home.

690
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,400
Belle was not at home.
He shared...

691
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,410
Say it again,

692
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,310
- Then l'll make you a wolf food!
- Gaston!

693
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,350
Stop!

694
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,370
Think about things that are fun.

695
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,470
Remember back during the war.

696
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,510
lmagine about the explosion...

697
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,350
-... The women widows. - Widow.

698
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,290
Correct. lmagine.

699
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,290
Correct.

700
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,290
Maurice.

701
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,300
Please forgive me.

702
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,360
That's no way to talk to the
prospective father-in-law, is not it?

703
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,460
Father-in-law?

704
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:33,400
You'll never marry my daughter.

705
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,280
l might have guessed it.

706
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:45,410
lf Maurice does not approve it,
it means he becomes penghalangku.

707
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:49,520
Once the wolf is finished with her,
Belle will not have anyone but me.

708
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,390
l know we're running
out of options,

709
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,520
but maybe you want to think
about how a little more...

710
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,490
-... Human? - You coming?

711
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,270
Sick.

712
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,290
lf you can be quiet, it
will not be too sore.

713
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,380
lf you did not run,
this will not happen.

714
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,260
lf you do not scare me,
l'm not going to run.

715
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,260
You should not go
to the East wing!

716
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,460
You're supposed to learn
to control his anger!

717
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,500
You should rest.

718
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:41,310
- Thank you.
- We are very grateful.

719
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:46,310
- Why are you so concerned about her?
- We have maintained for a long time.

720
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,250
He cursed you, even though
you are not doing anything.

721
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,480
You are right.

722
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:57,280
When Mr. losing his mother,

723
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:02,330
and when the father grabbed the
child a sweet and innocent,

724
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,270
change it to be like his father,

725
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,270
we can only dwell alone.

726
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,300
Let him sleep.

SONG: Days ln The Sun #
days when life begins #

728
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,490
# Not until my day ends #

01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:34,530
#What l'm going to leave #

# l'm willing to give
anything to be back again #

735
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,430
Oh no.

736
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:24,280
# Changing everything
and restore shine #

737
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:32,450
# l sing about the pain
of a difficult day #

738
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:42,490
# Magic ensnare us ## l

739
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:45,530
# ln the midst of this sadness #

740
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,330
# Can love and hope to survive #

741
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:53,280
# For l was naive and unsure #

742
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:56,510
# But now l'm wiser
and wondered #

743
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,510
# Days ago ## l can not
go back to my childhood #

744
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:05,450
# Precious days it is not immortal #
#Yang realized because my father #

745
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,390
# l feel a change #

746
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:14,520
Hugging me tighter ### l
feel stronger but shackled #

747
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:26,230
#A sunny day will return ##We
have to believe Like the love #

748
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:38,250
#Wonderful days it
will come back #

749
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,460
What happens when the
last petals fall?

750
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:43,320
Tuan will be ugly forever.

751
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,350
-And we'll be... - antiques.

752
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,260
- Knick knacks.
- The furniture is rarely used.

753
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,430
Trash. We become garbage.

754
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,340
l want to help you.

755
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,460
There must be a way
to break the curse.

756
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,430
There is one way.

757
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,240
You do not have to
think about it.

758
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,410
We choose our options, and we
must bear the consequences.

759
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:57,420
Drink.

760
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,240
Termia love, Agathe.

761
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,440
Love can change a person's view.

762
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,420
Love looks way of thinking
is not the appearance.

763
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:19,420
And because it was the angel
of love blinded his eyes.

764
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,480
You know Shakespeare.

765
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,360
My education is quite high.

766
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,370
Romeo and Juliet is my favorite.

767
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,300
l'm not surprised.

768
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:39,440
- Sorry?
- She let her heart melt...

769
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,380
...and...

770
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,470
You'd better read another.

771
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,440
Like what?

772
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:51,340
You can start reading
all that is here.

773
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:56,450
You're going to do it?

774
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,500
Awesome.

775
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:15,300
Yes, l think so.

776
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,390
lf you really like it,
then all of it is yours.

777
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,420
Did you read all these books?

778
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,460
Not all.

779
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,340
Some of them speak Greek.

780
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,270
Are you kidding me?

781
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,370
Can you kidding me right now?

782
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,470
Maybe.

783
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,380
The air is so blue
and clear and cold.

784
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,410
Frozen in thin sheets.

785
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:37,260
Rolled stems and twigs

786
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:42,230
Each foliage in a blanket by...

787
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,390
...glass.

788
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,340
l feel like l've seen this.

789
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,480
What else?

790
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,420
But in the silence...

791
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:15,300
... He heard whispers
from all asleep.

792
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,490
Face. Look at me.

793
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,430
Come and wake me up.

794
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:27,240
Because l'll always be here.

795
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,430
SONG: SOMETHlNG THERE #
There is a sweet and good #

796
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,480
# But he was nasty and rude #

797
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,340
# Now he is changing
and unsure #

798
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:14,290
# l wonder why l did
not realize before #

799
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:29,500
# He glanced over
here l think l see #

800
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:34,270
#When the touch he does not
tremble viewed cakarku #

801
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:38,270
### Ku may not disregard it #

802
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,310
# But he had never seen
me like that before #

803
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:21,220
# New and makes me uneasy #

804
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:30,390
#Who would have thought
this could happen? #

805
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:37,240
# True, he is not a
handsome prince #

806
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:43,510
# But there was something about
him that l did not realize #

807
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,510
Who would have thought
### Bless my soul #

808
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,490
#Who would have thought #

809
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:53,220
#Who would have thought they
would unite with itself #

810
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,490
lt is strange ###We see #

811
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:57,320
#We pay attention
to a few days away #

812
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:00,360
# There may be something
that was not there #

813
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,230
# There may be something
there that was not there #

814
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,430
What, Mom?

815
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:15,440
# There may be something
there that was not there #

816
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,470
What is that? What is
going on over there?

817
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,310
l'll let you know
when you've grown.

818
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,440
OK. l've grown up.

819
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,450
Oh, Chip.

820
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,380
You're a grown-up.

821
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,400
- What are you reading?
- lt is nothing.

822
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,510
l guess ''Lancelot.''

823
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:55,250
Actually, ''King Arthur and the
Knights of the Roundtable.''

824
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,350
Nonetheless,

825
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:00,290
- The reading romance. - OK.

826
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,350
l have to thank you
for saving my life.

827
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,230
l have to thank you because it
has been rescued from the wolf.

828
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,500
- You know how to enjoy life.
- Yes.

829
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,270
When l walked into the
room and laughing.

830
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,340
l also.

831
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,440
The villagers told
me a strange girl.

832
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,280
l do not know they are
praising or insulting.

833
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:31,380
Sorry.

834
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,410
Your village does not seem good.

835
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,260
l felt lonely as does kastilmu.

836
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,320
Why do not we run away together?

837
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:57,340
lt was a gift from the witch.

838
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,450
Books that can help you escape.

839
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,350
Awesome.

840
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,490
This game is the most violent.

841
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,290
Almost like a curse.

842
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:21,430
This world has no place
for creatures like me.

843
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,300
But you can.

844
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:33,250
Think of a place
you want to visit.

845
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,450
Discover in mind.

846
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
Feel in your heart.

847
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:14,320
Where is this?

848
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,420
Paris.

849
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:20,250
Oh, l remember Paris.

850
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,490
What do you want to see first?

851
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:26,330
Rotterdam. Champs-Elysees.

852
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,270
No? Too many tourists?

853
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,200
Smaller than l imagined.

854
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:47,250
SONG: How Does a Moment Last Forever
# This is my childhood Paris #

855
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,420
Once this is my
life boundary ##

# Difficult to forget #

860
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,410
Knowing the Paris
of my childhood ##

861
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:21,290
# Has gone #

862
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,400
What happened to your mother?

863
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:32,430
He never told me.

864
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:34,400
l never dared to ask.

865
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,340
Mask doctor.

866
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:57,290
We have to go now.

867
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,490
- Drink this.
- lt would kill him, too.

868
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,240
Sorry to call your
father a thief.

869
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:29,260
Let us go home.

870
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,390
lt sucks.

871
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:42,500
At least we were not in the trees
and surrounded by a pack of wolves.

872
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,410
You know not too
late to go back.

873
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:52,370
Every time l close my eyes,

874
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:58,350
l imagined when l was stranded,
and when l opened my eyes...

875
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,420
Maurice.

876
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,420
Gaston. You're trying
to kill Maurice?

877
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:13,390
Maurice. Fortunately.

878
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,360
l've been looking for five days.

879
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:20,380
You're trying to kill me. You
left me with a herd of wolves.

880
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,410
Wolf?

881
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,280
l understand, if
you're imagining,

882
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:27,340
but not if you accusing me of
deliberately want to kill you.

883
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:32,220
Maurice, do you have proof?

884
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:37,450
- Tanya Agathe, he saved me.
-Agathe?

885
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:43,390
You accuse based on
statements from an old woman?

886
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,300
Sorry, Agathe.

887
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:51,310
Mr. LeFou. He was there.

888
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:53,240
She saw everything.

889
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:56,280
l? You are right.

890
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,340
Do not joke.

891
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,320
LeFou.

892
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,320
Dear friend of mine.

893
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:07,420
ls it me, the most loyal friend,

894
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:11,290
tried to kill the father of
a woman who l really love?

895
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:16,290
That question is
quite difficult.

896
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:18,330
But the answer is no.

897
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,390
He did not try to kill Maurice.

898
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,430
Basic you...

899
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,410
Maurice.

900
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,420
l hate to say this, but you'll endanger
yourself and the people around you.

901
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:39,390
That is why Belle run.

902
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,390
You need help.

903
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:44,390
A place to take a
load off your mind.

904
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:51,230
Everything will be alright.

905
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,470
l saw her in the
ballroom and said,

906
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:59,440
''l will make all look beautiful
and tonight we'll dance.''

907
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,280
l did not think he
would say ''yes.''

908
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,440
- What l think? - No, sir.

909
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,240
lt was perfect.

910
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,480
Petals roses are only four,
it means to be tonight.

911
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,510
You must tell your
feelings to her.

912
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,410
l feel stupid.

913
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:17,290
- He might not love me.
- Do not be discouraged.

914
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,490
He is.

915
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:22,400
Stop saying that.

916
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:27,270
- No way we are united.
- You care about him, is not it?

917
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,430
Then, with romantic
music and candles...

918
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,500
True, and when the
time is right...

919
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,310
How could l know?

920
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,510
Do not worry, sir.
You'll be fine.

921
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:45,350
Do not be too nervous and
say you feel about Belle.

922
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,420
Because if not, l swear you
will drink cold tea forever.

923
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:51,460
- ln the dark. - Full dust.

924
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:53,490
Dark and very dusty.

925
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,500
Starting from his
hair, comb his hair.

926
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,430
l'll take care of her nails.

927
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:02,230
l'll brush her teeth.

928
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:11,250
Rub her nails. Polishing horns.

929
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,370
Close your eyes.

930
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,510
And this is the last.

931
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,210
Voila!

932
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:21,360
OK. l can clean up this.

933
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,340
Oh, beautiful.

934
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,390
But something is missing.

935
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,270
Oh, right.

936
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,500
Last touch.

937
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,460
SONG: Beauty and the Beast
story of the ancient ##

938
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,430
#What is the real #

939
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:51,410
### But not friends

940
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:54,440
#Without the suspect #

941
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:00,410
# Only a few changes #

942
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:08,300
### Both Little change
slightly scared #

943
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,390
# Both were not ready #

944
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:16,460
# The beauty and the Beast #

945
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,480
Always the same ##

946
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:38,320
#Always surprising #

947
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:46,340
# Same as previous #
#Always confident #

948
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:52,310
#As the sun always rises #

949
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:57,440
# The story of the ancient #

950
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,450
# The music is old-fashioned #

951
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:11,490
# Fun painful and strange #
# Be aware you can change #

952
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:16,400
# Be aware that you're wrong #

953
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:33,210
#As Like the sun #

954
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:41,320
The rises in the East ###
The story of the ancient #

955
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,490
# Rhythms ancient song #

956
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:49,490
# The beauty and the Beast #

957
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:59,310
### The story is ancient
ancient rhythm of the song #

958
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:07,510
# The beauty and the Beast #

959
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,290
After all this time,

960
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,330
l almost forgot the taste.

961
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:41,250
This seems stupid.

962
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:44,320
For such a creature l hope...

963
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:47,380
... One day it will
get your attention.

964
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,360
- l do not know. - Really?

965
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:55,290
Do you think you
will be happy here?

966
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,500
Whether a person can be
happy without freedom?

967
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:14,320
My father taught
me how to dance.

968
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,250
l often stepped on his foot.

969
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,320
You must miss him.

970
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,390
Very.

971
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,460
You want to see him?

972
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,470
l want to see my father.

973
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,210
Father!

974
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,220
What did they do to him?

975
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,260
He is in danger!

976
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,220
Then you have to get there.

977
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:01,330
What are you saying?

978
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,230
You've got to save.

979
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,400
You need to hurry.

980
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,240
Bring it.

981
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,270
So you have a way to see me.

982
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,410
thanks.

983
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,430
Oh, my God.

984
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,470
Sir, l've figured everything
would run smoothly.

985
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,370
True love always wins.

986
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,510
l let it go.

987
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,220
What?

988
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,370
Sir, why did you do it?

989
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:30,320
l must.

990
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:34,360
- But why?
- Because he loves her.

991
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:39,260
- So why do we not change?
- Because Belle does not love him.

992
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,390
- Now it's too late.
- But he might come back.

993
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,490
No.

994
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,400
l released him.

995
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,460
l hope l can do the
same thing to you.

996
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:52,370
Go.

997
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,400
Our time is running out.

998
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,410
Go on, my love.

999
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:07,420
l who have myself.

1000
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:12,380
l am the master of my faith.

1001
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:18,400
l never needed
anybody in my life.

1002
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:22,300
l learned today.

1003
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,400
l'll never feel the pain.

1004
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:31,480
l closed my eyes, but
he's still there.

1005
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,460
More than me.

1006
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:49,230
Now l know you never feel it.

1007
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:54,230
Although he escaped.

1008
01:31:54,270 --> 01:32:02,230
He kept torturing me, coming to hurt
me, menggerakanku, come against me.

1009
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:07,250
Waiting for my loneliness.

1010
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,420
Waiting at the end
of the open door.

1011
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:16,390
l feel myself to appear
in front of him.

1012
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:22,490
And along with me forever more.

1013
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:28,290
l'm ready to fight
a crazy court.

1014
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,340
l hit the light is blurred.

1015
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:38,240
He is already in reach.

1016
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:44,380
He was never far outside.

1017
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:49,290
And l knew he would
never see me.

1018
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:54,400
Although he felt guilt.

1019
01:32:54,430 --> 01:33:03,240
He's still inside me. He
taught everything l do.

1020
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:11,510
Waiting loneliness, waiting
at the end of the open door.

1021
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,450
l walked right in front of him.

1022
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:20,360
And it perbicaraan in
a very long night.

1023
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:34,270
l think it could be waiting
here forever more...

1024
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:52,390
Come on.

1025
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:54,510
Exempt queen, please.

1026
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,220
He was in the hospital.

1027
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,320
Not in silence.

1028
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:04,300
Do not you see? You deserve
to be in a mental hospital?

1029
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,370
You would not last a week.

1030
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,370
Submit your daughter to me,
and l'll set you free.

1031
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,340
Will never.

1032
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:24,350
Stop.

1033
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,490
- Pa. - Oh, boy.

1034
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:40,500
- l thought l lost you.
- Let her go.

1035
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,470
Please release him.

1036
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:45,270
We can not do that Miss Potts,
we'll take care of it properly.

1037
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:46,500
My father was not crazy.

1038
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,330
Gaston. Tell him.

1039
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,470
You know how l am
loyal to your family,

1040
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:53,380
but your father made
amazing claims.

1041
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,320
That's right Bell.

1042
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,450
He discusses about a
monster in the palace.

1043
01:34:58,450 --> 01:35:01,390
l just got out of the palace,
and there was a monster.

1044
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:04,430
You can say anything to release,
words are difficult to prove.

1045
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:06,290
You want proof?

1046
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,520
Show me the monster that to me!

1047
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,330
That's the proof.

1048
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,310
lt's unbelievable.

1049
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:26,510
See the monster.

1050
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:29,380
Look at this.

1051
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,240
Here.

1052
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:35,520
Gosh. Do not be afraid.
She is gentle, and kind.

1053
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:40,350
lt smelled like a monster.

1054
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:44,400
lf l do not know right or bad.
He remains concerned him.

1055
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,470
He was not a monster, Gaston!

1056
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,330
You're the monster.

1057
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,360
Monster was not going
to hurt anyone.

1058
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:55,470
Hearts have been infected with dark
magic, l've never seen in my life.

1059
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,510
This rift in our great justice.

1060
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:59,500
Yes! Do something!

1061
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,310
We're not going to run
to win from monsters.

1062
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,490
Catch him also.

1063
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:04,480
No!

1064
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,490
- Get him! - No!

1065
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,390
You're not going to get
away with this, Gaston.

1066
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,320
Gaston.

1067
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,450
Why fat? You want to be next?

1068
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,520
That's what l said.

1069
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:22,330
Alert, this village will be
damned if we do not stop it.

1070
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:26,310
- Yes! - We kill that monster!

1071
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:29,440
Kill the monster! Kill him!

1072
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,280
lt's safe here until he
comes at night to scare us.

1073
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,270
With sacrifice. l was not
appetizing at the monsters.

1074
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,340
He will attack our village,
do not let him free.

1075
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:42,520
lt is now time for
action, everything.

1076
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:48,400
Now it's time to follow.

1077
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:52,530
He disguised himself and came out of the
darkness, From the shadow of a nightmare.

1078
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,470
And it was most encouraging.

1079
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,270
Save them.

1080
01:36:56,270 --> 01:37:00,500
He would sneak into the palace, and
did something terrible inside.

1081
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:04,280
He's a monster, he's got fangs.
Sharp.

1082
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:07,410
Large claw, claw
killer for a party

1083
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:12,380
Hear him roar, see the foam! But we
did not get home before he died!

1084
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,480
Until he's dead!
Kill the monster!

1085
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:20,450
Turn obormu, Saddle your horse.

1086
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,330
Put your courage in place.

1087
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:25,270
Call it war, call it a threat.

1088
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:27,390
You can bet they will all
follow for at a time like this,

1089
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,340
they will carry out my orders.

1090
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,440
There's a monster.

1091
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,430
Running clay, no question.

1092
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:36,270
But l'm worried that the
wrong monster released.

1093
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:39,340
Take ajourney! Calculate!
Hold your sword! Hold thine!

1094
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,250
Praise the Lord
and here we come!

1095
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,320
Show me the palace.

1096
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,420
At least they finally
learn to love.

1097
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:55,420
ln other words, they
do not have love.

1098
01:37:55,460 --> 01:38:00,460
lt's the first time for
me l was being rude.

1099
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,490
you hear that? ls it painful?

1100
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,270
ls he back?

1101
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:07,240
l told you.

1102
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,310
Lots of infidels.

1103
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:11,340
We fight them.

1104
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,340
This is it.

1105
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:15,380
That is true love.

1106
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:22,420
Prepare mortar, and step aside.

1107
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:26,330
There is a place in the back,
we had to line up in battle.

1108
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,420
and not afraid of the
dangers that come.

1109
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:35,290
There were black in this song,
We will give this song.

1110
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:40,330
We came to fight.

1111
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,280
Come on, we need help.

1112
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,320
- We must help the monster.

1113
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:52,510
How did you get out of here?

1114
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:56,480
He let me go.

1115
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,230
He released me to see you.

1116
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,530
l do not understand.

1117
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,400
What are you?

1118
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,270
He brought me there.

1119
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:17,470
l know what happened
to my mother.

1120
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:21,280
Then you know why l
have to keep it secret?

1121
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,410
l had to protect you, l should
always protect my daughter.

1122
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:28,220
Possible excessive.

1123
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,230
l understand.

1124
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,430
Will you help me now?

1125
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,300
This is dangerous.

1126
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,340
Yes.

1127
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,440
l could try to damage the lock.

1128
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:56,250
The key is to me, this.

1129
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,510
Padlock.

1130
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:05,290
You need something sharp.

1131
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,260
Like that.

1132
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,350
Perfect.

1133
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:19,410
- l'm really sorry to bother
you, - she did not return.

1134
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:24,210
No, they were behind the door.

1135
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:28,280
lt is okay. Let them enter.

1136
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:30,510
Kill the monster!

1137
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,280
Kill the monster!

1138
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,380

Kill the monster!

01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,350
Kill the monster!

1141
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,390
Kill that monster.

1142
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:52,340
Do not you realize that
this house may be hunted?

1143
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,340
Do not let yourself uneasy.

1144
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:06,240
This place looks familiar. l
had never been here before.

1145
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:13,450
Oh, hello. You
must teacup spoke.

1146
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,360
And you must be his mother.

1147

The mother of his best friends?
Attack!

1148

He is so strong.

Do you have children?

1157
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:34,370
Not until we get you.

1158

Those soldiers who called the

Time's up.

Where is he?

When we returned to the

01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,360
- Henry. - Henry?

1252
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:24,340
- Henry? - Oh, l'm so lonely.

1253
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:25,470
To become an hour.

1254
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:27,430
To become an hour.

1255
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:29,500
Lumieas.

1256
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,410
See.

1257
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:35,240
Oh, prince.

1258
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:40,350
- Hello, old friend.
- Nice to meet you.

1259
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:43,360
- You look like a nanny?
- No, she was the queen.

1260
01:56:43,390 --> 01:56:45,290
She was the queen.

1261
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:53,300
The oldest fairy tales.

1262
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:57,500
The oldest song rhyme.

1263
01:56:57,510 --> 01:57:00,300
Bitter-sweet and strange.

1264
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:02,400
Knowing you can change.

1265
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:06,440
Studying're wrong, oh.

1266
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,450
Papa.

1267
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:33,360
Hunger turned into a party.

1268
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:36,380
Nature shows the way.

1269
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:39,480
Nothing could be delivered.

1270
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:47,310
Beauty and the Monster.

1271
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:52,430
- What is that?
- How are you feeling slightly grow?

1272
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:54,330
l do not know.

1273
01:57:59,430 --> 01:58:04,340
Certain as the sun.

1274
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:08,240
Rises in the east.

1275
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:13,340
The oldest fairy tales,
poems are the oldest song.

1276
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:16,350
Beauty and the Monster.

1277
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:25,390
The oldest fairy tales.
The oldest song rhyme.

1278
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:30,460
Beauty and the Monster.
