"Despicable Me 3 (2017)" ^ (Run time  01:22:25)

2
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:06,005
Starring young Balthazar Bratt
as a child prodigy

3
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,633
and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.

4
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:12,639
There he is!
Get him!

5
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,709
I've been a bad boy!

6
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,607
Bratt was the biggest child actor
of the 1980s,

7
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:24,964
striking a chord with audiences
all over the world.

8
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,220
- Yay!
- Yeah!

9
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:27,546
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

10
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,809
There he is!
Get him!

11
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,632
But it all came to an end
in season three,

12
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:32,658
When...

13
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:35,212
I've been a bad boy!

14
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:38,714
- The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.
- Boy? Boy?

15
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,934
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

16
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,373
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral.

17
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:50,589
Starting to actually believed he was
the character he played on TV.

18
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:52,560
What are you looking at?

19
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:54,461
Leading us all to wonder...

20
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:56,777
Where is he now?

21
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:04,429
You know what, Clive?

22
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:06,953
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

23
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:10,458
but being one in real life
is even better.

24
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:11,864
Heist music!

25
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,717
Here it comes.

26
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:17,601
Ow! What?
Clive!

27
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,444
What are you doing?
How is that heist music?

28
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,503
Sorry, my bad.

29
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:56,757
Ewww!

30
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:58,949
Wha-whoa!
Gah!

31
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,631
Mommy!

32
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:05,535
Stop him!

33
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:11,527
Sir, the ship has been boarded by
some kind of... monster.

34
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,412
Wait, that's not a monster.

35
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:16,330
That's a man
wearing shoulder pads.

36
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:20,226
There's only one supervillain whose
fashion sense is quite that dated

37
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,213
Balthazar Bratt.

38
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,941
Blast it!
The Dupont Diamond is on that ship!

39
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:29,384
I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately.

40
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,336
Ha, ha, ha... !

41
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:34,358
Woo-hoo!

42
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:37,200
We're already here!
Agents Grucy are closing in fast.

43
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,917
Yes... wait, wha?
What did you call us?

44
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,855
Grucy. You know,
Gru and Lucy mushed together.

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,903
Try it.

46
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,334
Haha!
I like it, but not a lot,

47
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,975
I don't like it.

48
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,774
Stop!

49
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,150
On the ground!

50
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,804
The jewel!
Move!

51
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,432
Go, go, go!

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,655
Uh?

53
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,939
Too late again, Gru.
Ha, ha, ha... !

54
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,221
WHAAA... ?

55
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:47,259
He's getting away!!

56
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,109
That's what he thinks.

57
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:55,054
- Wahooo!
- Ha, ha!

58
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,855
Go, go!

59
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:59,080
Ugh!
Go, go.

60
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,004
Go, go, go!

61
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,908
I don't think
we can make it, Gru.

62
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,620
We can make it!

63
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:13,900
We can make it... !

64
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,641
No, we can't!

65
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,340
Get ready!

66
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:24,004
Get ready for whaaa... !

67
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:34,884
Hey.
How're you doing?

68
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,617
Are you okay?

69
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:40,657
- Hello.
- Oh.

70
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:42,578
You guys are so cute.

71
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,518
Go get him, Gru Gru!

72
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:46,722
Hello, Gru.

73
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:48,928
How's your transition coming?

74
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:52,636
You know, from world's worst villain
to world's worst agent?

75
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,051
Oh, that's hilarious!
You should be on TV!

76
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,104
Oh, that's right,
you were...

77
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,174
but then you got canceled.

78
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,104
Ha ha!

79
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:02,791
What about that?

80
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,997
What?
Oh! Girls… !

81
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:06,026
Oh!

82
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,614
Dance fight!

83
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:23,761
Ow!

84
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,881
Alpha team, the diamond is secure.

85
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,644
Come and pick up the package.

86
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,157
Copy that, Alpha team on approach.

87
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,945
Gru.

88
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,308
- Did you actually think
I was unconscious?
- Oh.

89
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,437
It's called acting, hoser!

90
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:48,335
And clearly I've still got it!

91
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:07,193
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

92
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,421
Freeze!
Don't move!

93
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:09,818
Son of a Betamax!

94
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,354
Go! Go!
Get him! Get him!

95
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,186
He's getting away!

96
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:16,686
This isn't over, Gru!
You hear me?

97
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,740
This is not over!

98
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:22,217
Yeah?
Well, I still have the diamond!

99
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:27,975
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to...

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,496
Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.

101
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:38,051
Happy birthday to you.

102
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:41,111
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

103
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:43,548
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah!

104
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:47,436
Party!
Party, everyone!

105
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,743
DESPICABLE ME 3

106
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:02,453
Hey!
Watch it!

107
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,449
I can't believe
Bratt got away, again.

108
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,316
How is this possible?
How...

109
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,376
And it's not just that he got away!
It's that he's so smug about it!

110
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,061
Ewww.
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!

111
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,648
Edna, hey.

112
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:32,459
Looking hot... today.

113
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,404
Got the... cats on you.

114
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:36,632
And it was just so humiliating.

115
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:39,830
Dangling there in the
bubble-gum Speedo.

116
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:42,233
And I didn't have time to go
to the gym this week!

117
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,821
And I had a big breakfast!

118
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:47,686
I was feeling a little bloated!

119
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:51,560
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.

120
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:56,001
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

121
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,545
And another thing!

122
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,856
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

123
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,778
Thank you all for coming
in such short notice.

124
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:15,923
It is with great sadness that
I inform you that as of today

125
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:20,147
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

126
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,169
Oh no.

127
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:30,986
Your new leader is coming directly from
head office, effective immediately.

128
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:38,932
She is the very gifted, very ambitious
Miss Valerie Da Vinci.

129
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:44,798
As I look out over all of your faces,
I am flooded with so many memories.

130
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:48,071
- Oh boy, this is a snoozeday.
- I... Excuse me.

131
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:52,130
Blah blah blah. We understand.
You're old, you're fat, you're done.

132
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,258
Let me breathe in.

133
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:58,036
Woo.
Broke a little sweat there.

134
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,080
First order of business.

135
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:04,335
Which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?!

136
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:07,511
Uh… that would be me.

137
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:11,929
Although I don't know
if I'd say 'loser' per Se,

138
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:13,751
 kind of a...
Huh!

139
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:19,010
Oh, it's the girls.
Not a good time.

140
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,502
- Hey!
- Aaah!

141
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:23,483
Yes, sir.
Huh, uh... ma'am.

142
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:24,874
You're making me nervous.

143
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,916
How could you let Balthazar Bratt,

144
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:31,617
the AVL's most-wanted villain,
just get away?

145
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:33,929
That is the opposite of
what we do here!

146
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:38,122
Okay, okay, yes,
maybe he got away... again,

147
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,922
but he didn't get the diamond!

148
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:44,038
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

149
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:46,269
This close!

150
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,074
Huh?
Interesting.

151
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,408
You're fired!

152
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:50,589
Huh!
What?

153
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:53,475
This is totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent.

154
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,880
You know what?
If you fire him,

155
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,318
you're going to have to fire me,
sister sister.

156
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:01,049
And do you really want to do that?
Do ya?

157
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:02,940
No, no, no, no, no.

158
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,962
Well, I guess she did!

159
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,288
Honey, you didn't have to do that.

160
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,075
I know how much
you love your job.

161
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,238
Well, I love other things more.

162
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,664
You know, we're going to
have to tell the girls.

163
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,457
Can you do it?

164
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:32,288
The whole Mom thing is
still kind of new to me.

165
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,106
Oh, sure.

166
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,423
Hello?

167
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,792
- Aloha!
- Aloha!

168
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,357
Oh!

169
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,233
This is unexpected.

170
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,722
Well, you never got to go
on a honeymoon, so…

171
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,007
We made you dinner!

172
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:12,175
It's a luau!

173
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,981
We got pineapples and
coconuts and lukuleles!

174
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:17,308
- Oh ho, yeah.
- Yeah.

175
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:21,212
Hey!
Ya malatika tika, hee ha!

176
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:23,226
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

177
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:25,623
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

178
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,559
Ahem.

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,249
The soup of the day,
madame and monsieur.

180
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,817
The gummy bears were my idea.

181
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:45,039
Mmmmmm…
Looks too good to even eat!

182
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,680
Am I right?

183
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:50,319
- But I made it for you.…
- Oh.

184
00:12:53,596 --> 00:13:00,961
Good soup! I love the combination
of gummy bears and meat!

185
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,004
I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth,

186
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,989
because it's so good
I don't want to swallow it.

187
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,673
So.
How was work?

188
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:15,032
Did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

189
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:19,733
Well, actually,
today Lucy and I

190
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:24,835
were invited to not work
at the AVL anymore.

191
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:27,072
Huh!
No!

192
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,052
You got fired?

193
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,941
Oh no!
No, no, no...

194
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,671
- Yes.
- What?

195
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:37,650
But don't worry,

196
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:40,334
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs real soon.

197
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,602
Even better ones.

198
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:46,203
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

199
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:49,508
Oh, I know!
You could gamble online!

200
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,583
That's what Katie's dad does!

201
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:54,473
Okay, we will definitely
look into that.

202
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:56,347
That's a good suggestion.

203
00:13:56,372 --> 00:14:00,711
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

204
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:03,296
Hmm.

205
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:09,545
Guys, shhhhhh.
I don't think you heard me right.

206
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,221
No, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean
that we are going back to being villains.

207
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,007
- Oh.
- Oh.

208
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:16,489
Boring!
Anything, please!

209
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:18,641
Okay, alright,
I get it.

210
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,247
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately,

211
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:27,188
especially with Doctor Nefario
accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,

212
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:29,695
Ow!

213
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,504
but our life of crime is over!

214
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:37,861
Mel.
Mel, you're with me on this, right?

215
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,573
Look.

216
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:41,216
- Good...
- Yay!

217
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,196
- Boring!
- Boo!

218
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,895
- Good...
- Yay!

219
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,071
- Boring!
- Ohh!

220
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,906
- Good...
- Yay!

221
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,630
- Boring!
- Boo!

222
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:54,178
Minions… no more boring!!

223
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:56,600
Boring!
Boring!

224
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,620
Guys!
Listen to me and read my lips!

225
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:04,131
Lissa me lippo, pomodoro la comquit!

226
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:09,848
What?
What did I say?

227
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:14,112
Oh, okay,
pomodoro la kumquat.

228
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:16,428
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say no more crime?

229
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,289
I cannot accept this.

230
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,925
Don't take that tone with me!

231
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,991
We're not going back to villainy.

232
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:22,336
Uh.
No villainy?

233
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:26,085
Yes. And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

234
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:31,884
Look, if you guys
don't stop that right now,

235
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,813
there will be consequences!

236
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,880
Huh!
I can do whatever I want.

237
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:36,345
Hey.

238
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,521
Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

239
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:41,372
Oh. Listen to this.
I quit!

240
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,095
Bye to you!

241
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,250
What?
You quit?

242
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,266
You're serious?
Come on.

243
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,384
Uh. Uh.
Bud-Buddy?

244
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:55,725
Dave!
Jerry!

245
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:59,780
Great news, guys...
you've been promoted.

246
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:03,670
You're in charge now, eh?
Not bad!

247
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,664
Yipa! Yipo!
Yippee!

248
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:11,201
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!

249
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:13,529
Jeesh.

250
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:27,131
Huh!

251
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:35,329
Monsieur Pompo.

252
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:41,105
To what do we owe the presence
of the world's foremost gem expert?

253
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,097
The chief of police sent me.

254
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:46,062
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

255
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:50,234
The Dupont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

256
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:06,506
Ooh la la.

257
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:09,286
You have been duped.

258
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:10,777
What?
We have?

259
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:11,975
Yes.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,792
By me!

261
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:18,836
Wha-What is... ?

262
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,780
Oh no.
Help!

263
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:31,068
Ha ha ha...

264
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,887
I've been a bad boy!

265
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:49,326
Or should I say,
"Je suis un mauvais garçon!"

266
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,751
Oh.

267
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,721
Hey, Gru,
whatcha doing down here?

268
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:32,483
In the dark.

269
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:33,428
Alone.

270
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:36,271
Oh nothing, just thinking.

271
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,741
You okay?

272
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,418
Oh yes, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

273
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:42,186
It's just…

274
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:48,088
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like a… failure.

275
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,773
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

276
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,303
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

277
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:57,658
If only I could've nailed Bratt.

278
00:18:57,872 --> 00:19:01,259
So many times
I almost had him!

279
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:03,824
But now I'll never
get the chance.

280
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,948
'Cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

281
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:09,613
Gru, you've got to let this go.
It's time to look forward.

282
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:12,286
Things will get better, I promise.

283
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,842
Come this way.
Come this way.

284
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,882
Coming through, make way.

285
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,680
- Coming through.
- Uh, excuse me.

286
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:39,524
Pardon me,
young... people.

287
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:42,915
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

288
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,711
Uh.
Uh, ah.

289
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:46,210
You are looking for Minions?

290
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:48,603
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

291
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:50,857
Gru is a lousy boss!

292
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,279
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

293
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:54,702
Bye!

294
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,295
Idiots.

295
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,690
No. Kyle.
Stop!

296
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:10,753
Kyle, let go.

297
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,385
BRATT STEALS WORLD'S
BIGGEST DIAMOND!

298
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,583
No, no...
you've got to be kidding me.

299
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:18,762
Lucy, did you see...

300
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:22,639
He helps you if you have nightmares,
and he's really good to snuggle with...

301
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,382
Oh no, no, no, Agnes!
Agnes!

302
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,596
So, take good care of him.

303
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:28,322
Thank you!

304
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,990
Agnes, what are you doing?
You...

305
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,870
You sold your unicorn?

306
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:37,027
Well, I just wanted to help.
Since you don't have a job.

307
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,806
I got two whole dollars for it!

308
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,745
- Awwwww.
- Awwwww.

309
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,283
Uh, excuse me.

310
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:46,418
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

311
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:48,099
Yes, but this will only take a....

312
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:50,466
Hey, Eyebrows.
Get off the lawn.

313
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:51,842
Yeah, but...

314
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,243
- Hey, could you...
- Oh uh, of course.

315
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,642
Now, as I was saying.
I...

316
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,293
- Uh... Oh.
- Goodbye.

317
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,299
Listen, Agnes.
You don't need to worry.

318
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:10,125
We're going to be fine.

319
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,403
- For real?
- For real.

320
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:14,226
Now come on,
let's pack this stuff up.

321
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,471
Ow.
Ow.

322
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:18,993
Seriously?
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

323
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:21,751
Excuse me, Mr. Gru.

324
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:25,111
But I really must
have a word with you.

325
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,701
How did you know my name?

326
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:31,153
Allow me to introduce myself...
my name is Fritz, and OW!

327
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:33,424
Uh, good puppy.

328
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:37,968
And I am inquiring…
on behalf of your twin brother, Dru.

329
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,495
He needs your help.

330
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,263
What?
Twin brother?

331
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:42,354
Twin brother?

332
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:43,395
- Twin brother?
- Twin brother?

333
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,313
Oh Yeah.

334
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:47,793
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

335
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:51,698
Your father has recently
passed away and...

336
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:54,614
Okay, cuckoo.
I'm sorry, but my dad died

337
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,274
when I was a baby,
and I don't have any brother.

338
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,633
You've got the wrong guy.

339
00:21:58,658 --> 00:21:59,841
Really?

340
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:03,988
Well, then how do
you explain... this?

341
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:05,894


342
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,127
Ahhhhh!
Bellissimo!

343
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:18,082
- Oh, hello, Gru.
- Hi, Mom.

344
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:22,455
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

345
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,811
There you are, you cute cute.

346
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:35,833
These are my diving instructors,
Vincenzo and Paolo!

347
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,710
Ciao, boys!

348
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:41,029
So what do you want?

349
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:44,473
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

350
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:47,071
How did you find out?
Who told you?

351
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:48,542
Wait, what?
It's true?

352
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,656
You never told me
I had a brother!

353
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:54,209
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born!

354
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:57,774
Yeah, yeah, that was the agreement.

355
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,275
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

356
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:09,204
Shortly after you and your brother
were born, your father and I divorced.

357
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,549
We each took one son
to raise on our own.

358
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:16,472
And promised never
to see each other again.

359
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:22,454
Obviously, I got second pick.

360
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,863
I have a brother.

361
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:36,285
Hey girls, how are things
in row B, huh?

362
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,855
I've put together some
fun activities for the trip.

363
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,860
Who is up for some
Gin Rummy?

364
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:45,746
Yeah. Umm...
We're good.

365
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,646
Oh.
Okay.

366
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:50,308
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

367
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,032
I hope I win.

368
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,795
I wonder what Dru
will be like!

369
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,265
Woo!

370
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,059
Maybe we'll have that twin thing

371
00:23:57,084 --> 00:24:00,130
where we can read
each other's minds, you know?

372
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:03,917
- How cool would that be?!
- Um, super cool.

373
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,653
Ah, ha ha ha...

374
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:15,427
Ooh.

375
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,354
Aah!
Ow! Ow!

376
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:20,894
Woo-hoo!

377
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,178
Freedonia!
Freedonia!

378
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:27,339
Hi, piggy, piggy!

379
00:24:27,364 --> 00:24:30,801
Huh!
Whoa, look at that house!

380
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:32,451
It's like a castle!

381
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:36,491
I can't wait
to meet my brother!

382
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,698
Uh.
What's with all the pigs?

383
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:41,058
This is the family business.

384
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,964
The largest pig farm
in the whole of Freedonia.

385
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:47,759
Okay, nice pig.

386
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:51,008
No!
That's my private part!

387
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:53,335
Owww!

388
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,875
This pig has issues!

389
00:24:56,265 --> 00:24:57,725
Please, come in.

390
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,979
Wow.
Yeah, haha!

391
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:07,709
Whoa!

392
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:10,695
Oh, this is amazing!

393
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,892
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel.
But with pigs.

394
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:26,607
My brother!!

395
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:28,351
- My brother!
- My brother!

396
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:29,610
Gru!

397
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:31,356
Dru!

398
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,133
Ahhhh!
Brother! I am hugging you!

399
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:45,055
I'm so happy!

400
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:49,740
After all these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

401
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:53,713
- Yup, alright, good.
- Oh, look at that!

402
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:55,943
- Woo!
- You must be the beautiful wife!

403
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,124
Beautiful, oh.
Stop it!

404
00:25:59,149 --> 00:25:59,930
Sweet talker.

405
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:03,850
How is my brother finding a wife
like you when he is so bald?

406
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:11,150
Woo-hoo!
These must be my nieces!

407
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:14,947
Huh! You're Agnes,
you're small with big eyes!

408
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:17,191
And it makes me want to
put you in my pocket!

409
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,507
You can't do that.
I'm too big.

410
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:22,090
And Edith,

411
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:25,580
I can tell that you are
a little mischievous.

412
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:28,221
We're going to have to make
a little trouble later.

413
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:29,946
Wha...
I already have!

414
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,647
Ow.
Ow! Ow!

415
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,315
Please, stop.
Why are you doing that?

416
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,706
Ow!
Ow.

417
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:39,182
Fist bump for mischievous behavior.

418
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:42,209
And Margo!
Oh, you are so mature.

419
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,049
I'm guessing what… fifteen?

420
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:46,284
Fifteen?

421
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,927
She's twelve! She looks twelve.
And will always be twelve.

422
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:53,039
So, Dru…
this place is amazing.

423
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:56,807
I mean, you just walk through the doors
and you're like: wooooowwwooowwooooo!!

424
00:26:56,832 --> 00:27:02,259
Eh. It's nice, I guess, sure.
I'm not really into 'things.'

425
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,017
Wow!
This is so cool!

426
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,382
Oh my gosh,
he's even got a helicopter!

427
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,394
This is the best!

428
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,840
Yes, the best.

429
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,220
- All right, let's go home now.
- Home? Why?

430
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:19,895
I don't know, this guy,
with the mansion and the cars

431
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,672
and… all the hair,
silky-smooth, luxurious hair.

432
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:27,062
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

433
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:29,866
Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.
Give him a chance.

434
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:33,462
Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I
catch up on some brother stuff,

435
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,165
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you.

436
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,422
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Awesome.

437
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,727
I love surprises!

438
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,959
Oh, this is perfect.
Mother, daughter bonding time.

439
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:43,181
Let's do it.
Woo-woo!

440
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:45,660
Bye!
You boys have fun.

441
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:48,720
Ha ha ha!
Whoopee!

442
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,630
Now you can be as evil
as Balthazar Bratt

443
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:56,110
with the evil Bratt action figure,

444
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:59,858
featuring music activated
Break Dance mode.

445
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:04,055
Also featuring bubble gum
launching shoulder pads.

446
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:08,022
And the all new
Mega Diamond Laser.

447
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,399
No more math!

448
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:14,217
I've been a bad boy!

449
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,087
Mega Diamond Laser does not
actually incinerate books.

450
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:24,064
How could Hollywood cancel a show
that produced toys like this, Clive?

451
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:26,784
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece.

452
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:29,394
Does no one value
true art anymore?

453
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:31,567
It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.

454
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:35,533
Well, now that I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.

455
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:39,444
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.

456
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,986
Oh, wait! No, it's not!
I hate that tweeb!

457
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,915
And you, Hollywood!

458
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,149
This time, I'm canceling you!

459
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:50,605
And all the losers
who rejected me!

460
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,972
Ha ha ha... !

461
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:57,440
Ooooo, piggy, piggy!

462
00:28:57,465 --> 00:29:00,976
So how are things
going for you, career-wise?

463
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:02,803
Ahhaaaaa… great.

464
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:05,809
So, so great.
Crushing it.

465
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:12,234
Well, I've got something that I think
you will find very interesting.

466
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:16,223
Hold on to your face, Brother.

467
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,331
Whaaaaaaaaaa!

468
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:24,978
Yee-haw!
Ya ya!

469
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:26,439
Eh.
What?

470
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,234
Yee-haw!

471
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,272
Ow!

472
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,875
Huh? Ah!
Salami!

473
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,213
Hey, I got Salami.

474
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,075
Ah, yes, yes.

475
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,590
It's Salami.

476
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:48,040
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Come on, come on.

477
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:52,160
What is all this?

478
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:56,929
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

479
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:00,246
Haha!
Hey.

480
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,168
It's Gru with boobs!

481
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:07,212
Now, feast your eyes on…

482
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:12,609
Dad's lair!
Ta-da!

483
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:18,249
Whoa whoa whoa, wait…
So our dad was a villain?

484
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,561
No, no, no.
Not just a villain.

485
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:24,148
But one of the greatest
of all time!

486
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:28,416
He was known
as the Bald terror.

487
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:31,625
That's him?
Our dad?

488
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,757
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.

489
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,276
He was?

490
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:40,623
But me…
not so much

491
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:46,148
To Dad, I was just a failure.

492
00:30:46,282 --> 00:30:49,250
He never thought I had
what it took to be a villain.

493
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:53,118
But now you can help me
prove him wrong.

494
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:57,934
Brother, teach me the art of villainy!

495
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:02,649
No. No, no, no.
I can't do that.

496
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:07,617
What? But it's our family tradition!
You can't say no to that!

497
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:11,169
Look, I'm sorry.
I've left that life behind me.

498
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:13,667
- End of story.
- Oh.

499
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:16,973
Okay.
I understand.

500
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:19,725
Hmmm…
I wonder what this does?

501
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,188
Huh?

502
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,345
Help.
Help!

503
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,514
No no no...

504
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:26,368
- Aaah!
- Aah!

505
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,520
Holey moley!

506
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:42,496
Dad's villain wheels.
Pretty slick, huh?

507
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,920
Hey, you want to
take her out for a spin?

508
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,027
Just for some fun?

509
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,191
Hmmmmm…

510
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:54,252
Woo-hoo!

511
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,885
Look out!
Whoa! Whoa!

512
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,336
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

513
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,153
What a beautiful day!

514
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:06,629
Zero to 400 in 3 seconds.
Able to withstand a nuclear blast,

515
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:08,837
armed to the teeth!

516
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,514
Oh yeah.
That's pretty nice.

517
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:16,146
- And it's a hybrid.
- LOOK OUT!

518
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:40,151
Dad, help me!

519
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:46,182
I am not enjoying this!

520
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,012
Whoa.
What is going on here?

521
00:32:57,037 --> 00:33:00,956
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival!

522
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,157
Go!

523
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,311
Ooo. Look. Look.
Look at all the candies.

524
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:12,253
Whoa!

525
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:15,719
Lucy, can we get these please?

526
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,386
Okay, but only one each.
I mean it.

527
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,455
- Awww.
- Oh, man.

528
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,838
No, I don't!
Get as many as you want,

529
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,307
- I don't care!
- Yay!

530
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:25,382
Awesome!

531
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,544
- Um.
- What?

532
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:30,925
It's okay to tell them no
sometimes, too, you know.

533
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,560
Moms need to be tough.

534
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,437
Right. Right, tough.
Good one.

535
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:38,090
I can totally do that. You know,
still figuring out this mom thing.

536
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:40,608
Getting my sea legs, matie!

537
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:43,306
It's a unicorn!

538
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:50,726
Can we go in there!
Please please please please please?

539
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:55,090
Um, sure…
Yeah.

540
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:58,453
But first, let's, um…
ooh, look!

541
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:03,059
It's a traditional Freedonian dance!
How amazing does that look?

542
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,834
Chee!
I love this.

543
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,427
The little girls go and get
the cheese from the little boys.

544
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:13,315
That's adorable.

545
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,758
Oh, look at that
poor little guy.

546
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:21,400
With his little boots.
Nobody picked him.

547
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,085
Margo, why don't you go up there?

548
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,334
- No way!
- Okay.

549
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,798
Wait a minute.
No.

550
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:31,399
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

551
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:32,729
Right now.

552
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,561
What?

553
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:35,696
I'm being tougher.
You know, like you said.

554
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:38,769
No. I meant be tougher
on them, not me.

555
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:42,248
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst that could happen?

556
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:46,424
Fine.

557
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,027
Huh!

558
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,591
Wow!

559
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,429
Hey there, I'm Margo.

560
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:57,274
Hello, Margo.

561
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,720
I am Niko.
Would you like some of my cheese?

562
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:04,018
Hmmm...

563
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:07,977
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, Margo! Thank you!

564
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,518
BAM!
I am a great mother.

565
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:14,909
Did you see that, girls?
I lay down the...

566
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:17,711
Oh no…
Where are they?

567
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:20,462
Agnes!
Edith!

568
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,341
Hello.

569
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,028
Uh, look!
A unicorn horn!

570
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,764
My little brain
is going to explode!

571
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:37,631
Ugh, Agnes.
That's a fake.

572
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:41,126
Ohhhh, it's real alright.

573
00:35:41,298 --> 00:35:44,861
That horn
came from the Crooked Forest.

574
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:50,227
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

575
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,574
Laugh!
Laugh, all of you!

576
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:01,223
They all think I'm crazy.

577
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:04,643
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

578
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:06,585
With my own eye!

579
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,044
Wait, wait, wait…
You saw a for-real, live unicorn?

580
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:11,492
What did it look like?

581
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,611
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

582
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:16,676
Was it… fluffy?

583
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:21,747
It was so fluffy
I thought I was going to die.

584
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:24,550
Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

585
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:29,667
They say if a maiden pure of heart
goes into the Crooked Forest,

586
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:35,862
the unicorn will come…
and be hers forever.

587
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:43,757
Agnes!

588
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:50,568
Goal!

589
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:52,468
Excuse me!

590
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:55,166
Girls!
Don't worry, I'm here!

591
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,776
Are you okay?

592
00:36:56,992 --> 00:37:00,195
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you?

593
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:06,560
Unicorns are really real!
And I'm gonna find one!!

594
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:09,204
Sorry, I went a little
mama bear on you.

595
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,152
You know, I heard a scream and…

596
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,045
yeah, okay.
Have a good one!

597
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,501
- Wait for me here!
- Don't.

598
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:22,622
Stop that! Ow!
You kicked me.

599
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:26,700
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

600
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,989
Did you just steal candies?

601
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:29,666
Yes!

602
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,761
That was a lot of
effort for two lollipops.

603
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,177
Oh no!
The police!

604
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:41,248
What do we do?
What do we do?

605
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:44,607
Come on!
This is going to be fun!

606
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,030
The police are going to get us!
I'm freaking out!

607
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:58,543
Brakes!

608
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:02,397
Cops!

609
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,772
Whoa, they're back!

610
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:46,232
Man, that was crazy!

611
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,877
- We're so close to getting busted.
- Tell me about it.

612
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:51,815
I thought you were
going to pee your pants!

613
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,743
- I did!
- You did!

614
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:03,838
Mel, food...

615
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,423
Ugh. Hey, Mel.
Hold on a sec.

616
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,873
We're tired, cold, and hungry.

617
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:10,907
- Mel, hungry.
- Mel, hungry.

618
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:14,447
It's pizza. Over there.
There's food, spaghetti!

619
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:17,881
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

620
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:22,608
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

621
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,618
Hey!
What are you doing?

622
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,189
Intruders!
Intruders!

623
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:35,473
Stop!
Hey, you! Don't move!

624
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,679
Halt!

625
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:44,187
Call for backup!

626
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:47,088
Come on. Come on.
Let's keep going.

627
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,230
Well, you got us here.
Sing something.

628
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:07,456
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

629
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:48,521
Get 'em!
Go! Go!

630
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,096
Hey, you!
Freeze!

631
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,617
Don't move!

632
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:31,383
Hands in the air!

633
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:42,458
Face it, Gru.
Villainy is in your blood.

634
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:45,609
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush.  A little?

635
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:48,867
Well…
Yeah, maybe a little.

636
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:51,768
And now you've got a chance
to get back on top.

637
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:54,614
Get your mojo back.
Become Gru again!

638
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,402
How awesome would that be?

639
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:03,403
Oh please, come on,
just one heist.

640
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:07,321
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere,

641
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:10,595
that you still want to steal.

642
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,802
Hmmmm…
There is something.

643
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:22,012
 How about we steal
the largest diamond in the world?

644
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:24,814
Yes!
I love it!

645
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Oh, thank you, Brother!

646
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,770
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart!

647
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:35,150
Oh! You know what?
We should do something to celebrate.

648
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:39,336
Ohhhh.
I've got the perfect idea.

649
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:43,367
Fritz, my good fellow.

650
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,177
Could you get me
another napkin, please?

651
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:47,667
Oh yes, of course, Miss Edith.

652
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,244
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

653
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,626
Here we are!

654
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:00,592
How's it going?

655
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:03,411
It's me, Gru.

656
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:05,957
And me, Dru.

657
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:10,411
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

658
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:13,105
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

659
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:14,564
Oh!

660
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,877
What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

661
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:20,792
 I'm so grumpy all the time!

662
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:23,091
Hey!
I laugh a lot!

663
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:25,723
And I'm kind of an idiot!

664
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:37,226
Oh, bust in the gut.

665
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:41,413
Look at them!
They had no idea!

666
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:42,998
Total burn.

667
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:45,103
Oh, look,
it's me...Gru!

668
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:48,593
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

669
00:43:48,618 --> 00:43:51,008
Awww. It's so nice to see
you two are getting along

670
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:54,450
- Oh, we're getting...
- Along perfectly.

671
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:56,106
- Wait. Did we...
- Just finish...

672
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:57,128
- Each...
- Other's...

673
00:43:57,153 --> 00:43:58,601
- Sentences?
- Sentences?

674
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,157
Aw, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

675
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,615
And you're gonna stop now,
though, right?

676
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,897
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

677
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:07,471
Uh-huh.

678
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:11,326
So...
what did you guys do today?

679
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:13,136
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

680
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:14,558
Okay.
What is it...

681
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:15,947
All done!

682
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:17,366
Pardon me!

683
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,348
Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

684
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:21,923
Hey, hey, hey, put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

685
00:44:21,948 --> 00:44:24,731
I need to go to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

686
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:26,337
Good night!

687
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,328
What was that about?

688
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:33,229
Agnes thinks she's going to find
a real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

689
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,414
She's totally freaking out.

690
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,811
I feel like someone got's to
tell her the truth.…

691
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:39,056
Not it!

692
00:44:39,189 --> 00:44:40,776
Ohhh, don't worry.

693
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:43,860
Parenting 101.
I've got this.

694
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:48,888
Ummm… And please bless that
when I find the unicorn,

695
00:44:48,913 --> 00:44:51,934
he'll want to come home with me.
And sleep in my room.

696
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:55,207
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

697
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:58,906
And he will use his magical powers
to help me do math.

698
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:00,251
Amen.

699
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,474
Oh.
Hi, Gru.

700
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:09,020
Hey.
So… big day tomorrow.

701
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:11,775
Yeah, I'm finally going to
get to see a unicorn!

702
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,319
 For reals.

703
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,680
If I do, can I bring it home,
please?

704
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:18,811
Ohhh.
Yeah, sure.

705
00:45:18,836 --> 00:45:21,694
Tell you what,
every unicorn you find,

706
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,474
you can bring it home.

707
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:26,757
I'd better build a big pen, right?

708
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,779
But you know…

709
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:33,517
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

710
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,394
Huh?

711
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:37,239
I'm...

712
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:41,858
It might not be good
unicorn finding weather.

713
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:44,376
Umm.

714
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:47,749
They're tricky to find them…

715
00:45:47,774 --> 00:45:49,735
and I don't know…

716
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:59,051
Maybe, just...
maybe unicorns don't really ex...

717
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:04,422
...explore that part of the woods.

718
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:08,824
But the man said

719
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,022
a maiden could find one
if she was pure of heart.

720
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:14,828
And I'm pure of heart, right?

721
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:17,356
The purest.

722
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:24,919
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

723
00:46:24,944 --> 00:46:26,564
Goodnight, sweetie.

724
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:28,477
Goodnight, Gru.

725
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:34,921
Here comes a unicorn.
Here comes a unicorn.

726
00:46:35,111 --> 00:46:37,210
Huh!
Aaaah!

727
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:40,426
I'm okay.

728
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:48,555
Uh.

729
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,900
Hey!
Get that back!

730
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,453
Oh, no!
Run!

731
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:24,952
We've been waiting a long time.

732
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,324
No. No.
Ow!

733
00:47:28,484 --> 00:47:29,659
Huh!

734
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:31,682
Gru?

735
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:56,802
My plane... broke.

736
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,730
Oh.

737
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:09,488
Uh?

738
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:10,775
Huh!

739
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:22,502
Buddies, I've decided.

740
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,956
We're going back to Gru.
We're going back to Gru!

741
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:35,665
Because I'm training for
the big day,

742
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,416
nobody's gonna stop me

743
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:44,053
'cause I am super sassy.
Super sassy. Super sassy.

744
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,216
What's today's plan, boss?

745
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:47,912
What's the plan?

746
00:48:47,937 --> 00:48:50,191
Silly robot.
I'll show you the plan.

747
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:53,296
Time to watch a very
special episode of Evil Bratt

748
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:57,230
to see exactly what I'm going
to do to stupid Tinseltown.

749
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,645
This week on Evil Bratt.

750
00:49:03,077 --> 00:49:08,404
It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!
Open fire!

751
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,426
Nice try, coppers.
Chew on this!

752
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:22,823
He's shooting his super sticky
self inflating gum!

753
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:24,831
Run!

754
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:27,859
Gum one!
Gum all!

755
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,087
Gum one.
Gum all.

756
00:49:31,112 --> 00:49:34,751
Seriously, how did this show
never win an Emmy?

757
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:40,077
And now, it's your turn to...

758
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:51,863
Hey, Clive.

759
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:56,170
I guess you can say our plan
was... out of this world.

760
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,395
Now that's entertainment.

761
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,353
Come on.
Let's make it a reality.

762
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,083
Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest,

763
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:14,316
in search of the
mythical unicorn.

764
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:15,819
For some reason.

765
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:19,239
And here she is,
the fearless unicorn hunter, seeking the...

766
00:50:19,264 --> 00:50:20,672
Edith, stop it!

767
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:22,906
You're gonna scare away the unicorn!

768
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,361
If somehow we actually
find a unicorn,

769
00:50:25,386 --> 00:50:27,344
I'm gonna film it
and get rich.

770
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:29,248
Look over there!

771
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:31,367
Wooah!

772
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:34,468
This is it!
This is where we're gonna see it!

773
00:50:34,937 --> 00:50:37,942
Unicorns, here we come.

774
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:39,095
What's that for?

775
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,118
Bait.
Duh.

776
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:42,581
Come on!

777
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:47,219
Now all we have
to do is wait.

778
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:52,720
Okay.
This is Bratt's lair.

779
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:54,801
It may not look like much,
but this place is armed

780
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:57,973
with some of the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

781
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:00,160
It's considered impenetrable.

782
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:03,226
But a piece of cake for us,
right, Brother?

783
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:07,501
This is not like stealing lollipops.

784
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:10,603
Whoa!

785
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,195
This security system can detect
an air assault from any direction.

786
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,223
No!
Ouch!

787
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:21,809
No!
Ouch!

788
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:24,524
Please! Stop!
Ouch!

789
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:29,190
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

790
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:30,394
Next.

791
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:34,290
Then there are these deadly spikes.

792
00:51:34,315 --> 00:51:37,305
Ha ha ha ha!
Geronimo!

793
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:42,030
Covered with enough poison
to blow your mind... literally.

794
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,050
Ouch!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

795
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:45,523
Ah...
Good to know.

796
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:46,762
So here's the plan.

797
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:49,814
You're the getaway driver.

798
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:51,354
So you'll wait in the boat.

799
00:51:51,379 --> 00:51:53,561
Wait, hold on.
Wait in the boat?

800
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:57,230
But... I want to be
in on the actions!

801
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,842
The getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

802
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:06,423
Do you know how hard it is
doing nothing, touching nothing,

803
00:52:06,448 --> 00:52:09,514
with all of the adrenaline
coursing through your veins…

804
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:11,253
and you must wait.

805
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:13,243
Can I count on you?

806
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:16,066
I guess so…

807
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:20,069
So... I'll climb up the cube
and enter here.

808
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:22,510
Then once I'm inside,
I'll find the diamond.

809
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:26,634
 I've underestimated Bratt before.
This is not going to be easy.

810
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:29,334
I think we can handle it.

811
00:52:31,407 --> 00:52:35,201
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable.

812
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:37,488
Whoa.
Ay, chihuahua!

813
00:52:37,513 --> 00:52:39,268
I got the black one.

814
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:44,456
It's go time!

815
00:52:54,325 --> 00:52:56,880
Hello.
Oh, hi.

816
00:52:56,905 --> 00:52:59,996
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

817
00:53:00,021 --> 00:53:04,915
I present you with pig to confirm
my engagement to your daughter.

818
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:08,937
- Hey, what now?
- What's going on?

819
00:53:08,962 --> 00:53:10,430
Remember, little boots?

820
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:13,856
- Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
- Whoa! Hey!

821
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:16,267
He seems to think you're engaged.

822
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,102
What?
We're not engaged!

823
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:22,184
Look, Niko.
You seem like a very nice boy

824
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:23,731
With a very nice pig.

825
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:26,102
Uh, but you're not engaged.

826
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:29,381
Okay?
It's not happening.

827
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:32,443
I understand.
Who was I kidding?

828
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:36,424
A dumpling like me with
a goddess like you?

829
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:40,793
But I promise:
I will never forget you, Margo.

830
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,260
Never.

831
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:46,256
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I won't forget you, either.

832
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:48,593
Bye.
Bye, Niko.

833
00:53:48,618 --> 00:53:51,100
Wow, that was crazy!
Wooo!

834
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,339
That was totally humiliating!

835
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:56,582
Taking a bite of that cheese was
the stupidest thing I've ever done.

836
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,002
Why did I listen to you?

837
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:00,419
Right, but it's over now, so...

838
00:54:00,444 --> 00:54:03,233
Ugh, here we go.
Niko...

839
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:07,543
You!
You refuse my son's engagement pig?

840
00:54:07,568 --> 00:54:08,171
What?

841
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:13,425
May you and your daughter die
a slow death and be buried with onions!

842
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:17,185
Alright, lady.
That's it!

843
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:22,612
Nobody...nobody! ...curses my daughter!
You got that?

844
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:25,593
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!

845
00:54:25,618 --> 00:54:30,146
 And I promise, you do not
want to mess with me!

846
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:32,508
 Do you understand me?

847
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:33,645
Yes, yes.

848
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,574
Good.
Now, GET!

849
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:42,750
Look, Margo.
I think we just need to... Oh.

850
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:47,442
Yes!

851
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:49,854
Oh!
I've to tell Gru!

852
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,468
- Can we go back now?
- Already?

853
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:10,197
Just a couple more hours!

854
00:55:10,222 --> 00:55:12,707
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

855
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:15,577
I don't understand.

856
00:55:15,602 --> 00:55:17,920
I did exactly
what the man said.

857
00:55:17,945 --> 00:55:21,253
You mean that one-eyed, scar-faced man
that everybody laughed at?

858
00:55:21,278 --> 00:55:23,589
Yeah.
It makes no sense.

859
00:55:23,614 --> 00:55:26,101
- Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...
- Huh!

860
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,944
My whole life has been
building to this moment!

861
00:55:46,797 --> 00:55:48,027
Um.
It's a...

862
00:55:48,052 --> 00:55:49,861
Unicorn!

863
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:53,812
I can't believe it!

864
00:55:54,237 --> 00:55:56,829
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

865
00:55:57,018 --> 00:56:00,156
Oh, Lucky, stop it...

866
00:56:01,203 --> 00:56:04,160
Yeah.
I'll let someone else burst her bubble.

867
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:14,422
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist.

868
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:20,065
And that diamond will make us
the richest, most powerful villains in the world!

869
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,597
Right, Brother?

870
00:56:22,686 --> 00:56:25,757
Right.
Yeah. Yeah...

871
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:31,532
Bravo! Bravissimo!
You're amazing.

872
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:33,952
I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

873
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:36,186
- And you were always such a gentleman.
- You did it! You did it!

874
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:38,116
You got our jobs back.

875
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:46,707
Oh yeah. Right.
Sure.

876
00:56:46,732 --> 00:56:48,615
Oh look, we're here!

877
00:56:55,407 --> 00:56:57,836
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.

878
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:00,423
I still don't see
why I can't go with you.

879
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:01,977
Hey.
Hey, we discussed this.

880
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,456
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

881
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,268
Fine...

882
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,294
- Hey, brother.
- What?

883
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:24,058
 I told you, you were
supposed to stay with the boat!

884
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,978
Oh, I didn't think
you meant that literally.

885
00:57:27,003 --> 00:57:29,422
What other way
could I have meant it?

886
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:33,303
Alright. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

887
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:34,875
Got it.

888
00:57:38,274 --> 00:57:40,440
Help me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

889
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:42,485
Oh no!
The poison spikes!

890
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,173
 Oh, I'm gonna be impaled!

891
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:49,384
Ha ha!
I'm okay!

892
00:57:49,648 --> 00:57:51,585
I missed the Minions.

893
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,929
Come on!

894
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:00,442
Coming.

895
00:58:06,168 --> 00:58:07,671
Coming.

896
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:13,533
Come on.

897
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:20,808
It's a scanning device!

898
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,953
Quick... camouflage mode.

899
00:58:23,323 --> 00:58:25,300
Freeze!
And close your eyes.

900
00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:27,137
And cover your mouth!

901
00:58:32,903 --> 00:58:34,903
Okay.
Take my hand!

902
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,935
Ha ha.
Follow me!

903
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:18,822
Ha ha.

904
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,852
Look out!

905
00:59:29,726 --> 00:59:33,025
You're right.
I should've stay in the boat.

906
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:35,897
My stomach feels all queasy.

907
00:59:35,922 --> 00:59:39,761
I shouldn't have eaten
that hot pie.

908
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:42,654
Hey. Hey.
Relax.

909
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,520
You're going to be just fine.
I got your back.

910
00:59:52,678 --> 00:59:54,445
Come on, this way.

911
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,282
Gru would take this.
Gru would take that.

912
00:59:58,307 --> 00:59:59,895
Go, go, go!

913
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,730
Eh, Peter, that way.

914
01:00:01,755 --> 01:00:03,104
Oh, okay.

915
01:00:24,634 --> 01:00:26,312
Go, go.
Go, go, go.

916
01:00:39,087 --> 01:00:40,984
Huh?
Hey, come back.

917
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:54,337
Hello. Hello.
Hello.

918
01:01:00,965 --> 01:01:02,905
You jacket is located
within easy reach.

919
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,851
Inflate your jacket by pulling the toggle.
Like this...

920
01:01:05,883 --> 01:01:08,184
Thank for your attention,
enjoy your flight.

921
01:01:13,864 --> 01:01:17,730
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

922
01:01:19,238 --> 01:01:21,777
Bud-Buddy.
Bud-Buddy!

923
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,416
Buddy!!!

924
01:01:25,855 --> 01:01:27,601
It looks like
it's right above us.

925
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:30,201
Okay! What do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

926
01:01:30,226 --> 01:01:31,999
No.
Come with me.

927
01:01:47,557 --> 01:01:49,782
I'd like to thank the Academy.

928
01:01:52,128 --> 01:01:53,613
- I can...
- No no no no no...

929
01:01:53,638 --> 01:01:56,081
- Why? I can do it.
- Don't, don't, don't!

930
01:01:56,106 --> 01:01:59,250
Yes, yes, Molly Ringwald.
I will take you to the prom.

931
01:01:59,275 --> 01:02:02,289
What... Who… Where...
What... Who's there…?

932
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,846
Ninety nine red balloons...

933
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:14,699
Whoops!
Almost forgot.

934
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:27,610
Shh, shh.
Over here!

935
01:02:29,227 --> 01:02:30,765
Stay close.

936
01:02:35,207 --> 01:02:36,504
Dolls.

937
01:02:36,529 --> 01:02:40,388
Looks like Bratt was the only one
stupid enough to buy this junk.

938
01:02:40,413 --> 01:02:43,537
Oh.
I used to have one of these!

939
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:45,907
Pew pew pew!

940
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:48,884
Aaah!
Oww!

941
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:51,028
Hey! Shh!
Come on!

942
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:01,629
Alright.
We're getting close.

943
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:06,044
From now on, every move must be
made with ultra precision and purpose.

944
01:03:07,823 --> 01:03:09,063
Gum!

945
01:03:09,088 --> 01:03:10,496
Focus!

946
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,120
We're after the diamond,
not the bubble gum!

947
01:03:13,145 --> 01:03:14,810
Ah, got it.

948
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:19,102
Mmm.
Yum.

949
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:21,671
This way!

950
01:03:22,284 --> 01:03:25,591
And now to put this
where it belongs.

951
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,583
What?

952
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:31,222
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

953
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:40,051
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us.

954
01:03:42,221 --> 01:03:45,681
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

955
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,061
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!

956
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:56,112
Freeze, dipsticks!

957
01:03:56,137 --> 01:03:58,688
Gru!
There's two of you now?

958
01:03:58,713 --> 01:04:01,464
 Then this will be
twice as much fun.

959
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:10,307
Aaaaah!
Give me back my diamond!

960
01:04:10,332 --> 01:04:12,300
Total lockdown!!

961
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:14,487
 Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!!

962
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,867
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

963
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:32,582
Run!

964
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,129
Oh no…

965
01:04:40,154 --> 01:04:42,717
Oh no?
What does that mean?

966
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:45,850
ARE WE GONNA DIE??
ARE WE GONNA DIE??

967
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,765
WE'RE GONNA DIE!!

968
01:04:57,153 --> 01:04:58,372
What?

969
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:01,082
Hey, guys.
Hold on!

970
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:03,014
Lucy!

971
01:05:09,714 --> 01:05:12,491
Thank you for saving us!
Woo!

972
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:15,033
“Look! We got the diamond!
And we're going to...

973
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:18,775
Take it to the AVL
and get our job back!

974
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,578
Wait!

975
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:21,196
What?
That's amazing!

976
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:24,406
And the best part is
you are never ever

977
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:28,309
go behind my back ever again!

978
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:31,332
- Right, honeybear?
- Yup! Yup! Right.

979
01:05:31,357 --> 01:05:33,077
Lesson learned.

980
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,662
I'll get the girls and start packing
and tell them the good news!

981
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:50,876
Ah, we're getting
our jobs back, yeah!

982
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:53,378
Yes. Yes.
Go tell the girls.

983
01:05:54,499 --> 01:05:55,241
Dru.

984
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:58,355
No. No way!
We can't give the diamond back!

985
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,889
- I have to.
- No, you don't!

986
01:06:00,914 --> 01:06:02,925
- Yes, I do.
- Give it.

987
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,323
- No!
- Give it!

988
01:06:04,348 --> 01:06:06,240
Ow!
What is wrong with you?

989
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:07,567
What is wrong with you?

990
01:06:07,592 --> 01:06:08,528
You kicked me!

991
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:09,969
You-You lied to me.

992
01:06:09,994 --> 01:06:11,932
Hey.
I would have told you the truth.

993
01:06:11,957 --> 01:06:14,879
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

994
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,394
That's it, I'm out of here.

995
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:19,410
You have no right to take that,
we stole it together.

996
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:21,027
Together?

997
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:22,754
You got to be kidding me.

998
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,997
You did nothing but
screwed up the whole time.

999
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,757
I got this
in spite of you.

1000
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,771
Oh, yeah?
Well, at least I didn't get fired

1001
01:06:29,796 --> 01:06:32,158
from my job
like a total loser.

1002
01:06:32,183 --> 01:06:33,868
At least I had a job.

1003
01:06:33,893 --> 01:06:35,965
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

1004
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,170
I'll tell you what:
Nothing!

1005
01:06:39,392 --> 01:06:42,953
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

1006
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,775
We're no longer brothers!

1007
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,568
That's fine with me!

1008
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:34,668
Gru!
I found a unicorn!

1009
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:38,681
My life is complete!

1010
01:07:41,014 --> 01:07:45,861
Honey, that's...
that's not actually a unicorn.

1011
01:07:47,445 --> 01:07:51,096
But-But he has one horn.

1012
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:54,299
I'm-I'm sorry, sweetie,
but...

1013
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:57,138
he's just a goat.

1014
01:07:57,163 --> 01:08:00,278
Life is just like that sometimes.

1015
01:08:00,303 --> 01:08:02,735
We're hoping for a unicorn

1016
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,022
and we get a goat.

1017
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:08,968
Well, you know what?

1018
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:13,083
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

1019
01:08:13,108 --> 01:08:17,421
Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.

1020
01:08:21,735 --> 01:08:23,420
I'll take this.

1021
01:08:23,445 --> 01:08:26,540
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

1022
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:28,580
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

1023
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,412
Come on, girls, let's go!

1024
01:08:30,437 --> 01:08:34,539
Let's get physical, physical!

1025
01:08:41,155 --> 01:08:43,251
Change of plan, girls.

1026
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:45,436
Instead of going home...

1027
01:08:45,461 --> 01:08:47,632
Eyebrows.
Ow!

1028
01:08:47,764 --> 01:08:50,973
We're going to Hollywood!

1029
01:08:52,056 --> 01:08:55,078
Now that's what I call acting.

1030
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:59,373
Let's go, Clive.
We've got a giant robot waiting.

1031
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:03,217
Huh?

1032
01:09:04,212 --> 01:09:06,487
Huh?
Lucy?

1033
01:09:07,818 --> 01:09:09,542
Bratt, he took the girls!

1034
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:10,766
What?

1035
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,250
Dru!
Dru!

1036
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:18,986
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

1037
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:21,537
Bratt has the girls!

1038
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:29,692
Listen, brother.
What...

1039
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,989
- About what I said.
- No, I'm the one...

1040
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:33,779
But I shouldn't have...

1041
01:09:33,804 --> 01:09:36,089
I'm-I'm sorry.

1042
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:39,465
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1043
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:41,333
Awww.

1044
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:43,346
Oh, look out!

1045
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:44,968
What is that?

1046
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:47,672
Hey. Hey!
Infront!

1047
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:50,522
Caramba!
Caramba!

1048
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:53,203
CARAMBAAAAA!

1049
01:09:53,228 --> 01:09:54,416
Mel?

1050
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,180
Huh?
Gru?

1051
01:09:57,532 --> 01:10:00,081
Got to turn this thing around...

1052
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:01,790
Gru!

1053
01:10:01,815 --> 01:10:06,339
Wait for us.
GRUUUUU...

1054
01:10:30,218 --> 01:10:33,652
Hello, Hollywood!

1055
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:36,912
I'm back and bigger than ever.

1056
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:39,970
I'm scared!

1057
01:10:39,995 --> 01:10:42,727
Thank you.
Thank you so...

1058
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,875
You can't leave me here!

1059
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,507
I've paid this!

1060
01:10:52,244 --> 01:10:54,847
Clive, arm the cannons.

1061
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,739
Chew on this!

1062
01:11:16,215 --> 01:11:18,853
Hey, mullet-head.
Let us out!

1063
01:11:18,878 --> 01:11:20,877
Oh, don't worry, girls.

1064
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:24,471
I've prepared
a front row seat for you.

1065
01:11:40,211 --> 01:11:42,224
- Waaah!
- Agnes!

1066
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:46,973
Once again, I win
and Gru loses.

1067
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:49,331
Enjoy the show, girls.

1068
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:58,357
What in the heck?

1069
01:11:58,505 --> 01:12:00,346
I hope the girls are okay.

1070
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:01,386
Bratt!
Brother!

1071
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:03,662
9 o'clock. No.
3 o'clock.

1072
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,369
He's on the left!

1073
01:12:07,124 --> 01:12:09,488
Huh, no.
I've seen this episode.

1074
01:12:09,513 --> 01:12:11,145
He's going to bubble gum
the whole city

1075
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:13,294
and send it up into space.

1076
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:14,802
Hurry!

1077
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:27,361
This is it.
This is it.

1078
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:29,820
Lights!
Camera!

1079
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,719
LASER!

1080
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,465
Yeah.

1081
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:51,025
Look.
I got the girls.

1082
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:52,398
You two go
take care of Bratt.

1083
01:12:52,423 --> 01:12:54,445
Wait.
What are you doing?

1084
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,925
Look, you guys.
It's Lucy.

1085
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,335
Lucy, over here.
Help! Help us!

1086
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:06,169
Mama's coming, girls.

1087
01:13:06,194 --> 01:13:08,034
- Lucy!
- Right here!

1088
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:10,195
Look at that laser go.

1089
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,524
I love it when a
plan comes together.

1090
01:13:12,549 --> 01:13:15,320
Aaaah!
It's Gru!

1091
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:18,776
Get ready, Bratt.

1092
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:22,016
You're about to be blasted
back to the 80's.

1093
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:36,530
Ah ho!
We got him!

1094
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:46,225
- Oh no.
- Don't worry.

1095
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,298
There's more where that came from.

1096
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,938
It'll take more than
that to stop me.

1097
01:13:50,963 --> 01:13:53,867
Bratt pack,
go get that barf bag.

1098
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:03,915
Oh, incoming!

1099
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:06,335
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1100
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,863
You, little...

1101
01:14:15,088 --> 01:14:16,888
Quick!
Jump!

1102
01:14:18,995 --> 01:14:20,458
Boners!

1103
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:23,078
Did you see that, Clive?
All gone.

1104
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,285
Bye bye, Wonder Twins.

1105
01:14:43,556 --> 01:14:45,314
Whoa!
Ooh la la!

1106
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:47,456
What are all those bubbles?

1107
01:14:53,237 --> 01:14:54,650
Help!

1108
01:14:54,727 --> 01:14:55,830
Help!

1109
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:57,330
Hang on!

1110
01:15:04,686 --> 01:15:07,308
Hang on, girls!
I got you!

1111
01:15:07,385 --> 01:15:10,267
I can't.
I'm slipping!

1112
01:15:11,309 --> 01:15:13,207
No!

1113
01:15:14,478 --> 01:15:15,808
Gotcha.

1114
01:15:18,048 --> 01:15:19,438
Thank you, Lucy.

1115
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:21,969
Let's go!
We're not safe yet!

1116
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,962
Minions, time to do
what we do best.

1117
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:29,898
We will cheer for our boss.
We will fight for our boss.

1118
01:15:29,923 --> 01:15:31,678
We'll pop the bubbles!

1119
01:15:31,703 --> 01:15:32,960
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1120
01:15:32,985 --> 01:15:34,645
- Villain!
- Villain!

1121
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:37,659
You guys too!
You guys are villains!

1122
01:15:50,627 --> 01:15:52,843
Look at what we have here.

1123
01:15:52,868 --> 01:15:57,490
Sorry, Gru.
This is going to be a total burn.

1124
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,582
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no...

1125
01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:12,735
I've been a bad boy!

1126
01:16:20,177 --> 01:16:24,131
Nobody messes with my brother!

1127
01:16:26,925 --> 01:16:28,003
Aaaah!

1128
01:16:28,028 --> 01:16:29,650
Aaaaahh!

1129
01:16:35,192 --> 01:16:37,346
What?
What's happening?

1130
01:16:50,156 --> 01:16:52,216
Dru!

1131
01:16:52,503 --> 01:16:54,399
Hold on!
I'm coming!

1132
01:16:58,555 --> 01:17:01,143
You've ruined everything.

1133
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:03,655
And now, it's time to die.

1134
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,371
Any last words, Gru?

1135
01:17:06,593 --> 01:17:08,090
You know what?

1136
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:10,834
I got two words for you.

1137
01:17:11,405 --> 01:17:13,111
Dance fight.

1138
01:17:13,939 --> 01:17:17,662
Oh, it is alright, Donkey Kong.

1139
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:20,827
I'm going to enjoy this.

1140
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,329
Enough!

1141
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:43,051
My turn.

1142
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:04,453
Oh oh.

1143
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:09,507
Game over!

1144
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:15,210
Is this what you're looking for?

1145
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:16,626
No!

1146
01:18:17,063 --> 01:18:18,998
Ow. Ow.
Ow.

1147
01:18:26,282 --> 01:18:28,606
No...!

1148
01:18:31,754 --> 01:18:34,211
Curse you, Gru!

1149
01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:36,409
Curse you.

1150
01:18:36,434 --> 01:18:39,141
Bill, over there.
Robert, work your pick.

1151
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:40,936
Chuck, more bashing.

1152
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:46,427
Dru.

1153
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:47,716
Dru.

1154
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:57,342
Hey, we did it.

1155
01:18:57,705 --> 01:19:00,205
Yes, we did, brother.

1156
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:03,284
- Gru!
- Gru!

1157
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:18,039
Gru!

1158
01:19:18,064 --> 01:19:20,622
Hey, Mel.
Welcome back.

1159
01:19:20,647 --> 01:19:21,401
Woo-hooooo!

1160
01:19:21,426 --> 01:19:24,342
- Yay!
- Yay!

1161
01:19:53,586 --> 01:19:55,353
Love you, Mom.

1162
01:19:59,832 --> 01:20:03,107
I'm a Mom.
I'm a Mom!

1163
01:20:05,999 --> 01:20:08,206
Fight!
Ha ha!

1164
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:14,210
Ha ha ha...

1165
01:20:14,235 --> 01:20:15,732
Cheater!

1166
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:18,339
- How do you like this, Cheater?
- No. No.

1167
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,453
Boys.
Time for bed.

1168
01:20:21,478 --> 01:20:23,485
We're back at work
in the morning.

1169
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:26,782
- I'm coming, sweetie.
- Hi, Lucy.

1170
01:20:26,807 --> 01:20:28,523
See you tomorrow, brother.

1171
01:20:28,548 --> 01:20:31,804
Hey, I'm back on the job.
So no villainy tonight.

1172
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:33,001
Huh, got it?

1173
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:36,200
I make no promises.
Love you!

1174
01:20:36,225 --> 01:20:38,155
Uh-huh, right.

1175
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,019
I love you too.

1176
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,976
- Awwww.
- Awwww.

1177
01:20:42,817 --> 01:20:44,657
Alright, every...
Go. Go.

1178
01:20:44,682 --> 01:20:46,151
Go to bed.

1179
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:52,867
Hey. Guys.
Come on.

1180
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,481
- What is happening?
- It's coming from outside!

1181
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:18,919
Hey, I thought we said
no more villainy!

1182
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:20,248
Sorry, brother.

1183
01:21:20,273 --> 01:21:23,424
- Somebody's got to keep
the family tradition alive.
- Yoo-hoo.

1184
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:24,494
Right?

1185
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:26,722
- Yeah!
- Villain!

1186
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:28,599
- Yeah!
- Kumbaya!

1187
01:21:34,295 --> 01:21:35,955
Let's get him.

1188
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,656
Honey, he's my brother.

1189
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:41,267
We'll give him
a 5 minute head start.

1190
