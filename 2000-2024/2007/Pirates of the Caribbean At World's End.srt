duly appointed representative

By decree, according to martial law,

the following statutes
are temporarily amended.

Right to legal counsel: suspended.

Right to verdict by a jury of peers:

00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:40,976
suspended.

13
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:47,108
By decree,
all persons found guilty of piracy,

or aiding a person convicted of piracy,

15
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:54,698
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy

00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,662
shall be sentenced to hang

<i>The King and his men</i>

<i>Stole the Queen from her bed</i>

Lord Beckett.

34
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,029
They've started to sing, sir.

35
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,698
<i>Heave ho</i>

36
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,950
Finally.

37
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,119
<i>Thieves and beggars</i>

<i>Others sail on the sea</i>

<i>With the keys to the cage

42
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,092
<i>We lay to Fiddler's Green</i>

43
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:07,349
<i>The bell has been raised
From its watery grave</i>

44
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,811
<i>Hear its sepulchral tone</i>

45
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,192
<i>A call to all
Pay heed the squall</i>

46
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:30,164
<i>Turn your sails to home</i>

00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:35,753

<i>Thief and beggar</i>

51

<i>Never say we die</i>

52
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,688
A dangerous song to be singing

53
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,232
for any who are ignorant of its meaning.

54
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,277
Particularly a woman.

55
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,156
Particularly a woman alone.

56
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,701
What makes you think she's alone?

57
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,582
You protect her?

58
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,502
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

59
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,879
Your master's expecting us.

60
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:24,009
And an unexpected death would cast
a slight pall on our meeting.

61
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,491
Steady as she goes.

62
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,913
All right.

63
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,252
Have you heard anything from Will?

64
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,671
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts

65
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,049
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

66
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,552
Is he that terrifying?

67
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,682
He's much like myself but absent
my merciful nature and sense of fair play.

68
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,325
We're through. Make ready.

69
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,625
Hurry UP-

70
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,426
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

71
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,639
Well, when you put it that way...

72
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,684
Remove. Please.

73
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,896
Remove.

74
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,107
Please.

75
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,194
Captain Barbossa.

76
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,530
Welcome to Singapore.

77
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,202
More steam.

78
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,311
None of that. If things don't go
the way we want,

79
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,938
then we're the only chance they've got.

80
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:57,866
I understand that you have a request
to make of me.

81
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,244
More of a proposal to put to ye.

82
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:06,625
I have a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

83
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,505
It's an odd coincidence.

84
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,675
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

85
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,635
No.

86
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,554
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

87
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,892
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

88
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,270
and tried to make off with these.

89
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,692
The navigational charts.

90
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,946
The route to the Farthest Gate.

91
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,744
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours

92
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,206
took you to the world beyond this one?

93
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,334
It would strain credulity at that.

94
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,975
This is the thief.

95
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,729
Is his face familiar to you?

96
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,401
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

97
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:30,083
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

98
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,628
- Sao Feng, I assure you, I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

99
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,511
You intend to attempt a voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

100
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,764
But I cannot help but wonder...

101
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,267
...why?

102
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,528
The song has been sung.

103
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,616
The time is upon us.

104
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,119
We must convene the Brethren Court.

105
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,831
As one of the nine pirate lords,

106
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,626
you must honour the call.

107
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,545
More steam.

108
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,554
More steam!

109
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,564
There is a price on all our heads.

110
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,274
It is true.

111
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,611
It seems the only way
a pirate can turn a profit any more

112
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,658
is by betraying other pirates.

113
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,662
- It be time to put our differences aside.
- Wait for the signal.

114
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,456
The first Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

115
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,167
- It's Elizabeth.
- Now that rule is being challenged

116
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,670
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

117
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,047
Against the East India Trading Company

118
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,384
what value is the Brethren Court?

119
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,302
What can any of us do?

120
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,221
You can fight.

121
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,725
Get off me. You are Sao Feng,
the Pirate Lord of Singapore.

122
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:15,939
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

123
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,984
Where waves aren't measured in feet
but as increments of fear,

124
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,362
and those who pass the test
become legend.

125
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,198
Would you have that era come to an end
on your watch?

126
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,995
The most notorious pirates from around
the world are uniting against our enemy

127
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,623
and yet you sit here cowering
in your bathwater.

128
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,464
Elizabeth Swann,

129
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,635
there is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

130
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,973
And the eye does not go wanting.

131
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:57,022
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

132
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,610
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

133
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,861
Jack Sparrow.

134
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,949
He's one of the pirate lords.

135
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,373
The only reason

136
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,962
I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead

137
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:25,216
is so I can send him back myself!

138
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,433
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

139
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,686
He failed to pass it along to a successor
before he died.

140
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,648
So we must go and get him back.

141
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:50,742
So you admit you have deceived me.

142
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:51,993
Weapons!

143
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,998
Weapons!

144
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,211
Sao Feng, I assure you our intentions
are strictly honourable.

145
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,096
Drop your weapons, or I kill the man.

146
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,308
Kill him. He's not our man.

147
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,313
If he's not with you, and he's not with us,

148
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,857
who's he with?

149
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,716
Will!

150
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,820
Ready!

151
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,448
Fire!

152
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,292
Chart!

153
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,919
- Come on, men.
- Come on, lads.

154
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,242
Men, make ready! Set!

155
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,494
Fire!

156
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:09,130
Company, make ready! Set!

157
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,758
Fire!

158
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,944
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it'?

159
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,949
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

160
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,450
It is coincidence only.

161
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,041
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

162
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,545
You crossed Barbossa.

163
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,755
You were willing
to cross Jack Sparrow.

164
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,883
Why should I expect any better?

165
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,095
I need the <i>Black Pearl</i> to free my father.

166
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,766
You are helping me to get it.

167
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,284
Fire in the hole.

168
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,511
Thank you, Jack.

169
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,889
Thank you, Jack.

170
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,267
You have the charts?

171
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,727
And better yet:

172
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,854
a ship and a crew.

173
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,105
Where's Sao Feng?

174
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,733
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

175
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,693
This way. Be quick.

176
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,086
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

177
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,006
Do you think he will honour the call?

178
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,800
I cannot say.

179
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,595
There's an evil on these seas

180
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:26,309
that even the most staunch
and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

181
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,253
A piece of eight.

182
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,796
Nine of them you say.

183
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,634
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir. Nine pieces of eight.

184
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,137
What's the significance of that,
I wonder?

185
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,056
Does it matter? There's nothing
can hold against the armada,

186
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,975
<i>not with the Flying Dutchman at the</i> lead.

187
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,518
Nothing we know of.

188
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,815
Did your friend happen to mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

189
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,067
He was mum on that, sir.

190
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,864
Then he knows
the value of information.

191
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,991
Better keep this between ourselves.

192
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,995
We don't want anyone running off
to Singapore, do we?

193
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,290
Admiral.

194
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,959
You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

195
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,962
Yes. Something for you there.

196
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:22,050
Your new station deserves
an old friend.

197
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,190
Not more requisition orders.

198
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,610
No, sir. Execution.

199
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,992
The Brethren know they face extinction.

200
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:54,082
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

201
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,609
No one said anything about cold.

202
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:26,155
I'm sure there must be a good reason
for our suffering.

203
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,533
Why don't that obeah woman
just bring Jack back

204
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,535
the same way
she brought back Barbossa?

205
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,455
Because Barbossa was only dead.

206
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:39,335
Jack Sparrow is taken, in body and soul

207
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:44,841
to a place not of death but punishment.

208
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,469
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself,

209
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,222
stretching on forever.

210
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,393
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

211
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,606
Yeah.

212
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,484
I knew there was a good reason.

213
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,164
Nothing here is set.

214
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,293
These can't be as accurate
as modern charts.

215
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,380
No, but it leads to more places.

216
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,596
"Over the edge.

217
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,265
Over again."

218
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,688
"Sunrise sets. Flash of green."

219
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,069
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

220
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:52,450
Ever gazed upon
the green flash, Master Gibbs?

221
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,827
I reckon I seen my fair share.

222
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,205
Happens on rare occasion.

223
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,708
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

224
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,544
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

225
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:07,006
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

226
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:11,260
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

227
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,141
Sorry.

228
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,727
Trust me, young Master Turner,

229
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,314
it's not getting to the land of the dead
that's the problem.

230
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,859
It's getting back.

231
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:13,447
- Full sail. Take to wind. Luff the sails.
- Aye, aye, sir.

232
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,161
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

233
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,873
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

234
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,459
Fetch the chest.

235
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,753
And the governor?

236
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,508
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

237
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,011
Does he know?

238
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:42,059
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

239
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,427
Steady, men.

240
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,102
Go. All of you.

241
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,355
And take that infernal thing with you.

242
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,233
I will not have it on my ship.

243
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,861
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Because I will.

244
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,407
Because it seems to be the only way
to ensure that this ship do

245
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,368
as directed by the Company.

246
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,084
We need prisoners to interrogate,

247
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,212
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

248
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:37,216
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

249
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:42,513
And its captain is to sail it
as commanded.

250
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,810
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

251
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:52,481
This is no longer your world, Jones.

252
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:57,445
The immaterial has become

253
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,572
immaterial.

254
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,701
Charge your bayonets.

255
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,492
How long do we continue not talking?

256
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,664
Once we rescue Jack,
everything will be fine.

257
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,211
Then we rescue Jack.

258
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,615
For what we want most

259
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,036
there is a cost must be paid in the end.

260
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,216
Barbossa, ahead.

261
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,219
Aye, we're good and lost now.

262
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:46,887
Lost?

263
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,724
For certain you have to be lost
to find a place as can't be found.

264
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,519
Elseways, everyone would know
where it was.

265
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,689
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

266
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,233
To stations.

267
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,151
All hands to stations!

268
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,074
Rudder full. Hard aport. Gather way.

269
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:11,954
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

270
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:14,957
Blimey.

271
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:32,641
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

272
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,102
You may not survive
to pass this way again

273
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:39,315
and these be
the last friendly words you'll hear.

274
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,321
Tie her off.

275
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,953
Hard to port!

276
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,130
Hold on!

277
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,874
<i>Strike your colours,
you blooming cockroaches.</i>

278
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,417
<i>Show them your larboard side.</i>

279
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:46,465
<i>Dead men tell no tales</i>

280
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,889
My peanut.

281
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,934
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

282
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,020
Aye, captain. Slacken braces.

283
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,814
- Step lively, with a will.
- Aye, aye.

284
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,650
- Right away, sir.
- I'm on the fly down below.

285
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:54,199
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

286
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,216
Haul the sheets handsomely, boys.
Scandalise the lateens.

287
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,927
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

288
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,068
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, captain.

289
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,571
What say you about the condition
of this tack line?

290
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,074
It be proper to my eyes, sir.

291
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,909
Proper?

292
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,537
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

293
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,207
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

294
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,710
Begging your pardon, sir, but perhaps
if you gave a man another chance.

295
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,046
Shall I?

296
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:56,095
That sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

297
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,683
We have lost speed
and, therefore, time.

298
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:06,063
Precious time
which cannot be recovered once lost.

299
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,107
- Do you understand?
- Aye, aye, captain.

300
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,650
Aye, aye, captain.

301
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,610
Do you, now?

302
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,738
It will all have to be redone. All of it.

303
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,741
And let this serve as a lesson
to the lot of you.

304
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,203
Doldrums, sir.
Has the entire crew on edge.

305
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,956
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots

306
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,459
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

307
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,799
Gentlemen,
I wash my hands of this weirdness.

308
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,353
No wind.

309
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,147
Of course there's no bloody wind.

310
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,484
My soul, I do swear, for a breeze.

311
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:57,739
A gust. A whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

312
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,379
Yes, sir, I know. But why?
Why would he do that?

313
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,089
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

314
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:18,302
We shall have a magnificent garden party,
and you're not invited.

315
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,150
Shoo.

316
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,629
A rock.

317
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:24,076
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

318
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,163
A rope.

319
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,432
This truly is a godforsaken place.

320
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,811
I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone.

321
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,772
He's here.

322
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,275
Davy Jones never once gave up
that what he took.

323
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,735
And does it matter?

324
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:07,155
We're trapped here by your doing,
no different than Jack.

325
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:16,164
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

326
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,289
Impossible.

327
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,087
Boat.

328
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:14,931
Slap me thrice and hand me to me mama.
It's Jack.

329
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,067
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

330
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,402
- Hide the rum.
- Jack.

331
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,612
Mr. Gibbs.

332
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,780
- Aye, captain.
- I thought so.

333
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,492
I expect you're able to account
for your actions, then.

334
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,743
Sir?

335
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,622
There has been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

336
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,081
Why is that, sir?

337
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,000
Sir, you're...

338
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,920
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, captain.

339
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,550
I know that.

340
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,762
I know where I am.
And don't think I don't.

341
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,723
Jack Sparrow.

342
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,808
Hector.

343
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,810
It's been too long, hasn't it?

344
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:05,649
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

345
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,944
No, I didn't.

346
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,780
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

347
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:15,700
You add an agreeable
sense of the macabre to any delirium.

348
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,286
He thinks we're a hallucination.

349
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,248
William, tell me something.

350
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,960
Have you come because you need my
help to save a certain distressing damsel?

351
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,837
Rather, damsel in distress?

352
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,173
- Either one.
- No.

353
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,927
Well, then you wouldn't be here,
would you? So you can't be here.

354
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,846
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

355
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,139
Jack.

356
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,561
This is real. We're here.

357
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,366
- The Locker you say?
- Aye.

358
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,660
We've come to rescue you.

359
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,997
Have you now?

360
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,207
That's very kind of you.

361
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,460
But it would seem that as I possess
a ship and you don't,

362
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:11,423
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

363
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,883
I see my ship.

364
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,803
Right there.

365
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,099
Can't spot it.

366
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:24,269
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

367
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:28,815
Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy
Jones. He controls the <i>Flying</i> Dutchman.

368
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:32,068
- He's taking over the seas.
- The song has already been sung.

369
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,737
The Brethren Court is called.

370
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,365
Leave you people alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

371
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,993
Aye, Jack. The world needs you back
something fierce.

372
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,203
And you need a crew.

373
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,291
Why should I sail with any of you?

374
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,754
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

375
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,010
She's not told you.

376
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,929
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

377
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:02,724
As for you...

378
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:10,690
Now, don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

379
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,817
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

380
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:14,944
Don't need you. You scare me.

381
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,114
Gibbs, you can come. Marty.

382
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,951
Cotton.
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy.

383
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,997
But at least I'll have someone to talk to.

384
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,293
- Who are you?
- Tai Huang. These are my men.

385
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,046
Where do your allegiances lie?

386
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,506
With the highest bidder.

387
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,424
I have a ship.

388
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,635
That makes you the highest bidder.

389
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,136
Good man.

390
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:43,973
Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

391
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,187
Jack.

392
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,067
Which way you going, Jack?

393
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:59,698
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

394
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,325
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul that pennant line.

395
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,536
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

396
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,955
- No, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

397
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,500
- No, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

398
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:14,546
- Captain gives orders on a ship.
- The captain of the ship is giving orders.

399
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,632
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

400
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,135
That makes you "chart-man."

401
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:25,765
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?

402
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:34,023
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

403
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,152
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

404
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,154
Sorry.

405
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,869
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah.

406
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,198
You left Jack to the Kraken.

407
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,534
He's rescued now. It's done with.

408
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,831
Will, I had no choice.

409
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,834
You chose not to tell me.

410
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,878
I couldn't.

411
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,839
It wasn't your burden to bear.

412
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,343
But I did bear it, didn't I?

413
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,971
I just didn't know what it was.

414
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:48,681
I thought...

415
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,560
You thought I loved him.

416
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:04,239
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

417
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,494
You can't.

418
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,107
Eerie

419
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,193
That's downright macabre.

420
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:52,036
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them.

421
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,548
Be disrespectful it would.

422
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:08,469
They should be in the care of Davy Jones.

423
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,557
That was the duty
him was charged with

424
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,977
by the goddess Calypso.

425
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,524
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

426
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:29,782
And every ten years,
him could come ashore

427
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,536
to be with she who love him.

428
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,496
Truly.

429
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,878
But the man has become a monster.

430
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:46,841
So he wasn't always tentacle-y?

431
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,136
No.

432
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:53,848
Him was a man.

433
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,809
Once.

434
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,652
Now there's boats coming.

435
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,661
They're not a threat to us.

436
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,245
Am I right?

437
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,915
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

438
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,334
It's best just let them be.

439
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,142
It's my father. We've made it back.

440
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,646
Father! Father, here! Look here!

441
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:44,524
Elizabeth.

442
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,276
We're not back.

443
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,285
Father!

444
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,539
Elizabeth.

445
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,250
Are you dead?

446
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,669
No. No.

447
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,380
I think I am.

448
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,590
No, you can't be.

449
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,428
There was this chest, you see.

450
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,763
It's odd.

451
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,890
At the time, it seemed so important.

452
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:19,809
Come aboard.

453
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,644
And a heart.

454
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:26,983
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place

455
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:30,987
and you will sail the seas for eternity.

456
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,407
The Dutchman must have a captain.

457
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,035
Silly thing to die for.

458
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:41,039
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

459
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:48,546
A touch of destiny.

460
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,468
Take the line.

461
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:59,182
- I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.
- The line! Take the line!

462
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:06,022
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

463
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,441
Please come with us! Please!

464
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,401
I won't leave you!

465
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,155
- I'll give your love to your mother, shall I?
- Please, I won't let you go!

466
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,823
Elizabeth.

467
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,083
Is there a way?

468
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,798
Him at peace.

469
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
No water.

470
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,310
Why is all but the rum gone?

471
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,896
Rum's gone too.

472
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:59,408
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

473
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:03,371
I fear we will sail on trackless seas

474
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:08,709
doomed to roam the reach
between worlds forever.

475
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:12,588
With no water, forever looks
to be arriving a mite too soon.

476
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,924
Why doesn't he do something?

477
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:18,136
- Me eye. Give it back.
- There's no sense to it.

478
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:22,890
And the green flash happens at sunset,
not sunrise.

479
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,101
Over the edge.

480
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,104
It's driving me over the blooming edge.

481
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:31,023
Sunrises don't set.

482
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,654
"Up is down."

483
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:39,740
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

484
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,492
Why are these things never clear?

485
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,162
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What?

486
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,167
Stab the heart.

487
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,003
- Don't stab the heart.
- Come again?

488
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,838
The Dutchman must have a captain.

489
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,340
Well, that's even more
than less than unhelpful.

490
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:59,260
Sail the seas for eternity.

491
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,013
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

492
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:06,017
- I prefer rum. Rum's good.
- Making port.

493
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,604
Where we can get rum
and salty wenches

494
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,647
once every ten years.

495
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,692
- What did he say'?
- Once every ten years.

496
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,028
Ten years is a long time, mate.

497
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,071
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

498
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,741
But eternity is longer still.

499
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,203
And how will you be spending it?
Dead?

500
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,624
- Or not?
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.

501
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,209
I like that.

502
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:34,337
Come sunset, it won't matter.

503
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,217
Not sunset.

504
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,304
Sundown.

505
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,682
And rise. Up.

506
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,644
What's that?

507
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,191
What is that? I don't know.
What do you think?

508
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,442
- Where?
- There.

509
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,549
What is it?

510
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,604
He's rocking the ship.

511
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,439
We're rocking the ship.

512
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,446
Aye. He's onto it.

513
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:48,035
- He's rocking the ship.
- We'll tie each other to the mast,

514
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:52,206
upside down so when the boat flips,
we'll be the right way up.

515
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,126
Time it with the swell.

516
00:54:56,002 --> 00:55:00,923
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

517
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,676
Unstow the cargo.

518
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,261
Let it shift.

519
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,327
Now up

520
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,246
is down.

521
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,219
This was your idea.

522
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,307
Blessed sweet Westerlies.

523
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,602
We're back.

524
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,564
It's the sunrise.

525
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,704
Paﬂey.

526
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:21,248
We need our pistols. Get untied. Hurry.

527
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,098
All right, then!

528
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,310
The Brethren Court is gathering
at Shipwreck Cove.

529
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,064
And, Jack, you and I are going,
and there will be no arguing that point.

530
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,275
I is arguing the point.
If there's pirates gathering,

531
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,236
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

532
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,739
The pirates are gathering to fight Beckett,
and you're a pirate.

533
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,116
Fight or not, you're not running, Jack.

534
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,036
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one

535
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,747
till there will be none left but you.

536
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:07,294
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

537
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:08,963
Aye.

538
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,090
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.

539
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,259
How does that figure into your plan?

540
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,678
I'm still working on that.

541
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,514
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate.

542
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,099
Count on that.

543
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:26,897
Wet powder.

544
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:33,946
Wait!
We can still use them as clubs!

545
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:38,242
Sorry. Effective, though.

546
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:41,245
There's a freshwater spring
on this island.

547
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,707
We can resupply there
and get back to shooting each other later.

548
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,668
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

549
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,588
I'll not be leaving my ship
in your command.

550
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:54,842
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command?

551
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:56,802
Temporarily.

552
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,031
Mind the boat.

553
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:30,878
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins.

554
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,940
Careful. Careful.

555
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,902
You stupid fish.

556
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,279
Actually, it's a cephalopod.

557
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:58,697
Serves you right.

558
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:02,076
Hey, I bet
people would pay a shilling to see this.

559
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,787
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

560
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,873
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

561
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:11,043
We could serve up a slice as a souvenir.

562
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,254
Still thinking of running, Jack?

563
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,633
Think you can outrun the world?

564
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:26,433
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything,

565
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,977
by and by there be none left at all.

566
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,440
Sometimes things come back, mate.

567
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,401
We're living proof, you and me.

568
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:39,196
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

569
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,241
There's never a guarantee
of coming back.

570
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,703
But passing on, that's dead certain.

571
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:51,709
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

572
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,335
It's our only hope, lad.

573
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,674
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

574
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,720
The world used to be a bigger place.

575
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,349
The world's still the same.

576
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,895
There's just less in it.

577
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:37,045
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

578
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:39,923
Hey, I know him.

579
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,551
He was in Singapore.

580
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,387
- Singapore.
- Captain!

581
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:52,311
We got company!

582
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,573
He's the captain.

583
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:21,215
Sao Feng, you showing up here
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

584
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,512
Jack Sparrow.

585
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,431
You pay me great insult once.

586
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,683
That doesn't sound like me.

587
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,065
Shall we just call it square, then?

588
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:40,108
Release her.

589
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,778
She's not part of the bargain.

590
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,613
And what bargain be that?

591
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,241
You heard Captain Turner.

592
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:50,202
Release her!

593
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,453
Captain Turner?

594
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:54,206
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

595
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,875
I need the <i>Pearl</i> to free my father.

596
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,419
That's the only reason I came
on this voyage.

597
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,298
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

598
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,050
It was my burden to bear.

599
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,804
He needs the Pearl.

600
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,431
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

601
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,225
And you felt guilty.

602
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,436
And you and your Brethren Court.

603
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:19,731
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

604
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,617
I'm standing over there with them.

605
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,580
I'm sorry, Jack,

606
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,250
but there is an old friend
who wants to see you first.

607
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,920
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

608
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,967
Here is your chance to find out.

609
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:57,603
Curious.

610
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,356
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

611
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:05,152
Perhaps they no longer believe
that a gathering of squabbling pirates

612
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,529
<i>can defeat the Flying Dutchman.</i>

613
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:12,075
And so despair leads to betrayal.

614
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:17,039
But you and I are no strangers to betrayal,
are we?

615
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,375
It's not here, Jack.

616
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,211
What? What isn't?

617
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,799
The heart of Davy Jones
is safely aboard the Dutchman

618
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:33,680
and so unavailable for use as leverage
to satisfy your debt to the good captain.

619
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:37,100
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

620
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,144
By your death?

621
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,271
And yet here you are.

622
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:46,568
Close your eyes and pretend
it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by.

623
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:51,031
And if Davy Jones were to learn
of your survival?

624
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,700
Ship ho!

625
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:56,078
Be on your guard, men.

626
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,624
My men are crew enough.

627
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,960
Company ship, Company crew.

628
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,964
<i>You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.</i>

629
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:10,050
And so it was.

630
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:15,013
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement,

631
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:19,017
one which requires
absolutely nothing from you

632
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,770
but information.

633
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,611
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.

634
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,905
In exchange for fair compensation?

635
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:35,617
Square my debt with Jones,

636
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,869
guarantee my freedom.

637
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,454
Of course.

638
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,456
It's just good business.

639
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,919
Were I in a divulgatory mood

640
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:48,380
what then might I divulge?

641
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,007
Everything.

642
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:51,341
Where are they meeting?

643
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,970
Who are the pirate lords?

644
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,306
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

645
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:09,693
Beckett agreed
the <i>Black Pearl</i> was to be mine.

646
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:14,156
Lord Beckett's not gonna give up the only
ship that can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

647
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:25,167
Shame they're not bound to honour the
code of the Brethren, isn't it?

648
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,211
Because honour's a hard thing
to come by nowadays.

649
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:32,382
There is no honour to remaining
with the losing side.

650
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:36,720
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

651
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,764
The losing side, you say?

652
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,766
They have the Dutchman.

653
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,018
<i>Now the Pearl!</i>

654
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,395
And what do the Brethren have?

655
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:49,608
We have Calypso.

656
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,118
Calypso.

657
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:03,747
An old legend.

658
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:09,211
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

659
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:15,300
Imagine all the powers of seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

660
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,636
I intend to release her.

661
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,764
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

662
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,851
All the Court.

663
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,063
You can keep Barbossa,

664
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:32,067
the belligerent homunculus and his friend
with the wooden eye both.

665
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,569
And Turner. Especially Turner.

666
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:38,115
The rest go with me aboard the Pearl,
and I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove

667
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:42,494
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

668
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,329
Bloody fair deal, don't you think?

669
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,040
And what becomes of Miss Swann?

670
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,671
What interest is she to you?

671
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,550
What are you proposing, captain?

672
01:08:56,758 --> 01:09:00,512
What be accepted, captain?

673
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,807
- The girl.
- What?

674
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:07,686
Jack, I've just recalled.

675
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:12,983
I've got this wonderful compass
which points to whatever I want.

676
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,777
So for what do I need you?

677
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,863
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

678
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:19,906
Out of the question.

679
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,867
It was not a question.

680
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:25,996
Points to the thing you want most.
And that is not the Brethren Court, is it?

681
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,123
Then what is, Jack?

682
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,168
Me. Dead.

683
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,087
- Done.
- What?

684
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:36,131
- Not done.
- You got us into this.

685
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,757
If this frees us, then done.

686
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,801
Damn.

687
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,307
Although, if I kill you,

688
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:51,730
then I can use the compass
to find Shipwreck Cove, is it, on my own.

689
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,191
Cut out the middleman, as it were.

690
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:55,984
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

691
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:59,654
I have had more than enough experience
dealing with pirates.

692
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:03,116
Then we have an accord.

693
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:10,415
With me killed, you'd arrive at the Cove,
find it a stronghold nigh impregnable,

694
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:14,252
able to withstand blockade for years,
and then you'd be wishing:

695
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:17,756
"Oh, if only there was someone
I had not killed inside

696
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:22,177
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

697
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,221
And you can accomplish all this,
can you?

698
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,683
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

699
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:29,976
Who am I?

700
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,064
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

701
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,069
Done.

702
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:28,743
You're mad.

703
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:33,206
Thank goodness for that, because
if I wasn't, this would probably never work.

704
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,101
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

705
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:05,613
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cow-hearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

706
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,451
Which ship do we follow?

707
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:14,164
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

708
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:18,209
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

709
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:23,131
She's coming down!

710
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:29,721
Do you think he plans it all out

711
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,891
or just makes it up as he goes along?

712
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,315
By this time tomorrow,
we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove

713
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:23,650
and you will be free.

714
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,487
Calypso.

715
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,073
Excuse me?

716
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:35,745
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have,

717
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,831
but it is what we call you.

718
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:40,959
We being who?

719
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:48,007
You confirm it.

720
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,468
Confirm what?

721
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:52,720
You've told me nothing.

722
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,723
The Brethren Court, not I.

723
01:13:56,307 --> 01:14:01,396
The first Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed,

724
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,773
they bound you to human form

725
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:07,026
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man, and not...

726
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,862
To me.

727
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:16,703
But one such as you should never be
anything less than what you are.

728
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,872
Pretty speech from a captor,

729
01:14:19,414 --> 01:14:22,959
but words whispered through prison bars
lose their charm.

730
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,172
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

731
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:32,510
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

732
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,347
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

733
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:40,310
I offer simply my desire.

734
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:42,896
And in return?

735
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:46,316
I would have your gifts

736
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,984
should you choose to give them.

737
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,075
And if I should choose not?

738
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,954
Then I will take

739
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,208
your fury.

740
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:29,150
Sao Feng?

741
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,903
Here.

742
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,905
Please.

743
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:43,373
With all nine pieces of eight,

744
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,127
you will be free.

745
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,922
Take it!

746
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,092
You are captain now.

747
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,302
Me?

748
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:04,185
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

749
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:08,231
Captain, the ship is taken. We cannot-

750
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:13,236
Forgive me, Calypso.

751
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,795
What did he tell you?

752
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,635
He made me captain.

753
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,640
Fire!

754
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,522
You are not my captain.

755
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:50,940
Elizabeth.

756
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,401
James. James.

757
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,408
Thank God, you're alive.

758
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,703
Your father will be overjoyed
to know you're safe.

759
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,204
My father's dead.

760
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:08,458
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

761
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,377
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

762
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,465
Who among you
do you name as captain?

763
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,008
Captain. Her.

764
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:24,724
- Captain?
- Tow the ship.

765
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,476
Put the prisoners in the brig.

766
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:29,687
The captain shall have my quarters.

767
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,774
Thank you, sir.

768
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,443
But I prefer to remain with my crew.

769
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:38,571
Elizabeth, I swear

770
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,241
- I did not know.
- Know what?

771
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,577
Which side you chose?

772
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,712
Well, now you do.

773
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:03,971
Bootstrap?

774
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:15,942
Bootstrap. Bill Turner?

775
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:17,694
Bootstrap.

776
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,455
You know my name.

777
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:33,793
Yes. I know your son.

778
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,797
Will Turner.

779
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,049
William.

780
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,349
He made it. He's alive.

781
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:53,020
And now he sends you
to tell me that he's coming to get me.

782
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:57,066
God's wounds. He's on his way.

783
01:18:57,275 --> 01:18:59,610
Yes, Will is alive.

784
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,654
And he wants to help you.

785
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,496
He can't help me. He won't come.

786
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,249
But you're his father.

787
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,793
I know you.

788
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,337
He spoke of you.

789
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:24,010
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

790
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:25,344
Me?

791
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:28,681
You're Elizabeth.

792
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,309
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

793
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:38,107
If Jones be slain, he who slays him
must take his place.

794
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,403
Captain forever.

795
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:48,034
The Dutchman must always
have a captain.

796
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,745
And if he saves me,

797
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,247
he loses you.

798
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,085
I see.

799
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,839
He won't pick me.

800
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:04,884
I wouldn't pick me.

801
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:10,890
Tell him not to come.

802
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:15,770
Tell him to stay away.

803
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,981
Tell him it's too late.

804
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:23,277
I'm already a part of the ship.

805
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:26,781
And the crew.

806
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,450
Bootstrap.

807
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,413
You know my name.

808
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,917
You know my name.

809
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:40,294
Yes, I know your son.

810
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:43,005
William.

811
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,427
He's coming for me.

812
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:50,555
Wait and see.

813
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,807
You'll see.

814
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:56,227
He promised.

815
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:14,245
Swing her over.

816
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,123
Ready those lines.

817
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:29,719
Sir.

818
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:34,891
A breadcrumb trail.

819
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,268
And we're meant to follow.

820
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,604
A betrayer among them?

821
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,105
Ur a trap?

822
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:44,609
A gambit by a skilled opponent.

823
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,696
Adjust course, lieutenant.

824
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:50,406
Sir?

825
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:56,203
We can only hope to reach our destination
before they run out of bodies.

826
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:13,679
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

827
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:17,308
William, do you notice anything?

828
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:23,898
Rather, do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

829
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:27,944
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

830
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,195
Not as odd as this.

831
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,115
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

832
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:36,160
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

833
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,996
This is what you've arrived at?

834
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:42,375
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust?

835
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,085
Accomplish your own ends?

836
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,796
It's like you don't know me at all, mate.

837
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:52,343
And how does your dearly beloved feel
about this plan?

838
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,724
You've not seen fit to trust her with it.

839
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,646
I'm losing her, Jack.

840
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:08,317
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

841
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,946
Mate, if you choose to lock
your heart away, you'll lose her for certain.

842
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:15,700
Now, if I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket,

843
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:18,869
avoid the choice altogether.

844
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:21,789
Change the facts.

845
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:25,334
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

846
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:27,294
Who?

847
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,676
You?

848
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:38,514
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

849
01:23:38,723 --> 01:23:41,809
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

850
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,728
your father goes free from his debt,

851
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,147
you're free to be with
your charming murderess.

852
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:50,234
And you're willing to out out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman?

853
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:51,527
Forever?

854
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:52,778
No, mate.

855
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:54,989
I'm free forever.

856
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,617
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map, free from death itself.

857
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:01,203
You have to do the job, though, Jack.

858
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:04,665
You have to ferry souls
to the next world

859
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:07,626
or end up just like Jones.

860
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,422
I don't have the face for tentacles.

861
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,469
But immortal has to count
for something, eh?

862
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,057
What's this for?

863
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:24,143
Think like me. It'll come to you.

864
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:39,533
My regards to Davy Jones.

865
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,373
I hate him.

866
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,922
Come with me.

867
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:56,801
Quickly.

868
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,019
What are you doing?

869
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,731
Choosing a side.

870
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,129
Quickly.

871
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:39,218
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

872
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:42,054
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

873
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:45,266
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

874
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:49,145
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

875
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,692
That does not absolve me
of my other sins.

876
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:00,114
Come with us.

877
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,077
James, come with me.

878
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,038
Who goes there?

879
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,668
Go. I Will follow.

880
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,338
You're lying.

881
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,385
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth,

882
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:25,639
but never joined.

883
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,106
Go now.

884
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:42,323
Back to your station, sailor.

885
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,534
No one leaves the ship.

886
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:47,494
Stand down.

887
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,787
That's an order.

888
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:51,248
That's an order.

889
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,293
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

890
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,128
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

891
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:58,297
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.
- Steady.

892
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:02,551
Part of the crew, part of the ship.
All hands, prisoner escape!

893
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,137
- Belay that!
- James!

894
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,113
James! No!

895
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:34,959
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

896
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,044
- Admiral's dead.
- The admiral's dead.

897
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,341
- To the captain's cabin!
- Aye!

898
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,927
- Captain's cabin.
- The captain's cabin.

899
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,808
James Norrington, do you fear death?

900
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,444
I take that as a no.

901
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,951
Nice sword.

902
01:28:29,555 --> 01:28:35,019
The Dutchman
is under my command.

903
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:39,356
For now.

904
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,082
Look alive
and keep a weather eye.

905
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,376
Not for nought
it's called Shipwreck Island

906
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:02,921
where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the Town of Shipwreck.

907
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,799
You heard him. Step lively.

908
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:09,511
You know, for all that pirates are
clever cogs, we are an unimaginative lot

909
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,097
- when it comes to naming things.
- Right.

910
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:16,352
I once sailed with a geezer,
lost both of his arms, part of his eye.

911
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,437
What'd you call him?

912
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:20,939
Larry.

913
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,904
I do not renege on a bargain
once struck

914
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,073
but we agreed on ends only.

915
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,242
The means are mine to decide.

916
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:34,578
Caution, Barbossa.

917
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:39,124
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead

918
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:43,212
or what it mean if you fail me.

919
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:48,967
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back,

920
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:53,097
why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

921
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,725
It took nine pirate lords to bind you,
Calypso,

922
01:29:56,934 --> 01:30:00,062
and it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

923
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,940
Masters Pintel, Ragetti.

924
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:07,778
Take this fishwife to the brig.

925
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:12,074
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

926
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:43,063
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

927
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:45,774
Apparently, you can.

928
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:47,401
I believe you know each other.

929
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:56,118
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

930
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,911
Not yours.

931
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,580
His.

932
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:02,082
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

933
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,210
Sparrow?

934
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,255
You didn't tell him?

935
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:11,925
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the <i>Black</i> Pearl.

936
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:15,012
What else have you not told me?

937
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:20,350
There is an issue
far more troublesome.

938
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:24,730
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

939
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:29,318
Not a person.

940
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:31,111
A heathen god.

941
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,031
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

942
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,534
and then revealing them
to be hollow and nought but ash.

943
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:39,119
The world is well rid of her.

944
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:41,705
Not quite so well, actually.

945
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:44,583
The Brethren Court intends to release her.

946
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,461
No. They cannot.

947
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:51,965
The first court promised to imprison her
forever. That was our agreement.

948
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,550
Your agreement?

949
01:31:55,969 --> 01:32:00,140
I showed them how to bind her.

950
01:32:00,349 --> 01:32:01,934
She could not be trusted.

951
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:03,727
I... She gave me no choice.

952
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:07,606
We must act before they release her.

953
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:09,107
You loved her.

954
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,611
She's the one.

955
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,738
And then you betrayed her.

956
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:18,242
She pretended to love me.

957
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:22,496
She betrayed me.

958
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:28,418
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder?

959
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,424
Do not test me.

960
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,218
I hadn't finished that.

961
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:41,014
You will free my father.

962
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:45,519
And you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety
along with my own.

963
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:48,146
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

964
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,649
We will expect fair value in return.

965
01:32:51,525 --> 01:32:55,529
There is only one price I will accept:

966
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:58,490
Calypso murdered.

967
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:02,411
<i>Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.</i>

968
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:07,833
Jack has sailed the <i>Black Pearl</i>
to Shipwreck Cove.

969
01:33:09,293 --> 01:33:14,756
And with you no longer aboard her
how do you propose to lead us there?

970
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,229
What is it you want most?

971
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:02,471
Look at them all.

972
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:06,850
There's not been a gathering like this
in our lifetime.

973
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:09,436
And I owe them all money.

974
01:34:15,067 --> 01:34:16,902
As he who issued summons,

975
01:34:17,611 --> 01:34:21,531
I convene this,
the fourth Brethren Court.

976
01:34:25,911 --> 01:34:29,122
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

977
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:33,877
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow captains.

978
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:45,389
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

979
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:49,059
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso,

980
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:53,980
but when the first court met,
the brethren were to a one skint broke.

981
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:55,232
So change the name.

982
01:34:56,066 --> 01:34:57,109
What?

983
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:00,737
To "nine pieces of whatever we happen
to have in our pockets at the time"?

984
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:03,031
Oh, yes, that sounds very pirate-y.

985
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:09,746
Master Ragetti, if you will.

986
01:35:09,955 --> 01:35:12,999
I kept it safe for you,
just like you said when you gave it to me.

987
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:16,294
Aye, you have. Now I need it back.

988
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:20,757
Sparrow?

989
01:35:26,847 --> 01:35:29,850
Might I point out
that we are still short one pirate lord

990
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:33,937
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

991
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:36,648
Sao Feng is dead.

992
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:41,153
<i>- He fell to the Flying Dutchman.
- The plagued ship.</i>

993
01:35:42,571 --> 01:35:45,824
He made you captain? They're just giving
the bloody title away now.

994
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:48,869
Listen. Listen to me.

995
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:51,163
Our location has been betrayed.

996
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,875
Jones is under the command
of Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

997
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,501
Who is this betrayer?

998
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:59,171
Not likely anyone among us.

999
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,423
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

1000
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,341
And it matters not how they found us.

1001
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:06,970
The question is,
"What will we do now that they have?"

1002
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:08,972
We fight.

1003
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:15,645
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

1004
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:18,940
A well-supplied fortress.

1005
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,778
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

1006
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,824
There be a third course.

1007
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:30,619
In another age, at this very spot,

1008
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,789
the first Brethren Court
captured the sea goddess

1009
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:37,167
and bound her in her bones.

1010
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,295
That was a mistake.

1011
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:45,133
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

1012
01:36:45,342 --> 01:36:49,513
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

1013
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:52,766
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

1014
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:56,686
came not from bargains struck
with eldritch creatures

1015
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,941
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

1016
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,818
You all know this to be true.

1017
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:05,654
Gentlemen,

1018
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,406
ladies,

1019
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,121
we must free Calypso.

1020
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,383
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue.

1021
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:30,387
Shoot him, and cut out his tongue,
and shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

1022
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,430
Sao Feng would have agreed
with Barbossa.

1023
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,391
- Aye.
- Calypso was our enemy then.

1024
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:35,934
She will be our enemy now.

1025
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:37,936
And it's unlikely her mood's improved.

1026
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:41,857
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1027
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:44,818
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

1028
01:37:57,247 --> 01:38:00,250
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

1029
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,627
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1030
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:05,505
If they not be here already.

1031
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:44,336
My sweet.

1032
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,880
You come for me.

1033
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:49,925
You were expecting me.

1034
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:52,469
It has been torture

1035
01:38:53,136 --> 01:38:56,765
trapped in this single form,

1036
01:38:57,599 --> 01:39:00,268
cut off from the sea,

1037
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:03,104
from all that I love,

1038
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,149
from you.

1039
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:11,571
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged me.

1040
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:17,452
Ten years I looked after those
who died at sea.

1041
01:39:18,495 --> 01:39:23,833
And finally,
when we could be together again,

1042
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:28,213
you weren't there.

1043
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:32,592
Why weren't you there?

1044
01:39:34,678 --> 01:39:36,262
Is my nature.

1045
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:42,102
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

1046
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:47,774
I do not love you.

1047
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:54,114
Many things you were, Davy Jones,

1048
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:56,491
but never cruel.

1049
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:00,620
You have corrupted your purpose,

1050
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,000
and so yourself.

1051
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:11,381
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1052
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:33,862
Calypso.

1053
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,159
I will be free.

1054
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:44,706
And when I am, I will give you my heart

1055
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:47,417
and we will be together always.

1056
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:52,547
If only you had a heart to give.

1057
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:58,261
Why did you come?

1058
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:20,742
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1059
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:24,245
The Brethren Court?

1060
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:30,251
All of them,
the last thing they will learn in this life

1061
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:33,797
is how cruel I can be.

1062
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:41,763
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1063
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:46,684
My heart will always belong to you.

1064
01:42:00,615 --> 01:42:03,910
It was the first court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1065
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:06,204
We should be the ones to set her free.

1066
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:11,209
And in her gratitude
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1067
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,211
Whose boons? Your boons?

1068
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:15,797
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1069
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:20,760
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1070
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,054
Cuttlefish.

1071
01:42:24,222 --> 01:42:25,932
Aye.

1072
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:33,481
Let us not, dear friends,
forget our dear friends the cuttlefish.

1073
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,733
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1074
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:40,029
Pen them up together and they will devour
each other without a second thought.

1075
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,199
Human nature, isn't it? Or fish nature.

1076
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:47,287
So yes, we could hole up here
well provisioned and well armed

1077
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:49,747
and half of us would be dead
within the month,

1078
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:54,085
which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1079
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:01,259
...as my learned colleague

1080
01:43:01,885 --> 01:43:05,972
so naively suggests,
we can release Calypso

1081
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:08,516
and we can pray
that she will be merciful.

1082
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:10,768
I rather doubt it.

1083
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:15,607
Can we, in fact, pretend that she is
anything other than a woman scorned

1084
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:19,652
like which fury hell hath no?
We cannot.

1085
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,825
We are left with but one option.

1086
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:30,246
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth,

1087
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:33,291
Captain Swann.

1088
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:35,251
We must fight.

1089
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,296
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1090
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:40,798
- You have so. You have so.
- Have not. Have not.

1091
01:43:41,007 --> 01:43:42,425
You have so, and you know it.

1092
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:45,887
Have not. Slander and calumny.
I have only ever embraced

1093
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:48,306
that oldest and noblest
of pirate traditions.

1094
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:52,602
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do.

1095
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:56,314
We must fight to run away.

1096
01:43:56,522 --> 01:43:57,982
- Aye!
- Aye!

1097
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,943
- Aye!
- Aye!

1098
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:05,073
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1099
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:07,909
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1100
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:10,620
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1101
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:15,416
I call on Captain Teague,
keeper of the code.

1102
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:21,130
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly.

1103
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:24,467
Hang the code. Who cares a...

1104
01:44:31,933 --> 01:44:33,685
Code is the law.

1105
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,157
You're in my way, boy.

1106
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,210
- The code.
- The code.

1107
01:44:59,419 --> 01:45:01,713
As set forth
by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1108
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:21,774
That can't... How did...?

1109
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:24,444
Sea turtles, mate.

1110
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:27,405
Sea turtles?

1111
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:45,590
Barbossa is right.

1112
01:45:46,174 --> 01:45:47,383
Hang on a minute.

1113
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,596
"It shall be the duties of the king
to declare war,

1114
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:55,183
parley with shared adversaries."
Fancy that.

1115
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,727
There has not been a king
since the first court

1116
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,479
and that's not likely to change.

1117
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,731
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1118
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:04,359
See, the pirate king is elected
by popular vote.

1119
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,904
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1120
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,238
I call for a vote.

1121
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:16,245
I vote for Ammand the Corsair.

1122
01:46:16,788 --> 01:46:18,873
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1123
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:22,168
Sri Sumbhajee votes
for Sri Sumbhajee.

1124
01:46:23,044 --> 01:46:24,754
Mistress Ching.

1125
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:26,547
Gentleman Jocard.

1126
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:28,216
Elizabeth Swann.

1127
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:31,552
- Barbossa.
- Vallenueva.

1128
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:33,638
Elizabeth Swann.

1129
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,474
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1130
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,313
You're going to vote for me.
You're going to vote for me, sir.

1131
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:45,858
No!

1132
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:49,404
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

1133
01:46:58,413 --> 01:47:00,248
Very well.

1134
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:07,839
What say you, Captain Swann,
King of the Brethren Court?

1135
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:12,885
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1136
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:15,012
At dawn,

1137
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:16,889
we're at war.

1138
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:24,313
And so we shall go to war.

1139
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:39,912
What?

1140
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:42,748
You've seen it all, done it all.
You survived.

1141
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:46,127
That's the trick, isn't it? To survive?

1142
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:50,882
It's not just about living forever, Jackie.

1143
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:58,389
The trick is living with yourself forever.

1144
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:03,644
How's Mum?

1145
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:12,487
She looks great.

1146
01:48:33,508 --> 01:48:37,094
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1147
01:49:00,535 --> 01:49:03,454
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1148
01:49:11,879 --> 01:49:13,589
Paﬂey?

1149
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:13,733
You be the cur
that led these wolves to our door.

1150
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:17,612
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1151
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:23,075
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1152
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:27,288
My hands are clean in this.

1153
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:29,707
Figuratively.

1154
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:33,127
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1155
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:36,422
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1156
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:38,966
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

1157
01:50:39,175 --> 01:50:42,595
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1158
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:47,683
No cause is lost
if there is but one fool left to fight for it.

1159
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:54,148
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1160
01:50:55,691 --> 01:51:01,030
You made a deal with me, Jack,
to deliver the pirates, and here they are.

1161
01:51:01,322 --> 01:51:04,492
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1162
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:08,454
Your debt to me is still to be satisfied.

1163
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:14,085
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman, as a start.

1164
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:17,380
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1165
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:19,048
You escaped.

1166
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,967
- Technically-
- I propose an exchange.

1167
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:26,597
Will leaves with us,

1168
01:51:26,806 --> 01:51:28,391
and you can take Jack.

1169
01:51:30,685 --> 01:51:32,144
Done.

1170
01:51:32,353 --> 01:51:33,896
- Undone.
- Done.

1171
01:51:34,105 --> 01:51:37,525
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1172
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:39,652
King.

1173
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,864
As you command, your nibs.

1174
01:51:44,073 --> 01:51:45,825
Blackguard!

1175
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:54,542
If you have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1176
01:51:57,336 --> 01:51:59,755
First to the finish, then?

1177
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:23,863
Do you fear death?

1178
01:52:24,947 --> 01:52:26,907
You've no idea.

1179
01:52:29,535 --> 01:52:34,623
Advise your brethren you can fight,
and all of you will die,

1180
01:52:34,832 --> 01:52:38,961
or you can not fight, in which case
only most of you will die.

1181
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:42,631
You murdered my father.

1182
01:52:43,174 --> 01:52:45,676
He chose his own fate.

1183
01:52:45,968 --> 01:52:48,387
And you have chosen yours.

1184
01:52:49,013 --> 01:52:51,015
We will fight,

1185
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:53,559
and you will die.

1186
01:52:57,855 --> 01:53:00,274
So be it.

1187
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:06,739
King?

1188
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:10,284
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1189
01:53:10,493 --> 01:53:13,120
Maybe he really does know
what he's doing.

1190
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:23,047
Bravo! You've successfully arrived
aboard the <i>Flying</i> Dutchman

1191
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:24,882
as per the overall scheme.

1192
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:27,051
- Look...
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1193
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:31,096
Except for this little sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1194
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:32,515
Go away.

1195
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:35,768
- What? Back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1196
01:53:36,811 --> 01:53:37,937
Stab the heart.

1197
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:48,697
<i>Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.</i>

1198
01:53:52,827 --> 01:53:54,870
Then again,

1199
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:57,456
if you're in the brig,

1200
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:01,252
who's to stab the heart?

1201
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:05,756
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1202
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:09,009
Peanut

1203
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:12,346
We'll use the <i>Black Pearl</i>
as a flagship to meet the attack.

1204
01:54:12,555 --> 01:54:15,641
- Will we, now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish.

1205
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:17,184
Come on.

1206
01:54:17,393 --> 01:54:20,312
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1207
01:54:21,272 --> 01:54:22,648
We need to give Jack a chance.

1208
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,900
Apologies, Your Majesty.

1209
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:27,945
Too long my fate
has not been in me own hands.

1210
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:32,491
No longer.

1211
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,787
The enemy

1212
01:54:37,496 --> 01:54:40,374
has opted for oblivion.

1213
01:54:42,918 --> 01:54:44,670
Ready the fleet.

1214
01:54:44,879 --> 01:54:47,256
- To your stations!
- To your stations!

1215
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:56,932
Be there some manner of rite
or incantation?

1216
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:58,767
Aye.

1217
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:01,979
The items brought together, done.

1218
01:55:02,521 --> 01:55:05,190
Items to be burned,

1219
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:07,276
and someone must speak the words,

1220
01:55:07,484 --> 01:55:10,946
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

1221
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:12,698
Is that it?

1222
01:55:12,907 --> 01:55:16,577
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1223
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:28,047
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds.

1224
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:39,141
Is that it?

1225
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:41,352
No, no. He didn't say it right.

1226
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:50,778
You have to say it right.

1227
01:55:58,661 --> 01:56:00,454
Calypso,

1228
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:07,044
I release you from your human bonds.

1229
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:27,356
Tia Dalma.

1230
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:31,110
Calypso.

1231
01:56:34,154 --> 01:56:37,783
When the Brethren Court first imprisoned
you, who was it that told them how'?

1232
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:42,579
Who was it that betrayed you?

1233
01:56:43,122 --> 01:56:44,373
Name him.

1234
01:56:45,833 --> 01:56:47,418
Davy Jones.

1235
01:57:01,724 --> 01:57:03,767
This is it.

1236
01:57:03,976 --> 01:57:05,519
This is it.

1237
01:57:48,145 --> 01:57:50,355
Calypso!

1238
01:57:51,732 --> 01:57:57,154
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1239
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:03,452
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favour.

1240
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:09,875
Spare meself, me ship, me crew,

1241
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:14,797
but unleash your fury upon those who dare
pretend themselves your masters,

1242
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,048
or mine.

1243
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:15,232
Is that it?

1244
01:59:18,318 --> 01:59:20,988
Why, she's no help at all.

1245
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:25,909
What now?

1246
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,911
Nothing.

1247
01:59:28,287 --> 01:59:31,206
Our final hope has failed us.

1248
01:59:58,734 --> 02:00:00,068
It's not over.

1249
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:03,280
- There's still a fight to be had.
- We've an armada against us.

1250
02:00:03,488 --> 02:00:05,699
And with the Dutchman,
there's no chance.

1251
02:00:05,908 --> 02:00:08,118
There's only a fool's chance.

1252
02:00:08,327 --> 02:00:10,871
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1253
02:00:11,079 --> 02:00:14,750
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1254
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:21,089
You're right.

1255
02:00:26,053 --> 02:00:28,513
Then what shall we die for?

1256
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,685
You will listen to me.

1257
02:00:33,894 --> 02:00:35,771
Listen!

1258
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:40,776
The Brethren will still
be looking here to us,

1259
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:43,487
<i>to the Black Pearl to</i> lead.

1260
02:00:43,695 --> 02:00:44,863
And what will they see?

1261
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:48,700
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1262
02:00:48,909 --> 02:00:51,453
No, they will see free men

1263
02:00:51,662 --> 02:00:52,996
and freedom!

1264
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:56,625
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1265
02:00:56,833 --> 02:01:02,965
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1266
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:07,427
By the sweat of our brows,

1267
02:01:07,636 --> 02:01:09,221
and the strength of our backs,

1268
02:01:10,681 --> 02:01:13,433
and the courage of our hearts.

1269
02:01:15,811 --> 02:01:17,396
Gentlemen,

1270
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:21,900
hoist the colours.

1271
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:24,903
Hoist the colours.

1272
02:01:25,112 --> 02:01:27,322
- Hoist the colours.
- Hoist the colours!

1273
02:01:27,531 --> 02:01:30,784
Aye. The wind's on our side, boys.

1274
02:01:30,993 --> 02:01:33,745
That's all we need!

1275
02:01:35,038 --> 02:01:36,790
Hoist the colours!

1276
02:02:28,467 --> 02:02:30,969
We have a favourable wind, sir.

1277
02:02:31,178 --> 02:02:32,888
Oh, so we do.

1278
02:02:33,096 --> 02:02:36,350
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1279
02:02:37,059 --> 02:02:39,019
That should brighten his day.

1280
02:02:43,065 --> 02:02:47,319
To arms! We give no quarter!

1281
02:02:56,244 --> 02:02:58,246
Calypso.

1282
02:03:24,356 --> 02:03:27,192
Have you noticed
on top of everything it's raining?

1283
02:03:27,401 --> 02:03:28,443
That's a bad sign.

1284
02:03:28,652 --> 02:03:31,780
Man the capstan.
Raise the main top yard.

1285
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:33,281
Keep that powder dry.

1286
02:03:47,963 --> 02:03:49,714
Maelstrom!

1287
02:03:53,093 --> 02:03:55,554
Captain Barbossa!

1288
02:03:56,054 --> 02:03:58,056
We need you at the helm.

1289
02:04:00,725 --> 02:04:03,270
Aye, that be true.

1290
02:04:05,355 --> 02:04:10,277
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes!

1291
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:14,322
Dying is the day worth living for!

1292
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:26,334
Veer off!

1293
02:04:26,543 --> 02:04:28,753
She'll not harm us.

1294
02:04:28,962 --> 02:04:31,465
Full bore and into the abyss.

1295
02:04:32,215 --> 02:04:33,383
Are you mad?

1296
02:04:34,718 --> 02:04:36,428
You afraid to get wet?

1297
02:04:46,146 --> 02:04:48,440
She's on our stern and gaining.

1298
02:04:48,648 --> 02:04:50,442
More speed!

1299
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:54,196
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1300
02:05:01,077 --> 02:05:03,538
Bow cannons!

1301
02:05:03,747 --> 02:05:06,458
Bow the cannons!

1302
02:05:17,469 --> 02:05:20,138
Take us out, or they'll overbear us.

1303
02:05:20,347 --> 02:05:22,641
Nay. Further in.

1304
02:05:22,849 --> 02:05:26,353
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1305
02:05:26,561 --> 02:05:28,355
Prepare to broadside.

1306
02:05:38,949 --> 02:05:45,455
- Captain the guns. Bear ahead.
- Muster your courage, men. At the ready.

1307
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:55,882
Think like the whelp. Think like the whelp.
Think like the whelp.

1308
02:05:56,091 --> 02:05:59,052
Hinges. Hinges. Hinges.

1309
02:05:59,594 --> 02:06:03,014
- Half-barrel hinges.
- Leverage.

1310
02:06:07,602 --> 02:06:10,272
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1311
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:14,109
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1312
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:16,152
Nobody move.

1313
02:06:16,903 --> 02:06:19,030
I dropped me brain.

1314
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:31,042
Batten down the hatches!

1315
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:34,504
Stand to your guns!

1316
02:06:35,046 --> 02:06:37,591
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts!

1317
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:44,180
Main battery at the ready!

1318
02:06:48,768 --> 02:06:50,312
Hold there.

1319
02:06:50,854 --> 02:06:52,814
Wait till we're board-and-board.

1320
02:06:57,861 --> 02:06:59,154
Fire!

1321
02:06:59,863 --> 02:07:00,905
Fire!

1322
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:03,867
Fire! Fire all!

1323
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:06,077
Fire!

1324
02:07:09,623 --> 02:07:11,541
Fire!

1325
02:07:21,926 --> 02:07:23,678
Come on, men!

1326
02:07:32,979 --> 02:07:37,734
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1327
02:07:41,988 --> 02:07:43,698
Halt there, or we'll shoot.

1328
02:07:45,617 --> 02:07:47,035
Good one.

1329
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:51,581
I just come to get me effects.

1330
02:07:52,582 --> 02:07:56,670
Admirable though it may be, why are you
here when you could be elsewhere?

1331
02:07:56,878 --> 02:07:59,005
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1332
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:01,716
There's no question.

1333
02:08:01,925 --> 02:08:05,095
There has been a breakdown
in military discipline aboard this vessel.

1334
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:08,932
- I blame the fish people.
- Oh, so fish people,

1335
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:10,934
by dint of being fish people,

1336
02:08:11,142 --> 02:08:14,521
automatically aren't as disciplined
as non-fish people?

1337
02:08:14,729 --> 02:08:16,856
Seems contributory
is all I'm suggesting.

1338
02:08:17,065 --> 02:08:21,444
It is true, if there were no fish people
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1339
02:08:21,653 --> 02:08:25,407
And if there were no chest,
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1340
02:08:28,535 --> 02:08:31,913
Come on, men. Come on!

1341
02:08:33,206 --> 02:08:36,543
Prepare to board!

1342
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:37,794
Cover!

1343
02:08:55,145 --> 02:08:56,563
No.

1344
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:24,966
Lookie here, boys.

1345
02:09:25,175 --> 02:09:27,135
A lost bird.

1346
02:09:27,343 --> 02:09:31,222
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1347
02:09:32,807 --> 02:09:35,059
To my great regret.

1348
02:09:35,894 --> 02:09:37,520
But...

1349
02:09:39,647 --> 02:09:41,524
...never too late to learn, eh?

1350
02:09:58,124 --> 02:10:00,960
The chest. Hand it over.

1351
02:10:01,169 --> 02:10:02,837
I can set you free, mate.

1352
02:10:03,046 --> 02:10:06,508
My freedom was forfeit long ago.

1353
02:10:53,137 --> 02:10:54,931
Elizabeth.

1354
02:10:58,184 --> 02:10:59,978
Elizabeth.

1355
02:11:00,728 --> 02:11:01,771
Will you marry me?

1356
02:11:03,690 --> 02:11:05,358
I don't think now is the best time.

1357
02:11:09,487 --> 02:11:11,489
Now may be the only time.

1358
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:17,620
I love you.

1359
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:26,087
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1360
02:11:27,171 --> 02:11:28,506
Barbossa!

1361
02:11:30,008 --> 02:11:31,384
Marry us!

1362
02:11:32,552 --> 02:11:34,929
I'm a little busy at the moment!

1363
02:11:41,311 --> 02:11:43,771
Barbossa, now!

1364
02:11:44,981 --> 02:11:46,357
Fine then.

1365
02:11:57,285 --> 02:12:00,163
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today,

1366
02:12:00,997 --> 02:12:04,834
to nail your gizzards to the mast,
you poxy cur.

1367
02:12:09,422 --> 02:12:12,175
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1368
02:12:12,383 --> 02:12:14,302
- I do.
- Great.

1369
02:12:21,184 --> 02:12:23,603
Will Turner, do you take me

1370
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,731
to be your wife,

1371
02:12:31,194 --> 02:12:32,445
in sickness and in health,

1372
02:12:33,613 --> 02:12:35,615
with health being the less likely?

1373
02:12:43,081 --> 02:12:44,374
I do.

1374
02:12:46,626 --> 02:12:49,212
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1375
02:12:52,632 --> 02:12:54,008
You may kiss...

1376
02:13:03,184 --> 02:13:04,894
You may kiss...

1377
02:13:09,649 --> 02:13:11,359
Just kiss.

1378
02:13:50,064 --> 02:13:52,150
Leave it.

1379
02:14:03,745 --> 02:14:06,247
You can do nothing without the key.

1380
02:14:06,456 --> 02:14:07,749
I already have the key.

1381
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:11,169
No, you don't.

1382
02:14:12,086 --> 02:14:13,379
Oh, that key.

1383
02:14:49,499 --> 02:14:51,167
No!

1384
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:19,904
My Pistol.

1385
02:15:48,141 --> 02:15:49,183
Turner.

1386
02:15:54,188 --> 02:15:55,773
Fire!

1387
02:16:01,654 --> 02:16:02,822
Thank you, Jack.

1388
02:16:33,477 --> 02:16:35,354
It's me.

1389
02:16:36,814 --> 02:16:39,317
It's Will. Your son.

1390
02:17:40,836 --> 02:17:41,879
Go!

1391
02:18:00,481 --> 02:18:04,402
Harridan!
You'll see no mercy from me!

1392
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:07,029
That's why I brought this.

1393
02:18:26,424 --> 02:18:30,469
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1394
02:18:38,811 --> 02:18:42,356
Mister, did you forget?

1395
02:18:43,149 --> 02:18:45,693
I'm a heartless wretch.

1396
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:06,005
Love.

1397
02:19:06,213 --> 02:19:09,592
A dreadful bond.

1398
02:19:10,092 --> 02:19:14,972
And yet, so easily severed.

1399
02:19:15,181 --> 02:19:17,391
Tell me, William Turner,

1400
02:19:18,059 --> 02:19:20,394
do you fear death?

1401
02:19:20,603 --> 02:19:22,396
Do you?

1402
02:19:32,948 --> 02:19:36,243
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1403
02:19:37,286 --> 02:19:41,415
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1404
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:44,502
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1405
02:19:45,461 --> 02:19:47,338
Is it?

1406
02:20:12,988 --> 02:20:14,615
Will.

1407
02:20:15,741 --> 02:20:17,701
Look at me. Stay with me.
You're all right.

1408
02:20:23,999 --> 02:20:25,584
William.

1409
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:27,920
My son.

1410
02:20:39,432 --> 02:20:42,768
Will. Will, look at me. Look at me!

1411
02:20:46,856 --> 02:20:51,318
You will not forestall my judgment

1412
02:21:06,417 --> 02:21:08,752
Calypso.

1413
02:21:14,216 --> 02:21:16,343
She's taking us down!

1414
02:21:16,552 --> 02:21:20,264
Make quick, or it's the Locker for us all!

1415
02:21:55,674 --> 02:21:59,261
No.No.No!

1416
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:04,350
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1417
02:22:04,725 --> 02:22:07,770
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1418
02:22:07,978 --> 02:22:11,065
- Part of the ship, part of the crew.
- Don't leave me.

1419
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:15,152
I won't leave you.

1420
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:27,206
The Dutchman must have a captain.

1421
02:22:30,167 --> 02:22:31,418
Hold on.

1422
02:23:26,473 --> 02:23:29,226
Thank goodness, Jack.
The armada is still out there.

1423
02:23:29,435 --> 02:23:31,687
The Endeavour is coming up
hard to starboard

1424
02:23:31,895 --> 02:23:36,317
and I think it's time we embrace
that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1425
02:23:36,525 --> 02:23:39,278
Never actually been one for tradition.

1426
02:23:44,158 --> 02:23:46,910
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in iron.

1427
02:23:47,119 --> 02:23:50,623
- Belay that! Or we'll be a sitting duck.
- Belay that "belay that."

1428
02:23:50,831 --> 02:23:52,374
- But, captain...
- Belay. Belay.

1429
02:23:52,583 --> 02:23:55,336
Stow. Stow. Shut it.

1430
02:24:08,098 --> 02:24:10,434
What are they waiting for?

1431
02:24:11,018 --> 02:24:14,355
He expects us to honour our agreement.

1432
02:24:16,106 --> 02:24:19,443
Ready guns and gun ports.

1433
02:24:23,113 --> 02:24:27,493
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1434
02:24:54,395 --> 02:24:56,897
She survived.

1435
02:25:22,089 --> 02:25:23,507
Ready on the guns.

1436
02:25:26,009 --> 02:25:28,053
- Full canvas.
- Full canvas!

1437
02:25:28,262 --> 02:25:30,514
Aye, full canvas!

1438
02:25:55,247 --> 02:25:56,498
Orders, sir.

1439
02:26:00,169 --> 02:26:01,712
Sir!

1440
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,213
Captain.

1441
02:26:03,422 --> 02:26:05,007
- Fire.
- Fire!

1442
02:26:05,215 --> 02:26:06,842
Fire!

1443
02:26:07,050 --> 02:26:09,803
- Fire!
- Fire!

1444
02:26:20,564 --> 02:26:23,942
Orders! Orders, sir!

1445
02:26:35,829 --> 02:26:37,122
Sir, what do you command?

1446
02:26:38,207 --> 02:26:39,875
It's just...

1447
02:26:41,543 --> 02:26:43,253
...good business.

1448
02:26:44,797 --> 02:26:45,923
Abandon ship!

1449
02:26:46,131 --> 02:26:50,511
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1450
02:28:16,138 --> 02:28:17,764
They're turning away!

1451
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:32,070
Wind in your sails.

1452
02:28:37,492 --> 02:28:39,369
Shiver me timbers!

1453
02:29:17,199 --> 02:29:19,493
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain?

1454
02:29:20,118 --> 02:29:23,580
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, captain.

1455
02:29:23,789 --> 02:29:25,165
Hooray!

1456
02:29:27,542 --> 02:29:29,628
Now go and get it.

1457
02:29:47,729 --> 02:29:49,606
Orders, sir?

1458
02:29:53,610 --> 02:29:56,113
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman.

1459
02:29:56,321 --> 02:29:59,408
- You're free.
- Aye.

1460
02:30:00,033 --> 02:30:02,244
That's a fine thing,

1461
02:30:03,912 --> 02:30:08,000
but by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1462
02:30:08,542 --> 02:30:10,502
If you'll have me.

1463
02:30:14,047 --> 02:30:15,841
On the wheel then, Mr. Turner.

1464
02:30:17,384 --> 02:30:19,678
Aye, Captain Turner.

1465
02:30:34,276 --> 02:30:36,903
This ship has a purpose again.

1466
02:30:37,112 --> 02:30:41,867
And where we are bound,
she cannot come.

1467
02:30:42,534 --> 02:30:44,161
One day ashore.

1468
02:30:44,369 --> 02:30:46,747
Ten years at sea.

1469
02:30:47,664 --> 02:30:50,125
It's a steep price for what's been done.

1470
02:30:52,377 --> 02:30:54,296
Depends on the one day.

1471
02:30:57,174 --> 02:30:59,760
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1472
02:31:03,722 --> 02:31:05,849
The oars are inside.

1473
02:31:17,194 --> 02:31:19,404
Mrs. Turner.

1474
02:31:24,117 --> 02:31:26,244
Goodbye, poppet.

1475
02:31:31,708 --> 02:31:33,418
Jack.

1476
02:31:34,336 --> 02:31:37,047
It would never have worked out
between us.

1477
02:31:39,549 --> 02:31:41,968
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1478
02:31:45,931 --> 02:31:47,891
Once was quite enough.

1479
02:31:49,643 --> 02:31:51,353
Thank you.

1480
02:32:10,872 --> 02:32:13,083
I'm gonna need the other one.

1481
02:32:45,448 --> 02:32:47,492
It's nearly sunset.

1482
02:33:06,386 --> 02:33:07,721
It's always belonged to you.

1483
02:33:13,602 --> 02:33:15,187
Will you keep it safe?

1484
02:33:16,938 --> 02:33:18,773
Yes.

1485
02:33:22,194 --> 02:33:23,862
Yes.

1486
02:33:43,048 --> 02:33:44,966
Will!

1487
02:33:59,814 --> 02:34:02,442
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1488
02:34:30,929 --> 02:34:32,472
Granted it tends to list to port

1489
02:34:32,681 --> 02:34:36,142
and has been, on occasion,
known to frighten young women.

1490
02:34:36,351 --> 02:34:41,273
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1491
02:34:41,481 --> 02:34:43,149
Is that it?

1492
02:34:43,358 --> 02:34:45,527
<i>The Black Pearl?</i>

1493
02:34:45,902 --> 02:34:47,529
It's not very big.

1494
02:34:47,737 --> 02:34:49,990
Love, that is a dinghy.

1495
02:34:50,198 --> 02:34:54,661
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish

1496
02:34:54,869 --> 02:34:57,664
and gone.

1497
02:34:58,290 --> 02:34:59,833
Why is it gone?

1498
02:35:00,041 --> 02:35:01,751
Is that it there?

1499
02:35:03,044 --> 02:35:04,838
Yes, there it is.

1500
02:35:05,046 --> 02:35:06,172
Why is it there?

1501
02:35:08,091 --> 02:35:11,594
- It's much larger up close.
- Jack, you promised to take us for a ride.

1502
02:35:11,803 --> 02:35:13,805
I was to be given the first ride.

1503
02:35:14,014 --> 02:35:15,432
What? You?

1504
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:18,310
- That's what he said.
- I never!

1505
02:35:20,103 --> 02:35:24,024
Mr. Gibbs, any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1506
02:35:24,232 --> 02:35:27,193
The ship? We're on the ship.

1507
02:35:29,738 --> 02:35:32,532
Jack! The ship's gone!

1508
02:35:32,741 --> 02:35:34,576
Really?

1509
02:35:35,785 --> 02:35:39,247
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1510
02:35:39,456 --> 02:35:43,877
Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you.
No, I don't love you.

1511
02:35:44,085 --> 02:35:47,172
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1512
02:35:47,380 --> 02:35:50,342
It is pronounced "egregious."

1513
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:53,970
By the way, no, I've never
actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1514
02:35:54,179 --> 02:35:57,015
All of this pales to utter insignificance
in light of the fact

1515
02:35:57,223 --> 02:36:00,518
that my ship is once again gone.
Savvy?

1516
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:16,326
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1517
02:36:20,205 --> 02:36:22,082
Tell me, ladies,

1518
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:25,418
- what do you know of sea turtles?
- Sea turtles?

1519
02:36:39,307 --> 02:36:41,851
You want a taste of this?

1520
02:36:43,395 --> 02:36:48,149
That's a good boy. You're daddy's boy.
Yes, you are.

1521
02:36:48,817 --> 02:36:50,443
Sir?

1522
02:36:51,277 --> 02:36:55,365
Some of the men don't feel entirely settled
about leaving Captain Jack behind.

1523
02:36:55,573 --> 02:36:57,200
- Again.
- Again.

1524
02:36:57,409 --> 02:36:59,244
Is that so?

1525
02:36:59,786 --> 02:37:02,956
It would make us feel a whole lot better
regarding our fortunes

1526
02:37:03,164 --> 02:37:05,708
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1527
02:37:06,251 --> 02:37:07,669
On the charts.

1528
02:37:07,877 --> 02:37:09,421
- Aye.
- With our own eyes.

1529
02:37:09,629 --> 02:37:13,425
To help put an ease to our burden of guilt,
so to speak.

1530
02:37:15,385 --> 02:37:17,887
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1531
02:37:18,513 --> 02:37:20,765
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1532
02:37:20,974 --> 02:37:24,561
Gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth.

1533
02:37:35,488 --> 02:37:37,365
Sparrow.

1534
02:37:37,574 --> 02:37:42,537
<i>Yo-ho, yo-ho
A pirate's life for me</i>

1535
02:38:08,062 --> 02:38:09,647
<i>We're devils and black sheep</i>

1536
02:38:10,356 --> 02:38:12,609
<i>Really bad eggs</i>

1537
02:38:32,337 --> 02:38:35,089
<i>Drink up me hearties, yo-ho</i>

1538
02:47:06,684 --> 02:47:10,396
<i>Yo-ho, yo-ho
A pirate's life for me</i>

1539
02:47:11,981 --> 02:47:16,610
<i>We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot
Drink up me hearties, yo-ho</i>

1540
02:47:16,819 --> 02:47:19,071
<i>We kidnap and ravage
And don't give a hoot</i>

1541
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,240
<i>Drink up me hearties, yo-ho</i>

1542
02:47:21,523 --> 02:47:27,538
<i>Yo-ho, yo-ho
A pirate's life for me</i>
