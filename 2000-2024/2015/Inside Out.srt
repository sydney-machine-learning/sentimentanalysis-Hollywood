1
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,675
Do you ever look atsomeone and wonder.

2
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,468
What is going on inside their head?

3
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,136
Well, I know.

4
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,706
Well, I know Riley's head.

5
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:44,343
And there she was.

6
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:47,504
Hello.

7
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:51,923
- Riley.Whoa. Look at you.

8
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:54,876
Aren't you a little bundle of joy.

9
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,190
Whoa.

10
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:30,948
It was amazing.Just Riley and me

11
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,379
forever.

12
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,779
Or for

13
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:42,059
33 seconds.

14
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:44,728
I'm Sadness.

15
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:48,519
Oh, hello.I'm Joy. So.

16
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,271
Can I just, if you could...

17
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,591
I don't know, let me fix that.
Thanks.

18
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:54,467
And that was just the beginning.

19
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:57,554
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

20
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,704
Very nice. Okay.
Looks like you got this.

21
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,019
Very good.
Oh. Sharp! Sharp!

22
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,050
No,Look Out!

23
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:07,836
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

24
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,113
Easy.
Easy.

25
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,585
Fall back!
Oh, we're good.

26
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,155
We're good.

27
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,702
- Woo. Good job. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

28
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,280
And.
We're back.

29
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,857
Whoa.

30
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,435
Here we go, alright.
Open.

31
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,133
- Hm. This looks new.
- Think it's safe?

32
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,468
- What is it?
- Ah...

33
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:27,157
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell people.

34
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:28,255
Hold on.
What is that?

35
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,488
This is Disgust.

36
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:33,230
She basically keeps Riley from being
poison, physically and socially.

37
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,763
That is not brightly colored.

38
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,587
Or shaped like a dinosaur.
Hold on guys.

39
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,102
It's broccoli!
Blah!

40
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,571
Yuck!

41
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,737
Well. I just saved our lives.

42
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:43,815
Yeah.
You're welcome.

43
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,656
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not going to get any dessert.

44
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,006
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

45
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,562
That's Anger.
He...

46
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:53,459
cares very deeply about
things being fair.

47
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,358
So, that's how you
want to play it, old man.

48
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:58,440
No dessert? Oh, sure.
We'll eat our dinner.

49
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,678
Right after you
eat this!

50
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,570
Arh!

51
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,300
Riley, Riley.
Here comes an airplane.

52
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,228
Oh, airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

53
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:12,083
- Oh.
- Oh.

54
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:22,071
And.you met Sadness.

55
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,258
She.Well, she.

56
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,049
I'm not actually sure what she does.

57
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:32,713
And I've checked, There's
no place for her to go. So.

58
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,854
She's good. We're good.
It's all great.

59
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,843
Anyway.
These are Riley's memories.

60
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,920
And they are mostly happy if you notice,
not to brag.

61
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:48,163
But the really important
ones are over here.

62
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,332
I don't want to get too technical
but these are called

63
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,011
core memories.

64
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:55,587
Each one came from a super
important time in Riley's life.

65
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,846
Like when she first scored a goal.
It was so amazing.

66
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,566
Hey-hey! Would you look at that.

67
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,188
Very nice.

68
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:05,102
- Woo-hoo!
- Yeah!

69
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,869
And each core memory powers
a different aspect of Riley's personality.

70
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:22,244
Like.
Hockey Island.

71
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,022
Goofball Island
is my personal favorite.

72
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,889
Come back here,
you little monkey!

73
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,424
Yup.
Goofball is the best.

74
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,223
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

75
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:41,484
Oh.
I love Honesty Island.

76
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,945
And that's the truth.

77
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,801
And of course,
Family Island is amazing.

78
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:52,094
The point is. The islands are personality
are what make Riley, Riley.

79
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,551
Look out,
Blue face.

80
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,656
Lava!
Hoo!

81
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:07,694
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

82
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,226
Hey, very nice.

83
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,787
- Agh.
- Brain freeze!

84
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,378
- Agh!
- Awh!

85
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:18,879
Aw.

86
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:25,954
- Yeah!
- Yeh!

87
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:30,182
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, Dad.

88
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,320
And...

89
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,258
We're out.

90
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:41,145
That's what I'm talking about.
Woo! Another perfect day.

91
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,403
Nice job everybody.

92
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:45,070
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

93
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,098
Alright.
We did not die today.

94
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,009
I call that an
unqualified success.

95
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:11,203
And, that's it.
We love our girl.

96
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:13,775
She's got great friends
and a great house.

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,748
Things couldn't be better.

98
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,523
After all.
Riley is 11 now.

99
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,164
What could happen?

100
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,224
Sold

101
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:22,644
- What?
- Aw!

102
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,996
- Hnh!
- Aw!

103
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:29,216
Okay.
Not what I had in mind.

104
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,655
Aw!

105
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,818
Hey, look. The Golden Gate Bridge,
isn't that great?

106
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:01,391
It's not made up of solid gold like we thought,
which is kind of disappointed.
 But still...

107
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,796
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

108
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:08,134
- Otherwise I be terrified right now.
- ... Yeah.

109
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,609
These are my kind of people.

110
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,030
Alright, just a few more blocks.

111
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:16,330
- We're almost to our new house.
- Step on it, Daddy.

112
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:19,525
Why can't we just live in the smelly car.
We're already been in it forever.

113
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,425
Which...
actually was really lucky.

114
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,270
Because that gave us plenty of time to think
about what our new house is going to look like.

115
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:28,162
What? Let's review
the top 5 daydreams.

116
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:30,002
- Woo, that looks safe.
- That looks nice.

117
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:32,637
Oh. This will be great for Riley.
Oh! No, no, no... this one.

118
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,937
Joy for the last time.
She cannot live in a cookie.

119
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,894
That's the one.
It comes with a dragon.

120
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,002
Are we getting close?
I can feel it.

121
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,854
Here it is.
Here's our new house.

122
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,781
And...

123
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:54,168
Maybe, it's nice on the inside.

124
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,643
- We're suppose to live here?
- Do we have to?

125
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:02,785
I'm telling you, it smells
that something died in here.

126
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,544
- Can you die from moving?
- Guys, you are overreacting.

127
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,092
- Nobody is dieing.
- A dead mouse!

128
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:09,336
- Great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

129
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,272
It's a house of the dead.
What're we gonna do?

130
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,825
- We're gonna get rabies.
- Get off from me!

131
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,371
Hey, hey, hey.
All through the drive,

132
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:16,681
Dad talked about how cool
our new room is.

133
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:18,648
- Let's go check it out.
- It's gonna be great.

134
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:19,911
Yes, yes, yes...

135
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,241
- No, no, no...
- I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

136
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,679
Get out the rubber ball.
We're in solitary confinement.

137
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,628
- Riley can't live here.
- She's right.

138
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,200
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

139
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,419
- This house stinks.
- It's the worst place

140
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,029
- ... I've been in my entire life.
- Oh, yeah.

141
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:33,565
Hey, it's nothing our
butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

142
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,972
I read somewhere that an
empty room is an opportunity.

143
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,488
- Where did you read that? - It doesn't
matter. I read it and it's great.

144
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,832
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

145
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:42,174
The hock lamp goes there.

146
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,459
- Put the chair there.
- Oh, the trophy collections.

147
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,864
- There...
- Stars!

148
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,619
- I like that.
- Now, we're talking.

149
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:49,855
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van.

150
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,292
Alright. Goodbye.
Well, guess what?

151
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:54,248
The moving van won't
be here till next Thursday.

152
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:55,751
Your kidding.

153
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:59,071
Our van is lost?
It's the worst day ever.

154
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:02,139
- You said it would be here yesterday.
- And I know that's what I said.

155
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,800
- That's what they told me.
- Mom and Dad are stress out.

156
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:05,908
- They are stress out. - Arguing.
- What're we going to do.

157
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:09,260
I've got a great idea.

158
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,132
Did you even read the contract?

159
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,537
Anderson makes her move.
She's closing in.

160
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:15,889
Hey.
Oh no, you're not.

161
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,437
- She's running for the shot.
- Coming behind you, watch out.

162
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:20,643
And she scores!
Yeah!

163
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:22,578
- Woo-hoo.
- Yo-ho.

164
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,206
Come on.
Grandma.

165
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,747
Ha.
Grandma?

166
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:28,589
Oh-oh, she put her hair up.
We're in for it.

167
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,399
Heyyy.
Put me down.

168
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,052
- Eh-heh-heh.
- Ha-ha.

169
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:37,574
Sorry, hold on.

170
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,523
- Hello.
- Wait. What.

171
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,133
You're kidding.

172
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,433
Alright. Stall for me,
I'll be right there.

173
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,441
The investors are suppose to
show up on Thursday, not today.

174
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,311
- I got to go.
- It's okay, we get it.

175
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:55,003
You're the best. Thanks hon.
See you, sweetie.

176
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:56,911
Dad just left us.

177
00:10:56,936 --> 00:11:00,087
Oh, he doesn't love us anymore.
That's sad.

178
00:11:00,112 --> 00:11:01,984
I should drive, right?

179
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,446
Joy.
What are you doing?

180
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,810
Just you.
give me 1 second.

181
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:12,192
You know what I've realised.
Riley hasn't had lunch. Remember?

182
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:17,549
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.
Maybe we can try that.

183
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,543
- Pizza sounds delicious.
- Pizza.

184
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:21,762
- Yeah, pizza.
- Pizza. Great idea. Let's get it.

185
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,567
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza.

186
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:26,698
That's it. I'm done.

187
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:30,014
Congratulation San Francisco.
You ruined pizza.

188
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:33,727
First the Hawaiians.
And now you.

189
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:36,672
What kind of a pizza place
only serves 1 kind of pizza.

190
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,251
Must be a San Francisco thing.

191
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,099
Still, it's not as bad as the soup
at that diner in Nebraska.

192
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,519
Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself.

193
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:49,560
We're good.
Family's running.

194
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,983
The drive out was pretty fun.
What was your favorite part?

195
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:54,470
Spitting out of the car window.

196
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,170
- Definitely not when Dad was singing.
- Wearing the sit belt.

197
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,428
Oh. What about the time
with the dinosaur.

198
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,134
- Oh, that's the one.
- That was great.

199
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,393
Say cheese.

200
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,126
- Dad. Dad. Dad
- Honey.

201
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,944
 Dad, look at the car.
Just look behind you.

202
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,991
No-no-no...

203
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,815
No!
Aw.

204
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,826
Nice one, Joy.

205
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:14,262
I like that time with the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

206
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,523
Wait, what.
What happened?

207
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,782
She did something to the memory.

208
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:29,474
- What did you do?
- I- I just touched it.

209
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,356
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Oh. Change it back, Joy.

210
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:32,641
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

211
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,668
- No. I guess I can't.
- Good going, Sadness.

212
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:38,308
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

213
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:44,023
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know.
I thought maybe if you, if you, I mean...

214
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:47,000
Joy.
We got a stairway coming up.

215
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:51,163
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figured out what's going on.

216
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,450
- Okay.
- Alright.

217
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:57,918
Get ready. This is the monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down.

218
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,250
Wait, what.
What happened?

219
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,472
- A core memory!
- Oh no.

220
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,481
- Sadness, what're you doing?
- It looked like one was crooked

221
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:17,881
So I opened it and it fell out.
I.

222
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,511
Woo-hoo!

223
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:26,656
It's just that. I want to,
maybe. hold one.

224
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,839
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

225
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:32,133
Sadness. You nearly
touch a core memory.

226
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,370
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

227
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:37,457
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

228
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,853
I... It's like
I'm having a break down.

229
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:41,770
You're not having a break down.
It's stress.

230
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,733
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

231
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,784
- Oh, you're not.
- And annoying.

232
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:48,882
They, well...
You know what.

233
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,850
You can't focus on
what's going wrong.

234
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,608
There's always a way
to turn things around

235
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,341
To find the fun.

236
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,770
Yeah, find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

237
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,739
Okay, well.
Try to think of something funny.

238
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,227
Oh. Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

239
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,279
Oh, yeah.
That's not...

240
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,834
What about that time, with Mag.

241
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:13,979
When Riley laughed so hard,
milk came out of her nose.

242
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:15,098
Come on.

243
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:18,206
Yeah, that hurts.
It felt like fire.

244
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,703
- It was awf...
- Okay, okay.

245
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,670
Don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

246
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,129
- What're your favorite things to do.
- My favorite?

247
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:26,910
Well, I like it
when we're outside.

248
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:30,126
That's good! Like, there's
the beach and sunshine.

249
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:33,128
Oh. Like the time we buried
Dad in the sand up to his neck.

250
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:36,267
I was thinking more like rain.

251
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:40,024
Rain
Rain is my favorite too!

252
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,723
We can stomp around the puddles

253
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:45,232
You know.
There's cool umbrellas, lightning storms.

254
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:49,340
More like when the rain went south and bad,
that makes our shoe soggy.

255
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:55,089
And we get all cold, shivery and
everything starts feeling droopy.

256
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:57,425
Oh. Hey, hey, hey.
Easy.

257
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,654
Why are you crying?

258
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,145
It's... It's really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

259
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,640
Crying helps me slow down and not
obsessive worried of life's problems.

260
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:11,591
You know what?
Let's think about something else.

261
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:15,141
How about we read some mind manuals.
Sounds fun.

262
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,489
I've read most of them.

263
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,467
Well. Have you read this one.
This seem interesting.

264
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:21,730
Long term memory retrieval.
Volume 47.

265
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,228
- No.
- Woo. A real page turner.

266
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:28,247
Long term memory data selection
via channel sober be.

267
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:30,550
See. Fun already.
Oh, you lucky dog.

268
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:35,495
You're reading these cool things,
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

269
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:43,031
Ugh.

270
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:47,288
What can we do. We only got
capital that'll last a month maybe two.

271
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,750
If we can't find investors by then,
we're gonna have to lay people off.

272
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:54,000
Mom. Dad.
Come kiss me good night.

273
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:58,072
- I know. I know. We got to land
this, okay. - Be right there.

274
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:03,259
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

275
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,405
What was that? Was it a bear?
It's a bear!

276
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,065
There are no bears
in San Francisco.

277
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,189
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

278
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,393
Oh. I'm so jumpy, my
nerves are shocked.

279
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,070
Ew. I don't wanna
hear about your nerves.

280
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:17,767
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

281
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,389
That's what I've been
telling you guys.

282
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,768
There're at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

283
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,435
This smell alone is enough
to make her gag.

284
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,413
I can't believe Mom and
Dad moved us here.

285
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:27,866
Look. I get it.
You guys have concerns.

286
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,326
But we've been through worst.

287
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:33,345
Tell you what. Let's make a list of all
the things Riley should be happy about.

288
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,956
Fine. Let's see.
This house stinks. Our room stinks.

289
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,966
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

290
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:40,206
And all our stuff
is in the missing van.

291
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,687
Oh, come on.
It could be worse.

292
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:45,256
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on a dirty floor. In a bag.

293
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:47,375
Okay, I admit it.
We had a rough start.

294
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,415
- But think of all the good things that...
- No, Joy.

295
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,681
There is absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

296
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:53,698
Let us handle this.

297
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,329
I say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom.

298
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,034
We have no clean clothes

299
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,841
And we could cry until we can't breathe.

300
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:02,620
We should lock the door and
scream the curse word we know.

301
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,555
- It's a good one.
- Now, hold on.

302
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,533
Look. We all have our off days.
You know...

303
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:08,594
Hi honey.

304
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,641
The Mom bad news Train is pulling in.
Toot-toot.

305
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,695
Still no moving van.
Uh-huh.

306
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,389
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday. Can you believe it.

307
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:18,656
Toot-toot-toot.

308
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,741
- Where's Dad?
- On the phone.

309
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:22,709
This new adventure is
keeping him pretty busy.

310
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:25,482
I
rest my case.

311
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:31,886
Now, for a few well place
withering scowls.

312
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,906
I guess all I really
want to say is

313
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,284
thank you.

314
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,735
You know.
Through all these confusion you stayed...

315
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,627
Well,
you stayed our happy girl.

316
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,811
Your Dad is under
a lot of pressure.

317
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:50,137
But, if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

318
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:53,439
We can do that for him.
Right?

319
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:55,120
Whoa.

320
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:56,976
Well.

321
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:00,159
Yeah.
Sure.

322
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:02,892
What did we do
to deserve you.

323
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:08,383
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

324
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,669
Well.
You can't argue with Mom.

325
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:11,853
- Happy it is.
- Can't argue with Mom, that's true.

326
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:14,537
- Team Happy. Sounds great.
- Totally behind you, Joy.

327
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,057
Looks like we're
going into R E M.

328
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:20,093
I've got dream duty so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

329
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:24,608
Great day today, guys.
All is well, team Happy.

330
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,712
Alright.
What's on tonight, dream production?

331
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,345
Now. This is it.
The new place.

332
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:41,613
Come live with me, Riley.

333
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:46,440
- Somebody ordered a broccoli pizza.
- Eat me, I'm organic.

334
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,261
Now. Who is in charge of
programming down there?

335
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:53,384
I know I'm not suppose to do this.
But.

336
00:18:57,462 --> 00:19:00,527
We are not going to
end the day like this.

337
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,165
Don't you worry.

338
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,249
I'm going to make sure that
tomorrow is another great day.

339
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:51,431
I promise.

340
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,719
Carame- Corn-Curls

341
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:06,142
- Hello. Did I wake you?
- Do you have to play that?

342
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,441
Well, I have to practice.

343
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:10,889
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging

344
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,776
Okay. First day of school.
Very, very exciting.

345
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,801
I was up late last night figuring out
a new plan. Here it is.

346
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,053
- Fear. I need a list
- What?

347
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:21,171
of all the possible negative outcomes
on the first day at a new school.

348
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,424
Way ahead of you there.
They won't notice no meteor.

349
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:25,460
Disgust.
Make sure Riley stands out today.

350
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:26,819
But, also blends in.

351
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,786
When I'm through, Riley will
look so good,

352
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,019
the other kids will look at
their own outfits and fart.

353
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,646
Joy! Yes, Joy.
You'll be in charge of the console.

354
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,093
Keeping Riley happy
all day long.

355
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,823
And may I add, I love your dress,
it's adorable.

356
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:40,242
Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls.

357
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:43,140
Train of Thought,
right on schedule.

358
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,573
Anger.
Unload the daydreams.

359
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:48,847
I ordered extra,
in case things get slow in class.

360
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,163
Might come in handy. If this new school
is full of boring, useless classes.

361
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:53,849
Which it probably will be.

362
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,629
Oh, Sadness. I've a super
important job just for you.

363
00:20:57,654 --> 00:21:00,312
- Really.
- Uh-heh. Follow me.

364
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:04,352
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect.

365
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:06,472
This is the circle of sadness.

366
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:11,064
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

367
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,727
So, you want me
just to stand here?

368
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:16,721
Hey, it's not my place to
tell you how to do your job.

369
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,085
Just make sure that

370
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:21,603
all... the sadness
stays in the circle.

371
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,789
See. You're a pro at this.
Isn't this fun?

372
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:25,991
- No.
- Atta girl.

373
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,389
Alright everyone, fresh start.

374
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:29,454
We're going to have a good day
which will turn into a good week,

375
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:32,149
which will turn into a good year,
which will turn into a good life!

376
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,246
So, big day.
New school. New friends.

377
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:37,652
I know. I'm kind of nervous
but I'm mostly excited.

378
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:40,736
- How do I look? Do you like my quote?
- Very cute.

379
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:42,694
You gonna be okay.
You want us to walk with you?

380
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:45,297
Mom and Dad, with us in public.
No, thank you.

381
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,370
Yup, I'm on it.

382
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:48,788
Nope, I'm fine.
Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

383
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:50,294
Have a good day in school, monkey.

384
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,199
- Woo-woo... - Woo-woot...
- Woo... Woo...

385
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,877
Have a great day, sweetheart.

386
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,889
- Are you sure we want to do this?
- In we go.

387
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:09,066
Okay, going in.
Yes.

388
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:15,640
Okay. We've got a group of
cool girls at 2 o'clock.

389
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:18,317
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierce. Infinity scarf.

390
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:21,030
- Whoa. Is she wearing eye shadow?
- Yeah. We want to be friends with them.

391
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:22,487
- Let's go talk to them.
- Are you kidding.

392
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:25,227
We're not talking to them.
We want them to like us.

393
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,520
Oh... yeah.
Wait.  What?

394
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,627
Almost finished with
the potential disasters.

395
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:32,173
Worst scenario is either quicksands,
spontaneous combustion

396
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:35,147
or getting called on by the teacher.
As long as none of those happens...

397
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,942
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

398
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:41,383
Are you kidding me! Out of the days!
This is not happening!

399
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,016
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

400
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,396
No!
Pretend we can't speak English.

401
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,453
Don't worry.
I got this.

402
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:50,758
Okay.

403
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,521
My name is Riley Anderson.

404
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:56,547
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

405
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,219
And how about Minnesota?

406
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,663
Can you tell us something about it?

407
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:04,659
Well you certainly get
a lot more snow than we do.

408
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:08,972
Ha-ha-ha.
She's hilarious.

409
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,124
Yeah, it get's pretty cold.

410
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:13,635
The lake freezes over.
And that’s when we play hockey.

411
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,068
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie dogs.

412
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:19,403
My friend, Mag, plays forward
and my dad's the coach.

413
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:21,919
Pretty much everyone in my family skates.

414
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,414
It's kind of a family tradition.

415
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:26,353
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

416
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,825
Or, we did.
Till...

417
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,114
I moved away.

418
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:32,409
- Hey. What gives?
- What?

419
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,874
Hey, Sadness.
You touched a memory.

420
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:37,976
- We talked about this.
- Oh yeah, I know. But I...

421
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,589
Get back in your circle.

422
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:41,076
Ah.
What's going on?

423
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:43,053
- Get it out of there, Joy.
- Eject.

424
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:45,529
We used to play tag and stuff.

425
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,457
Cool kids whispering at 3 o'clock.

426
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:50,340
Did you see that look?
They're judging us.

427
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:53,718
Somebody help grab that thing.
Everybody put in...

428
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:56,521
But, everything is different now.

429
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,649
Since we moved.

430
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,696
Oh no.
We're crying and sloth.

431
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,791
What?
Sadness, what are you doing!

432
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,990
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm, oh.

433
00:24:11,397 --> 00:24:14,921
- It's a core memory.
- But, it's blue.

434
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:17,259
No!
Wait!

435
00:24:17,284 --> 00:24:18,915
Stop it.
No.

436
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,433
No.

437
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:28,003
Joy.
No.

438
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:29,384
- That's a core memory.
- Hey!

439
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,379
- Stop it.  Let go.
- Don't.  Wait.

440
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,713
The core memories!

441
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,900
Aw!

442
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:49,513
No-no-no...

443
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,189
- Aw!
- Aw!

444
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:03,672
Thank you, Riley.

445
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:06,103
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place.

446
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,781
But we are happy
to have you here.

447
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,068
Alright everyone.
Get out you history books.

448
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,514
And turn to chapter 7.

449
00:25:15,158 --> 00:25:17,759
Can I say that curse word now?

450
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,821
- Eh.
- Aw!

451
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:23,755
Awww!

452
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:32,081
Awwwww...!

453
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,998
Awwwwww...

454
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:41,723
Oh no.
1, 2, 3, okay.

455
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,968
Not enough.
What?

456
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:48,787
What a nice pass, over to Reed.
Constance cross the line.

457
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,034
Uh-oh.
She's looking at us.

458
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,979
- What did she say?
- What?

459
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:57,863
Oh, sorry sir.
No one was listening.

460
00:25:57,888 --> 00:26:00,229
Isn't it garbage night?
We let the toilet seat up.

461
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:02,385
What? What is it, woman?
What?

462
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,450
- He's making that stupid face again.
- I could strangle him right now.

463
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,674
Signal him again.

464
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,651
Ah.
So.

465
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:13,014
Riley, how was school?

466
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,904
- Aw. Waste of time.
- You got to be kidding me. - Seriously?

467
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,292
For this, we gave up that
Brazilian helicopter pilot?

468
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:20,175
Move!
I'll be joy.

469
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,261
School was great.
Alright.

470
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:24,826
Riley.
Is everything okay?

471
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:27,540
Sir,
she just rolled her eyes at us.

472
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:28,897
What is her deal?

473
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:32,267
Alright, make a show of force.
I don't want to have to put the foot down.

474
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,214
No.
Not the foot.

475
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,628
Riley,
I do not like this new attitude.

476
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,382
Oh.
I'll show you attitude, old man.

477
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,860
No-no-no-no.
Stay happy.

478
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,695
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone.

479
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,900
Sir.
Reporting high level of sass.

480
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,510
Take it to DEFCON 2.

481
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:49,233
Your heard that gentlemen.
DEFCON 2.

482
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:53,365
Listen, young lady. I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from.

483
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,252
You want a piece of this, pops.
Come and get it!

484
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:58,024
Yeah.  Well.
Well.

485
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,057
Here it comes.
Prepare the foot.

486
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,894
Keys, to exec position.

487
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:07,621
Ready to launch
on your command, sir.

488
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:09,570
Awwww!

489
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,474
Just, shut up!

490
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:13,659
Fire.

491
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:15,917
That's it.
Go to your room.

492
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,120
Now.

493
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:24,336
Foot is down.
The foot is down.

494
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,872
Good job, gentlemen.
That could've been a disaster.

495
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,025
Well, that was a disaster.

496
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,567
Come.
Fly with me, criancinha

497
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,597
- Ah.
- Ahh.

498
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:51,919
We're gonna walk
out there, on that?

499
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:53,617
It's the quickest way back.

500
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:58,234
But it's right over the Memory Dump.
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

501
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,116
We have to do this for Riley.

502
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,408
Just follow my footsteps.

503
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:05,608
Not that high.
It's totally,  ah.

504
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:15,514
Wooah.

505
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,257
Hey.

506
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,970
So...

507
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,654
Things got a little out
of hand downstairs.

508
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,790
You wanna talk about it?

509
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:33,581
Come on.
Where's my happy girl?

510
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,522
Monkey.
Woo-hoo.

511
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:39,497
Whoa!
He's trying to start up Goofball.

512
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:43,265
Come on.
Hoo-Haa.

513
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:55,592
Sadness!
Turn right back!

514
00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:24,809
What the?

515
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:43,562
I get it.
You need some alone time.

516
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,242
And we'll talk later.

517
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:54,827
- We have a major problem.
- Oh, Joy. Where are you?

518
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:57,873
We lost Goofball Island.

519
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:02,792
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

520
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:05,184
You can fixed this.
Right, Joy?

521
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:08,784
- I-I don't know.
-Oh.

522
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,662
But we have to try.
Okay, come on.

523
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:14,473
- Riley's gone to sleep.
- Oh.

524
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:17,853
Which is a good thing
If... When you think about it.

525
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,629
Because nothing else bad
can happen when she's asleep.

526
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,828
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

527
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:26,255
We'll just go across
Friendship Island.

528
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:30,200
- Oh, we'll never make it.
- No-no-no...

529
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,938
Don't obsess over the
way of life's problems

530
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,036
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies.

531
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:36,571
Oh Sadness.
We don't have time for this.

532
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:38,456
We'll just have to go around.

533
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,136
Take the scenic route.

534
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:42,681
Wait.
Joy, you can get lost in there.

535
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,123
- Think positive.
- Okay.

536
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:48,390
I'm positive you will
get lost in there.

537
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,333
That's long term memory.

538
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:52,674
An endless swarm of corridors and shelves.

539
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,387
I read about it in the manuals.

540
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:58,308
The manuals?
The manuals.

541
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,081
- You read the manuals.
- Yeah.

542
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,328
So you know the way back
to headquarters.

543
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:06,605
- I guess.
- Woo-Hnn!

544
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,961
You are my map.

545
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,219
Let's go.
Lead on, my map.

546
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,391
Show me where we're going.

547
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,386
Okay, only.

548
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:15,144
I'm too sad to walk.

549
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:19,671
Just give me a few hours to...

550
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:22,704
- Which way, left?
- Right.

551
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:26,275
No, I mean go left.
I said left was right like correct.

552
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,342
Okay.

553
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:29,646
This actually feels kind of nice.

554
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:33,490
Okay, here we go.
We'll be back to Headquarters before morning.

555
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:35,542
We can do it.
This will be easy!

556
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,028
This is working.

557
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,642
This is not working.

558
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:45,405
- Are we getting close?
- Yeah. Just another right.

559
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:49,618
And a left.
And then another left.

560
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:52,536
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

561
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:55,937
'Cause we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

562
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,291
Oh.
Riley's awake.

563
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:00,936
Oh.
Oh. uh.

564
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,749
Don't.
Don't touch, remember?

565
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:06,356
If you touch them,
they stay sad.

566
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,700
Oh. Sorry.
I... I won't.

567
00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:12,333
- Starting now.
- I can't take much more of this.

568
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:13,905
Forget them!

569
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,590
- Mind workers.
- But, Joy, we're almost oh.

570
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:19,466
Phone numbers.
We don't need all these.

571
00:32:19,494 --> 00:32:20,466
They're in her phone.

572
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,814
- Just forget all that, please.
- Excuse me. Hi.

573
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,076
Forget it.

574
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:27,307
- I need to find Friendship Island.
- Look at this. 4 years of piano lessons.

575
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:28,398
Yeah.
It looks pretty faded.

576
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:31,572
You know what. Save Chopsticks and
Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

577
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,720
- Are you.
- US presidents. What do you think?

578
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,619
Just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

579
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:36,984
- Forget them!
- Hey!

580
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:39,540
You can't throw those away.
Those are perfectly good memories.

581
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:41,963
The names of every
Cutiepie princess doll?

582
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,914
Yes.
That is critical information.

583
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:46,723
- Glitter storm, Honey pants...
- Forget them.

584
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,089
- Hey! Bring those back.
- They're in the Dump.

585
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:56,411
- Nothing comes back from the Dump.
- Yeah. Look, lady. This is our job, okay.

586
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:58,619
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

587
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,202
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

588
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:04,564
Except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade

589
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:07,644
The song from the
gum commercial?

590
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:09,908
You know. Sometimes we send that one
up to Headquarters for no reason.

591
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:14,312
It just plays in Rileys head over
and over again like a million times.

592
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:16,599
Let's watch it again.

593
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:20,120
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay, real catchy.

594
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,559
- Hey. What do you think, should we do it?
- Yeah.

595
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,735
Okay. Here we go!
Ha-ha-ha.

596
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,127
What the?
This again?

597
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:31,337
Ha.
Great.

598
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:34,675
Wait! Do you know how to
get to Friendship Island!

599
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,364
Do you like it there?
Did you feel any earthquakes?

600
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:38,553
Is the bridge cool?

601
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:40,978
Yes. Good.
What happened with the playoffs.

602
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:44,367
We won the first game. Coach says we
might actually go to the finals this year.

603
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:47,456
Oh, and we got this new girl
 on the team. She's so cool.

604
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:49,990
- Uh. She did not just say that.
- A new girl?

605
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:52,201
Mag has a new friend already?

606
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:53,523
Hey-hey.
Stay happy.

607
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,755
We do not want to lose
anymore islands here, guys.

608
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,019
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

609
00:33:58,044 --> 00:33:59,509
It's like mind reading.

610
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:00,901
You like to read minds, Mag.

611
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,141
- I got something for you to read.
- Anger. What?

612
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,151
- Right here! - Wait-wait-wait.
Let's just be calm for 1 second.

613
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,591
Aw!.

614
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:07,222
- I got to got.
- What?

615
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:09,081
I got to go.

616
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,933
Wait. Could you just please
tell me which way is.

617
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,609
Oh no.

618
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,473
Friendship Island.
What?

619
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,776
Not Friendship.

620
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:42,634
Oh, Riley love that one.
And now it's gone.

621
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,829
Goodbye Friendship
Hello Loneliness.

622
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:52,765
We'll just have to go the long way.

623
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,527
Yeah.
The long long long... way.

624
00:34:58,552 --> 00:35:00,569
I'm ready.

625
00:35:01,343 --> 00:35:04,279
There's got to be a better way.

626
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:08,401
- Woo. Well look at you.
- Huh?

627
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:11,129
I will take you
but not you.

628
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:13,563
Ah! Who am I kidding.
I can't leave you.

629
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:14,938
Hello!

630
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:17,452
- Aw.
- Wait. Hey, wait.

631
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,778
No, wait.
Stop.

632
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,021
- Excuse me.
- Aw!

633
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,881
Oh.
I was, I was looking for

634
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,202
- diversion!
- What?

635
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:36,725
Ha ha!
So long, sucker.

636
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:38,492
Ou.
I'm hurt all over.

637
00:35:38,517 --> 00:35:40,155
Wait, I know you.

638
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,575
No, you don't.
I get that a lot.

639
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,479
- I look like a lot of people.
- No no no... I do.

640
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:48,277
Bing Bong,
Riley's imaginary friend.

641
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:50,765
- You really do know me?
- Of course.

642
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,462
Riley loved playings with you.
You two were best friends.

643
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,836
Oh, oh.
You wouldn't know.

644
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,028
- We're trying to get back to Headquarters.
- Headquarters?

645
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,682
- You guys are from Headquarters?
- Well, yeah.

646
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,196
I'm Joy.
This is Sadness.

647
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:03,254
- You're Joy, the Joy?
- Uh-huh.

648
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:04,896
What the heck
are you doing out here?

649
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,695
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

650
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:10,455
Without you,
I won't ever be happy.

651
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,483
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

652
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:14,532
I'll tell you what.
Follow me.

653
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:17,305
Thank you. It is
so great to see you again.

654
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,785
I got to tell you.
I'm such a huge fan of your work.

655
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,251
Do you remember when
you and Riley were in a band?

656
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:24,659
Ha-ha-ha.
I went to all of your concerts.

657
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,095
Yeah.
I blow a mean nose.

658
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,987
- Watching you play tag was such a treat.
- 2 time room champ.

659
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:33,265
- Oh, and remember your rockets.
- Of course, it runs on song power.

660
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,727
That's right.
Your theme song.

661
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,409
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

662
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:40,912
- His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
- Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

663
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:43,275
What exactly are you
suppose to be?

664
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,307
You know what's unclear?
I'm mostly cotton candy. But.

665
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,887
Shape wise. I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

666
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,539
Dolphin?

667
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,796
You got to remember. When Riley
was 3, animals were all her age.

668
00:36:57,821 --> 00:36:59,725
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

669
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,207
It's all the people
talked back then.

670
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:02,815
Yeah, yeah.
I guess that true.

671
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,271
- What are you doing out here?
- Well.

672
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:07,490
There's not much call for
imaginary friends lately.

673
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:11,280
So, I.
You know...

674
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:14,002
Yeah, yeah,
Don't be sad.

675
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:16,103
Tell you what.
When I get back up to Headquarters.

676
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,415
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

677
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,845
- You will?
- Of course. She loved that.

678
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,903
Ha-ha!
This is the greatest day of my life.

679
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,156
Aw aw aw...

680
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:31,241
- Are you okay?
- Hey, what's going on?

681
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,600
I cry candy.

682
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,336
- Try the caramel, it's delicious.
- Woo.

683
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:36,787
- Whoa!
- Woo.

684
00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:38,385
- Here use this.
- Thanks.

685
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,413
Oh, hold on.
Wait a second.

686
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:45,933
It always get stuck
at the bottom.

687
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,177
Here.

688
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,919
What?
It's imaginary.

689
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:53,908
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to Headquarters.

690
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:55,594
Walk?
We're not walking.

691
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,234
We're taking the Train of Thought.

692
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,384
The Train.
Of course.

693
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:04,030
That is so much fast.
But how do we catch it.

694
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:08,499
Well, it kind of go all over the place
but there is a station in Imagination Land.

695
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:11,103
I know a shortcut.
Come on, this way.

696
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:13,810
Oh. I'm so glad
we ran into you.

697
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,627
The station is right in here.
After you.

698
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:18,132
- Joy.
- What?

699
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:21,405
Well. I read about this place in the
manual. We shouldn't go in there.

700
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,347
Bing Bong says it's the
quickest way to Headquarters.

701
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,582
No. But Joy,
this is abstract thought.

702
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,943
What are you talking about?
I go in here all the time.

703
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:29,728
It's a shortcut.
You see.

704
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:32,420
(DANGER - Keep Out!)

705
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,251
I'll prove it to you.

706
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:35,772
Look at me.

707
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:39,838
I'm crossing into the station.
'Cause I'm taking the shortcut.

708
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,687
Let's. Let's go around.
This way.

709
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:44,110
Almost there.

710
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,877
If you want to walk
the long way, go for it.

711
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:50,601
But Riley needs to be happy.
I'm not missing that Train.

712
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:54,083
Bing Bong knows what he is doing.
He's part dolphin, they're very smart.

713
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:56,611
Well, I guess.

714
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:18,426
Okay. What abstract concept are we
trying to comprehend today.

715
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:20,009
- Loneliness.
- Hm.

716
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:21,671
I think there is
something in there.

717
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:24,266
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the dumb thoughts.

718
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,299
What did I tell ya.
You'll be in Headquarters in no time.

719
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:30,062
Hey, will you look at that?

720
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:33,182
- Whoa. What's happening?
- Oh no, they turned it on.

721
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,893
Oh.
Never seen this before.

722
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:41,307
My face. My beautiful face.
Whoa!

723
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:43,128
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting.

724
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:45,198
There are 4 stages.
This is the first.

725
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:47,176
Nonobjective fragmentation.

726
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:51,282
Alright, do not panic. What's
important is that we all stay together.

727
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,313
- Oh.
- Aw.

728
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:55,078
We're in the second stage.
We’re deconstructing.

729
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:56,693
Run!

730
00:39:56,718 --> 00:40:00,081
Aw.
I can't feel my legs.

731
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,847
- Oh, there they are.
- Come here, me.

732
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:08,058
We got to get out of here.
Before we're not even shape and color

733
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,823
We'll get stuck here forever

734
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,544
Bong.
Why did we come in here?

735
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:14,455
I told you.
It's a shortcut.

736
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,053
The Train.

737
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:23,488
Oh no. We're 2 dimensional.
That's stage 3.

738
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:26,181
- We're getting no where.
- Death. Unlucky death.

739
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,764
Come on.

740
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,219
We can't fit.

741
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:35,826
Oh no, we're not figurative
This is the last stage.

742
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,952
We're not gonna make it.

743
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,675
Wait, we're 2 dimensional.
Fall on your face.

744
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:56,652
Stop.
Stop!

745
00:40:57,951 --> 00:41:00,158
No.
You said that was a shortcut.

746
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:03,284
I did. But wow,
we should not had gone in there.

747
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:05,552
That was dangerous.
They should really put up a sign.

748
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:07,822
- How long till the next Train?
- Who knows?

749
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:10,405
But don’t worry.
There's another station. That way.

750
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,688
The Train always stops there,
right before it goes to Headquarters.

751
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:15,712
If we hurry,
we can catch it.

752
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:17,926
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

753
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:20,566
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah.

754
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:24,290
- Is there really another station?
- Uh-huh. Through there.

755
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:30,265
- Welcome to Imagination Land.
- Imagination Land?

756
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,956
Sure. I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

757
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:36,625
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fries Forest.

758
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,814
No way!
Ha-ha-ha.

759
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:41,147
Check it out.
Trophy Town.

760
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:44,916
Medals,  Ribbons.
Everyone's a winner.

761
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:46,547
I won first prize.

762
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:49,594
- Me too!
- Oh. Participation award.

763
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,517
Wait, is that?
Is that a? Look.

764
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,212
It's Cloud Town.

765
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:55,119
That's my favorite.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

766
00:41:55,144 --> 00:41:58,063
- Oh, it's so soft.
- Oh oh oh. Let me try.

767
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:00,160
Hey!
What the big idea?

768
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,939
You better fix that wall or else
you're in big trouble.

769
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,936
Oh no, lava.
Woo. Whoa.

770
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,911
Imagination Land is the best.

771
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,972
Oh, is it all going
to be so interactive.

772
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:16,182
Hey look!
The House of Cards.

773
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:18,818
Woo wait.
Hang on just a minute.

774
00:42:18,843 --> 00:42:20,150
- Your rocket.
- Yeah.

775
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:21,990
I stashed it in there
for safekeeping.

776
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:25,507
And now I'm all set
to take Riley to the moon!

777
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,553
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Great.

778
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,553
- Whoa. I love Imagination Land.
- Isn't it great?

779
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,928
And there's always
something new like...

780
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:38,066
- Who the heck is that?
- Imaginary boyfriend.

781
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,367
- I would die for Riley.
- Whoa.

782
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,427
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

783
00:42:43,452 --> 00:42:47,245
Anyway. Through Preschool World.
We're nearly to the train.

784
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,825
Riley, here we come.
Woo-Hoo. Ha-ha-ha.

785
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:54,961
This should be fun.
New team. New friends.

786
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:56,361
There kids looked pretty good.

787
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:59,381
Considering they're from
San Francisco. Heh-heh-heh.

788
00:42:59,406 --> 00:43:02,472
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie.

789
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,588
Look, kissing isn't going to help us now.If she
tries to use Hockey Island. It's going down.

790
00:43:05,613 --> 00:43:09,254
Which is why, I recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

791
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:11,851
One of these is got to work
in place of a core memory.

792
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:14,562
- She's about to play.
- Hurry.

793
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:23,700
Ha ha. We did it gang.
It's working.

794
00:43:23,725 --> 00:43:25,233
Oh.

795
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:38,078
Hahaha.
No-no-no... Aw!

796
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:45,019
It's like we don't learn anything.

797
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:52,461
- That's it.
- No no no.

798
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:54,309
Free on your happy place.

799
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,931
Aw!

800
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:08,404
- Riley, what's wrong?
- Let's go.

801
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:10,570
- You're not going to finish try outs?
- What's the point?

802
00:44:10,595 --> 00:44:12,719
Hey.
It will be alright.

803
00:44:12,744 --> 00:44:15,887
- Let's just go back.
- Stop saying everything will be alright.

804
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,242
Hockey!

805
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,835
Oh no no.
She loves hockey.

806
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,340
She can't give up hockey.

807
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:39,827
Bing Bong,
we have to get to that station.

808
00:44:39,852 --> 00:44:42,327
Sure thing. This way,
just past Grand Cracker Castle.

809
00:44:42,352 --> 00:44:44,070
Hey.
That's weird.

810
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:47,302
Grand Cracker Castle used to be right here.
I wonder why they moved it.

811
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:50,621
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pointy Mountain was right here.

812
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,240
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah yeah. I don't know.

813
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:55,301
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess Dreamworld

814
00:44:56,938 --> 00:45:00,534
Oh,
The Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame.

815
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,238
My rocket?

816
00:45:03,263 --> 00:45:06,185
Wait.
Riley and I were still using that rocket.

817
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,123
It still has some song power left.

818
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:10,546
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

819
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:17,963
No!
No no.

820
00:45:17,988 --> 00:45:22,277
You can't take my rocket to the Dump.
Riley and I are going to the moon.

821
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,020
Riley can't be done with me?

822
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:38,970
Hey, it's going to be okay.
We can fix this.

823
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:42,408
We just need to get back to Headquarters.
Which way to the Train station?

824
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:45,898
I had a whole trip
planned for us.

825
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:51,548
Hey, who's ticklish.
Here comes the tickle monster.

826
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:54,201
Hey.
Bing Bong, look at this.

827
00:45:56,709 --> 00:45:59,428
Oh, here's a fun game.
You point to the Train station

828
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:03,222
and we all go there.
Won't that be fun?

829
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,872
Come on,
let's go to the Train station.

830
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:09,801
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

831
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:14,473
They took something that you loved.
It's gone, forever.

832
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:17,593
- Sadness, don't make him feel worse.
- Sorry.

833
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:20,055
It's all I had left with Riley.

834
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,979
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

835
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,052
Oh, they were wonderful.

836
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:29,137
Once, we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

837
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:33,221
- Sadness.
- It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

838
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:37,494
Oh, she did.
We were best friends.

839
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,473
Yeah.
Yeah.

840
00:46:45,173 --> 00:46:46,729
What?

841
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:53,823
I'm okay now.

842
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:58,651
Come on.
The Train station is this way.

843
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:06,568
- How did you do that?
- Oh, I don't know.

844
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:09,917
- I feel sad so I listen to what...
- Hey!

845
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:12,113
There's the Train.

846
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:26,827
Oh, we made it. We're
finally going to get home.

847
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:30,611
Oh no.
These facts and opinions look so similar.

848
00:47:30,636 --> 00:47:33,708
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

849
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:40,035
On a scale of 1 to 10.
I give this day an 'F'.

850
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,934
Well, why don't we quit standing
around and do something.

851
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:46,243
- Like what, genius?
- Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

852
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:51,368
Sure. It's the coward's way out.
But this coward is gonna survive.

853
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:00,396
Emotions can't quit, genius.

854
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:04,269
Ewg. I thought we're
suppose to keep Riley happy

855
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,806
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

856
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,713
Uh-huh!
H0 ho ho...

857
00:48:11,738 --> 00:48:13,325
- What is it?
- Oh nothing.

858
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,588
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

859
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:18,321
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

860
00:48:18,346 --> 00:48:21,436
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more.

861
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:22,596
- Ta-dah.
- Wait wait wait.

862
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:24,607
You're say we
run away?

863
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:26,026
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

864
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:28,861
I call it the 'Happy core
memory development program'.

865
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:31,466
- You can't be serious.
- Hey, our life was perfect.

866
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,703
Until Mon and Dad decided to
move to San Fran stincko.

867
00:48:35,728 --> 00:48:37,729
But, I mean.
It's just so drastic.

868
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:40,245
Need I remind you of how
great things were there.

869
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:44,031
Our room. Our backyard.
Our friends.

870
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:48,751
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

871
00:48:48,776 --> 00:48:50,310
Anyway, it was better.
That's my point.

872
00:48:50,335 --> 00:48:53,730
- Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.
- Wait. Hold on.

873
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:55,415
Should we just sleep
on this or something?

874
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,925
Fine, let's sleep on it.

875
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:03,204
But, hey. I'm sure joyly fun-filled
times are just around the corner.

876
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:10,251
Huh?

877
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,960
Hey hey.
Why aren't we moving?

878
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:18,447
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

879
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:20,298
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

880
00:49:20,323 --> 00:49:22,423
Yeah. The Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

881
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:25,120
- Oh, we can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up.

882
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:28,806
Sadness, that's ridiculous.
How can we possibly...

883
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:32,626
- How about we wake her up.
- Great idea Joy.

884
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:34,183
Thanks, come on.

885
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,214
Production of
Dreams

886
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,935
Whoa. This place is huge.

887
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,851
It looks so much smaller
than I expected.

888
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:48,435
Wow, I can fly.
I love that one.

889
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:51,696
Rainbow Unicorn.
She's right there.

890
00:49:54,086 --> 00:49:56,007
My friend says you're famous.

891
00:49:56,032 --> 00:49:57,935
- She wants your autograph.
- No no, Sadness.

892
00:49:57,964 --> 00:49:59,847
Don't bother Miss. Unicorn, okay?

893
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:03,711
Sorry she's from out of town.
It's so embarrassing, right?

894
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:08,257
I love you in Fairy Dream Adventure part 7.
Okay bye. I love you.

895
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:09,512
[No Entry When
The Light Is On]

896
00:50:09,537 --> 00:50:13,249
Huh! Wonder what that means?
Oh well, let's go in.

897
00:50:14,632 --> 00:50:16,297
Set up the classroom set.

898
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:19,273
Today's memories are in.
We've got a lot to work with here.

899
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:23,437
Riley dumped her best friend, had a
miserable day at school and quit hockey.

900
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:26,001
The writers had put
together a killer script.

901
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:30,424
Just because Joy and Sadness are gone,
I have the stupid dream duty.

902
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,142
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

903
00:50:33,173 --> 00:50:36,155
Well. She wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

904
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,899
- We could scare her.
- Scare her?

905
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:40,253
- No no. She's been though enough already.
- But, Joy.

906
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:41,776
Sadness, you may know your
way around down here.

907
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:43,211
But I know Riley.

908
00:50:43,236 --> 00:50:46,706
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration

909
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:50,344
- We'll excite her awake.
- That's never happen before.

910
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:52,140
Woo, Riley loves dogs.
Put this on.

911
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:53,261
I don't think that will work.

912
00:50:53,286 --> 00:50:54,807
- Bing Bong.
- Yeah.

913
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:58,716
- Don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

914
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,349
Uh-huh.
Add the reality distortion filter.

915
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:06,143
Love it. Remember, play
to the camera everyone.

916
00:51:06,168 --> 00:51:08,492
Riley is the camera.
Make them get out of there.

917
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:12,452
We are on in
5 4 3...

918
00:51:13,493 --> 00:51:18,891
Hello class.
Before we begin today’s pop quiz...

919
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,840
And she is one bad actress

920
00:51:23,444 --> 00:51:26,842
I want to introduce our new student.

921
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:29,972
Riley. Would you like
to stand up and introduce

922
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,428
- Camera.
- ... yourself.

923
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,861
And, to Riley.

924
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:36,455
My name is Riley Anderson.

925
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,987
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

926
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:42,832
Ew. Look, her teeth
are falling out.

927
00:51:43,764 --> 00:51:44,810
Ew, gross.

928
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:48,323
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

929
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:50,574
Let me guess.
We've no pants on.

930
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,843
Hey, look. She came to
school with no pants on.

931
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:54,432
Called it!

932
00:51:54,457 --> 00:51:57,130
- Ready? I don't think this
happy thing is going to work.

933
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,409
- But if we scare her.
- Just follow my lead.

934
00:51:59,434 --> 00:52:00,829
Here we go.

935
00:52:00,854 --> 00:52:03,788
Aruu.
Bark-bark-bark.

936
00:52:03,813 --> 00:52:07,175
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

937
00:52:12,377 --> 00:52:14,770
Psst, you're on.
Go.

938
00:52:14,795 --> 00:52:18,388
Woo. Let's party.
Let's dance. Woo.

939
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:20,554
Hey.
A party.

940
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,131
Bark-bark-bark.

941
00:52:22,156 --> 00:52:25,199
Joy, this is not working.

942
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,409
No.

943
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:30,996
Huh.

944
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:33,781
Huh.  Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here.

945
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:38,143
It's just a dream. It's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

946
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:42,473
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security.

947
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:46,087
- Hi Riley, it's me.
- Bing Bong?

948
00:52:50,613 --> 00:52:52,334
Sadness.
You are ruining this dream.

949
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:54,844
- You're scaring her.
- But look. It's working.

950
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:56,256
Whoa.

951
00:52:56,281 --> 00:52:58,829
They're not part of this dream.
Get them.

952
00:52:58,854 --> 00:53:00,721
Stop right there!

953
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:04,006
Pan away.
Pan away.

954
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:09,703
Boo.
Peek and Poke line.

955
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,433
Aw, careful.

956
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,820
You can't do this.
I know people in Headquarters.

957
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:26,775
No-no-no...

958
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,140
There go the core memories.

959
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:33,374
Come on.

960
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,222
- What is this place?
- The subconscious.

961
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:40,420
That's where they take
all the troublemakers.

962
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:45,826
My hat feels loose.

963
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:47,663
How do we get in?

964
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,310
- Is that your hat?
- Yeah, it's my hat.

965
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:53,342
You sure, I don't know.
Look at the label.

966
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:54,440
Yeah, it says my hat.

967
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,553
- Wait. It says my hat?
- My hat, it says.

968
00:53:56,578 --> 00:53:58,268
- That's what I wrote in my hat.
- What are you talking about?

969
00:53:58,293 --> 00:54:01,043
- Look. You got my hat on.
- Okay, it's my hat.

970
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:03,964
- Hey you.
- Oh, you caught us.

971
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:07,526
Get back in there.
No escaping.

972
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:12,705
Oh.

973
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:21,372
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

974
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:25,358
It's broccoli.

975
00:54:27,212 --> 00:54:29,646
The stairs to the biggest smite.

976
00:54:31,084 --> 00:54:34,744
Grandma's vacuum cleaner.
Aw!

977
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,633
Okay, come on.

978
00:54:44,577 --> 00:54:47,215
- Would you walk quieter.
- I'm trying.

979
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,961
What is going...

980
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,277
Candy wrappers.

981
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:04,682
- Bing Bong.
- Joy?

982
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:07,650
- There you are.
- Shh.

983
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:14,294
Who's the person...

984
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:28,638
- Do you have the core memories?
- Yeah.

985
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:31,771
All he cared about
was the candy.

986
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:33,695
Shh.

987
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:51,539
We're outta here.
Let's get to that Train.

988
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:55,544
Wait. The Train is not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

989
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:57,420
But how?

990
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,704
Oh no.

991
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:23,499
Hey Sadness. Did you hear
about the party they were having.

992
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:28,060
Yeah, yes Joy.
Isn't it a bir-bir-birthday party?

993
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:31,334
Did you say birthday?

994
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,426
- And there's going to be cake and presents.
- And games and balloons.

995
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:36,150
A Birthday!

996
00:56:36,175 --> 00:56:38,496
Okay.
Follow us.

997
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:42,017
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

998
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,612
- Okay, it's my hand writing.
- No, it isn't.

999
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:46,896
- It's my hat. I wrote that.
- No, this one's my hat.

1000
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:08,945
- Who's the birthday girl?
- Aw!

1001
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,887
- Woo-hoo.
- Come on, let's go.

1002
00:57:20,975 --> 00:57:23,590
- Ha ha. We made it.
- Ha ha.

1003
00:57:23,615 --> 00:57:27,730
- Guess who's on their way to Headquarters.
- We are.

1004
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:36,717
- What is going on?
- He did it again.

1005
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:39,326
We were at school. And we were naked.
And there was a dog.

1006
00:57:39,357 --> 00:57:41,811
The back half was...
It was- It was chasing it, I mean.

1007
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:44,672
- There was a Bing Bong.
- You idiot. It was a dream.

1008
00:57:44,697 --> 00:57:48,758
This is ridiculous. We can't even
get a good night sleep anymore.

1009
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:50,648
Time to take action.

1010
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,840
Stupid Mon and Dad.
If they hadn't move us

1011
00:57:52,865 --> 00:57:54,671
none of this would have happen.

1012
00:57:54,696 --> 00:57:56,479
Who's with me?

1013
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:02,009
Yeah.
Let's do it.

1014
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:15,951
She took it.
There's no turning back.

1015
00:58:15,976 --> 00:58:18,557
So. How are we going to
get to Minnesota from here.

1016
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:21,646
Well. Why don't we go down to the
elephant lot and rent an elephant.

1017
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:23,035
Hey, that sounds nice.

1018
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,713
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1019
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:28,715
There is a bus leaving
tomorrow, perfect.

1020
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,159
A ticket cost money.
How do we get money?

1021
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:33,169
- Mom's purse.
- Oh. You wouldn't.

1022
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:36,922
Oh, but I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1023
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:39,865
- No!
- Aw!

1024
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,342
It's downstairs somewhere.

1025
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:45,273
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.
They can pay to get us out.

1026
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:49,618
How about this...
Isn't this nice?

1027
00:58:49,643 --> 00:58:51,625
You can see everything
from up here.

1028
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,054
Look. There's Inductive Reasoning.
There's Deja Vu.

1029
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,851
There's Language Processing.
There's Deja Vu.

1030
00:58:57,876 --> 00:59:00,764
There's Critical Thinking.
There's Deja Vu.

1031
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:03,040
And look at this guy's memories.

1032
00:59:03,796 --> 00:59:06,207
Hey.
That was a good idea.

1033
00:59:06,232 --> 00:59:08,440
About scaring Riley awake.

1034
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:11,775
- You're not so bad.
- Really?

1035
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,362
Nice work.

1036
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:16,289
I can't wait to get
the old Riley back.

1037
00:59:16,314 --> 00:59:19,279
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1038
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:21,053
Whoa.
Is this Riley?

1039
00:59:21,078 --> 00:59:23,472
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1040
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:24,914
How're we gonna
get to the moon.

1041
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:27,859
Oh. It's that time in the
Twistee Treat, remember?

1042
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:31,960
The hockey team showed up and
Mon and Dad were there cheering.

1043
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,250
Look at her.
Having fun and laughing.

1044
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:39,306
- I love this one.
- I love that one too.

1045
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:42,197
- Atta girl. Now you're getting it.
- Yeah.

1046
00:59:42,222 --> 00:59:45,684
It was the day the Prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1047
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:50,651
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful, she wanted to quit.

1048
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,926
Sorry.
I went sad again, didn't I?

1049
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:59,185
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back, okay?

1050
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,948
Okay.

1051
01:00:02,296 --> 01:00:04,498
I just don't understand.

1052
01:00:06,226 --> 01:00:09,161
Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?

1053
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:15,223
Multiple customer.

1054
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:24,911
Well, we were promised
delivery on the 5th.

1055
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:29,499
Uh-huh.

1056
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:38,135
Excuse me. Isn't there any way
you think you can even rush it.

1057
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:44,571
Honesty Island?

1058
01:00:52,943 --> 01:00:54,358
Look out!

1059
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:56,084
Aw!

1060
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:01,201
Come on!

1061
01:01:05,426 --> 01:01:06,935
Hold on!

1062
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,068
- Hurry up.
- Join over here.

1063
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:10,646
- Go-go-go.
- I got it.

1064
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,283
- Pull.
- Pull.

1065
01:01:22,918 --> 01:01:24,458
That was our way home.

1066
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:27,088
We lost another island.
What is happening?

1067
01:01:27,113 --> 01:01:30,525
Haven't you heard?
Riley is running away.

1068
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,955
What?

1069
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:35,342
Wait wait.
Hang on, guys.

1070
01:01:35,367 --> 01:01:38,269
Are we really doing this?
This is serious.

1071
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,067
Look.
We have no core memories.

1072
01:01:40,092 --> 01:01:41,390
You want Riley to be happy?

1073
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:44,817
Let's go back to Minnesota
and make more.

1074
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:48,608
Joy. If we hurry,
we can still stop her.

1075
01:01:49,483 --> 01:01:51,836
Family Island.
Let's go.

1076
01:02:05,737 --> 01:02:07,048
Joy.

1077
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:11,380
Joy. It's too dangerous.
We won't make it in time.

1078
01:02:14,138 --> 01:02:16,197
But, that's our only way back.

1079
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:30,108
A recall tube.

1080
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:34,123
We can get recall.

1081
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:39,382
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1082
01:02:39,407 --> 01:02:43,247
- See you after school, monkey.
- We love you.

1083
01:02:46,731 --> 01:02:48,848
Go, run run!
Go!

1084
01:02:58,465 --> 01:03:00,050
Whoa whoa,
Sadness.

1085
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:02,061
Sadness.
Stop.

1086
01:03:02,464 --> 01:03:06,039
- You're hurting Riley.
- No no no. I did it again.

1087
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:10,392
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1088
01:03:15,242 --> 01:03:16,842
I'm sorry.

1089
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:20,472
- Riley needs to be happy.
- Joy?

1090
01:03:29,756 --> 01:03:32,962
Aww!

1091
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:37,491
Joy.
Aw!

1092
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,755
Joy!

1093
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,080
Joy?

1094
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:23,325
Joy!

1095
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,438
Joy. Joy, what're you doing?
Would you stop it, please.

1096
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:40,134
Don't you get it, Joy.
We're stuck down here.

1097
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,391
We're forgotten.

1098
01:05:33,188 --> 01:05:39,463
Do you remember, how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring.

1099
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:52,594
I could listen to
her stories all day

1100
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:08,787
I just wanted
Riley to be happy.

1101
01:07:09,141 --> 01:07:13,199
It was the day the Prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1102
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,192
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1103
01:07:17,217 --> 01:07:19,652
 She wanted to quit.

1104
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,828
Sadness.

1105
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:43,953
Mom and Dad.
The team.

1106
01:07:43,978 --> 01:07:48,600
They came to help
because of sadness.

1107
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,980
We have to
get back up there.

1108
01:07:56,336 --> 01:07:59,404
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1109
01:07:59,429 --> 01:08:02,250
We might as well be
on another planet.

1110
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,603
Another planet.

1111
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:14,963
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1112
01:08:17,742 --> 01:08:20,728
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1113
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:24,736
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1114
01:08:27,014 --> 01:08:30,232
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say.

1115
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:33,235
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

1116
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,749
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1117
01:08:48,884 --> 01:08:50,549
Hop in.

1118
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:56,428
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

1119
01:08:56,453 --> 01:08:58,736
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1120
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:02,051
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say.

1121
01:09:04,579 --> 01:09:06,756
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1122
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:09,658
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say...

1123
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:11,514
Aww!

1124
01:09:16,363 --> 01:09:18,085
Come on!

1125
01:09:28,396 --> 01:09:29,703
Aw!

1126
01:09:31,896 --> 01:09:33,700
Aw.

1127
01:09:39,431 --> 01:09:41,403
Come on Joy, one more time.

1128
01:09:41,862 --> 01:09:43,808
I got a feeling on this one.

1129
01:09:44,705 --> 01:09:46,888
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1130
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:49,028
Who's the best in every way,
and wants to sing this song to say.

1131
01:09:49,053 --> 01:09:51,231
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong. Bing Bong.

1132
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:55,057
Louder! Louder!
Joy, sing louder!

1133
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:07,370
We're gonna make it.

1134
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,114
Woo-hoo.

1135
01:10:15,139 --> 01:10:17,667
Bing Bong,
we did it!

1136
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:19,985
We...
Bing Bong?

1137
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:21,535
Bing Bong!

1138
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,341
Ha ha! You made it!
Ha ha!

1139
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:29,499
Go! Go save Riley.
Ha ha ha.

1140
01:10:30,714 --> 01:10:35,175
Take her to the moon for me.
Okay?

1141
01:10:40,831 --> 01:10:42,285
Oh.

1142
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,006
Oh.

1143
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:51,060
I'll try, Bing Bong.

1144
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:54,854
I promise.

1145
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,741
We're home!

1146
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:14,071
Riley?
Riley?

1147
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,333
I'll call her cell.

1148
01:11:21,654 --> 01:11:23,277
Oh, this is terrible.

1149
01:11:23,302 --> 01:11:24,728
Wait. Is that someone
walking towards us?

1150
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:26,703
Look.
Let's cross the street.

1151
01:11:30,836 --> 01:11:32,490
It's Mom.
She's on to us.

1152
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:35,337
- What do we do? - Where's my bag?
- Riley needs to get core memories.

1153
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:37,470
We keep going.

1154
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:41,664
Sadness!

1155
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:54,016
Sadness?
Sadness?

1156
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,543
Come on, Sadness.
Where are you?

1157
01:11:56,568 --> 01:11:59,844
Okay. If I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1158
01:12:00,222 --> 01:12:04,405
Oh. Everything is awful
and my legs don't work.

1159
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:08,669
And you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1160
01:12:23,818 --> 01:12:25,894
Oh no. It's Mom again.
What do we do?

1161
01:12:25,919 --> 01:12:27,147
Uh.

1162
01:12:32,076 --> 01:12:34,409
This is madness.
She shouldn't run away.

1163
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:36,510
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

1164
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,499
Sadness?

1165
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:42,603
- Sadness.
- Joy?

1166
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:45,007
Wait.
Sadness.

1167
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:48,955
Just let me go. Riley is
better of without me.

1168
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,921
Come back!

1169
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:59,067
You're saying your husband was
blown away by an elephant.

1170
01:12:59,092 --> 01:13:01,625
- Was he with anyone?
- Yes. And there she is!

1171
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:02,973
Hey!
Come back here!

1172
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:06,116
Forget it Jake.
It's cloud talk.

1173
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:11,402
Sadness.

1174
01:13:11,427 --> 01:13:14,126
- I only make everything worse.
- Wait.

1175
01:13:14,153 --> 01:13:16,930
Sadness, we got to
get you back to...

1176
01:13:26,608 --> 01:13:27,929
- It's stuck.
- Oh, great. - What?

1177
01:13:27,954 --> 01:13:29,763
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1178
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:32,778
No-no-no.
What is this?

1179
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,408
- How do we stop it?
- I got it.

1180
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:44,740
Make her feel scared.
That will change her mind.

1181
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:46,716
- Brilliant.
- I know it's brilliant. Do it.

1182
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,599
Nothings working.
Why isn't it working?

1183
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,320
- Let me try.
- Wait. You broke it. - No.

1184
01:13:50,345 --> 01:13:52,861
- Move. Move.
- Let me do it. Get out of here.

1185
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,289
No.

1186
01:13:56,314 --> 01:14:00,273
Guys. We can't make
Riley feel anything.

1187
01:14:00,634 --> 01:14:03,050
What have we done?

1188
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:06,123
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Did you mean what you said before.

1189
01:14:06,148 --> 01:14:08,318
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1190
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:11,179
Yeah yeah. Okay, haircut.
Time to prove it.

1191
01:14:14,031 --> 01:14:16,874
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1192
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:19,454
I would die for Riley.
I would die for Riley.

1193
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,005
That's it.
I fold.

1194
01:14:54,113 --> 01:14:56,620
Whao...

1195
01:14:58,472 --> 01:14:59,902
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1196
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:04,042
Whoa.
Okay. Whoa.

1197
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:07,016
- Woo-woo-woo.
- Whoa.

1198
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:09,121
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

1199
01:15:09,146 --> 01:15:11,704
No no no.
Joy, be positive.

1200
01:15:14,716 --> 01:15:17,465
I'm positive this is crazy.

1201
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:21,929
Now!

1202
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:26,712
For Riley...
For Riley...

1203
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:33,756
- Joy?
- Hang on.

1204
01:15:34,403 --> 01:15:36,987
Oh, I wished Joy was here.

1205
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:47,953
Stand back.
Yah!

1206
01:15:48,422 --> 01:15:51,839
- That work.
- Well, what would you do if you're so smart.

1207
01:15:51,864 --> 01:15:54,972
I'll tell you.
But you're too dumb to understand.

1208
01:15:54,997 --> 01:15:57,250
- What!
- Of course your tiny brain is confuse.

1209
01:15:57,275 --> 01:16:00,290
Guess I'll just have to dumb it
down to your level.

1210
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:03,790
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you. But let me try.

1211
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,215
Duh.

1212
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:11,520
Awwww!

1213
01:16:14,105 --> 01:16:15,549
Oh.
Thank goodness you're back.

1214
01:16:15,574 --> 01:16:17,737
- Things are really messed up.
- We-we-we found this idea.

1215
01:16:17,762 --> 01:16:19,260
Oh no.

1216
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:30,829
Joy, you got to fix this.
Get out there.

1217
01:16:30,855 --> 01:16:33,301
- Sadness, it's up to you.
- Me?

1218
01:16:33,326 --> 01:16:35,206
- Sadness? - Sadness? - Sadness?

1219
01:16:35,234 --> 01:16:37,418
- I can't, Joy.
- Yes you can.

1220
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:39,995
Riley, needs you.

1221
01:16:51,105 --> 01:16:52,527
Okay.

1222
01:17:12,691 --> 01:17:15,899
Wait. Stop.
I want to get off.

1223
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:28,632
Alright.
Thank you, we will.

1224
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:31,208
- Her teacher hasn't even seen Riley all day.
- What?

1225
01:17:31,233 --> 01:17:32,229
What was she wearing last?

1226
01:17:32,254 --> 01:17:34,071
- Can't believe this.
- Do you even remember what...

1227
01:17:34,561 --> 01:17:35,679
- Riley.
- Hey. There you are.

1228
01:17:35,704 --> 01:17:36,878
- Thank goodness.
- Oh, we were worried sick.

1229
01:17:36,906 --> 01:17:38,766
- Where have you been? It's so late.
- Oh.

1230
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:41,442
Riley, what happened?
Are you alright.

1231
01:19:10,694 --> 01:19:14,180
I know you don't want me to.
But.

1232
01:19:15,124 --> 01:19:17,454
I missed home.

1233
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:20,885
I missed Minnesota.

1234
01:19:23,396 --> 01:19:26,024
You need me to be happy.

1235
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:27,400
But.

1236
01:19:28,355 --> 01:19:33,809
I want my old friends
and hockey team

1237
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,418
I want to go home.

1238
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:41,139
Please don't be mad.

1239
01:19:43,433 --> 01:19:46,925
- Oh, sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1240
01:19:47,858 --> 01:19:52,279
You know what?
I missed Minnesota too.

1241
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:56,619
I missed the woods
that we took hikes.

1242
01:19:56,741 --> 01:19:59,748
And the backyard where
you used to play.

1243
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:03,722
Spring lake.
Where you learned to skate.

1244
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,571
Come here.

1245
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:28,963
Hey.
I'm liking this new view.

1246
01:21:28,988 --> 01:21:30,527
Friendship Island has expanded.

1247
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,183
Glad they finally opened that
friendly argument section.

1248
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:35,287
I like
Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1249
01:21:35,316 --> 01:21:38,109
Fashion Island.
Everyone shut up.

1250
01:21:38,134 --> 01:21:40,272
Boy Band Island?
That's just a phase.

1251
01:21:40,297 --> 01:21:44,441
Say what you want.
I think it's all beautiful.

1252
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:45,736
Alright.
Here you go.

1253
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:48,805
Your new expanded console
is up and running.

1254
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,294
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1255
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,619
- Cool. Upgrade.
- Woo.

1256
01:21:51,644 --> 01:21:54,066
Aye, ho ho.
Whoops, did I just do that?

1257
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:56,797
Okay.
Guys, what is 'PUBERTY'.

1258
01:21:56,822 --> 01:21:58,727
I don't know.
It's probably not important.

1259
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:03,033
Whoa. I have access to the
entire curse word library.

1260
01:22:03,058 --> 01:22:06,207
This new console is the
...

1261
01:22:06,232 --> 01:22:07,941
Sorry. I did it again.
My bad.

1262
01:22:07,973 --> 01:22:09,794
They're getting to the rink.

1263
01:22:10,281 --> 01:22:12,453
Now, when you get out there.
You be aggressive.

1264
01:22:12,478 --> 01:22:14,092
- I know Dad.
- Not too aggressive.

1265
01:22:14,117 --> 01:22:16,953
You know. You guys don't have
to come to every game.

1266
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:19,130
Are you kidding?
I'm not missing one!

1267
01:22:19,155 --> 01:22:20,917
- Go Fog Horns!
- Go Riley!

1268
01:22:20,942 --> 01:22:22,212
- Fog.. Horns...
- Okay okay. - Fog Horns

1269
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,806
- I got to go.
- the best...

1270
01:22:24,831 --> 01:22:25,942
- Oh.
- They love us.

1271
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:27,646
Yeah. Mom and Dad
are pretty cool.

1272
01:22:27,671 --> 01:22:31,193
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1273
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,416
Yeh.
Yeh.

1274
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:33,814
She loved the face painting.

1275
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:36,259
Ha.
Told you it was a great idea.

1276
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,917
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1277
01:22:39,942 --> 01:22:41,786
- Ah.
- Oh.

1278
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,703
Just in case.

1279
01:22:46,988 --> 01:22:48,236
Oh.

1280
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:51,221
Sorry.

1281
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:54,689
- Aww!
- GIRL! GIRL!

1282
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:56,964
- Oh oh.
- GIRL!

1283
01:22:59,573 --> 01:23:02,290
Okay.
Bye.

1284
01:23:06,322 --> 01:23:08,212
Hey Riley.

1285
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:13,217
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1286
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:16,732
Alright.
Let's play some hockey.

1287
01:23:16,757 --> 01:23:19,053
- Alright, Anger. Take over.
- Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1288
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,146
On her left.
On her left!

1289
01:23:20,189 --> 01:23:21,743
Let's just try not to get
all smelly this time.

1290
01:23:21,768 --> 01:23:24,238
Oh. Mom and Dad
are watching us fail.

1291
01:23:24,264 --> 01:23:26,373
Not for long!

1292
01:23:27,223 --> 01:23:29,163
We've been through a lot
lately that's for sure.

1293
01:23:29,188 --> 01:23:31,386
But we sill love our girl.

1294
01:23:31,414 --> 01:23:33,970
She has great new friends
and great new house.

1295
01:23:33,995 --> 01:23:35,654
Things couldn't be better.

1296
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,301
After all, Riley is 12 now.

1297
01:23:38,326 --> 01:23:40,001
What could happen?

1298
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:00,938
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded.

1299
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:02,668
Anyone?

1300
01:24:02,692 --> 01:24:05,841
- Jordan.
- Uh.

1301
01:24:06,613 --> 01:24:08,129
How much more of this?

1302
01:24:08,162 --> 01:24:13,344
5 months 2 weeks and 4 days
until summer vacation.

1303
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:17,728
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who.

1304
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:22,248
Come.
Fly with me, criancinha

1305
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:24,493
- Ah.
- Ah.

1306
01:24:26,207 --> 01:24:28,969
Have a nice day.

1307
01:24:29,846 --> 01:24:31,484
What are we mad about?

1308
01:24:31,512 --> 01:24:33,830
I don't know.
Whatever Troy is mad about.

1309
01:24:33,854 --> 01:24:35,302
What's Troy mad about?

1310
01:24:35,327 --> 01:24:37,498
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1311
01:24:37,785 --> 01:24:40,004
I know, I told her that.

1312
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:43,982
We are a total fraud.
Do you think they can see through us.

1313
01:24:44,014 --> 01:24:46,352
Of course not.
We're wearing eye shadow.

1314
01:24:46,392 --> 01:24:49,619
Being cool is so exhausting.

1315
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:53,598
Who's the birthday girl?
Huh.

1316
01:24:53,623 --> 01:24:57,281
Hey.
Hello?

1317
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:03,479
6 years of drama school
for this.

1318
01:25:08,389 --> 01:25:10,748
- What?
- Let's move.

1319
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:12,553
Look. This is okay.
This is fine.

1320
01:25:12,578 --> 01:25:15,760
We just need to go
to our happy place.

1321
01:25:16,941 --> 01:25:19,547
- Aw!
- Aww!

1322
01:25:25,684 --> 01:25:27,221
It smells good.

1323
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,375
it will be good.

1324
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,604
It is good.
