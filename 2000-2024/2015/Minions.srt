"Minions 2015" ^ (Run time : 01:23:52)

2
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,234
Minions.

3
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:49,818
Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.

4
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,547
They go by many names.

5
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:55,177
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.

6
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:58,719
Oh, that one is Norbert.

7
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,929
He's an idiot.

8
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,884
They're all different.
But they all share the same goal.

9
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,212
To serve the most despicable master
they could find.

10
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:10,097
BOSS!

11
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:19,478
Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.

12
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,759
But that's not to say that
they didnâ€™t have other passions.

13
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,834
- Look. It's a banana.
- Move over.

14
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,243
It's a banana.
Ha-hah-ha.

15
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:32,238
Yum yum.
Huh?

16
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,746
Finding a Boss was easy.

17
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:39,831
But keeping a Boss...
therein lies the problem

18
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,914
Whoa!

19
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,154
Oh.

20
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,550
I am... oaf.
Aw.

21
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,796
Nope,
it wasn't easy for these guys.

22
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,201
But they never gave up.

23
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:30,281
With the emergence of the stone age
came the rise of a new species.

24
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:33,030
Man was very different 
from the dinosaur.

25
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:38,459
He was shorter, hairier
and way, way smarter.

26
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:49,234
The minions took an instant liking to Man
and helped him as best they could.

27
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:54,672
Oh, no no...
Here. A present.

28
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,318
- This?
- Yes yes yes.

29
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,702
For hitting.
Ut-ut.

30
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,300
Aw!

31
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:12,459
Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile, so-so delicious.

32
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:20,224
Their quest for a boss put the minions front and center
for some of the civilization most historic moments.

33
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,297
Ancient Egypt held great promise.

34
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,695


35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,239
Okay!

36
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,197


37
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:36,321
But it didn't last long.

38
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,034
Hmm.
Oh.

39
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,692
Here.
Yup.

40
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:40,944
Aw!

41
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:45,293
The dark ages
were actually fun times.

42
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:51,729
Their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day.

43
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,325
Ahem.
Yoo-hoo.

44
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,918


45
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,526
<font color="#ff9b9b">[Happy Anniversary]</font>

46
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:07,767
Oh.

47
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,882
Oh, eventually the party is over.

48
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,375
Achoo.

49
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,375
They bounce from 
one evil master to another.

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,022
But they never seemed 
to find their perfect fit.

51
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:27,230
One particular employer took
their failure very very badly.

52
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,111
The Minions had no other choice
but to keep moving.

53
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:49,767
And then,
when all hopes seem lost.

54
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:52,463
They found sanctuary.

55
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:56,099
The Minions were safe.

56
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:26,814
Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.

57
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,946
They truly made a life
for themselves.

58
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:33,019
But something just wasn't right.

59
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:42,549
They felt empty inside.
Without a master, they had no purpose.

60
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:44,439
They became aimless

61
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,862
and depressed.

62
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:56,406
If this continue any longer,
the Minions would perish.

63
00:06:57,437 --> 00:07:02,761
But all was not lost,
for one Minion had a plan.

64
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:06,207
His name was Kevin.

65
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,316
He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.

66
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:16,073
He'd been preparing for
days, weeks, months.

67
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:18,884
But now he was ready...

68
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,768
Kevin would leave the cave,
go back to the outside world

69
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:50,560
and he would not return until he had found
his tribe the biggest baddest villain deserved.

70
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:52,538
But he needed help.

71
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:55,065
Me! Me.
Choose me.

72
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,587
Bob was eager to go.
- Kevin?

73
00:07:56,612 --> 00:08:00,776
But Kevin felt he was just not strong enough
for the dangerous journey ahead.

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,996
Uh no.
One other Minion!

75
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,426
Me.
Choose me.

76
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,520
Me! Choose me!
Aw.

77
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:08,630
Me!

78
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,480
Come, choose me.

79
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,622
Luckily someone stepped up.

80
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,762
- Huh?
- Stuart! Come here.

81
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,991
Huh. Me? Me?
Oh, thank you.

82
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:19,923
Truth be told. Stuart had no idea
what he was chose for.

83
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,327
Huh!
Wh-Why?

84
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,594
But was thrilled that 
people cheered for him.

85
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,545
One more!

86
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,854
ME!
I am strong.

87
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:37,668
See here.

88
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:40,578
See!

89
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,212
- Oh.
- Oh.

90
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:45,615
Uh... okay.
One more.

91
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,532
Kevin.
Choose me.

92
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:50,449
Please.
Choose me, Kevin.

93
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,736
- Come here.
- Yeah! Ha ha.

94
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:55,143
Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm

95
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:59,777
but mostly lack of other volunteers
changed Kevin's mind.

96
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,581
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!

97
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:04,419
Kumbaya.

98
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,803
Big boss!
Big boss!

99
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,671
The tribe said their farewells.

100
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:11,313
Kevin had given them something
they haven't had  in a long time.

101
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,136
Hope.
- Kevin.

102
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:14,887
Bob.
(Big boss! Big boss!)

103
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:17,239
Hey.
Tony, good luck to you.

104
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,967
Tom.
Take care.

105
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,728
And Chris.
See you later.

106
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:25,379
- Hey Bob, you coming.
- Yes, yes.

107
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:28,513
Big boss!
Big boss!

108
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:31,099
Bye bye.

109
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:40,439
Kevin felt pride. He was going
to be the one to save his tribe.

110
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:43,496
Stuart felt,
hungry mostly.

111
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:46,706
He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.

112
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,188
- And Bob
- Oh.

113
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:54,603
Bob was frightened of the journey ahead.

114
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:56,456


115
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:12,564
And they were off.

116
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,041
Off, to find their new boss.

117
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,463
New York 1968

118
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,414
- Oh, look at that one.
- Whoa!

119
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,537
Whoa.
Look at that one.

120
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,786
- Peace!
- Make love, not war!

121
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:24,144
Peace to the world.

122
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,567
The store is now closing.

123
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:46,361
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

124
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:49,052
- Bob, where you?
- Get away from that.

125
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,854
Oh, Kevin.

126
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:03,615
And welcome back to
the Dating Game.

127
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,938
Well Jennifer.
Have you decided

128
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:09,764
which of these 3 gentlemen,
you'll go on a date with?

129
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:13,656
- Is it Bob?
- Yeah. Go Bob.

130
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,921
- Kevin.
- Look, it's Kevin.

131
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:20,427
- Or will it be Stuart?
- Oh. Yo, Stuart.

132
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:24,611
Gosh. This is so hard.
They all sounded so cute.

133
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,651
I think I'm going
to go with...

134
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,524
V... N... C...

135
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,967

- Criminal genius.

154
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:47,243
Oh yeah, far out.

155
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,687
Welcome to Wayne, buddy.

156
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:27,273
Oh, Walter look. These adorable little
freaks are heading to Orlando too.

157
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,794
Yeah, I see that.
Hey, Walter Junior.

158
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:31,638
- What's happening?
- Tina.
- Hi.

159
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:35,783
Pinkie. What do you say
we give these fellows a ride?

160
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:39,375
- New friends.
- All aboard the Nelson Express.

161
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,011
You, one eye,
You're sitting next to me.

162
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:54,882
Glad we came along before
some weirdos picked you up.

163
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:58,193
Who wants apple slices?

164
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,576
Oh, you too.

165
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:06,680
Growing of a... boy like...
creatures need their strength.

166
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,439
Yeah.

167
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,152
Thanks, man.

168
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,009
Alrighty.
Who needs to stretch their legs?

169
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,574
-Yeah!
- Me me me.

170
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,917
You wait right here.
We'll be right back.

171
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:23,051
Okay, Nelsons.
Let's do this.

172
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:33,611
Go.
Go go go.

173
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,199
Okey dokey, 
on the road again.

174
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,925
Dad, we got company.
It's because I tripped the alarm.

175
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,373
- I stink.
- Hey.

176
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:56,344
We all make mistakes, sugar plum.
You're still learning.

177
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,645
Whoa.
What!

178
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,709
- Your father's right, Tina.
-  Reload.

179
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:03,239
- He wasnâ€™t this good at being evil overnight.
- Reload.

180
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,306
Your time is coming.

181
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,050
Ah, it's jammed.

182
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,733
Huh?

183
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:46,943
- Okay, who did that?
- It's Stuart.

184
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:49,381
- But but.
- That was great.

185
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,566
Ha ha ha.
Thank you.

186
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:56,098
Say, fellows.
Can I get personal for a second?

187
00:21:56,123 --> 00:22:00,110
Why are you
going to Orlando?

188
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:05,026
Come on, you can tell us,
You're going to Villain-Con, aren't you?

189
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:06,314
Yes, Villain-Con.

190
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,946
Villain-Con.

191
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:10,497
Wow, so many bad guys in the car.

192
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:12,567
- What fun.
- I knew it.

193
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,623
I knew you were villains.
Didn't I, honey?

194
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:17,396
What a small world.
Hope we're not in rival gangs.

195
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,293
Heh heh heh.

196
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:20,981
Pinkie, don't.

197
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,715
Baby, huh?

198
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,752
When we get to Orlando, I'm going to get 
my favorite villains to sign my magazine.

199
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,816
Dumo the Sumo.

200
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:35,699
Oh, Kevin! You don't want to work for him.
He ate his last henchman.

201
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:40,146
Frankie Fishlips.
He lives in the ocean.

202
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:41,601
Uh.

203
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:45,096
- Can you breathe under water?
- So so.

204
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:48,353
Oh oh oh.
Look at her, Scarlet Overkill.

205
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:51,392
The coolest supervillain, like ever.

206
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:54,946
She started out as your average little girl.
Bracers, pig tails.

207
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:59,515
But, by the time she was 13,
She built a criminal empire.

208
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,945
If I was a Minion,
that's who I would work for.

209
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:10,767
- Here we are, a beautiful Orlando.
- Yeah, we're here!

210
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:16,709
<font color="#ffffae">Orlando
Coming soon!</font>

211
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:27,284
<font color="#ffffae">BAIT SHOP</font>

212
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:30,033
Hey gang, watch this.

213
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:33,613
Welcome to the bait shop,
how can I help you?

214
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,423
Yeah, hi.

215
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:40,281
We are here for so much fun,
It's a crime,

216
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:00,843
Woo-hoo.
Yeh!

217
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:04,351
We're at Villain-Con.
We're at Villain-Con!

218
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:07,144
LUV.2.ROB
NEW YORK

219
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:09,486
Alright, here we go.

220
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:14,003
Well, this is it. I want to tell you
and I really I mean this.

221
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:17,630
I'm really appreciate what you did
back there with the cops. Really.

222
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:20,399
Dad! It's Frankie Fishlips.

223
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:23,431
- I can smell him from here!
- Junior, get my camera.

224
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,544
Good luck in there, boys.

225
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:27,582
I hope you find what
you are looking for.

226
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,756
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

227
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:33,593
- And here comes Villain-Con!
- Ha ha.

228
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:37,252
- Yeah!
- Villain-Con.
- Ya-hoo.

229
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,925
Any evil talents?

230
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,422
Not bad.

231
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:54,718
What about you?
Any evil talents?

232
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:59,144
Hello. La la la.
La la la. Eh?

233
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:02,384
That's not evil,
or a talent.

234
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:13,229
Hello!
Laa! Ha ha.

235
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:14,302
No?

236
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:18,063
I'm sorry, but I'm not looking
for any more servants.

237
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:20,523
Because I, Professor
Flux,

238
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:24,304
have invented the 
world's first Time machine,

239
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:30,608
Every time I visit the future,
I bring my future self back to help me.

240
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,298
Hello.

241
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,020
Who's that over there,
Professor Flux from 2 weeks from now?

242
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:40,509
As you can see,
I don't need any help.

243
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:46,381
Oh. Way to go, guys.
We killed the original.

244
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:49,780
- Huh!
- Aw!

245
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,441
Shit.

246
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,283
<I> Villain-Con,
I present our keynote speaker. </I>

247
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:03,640
Scarlet Overkill.
The world's first female supervillain.

248
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:07,806
Appearing right now
in Hall 8.

249
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:17,433
Are you ready?

250
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:22,868
Go.
Scarlet Overkill.

251
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:25,502
Ha.

252
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:29,155
Doesn't it feel so good
to be bad?

253
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,956
- Scarlet. Scarlet.
- Hu-hu-hu.

254
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,685
Ha-ha-ha...

255
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:02,932
Wow.
Thank you.

256
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,702
Thank you so much.

257
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:10,085
Okay.
Shh shh shh.

258
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:19,218
When I started out, people said a woman
could never rob a bank as well as a man. Well.

259
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:22,806
Time's changed.

260
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:24,506
I love you, Scarlet!

261
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:29,633
Look at all those faces out there,
we are all so different.

262
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:31,949
But we have
one thing in common.

263
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:35,541
We were born with flippers.

264
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,100
No?
Just me?

265
00:28:39,397 --> 00:28:40,506
Okay.

266
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:46,628
We have big dreams, and we will
do anything to make them come true.

267
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:54,181
Have any of you ever dreamt of working
for the greatest supervillain of all time?

268
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,721
Heh-heh-heh.
Well.

269
00:28:58,746 --> 00:29:05,187
What if I were to tell you, that I
am looking for a new henchman!

270
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:15,429
I truly believe somewhere out there is a villain
with the potential to serve greatness.

271
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:19,189
- And it could be any of you.
- Whoa.

272
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,561
Although let's not kid ourselves.

273
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:26,973
Truly the man for this job
are Kevin and his Minions.

274
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,763
10 times the evil and
half the package.

275
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:31,630
I'm just in awe.

276
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:36,871
Let's hear it for Kevin.
He saved his tribe!

277
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,422
Kevin!
Kevin!

278
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:43,156
- Kevin Kevin Kev...
- Hey, Kevin. Hey.

279
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,415
Aw.

280
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,288
So.
How should we do this?

281
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:51,913
Hmm.
Oh.

282
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:54,364
You see this tiny little trinket?

283
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:56,925
Well, just take it from my hand
and you got the job.

284
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,914
No big deal,
it's almost too simple.

285
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,370
Eh heh heh.

286
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:05,221
Oh, come on, don't be afraid.
Just take the stone and get that job.

287
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:07,746
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

288
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:12,239
- That job is my.
- Uhf.

289
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,480
Now, go easy on me.

290
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,535
Heh-heh-heh-

291
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:23,908
Aw!

292
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,532
Love the costume.

293
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,023
Ha!

294
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,827
So cool!

295
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:48,668
Is no one good enough?

296
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,565
Bob!

297
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:55,290
Hi ya!

298
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,150
Awk.

299
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:14,999
Didn't my speech inspired anyone

300
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:18,293
to rise up and prove
themselves worthy?

301
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:22,226
All these villains, and yet
I still have the- bear.

302
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:24,352
Stuffed bear.
Why am I holding a bear?

303
00:31:24,377 --> 00:31:27,312
- Oh.
- Who has the ruby?

304
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:36,960
Wow.
Who-Who are you?

305
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:40,928
My... knights
in shiny denim.

306
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:43,945
- I'm Kevin. This is Stuart.
- Yo.
- And Bob.

307
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,161
- Minions!
- That was incredible.

308
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:51,245
Behold, the last creatures
you expect to win the day.

309
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,513
The emerged victorious.

310
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,332
Everyone,
meet my new henchmen.

311
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:58,384
The Minions!

312
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,827
- Kumbaya! Ha ha!
- Kumbaya!

313
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:04,477
Kumbaya!

314
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:08,871
Hey! I know those guys.
I gave them a ride here.

315
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:11,942
Woo.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

316
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:17,772
Buckle up, boys.
Next stop, England.

317
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:18,358
Hello.
Hey, Kevin.

318
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:21,682
Eh.
With Boss, in England.

319
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:39,444
Oh. Uh...hello Kevin.
Did-Did you say England.

320
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,018
Uh-huh.
The boss, yes.

321
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:43,824
Scarlet Overkill.
Ah.

322
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,080
Hello.
Hello?

323
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:56,873
Oh. He hung up.
Hello.

324
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,499
Wow.

325
00:34:16,194 --> 00:34:19,270
Here we go.
Come here.

326
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:22,691
By the way.
I really like your bear.

327
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:26,437
- Herb, my baby.
- You know I am.

328
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:29,336
How did it go?
Were you evil?

329
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,238
- So evil.
- Oh!

330
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:34,615
A little bird dropped
this off today.

331
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,551
I Missed You!
â™¥ H.

332
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,985
It's me,
I'm the "H".

333
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,279
Also, there's no birds.
Also me.

334
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:44,716
Herb, seriously.

335
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:46,791
I want to dig up that
William Shakespeare,

336
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:49,433
so he can see
what true writing is.

337
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,928
I love it.

338
00:34:50,968 --> 00:34:53,764
That works because I love you.

339
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:57,197
Well, I love you too.

340
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:04,109
Boys.
Could you come here please?

341
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:11,172
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

342
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:13,445
Herb, these are the new recruits.

343
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,666
Kevin, Stuart and
that cute little one is Bob.

344
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:24,839
Right on. You guys are crazy little and
way yellow, and I digged that.

345
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,205
Sweet, man.

346
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:36,152
- Wow.
- Cool house.

347
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,095
I know, right?

348
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,264
Just a few thing I stole
to help fill the void.

349
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,885
Checking out my can?

350
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,289
We stole that because finally

351
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:52,961
someone expressed my love
of soup in painting form.

352
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,578
- Wow.
- Woo.

353
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:59,082
Okay, listen up.
It is time to get down to business.

354
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:01,431
Do you know who this is?

355
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:03,312
Uh.
La cockroach?

356
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:07,924
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

357
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,939
I love England.
Their music, the fashion.

358
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:15,294
I'm seriously thinking about
overthrowing it someday.

359
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:20,500
Anyway. This pale drinking water
oversees it all.

360
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:23,468
I'm her biggest fan,
loved her work.

361
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:27,090
And I really really really
want her crown.

362
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:33,651
Stealing the crown and
all your dreams come true.

363
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,152
Respect!

364
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,225
Power!

365
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,060
Banana!

366
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:40,190
Banana!

367
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:52,131
Huh, Henry!

368
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,775


369
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,524
No.
Oh oh, no.

370
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:37,092
Don't get too close, boys.

371
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,701
When it's completed, it will
be my ultimate weapon. But.

372
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:44,296
Right now, it's leaking radiation.
Like you would not believe.

373
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,264
So you're here for gear.

374
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:55,715
- Bob, Robert, Bobby my boy.
- Yes?

375
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,939
You get my far out
stretch suit.

376
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:04,915
Kevin, Kevo, Seventh Kevin.

377
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,601
You are the proud owner 
of my Lava Lamp gun.

378
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:12,197
This baby shoots actual lava.

379
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:14,551
Pretty cool, right?

380
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:19,824
And finally, Stu, Stu-art,
Stuperman, Pitstu.

381
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:23,214
I got you the coolest invention,
probably ever.

382
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:26,604
Hypno hat!

383
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:35,307
You can use it
to hypnotize anyone.

384
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:36,667
Anyone!

385
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,492
Oh, you look so great.

386
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,474
I feel like a proud mama
with 3 dashing evil sons.

387
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:46,128
Uh. Scarlet. Scarlet.

388
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:49,455
No, no, don't say anything,
I wouldn't understand.

389
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:54,159
It's getting late, you had a big day.
You must be exhausted.

390
00:38:57,732 --> 00:38:59,987
Wow.
He can sure bounce.

391
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:05,011
Well, maybe I'll settle them down
with a bedtime story.

392
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:10,666
How does that sound, Bob?

393
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:13,090
Bob? Bob?
Bob!

394
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:14,550
Oh.
Bedtime story?

395
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,240
That, is a groovy idea,

396
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:21,744
I'll go get some cookies and warm milk.
This is going to be so fun!

397
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:23,343
And the bedtime story.

398
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:28,165
Oh, yes, I've got a really really
good bedtime borey.

399
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,231
Once upon a time
there were 3 little pigs.

400
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:39,795
One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big bad wolf,

401
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:43,486
who had a wonderful
surprise for them,

402
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:48,470
The wolf offered the 3 piggies and
all their friends a job working for her.

403
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:51,720
Everyone would be so happy.

404
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:55,818
All the 3 little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown.

405
00:39:55,843 --> 00:40:01,465
That the beautiful wolf had wanted ever since
she was a penniless little street cub.

406
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,263
Unloved and abandoned.

407
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:08,850
But that crown would mean
she was a princess.

408
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:11,074
And everybody loves the princess.

409
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,198
So, the wolf sent the
piggies to get that crown.

410
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:18,386
But the little piggies weren't
up to the challenge.

411
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:20,665
They failed their mission.

412
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:23,783
So the wolf huffed and puffed

413
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,535
and she blew them off
 the face of the earth.

414
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,493
The End.

415
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,947
Good luck getting the crown
tomorrow, little piggies.

416
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:45,701
I know you won't disappoint me.

417
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:55,483
Tower of London

418
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:56,609
Tower of London - LONDON

419
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,894
Hello.
3 please.

420
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,878
You are not allowed
to enter without an adult.

421
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:19,128
Scram, hooligans.

422
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:38,769
How many tickets, please?

423
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:41,407
3, please.

424
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:44,571
1 please.
1.

425
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:53,402
- Enjoy yourself, love.
- Thank you.

426
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:22,266
Hey!
What are you doing here?

427
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:25,865
This is a restricted area!

428
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,889
Hands in the air!

429
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:30,111
Let me do it.

430
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,224
Stop that!

431
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,358
Get back!

432
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:59,210
So.

433
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:03,041
You came for the
queen's crown, did you?

434
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:06,203
Well, you're gonna
have to get through me.

435
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,427
The keeper!
Of the crown.

436
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:18,892
You think it's funny
to mock the elderly, do ya?

437
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,063
I've been up here
for decades.

438
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:27,658
Just waiting for someone to try
and steal the queen's treasure.

439
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,353
Okay.
Me will do it.

440
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:34,950
What are you saying?
And I don't care!

441
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:37,079
Hee hee.
Ha ha ha.

442
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,900
Oh no, you don't.

443
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:45,905
Get out of the way.

444
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,296
Hello.

445
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:51,200
Hello.

446
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:52,781
- Stop the bloke!
- Stop him, men!

447
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:55,229
- To the legs.
- Freeze.

448
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,937
Aw.
Manic.

449
00:46:00,962 --> 00:46:03,095
Kevin!

450
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,448
The Queen's been kidnapped, Sgt.

451
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:12,073
Blimey!

452
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:38,964
- What's going on?
- Hello.

453
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:49,842
Gentlemen do not steal
 ladies' crowns!

454
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:08,716
Oh, no no no...

455
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:14,273
Oh-Oh dear!

456
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:31,045
You scoundrel.
After them!

457
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:34,602
Stop the blighter!

458
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:36,883
- Stop the blighter!
[SWORD IN THE STONE]

459
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:39,676
You're surrounded.

460
00:47:55,575 --> 00:47:57,801
Oh, blimey!

461
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,845
One of England's most famous myths
has become a reality.

462
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:04,343
As a new king
has been crowned.

463
00:48:04,368 --> 00:48:07,461
Bob, who appears to be
a bald jaundice child

464
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:09,968
Has pulled the famed sword
right from it's stone

465
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:13,774
which legend dictates,
makes him the new king,

466
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,678
Tiny yellow traitor!

467
00:48:29,918 --> 00:48:32,683
Ah-ha-ha.
England!

468
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:36,192
England!
England!

469
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,364
England.

470
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,939
- England.
- England.

471
00:48:42,158 --> 00:48:43,905
- England.
- England.

472
00:49:31,021 --> 00:49:33,090
Hello, King Bob.

473
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:35,654
Welcome to Buckingham Palace.

474
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:37,499
Uh.
No.

475
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:39,625
Oh.
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

476
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,733
Whatever is bothering you,
we can make it right.

477
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:44,702
- Just name it.
- Oh.

478
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:13,711
King Bob!

479
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:15,918
- Yeh!
- Hurrah!

480
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:17,947
- King Bob!
- Yeh.

481
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:56,540
King Bob!

482
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,132
Whoa, wait.

483
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:21,884
- Yee-ha!
- King Bob.

484
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:40,729
Yes, King Bob.

485
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:44,666
King Bob?

486
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:47,030
King Bob?

487
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:00,467
Ball...

488
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:03,237
How dare you.
Aw!

489
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:10,758
Scarlet.

490
00:52:10,783 --> 00:52:14,480
Don't you Scarlet me.
You backstabbing little traitors!

491
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:18,106
Using Herb's inventions
to steal my crown!

492
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:22,015
I feel used
not going to lie.

493
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,726
You stole my dream.

494
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:27,842
I was going to conquer
England some day.

495
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:29,851
There was going
to be a coronation.

496
00:52:29,876 --> 00:52:32,482
And I was going
to be made queen,

497
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:34,434
Every moment was planned.

498
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:37,793
I would wear a dress
so sparkly and glowed.

499
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:40,923
And everyone whoever doubted me

500
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:45,144
Would be watching
and they would be crying.

501
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:48,603
I was going to be the picture
of elegance and class!

502
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:51,527
And you pinheads
screwed it up!

503
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:54,053
No no no.
The crown, for you.

504
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,149
No, no no.
King Bob.

505
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,939
You cannot just abdicate the throne.

506
00:52:58,964 --> 00:53:00,794
Who invited the square?

507
00:53:00,819 --> 00:53:04,443
And you definitely cannot just
give the job to this woman.

508
00:53:04,468 --> 00:53:06,172
There are laws.

509
00:53:06,197 --> 00:53:07,497
Laws?

510
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:17,388
Bob King has official changed the law.

511
00:53:17,413 --> 00:53:21,156
Clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill
to be crowned Queen of England,

512
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:24,505
She will be coronated at London's
historic Westminster Abbey.

513
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,926
If I'm wasn't so polite,

514
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:28,536
I say this spells certain
doom for the country,

515
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:30,013
If not, the world.

516
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:33,790
But, I'm so very polite,
that I shall keep my mouth shut.

517
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:36,720
But, seriously,
we are all in big trouble.

518
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:42,739
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

519
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:46,061
I'm just above and
beyond the call of duty.

520
00:53:46,086 --> 00:53:51,855
You are 3 tiny golden
pill shaped miracle workers.

521
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,296
And you have stolen not just England,
but my heart.

522
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,766
- Scarlet, over here.
- Over here.

523
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,888
Pardon Me?

524
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:07,042
Wow, so many.

525
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:08,730
Good for you,

526
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,354
Well.
You all get what you deserved.

527
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:45,882
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

528
00:54:49,197 --> 00:54:50,725
Problem.

529
00:54:56,081 --> 00:54:58,250
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way.

530
00:54:58,275 --> 00:54:59,605
But I hate you.

531
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,846
I thought I could
get over what you did.

532
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:04,945
But I feel so betrayed.

533
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:09,168
I think, yes, I think
we're gonna have to break up.

534
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:11,508
And it's not you.

535
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:12,970
Oh wait, hold on.

536
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,517
It is you.
It's a 100% you.

537
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:17,047
Huh.
No no.

538
00:55:17,072 --> 00:55:21,405
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real real comfortable.

539
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:29,077
Because this is where you're going to spend
the rest of your worthless little lives.

540
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:34,326
Alright, let's do this.

541
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:39,837
Who's this handsome Herb fellow?
No, My name is Blerb.

542
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:41,622
I'm a-a dungeon master.

543
00:55:41,647 --> 00:55:44,887
Prepared for torture, which I do.

544
00:55:45,785 --> 00:55:47,546
Alright, are we comfy?

545
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:51,482
Doesn't matter.
This is torture.

546
00:55:57,073 --> 00:56:00,542
Wow, harder than I thought.
Next machine.

547
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:06,249
Oh, welcome to hang town.
Population, you.

548
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:15,219
Cut it that.
This is really unprofessional.

549
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:16,692
No laughing in the dungeon,

550
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:19,258
I want to see tears and
I want to hear screams.

551
00:56:19,283 --> 00:56:20,966
Or I'm gonna get..

552
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,228
- Wait.
- Hey.

553
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,329
Eww, I've got a groovy idea.

554
00:56:26,896 --> 00:56:29,825
Look at this.
Ah-ha-ha.

555
00:56:35,107 --> 00:56:38,391
Hello, the future King Herb Overkill.

556
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:40,759
Please come upstairs to
prepare for the coronation.

557
00:56:40,784 --> 00:56:43,972
Well, I hope you learn 
your lesson for today.

558
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:50,402
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time.

559
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:54,477
I don't even know 
anyone named Blerb.

560
00:56:58,004 --> 00:57:03,231
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England.

561
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:05,038
I know, it's a gas.

562
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:07,273
- I will finally get my crown.
- Yeah.

563
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:08,725
It's all I ever wanted.

564
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:11,892
I'm going to be so happy.

565
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:15,000
But, let me ask you
something, Fabrice.

566
00:57:15,025 --> 00:57:19,188
Does that,
look like this to you?

567
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:26,114
Mrs. Overkill, the hair in the picture
is just 2 wavy lines.

568
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:29,046
So. So what now,
you're an art critic?

569
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,957
I drew that when
I was 5 years old.

570
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:34,079
Get out of my sight.

571
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,147
Bye, Fabrice.

572
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,906
I liked him,
he was fun.

573
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:43,569
So, what do you think
of the dress?

574
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,695
Oh, it's so beautiful,

575
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,250
so fashion forward,
so Valentino.

576
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:52,864
Got the sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.

577
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:57,035
The high colored and cinch waist reflect
a simpler more valentine.

578
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,827
The material is a blend of taffeta

579
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:00,639
and high density body armor.

580
00:58:00,664 --> 00:58:02,868
Fully armed and loaded.

581
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:06,071
And they glow.
That's nuclear.

582
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:08,761
Nice.
Just one more thing to do.

583
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,039
Got to look good
for the public.

584
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:14,610
- Do you mind?
- My pleasure.

585
00:58:15,678 --> 00:58:18,766
A little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

586
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,715
A little tighter.

587
00:58:20,948 --> 00:58:22,427
Tighter.

588
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,368
Must have tighter waist.

589
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:28,843
Seems to work.
Seems to work.

590
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:30,228
Losing feeling in my legs.

591
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,702
Perfect.
Tight, tight tight tight.

592
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,760
Bob, Stuart.

593
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,418
- Huh?
- Help me.

594
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:43,026
Lift up.
Lift up.

595
00:58:43,183 --> 00:58:45,046
Lift up.
Lift up.

596
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:48,515
Help me.
Help me!

597
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:23,236
<font color="#ffce9d">SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS</font>

598
00:59:23,261 --> 00:59:27,433
<font color="#ffaed7">SORRY SCARLET</font>

599
00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:58,262
I love you, Scarlet!

600
00:59:58,287 --> 01:00:02,638
Queen wave. Queen wave.
Queen waving.

601
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:15,866
I'm so so excited.  This is perfect.
Everyone looks so nice.

602
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:20,095
Oh, you're just adorable.

603
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:22,509
Oh.
Yes!

604
01:00:22,534 --> 01:00:24,750
And that music.

605
01:00:24,775 --> 01:00:27,687
Who is that organist?
She's good.

606
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:29,693
Right?
She looks like an Edna.

607
01:00:29,718 --> 01:00:33,088
- Edna! You're very good.
- Who's that?

608
01:00:36,151 --> 01:00:39,222
Thanks for doing this, Padre.
Big fan.

609
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:43,389
Come here, let me squeeze you.
You're so squishy.

610
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:51,951
Will you to your power cause Law
and Justice, in Mercy,

611
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,523
Do you Scarlet Overkill...

612
01:02:56,975 --> 01:03:03,926
I proclaim thee, Scarlet Overkill,
the Queen of England.

613
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:08,143
Kevin.

614
01:03:15,036 --> 01:03:17,944
Scarlet. Scarlet.
My queen.

615
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:20,392
Somebody help me!

616
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:24,299
Come on, come on.
Lift on 2.

617
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:26,905
1, 2...

618
01:03:39,224 --> 01:03:44,618
- Scarlet, you're okay.
- He tried to kill me!

619
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,672
Guys. This is no
longer a coronation.

620
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:51,369
It is an execution!

621
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,538
Get them!

622
01:03:57,492 --> 01:04:01,406
Whoa Nelly!
Run fellows, run!

623
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:48,065
You are mine.

624
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,536
Hey.
I've got one.

625
01:05:58,045 --> 01:06:00,444
Mind the gap.

626
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,074
Mind the gap.

627
01:06:07,216 --> 01:06:09,018
Mind the gap.

628
01:06:09,043 --> 01:06:11,099
Mind the gap.

629
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:23,760
Now, what about this one.

630
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:26,910
Why did the Queen
go to the dentist?

631
01:06:26,935 --> 01:06:30,848
To get her teeth crowned.
Ha-ha-ha.

632
01:06:31,618 --> 01:06:34,499
Tell us another one, Lizzie.

633
01:06:36,017 --> 01:06:38,054
Oh, it's you,

634
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:43,260
Everyone, this is one of the little fellows
who stole the monarchy from me.

635
01:06:43,285 --> 01:06:46,606
And hows that
working out for you?

636
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,826
Oh, yes yes.
I saw what was going on, on the telly.

637
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:57,655
What was meant to be the coronation of 
Scarlet Overkill has gone terribly wrong.

638
01:06:59,659 --> 01:07:03,227
Kevin. Kevin.
I know you're out there.

639
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:08,469
You think you'd gotten away, 
well, what do we have here?

640
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,289
Bob?
Stuart?

641
01:07:10,314 --> 01:07:12,734
Which one shall I kill first?

642
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:18,617
Little Bob. Stuart. 
Bob. Stuart. Hmm.

643
01:07:18,642 --> 01:07:24,016
I will do it, Kevin,
if you're not back here by dawn.

644
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,812
Oh my.

645
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,490
There he is.

646
01:07:55,646 --> 01:07:57,732
Follow me.

647
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:12,832
Harder. 
It's just my head.

648
01:08:15,203 --> 01:08:18,866
This way. Go get him.
Go-go-go...

649
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,947
<font color="#ff9797">[DO NOT PRESS THE BUTTON â‡’]</font>

650

653
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,204
Activation in

654
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:51,254
3.

655
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,206
2.

656
01:08:52,231 --> 01:08:53,696
1.

657
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:24,213
Hello.

658
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:34,985
This is it, boys.

659
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,339
Things do not look good for you.

660
01:09:37,364 --> 01:09:39,888
Oh. 
And I'm keeping the bear.

661
01:09:40,713 --> 01:09:43,051
You're not going to need it
in where you're going.

662
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:44,863
Heaven.

663
01:09:59,605 --> 01:10:03,582
Bye bye. Say bye bye, Bob.
Bye bye.

664
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:45,425
Wait, what?
How did he?

665
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:47,120
Hold my bear.

666
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:17,509
So, that's your plan?

667
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:21,941
Make yourself a bigger target?
Ha-ha-ha.

668
01:11:34,058 --> 01:11:37,029
YAH!

669
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,861
Ha ha ha ha.

670
01:11:55,447 --> 01:11:56,848
And so help me.

671
01:11:56,873 --> 01:12:00,795
I never want to see another one 
of your goofy buttered faces ever again!

672
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,037
Scarlet!
Scarlet!

673
01:12:02,062 --> 01:12:03,254
What?

674
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:04,696
Scarlet!
Scarlet!

675
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:07,611
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

676
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:13,458
Oh no, you don't.
Ha!

677
01:12:19,408 --> 01:12:22,236
And just for the record,
my little double eggs.

678
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:26,741
You can thank Kevin for
what I'm about to do to you!

679
01:12:26,766 --> 01:12:29,711
Aw! Ou!
Ou.

680
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:38,917
Tony!
Hey hey.

681
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:41,399
Tom!
And Chris!

682
01:12:58,118 --> 01:12:59,967
Eww.

683
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:04,627
Enough!

684
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:09,815
This... ends... now...!

685
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:40,477
Ha-ha-ha, you imbecile.
Have fun exploding.

686
01:13:40,502 --> 01:13:42,426
Take me
home...

687
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:45,444
- What's the rush? 
- Got to get out of here.

688
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:49,753
Let... us... go!

689
01:13:52,518 --> 01:13:55,552
Whoa!

690
01:13:56,563 --> 01:13:59,476
No, no no no...

691
01:14:07,827 --> 01:14:10,918
KEVIN!

692
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,248
Look!

693
01:15:22,404 --> 01:15:24,128
Ouch.

694
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,225
Ladies and gentlemen.

695
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:04,936
We are here today
to celebrate the Minions.

696
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:13,601
The country owes you a 
great debt of gratitude.

697
01:16:13,794 --> 01:16:19,485
Bob, you were a wise and 
noble king for all of 8 hours.

698
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:22,965
So for you, 
I offer this tiny crown

699
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:25,797
for your Teddy Bear, Tim.

700
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,850
Thank you.
Thank you.

701
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,636
Oh.
Very good, Bob.

702
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:34,431
Oh... 
Oh, spectacular!

703
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,867
I'm so proud of you boys.

704
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:40,388
- Oh, Stuart.
- Ah.

705
01:16:40,509 --> 01:16:46,881
For you, I have this beautiful, 
super duper incredible

706
01:16:46,906 --> 01:16:48,879
snow globe.

707
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:52,381
And, look look.

708
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:54,798
Hours of excitement.

709
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:59,465
Oh, ah. Yippee.
Thank you.

710
01:17:01,494 --> 01:17:05,524
Oh, Stuart. 
We're just messing with you.

711
01:17:05,549 --> 01:17:09,388
Don't be mad at me.
It's was â€‹Kevin's idea.

712
01:17:10,848 --> 01:17:13,849
We have a much 
better surprise for you.

713
01:17:13,874 --> 01:17:16,280
Here. 
A Super Mega Ukulele.

714
01:17:16,305 --> 01:17:19,175
Wo-Wow.
Cool.

715
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,333
Thank you.

716
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:57,087
Right.

717
01:17:57,607 --> 01:18:00,366
And finally, Kevin.

718
01:18:02,537 --> 01:18:06,146
You are hero of the
highest order.

719
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:11,122
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

720
01:18:11,147 --> 01:18:15,070
From here on out, 
you are Sir Kevin.

721
01:18:15,406 --> 01:18:17,235
Well done.

722
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:29,134
What a beautiful moment.

723
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:31,246
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!

724
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:36,629
The nation and the world was
celebrating Kevin, Stuart, and Bob,

725
01:18:36,654 --> 01:18:38,841
that last few thousand years 
weren't enough.

726
01:18:38,866 --> 01:18:44,083
No question but things were 
finally going their way.

727
01:18:44,108 --> 01:18:47,699
Kevin had never been more proud.

728
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:49,726
But something was missing.

729
01:18:49,751 --> 01:18:53,219
Ha ha, yes. Good show
Good show.

730
01:18:54,051 --> 01:18:57,160
My crown is gone.
It's gone!

731
01:18:57,185 --> 01:18:59,987
- Blimey!
- She lost the crown.

732
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,602
Ha-ha-ha...

733
01:19:11,472 --> 01:19:13,080
They took everything from me.

734
01:19:13,105 --> 01:19:15,552
My castle. 
My reputation.

735
01:19:15,577 --> 01:19:18,250
Things looked bleak, baby,
I'm not gonna lie.

736
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:22,774
But now, at least,
I have my crown!

737
01:19:36,387 --> 01:19:39,186
Fellow, give me that back.

738
01:19:39,211 --> 01:19:42,372
No, I don't think so.

739
01:19:42,397 --> 01:19:45,758
You have no idea 
who you are messing with.

740
01:19:45,783 --> 01:19:49,325
I'm the greatest 
supervillain of all time.

741
01:19:49,775 --> 01:19:52,350
Oh, were you?

742
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:29,918
Are you really going to allow that 
little penguin to make off with my crown?

743
01:20:30,718 --> 01:20:35,282
Oh, Herb.
I'm done.

744
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,930
For Me?
Oh.

745
01:20:41,955 --> 01:20:45,701
Yes, for you.
Bye bye.

746
01:20:45,726 --> 01:20:47,863
Big boss!

747
01:20:49,389 --> 01:20:53,898
And that is how the Minions 
found their new boss.

748
01:20:53,923 --> 01:20:55,933
He was cunning.
He was evil.

749
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:57,508
He was perfect.

750
01:20:57,533 --> 01:20:59,492
He was...

751
01:20:59,517 --> 01:21:02,313
despicable.

752
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:10,468
