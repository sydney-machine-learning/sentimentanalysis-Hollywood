1
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,918
How's that going?

2
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,887
The mother's bawling
and the uncle's pissed off.

3
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,124
- She's not married?
- Divorced with four kids.

4
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,293
I guess father was helping out.

5
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,195
Helping out?

6
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,899
Hey, Mr. Burke,
they're in back talking to the bishop.

7
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,635
- And father?
- We put him in the break room.

8
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:47,306
Any press? Some guy from the<i> Citizen,</i>
but we sent him away.

9
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,975
None of the big papers.
Let's keep it that way.

10
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,079
- Who's that?
- Assistant DA.

11
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,548
It's gonna be hard to keep the papers
away from the arraignment.

12
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,684
What arraignment?

13
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,623
You can tell father Geoghan
I won't be much longer.

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,892
Now, Sheila, you know

15
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:10,996
what good work the church does
in the community.

16
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,332
I give you
my personal guarantee

17
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,734
that I'm going to take father
out of the parish

18
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,504
and this will never
happen again.

19
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,176
- We'll just be another moment, Paul.
- Of course, father.

20
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,813
Now, Sheila,
I'm going to give you my personal card.

21
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,221
Losing a good reporter
is always tough.

22
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,190
But losing one of our best...

23
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:15,794
uh, well, to put it as eloquently as I can,
it's a real kick in the ass.

24
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,632
But Robby here has known Stewart longer
than most of you have been alive,

25
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,234
so I'll hand it off to him.

26
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,304
Robby.
Oh, well, thanks, Ben.

27
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,872
I think.

28
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:31,843
Although I take issue
with your reference to my seniority,

29
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:36,081
I will say that Stewart's departure
is especially painful for me.

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,817
Because for...
what, Stewart?

31
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,485
Twenty years now?

32
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,089
Stewart's been more than willing
to part with his money at the poker table.

33
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,026
And I've got a kid
in college.

34
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,796
Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing.
Oh, problem solved.

35
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,399
Godspeed then.

36
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,669
Now, Stewart,
I find the timing

37
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,639
of your departure
disconcerting.

38
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,276
The corner office
sits empty.

39
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,445
The new editor
arrives on Monday.

40
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:10,249
So I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta ask ya,

41
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,251
what the hell
do you know?

42
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,136
How's the cake?

43
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,638
It's really good.

44
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,773
Are you saving yours?
Nah, it's for Mike.

45
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,776
I can never eat at those things.
They kind of depress me. I know.

46
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,779
Did you see the numbers from Washington?
Yeah. Very interesting.

47
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,147
I think so too.

48
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,650
I'm not asking if the PD's lying.
I know they're lying.

49
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,085
All I'm asking...
who's behind it?

50
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,855
Uh-huh. Okay, I get it.
You don't want to talk.

51
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,758
No, Dan.
I'm not mad, I'm hungry.

52
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,627
I've been talking so long I didn't eat lunch.
So I'm going to get something to eat.

53
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,664
That'll give you an hour to decide whether
you want to be on the right side of this

54
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,565
or read about it
like everybody else.

55
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,402
- Bye, Dan.
- You think Cahill has something?

56
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,604
Maybe. I just don't think
the story's for us.

57
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,673
Ben likes it.
Yeah, it's not bad.

58
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:10,008
It's just not Spotlight.
What's just not Spotlight?

59
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,611
The PD numbers.
The numbers story. It feels thin.

60
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,980
Oh. You got Cahill to talk?

61
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,517
No. But I will.

62
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,886
Good. Then we'll know
if it's thin.

63
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,356
How'd it go upstairs?
Okay.

64
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,858
Robby gave a good speech.
I'm sure he did.

65
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,362
- I heard Lubin and Connor are going to the<i> Times.</i>
- Come on. Really?

66
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,997
They're leeching us.

67
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,633
They're sending a guy from Miami
to run things. That should help.

68
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,302
Has Baron
even spent time in Boston?

69
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,871
I don't think he's been here before.
We should buy him a map.

70
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,874
A friend down in Miami
said he cut 15% of the staff. Great.

71
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,310
Hey, Robby.
New boss coming in to make some cuts?

72
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,145
I have no idea.

73
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,182
- Aren't you sitting down with him?
- Yes, I am.

74
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,551
So is it about Spotlight?
I don't know, Mike.

75
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:57,022
But I do know that Ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story.

76
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,525
I'm telling you,
I really don't think that story's for us.

77
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,632
Mr. Baron.
Oh.

78
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,202
Walter Robinson.
Robby. Yeah.

79
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,671
Thanks for taking the time out
of your weekend. My pleasure.

80
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,740
Appreciate it.
Pleasure.

81
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:18,577
What are you reading?
Uh,<i> Curse Of The Bambino.</i>

82
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,246
Ah, yeah.
It's a great book.

83
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,983
The<i> Globe</i> has season tickets at Fenway
once you're settled in, by the way.

84
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,421
Thank you. To be honest, I'm...
I'm not much of a baseball fan.

85
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:32,190
I'm just trying to get
a feel for the city.

86
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,493
Oh. Yeah.

87
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,495
So you're originally
from Boston?

88
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,497
I am.
Born and raised, yeah.

89
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,766
A lot of the newsroom
is from here.

90
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,069
It really feels like a...
like a local paper in that way.

91
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,672
And did that change at all
after the paper was sold to the<i> Times?</i>

92
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,210
No. No, I don't think
that had a big impact.

93
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,912
Good.

94
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,017
And, uh, you're an editor
for the Spotlight team?

95
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,587
I'd prefer to think of myself
as player coach, but yes.

96
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,623
Are you familiar
with Spotlight?

97
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,224
No, not particularly.

98
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:09,961
Well, we are a four-person
investigative team.

99
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,531
We report
to Ben Bradlee Jr.,

100
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,699
and we keep
our work confidential.

101
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,969
What are you working on now?

102
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,306
We just put out a piece
on a shoddy construction outfit,

103
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,811
and right now we're really just trolling
around for our next story.

104
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,313
How long does that
typically take?

105
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,682
Hard to say.
Uh, a couple months.

106
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,318
- Couple months?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,220
We don't like to rush it.

108
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:40,692
Once we settle on a project,
we can spend a year or more investigating it.

109
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,931
Is that a concern?
Not necessarily.

110
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,333
Um, but from what I understand,
readership is down.

111
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,270
Internet is cutting into
the classified business and, uh,

112
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,574
I think I'm gonna need to
take a hard look at things.

113
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,612
So, you anticipate
more cuts.

114
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,482
Uh, I think
it's safe to assume so.

115
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:08,253
But, uh, what I'm more
focused on right now is finding a way to...

116
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,990
to make this paper
essential to its readers.

117
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,193
I like to think
it already is.

118
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,599
Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.

119
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,045
Mr. Bradlee.
Hey.

120
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,881
Saw the PD numbers.
Looks interesting.

121
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,682
Yeah, there's
something there.

122
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,719
How long do you need?
Uh, another week.

123
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,221
Where are you going?
To the 10:30.

124
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,723
Since when?

125
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,125
Well, technically,
I am an editor.

126
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,829
Technically.
Your sit-down with Baron go that well?

127
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,832
I couldn't get a read on him.
That's a first.

128
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,334
How about you?
Well, he's a barrel of laughs.

129
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,072
- Morning, everyone.
- Let's get started.

130
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,475
Do you want to
say something, Marty?

131
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,011
Uh, sure.

132
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,812
Uh, hello.

133
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,715
Uh, as most of you
know by now,

134
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,084
my name is Marty Baron.

135
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,488
I'm, uh,
delighted to be here.

136
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,593
Um, if you could tell me your name as we
go around, that'd be helpful.

137
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,228
Thank you.

138
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,598
Okay. Peter?

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,767
Peter Canellos, Metro.

140
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,069
I've got a major
big dig closure.

141
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,006
Hey, Steve.
Mike.

142
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,109
Hey. Crappy game
last night, huh?

143
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,178
Yeah, they can't hit
worth a nickel.

144
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,848
Hey, listen, what's, um...
what's Eileen McNamara doing in the 10:30?

145
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,352
Do you need something, Mike?
No, just curious.

146
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,621
Go be curious somewhere else.
I got work to do.

147
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,257
Okay, Steve. See ya.
Yeah.

148
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,460
And it looks like Pedro's
gonna be out till September 1.

149
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,296
Jimmy says he'll be back this year,
but the Doc didn't seem so sure.

150
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,832
When's the Pats opener?

151
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,137
Is that, uh, everyone?

152
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,541
- Yes, that's it.
- Okay. Good. Thank you.

153
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:14,746
Uh, did everyone read
Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?

154
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,615
That's the Geoghan case?

155
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,650
Yeah.
What's the folo on that?

156
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:23,421
It... it's a column.
What kind of folo were you thinking?

157
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,424
Uh, well, apparently
this Priest molested kids

158
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,760
in six different parishes
over the last 30 years,

159
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,929
and the attorney
for the victims, Mr., uh...

160
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,465
- Garabedian.
- Thanks, Eileen.

161
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,402
Mr. Garabedian says Cardinal law found
out about it 15 years ago and did nothing.

162
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,338
I think that attorney's a bit of a crank.
And the church dismissed the claim.

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,806
He said, she said.

164
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,175
Whether Mr. Garabedian
is a crank or not,

165
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,511
he says he has documents
that prove the Cardinal knew.

166
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,147
As I understand it,
those documents are under seal.

167
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,084
Okay, but the fact remains,
a Boston Priest abused 80 kids,

168
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,787
we have a lawyer who says
he can prove law knew about it,

169
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,158
and we've written all of, uh,
two stories in the last six months.

170
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,528
This strikes me as an essential story
to a local paper.

171
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,132
I think at the very least
we have to go through those documents.

172
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,001
How would you
like to do that?

173
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,704
Well, uh, I don't know
what the laws are here,

174
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,106
but in Florida,
we would go to court.

175
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,908
You want to sue the church?

176
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,544
Technically,
we wouldn't sue the church.

177
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,380
We'd file a motion
to lift the seal on those documents.

178
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,816
The church will read that
as us suing them.

179
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,851
So will everybody else.

180
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,354
Good to know.

181
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,026
Gutsy call for the first day.
That's one word for it.

182
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,895
How do you think
that's gonna play down front?

183
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,297
I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.

184
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,799
- Hey.
- Door.

185
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,467
How'd it go?

186
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:46,371
Well, Baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the Geoghan case.

187
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,340
He wants to sue the church?
Hey, that's great. Yeah.

188
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,377
We covered Geoghan
when the story broke three years ago.

189
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,079
Baron was still in Miami.

190
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:57,248
He might have been at the<i> Times</i>
then, actually. He wasn't here.

191
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,151
So do you think that suit
has a chance?

192
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,154
- Depends on the judge.
- And what parish he belongs to.

193
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,560
Bradlee. Yeah.

194
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,961
Okay.

195
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,899
- Baron wants to talk to us.
- Us?

196
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,602
- Okay, Joe.
- Thank you.

197
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,004
Yes.
Okay, thanks.

198
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,776
I've set up a meeting for tomorrow
with outside counsel.

199
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,678
Joe Albano?
Yeah.

200
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,580
Who's the judge
in this case?

201
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,749
Um...

202
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,584
Constance Sweeney.

203
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,185
- Tough.
- Why's that?

204
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:37,489
Good catholic girl.
Huh.

205
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,693
So, um, judging from
what I've read,

206
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:45,764
it doesn't seem like we've done a very
thorough investigation into the Geoghan case.

207
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,199
- Is that right?
- No, it's not.

208
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,135
We looked hard at Geoghan.

209
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,304
David Armstrong from Metro,
Michael Paulson for religion.

210
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,307
Okay, but, uh,
just so I understand,

211
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,777
beyond our daily coverage,
we haven't...

212
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,813
we haven't committed any long-term
investigative resources

213
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,549
to the question of whether or not
Cardinal law knew about this.

214
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,418
No, we haven't.

215
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,654
And that's the kind of thing
your team would do?

216
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,422
Spotlight? Well, yeah.

217
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:15,193
But we're still prospecting
the Boston PD story I told you about.

218
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,063
- Could you set that aside?
- We could.

219
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,766
Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large part

220
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,402
because they pick
their own projects.

221
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,575
Would you consider
picking this one?

222
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,646
I don't know if he's writing about you,
but I will let him know you called.

223
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,115
Okay. Bye.
Hey.

224
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,951
Hey, how'd it go?
Okay.

225
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,922
Uh, Baron wants us
to scrub the Geoghan case.

226
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,525
- That's great.
- Didn't we cover Geoghan?

227
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,961
Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal law knew about it.

228
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,629
Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right?
Yeah.

229
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,199
I covered him at the courthouse.
Can you get to him?

230
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,668
I only interviewed him once.
He's kind of a character.

231
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,304
- I like characters. I'll take him.
- Good. You take him.

232
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:03,341
Also, we should be talking to the lawyer
who repped the victims in the Porter case.

233
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,878
- Eric Macleish.
That guy was always on TV.

234
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,947
The Porter case? Remind me.
Yeah, uh...

235
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,717
father Porter, similar story. Molested dozens
of kids in fall river about 10 years ago.

236
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,386
- So we're dropping the Boston PD?
- I-I vote yes.

237
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,555
No. We just gotta
set it aside for now.

238
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,893
I don't need to tell you guys this.
We need to be more discreet than usual.

239
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,796
Everybody's going to be interested in this,
not just the<i> Herald.</i>

240
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:28,833
We can't let Cardinal law get wind of this
till we know what we have.

241
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,435
Good luck with that.

242
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,542
So when do you leave, Nana?

243
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,678
The bus is picking us up
in the church parking lot at 9:00.

244
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,213
We have
40 people going.

245
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,750
And is father Dominic going?
No. He says he's unlucky.

246
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,652
But luck has nothing
to do with it.

247
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,455
You know, last time Nana won $160.
Wow.

248
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,360
You gonna tell her?

249
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,395
We don't even know
if there's a story yet.

250
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,498
<i>Globe</i> sues church?
It's gonna be a story.

251
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,720
Hey, Lisa. Could you pull
all the relevant clips on that for me?

252
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,255
Yeah.

253
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,090
Is this for Spotlight?

254
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,192
Just drop them off when they're ready.
Thanks.

255
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,264
Excuse me. Do you know where
the publisher's office is?

256
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,800
Will do.

257
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,638
How are you, Marty?

258
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,140
Settling in?

259
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,808
Yeah, I think so.

260
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,644
Good. What can I do for you?

261
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,813
Um...

262
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,383
I'd like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.

263
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,485
You want to sue
the catholic church?

264
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,154
Um...

265
00:15:56,156 --> 00:16:00,124
we're just filing a motion,
but, uh, yes.

266
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,393
You think it's that important?

267
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,329
Yes, I do.

268
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,633
Because obviously the church
will fight us very hard on this.

269
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,402
Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base.

270
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,404
53% of them are Catholic.

271
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,806
Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,842
I think they'll be interested.

273
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,547
Okay.

274
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:31,189
Marty, lake street will probably contact you
about a face-to-face with the Cardinal.

275
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,358
- It's customary.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,394
They already have.
It's set up for next week.

277
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,164
I wouldn't mention this.

278
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,776
Hello?

279
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,180
Hello?

280
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,217
Can I help you? Oh, hi. I'm Mike Rezendes
from the<i> Boston Globe.</i>

281
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,685
I'm here to see
Mitchell Garabedian.

282
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,554
He's on a call.
Please have a seat.

283
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,189
Okay.

284
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,860
All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.

285
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,830
Okay.

286
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,066
Bill! Where the hell
are those papers?

287
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,201
I asked you
to put 'em on my desk!

288
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:36,387
The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.

289
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,923
Good to see you again, Eric.
Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric Macleish.

290
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,226
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
You don't play golf, do you?

291
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,095
- Uh, no.
- Good.

292
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,998
Your colleague here took some money
off me at a charity event last year.

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,234
It was a very lucky putt.
I actually had my eyes closed, by the way.

294
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,903
Mm-hmm.

295
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,105
So how can I
help you guys?

296
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,241
Uh, you're familiar
with the Geoghan case?

297
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,343
Sure.
Eighty Plaintiffs.

298
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,412
All of them
individual cases.

299
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,281
Garabedian
must be swimming.

300
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:07,118
Yeah. And the allegations
against Cardinal law?

301
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,188
Yeah, it's tricky. Um...

302
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,458
this is what you need to understand.
These are shitty cases.

303
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,694
Um, the statute of limitations
is only three years,

304
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,730
and most of these victims don't come
forward till long after that.

305
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:23,134
- Oh. Why is that?
- Well, they're kids, you know.

306
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,869
Uh, guilt, shame.

307
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,804
And most of these kids
come from tough neighborhoods.

308
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,973
Nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing.

309
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,310
So you're screwed
on the time limit.

310
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,947
And, uh, even if you argue
your way around that,

311
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,383
the charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand.

312
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,854
Twenty grand
for molesting a child?

313
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,824
That is the way
the system is set up, yes.

314
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,494
The church is tough.

315
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,997
So your best shot
is to try these cases in the press,

316
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,066
uh, like I did
on Porter.

317
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,335
Mmm.
But most of the victims,

318
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,403
they don't want to have
anything to do with TV.

319
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:04,342
And, uh, Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.

320
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,312
Yeah. And if Garabedian can't get
his victims to go before the press,

321
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,081
then he's really...
that's right.

322
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,850
He has a long road
ahead of him.

323
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,687
My guess is he doesn't
have anything on law.

324
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,524
What? You think
he's bluffing or...

325
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:23,528
I think he's grandstanding
to cut a better deal.

326
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,031
Seems a bit reckless.

327
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,700
Have you met
Mitch Garabedian?

328
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,036
I asked you to write up
that motion, Bill.

329
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,005
I didn't ask you
to file it!

330
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,275
Mmm?

331
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,583
Hey, Bill.

332
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,063
Hi.

333
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,465
Who are you? I'm Mike Rezendes
from the<i> Boston Globe.</i>

334
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,301
I had an appointment
with you about an hour ago.

335
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,169
I can't talk to you.
I'm very busy. Sharon?

336
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,338
She went out for coffee.
She said she'd be right back.

337
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,840
I'm following up
on an article.

338
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,243
The one in the<i> Phoenix?</i>
No. In the<i> Globe.</i>

339
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,812
- Did you see the one in the<i> Phoenix?</i>
- No, I didn't.

340
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,148
I thought it was very good.
I have a copy here somewhere.

341
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,183
That's all right.
I'll track it down.

342
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:23,254
I'm actually following up on a column that
Eileen McNamara wrote about your suit.

343
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,022
<i>Suits.</i>
There are 84 of them.

344
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,592
It's not a class action.
You should get your facts straight.

345
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,594
No, you're right.
I should.

346
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,562
So I'm trying to get some
background information on...

347
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,431
you're not recording this,
are you?

348
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,766
Uh, no.
I wouldn't do that without asking.

349
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,768
I can't show you the church documents,
if that's what you're after.

350
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,339
- They're under seal.
- Yeah, I know that.

351
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,274
Did you know
they tried to bring me up

352
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,610
before the Massachusetts board
of bar overseers three times?

353
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,079
They're watching me very closely.
The church?

354
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,914
Yeah. The church. Yeah.

355
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,718
They'd like to get me disbarred.
In fact... put that away. Put it away.

356
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,686
Sure.
I don't want you recording this

357
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,355
in any way,
shape or form.

358
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,023
Not on paper,
not on tape, nothing.

359
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,759
In fact, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking to you, so...

360
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:06,197
look, Mr. Garabedian,
I know there's things you cannot tell me.

361
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,567
But I also know there's a story here,
and I think it's an important story.

362
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,469
I already talked
to the<i> Phoenix.</i>

363
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,239
Yeah, and there's a reason I didn't see it.
Nobody reads the<i> Phoenix</i> anymore.

364
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,974
They're broke.
They don't have any power.

365
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,143
The<i> Globe</i> does.

366
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,946
If we cover this story,
everybody will hear about it.

367
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,083
The church thinks in centuries,
Mr. Rezendes.

368
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,153
Do you think your paper
has the resources to take that on?

369
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,289
Yeah, I do.

370
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,959
But if you don't mind
me asking, do you?

371
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,095
I can't talk to you right now,
Mr. Rezendes.

372
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,897
I'm very, very busy.

373
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,834
Sharon?
Thank you.

374
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:47,471
Yep. Can I at least talk to some of
your clients? The victims?

375
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,840
I'd really
like to do that.

376
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,476
Call me tomorrow. I gotta think about it.
Yep. Thank you. Thanks.

377
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,532
I got more clips from the library.
Leave 'em right there.

378
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,569
Are you guys doing a story
on the church?

379
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,638
No, we are not doing
a story on the church.

380
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,907
Matt, you find anything
on this guy, Phil Saviano?

381
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,743
No. Who is he?

382
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,811
He's part of
a victims' organization.

383
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,814
Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.

384
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,550
There's a victims' organization?
Yeah.

385
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,854
It's called SNAP. It's, uh, Survivors
Network of those Abused by Priests.

386
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,956
- Crummy Acronym.
- Mmm.

387
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,094
You want me to track him down?
Yeah. Bring him in.

388
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,730
How much longer you need
to get through the clips?

389
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,766
I mean, a few days.
There's a lot.

390
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,701
Lisa's still sending up more.
Okay.

391
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,604
Hey, guys. I think
I got another Priest.

392
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,706
Liam Barrett.

393
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,708
Molested some kids
in Philly

394
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,676
and was moved
to Boston.

395
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,879
Did the same thing
and was moved again.

396
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,914
Really? That sounds
like Geoghan.

397
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,684
Is that one of our clips?
Yeah. Byline's Diego Ribadineira, 1997.

398
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,120
Must've been back when
he was working religion.

399
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,390
Was there any folo?
Not much. One short piece.

400
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,759
Huh.
The church settled the case.

401
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,597
Don't you know
Jim Sullivan?

402
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,800
Yeah. Why?

403
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,269
Looks like the church
brought him in to help out.

404
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:11,115
Jesus. Has anybody but manny gotten
the ball out of the infield?

405
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,551
Nope.
Why do you even bother with that thing?

406
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,619
It distracts me
from the game.

407
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,822
Know what else
is good for that?

408
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,924
Oh, yeah. Good idea.
My round.

409
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,626
I'll be right back.
Anybody want any food? No.

410
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,062
- I'm all set.
- Hey, a hot dog.

411
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,833
So, you guys making any progress?
Absolutely.

412
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,469
It's a good story.
Why?

413
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,938
'Cause you're another lapsed catholic
pissed off at the church?

414
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,240
We've got a lot of good stuff.
Like what?

415
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,777
I'm just watching the game.
<i>Omertà.</i>

416
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,513
They got another Priest...
Liam Barrett.

417
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,783
We reported on him.
I'm just saying, we did.

418
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,752
Okay, but this guy was shuffled around
from parish to parish every few years,

419
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,421
just like Geoghan
and Porter.

420
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,423
I think there's
a pattern.

421
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,692
Sounds thin.
What else you got?

422
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:58,829
Sacha's got another guy from a
victims' organization... Phil Saviano.

423
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,832
From SNAP? Oh, boy.
We reported on him too.

424
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,034
I thought you were
watching the game, Steve.

425
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,604
- That guy's pretty banged up.
- We did a couple stories on him.

426
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,272
Guy would not stop
writing letters.

427
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:11,041
He wants a Holy war.
What, so he's not worth talking to?

428
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,210
Where are you on Garabedian?
I'm working on it.

429
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,779
Robby says Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.

430
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,948
I think there's
something there, Ben.

431
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,117
Get me something solid,
or I'm taking you off it.

432
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,620
I don't want us
chasing our tails on this.

433
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,697
Stay away
from that trap!

434
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,233
You couldn't reach that trap
in a million years, partner.

435
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,302
I've reached
that trap before.

436
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,137
Yeah.
Now, Paul, maybe.

437
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,173
How we doing?
We're good.

438
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,577
We're two up on the front.
Good.

439
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,546
How's that new editor
working out?

440
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,814
Well, he doesn't
like baseball.

441
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:54,485
But, uh, he seems
like a smart guy.

442
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,353
Yeah, I read
an article about him.

443
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,924
Said he's the first Jewish editor
of the<i> Globe.</i>

444
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:02,927
Must have been
a slow news day.

445
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,195
He got a family, this guy?
No.

446
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,064
He is not married.

447
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,234
Divorced?
I don't think so, no.

448
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,337
So the new editor at the<i> Globe</i>
is an unmarried man of the Jewish faith

449
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,539
who hates baseball?

450
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,575
Yeah.
Should have given it to Ben.

451
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,276
He's a Bradlee,
for crying out loud.

452
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,113
Didn't raise his hand
fast enough, I guess.

453
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,515
Hey, by the way,

454
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:26,750
I've been reading about this Priest,
father Barrett.

455
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,452
Said you were involved
with that.

456
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,355
Barrett, yeah.
Bad egg.

457
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:34,558
Lake street asked for help.
I pitched in.

458
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,395
Victim said Cardinal law knew about Barrett
when he came from Philly.

459
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,964
Is that true?

460
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,800
You know I can't talk
about the case, Robby.

461
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,070
Well... off the record?

462
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:48,639
Off the record,
I can't talk about it.

463
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,609
All right.
This related to the lawsuit?

464
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,210
You know about that?

465
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,246
Look,

466
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,716
I don't know this guy Baron
or what his agenda is.

467
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,985
Frankly, I don't care.

468
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,554
I just don't want to see you
taking a bullet for him.

469
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,789
I think you're away.

470
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,063
- Put it over here.
- Let's go. Let's go.

471
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:17,001
<i>So the other day
I was on the World Wide Web.</i>

472
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,470
<i>Anything you want to know,
it's right there.</i>

473
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,840
Now, I have to admit
that as a Priest,

474
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,342
this makes me
a little nervous.

475
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,312
Should I be worried
about job security?

476
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,248
I don't think so.

477
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,852
<i>You see,
knowledge is one thing.</i>

478
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,522
<i>But faith...
faith is another.</i>

479
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,539
Hey.

480
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,241
Hey.

481
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,045
Shouldn't you be
golfing or something?

482
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,946
Golfing's not a verb.

483
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,015
And I couldn't get
a tee time.

484
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,351
Is that what they call it?
Tee time?

485
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,853
They also call it
a leisure activity.

486
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,356
You oughta try it, Mike.
I do. I run.

487
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,358
Yeah. You run to work.

488
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,129
So why are you
here today?

489
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,732
Going over these clips of Saviano.
Yep.

490
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:25,469
Ben and Steve think it's a dead end.
They gave me a bunch of crap about it at the game.

491
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,304
Yeah, Ben e-mailed me.

492
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,840
He did?
Yeah.

493
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,409
He said
we should let it go.

494
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,478
What do you want to do?

495
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,680
I want to bring Saviano in.

496
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:39,149
So, just ignore those guys?

497
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,855
I think we oughta start
ignoring everybody on this one.

498
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,725
I'm good with that.

499
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,393
Well...

500
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,898
do you think Marty has any idea
what's coming down the pike?

501
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,001
Nope.
I don't think he cares either.

502
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,070
That's refreshing.

503
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,172
Yeah.

504
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,175
Unless he's wrong.

505
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,864
<i>I've always been fascinated
with the newspaper business.</i>

506
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:31,468
I used to sit in on the lectures with the
neiman fellows when I was at Harvard.

507
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,739
I, uh... I read that you
were an editor once.

508
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,208
Ah, yes.

509
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,744
Yeah, that was
a very long time ago.

510
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,113
The<i> Mississippi Register.</i>

511
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:47,284
Small diocesan newspaper.

512
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:52,756
But for a 30-year-old pastor,
it was a big responsibility.

513
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,458
Too much at times.

514
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,027
How so?

515
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,298
I was close
with the evers brothers.

516
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,934
We took a stand
on civil rights.

517
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:07,004
Our readership
was not pleased.

518
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,373
They saw me
as a meddling outsider.

519
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,676
I can imagine.

520
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:17,347
Tough seat to sit in,
especially in a small town.

521
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:21,418
I think you'll find that Boston's still
a small town too, Marty,

522
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,853
in many ways.

523
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,521
Hmm.

524
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:29,193
But if I can be of any help, Marty,
don't hesitate to ask.

525
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,196
I find
that the city flourishes

526
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,565
when its great institutions
work together.

527
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,801
Thank you.

528
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:41,004
Personally I'm of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function,

529
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,041
it really needs
to stand alone.

530
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,945
Ah. Of course.

531
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,014
But my offer still stands.

532
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,717
Thank you.

533
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,819
Come in.

534
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,554
Ah.

535
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,124
Thank you, Maureen.

536
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,962
A little gift, Marty.

537
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:10,701
Think of it as a Cardinal's guide
to the city of Boston.

538
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,319
I'm here to see
Sacha Pfeiffer.

539
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,722
Your name?
Phil Saviano.

540
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,557
Okay, just a minute.
Mm-hmm.

541
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,927
So, am I the first survivor
you've talked to?

542
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,562
Yeah, Phil, you are.

543
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,764
Okay, well,

544
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:45,102
first of all let me say thank you
for having me in today.

545
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:49,339
And I want you to know that you have the
full cooperation of my organization, SNAP.

546
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,441
How many members are in
your organization, Phil?

547
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,944
We had 11
at our last chapter meeting...

548
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:56,446
uh, no, um, 10.
Karen just moved.

549
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,182
You had a woman in your group?
Of course.

550
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,518
They don't discriminate,
not when it comes to abuse.

551
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,587
And this has nothing to do
with being gay.

552
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,189
What this is is Priests
using the collar to rape kids.

553
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,759
Kids.
Boys and girls.

554
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,534
I was 11,

555
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:21,471
and I was preyed upon by father
David Holley in Worcester.

556
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:24,308
And I don't mean prayed for.
I mean preyed upon.

557
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,079
- Are any of you catholic?
- I was raised catholic.

558
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:32,649
Now I go to my wife's
presbyterian church.

559
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,251
I'm lapsed.

560
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,320
I go to church
with my grandmother sometimes.

561
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:39,957
It's safe to say we were all
raised catholic, but now...

562
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,825
not so much.
Okay.

563
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,827
Well, let me tell you,

564
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:47,631
when you're a poor kid from a poor family,
religion counts for a lot.

565
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,301
And when a Priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.

566
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:55,105
He asks you to collect the hymnals or
take out the trash, you feel special.

567
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,341
It's like God
asking for help.

568
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:00,444
So maybe it's a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke.

569
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:05,082
But now you got a secret together,
so you go along.

570
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:08,485
Then he shows you a porno mag,
and you go along.

571
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,921
And you go along,
and you go along,

572
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:14,424
until one day he asks you to jerk him off
or give him a blow job.

573
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,794
And so you go along with that too
because you feel trapped,

574
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,430
because he has groomed you.

575
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,933
How do you say no
to God, right?

576
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:27,938
See, it is important to understand
that this is not just physical abuse.

577
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,607
It's spiritual abuse too.

578
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:35,612
And when a Priest does this to you,
he robs you of your faith.

579
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,814
So you reach for the bottle
or the needle,

580
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,650
or if those don't work,
you jump off a bridge.

581
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,786
That's why
we call ourselves survivors.

582
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,789
Have you read Jason Berry's book?
He wrote about the Gauthe case in Louisiana.

583
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,025
That's G... G-A-U-T-H-E.

584
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,227
Here. And talk to Richard Sipe.

585
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,529
He worked in one of the church's
treatment centers.

586
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,599
He's an ex-Priest.
Married a nun.

587
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,803
Here. This is his testimony
from the Kos case.

588
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,371
Phil, what's a treatment center?

589
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,573
It's where they send Priests
when they get caught.

590
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,576
This is all here in the box.
I sent this to you guys five years ago.

591
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,247
Uh, to the<i> Globe?</i>
Who did you send it to?

592
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,751
I don't wanna say who, but they
said they weren't interested.

593
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:18,021
But we did run a couple stories on you.
I saw them in the clips.

594
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:21,491
Yeah, but to be completely frank,
it wasn't enough.

595
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,595
You guys gotta understand.

596
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,164
This is big.

597
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:31,034
This is not just Boston.
It's the whole country. It's the whole world.

598
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,103
And it goes right up
to the Vatican.

599
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,272
Do you have any proof
of that, Phil?

600
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,774
No. Not yet.
But there are so many of them.

601
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,110
How else could they
have hidden it for so long?

602
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:43,080
- So many what?
- Priests!

603
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,248
Priests!

604
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,584
I know of 13
right here in Boston.

605
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,288
You know 13 Priests in Boston
who have molested children?

606
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,857
Yeah! Why do you keep
repeating everything I say?

607
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,226
I just like to clarify things.

608
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:59,896
Maybe you should have clarified it five years
ago when I sent you all of this stuff.

609
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,199
It's all right here.

610
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,809
May I use
your bathroom?

611
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,378
Yeah, sure, Phil.
Come on.

612
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,988
Well,
what do you think?

613
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,491
Well, the guy's got an agenda,
that's for sure.

614
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,559
You think?
He's obviously been through a lot.

615
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,428
But he's smart,
and if he's right about 13 Priests...

616
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,831
yeah, it might be a big "if" with this guy.
Do a background check on him.

617
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,400
And follow up with some
of the other survivors of his group.

618
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,803
I'll track down
this ex-Priest, Sipe.

619
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,671
Okay, but stay on Garabedian.
That's more important.

620
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,274
Ah. Garabedian.
What a pain in the ass.

621
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:47,144
You can be
a pain in the ass, Mike.

622
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,712
Mmm.

623
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,159
Mitchell, what a surprise.
How are you?

624
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,860
I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes.
Good.

625
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,429
I haven't heard back from you.
I left you a couple of messages.

626
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,632
I've been very busy.
I-I don't have time for calls.

627
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:11,001
I'm sure you don't.
Listen, listen, Mitch.

628
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:14,137
Let me talk to a couple of the victims.
You could sit in on the interview.

629
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,106
If you're not happy,
you could kill it.

630
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,708
I spoke to my clients. They don't want
to be in the press. I'm sorry.

631
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,144
I get that, but I don't
need to name names.

632
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,513
I don't believe you, Mr. Rezendes.
I'm sure you don't.

633
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,016
Listen, Mitchell.
Look, Mr. Rezendes, please...

634
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,186
I'm not writing a profile here.
I'm working on something bigger.

635
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,354
Bigger? I don't know
what that means.

636
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,624
I'm not supposed to tell you this,
but I'm digging around for Spotlight.

637
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,161
Spotlight's on this?
Yeah, we're looking into it.

638
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:42,465
But you gotta help me. You gotta let me
talk to some of these victims. Please.

639
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,970
Please.

640
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,742
Come back tomorrow, 9:30 am.

641
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,477
Thank you.

642
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,391
Ms. Pfeiffer?
Joe?

643
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,759
Oh, shoot!

644
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,761
That's okay.
Sorry. Please sit.

645
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,430
Thank you.

646
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,333
Is this table okay?
This is perfect.

647
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:19,236
I had a muffin
while I was waiting.

648
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,339
Two, actually.
I eat when I'm nervous.

649
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,708
I do that too,
actually.

650
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,844
I hope I'm not late.
Phil told me 1:00.

651
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:31,114
No, you're fine.
I got here early.

652
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,350
About an hour.

653
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,455
Um, would you mind if I took some notes?
Would that be all right?

654
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,296
You don't mind if I
take some notes, do you?

655
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,132
- Are you gonna use my name?
- No.

656
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,868
Not if you
don't want me to, no.

657
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,803
I just had a kid.

658
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,873
He's only one, but I'm not sure
I want him to know about this.

659
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,808
Sure. I get that.

660
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,978
You can stop this interview at
any time, Patrick. All right?

661
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,713
Okay.
All right.

662
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,484
Go ahead with your notes.

663
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,452
Okay. So, um...

664
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,556
where'd you live
when it first happened?

665
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,660
In the projects,
over in Hyde Park.

666
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,495
Over by the Stop & Shop?

667
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:21,331
Yeah. You know it?

668
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,566
Yeah, I drove a cab
for a few years.

669
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,336
Open early.
Bad coffee, right?

670
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,405
Yeah. I guess.

671
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,175
How old were you
when it happened?

672
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,843
I was 12.

673
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,013
Just after my dad
killed himself.

674
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:39,516
Oh, geez.

675
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:41,484
He was a real
piece of shit.

676
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,787
And my Mom,
she wasn't so stable either.

677
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,189
How do you mean?
I mean she was nuts.

678
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,124
She was
a schizophrenic.

679
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,759
Same shit.

680
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,530
When did you
first meet Geoghan?

681
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:59,703
Well, my sister, she saw him
over in the Dunkin' Donuts.

682
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,639
Tells him about my old man passing,
and he rushed right over.

683
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:06,710
This nun, sister Barbara, ran this
group for kids from troubled families.

684
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,212
Mm-hmm.
Where was that?

685
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,381
Uh, St. Ambrose
in Dorchester.

686
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,183
Okay.

687
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,785
She's the one who introduced me
to father Shanley.

688
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,222
He was a street Priest.

689
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,158
Long hair. Very hip.

690
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,828
He invited me to his apartment
in back bay.

691
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,697
Where in Back Bay?
Beacon Street.

692
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,033
Beacon. Okay.
Are you from here?

693
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,870
Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio,
but my Mom's from Southie.

694
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,807
All right, so you get it.
I'd never even seen back bay.

695
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,679
So what happened
on that first visit, Joe?

696
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,816
Well, he was very nice at first,
very funny, very casual.

697
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,820
And I think
he could tell I was gay,

698
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,257
so he showed me this mobile he had,
like over a baby's crib.

699
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:57,660
Mm-hmm.
But with different words.

700
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,697
"Homosexual."
"Transsexual." "Bisexual."

701
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,600
Okay. And did you know
you were gay at that time, Joe?

702
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,668
Yeah.

703
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,105
But that wasn't information I was sharing
with anybody. Not in Dorchester.

704
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,841
Okay.

705
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,844
So, what happened
after he showed you the mobile?

706
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,781
Well, I was
a little freaked out.

707
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,517
I think he could tell.

708
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,154
So he said, you know, what'll help
is if we play strip poker.

709
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,590
Of course I lost.

710
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,960
And, uh, things
went on from there.

711
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,531
Can you tell me
specifically what happened?

712
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,201
Specifically, he...

713
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,936
he molested me.

714
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,310
Joe, I think that the language
is gonna be so important here.

715
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:50,747
We can't sanitize this.
Just saying "molest" isn't enough.

716
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,716
People need to know
what actually happened.

717
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,155
We should probably get these to go.
Right.

718
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:02,992
Geoghan shows up, and my Mom,
you know, she's...

719
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,661
she's thrilled.

720
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,931
I mean, this was like God
showing up, you know?

721
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,800
Sure. Right.
So what happened then?

722
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,338
You really want
to hear this shit?

723
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,907
Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.

724
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,518
He offers to take me
to get ice cream.

725
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,754
You know, he's a Priest,
I'm a kid, so I go.

726
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,523
Sure.

727
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,892
So we're driving home and he...

728
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,830
he starts patting my leg and...

729
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,067
you know, then...

730
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,805
His hand just slides
right up and he...

731
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,040
he grabs my dick.

732
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,543
You know, I...
I just froze up.

733
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:56,779
I was fucking petrified.
I-I couldn't move.

734
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,782
I didn't know what to do.
I was just a little kid.

735
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,119
Yeah.

736
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,726
You know, I never even
touched my ice cream.

737
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,128
It just melted down my arm.

738
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,069
Did you, um...

739
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,107
did you see him again
after that?

740
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,647
Yeah.

741
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,186
All right. That's good.
Let's stop there for now.

742
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,555
Sure.

743
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,758
He said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.

744
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,661
Mmm. So what happened
after that?

745
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:47,430
Well, he took off
his clothes and he said,

746
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,065
"I've been so depressed,

747
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,168
but maybe you can cheer me up
and give me a blow job."

748
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,836
Classy guy.

749
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,307
And did you?
Yeah.

750
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,343
I know you
must be thinking,

751
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:03,780
why would I ever do that to some creepy
guy who's 30 years older than me?

752
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:07,917
But what you have to understand is
that this is the first time in my life

753
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,520
that someone told me
that it was okay to be gay.

754
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:13,389
And it was a Priest.
Right.

755
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,525
So you had oral sex.

756
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:18,027
Did you have
intercourse?

757
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,562
Yes.

758
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,764
Not then, but later.

759
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,968
It really messed me up.

760
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:29,806
I'm sober now, but that... that was
the beginning of it all.

761
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,811
It's very confusing,
you know,

762
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,981
to be introduced to sex
like that and then...

763
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:40,383
and then to be
attracted to men, it's...

764
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,888
I'm sorry.
I knew I was gonna do this.

765
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,824
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

766
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,926
It's okay, Joe.
It's okay.

767
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:52,061
Of course there is
a church right there.

768
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,831
And a playground.

769
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,500
Joe, did you ever
try and tell anyone?

770
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:00,236
Like who? A Priest?

771
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,739
Can I use your phone?

772
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,174
Yeah, sure.
You know where it is.

773
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,377
You can use my name
if you want.

774
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,846
Thanks, Patrick.

775
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:13,082
Don't thank me. Just get
these assholes, will you?

776
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,257
He's one of the lucky ones.

777
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,427
He's still alive.

778
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,971
Do you want a cup of tea, Sacha?
I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.

779
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,010
<i>Hello?</i> Hi, Joe.
It's Sacha Pfeiffer.

780
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,379
<i>Hi, Sacha. How are you?</i>
I'm good, thanks.

781
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:47,483
Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to
follow up on one thing.

782
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:50,119
You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?

783
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,488
<i>Yeah, I did.
I went to a couple of SNAP meetings.</i>

784
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,558
And did Phil ever suggest
you do anything about it?

785
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,461
<i>No. The meetings
weren't really about that.</i>

786
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:02,198
<i>A couple of them had gone to a lawyer,
but I didn't think it was worth it.</i>

787
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,833
Why not?

788
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:06,669
<i>There were just so many forms to fill out.
It was overwhelming.</i>

789
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:09,238
<i>And he said he could only get me
a small settlement, so...</i>

790
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,974
wh-who said that?
<i>The lawyer told me that.</i>

791
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,978
So you<i> did</i> go
and see a lawyer?

792
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,083
<i>Yeah, but I didn't end up using him,
so I didn't think it was important.</i>

793
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:22,418
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to hide anything.</i>

794
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,087
No, I-I-I know, Joe.

795
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,656
Do you remember his name?
The lawyer?

796
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:29,525
<i>No. But maybe Phil
would know.</i>

797
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:33,763
<i>The guy was on TV a lot during the
Porter case. He was handsome.</i>

798
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:35,331
Was it Eric Macleish?

799
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,867
<i>Yeah, that's it.
Macleish.</i>

800
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,902
<i>I thought
he was very handsome.</i>

801
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:44,574
- Hey.
- Hey.

802
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,777
I was just in the newsroom.
Judge Sweeney set a date for the hearing.

803
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,946
Really? When?
Two weeks.

804
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,447
In Springfield.
Oh.

805
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,616
Canellos started a pool.
Ten bucks to get in.

806
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:56,285
Anyone picking the<i> Globe?</i>

807
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,607
He's only taking bets
on how fast Sweeney rules against us.

808
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,024
Robby.
<i>Hi. It's me.</i>

809
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,693
<i>Did you get my message?</i>
I did.

810
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:05,928
Looks like father Shanley
could be our fourth Priest.

811
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,563
<i>Yeah, I think he is.</i>

812
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,299
Did you follow up with Macleish?
<i>I just talked to Phil.</i>

813
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,468
<i>He said Macleish dealt
with a number of these cases.</i>

814
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,104
<i>Guess he forgot</i>
<i>to mention that.</i> Yeah.

815
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,106
I'm gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow,

816
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,776
see if I can find any cases
he settled against the church.

817
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,078
<i>All right. Call me after you do.
Good night.</i>

818
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,646
Okay. Good night.

819
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,984
Hey.

820
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:29,986
You wanted to, uh, chat?
Yeah.

821
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,889
I'm late for a dinner.
Wanna walk me out? Sure.

822
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,827
Geez. Does that guy ever go home?
Apparently not.

823
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:41,597
I got guys who won't leave till he does.
He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.

824
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,501
Where are we on Geoghan?
Following up on more victims.

825
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,471
I want to expand the investigation.
Why?

826
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:51,774
We got a fourth Priest.
There might be as many as 13.

827
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:53,843
Thirteen?
Yeah.

828
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:56,445
Who's your source?
Phil Saviano.

829
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:59,315
Jesus Christ, Robby. I told Mike
that guy's a fuckin'... I know, I know.

830
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,684
I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.

831
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,587
Want to elaborate
on that?

832
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,856
No. Not really.

833
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,393
It just feels like this thing's stacking up.
That's my gut.

834
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,498
Okay.
Okay. Good.

835
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,233
Thank you.

836
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,310
Hello?

837
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,145
<i>Mr. Rezendes?</i>

838
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,780
Uh, yeah. Who's this?

839
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,548
<i>It's Richard Sipe.</i>

840
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,817
Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard.
How are you?

841
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,619
<i>I'm good.</i>
Uh, thanks for calling.

842
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:39,655
Look, uh, Phil Saviano
g-gave me your name.

843
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,058
I was wondering if I could ask you
a few questions.

844
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,559
<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>
Great.

845
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,295
Uh, so Phil told me
that you were working

846
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:49,565
a-at one of the church's
treatment centers in Baltimore.

847
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:52,401
<i>Yes. The Seton
Psychiatric Institute.</i>

848
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,403
<i>It was run by
the daughters of charity.</i>

849
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,874
And, uh,
when was that, Richard?

850
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:02,378
<i>Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965,</i>

851
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,547
okay.
<i>And I was there for five years,</i>

852
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,584
<i>but I spent the next 30 studying
abusive Priests and their victims.</i>

853
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,086
Really?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

854
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,188
And that's... that's been
your sole focus?

855
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,093
<i>Look, Mike, the church wants us to believe
that it's just a few bad apples.</i>

856
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,061
<i>But it's a much bigger problem
than that.</i>

857
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,863
How much bigger, Richard?

858
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,899
<i>Well, based on the research,</i>

859
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:26,669
<i>I would classify it as a recognizable
psychiatric phenomenon.</i>

860
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,472
That's big.

861
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,945
Hey, Mac.
Hey.

862
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:39,582
If I wanted historical data on a Priest,
parishes he's been assigned to,

863
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,050
where would I find that?

864
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,853
The Geoghan case? It's all in the clips.
Lisa has the source material.

865
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:46,789
What if it was for another Priest, one that
hadn't been in the papers?

866
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,692
You're looking at another Priest?
Who you looking at?

867
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,260
Any ideas?

868
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,063
Come on, Matt.
You're not gonna tell me?

869
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,499
I gotta get to a meeting.
Thanks, Mac. Hey, Steve.

870
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,771
The archdiocese puts out an annual directory,
every Priest and parish.

871
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,306
That's great.

872
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:05,541
Do these go back
any further than '98?

873
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,810
Oh, yeah. Going back
to the '80s in the Mez.

874
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,445
Beyond that,
you gotta go to BPL.

875
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,048
The Mez, huh?
Thanks, Lisa. You bet.

876
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,785
He said they all target
the same kind of kid.

877
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:19,488
Low-income families,
absentee fathers, broken homes.

878
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,658
So a guy like Geoghan goes after boys
not because he prefers them,

879
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,428
but because they have more shame,
less likely to talk.

880
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,096
Hmm.

881
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,764
These guys are predators, Robby.
Yeah.

882
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,333
I-I-I talked to Sipe.

883
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:33,269
He said he's seen dozens of them
in the '60s in Seton.

884
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,937
He called it
a "phenomenon."

885
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,672
Why didn't he go public?
He did.

886
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,308
But the church made a huge effort
to discredit him.

887
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,478
Smear campaigns,
public statements by prominent bishops.

888
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,348
It's just like Saviano said.
And Garabedian.

889
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,484
You getting anywhere with him?
More victims.

890
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,653
More victims.
You can't empty his pockets?

891
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,855
I'll get to him.
I just need more time.

892
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:54,757
Come on, Mike.
You gotta get him.

893
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,525
I'll get him.
I'll get him.

894
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:00,997
Jesus. What the hell
is that smell?

895
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,432
There's a dead rat
in the corner.

896
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,267
What have you got?
Church directories.

897
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:09,038
It's every Priest in Massachusetts,
what parish they're assigned to.

898
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,540
Are these official?
Yeah. I figured it could help us track down

899
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,543
some of the Priests Saviano mentioned,
maybe find some more victims.

900
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:16,712
Can we turn on some more lights?
I couldn't find the switch.

901
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,048
You wanna borrow my glasses?
No, I'm good. I'm good.

902
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,816
Look. 1983.

903
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,719
John Geoghan,
St. Brendan's parish, Dorchester.

904
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,188
So we can find out
where any Priest is in any given year?

905
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,958
Yeah, I got him here
at...

906
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,060
huh.
What?

907
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,195
1980. The year Geoghan
was pulled from JP.

908
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,031
It says he's
on sick leave.

909
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,133
Come on.
It really says that?

910
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,903
Where is, uh, 1991?

911
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:42,571
Yeah. Here ya go.

912
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:45,041
Let me see this.
Barrett. Barrett. Liam.

913
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,743
I can't read that.
Look for a Liam Barrett in there.

914
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:51,213
1991's the year they pulled him
out of Charlestown.

915
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,350
"Barrett, Liam."

916
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,819
Yeah.
- "Sick leave."

917
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,889
It's an official
designation.

918
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,592
Let's get these upstairs.

919
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,928
Matt, check on those Priests
Saviano gave us.

920
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,431
Robby.
<i>I'm down at the courthouse.</i>

921
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:10,199
Something's not right here.

922
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,935
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.
Okay, thanks.

923
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:16,539
Um, we need to talk to Macleish again.
<i>Really. Why?</i>

924
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:20,242
Huh? There's nothing here.
There aren't any records.

925
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,716
Thanks for waiting.
So sorry, guys. Stuck on a call.

926
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,618
Not a problem.
How are you? Good.

927
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,587
Thanks for meeting us.
You bet. What's up, guys?

928
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,424
Mr. Macleish, are you familiar with
a Priest named Paul Shanley?

929
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,294
Yes, I am familiar
with him.

930
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,898
And have you settled cases
against father Shanley?

931
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,536
As I'm sure you can understand,
I can't discuss that with you.

932
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:51,574
Yeah, h-how about, uh,
father Ronald Paquin?

933
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:56,579
Well, I can't discuss that
with you either. Come on, guys.

934
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,281
We understand you've settled
several cases against each of them.

935
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,318
Even if I'd been involved
in those cases,

936
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,120
the settlements
would be confidential

937
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:07,223
and I could be disbarred
for acknowledging their existence.

938
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,226
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

939
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:12,394
Look, I told you guys
these are tough cases.

940
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,765
Most of these folks, they just want
some acknowledgment

941
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,501
of what happened.

942
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:21,170
We got 'em a sit-down
with the bishop and a little dough,

943
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,072
and that's the best
they could hope for.

944
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:28,010
Well, it's certainly the best the<i> Priests</i>
could hope for.

945
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:31,480
No, the church promised
they'd take the Priests out of circulation.

946
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,416
And did you follow up on that?

947
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,789
Do you guys need anything else?

948
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,692
Yes. Why aren't there
any records?

949
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:45,794
I was down
at the courthouse earlier.

950
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,930
There aren't any records
of any of these settlements.

951
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,501
We dealt directly
with the church.

952
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:58,674
We would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery.

953
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:02,211
- You never filed anything in court?
- It's a private mediation.

954
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,880
So, this is just you

955
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:09,485
and the archdiocese's lawyers
in a room?

956
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:12,154
- Correct.
- Anyone else?

957
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:15,891
Occasionally the church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out.

958
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,760
You have names?

959
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,030
Nope. No, I don't.

960
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,033
So this was all
under the table?

961
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,068
There's no paper trail
at all.

962
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,138
The victim has to sign a confidentiality
agreement to get the settlement.

963
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,174
The lawyer takes a third,
and the church sweeps it under the rug.

964
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:35,077
It's a freakin' Racket.
It's more complicated than that.

965
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:38,514
Macleish has got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can.

966
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:42,351
Sure. But how many victims do you represent
and profit from before you say something?

967
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,486
Garabedian would say none.

968
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,522
That's why he's taking
these cases to court.

969
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:49,058
He wants people to know about this.
I agree.

970
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,227
And legal ethics aside, Ben,

971
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,062
I mean, operating
the way Macleish has

972
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:56,599
all but guarantees that
the abuse stays under wraps.

973
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:59,702
Yeah. Did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's Priests?

974
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:04,440
No. He's limited by his
confidentiality agreement.

975
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:07,443
But clearly he's settled cases
against a number of them.

976
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,778
Phil's put me in touch
with some of the other victims.

977
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,348
I'm pretty confident all of his Priests
are gonna check out.

978
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,850
So it is 13 Priests?

979
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:17,620
- Yeah.
- Looks that way.

980
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:19,688
Holy shit.

981
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,426
Okay. Keep going.

982
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,765
I'm sorry.
What was the name again?

983
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,534
Uh, Baron.

984
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,639
B-A-R-O-N.

985
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:39,808
I'm having trouble finding it.
Just give me a second.

986
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,278
It's okay, Kim.
I can vouch for him.

987
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,214
I'm Pete Conley.
I'm on the Board of Catholic Charities.

988
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:46,915
Welcome to Boston,
Mr. Baron.

989
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,652
Thank you.
I appreciate you joining us.

990
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:53,389
We're very proud of the work
we do here in Boston.

991
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:56,158
Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.

992
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,826
Yes, we did.

993
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:02,064
He's an extraordinary man.
I'm glad you had a chance to chat.

994
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,346
Enjoying yourself?

995
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:21,817
Uh, to be honest,
these events aren't really my strong suit.

996
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,753
Yeah. Are you involved
with the charity?

997
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:27,256
Not directly, no.
Several of my friends are.

998
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,825
We all went to high school
at BC High.

999
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,461
That's the school across the street
from the<i> Globe.</i>

1000
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:34,563
It's hard to miss.
Yeah.

1001
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,199
Hard to get away from too,
apparently.

1002
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:42,971
The, uh, Cardinal's
in the corner,

1003
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:44,540
if you're so inclined.

1004
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,642
We've met.
Really?

1005
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:48,877
Did he mention
the suit?

1006
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:51,880
No, but he did give me
a copy of the catechism.

1007
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,182
Yeah.

1008
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,651
Well, the Cardinal's
not known for his subtlety.

1009
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,386
During the Porter investigation,

1010
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:01,223
he literally called down
the power of God on the<i> Globe.</i>

1011
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:02,958
How'd that play out?

1012
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,695
A week later, our editor
broke his leg skiing.

1013
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,798
Shrimp toast,
gentlemen?

1014
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,934
Uh, no, thanks.
Thanks.

1015
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,306
You said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint?

1016
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:20,075
Yeah, there were
a few of them.

1017
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,910
But the judge had
the case records sealed

1018
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:24,046
after friends
of the church complained.

1019
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,148
And the church
has a lot of friends.

1020
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,583
Like Eric Macleish?

1021
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,586
Yeah.

1022
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:33,589
Let's just say he's not
part of the solution.

1023
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,758
You follow what I'm saying?
Sure.

1024
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,760
You work hard,
Mr. Rezendes.

1025
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:40,662
Are you married?
Yeah.

1026
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:44,733
Your wife doesn't mind you working
all the time? Oh, yeah, she does.

1027
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,605
That's why I never got married.
I'm too busy.

1028
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:51,940
What I do
is too important.

1029
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,675
Mmm.

1030
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,447
Your new editor,
he's a Jew, right?

1031
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,115
That's right. Yeah.

1032
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,117
Well, see, he comes in

1033
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,620
and suddenly everybody's
interested in the church.

1034
00:57:04,622 --> 00:57:06,789
You know why?
Mmm.

1035
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,392
Because it takes
an outsider, like me.

1036
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,094
I'm Armenian.

1037
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,163
How many Armenians
do you know in Boston?

1038
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,366
Steve Kurkjian.
Works at the<i> Globe.</i>

1039
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:21,637
Oh. That's two.
You should get a prize or something.

1040
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:24,940
What are you, Italian?
No, I'm Portuguese.

1041
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,143
From where?
Uh, East Boston.

1042
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,147
Really? East Boston?

1043
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,317
You don't sound like it.

1044
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:45,994
This city, these people...

1045
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,664
making the rest of us feel
like we don't belong.

1046
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,999
But they're no better than us.

1047
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,135
Look at how they treat
their children.

1048
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,105
Mark my words, Mr. Rezendes,

1049
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,508
if it takes a village
to raise a child,

1050
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,277
it takes a village
to abuse one.

1051
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,349
Hey, here he is.

1052
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:09,518
Want a beer?
Love one.

1053
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,019
Another.

1054
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:14,356
You here with Barbara?
No, no. She hates these things.

1055
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:15,624
Karen too.
Yeah.

1056
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,192
Smart ladies.

1057
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,760
<i>Sláinte.
Sláinte.</i>

1058
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,698
Mmm. I met
your new editor.

1059
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,433
Seemed like
a decent fellow.

1060
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:26,101
I think he is.

1061
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,672
Hey, I had
an interesting conversation

1062
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,808
with Eric Macleish
the other day.

1063
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:37,846
Turns out he's been settling abuse cases
with the Archdiocese for years.

1064
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,183
You really want
to talk about this here?

1065
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:47,289
Jim, you said you helped out
on father Barrett as a favor.

1066
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,124
That was a one-off?

1067
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:56,031
How many of these cases
you been involved with?

1068
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,800
You know I can't answer that, Robby.
It's unethical.

1069
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,770
Is that all it is?

1070
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:08,210
So,<i> this</i> would be
the Robby Robinson

1071
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,579
I've always heard about
but never met.

1072
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,247
Huh?

1073
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,550
Listen to me, Jimmy.

1074
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:16,718
You want to be
on the right side of this.

1075
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,590
This is the church
you're talking about, Robby.

1076
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:23,559
Look around.
These are good people.

1077
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,661
Done a lot of good
for this city.

1078
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,797
Enjoy the party.

1079
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,841
I've been through
a lot of these now.

1080
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:41,543
"Sick leave" isn't
the only designation they use

1081
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,779
when they take one of these Priests
out of circulation.

1082
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:46,014
They use a slew of terms:
"Absent on leave,"

1083
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:48,417
"unassigned,"
"emergency response."

1084
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:51,186
They got a word for everything, these guys.
Except rape.

1085
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,722
And they move parishes
way more frequently than other Priests.

1086
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:57,059
When I was a kid, a Priest moved after
seven or eight years, sometimes longer.

1087
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,628
These guys, it's two
to three years tops.

1088
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,030
And did they use these designations
for all of Saviano's Priests?

1089
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,266
Yeah.
It's a pretty clear pattern.

1090
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,268
Guys, I got Sipe.

1091
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,304
<i>I think if you really want
to understand the crisis,</i>

1092
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,940
<i>you need to start
with the celibacy requirement.</i>

1093
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,042
<i>That was my first major finding.</i>

1094
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,845
<i>Only 50% of the clergy
are celibate.</i>

1095
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:21,216
<i>Now, most of them are having sex
with other adults.</i>

1096
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,152
<i>But the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy</i>

1097
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:27,322
<i>that tolerates
and even protects pedophiles.</i>

1098
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,158
So you believe
the church

1099
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,461
is aware of the extent
of this, uh, crisis?

1100
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:33,762
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

1101
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,731
<i>After the first major scandal
in Louisiana,</i>

1102
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:39,067
<i>Tom Doyle, the secretary canonist
for the Papal Nuncio,</i>

1103
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,937
<i>co-authored a report
warning pedophile Priests</i>

1104
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:44,339
<i>were a billion-dollar
liability.</i>

1105
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,174
<i>That was in 1985.</i>

1106
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:47,609
1985?

1107
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:49,244
<i>That's right.</i>

1108
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:52,247
Who saw that report?
Anyone from the catholic hierarchy?

1109
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:55,417
<i>Sure. Doyle tried
to introduce the report</i>

1110
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:57,786
<i>at the national conference
of catholic bishops.</i>

1111
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:01,790
<i>In fact, Cardinal law
initially helped to fund the report.</i>

1112
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:03,992
<i>But then he backed out
and they shelved it.</i>

1113
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:07,529
Is he kidding me?
Uh, Richard, Robby here.

1114
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:12,200
We think we have 13 Priests in Boston
that fit this pattern,

1115
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:16,038
which would be a very...
a very big story.

1116
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,975
Does that sound right to you,
uh, in terms of scale?

1117
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:23,679
<i>No, not really, Robby.
Sounds low to me.</i>

1118
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:28,016
<i>My estimates suggest six percent
act out sexually with minors.</i>

1119
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,786
Uh, six percent
of what?

1120
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,954
<i>Six percent of all Priests.</i>

1121
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,956
How many Priests
do we have in Boston?

1122
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,892
About 1,500.
One percent is 15.

1123
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:40,429
Six percent is... 90.

1124
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,999
Wait.
Nine-ninety Priests?

1125
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,801
Is that possible?

1126
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:49,237
<i>From a metric standpoint, yes.</i>

1127
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:52,307
<i>That would certainly
be in line with my findings.</i>

1128
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,148
<i>Hello?</i>
Uh...

1129
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,985
ninety fucking Priests?
In Boston?

1130
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:06,221
That's what he said.

1131
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,391
If there were 90 of these bastards,
people would know.

1132
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:10,926
Maybe they do.

1133
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,261
And no one said
a thing?

1134
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,230
Good Germans.

1135
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,499
I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publicly.

1136
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:20,736
Macleish knew.
He just didn't say anything.

1137
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,337
That's 13 Priests.

1138
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:24,439
There's a big difference
between 13 and 90.

1139
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:26,241
Where's this guy Sipe
getting his numbers?

1140
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,276
Well, he's been
studying it for 30 years.

1141
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,679
He is a trained psychotherapist.
Okay.

1142
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:33,749
But we need something more than a metric
from some hippie ex-Priest

1143
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:35,450
who's shacking up
with a nun.

1144
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:38,854
Okay, so we'll track down more victims.
We'll get more Priests.

1145
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:41,456
Then we could check them
against the directories.

1146
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,459
- That's a shitload of victims.
- We'll get there.

1147
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,928
How long's it gonna take?

1148
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,864
Too long.

1149
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,466
Wait. Meeting's over?

1150
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,335
Yeah, for now.

1151
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:58,039
What've you got?
What if we work backwards?

1152
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,075
What do you mean?
From what? From the directories.

1153
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:03,478
We've been using them to confirm bad Priests.
What if we do it the other way around?

1154
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,981
Use the directories to identify bad Priests.
Yeah, exactly.

1155
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:10,285
We search by designation.
We look for any Priest on "sick leave" or "unassigned."

1156
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,621
Or have been moved around a lot.
Yeah.

1157
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:16,324
It's gonna take a load of work.
Well, not if we're all on it.

1158
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:17,592
You too?

1159
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:20,462
Generally that's what "all" means.
Yeah, generally.

1160
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,451
Library is closing.

1161
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,356
Library is closing.

1162
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,100
Holy shit.

1163
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,016
No freakin' way.

1164
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,126
- Talbot.
- Yep.

1165
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:32,794
- Tivnan.
- Yep.

1166
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:33,862
Toma.
Yep.

1167
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:35,463
Turnbull.
Yep.

1168
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,731
Walsh.
Yep.

1169
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,033
Welsh.
Yep.

1170
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,401
That's it.
That's it.

1171
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:40,869
- Holy shit.
- Robby.

1172
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,204
That's three off Sipe's estimate.
That's incredible.

1173
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:44,706
Robby.

1174
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,141
How many?
Eighty-seven.

1175
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,209
Eighty-seven Priests
in Boston.

1176
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,316
Call Macleish.
I wanna talk to him. Okay.

1177
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,985
Can you print it?
Sure can.

1178
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,289
<i>Jim Sullivan's office.</i>

1179
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,458
Yeah, Walter Robinson
for Jim Sullivan.

1180
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,327
Tell him it's important, please.

1181
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:07,228
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1182
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,335
<i>Hey, Robby.
Everything okay?</i>

1183
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,570
I need you
to tell me something, Jim.

1184
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:18,340
Could it be 90 Priests?
<i>What?</i>

1185
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,675
Could it be as high as 90?

1186
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,177
<i>Jesus, Robby.</i>

1187
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:25,747
I need to know, Jim.
I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important.

1188
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,684
<i>You gotta stop this,
Robby.</i>

1189
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,830
Robby, Macleish's assistant
said he's all booked up. He can't see us.

1190
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:44,099
Yeah. Well, the hell he can't.

1191
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,339
All right.
That'll be fun.

1192
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,878
You know what?
I'll catch up with you, okay?

1193
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,114
Okay.
Hey.

1194
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:01,983
I'm really sorry. I am.
I don't have any time to talk right now...

1195
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,952
Mr. Macleish,
we have reason to believe

1196
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:06,855
that there are allegations
against as many as 87 Priests in Boston.

1197
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,624
I can't talk to you
about that.

1198
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,559
Does that number sound right to you?
You gotta be kidding me.

1199
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,461
I just told you
I don't have time for this crap now.

1200
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:16,464
Eric, how many Priests
did you settle?

1201
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,466
Robby, you know
I can't tell you that.

1202
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:21,870
You're gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims.

1203
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,671
Um...

1204
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:25,140
are you threatening me?

1205
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,308
We've got two stories here.

1206
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,477
We've got a story
about degenerate Clergy,

1207
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,579
and we've got a story
about a bunch of lawyers

1208
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:34,082
turning child abuse
into a cottage industry.

1209
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:37,185
Now, which story
do you want us to write?

1210
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:38,653
'Cause we're writing one of 'em.

1211
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,226
I already sent you
a list of names.

1212
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,929
What are you talking about?
To whom?

1213
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:50,598
The<i> Globe.</i> Years ago.

1214
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,934
After the Porter case,
I got plenty of calls.

1215
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:55,103
I had 20 Priests
in Boston alone,

1216
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,105
but I couldn't go after them
without the press.

1217
01:07:57,107 --> 01:08:00,341
So I sent you guys
a list of names,

1218
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:02,343
and you buried it.

1219
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,649
- I want those names tomorrow.
- Check your goddamn clips, Robby.

1220
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,788
We didn't find anything in the clips.
Yeah. Big surprise.

1221
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:18,860
Richard, uh,
do you still go to Mass?

1222
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:21,629
<i>No. No, I haven't been to church
for some time now.</i>

1223
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,265
<i>But I still consider myself
a catholic.</i>

1224
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,067
H-How does that work?

1225
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:30,305
<i>Well, the church is
an institution, Mike, made of men.</i>

1226
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:32,207
<i>It's passing.</i>

1227
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,943
<i>My faith is in the eternal.</i>

1228
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:37,145
<i>I try to separate the two.</i>

1229
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:39,781
Sounds tricky.
<i>It is.</i>

1230
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:42,984
<i>Especially since the church
continues to go after me.</i>

1231
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:44,953
<i>It takes a toll, Mike.</i>

1232
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:47,055
<i>They'll try to silence anyone
who speaks out.</i>

1233
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:49,624
<i>I'm sure they'll come after you
and your team soon enough.</i>

1234
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,060
Really. And how do you think
they'd do that?

1235
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,265
Hello?

1236
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:58,733
Richard?

1237
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,274
Who is it?

1238
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:08,343
It's the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

1239
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,149
I had dinner at Santarpio's.
Had some leftovers.

1240
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,851
Ah, you're the freakin' best.
Thanks.

1241
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,187
You want a beer?
Yeah.

1242
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,788
You got it.

1243
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:24,425
Jesus. How much longer
you gonna be in this shithole?

1244
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,461
Yeah.
I'm working on it.

1245
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:28,196
She's a good girl, Mike.

1246
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,266
Yeah, she is.
We'll figure it out.

1247
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:33,701
I haven't had
a lot of time lately.

1248
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:35,703
I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.

1249
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:38,039
Have you met this guy
in person yet?

1250
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:41,943
No, but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level.

1251
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:43,611
I'm frickin' starving.

1252
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,649
So, where are we with the 90?

1253
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:49,184
We're close.

1254
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:51,186
How close?
We're close.

1255
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,954
Just answer the question,
will you?

1256
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,393
We got 87 names.

1257
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,562
We're trying to get confirmation.
I think we will.

1258
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,233
Something bugging you?

1259
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:08,069
It's just surprising,
that's all.

1260
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:10,872
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1261
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:12,607
For everybody.

1262
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,048
Wait, Ben.
I forgot to ask you.

1263
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,518
Phil Saviano said he sent a bunch of info
over to the<i> Globe</i> years ago.

1264
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,521
- Do you have any idea to who?
- No. Why?

1265
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:30,491
I'm just curious. I wanted to see if
there's any leads you guys didn't run out.

1266
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:34,028
Saviano was a fucking train wreck five
years ago. We didn't miss anything.

1267
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,964
This story needed Spotlight.

1268
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,500
Yeah, I agree.
I'm just following up.

1269
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,272
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1270
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,446
This is unbelievable.
When did you get this?

1271
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:53,514
Macleish e-mailed
the list this morning.

1272
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:56,217
He settled cases
against 45 Priests.

1273
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:58,620
Where are we on law?

1274
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:00,788
Anything that shows
he had knowledge of this?

1275
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,124
We're still working Garabedian.
But nothing concrete.

1276
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,793
I keep thinking about
that conversation we had the other night

1277
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,563
about how law
called down the power of God

1278
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,632
when we reported on Porter.

1279
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:13,134
That's just law being law.

1280
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:18,573
Okay. But I checked the clips, and, uh,
Porter isn't even in the Boston Archdiocese.

1281
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:23,044
He's from fall river.
So... why the extreme reaction?

1282
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,481
Law had to know.

1283
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,483
That's why he had the reaction.

1284
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:30,551
Because he knew
there were others.

1285
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,556
I think that's the bigger story.

1286
01:11:35,558 --> 01:11:38,559
Wait.
Bigger than 50 Priests?

1287
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:41,329
If it came
from the top down, yes.

1288
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:44,932
But the numbers clearly indicate that there
were Senior Clergy involved.

1289
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,668
That's all they do...
indicate.

1290
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:50,004
Are you telling me that if we run a story
with 50 pedophile Priests in Boston...

1291
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:51,272
Mike.

1292
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:53,841
We'll get into the same catfight
you got into on Porter,

1293
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:57,979
which made a lot of noise
but changed things not one bit.

1294
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,485
We need to focus on the institution,
not the individual Priests.

1295
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,688
Practice and policy.

1296
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,489
Show me the church
manipulated the system

1297
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,792
so that these guys
wouldn't have to face charges.

1298
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:13,027
Show me they put those
same Priests back into parishes

1299
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,662
time and time again.

1300
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:18,499
Show me this was systemic,
that it came from the top down.

1301
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,603
Sounds like
we're going after law.

1302
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:28,543
We're going after
the system.

1303
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:34,148
Make a list of all the victims we have.
Start reaching out.

1304
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,217
And bring Matt in if you need help.
Mm-hmm. Okay.

1305
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:39,053
Hey, when do you go to Springfield?
Our hearing is Monday.

1306
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,321
Okay.

1307
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:42,290
Hey, Robby,
you got a second?

1308
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:44,158
Yeah.

1309
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,529
I, uh... I got one of those treatment
centers a block from my house.

1310
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,033
We got neighbors
with kids.

1311
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:54,068
I know that the work we do
is confidential,

1312
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,739
but I'm feeling like...
I should tell 'em.

1313
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,478
We'll tell 'em soon.

1314
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,481
You sure?

1315
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:08,149
Yeah.
Okay.

1316
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,921
Hi there. I'm Sacha Pfeiffer.
I'm with the<i> Boston Globe.</i>

1317
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:17,258
I'm just looking for a gentleman
by the name of Matthew Walsh.

1318
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,560
Uh, no, he's not.

1319
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:25,566
Right there.
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1320
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,908
Hi.
Hi.

1321
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,443
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from the<i> Boston Globe.</i>

1322
01:13:35,445 --> 01:13:37,845
Yeah, what do you want?
I'd like to speak with Thomas Kennedy.

1323
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:40,715
He doesn't live here anymore.
Do you know where he lives?

1324
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,850
Sir, I'd just like
to ask a few...

1325
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,387
Sacha Pfeiffer,<i> Boston Globe.</i>

1326
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:49,624
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Hi. Thank you.

1327
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:52,794
Anything else you can recall?
No.

1328
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:54,796
No, but I got
a cousin in Quincy.

1329
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:56,697
She saw him in the street
a few years later.

1330
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,133
The bishop
came to the house.

1331
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:01,235
He said nothing like this
had ever happened before.

1332
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:04,772
- He asked us not to press charges.
- And what did your mother do?

1333
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,308
My mother?

1334
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,377
She put out
freakin' cookies.

1335
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,750
There was
a lot of pressure to keep quiet.

1336
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:18,719
From the church?
Yeah, from the church.

1337
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,721
But not just
the church.

1338
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:23,458
From my friends.

1339
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,126
From the other parishioners.

1340
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:28,229
<i>Well, many of
the Priests that I treated</i>

1341
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:29,797
<i>were psychosexually stunted.</i>

1342
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,133
<i>On the emotional level
of a 12- or 13-year-old.</i>

1343
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,734
Jesus.

1344
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:35,670
Sure the chief knew.
Everybody knew.

1345
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,505
But nobody wants
to cuff a Priest.

1346
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:41,409
Mmm. And what about
the prosecutor?

1347
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:45,246
I shouldn't talk about this shit.
I think you should, actually.

1348
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:48,182
Do you know a father Hurley
or a father Gale?

1349
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:49,350
I do.

1350
01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:51,452
I'll beat the shit out of you.
Sorry to bother you.

1351
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:54,294
You leave me alone. You leave my brother alone.
You hear me? Goddamn it.

1352
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,366
Hi there. I'm looking
for Ronald Paquin.

1353
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:07,034
Yes?

1354
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:09,770
You're father Paquin?
Yes. That's right.

1355
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:13,541
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from the<i> Boston Globe. I...</i>

1356
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,376
okay. Could I ask you
a few questions?

1357
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:17,812
Go ahead, dear.

1358
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:20,014
We spoke to several men
who knew you when they were boys

1359
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,316
at St. John the baptist
in Haverhill.

1360
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:25,920
Did... they told us you molested them.
Is that true?

1361
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,458
Mmm, sure,
I fooled around.

1362
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,360
But I never
felt gratified myself.

1363
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,229
Right. Um...

1364
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:38,966
but you admit to molesting boys
at St. John the baptist?

1365
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:43,070
Yes, yes, but as I said,
I never got any pleasure from it.

1366
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:45,373
That's important
to understand.

1367
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,908
Right.

1368
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,843
Um, but can you tell me

1369
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:51,212
where and how you
fooled around with these boys?

1370
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:56,717
I want to be clear.
I never raped anyone.

1371
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,921
There's a difference.
I should know.

1372
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:02,990
- How would you know?
- I<i> was</i> raped.

1373
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,895
I'm sorry. Who raped you?

1374
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,664
Ronny, who are you talking to?
It's okay, Jane.

1375
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:11,165
Father Paquin, who raped you?
Who are you?

1376
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,401
Uh, Sacha Pfeiffer,
from the<i> Globe.</i>

1377
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:15,736
Please get off my porch.
I can speak for myself.

1378
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,672
Get inside the house, Ron.
Mr...

1379
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:19,607
get inside, Ron.
Okay.

1380
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:21,943
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm his sister.

1381
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:24,845
- And I don't want you coming back here.
- Miss Paquin...

1382
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,788
beat you to the end
of the street.

1383
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,790
- No, you won't.
- I beat you last time.

1384
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:38,859
Boy #1 no, you didn't. You cheated.
You did.

1385
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,569
Could you please clarify the<i> Globe's</i>
position for me, Mr. Albano?

1386
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:50,371
Yes, Judge Sweeney.

1387
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,911
Our argument to make
these documents public

1388
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:59,313
rests mainly
on first amendment grounds.

1389
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:02,416
We also have a number of other
relevant arguments.

1390
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,986
After all, your honor,
this was a discretionary order.

1391
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:07,755
Yes. It was made
at the judge's discretion.

1392
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,323
Hey, Mike.

1393
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,325
Hey, Joe.

1394
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:13,961
What's a Spotlight reporter
doing in Springfield?

1395
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,633
Your boy Albano's
sledding uphill.

1396
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,835
You actually think you have a shot
at winning this thing?

1397
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:22,903
You want me
to comment for the<i> Herald?</i>

1398
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:27,775
<i>"Globe</i> reporter
would not comment,

1399
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:30,478
but he did not
seem hopeful."

1400
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,781
He didn't try
and hide it at all.

1401
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:36,684
He had this really
odd rationalization for it,

1402
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:40,354
like it was totally normal
to fool around with little boys.

1403
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:43,290
I'd really like to go back.
I think he'd talk to us.

1404
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,359
Oh, we will.

1405
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,028
Just not yet.

1406
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,530
I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.

1407
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:51,999
Sacha, where'd they send
father Talbot again?

1408
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,268
Um, I think...
wasn't that Cheverus?

1409
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,370
Cheverus.
That's right. Wait.

1410
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,372
Father Talbot from BC High?

1411
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,641
Yeah.
You know him?

1412
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:03,310
Yeah. He was there
when I was.

1413
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:06,781
We have a victim?
Yeah. Lives in Providence.

1414
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,187
There's nothing personal
in these documents, your honor.

1415
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,889
They concern
how the Cardinal is handling...

1416
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:17,358
say "The Archdiocese."

1417
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,826
Excuse me?

1418
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:22,063
You don't get to tag
the Cardinal with everything, Mr. Albano.

1419
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:24,532
Say "The Archdiocese."

1420
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:28,069
Judge Sweeney, the<i> Globe</i> is not a party to
this case. They just want to sell papers.

1421
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:31,572
If Mr. Garabedian had not smeared
the Cardinal's good name,

1422
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,140
we wouldn't
even be here.

1423
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:35,910
Your honor, I object to the use
of the word "smear."

1424
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:38,646
- Duly noted, Mr. Garabedian.
- Thank you, your honor.

1425
01:18:38,648 --> 01:18:40,981
- Anything else, Mr. Rogers?
- No, your honor.

1426
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:42,750
Mr. Albano,
you may continue.

1427
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,251
The<i> Globe</i>
believes having...

1428
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:48,823
hey, Mitch, how you doing?

1429
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,891
I'm fine.

1430
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,761
He's tough,
that Wilson Rogers.

1431
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:56,831
He's smug.
And he's sloppy.

1432
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,266
He doesn't seem sloppy.

1433
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:02,403
You don't know the half of it.
Trust me.

1434
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,004
What's the half of it?

1435
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,342
Tell me the half of it,
Mitch.

1436
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:12,012
Off the record?
Off the record, yeah.

1437
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,885
Three years ago,
I get a call from an ex-Priest.

1438
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:19,286
Anthony Benzevich.

1439
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:21,689
He was at blessed sacrament
back in '62,

1440
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:23,424
and he saw Geoghan...

1441
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,428
Taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, okay?

1442
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:31,298
So he's appalled, all right?
Tells the bishop about it.

1443
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,136
And the bishop threatens
to reassign him to South America.

1444
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:36,804
Jesus.
Yeah, all right.

1445
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:39,140
So fast-forward 35 years,
Benzevich reads

1446
01:19:39,142 --> 01:19:42,243
that Geoghan has been charged
with molesting hundreds of kids.

1447
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:44,311
All right? So he feels guilty.
He calls me.

1448
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:46,547
So you have testimony
of a Priest

1449
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,983
telling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?

1450
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:51,252
No, I do not.

1451
01:19:51,254 --> 01:19:53,888
Because when I called
Benzevich in to give a deposition,

1452
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,990
he comes in
with a lawyer.

1453
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:58,125
Wilson Rogers.
Right.

1454
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,795
And suddenly father Benzevich
has a very foggy memory.

1455
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,997
Can't remember anything.
He's useless.

1456
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:06,066
So I go back to work.
I forget about it. Whatever.

1457
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:08,135
Until about a year ago,
I find an article

1458
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,272
about a Priest who warned
church officials about Geoghan.

1459
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:13,641
Benzevich went to the press?
Yeah.

1460
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:16,443
Yeah. Local paper, <i>Patriot Ledger.</i>
Nobody saw it.

1461
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:18,345
But now I got Benzevich
on record.

1462
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:22,449
So I file a motion to depose Benzevich
a second time. All right?

1463
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:25,486
And Wilson Rogers,
that smug son of a bitch,

1464
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:28,689
he files a motion
opposing my motion.

1465
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:30,324
And that's when I have him.

1466
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:32,827
Have... have him how?

1467
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:36,430
Rogers opposes my motion,
so I have to make an argument

1468
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:39,500
as to why I'm allowed to depose
father Benzevich a second time, okay?

1469
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,703
But this time,
I'm allowed to attach exhibits.

1470
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:44,305
Do you follow
what I'm saying?

1471
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:45,873
The sealed documents?
Yes.

1472
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,108
I can attach
the sealed documents

1473
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,377
that I've gotten in discovery,
Mr. Rezendes,

1474
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:54,048
the same documents that your paper
is currently suing for.

1475
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,482
You're shitting me.

1476
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:57,785
What? No.
No, I'm not shitting you.

1477
01:20:57,787 --> 01:21:00,221
So I pull out
the 14 most damning docs

1478
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:02,056
and I attach them
to my motion.

1479
01:21:02,058 --> 01:21:04,058
And they prove everything.
Everything.

1480
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,627
About the church,
about the bishops, about law.

1481
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,395
And it's all public?

1482
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:10,664
Because your motion
to oppose Roger's motion...

1483
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:11,632
is public.

1484
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:14,568
Yeah. Exactly.
Now you're paying attention.

1485
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,571
So I could just walk into that courthouse
right now and get those documents?

1486
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:21,342
No, you cannot, because the documents
are not there.

1487
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:23,244
But you just said
they're public.

1488
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:26,413
I know I did.
But this is Boston.

1489
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,083
And the church
does not want them to be found.

1490
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:32,086
So they are not there.

1491
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,357
Mitch, are you telling me
that the catholic church

1492
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:38,592
removed legal documents
from that courthouse?

1493
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:42,029
Look, I'm not crazy.
I'm not paranoid.

1494
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:43,764
I'm experienced.

1495
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:46,600
Check the docket.
You'll see.

1496
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,335
They control everything.

1497
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:52,573
Everything.

1498
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,277
I gotta go back in.

1499
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,082
I just got
the fucking documents.

1500
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,466
Docket entry number 49,
in the Geoghan case.

1501
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,635
Okay, thanks.
We close in 10 minutes.

1502
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:23,170
Ten minutes? All right.

1503
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:01,775
Robby.
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1504
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:03,344
Hey.
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

1505
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,412
Garabedian gave me a tip.

1506
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:09,016
Some of the sealed docs are already public.
They're part of a motion he filed.

1507
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:10,517
<i>He said they're
the best of the bunch.</i>

1508
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:12,519
<i>We don't have to wait
for Sweeney's ruling.</i>

1509
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:15,089
So we can get them?
<i>Yeah, but they're not there.</i>

1510
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:18,425
Already talked to Albano.
He said all we have to do is file a motion,

1511
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:20,995
and Sweeney will order Mitch
to refile the docs.

1512
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,763
And you think
these documents are...

1513
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,699
<i>he said these 14 docs are all we need.
They're huge.</i>

1514
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,368
Okay.

1515
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:30,237
I'll call Ben. Good work.

1516
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,122
<i>Is this purely an accident</i>

1517
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:49,857
<i>or could this have been
an intentional act?</i>

1518
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:53,560
<i>Either way, extensive damage
has been done to this building.</i>

1519
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,164
What happened?

1520
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:00,734
They're saying it's a prop plane,
but that's not a prop plane.

1521
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,641
Tell Linda to get every reporter
we have in here now.

1522
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,744
<i>You pray for the victims.</i>

1523
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,747
<i>You pray for the injured.</i>

1524
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:16,817
<i>And you pray
for those who survived.</i>

1525
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,888
<i>You pray, too, for the nation.</i>

1526
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:24,425
<i>That our response to this</i>

1527
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:29,363
<i>might reflect
the best ideals of our nation.</i>

1528
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:32,766
<i>And even more,
reflect God's own teaching,</i>

1529
01:24:32,768 --> 01:24:37,104
<i>not only as it's shown
in Christianity and Judaism</i>

1530
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:39,373
<i>but in Islam as well.</i>

1531
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:42,109
Not bad.
Who's there? Paulson.

1532
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:44,111
I wanna talk to him
when he's back.

1533
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:45,913
Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?

1534
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:49,183
They just opened the airport in Providence.
He's on his way there now.

1535
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:51,251
Ben, I'm gonna need
more people on massport.

1536
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,886
I'll give you
three of my guys.

1537
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:54,922
Robby, put your team on that too.
Got it.

1538
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,925
- And, Robby, everything else stops.
- Understood.

1539
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,426
Why is Mike
going to Florida?

1540
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,962
Flight school.
It's where they learned to fly.

1541
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:05,032
Robby, I've got a lot of victim interviews
set up this week.

1542
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,533
You're gonna
have to cancel 'em.

1543
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:08,802
That's gonna be hard.
I know. This is nuts.

1544
01:25:08,804 --> 01:25:12,039
Two days ago I told my wife we gotta be
working the biggest story on the planet.

1545
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,474
<i>Boston Globe.</i>

1546
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:15,642
<i>Boston Globe.</i>
One Moment, please.

1547
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,711
Yes, if you have a tip,
I will transfer you down to Metro.

1548
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,747
Mitchell Garabedian.

1549
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:22,649
<i>Mitch, it's Mike.
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

1550
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:24,451
I don't have time to talk
to you, Mr. Rezendes.

1551
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,154
Hey, just quickly.
Did you refile those docs yet?

1552
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:29,256
<i>No. I just got the order.
It takes time.</i>

1553
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:31,658
Okay, great. Can you hold off
on refiling them? <i>Hold off?</i>

1554
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,328
I have to go to Florida.
Once you refile they're public.

1555
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,330
Other newspapers will be able
to get a hold of 'em.

1556
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:38,398
<i>Other newspapers
are not my concern.</i>

1557
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,334
<i>I received a judicial order.</i>

1558
01:25:40,336 --> 01:25:42,336
<i>I told you the church
is watching me.</i>

1559
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:45,305
Hey, Mitch, please.
All I need is a few more weeks.

1560
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,475
<i>I can't make any promises.
Good-bye.</i>

1561
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:51,245
Mitch! Mitch! Shit!

1562
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,981
Shit.

1563
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,024
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

1564
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:07,194
No one wants to read about kids
getting raped by Priests, especially now.

1565
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:08,762
But you asked
a lot of people

1566
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:11,532
to relive some very painful experiences,
and you just disappear.

1567
01:26:11,534 --> 01:26:13,433
Phil, you know why
we were taken off of this story.

1568
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:14,868
It's been six weeks
since 9/11.

1569
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,204
I realize that,
and we're gonna get back to it.

1570
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:18,705
When?

1571
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,509
You're doing the same thing
you guys did last time. No.

1572
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,877
You're dropping us.
No.

1573
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:26,713
Maybe I should tell
the<i> Herald</i> that story.

1574
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:29,550
Okay, Phil,
you go ahead and do that.

1575
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:32,853
It'll undo all the work we've done,
but I can't stop you.

1576
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:38,859
Listen to me.
I am here because I care.

1577
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:42,462
We're not going away.

1578
01:26:42,464 --> 01:26:44,831
We're gonna tell this story.
We're gonna tell it right.

1579
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,568
We just need a little more time.
That's all we're asking for.

1580
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:52,573
Why bother asking?

1581
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,410
You're gonna do
what you want anyway.

1582
01:26:56,412 --> 01:26:58,245
You always do.

1583
01:26:58,247 --> 01:26:59,813
Phil.

1584
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,249
Phil!

1585
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:10,591
Hey.
<i>How's south beach?</i>

1586
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:13,360
Boynton beach.
Remarkably different place.

1587
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:14,928
What's up?

1588
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,097
<i>Mitch Garabedian
called me today.</i>

1589
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:19,700
Why'd he call you?
<i>'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.</i>

1590
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:22,603
<i>He refiled the docs.</i>
What?

1591
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,438
Robby, those docs
are public now.

1592
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,407
<i>We gotta get there before anyone else does.</i>
I know. I know. I know.

1593
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:30,510
Just wrap up whatever you're doing
and get the first flight out.

1594
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:32,713
<i>I'll book a flight now and go straight
to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>

1595
01:27:32,715 --> 01:27:34,781
All right. Call me when you get in.
<i>Okay.</i>

1596
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,853
Robby, I'd like to let Phil Saviano know
that we're back on it.

1597
01:27:39,855 --> 01:27:41,622
Good idea.

1598
01:27:41,624 --> 01:27:44,891
Go have dinner with Hansi.
Might be the last time for a while.

1599
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,493
Mm-hmm.

1600
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,933
Robby,
after we saw Macleish,

1601
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:54,968
I started going back
through the clips.

1602
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,137
And I had a little time
last week finally.

1603
01:27:57,139 --> 01:28:00,007
So, um, I found that.

1604
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:02,876
It's from '93.

1605
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,821
That it?

1606
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,792
Yeah.
Yeah, that's... that's it.

1607
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:21,962
Good night.

1608
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,898
Okay. Good night.

1609
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,538
Hello.

1610
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,673
So, I was probably
a few years after you, right?

1611
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,376
No, you were more than a few.

1612
01:29:09,378 --> 01:29:10,977
Believe me.

1613
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,647
Well, after BC High,
I came down to Providence

1614
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:15,549
and played hockey
for the Friars.

1615
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:18,552
Oh, well, you must
have been pretty good.

1616
01:29:18,554 --> 01:29:21,154
No. Rode the bench
in college. Yeah.

1617
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:22,689
But I loved the city.

1618
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:24,858
Uh-huh. And we just had
our third kid.

1619
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,294
And I still get my<i> Globe,</i>
for the record.

1620
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,564
Ah, that's good to know.
Good to know.

1621
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:35,535
Look, Kevin, uh,
that's actually why I'm here.

1622
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,838
Yeah?
I...

1623
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,607
I need to ask you some questions
about father Talbot.

1624
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,583
How'd you find out?

1625
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,719
Well...
um...

1626
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:54,821
I guess
it doesn't matter.

1627
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:02,829
Hell, I never even
told my wife.

1628
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:06,566
Excuse me.

1629
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:13,206
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I need to get in there.

1630
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,875
We're closed. Come on. Let me in.
Five minutes.

1631
01:30:14,877 --> 01:30:18,512
- I'm sorry. We're closed.
- Come on. Five minutes.

1632
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,995
Here. There.

1633
01:30:37,465 --> 01:30:39,933
This is the Geoghan case?
That's right.

1634
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,869
- Those records are sealed.
- No. That's a public motion.

1635
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:44,704
Those records are public.

1636
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:47,941
- Look, I work for the<i> Globe.</i>
- Good for you.

1637
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:53,213
Can I talk to your supervisor?
He's not in today.

1638
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:57,083
What about a judge? There must be judges
that work on this kind of thing.

1639
01:30:57,085 --> 01:30:58,885
Sixth floor.

1640
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:08,829
We understand the nature
of the allegations against father Talbot.

1641
01:31:08,831 --> 01:31:12,966
I'm just not sure what you want
from President Kemeza.

1642
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,168
Talbot taught here
long before Bill took over.

1643
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,736
Mmm. Of course.

1644
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:18,839
We just want to know
if it's possible

1645
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:20,907
that the president,
the faculty, the board,

1646
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:22,809
that no one knew
what was going on at the time.

1647
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,978
I graduated in 1979,

1648
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,080
and I had no idea
about any of this.

1649
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:29,115
So if you're suggesting
that father Gibbons

1650
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:31,351
and father Callahan
had in any way...

1651
01:31:31,353 --> 01:31:32,953
Gibbons and Callahan.

1652
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:35,522
I mean, they ran this place
like the Navy.

1653
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,157
You really think
they didn't know?

1654
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:41,094
It's a big school, Robby.
You know that.

1655
01:31:41,096 --> 01:31:45,332
And then we're talking about seven
alleged victims over, what, eight years?

1656
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:48,835
No, we're talking about,
you know, seven that we know about.

1657
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,037
This is ridiculous.

1658
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:53,373
You're reaching for a story here...
Jack. Jack.

1659
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:57,711
Jack. If I had been president then,
I would've known.

1660
01:31:57,713 --> 01:32:00,313
Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.

1661
01:32:00,315 --> 01:32:03,650
Why do you think
they sent Talbot up to Cheverus?

1662
01:32:03,652 --> 01:32:06,119
You know they wanted him
out of town.

1663
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,855
Robby,

1664
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:11,157
as well intentioned
as Bill's remarks are,

1665
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:14,761
I'm hoping we can keep this between
us until we all get on the same page.

1666
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:21,067
Is that why we're here,
to get on the same page?

1667
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:24,237
No, we're here because you're an
important alumnus, Robby, and a friend.

1668
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:28,375
Exactly. And we know you care about
this school as much as we do.

1669
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:31,578
Did you play a sport here, Jack?

1670
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:34,214
Yeah. Football. Why?

1671
01:32:34,216 --> 01:32:35,982
Mmm. I ran track.

1672
01:32:35,984 --> 01:32:38,084
You know,
I went to Providence yesterday

1673
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:40,387
to talk to one
of father Talbot's victims.

1674
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:44,391
He played hockey here.
And he's one of the better ones.

1675
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:47,994
He's got a wife, kids, good job.

1676
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:52,666
About 10 minutes
into the conversation,

1677
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:54,167
the guy breaks down.

1678
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:56,403
You know,
couldn't stop crying.

1679
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:01,841
Said he could never figure out
why father Talbot picked him.

1680
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:06,446
Father Talbot
coached the hockey team.

1681
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,950
So...

1682
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:13,453
I guess we just got lucky.

1683
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:15,155
You and me.

1684
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,065
Does Jack Dunn work for the school?
No, he's PR for Boston college.

1685
01:33:25,067 --> 01:33:27,067
They call him
when they need help.

1686
01:33:27,069 --> 01:33:29,135
And Pete Conley,
why was he there?

1687
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:31,271
Good question.
Pete's a big alum.

1688
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,974
But I called Bill directly
and I asked for a sit-down.

1689
01:33:33,976 --> 01:33:36,109
I never mentioned
anybody else.

1690
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:39,713
It's like everybody
already knows the story.

1691
01:33:39,715 --> 01:33:43,183
Yeah. Except us.
And we work right there.

1692
01:33:46,722 --> 01:33:48,455
Judge Volterra?
Yes?

1693
01:33:48,457 --> 01:33:50,790
Hi. I'm Mike Rezendes
from the<i> Boston Globe.</i>

1694
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:54,494
I'm having some trouble accessing some
public records down in the records room.

1695
01:33:54,496 --> 01:33:57,263
I was wondering
if I could have a word with you?

1696
01:33:57,265 --> 01:33:59,199
All right.
Thank you.

1697
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,469
Thank you very much.

1698
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:08,475
These exhibits you're after,
Mr. Rezendes,

1699
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:11,011
they're very sensitive records.

1700
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:14,014
With all due respect, your honor,
that's not the question.

1701
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,749
The records are public.

1702
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:19,285
Maybe so, but tell me,

1703
01:34:19,287 --> 01:34:21,354
where's the editorial
responsibility

1704
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:23,523
in publishing records
of this nature?

1705
01:34:23,525 --> 01:34:27,360
Well, where's the editorial responsibility
in<i> not</i> publishing them?

1706
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:40,306
You can't take those.
You need to make copies.

1707
01:34:40,308 --> 01:34:43,443
I'm going to the copy room.
It closed at 4:00.

1708
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:49,949
Look, I'll give you...

1709
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:54,387
83 bucks
to use yours.

1710
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:02,228
Hey! Cabbie!

1711
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:05,532
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1712
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,837
Take me to the<i> Boston Globe</i>
on Morrissey Boulevard.

1713
01:35:10,839 --> 01:35:14,274
Don't take 93.
Take Dorchester Avenue.

1714
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:17,844
<i>Robby, it's incredible.</i>

1715
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:20,547
<i>Law knew about Geoghan
for years, no question.</i>

1716
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:23,750
<i>There's a letter to law
from a woman, Margaret Gallant,</i>

1717
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:26,753
<i>who lived in Jamaica plain
in the early '80 when Geoghan was there.</i>

1718
01:35:26,755 --> 01:35:28,254
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1719
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,423
<i>"Our family is rooted
in the church.</i>

1720
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:33,159
<i>Our desire is to protect
the Holy orders</i>

1721
01:35:33,161 --> 01:35:35,528
<i>even in the midst of our agony</i>

1722
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:38,865
<i>over the seven boys
in our family who have been violated."</i>

1723
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:41,334
<i>Seven, Robby. Seven boys.</i>

1724
01:35:41,336 --> 01:35:44,437
<i>"It was suggested
we keep silent.</i>

1725
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:47,941
<i>We did not question the authority of
the church two years ago.</i>

1726
01:35:47,943 --> 01:35:50,944
<i>But since father Geoghan
is still in his parish... "</i>

1727
01:35:50,946 --> 01:35:54,681
<i>but she sent it to law
and law did shit.</i>

1728
01:35:54,683 --> 01:35:58,251
<i>Here's another one to law,
same year. Listen to this.</i>

1729
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,920
<i>"A word on the recent assignment
of father Geoghan...</i>

1730
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:04,023
<i>As an associate
at St. Julia's in Weston.</i>

1731
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:07,961
<i>Father Geoghan has a history
of homosexual involvement with young boys.</i>

1732
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:10,597
<i>I understand his recent departure
from St. Brendan's</i>

1733
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:12,599
<i>may be related
to this problem.</i>

1734
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:15,902
I wonder if father Geoghan
should not be reduced to just weekend work

1735
01:36:15,904 --> 01:36:17,804
while receiving
some kind of therapy.

1736
01:36:17,806 --> 01:36:20,807
You know how grateful I am to you
for your constant concern.

1737
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:22,542
Sincerely yours
in our lord,

1738
01:36:22,544 --> 01:36:26,312
most reverend John M D'Arcy,
auxiliary bishop of Boston.

1739
01:36:26,314 --> 01:36:27,947
December 7, 1984."

1740
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:29,616
An auxiliary bishop
wrote that?

1741
01:36:29,618 --> 01:36:31,284
That's incredible.

1742
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:34,254
He broke ranks.
I mean, when did Gallant write her letter?

1743
01:36:34,256 --> 01:36:36,422
1984.
And law just ignored it.

1744
01:36:36,424 --> 01:36:38,725
How do you ignore
that freakin' letter?

1745
01:36:38,727 --> 01:36:40,326
We got 'em.

1746
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:43,263
You can't read these letters
and think anything else. It's proof.

1747
01:36:43,265 --> 01:36:45,632
Yeah, it is.

1748
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:47,934
This is good work.

1749
01:36:47,936 --> 01:36:50,069
Should we take it
up to Ben?

1750
01:36:50,071 --> 01:36:53,072
Uh, no. Not yet.

1751
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:56,676
Why not?
We got law. This is it.

1752
01:36:56,678 --> 01:37:00,413
No, this is law covering for one Priest.
There's another 90 out there.

1753
01:37:00,415 --> 01:37:03,783
Yeah, we'll print that story when
we get it, but we gotta go with this now.

1754
01:37:03,785 --> 01:37:07,187
I'm not gonna rush this story, Mike.
We don't have a choice, Robby.

1755
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:09,355
If we don't rush to print,

1756
01:37:09,357 --> 01:37:11,791
somebody else is going to find
these letters and butcher the story.

1757
01:37:11,793 --> 01:37:14,761
Joe Quimby from the<i> Herald</i>
was at the freaking courthouse.

1758
01:37:14,763 --> 01:37:18,298
So we'll write a holding story
and we'll keep our eye on the<i> Herald.</i>

1759
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,200
Keep our eye
on the<i> Herald?</i>

1760
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:22,202
They run this and get it wrong,
the church will bury it.

1761
01:37:22,204 --> 01:37:24,003
- We gotta do this now.
- Mike, Mike.

1762
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,339
What? Why are we hesitating?

1763
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,708
Baron told us to get law.
This is law.

1764
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:30,710
Baron told us
to get the system.

1765
01:37:30,712 --> 01:37:34,380
We need the full scope. That's the only
thing that will put an end to this.

1766
01:37:34,382 --> 01:37:36,349
Then let's take it to Ben,
let him decide.

1767
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,218
We'll take it to Ben
when I say it's time.

1768
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:42,222
It's time, Robby! It's time!

1769
01:37:42,224 --> 01:37:46,226
They knew and they
let it happen. To kids!

1770
01:37:46,228 --> 01:37:49,229
Okay? It could've been you.
It could've been me.

1771
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:51,731
It could've been any of us.

1772
01:37:51,733 --> 01:37:53,566
We gotta nail these scumbags.

1773
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:56,703
We gotta show people that nobody
can get away with this.

1774
01:37:56,705 --> 01:38:00,406
Not a Priest or a Cardinal
or a freaking Pope!

1775
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,911
You finished?

1776
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:08,214
Yeah, I am.
This is bullshit.

1777
01:38:36,845 --> 01:38:38,678
You okay?

1778
01:38:41,181 --> 01:38:43,616
Mmm.

1779
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:50,256
Hey, Hansi.

1780
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:53,359
Hard day at work, Mike?

1781
01:38:57,631 --> 01:38:59,565
Here.
Thank you.

1782
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:02,402
I-I-I-I don't know
why I got so pissed off.

1783
01:39:02,404 --> 01:39:04,070
You know,
I think Robby's wrong.

1784
01:39:04,072 --> 01:39:08,041
You know, you're just...
you care about the story, Mike. We all do.

1785
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:12,478
Yeah, I guess.
Hmm.

1786
01:39:14,648 --> 01:39:17,383
I stopped going to church
with my Nana.

1787
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:20,820
It was...
it was too hard. I...

1788
01:39:20,822 --> 01:39:22,989
you know,
I'd be sitting there,

1789
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:26,292
and I would start thinking about
Joe Crowley or someone else,

1790
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:29,996
and I just...
I just got so angry.

1791
01:39:29,998 --> 01:39:32,565
Did you...
did you tell her why?

1792
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,202
She goes to church
three times a week, Mike.

1793
01:39:41,076 --> 01:39:43,343
It really pisses me off.

1794
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:47,513
You know,

1795
01:39:47,515 --> 01:39:51,017
I actually really liked
going to church when I was a little kid.

1796
01:39:51,019 --> 01:39:52,852
Mmm.

1797
01:39:52,854 --> 01:39:55,822
Why'd you stop?
Typical shit.

1798
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:59,425
But the weird thing is is...

1799
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:05,198
I think i...

1800
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,267
I think I figured that
maybe one day I w... I w...

1801
01:40:08,269 --> 01:40:12,438
I would actually go back.

1802
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,608
I was really...
I was holding on to that.

1803
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:17,176
Mm-hmm.

1804
01:40:18,379 --> 01:40:21,948
I read those letters,
and it...

1805
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:26,219
and something just... cracked.

1806
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:29,389
It's a shitty feeling.
Yeah.

1807
01:40:30,724 --> 01:40:32,725
It's a shitty feeling.

1808
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:38,698
Looks like a long day.
Hey, Pete.

1809
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,967
I'm sorry to make it longer.

1810
01:40:40,969 --> 01:40:42,201
Brian.

1811
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,738
Has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete?

1812
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:48,207
Well, sure.

1813
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:50,743
But the trick
is to keep asking.

1814
01:40:50,745 --> 01:40:52,812
For Boston.
Boston.

1815
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:55,648
Mmm.

1816
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:58,985
So, um, you here
for the Cardinal?

1817
01:40:58,987 --> 01:41:00,586
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1818
01:41:00,588 --> 01:41:04,390
I wouldn't... I wouldn't presume
to speak for the Cardinal, no.

1819
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:09,562
You know, you got a lot of people here
who respect you, Robby.

1820
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:12,165
Oh, well...
the work you do.

1821
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:15,668
That's good to know.
It's 'cause you care about this place.

1822
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:18,838
It's why you do what you do.
It's who you are.

1823
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:24,210
You know, but people need the church,
more than ever right now.

1824
01:41:24,212 --> 01:41:26,412
You know, you can feel it.

1825
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:28,514
And the Cardinal, uh...

1826
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:33,052
you know, the Cardinal,
he might not be perfect.

1827
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:36,456
But we can't throw out all the good
e's doing over a few bad apples.

1828
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:42,295
Now, you know, I'm bringing this up to
you because I know this is Baron's idea.

1829
01:41:42,297 --> 01:41:44,063
His agenda.

1830
01:41:44,065 --> 01:41:45,965
I gotta tell ya,
I mean, honest to God,

1831
01:41:45,967 --> 01:41:49,302
I mean, he doesn't care
about the city the way we do.

1832
01:41:49,304 --> 01:41:51,504
I mean, how could he?

1833
01:41:57,478 --> 01:41:59,612
This is how it happens,
isn't it, Pete?

1834
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:00,980
What's that?

1835
01:42:00,982 --> 01:42:02,782
A guy leans on a guy,

1836
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:06,452
and suddenly the whole town
just looks the other way.

1837
01:42:07,988 --> 01:42:11,390
Robby. Robby. Lookit.

1838
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,595
Marty Baron is just trying
to make his mark.

1839
01:42:15,597 --> 01:42:18,264
He's gonna be here for a couple
of years and he's gonna move on.

1840
01:42:18,266 --> 01:42:21,234
Just like he did
in New York and Miami.

1841
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,570
Where are you gonna go?

1842
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:27,807
Hmm?

1843
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:31,911
Good night, Robby. Brian.

1844
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:35,615
Hey, uh, Pete.
Yeah?

1845
01:42:35,617 --> 01:42:39,418
Uh, when we do run the story,

1846
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,988
uh, I'm gonna need a comment
from the Cardinal.

1847
01:42:44,191 --> 01:42:46,859
We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.

1848
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:48,828
Night, Pete.

1849
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:00,039
Robby.

1850
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,209
What?

1851
01:43:03,211 --> 01:43:05,578
No shit. When?

1852
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:09,782
Okay. Yeah.

1853
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:14,887
Hey.

1854
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:16,455
What's up?

1855
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:19,625
Sweeney ruled
in our favor.

1856
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:21,861
She ruled
to unseal the documents.

1857
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:25,765
Geez.
Huh.

1858
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:30,069
The church has already
filed an appeal.

1859
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:33,239
But the trial court ruling
is generally upheld in these matters.

1860
01:43:33,241 --> 01:43:35,708
And when would we get
the documents?

1861
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:38,644
Probably takes Cohen
a few weeks to rule.

1862
01:43:38,646 --> 01:43:40,746
Then there's
a redaction process.

1863
01:43:40,748 --> 01:43:44,817
Uh, I'd say they'd be
made public mid-January.

1864
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:46,252
Okay.
All right.

1865
01:43:46,254 --> 01:43:47,420
Thanks, John.
You bet.

1866
01:43:47,422 --> 01:43:48,688
Nice work.
Thanks.

1867
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:51,257
Metro should
run something, Marty.

1868
01:43:51,259 --> 01:43:52,925
We can't
run this one big.

1869
01:43:52,927 --> 01:43:56,562
Why wouldn't we?
It's a major first amendment victory.

1870
01:43:56,564 --> 01:44:00,266
Not to mention, you get an Irish Catholic
judge ruling against the church?

1871
01:44:00,268 --> 01:44:02,768
That's a hell of a precedent.
Mm-hmm.

1872
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:05,104
We don't want the<i> Herald</i>
going deep on this.

1873
01:44:05,106 --> 01:44:06,973
Why's that?

1874
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:11,110
You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.

1875
01:44:11,112 --> 01:44:12,812
I'm not stepping out.

1876
01:44:21,054 --> 01:44:22,088
Peter.

1877
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,938
When did you, uh...
a couple of weeks ago.

1878
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,640
A couple of weeks?

1879
01:44:40,642 --> 01:44:42,308
- Yeah.
- And you're telling us now?

1880
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:44,977
These are substantial.

1881
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:47,413
They clearly show
that law was negligent.

1882
01:44:47,415 --> 01:44:49,248
I need more time.

1883
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,317
- I wanna keep digging.
- For what?

1884
01:44:51,319 --> 01:44:53,653
This is the goddamn story.
It's not the whole story.

1885
01:44:53,655 --> 01:44:55,454
Tough shit.
We're on a clock now.

1886
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:57,223
Even if we don't run
Sweeney's ruling,

1887
01:44:57,225 --> 01:44:59,458
another paper could find these letters
and fuck the story.

1888
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,661
Agreed. But we run
these letters alone,

1889
01:45:01,663 --> 01:45:04,964
law apologizes, says it's a one-time thing.
He can bury it.

1890
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:08,467
How? These clearly show he knew
and did nothing about it.

1891
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:11,671
Look, I'm close to stories
on 70 Priests.

1892
01:45:11,673 --> 01:45:14,507
We nail that,
along with those letters,

1893
01:45:14,509 --> 01:45:18,010
this is proof
that this is bigger than law.

1894
01:45:18,012 --> 01:45:20,613
It's the whole system.

1895
01:45:20,615 --> 01:45:23,082
You have multiple sources
confirming all those Priests?

1896
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:26,686
- On some. I can get more.
- Too risky.

1897
01:45:26,688 --> 01:45:30,089
If we're not buttoned up on every single
one of them, the church will pick us apart.

1898
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:34,527
I think I can get us someone
from the other side of the aisle.

1899
01:45:34,529 --> 01:45:37,363
Somebody inside the church?

1900
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:39,198
Yeah. A lawyer.

1901
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,300
Will he go on the record?

1902
01:45:41,302 --> 01:45:43,769
Deep background.
But he's a solid source.

1903
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:49,709
Rezendes needs time
to write the story.

1904
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:52,611
We don't want to drop it
at Christmas, not after 9/11.

1905
01:45:53,547 --> 01:45:55,648
We could run it
just after new year's,

1906
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:58,517
before they release
the rest of the documents.

1907
01:46:01,888 --> 01:46:03,823
All right.

1908
01:46:03,825 --> 01:46:06,926
Tell Canellos
to bury the ruling in Metro.

1909
01:46:08,395 --> 01:46:10,363
You got six weeks.

1910
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:12,732
Thank you.

1911
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:15,067
Tell Mike
I want a draft by Christmas.

1912
01:46:15,069 --> 01:46:17,203
And we need a response
from Lake Street.

1913
01:46:17,205 --> 01:46:19,405
Who does PR for the Cardinal?
Still John Walsh?

1914
01:46:19,407 --> 01:46:23,008
No, somebody new. Donna Morrissey.
She came from TV. She's young.

1915
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:25,845
Good. Get a quote. We need something
from law to appear evenhanded.

1916
01:46:25,847 --> 01:46:28,314
Robby, next time give me
a goddamn heads-up.

1917
01:46:28,316 --> 01:46:30,516
Will do.

1918
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:55,668
Robby, what a nice surprise.

1919
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:57,236
Come on in.

1920
01:48:03,478 --> 01:48:07,012
Hey, hon,
look who I found outside.

1921
01:48:09,616 --> 01:48:11,984
Karen, can you
give us a minute?

1922
01:48:13,019 --> 01:48:16,155
Sure.
Good to see you, Karen.

1923
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:20,926
What's up?

1924
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:38,210
I'm out of time, Jim.

1925
01:48:38,212 --> 01:48:41,547
We've got cover-up stories
on 70 Priests.

1926
01:48:41,549 --> 01:48:45,951
But the boss isn't gonna run it
unless I get confirmation from your side.

1927
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:49,855
Are you out of your mind?

1928
01:48:49,857 --> 01:48:52,491
Come on.
This is our town, Jimmy.

1929
01:48:52,493 --> 01:48:57,563
Everybody knew something was going on,
and no one did a thing.

1930
01:48:57,565 --> 01:49:01,500
- We gotta put an end to it.
- Don't tell me what I gotta do.

1931
01:49:01,502 --> 01:49:04,670
Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags,
but that's my job, Robby.

1932
01:49:04,672 --> 01:49:07,106
I was doing my job.

1933
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:10,242
Yeah.

1934
01:49:10,244 --> 01:49:11,977
You and everyone else.

1935
01:49:20,587 --> 01:49:22,321
Get out of my house.

1936
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:34,833
Hey!

1937
01:49:36,269 --> 01:49:39,004
You come to my home
and lay this shit on me?

1938
01:49:39,906 --> 01:49:42,174
You were right, Robby.

1939
01:49:42,176 --> 01:49:45,110
We all knew
something was going on.

1940
01:49:45,112 --> 01:49:49,348
So where were you?
What took you so long?

1941
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:57,289
I don't know, Jim.

1942
01:50:02,462 --> 01:50:04,863
Give me the list.

1943
01:50:59,853 --> 01:51:02,254
Larry, we're going to press
in six hours.

1944
01:51:02,256 --> 01:51:04,523
Donna Morrissey said she'd call us
with a quote from law hours ago.

1945
01:51:04,525 --> 01:51:06,992
That's what I thought.
When did you talk to her?

1946
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:09,194
Okay. Okay, Larry.
Yeah.

1947
01:51:09,196 --> 01:51:12,531
Yeah. Yeah, that's good
to know. Thanks, Pete.

1948
01:51:12,533 --> 01:51:14,299
Anything?

1949
01:51:14,301 --> 01:51:16,935
Conley said Donna Morrissey should've called.
He just left lake street.

1950
01:51:16,937 --> 01:51:18,837
Yeah, Rasky said
the same thing.

1951
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:21,140
This is ridiculous.
You'd think they want to get ahead of this.

1952
01:51:21,142 --> 01:51:23,275
I mean,
they'd be idiots not to.

1953
01:51:23,277 --> 01:51:26,478
I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing.

1954
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:29,014
Sunday's the feast
of the Epiphany.

1955
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:31,850
That seems appropriate.

1956
01:51:36,623 --> 01:51:38,223
Mike Rezendes.

1957
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:41,393
Hey, Donna.

1958
01:51:41,395 --> 01:51:44,797
Thanks for calling. Yeah, I just had a few
questions if you have a minute.

1959
01:51:47,133 --> 01:51:48,267
What?

1960
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:52,237
What?
Another adjective.

1961
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:55,741
Anything?
Law just turned us down.

1962
01:51:55,743 --> 01:51:57,342
Jesus Christ.

1963
01:51:57,344 --> 01:51:59,478
I just got off the phone
with Donna Morrissey.

1964
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:02,915
She said, quote, "we don't even want to
know what the questions are," end quote.

1965
01:52:02,917 --> 01:52:04,750
- She really said that?
- Yeah.

1966
01:52:04,752 --> 01:52:06,485
Well, that ought
to do it.

1967
01:52:06,487 --> 01:52:08,220
"The church
had no interest

1968
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:10,889
in knowing what the<i> Globe's</i> questions
would be."

1969
01:52:12,092 --> 01:52:14,593
Work it in somewhere before the jump.
Anything else?

1970
01:52:14,595 --> 01:52:18,363
Matt wants to put the letters online
so the readers can see for themselves.

1971
01:52:18,365 --> 01:52:20,899
We can run the URL
at the bottom of the article.

1972
01:52:20,901 --> 01:52:22,768
- It's pretty straightforward.
- Okay.

1973
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:26,271
We also put the Spotlight tip line at the
end of the story so people can call in.

1974
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:27,773
Goes directly
to our office.

1975
01:52:27,775 --> 01:52:30,275
Matt and I can go in in the morning
in case we get any calls.

1976
01:52:30,277 --> 01:52:32,444
Yeah, I'm more concerned
about the phones at reception.

1977
01:52:32,446 --> 01:52:35,581
After we ran the Porter case,
the message centers were tied up for weeks.

1978
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:37,750
It's a real problem.
There were picketers too.

1979
01:52:37,752 --> 01:52:39,218
Lots of 'em.

1980
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,453
I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.

1981
01:52:41,455 --> 01:52:44,289
Uh, how are we coming
on the folo story?

1982
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:47,860
Well, we've nailed down
multiple stories on 70 Priests.

1983
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:50,562
- All 70?
- Mm-hmm.

1984
01:52:50,564 --> 01:52:53,132
And with confirmation from Robby's source,
we're ready to go.

1985
01:52:53,134 --> 01:52:55,367
We can have a draft
next week.

1986
01:52:55,369 --> 01:52:59,037
Robby, that source of yours,
is it something we could revisit?

1987
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,407
It might be tough.

1988
01:53:02,409 --> 01:53:05,544
But he has no problem helping the
church protect dozens of dirty Priests.

1989
01:53:05,546 --> 01:53:08,413
- Guy's a scumbag.
- He's a lawyer. He's doing his job.

1990
01:53:08,415 --> 01:53:10,916
- He's a shill for the church.
- He knew and did nothing.

1991
01:53:10,918 --> 01:53:13,485
He could've said something years ago,
maybe saved some lives.

1992
01:53:13,487 --> 01:53:16,255
What about us?

1993
01:53:16,257 --> 01:53:18,991
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We had all the pieces.

1994
01:53:18,993 --> 01:53:21,059
Why didn't<i> we</i> get it sooner?

1995
01:53:21,061 --> 01:53:23,228
We didn't have all the pieces.
We had Saviano.

1996
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:25,063
We had Barrett.
We had Geoghan.

1997
01:53:25,065 --> 01:53:26,999
We had the directories
in the basement.

1998
01:53:27,001 --> 01:53:30,836
- You know what? We got it now.
- Robby, the story needed Spotlight.

1999
01:53:30,838 --> 01:53:34,173
Mike, Spotlight's
been around since 1970.

2000
01:53:34,175 --> 01:53:37,176
So what? We couldn't see
the scope of this. No one could.

2001
01:53:37,178 --> 01:53:39,545
Robby, this started
with one goddamn Priest.

2002
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:45,017
Macleish sent us a letter
on 20 Priests years ago.

2003
01:53:45,019 --> 01:53:46,952
Sacha found the clip.

2004
01:53:46,954 --> 01:53:49,021
You freaking kidding?
Twenty Priests?

2005
01:53:49,023 --> 01:53:50,689
When?

2006
01:53:51,858 --> 01:53:54,927
Uh, just after Porter.
December '93.

2007
01:53:54,929 --> 01:53:57,663
We buried the story in Metro.
No folo.

2008
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:00,365
That was you?

2009
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,268
You were Metro.

2010
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:07,206
Yeah. That was me.

2011
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:09,708
I'd just taken over.
I don't remember it at all.

2012
01:54:10,977 --> 01:54:12,277
But yeah.

2013
01:54:15,548 --> 01:54:17,716
Um,

2014
01:54:17,718 --> 01:54:20,452
can I, uh,
say something here?

2015
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:23,488
Sometimes it's easy to forget

2016
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:27,025
that we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark.

2017
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:28,660
Suddenly a light gets turned on,

2018
01:54:28,662 --> 01:54:31,730
and there's a fair share
of blame to go around.

2019
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,235
I can't speak to
what happened before I arrived,

2020
01:54:36,237 --> 01:54:41,406
but, uh, all of you have done
some very good reporting here.

2021
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:44,076
Reporting that I believe
is gonna have an immediate

2022
01:54:44,078 --> 01:54:47,145
and considerable impact
on our readers.

2023
01:54:49,082 --> 01:54:52,584
For me, this kind of story
is why we do this.

2024
01:54:52,586 --> 01:54:54,186
Having said that,

2025
01:54:54,188 --> 01:54:56,355
Cardinal law
and the Catholic Community

2026
01:54:56,357 --> 01:54:58,724
are gonna have
a very strong response to this.

2027
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:02,094
So if you need a moment,

2028
01:55:02,096 --> 01:55:03,862
you've earned it.

2029
01:55:03,864 --> 01:55:06,398
But, uh,

2030
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,433
I will need you back here
Monday morning,

2031
01:55:08,435 --> 01:55:12,571
focused and ready
to do your job.

2032
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:23,081
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

2033
01:55:28,888 --> 01:55:31,556
I, uh, just got a call
from the Cardinal.

2034
01:55:31,558 --> 01:55:33,458
Really. Why?

2035
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:36,862
He wanted to tell me personally
that he decided not to comment.

2036
01:55:36,864 --> 01:55:41,633
Yeah. Said he wanted to, uh,
extend me that courtesy.

2037
01:55:41,635 --> 01:55:44,970
Jesus, the balls on that guy.
What did you say?

2038
01:55:44,972 --> 01:55:48,807
I told him he was making a mistake and that
we were gonna run the story.

2039
01:55:48,809 --> 01:55:51,043
Damn right
we're gonna run it.

2040
01:56:15,335 --> 01:56:17,502
Sacha, can I have
a drink of water?

2041
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:21,239
Yeah. Sure, Nana. Yeah.

2042
01:56:32,018 --> 01:56:33,652
Can I keep this?

2043
01:56:34,821 --> 01:56:36,288
Sure.

2044
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:38,857
I thought you
should see it first.

2045
01:56:38,859 --> 01:56:40,826
Thank you for bringing it by.

2046
01:56:43,196 --> 01:56:46,698
Now, I have some clients
I have to attend to.

2047
01:56:53,207 --> 01:56:55,440
Yeah.

2048
01:57:03,883 --> 01:57:05,817
Both kids were abused.

2049
01:57:05,819 --> 01:57:08,453
Jamaica Plain.
Two weeks ago.

2050
01:57:10,056 --> 01:57:14,126
Keep... doing your work,
Mr. Rezendes.

2051
01:57:15,728 --> 01:57:17,462
- Hello.
- Hello.

2052
01:57:17,464 --> 01:57:19,398
How are you guys doing?

2053
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:22,200
- Good, thanks.
- Good.

2054
01:58:08,448 --> 01:58:11,049
- Hey.
- Good morning.

2055
01:58:11,051 --> 01:58:13,085
How'd you sleep?

2056
01:58:13,087 --> 01:58:15,120
Not very well. You?

2057
01:58:15,122 --> 01:58:17,255
I haven't slept well for months.
Mmm.

2058
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:21,560
Oh, thanks.
I, uh, actually started writing.

2059
01:58:21,562 --> 01:58:23,762
Writing?
Yeah, I've been working on a book.

2060
01:58:23,764 --> 01:58:25,897
Gives me something else
to focus on.

2061
01:58:25,899 --> 01:58:29,101
What kind of book?
Horror.

2062
01:58:29,103 --> 01:58:30,602
Yeah.

2063
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:37,976
Spotlight.

2064
01:58:37,978 --> 01:58:39,478
Yeah.

2065
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:42,214
Yeah, of course. Can I, uh...
can I get your name, please?

2066
01:58:58,598 --> 01:59:01,833
You do know it's Sunday, right?
Couldn't get a tee time.

2067
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:07,139
No picketers.
Yeah.

2068
01:59:07,141 --> 01:59:09,674
Probably still at church.

2069
01:59:11,344 --> 01:59:14,312
Hey, Linda.
It's quiet, huh?

2070
01:59:14,314 --> 01:59:16,481
Yeah. Easiest overtime
I ever made.

2071
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:18,316
Phone hasn't rung once.

2072
01:59:18,318 --> 01:59:20,919
Marty sent two of mine
down to Spotlight.

2073
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:25,757
Great article, guys.
Thank you.

2074
01:59:25,759 --> 01:59:28,026
Thanks.
Spotlight?

2075
01:59:51,284 --> 01:59:52,651
Okay. Yep.

2076
01:59:52,653 --> 01:59:54,452
Spotlight. Can I help you?

2077
01:59:54,454 --> 01:59:56,221
Phones have been ringing
all morning.

2078
01:59:56,223 --> 01:59:58,490
Spotlight.

2079
01:59:58,492 --> 02:00:00,759
- Mike, can you grab that?
- Yeah, yeah.

2080
02:00:01,661 --> 02:00:04,029
They're almost all victims,
Robby.

2081
02:00:05,965 --> 02:00:09,067
- I'm sorry to make you wait.
- Sacha Pfeiffer.

2082
02:00:09,069 --> 02:00:10,902
I'm sorry...
can you...

2083
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:14,873
yes, you can reach me here.

2084
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:17,242
This is Spotlight.

2085
02:00:20,013 --> 02:00:21,646
Can I get your name?

2086
02:00:21,648 --> 02:00:25,850
Did you happen to have any contact
with anybody that was there afterward?

2087
02:00:25,852 --> 02:00:28,987
Do you remember
what year this was?

2088
02:00:28,989 --> 02:00:31,256
Which parish was it?

2089
02:00:31,258 --> 02:00:32,924
This is Spotlight.
