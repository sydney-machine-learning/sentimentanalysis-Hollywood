1
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,675
This will begin to make things right.

2
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:03,477
I travelled too far and seen too much to
ignore the despair in the galaxy.

3
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:07,968
Without the Jedi, there can
be no balance in the Force.

4
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,043
Because of you, now we have a chance.

5
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:13,088
The General has been
after this for a long time.

6
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,744
The General?

7
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,231
To me she is royalty.

8
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,349
Well she certainly is that.

9
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,473
We've got company.

10
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,396
You have to hide.

11
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,233
You have to leave.

12
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:45,436
Go!

13
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,451
Come on BB-8, hurry!

14
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:33,589
<i>Shoot him that X-wing!
There! There!</i>

15
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:40,764
I see them.

16
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,123
You take this.
It's safer with you than it is with me.

17
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,857
You get as far away
from here as you can.

18
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,135
Did you hear me?

19
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:22,178
I'll come back for you.

20
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,694
It'll be all right.

21
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,322
<i>Keep moving!</i>

22
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:28,526
Stay here.

23
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,701
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

24
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,831
Something far worse has happened to you.

25
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,232
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

26
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,418
I know where you come from.

27
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,738
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

28
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,756
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

29
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,368
<i>And now you're going to
give it to the First Order.</i>

30
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,036
The First Order arose
from the dark side.

31
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:17,273
You did not.

32
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:20,914
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

33
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,635
You may try.

34
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:27,214
But you cannot deny the truth
that is your family.

35
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,193
<i>You're so right.</i>

36
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,815
So who talks first?
Do you talk first? I talk first?

37
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,268
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

38
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,121
It's very hard to understand
you with all those

39
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:11,235
<i>Search him.</i>

40
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,236
Apparatus.

41
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:16,888
<i>Nothing, sir.</i>

42
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:17,989
<i>Bring him on board.</i>

43
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,533
<i>Sir, the villagers?</i>

44
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,634
<i>Kill them all!</i>

45
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,127
<i>On my command.</i>

46
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,230
<i>Fire!</i>

47
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:37,539
No Please!

48
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:07,731
<i>Nothing here! Keep moving!</i>

49
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,024
All right, all right!

50
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,680
<i>FN-2187.</i>

51
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:21,915
<i>Send your blaster for inspection.</i>

52
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Yes, Captain.

53
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:26,956
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

54
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:28,486
I'm sorry, Captain.

55
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,979
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

56
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,535
What you brought me today is worth ...

57
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,359
one quarter portion.

58
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,120
Tal'ama parqual!

59
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,279
Parqual! Zatana!

60
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:17,795
Noma!

61
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,319
Shh!

62
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:28,982
That's just Teedo.
Wants you for parts.

63
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:31,505
He has no respect for anyone.

64
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:36,494
Your antenna is bent.

65
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,335
Where do you come from?

66
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:54,279
Classified, really?
Me too. Big secret.

67
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,285
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

68
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:01,865
Keep away from the sinking fields in the north.
You will drown in the sand.

69
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,023
Don't follow me.
The town is that way.

70
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:14,174
No!

71
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,088
In the morning you go.

72
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:38,923
You are welcome.

73
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:54,835
<i>I had no idea we had the best
pilot of the Resistance on board.</i>

74
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,126
<i>Are you comfortable?</i>

75
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,079
Not really.

76
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:02,537
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

77
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,772
<i>No one has been
able to get out of you</i>

78
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:10,359
<i>What did you did with the map.</i>

79
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,113
Might want to rethink
your technique.

80
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:30,944
<i>Where is it?</i>

81
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:36,647
The Resistance will not
be intimidated by you.

82
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:43,744
<i>Where is it?</i>

83
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,258
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

84
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,693
Well then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

85
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:00,954
<i>I'll leave it to you.</i>

86
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,409
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

87
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,115
Whoever it is your
waiting for, Classified.

88
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,862
I know all about waiting.

89
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,890
My family.

90
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:18,412
They'll be back.
One day.

91
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,135
Come on.

92
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:26,500
These five pieces are worth ...

93
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,675
Let me see...

94
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:32,087
One half portion.

95
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,134
Last week they were
a half portion each.

96
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:35,979
What about the droid?

97
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:39,959
What about him?

98
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:42,025
I'll pay for him.

99
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,188
60 portions.

100
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:03,494
Actually...

101
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,033
The droid is not for sale.

102
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:10,627
Come on.

103
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,490
Follow the girl and get that droid.

104
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,576
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

105
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>Turn here.</i>

106
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,382
<i>Listen carefully. If you do exactly
as I say, I can get out of here.</i>

107
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,583
What?

108
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,687
This is a rescue.
I'm helping you escape.

109
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:44,523
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

110
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,730
Are you with the Resistance?

111
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,796
What? No no.
I'm breaking you out.

112
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,917
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

113
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:53,035
Why? Why are you helping me?

114
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,145
Because it is the
right thing to do.

115
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,219
You need a pilot.

116
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,734
I need a pilot.

117
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:02,351
We're gonna do this.

118
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:03,797
Yeah?

119
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,177
<i>Okay, stay calm.
Stay calm.</i>

120
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:11,378
I am calm.

121
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,038
<i>I'm talking to myself.</i>

122
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:16,262
<i>Not yet.</i>

123
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:19,511
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

124
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,009
I always wanted to fly one of these things.

125
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,163
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

126
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:31,428
Okay, same principle.

127
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,764
Use the toggle on the left to switch between
missiles, cannons and pulses.

128
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:37,013
Use the sight on the right to aim.
The triggers to fire.

129
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,273
This is very complicated.

130
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:45,857
I can fix this.

131
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,703
An unsanctioned departure from bay 2.

132
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,675
Alert General Hux.
And stop to that fighter.

133
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,608
14, missed 18 ...

134
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:18,888
I got it.

135
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:24,803
This really moves.

136
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:32,731
All right we gotta take out as many of these
cannons as we can if we're going to get very far.

137
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,690
All right.

138
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:35,505
I'm gonna get us in position.
Just stay sharp!

139
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,170
Up ahead! Up ahead!
You see it?

140
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,363
I got us dead center.
It's a clean shot.

141
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:52,961
- Yeah!
- Yes!

142
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,531
You see that? Did you see that?

143
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:55,632
I saw it!

144
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,356
Hey, what's your name?

145
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,761
FN-2187.

146
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:05,145
F ... what?

147
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,016
It's the only name they ever gave me.

148
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,597
Well, I ain't using it.
F-N, huh?

149
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:11,104
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

150
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:12,105
That all right?

151
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,544
Finn. Yes. Finn, I like that.

152
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:15,545
I like that.

153
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,860
I am Poe. Poe Dameron.

154
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,081
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

155
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:24,552
Sir, they've taken out
our turbolasers.

156
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,147
Use the ventral cannons.

157
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,104
Yes sir. Bringing them online.

158
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,089
<i>General Hux, is it
the Resistance pilot?</i>

159
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,967
Yes, and he had help.
From one of our own.

160
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:39,953
We are checking the registers now
to identify which Stormtrooper it was.

161
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:43,367
<i>The one from the village.
FN-2187.</i>

162
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,899
Sir, ventral cannon's hot.

163
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,571
Fire.

164
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:59,104
It's coming towards you!
On my right. Your left. See it?

165
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,436
Hold on. I see it!

166
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:05,929
Nice shot!

167
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:13,618
Where we going?

168
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,919
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

169
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:18,040
Oh no, we can't go back to Jakku.
We need to get out of this system.

170
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,001
I got to get my droid before
the First Order does.

171
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,411
Your droid?
- That's right.

172
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,646
It's a BB unit, orange and white.
One of a kind.

173
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:26,089
I do not care what color he is!
No droid can be as important.

174
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,167
This one is, pal!

175
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,208
We have to move as far away
from the First Order as we can.

176
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,644
If we go back to Jakku, we die.

177
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:33,160
The droid has a map that
leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

178
00:23:33,593 --> 00:23:35,031
You got to be kidding me!

179
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:43,951
<i>FN-2187 reported to my division,
was evaluated and sent to reconditioning.</i>

180
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,203
No prior signs of nonconformity?

181
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,027
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

182
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,228
General!

183
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:50,452
They've been hit.

184
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:52,213
- Destroyed?
- Disabled.

185
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,492
They were heading back to Jakku.

186
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:55,872
The fighter's projected to crash
in the Goazon Badlands.

187
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,854
They were going back for the droid.
Send a squad to the wreckage.

188
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,424
Poe!

189
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:25,875
Poe!

190
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:27,757
Poe!

191
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:32,815
Poe! I got you.

192
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:35,919
Poe!

193
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:43,774
Poe!

194
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:10,092
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.</i>

195
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:12,622
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

196
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,818
<i>How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

197
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,259
I won't have you question my methods.

198
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,452
<i>Who are obviously skilled at
committing high treason.</i>

199
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:21,212
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

200
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,588
My men are exceptionally trained.
Programmed from birth.

201
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:26,209
<i>Then they should not have problem
retrieving the droid.</i>

202
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,294
<i>Unharmed.</i>

203
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:33,035
Careful Ren. That your personal interests
not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

204
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,408
<i>I want that map.</i>

205
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:38,311
<i>For your sake, I suggest you get it.</i>

206
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,176
Water. Water.

207
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:47,177
There is no water.

208
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,178
Water.

209
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:51,888
Where's water?

210
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:20,932
What?

211
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,293
Get away!

212
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:32,904
Hey!

213
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,067
They work for Unkar.

214
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:52,940
That guy you wanted.

215
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:54,956
He must be very interested in you.

216
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,929
Him?

217
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,451
What's your hurry thief?

218
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,266
What? Thief?

219
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:26,798
Hey! What?

220
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:28,665
The jacket.
This droid says you stole it.

221
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,564
I've had a pretty messed up day, all right?

222
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,200
So I'd appreciate if
would stop accusing me of ...

223
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:36,411
- Stop it!
- Where did you get it?

224
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:37,939
It belongs to his master.

225
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:44,281
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

226
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:48,868
He was captured by the First Order.

227
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:51,813
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

228
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,115
Poe didn't make it.

229
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,912
I tried to help. I'm sorry.

230
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,776
So you're with the Resistance?

231
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:18,736
Obviously.

232
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,228
Yes I am.

233
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,250
I'm with the resistance.
Yeah, I am with the resistance.

234
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,890
I've never met a Resistance fighter before.

235
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:33,072
Well, this is what we look like.
Some of us. Others look different.

236
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:36,186
BB-8 says he is on a secret mission.
He has to get back to your base.

237
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:38,747
Apparently he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker

238
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,518
and everyone's after it.

239
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,727
Luke Skywalker?

240
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:44,618
I thought he was a myth.

241
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,478
What?

242
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,441
- What do you doing?
- Come on.

243
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:58,923
Come on BB-8!

244
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,085
- Let go of me.
- No, we gotta move!

245
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:06,260
I know how to run without
you holding my hand!

246
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:09,778
BB-8, stay close!

247
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,412
This way.

248
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:23,713
They were shooting at both of us.

249
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,764
Yes, they saw you with me.
You're marked.

250
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:27,078
Well, thanks for that.

251
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:29,533
Hey! I'm not the one who
chased you down with a stick.

252
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,500
Does anyone have blasters around here?

253
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:32,501
Are you okay?

254
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:41,110
Stop taking my hand!

255
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:57,727
Hey.

256
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:02,011
Are you okay?

257
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,922
Yeah.

258
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:06,726
Follow me.

259
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:18,815
We can't out run them!

260
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,625
We might!
In that quad jumper!

261
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:22,716
We need a pilot!

262
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:23,817
We got one.

263
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:24,918
You?

264
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,656
What about that ship?

265
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,351
That one's garbage!

266
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,133
Garbage will do.

267
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:53,835
The gunner's position is down there!

268
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:58,740
You ever fly this thing?

269
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:01,755
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

270
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,049
Great.

271
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:10,865
I can do this.
I can do this.

272
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:13,031
I can do this.
I can do this.

273
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,004
Hey!

274
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,786
That's mine!

275
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,010
Wait, stay low.
Stay low.

276
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:47,111
- What?
- Stay low!

277
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,407
That confuses their tracking.

278
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,772
BB-8, hold on!

279
00:32:51,073 --> 00:32:52,548
I'm going low!

280
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,037
What are you doing back there?

281
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:13,276
Are you ever going to fire back?

282
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:14,829
I'm working on it!

283
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,264
- Are the shields up?
- Not so easy without a copilot.

284
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,360
Try sitting on this thing.

285
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,290
We need cover, quick!

286
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,534
We're about to get some!

287
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:37,735
I hope.

288
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:04,575
Dammit!

289
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,593
Come on!
Come on!

290
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,846
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

291
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:38,943
The cannon is stuck in forward position.
I can't move it.

292
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,197
You got to lose them.

293
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,868
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

294
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,770
Are we really doing this?

295
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,690
Oh no.

296
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:50,373
- Nice shooting.
- Nice flying.

297
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:51,374
Thanks.

298
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,375
- How did you do it?
- I don't know.

299
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:53,376
No one trained you?

300
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,793
I've piloted ships,
but I've never left the planet.

301
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:56,075
- Your last shot was great.
- That was amazing.

302
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,529
- You got him on the first blast!
- You set me up good.

303
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,950
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

304
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,649
You are okay.
He's with the Resistance.

305
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:07,596
He's going to get you home.

306
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:09,759
We both will.

307
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:16,723
I don't know your name.

308
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,259
Finn. What's yours?

309
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,626
I am Rey.

310
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:27,855
Rey...

311
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:31,231
Help me with this. Quick!

312
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:32,857
What's going on?

313
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:47,901
Sir, we were unable to
acquire the droid on Jakku.

314
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,487
It escaped capture aboard a
stolen Corellian YT model freighter.

315
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:59,539
<i>The droid ...
Stole a freighter?</i>

316
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,140
Not exactly, sir.

317
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:02,949
It had help.

318
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,500
We have no confirmation

319
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,986
but we believe that FN-2187
May have helped him escape.

320
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:29,495
<i>Anything else?</i>

321
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,002
The two were accompanied by a girl.

322
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:40,956
<i>What girl?</i>

323
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,261
It's the motivator.
Grab me a Harris wrench, check in there.

324
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,462
How bad is it?

325
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,228
If we want to live it is not good.

326
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:51,589
They're hunting for us now.
We've got to get out of this system!

327
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:54,157
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance base is "need to know."

328
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,058
If I'm taking you there,
I need to know.

329
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,159
This?

330
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:00,009
You gotta tell us where your base is.

331
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:02,785
I don't speak that.

332
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:06,119
Okay, between us,
I'm not with the resistance, okay?

333
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,979
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

334
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,096
But you tell us where your base is,
I'll get you there first.

335
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,880
Deal?

336
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:13,893
Droid, please!

337
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:15,466
Pilex driver, hurry.

338
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:18,248
- So where's your base?
- Come on, BB-8 tell her.

339
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:22,605
Please.

340
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:27,251
- The Illenium system?
- Yeah, the Illenium System, that's the one.

341
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:28,804
Get us there as fast as you can.

342
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,367
I'll drop you two at the Ponemah Terminal.
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

343
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:32,372
What about you?

344
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:33,804
I've got to get back to Jakku.

345
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,587
Back to Jakku...
Why does everyone want to go back to Jakku?

346
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:37,152
Not that one.

347
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,217
- That place is ...
- No no.

348
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:40,341
Then one I am pointing to.

349
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,320
No no no!

350
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,148
If we don't patch this up, the
propulsion tank will overflow

351
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:46,893
and flood this ship with poison gas.

352
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:47,894
- This?
- Yes.

353
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:54,070
Rey, you are a pilot. You can fly
anywhere. Why go back?

354
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,371
Do you have family?

355
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:56,975
Do you have a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?

356
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,440
None of your business, that's why.

357
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:02,430
- That can't be good.
- Can't be.

358
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,199
Someone is locked onto us.

359
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,249
All controls are overridden.

360
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,908
Get off! Get off!

361
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,005
You see anything?

362
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Oh no.

363
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:33,585
It is the First Order.

364
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,619
What do we do?
There must be something.

365
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:38,268
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

366
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,269
Can you unfix it?

367
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,062
Come on, BB-8.

368
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:47,643
I've got it.

369
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:51,844
I'm okay.

370
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:58,234
Do you think this will work
on the Stormtroopers?

371
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:01,104
Yeah, their masks filter
out smoke, not toxins.

372
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:09,552
- Hurry!
- I'm hurrying.

373
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,156
Chewie...

374
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,880
We're home.

375
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:43,223
Where are the others?
Where is the pilot?

376
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,615
- I'm the pilot.
- You?

377
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:47,859
<i>No, it's true.
We are the only ones on board.</i>

378
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,155
<i>You can understand this thing?</i>

379
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,612
And <i>that thing</i> can also
understand you too, so watch it.

380
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:52,790
Come on out.

381
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:56,498
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niiman Outpost.

382
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:58,381
Jakku? That junkyard?

383
00:40:58,682 --> 00:40:59,682
Thank you! Junk yard.

384
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:02,363
I told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

385
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:04,151
Who had it? Ducain?

386
00:41:04,252 --> 00:41:06,130
I stole. From Unkar Plutt.

387
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,371
He stole it from the Irving boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

388
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:10,707
Who stole it from me!

389
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,751
Well you tell him that Han Solo just stole
back the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

390
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:17,835
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?
You're Han Solo?

391
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:20,914
I used to be.

392
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,183
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

393
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:25,040
No, the smuggler.

394
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,380
Wasn't he a war hero?

395
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:29,833
This is the ship that made the
Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

396
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:31,204
12!

397
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,809
14.

398
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,269
Hey!

399
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,701
Some moof-milker put a
compressor on the ignition line.

400
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,008
Unkar Plutt did.

401
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,525
I thought it was a mistake too.
Puts too much stress

402
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:58,681
- on the hyperdrive.
- Stress on the hyperdrive.

403
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:01,310
Chewie, throw them a pod.

404
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,586
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

405
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:06,364
Wait. No, we need your help.

406
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:07,537
My help?

407
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:10,673
This droid has to go to the
Resistance base as soon as possible.

408
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:13,670
He's carrying a map to
Luke Skywalker.

409
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:20,747
You are the Han Solo
that fought with the Rebellion.

410
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:28,204
You knew him?

411
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,226
Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.

412
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:41,415
Don't tell me a rathtar's gotten loose.

413
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:43,147
Wait, what?

414
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:45,774
Did you just say rathtars?

415
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,541
Hey!

416
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:50,080
You're not hauling rathtars
in this freighter, are you?

417
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,005
I'm hauling rathtars.

418
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:56,133
Oh great. It's a Guavian Death Gang.

419
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:57,754
Must have tracked
us from Nantoon.

420
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,421
What is a rathar?

421
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:01,106
They're big and they're dangerous.

422
00:43:01,107 --> 00:43:02,872
Have you heard of the Trilla Massacre?

423
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:04,252
- No.
- Good.

424
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:05,931
I got three of them going to King Prana.

425
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:08,094
Three? How'd you get them on board?

426
00:43:08,408 --> 00:43:10,148
We used to have a bigger crew.

427
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,607
Get below and stay
there until I say so

428
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,119
and don't even think
about taking the <i>Falcon</i>

429
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,129
What about BB-8?

430
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:22,146
He stays with me until I get rid of gang.
You can have him back and then be on your way.

431
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,208
And the rathtars?
Where you keeping them?

432
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:26,995
There's one.

433
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:28,229
What are you going to do?

434
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,098
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

435
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,120
Yes I do! Every time.

436
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:54,901
Han Solo. You're a dead man.

437
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,753
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

438
00:43:58,086 --> 00:44:00,723
The problem is that we
loaned you 50,000 for this job.

439
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:01,924
Can you see them?

440
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:03,125
No.

441
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:06,456
I heard also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

442
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:08,838
You know you can't
trust those little freaks.

443
00:44:09,488 --> 00:44:11,027
How long have we known each other?

444
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:12,960
They have blasters.

445
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:13,961
A lot of them.

446
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:17,411
Not long.
We want our money back now.

447
00:44:17,712 --> 00:44:20,735
Do you think hunting rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.

448
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:23,197
Kanjiklub wants their
investment back too.

449
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:25,555
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

450
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:27,610
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

451
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,431
Tasu Leech. Good to see you.

452
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:44,835
Wrong again, Solo.
It's over for you and your associate.

453
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,991
Boys, you're both going
to get what I promised.

454
00:44:52,262 --> 00:44:54,682
Have I ever not delivered for you before?

455
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:55,383
Yes.

456
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,817
Twice.

457
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:00,936
What was the second time?

458
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:02,237
Your game is old.

459
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,132
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

460
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,735
Nowhere left for you to hide.

461
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:08,635
That BB unit.

462
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:11,701
The First Order is looking
one just like it.

463
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:16,505
And two fugitives.

464
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,417
First I've heard of it.

465
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,235
Search the freighter.

466
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:28,213
Wait wait.

467
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:34,845
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor, we can trap both gangs.

468
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:36,369
You can close them from here?

469
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,285
Reset the fuses should do it.

470
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:48,039
I got a bad feeling about this.

471
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:49,235
Oh no.

472
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:50,236
'Oh, no "what?

473
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,384
Wrong fuses.

474
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:53,385
Kill them!

475
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,771
And take the droid!

476
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:21,563
That was a mistake!

477
00:46:21,564 --> 00:46:22,564
Huge!

478
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,780
What do they look like?

479
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:44,113
They look like that.

480
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,137
- This way.
- Are you sure?

481
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:51,728
No! No!

482
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:53,344
Finn!

483
00:46:54,753 --> 00:46:55,753
Finn!

484
00:46:57,618 --> 00:46:58,618
Rey!

485
00:47:01,684 --> 00:47:02,911
Get out!

486
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:09,285
Rey!

487
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:10,586
Finn!

488
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,046
Finn!

489
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:14,869
<i>Get off!</i>

490
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,441
<i>Rey!</i>

491
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:34,480
Get off! Get off!

492
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:37,822
Finn!

493
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:40,253
It had me! But the door ...

494
00:47:40,254 --> 00:47:41,254
That was lucky.

495
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,897
I got the door. Cover us!

496
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:56,248
Chewie!

497
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,210
You okay?

498
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:02,958
Wow.

499
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:06,261
Come on! Come on!

500
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:12,919
- Han.
- You shut the door behind you.

501
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:14,512
You, take care of Chewie!

502
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:23,415
Where are you going?

503
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:26,955
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too.
If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere.

504
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,139
I hate that guy.

505
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,923
- And you can use a co-pilot.
- I've got one, he's back there.

506
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,535
Watch the thrust.
We're going out of here at light speed.

507
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:37,275
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

508
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:39,601
I've never asked that question
until after I've done it.

509
00:48:41,826 --> 00:48:43,888
This is not how I thought
this day was going to go.

510
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,990
Angle the shield.
Hang on back there!

511
00:48:46,235 --> 00:48:47,235
No problem!

512
00:48:57,317 --> 00:48:58,557
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

513
00:49:00,747 --> 00:49:01,747
What?

514
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:02,848
The compressor.

515
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,489
Inform the First Order that
Han Solo has the droid they want.

516
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,617
And it's on board the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

517
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:30,003
The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance

518
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:35,000
leading them to the last Jedi.

519
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:40,013
If Skywalker returns,

520
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:44,406
the new Jedi will rise.

521
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:47,345
Supreme leader,
I take full responsibility.

522
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:49,440
General!

523
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:54,073
Our strategy must now change.

524
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,192
The weapon. It is ready.

525
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,414
I believe the time has come to use it.

526
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:01,319
We shall destroy the government
that supports the Resistance:

527
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,074
The Republic.

528
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:06,435
Without their friends to protect them,
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

529
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,494
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

530
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:10,999
Go.

531
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:13,170
Oversee preparations.

532
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:14,966
Yes. Supreme Leader.

533
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,224
There has been an awakening.

534
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:25,612
Have you felt it?

535
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,327
<i>Yes.</i>

536
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,321
There's something more.

537
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:37,112
The droid we seek
is aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

538
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:40,569
In the hands of your father ...

539
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:44,528
Han Solo.

540
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:49,048
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

541
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:54,633
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren.

542
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:58,478
Have never faced such a test.

543
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:02,536
<i>By the grace of his training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

544
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:05,269
We shall see.

545
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:10,209
We shall see.

546
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:18,969
Electrical overload.

547
00:51:19,018 --> 00:51:20,237
I can fix that.

548
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:21,538
Coolant leak.

549
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:24,011
Try transferring the auxiliary power

550
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:25,527
- to the secondary tank.
- Secondary tank.

551
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:26,528
I got it.

552
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,997
Chewie, come on!

553
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:32,534
I need help with
this giant hairy thing!

554
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,722
Stop it!

555
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:35,954
Chewie!

556
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:39,415
If you hurt Chewie,
you're going to deal with me.

557
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:41,469
Hurt him?
He almost killed me six times.

558
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:43,777
Which is fine!

559
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:47,346
If this hyperdrive blows there's gonna be
pieces of us in three different systems.

560
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:51,856
What did you do?

561
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:54,745
I bypassed the compressor.

562
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:58,769
Huh?

563
00:52:01,602 --> 00:52:02,646
Move, ball.

564
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:08,594
Don't say that.
You did great. You just rest.

565
00:52:09,532 --> 00:52:10,693
Good job, kid.

566
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,212
Thanks.

567
00:52:12,513 --> 00:52:13,513
You're welcome.

568
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:19,931
So.

569
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:21,493
Fugitives, huh?

570
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:24,692
The First Order want that map.

571
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,093
Finn is with the Resistance.

572
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:28,395
I'm just a scavenger.

573
00:52:30,245 --> 00:52:31,245
Let's see what you got.

574
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:33,939
Go ahead.

575
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:45,503
This map is not complete.

576
00:52:45,572 --> 00:52:46,768
It's just a piece.

577
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,390
Ever since Luke disappeared
people been looking for him.

578
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,598
Why did he leave?

579
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:57,635
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

580
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:01,684
One boy, an apprentice,
turned against him, destroyed it all.

581
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:08,008
Luke felt responsible.
He just walked away from everything.

582
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,952
Do you know what happened to him?

583
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,011
A lot of rumors. Stories.

584
00:53:14,643 --> 00:53:16,795
People who knew him best,

585
00:53:18,557 --> 00:53:20,682
think he went looking for
the first Jedi Temple.

586
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,775
The Jedi were real.

587
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:28,284
I used to wonder about that myself.
I thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

588
00:53:29,278 --> 00:53:33,962
A magical power holding together good
and evil, the dark side and light.

589
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:37,397
The crazy thing is

590
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,358
it's true.

591
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,663
The Force. The Jedi.

592
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:49,211
All of it.

593
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:53,589
It's all true.

594
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,102
No, you rest.

595
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,945
You want my help?
You're getting it.

596
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:04,546
We're gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

597
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:06,708
This is our stop.

598
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:26,866
I didn't know there was this
much green in the whole galaxy.

599
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:56,952
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure
what we're walking into here

600
00:54:57,123 --> 00:54:58,654
Did you just call me Solo?

601
00:54:58,855 --> 00:55:00,404
Sorry, Han. Mr. Solo.

602
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:03,812
You should know that I'm
a big deal with the Resistance.

603
00:55:04,113 --> 00:55:06,324
What puts a real target on my back.

604
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:07,948
Are there any conspirators here?

605
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:10,372
First Order sympathizers?

606
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:14,366
Listen, Big Deal.
You got another problem.

607
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:17,073
Women always figure out the truth.

608
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:20,077
Always.

609
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,503
You might need this.

610
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:30,246
I think I can handle myself.

611
00:55:30,642 --> 00:55:32,735
I know you do.
That's why I'm giving it to you.

612
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:33,935
Take it.

613
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:37,751
You know how to use one of those?

614
00:55:37,852 --> 00:55:39,546
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

615
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:41,360
Little bit more to it than that.

616
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:43,581
You got a lot to learn.

617
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,207
You got a name?

618
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,199
Rey.

619
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,803
Rey.

620
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:56,291
I've been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

621
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:58,166
A second mate.
Someone to help out.

622
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:01,565
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me and appreciates the <i>Falcon</i>.

623
00:56:01,655 --> 00:56:03,268
Are you offering me a job?

624
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,099
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

625
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:08,060
You're offering me a job.

626
00:56:09,376 --> 00:56:10,761
I'm thinking about it.

627
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:15,398
Well?

628
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:22,898
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to go home.

629
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:25,338
Where Jakku?

630
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,389
I've already been away too long.

631
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:32,079
Chewie, check out the ship
the best you can.

632
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:38,244
It's too bad.
Chewie kind of likes you.

633
00:56:41,573 --> 00:56:43,042
So, why are we here again?

634
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:44,868
To get your droid
to a clean ship.

635
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:45,932
Clean?

636
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,739
Do you think it was luck that
Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon</i>?

637
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:53,135
If we could find it on our scanners,
the First Order's not far behind.

638
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:58,487
Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance,
Maz Kanata is our best bet.

639
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:00,524
We can trust her, right?

640
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:01,925
Relax, kid.

641
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,014
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

642
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:09,097
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste,
So let me do the talking and

643
00:57:09,355 --> 00:57:11,036
whatever you do, don't stare.

644
00:57:11,037 --> 00:57:12,037
At what?

645
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:14,147
Any of it.

646
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:37,185
Han Solo!

647
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:42,731
Oh boy.

648
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:44,016
Hey, Maz.

649
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:49,744
Where is my boyfriend?

650
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:51,779
Chewie is working
on the <i>Falcon</i>.

651
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,023
I like that Wookiee.

652
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:57,187
I assume you need something.
Desperately.

653
00:57:57,315 --> 00:57:58,368
Let's get to it.

654
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:25,569
Alert the Resistance

655
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,088
their lost droid is here!

656
00:58:33,494 --> 00:58:37,615
Inform the First Order.
I've found the droid.

657
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,272
<i>Forgive me.</i>

658
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:58,673
<i>I feel it again.</i>

659
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,792
<i>The call to the light.</i>

660
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:09,046
<i>The Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

661
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:11,554
<i>Show me again.</i>

662
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,991
<i>The power of darkness.</i>

663
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:17,989
<i>And I will let nothing stand
on our way.</i>

664
00:59:19,072 --> 00:59:20,491
<i>Show me ...</i>

665
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:24,123
Grandfather...

666
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:30,414
<i>and I will finish what you started.</i>

667
00:59:43,345 --> 00:59:44,471
A map.

668
00:59:44,562 --> 00:59:46,277
To Skywalker himself?

669
00:59:46,278 --> 00:59:47,350
You're right back in this whole mess.

670
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,798
Maz, I need you to bring
this droid to Leia.

671
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:52,757
No.

672
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:58,124
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

673
00:59:58,525 --> 00:59:59,678
Han.

674
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:03,825
Go home.

675
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:05,760
Leia doesn't want to see me.

676
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:07,962
Please, we came here for your help.

677
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,410
What fight?

678
01:00:11,422 --> 01:00:13,400
The only fight.

679
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,640
Against the dark side.

680
01:00:15,835 --> 01:00:19,335
Through the ages, I've seen evil
take many forms.

681
01:00:20,476 --> 01:00:22,906
The Sith. The Empire.

682
01:00:23,038 --> 01:00:26,081
Today it is the First Order.

683
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:29,819
Their shadow spreading
across the galaxy.

684
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:31,547
You must face them.

685
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:33,539
Fight them.

686
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,272
All of us.

687
01:00:36,004 --> 01:00:37,368
There is no fight
against the First Order.

688
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:38,626
Not one we can win.

689
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:40,896
Look around.

690
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:43,332
There is no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

691
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:45,980
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

692
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,120
What's this?

693
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:50,890
What are you doing?

694
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,185
Solo, what is she doing?

695
01:00:57,477 --> 01:00:59,074
I don't know. But it ain't good.

696
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,418
If you live long enough, you see
the same eyes in different people.

697
01:01:05,387 --> 01:01:09,933
I am looking into the eyes of a man
who wants to run.

698
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:15,086
You don't know a thing about me.

699
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:19,131
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

700
01:01:20,063 --> 01:01:22,548
You don't know the
First Order like I do.

701
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:24,661
They will slaughter us.

702
01:01:25,673 --> 01:01:27,669
We all need to run.

703
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,332
Do you see those two?

704
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:40,632
They will trade work for
transportation to the Outer Rim.

705
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:43,303
There, you can disappear.

706
01:01:43,735 --> 01:01:44,735
Finn?

707
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:47,983
Come with me.

708
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:51,094
What about BB-8?
We're not done here.

709
01:01:51,195 --> 01:01:52,870
We have to get him back to your base.

710
01:01:57,906 --> 01:01:59,231
I can't.

711
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,283
Keep it, kid.

712
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:21,506
Who's the girl?

713
01:02:25,878 --> 01:02:27,798
I was told you could get
me to the Outer Rim.

714
01:02:27,951 --> 01:02:29,032
What do you doing?

715
01:02:30,783 --> 01:02:31,797
Don't leave without me.

716
01:02:35,716 --> 01:02:37,276
You can't just go.
I won't let you.

717
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,486
I'm not who you think I am.

718
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:39,687
Finn, what are you talking about?

719
01:02:39,776 --> 01:02:40,900
I'm not Resistance.

720
01:02:41,485 --> 01:02:42,909
I'm not a hero.

721
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:47,865
I am a Stormtrooper.

722
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:52,142
Like all of them, I was taken from
a family I will never know.

723
01:02:52,962 --> 01:02:54,780
And raised to do one thing.

724
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:58,589
But in my first battle,
I made a choice.

725
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:01,631
I wasn't going to kill for them.

726
01:03:02,422 --> 01:03:05,072
So I ran. Right into you.

727
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:09,045
And you look at me
like no one ever had.

728
01:03:12,048 --> 01:03:14,217
I was ashamed of what I was.

729
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,641
But I am done with the First Order.

730
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:20,549
I am never going back.

731
01:03:22,596 --> 01:03:24,455
Rey, come with me.

732
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,529
Don't go.

733
01:03:31,944 --> 01:03:33,713
Take care of yourself.

734
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:37,163
Please.

735
01:03:50,982 --> 01:03:52,572
<i>No!</i>

736
01:03:53,023 --> 01:03:55,131
<i>No!</i>

737
01:04:08,033 --> 01:04:11,542
<i>No! Come back!</i>

738
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,210
<i>No!</i>

739
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:32,112
<i>Come back!</i>

740
01:04:42,532 --> 01:04:44,447
<i>No!</i>

741
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:36,396
<i>No!</i>

742
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:38,519
<i>His energy ...</i>

743
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:42,936
<i>No!</i>

744
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:46,661
<i>It surrounds us ... and binds us.</i>

745
01:05:55,009 --> 01:05:56,009
<i>The Force will ...</i>

746
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:06,348
<i>No!</i>

747
01:06:06,584 --> 01:06:08,369
Come back!

748
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:09,967
Quiet, girl.

749
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,054
Don't!

750
01:06:16,653 --> 01:06:17,653
<i>Rey?</i>

751
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:24,768
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

752
01:06:29,863 --> 01:06:30,863
What was that?

753
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:34,803
I shouldn't have gone in there.

754
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:39,410
That lightsaber was Luke's.

755
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,277
And his father's before him.

756
01:06:41,478 --> 01:06:44,677
And now, he calls to you.

757
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,625
I have to go back to Jakku.

758
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:49,185
Han told me.

759
01:06:56,794 --> 01:07:00,674
Dear child, I see your eyes.

760
01:07:01,024 --> 01:07:03,599
You already know the truth.

761
01:07:04,225 --> 01:07:06,647
Whomever you are waiting for on Jakku.

762
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,727
They're never coming back.

763
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:19,411
But there is someone
who still could.

764
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:23,446
Luke.

765
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:27,527
The belonging you seek
is not behind you

766
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:29,085
it is ahead.

767
01:07:29,486 --> 01:07:32,743
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

768
01:07:33,128 --> 01:07:37,173
It moves through and
surrounds every living thing.

769
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,133
Close your eyes.

770
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:43,938
Feel it.

771
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:47,332
The light...

772
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:49,805
It's always been there.

773
01:07:50,102 --> 01:07:51,971
It will guide you.

774
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,181
The saber. Take it.

775
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:03,635
I'm never touching that thing again.
I don't want any part of this.

776
01:08:30,014 --> 01:08:33,758
<i>Today is the end of the Republic.</i>

777
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:41,054
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

778
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:46,390
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here</i>

779
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:50,716
<i>the New Republic
lies to the galaxy</i>

780
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:55,115
<i>while secretly
supporting the treachery</i>

781
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:59,080
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

782
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:02,467
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built</i>

783
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:07,235
<i>upon which we stand,
will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

784
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,925
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

785
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:14,658
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

786
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:17,090
<i>And will remember this!</i>

787
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:22,535
<i>As the last day of the Republic!</i>

788
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,368
Transfer to manual control.

789
01:09:26,616 --> 01:09:27,915
Configure!

790
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:29,583
<i>Fire!</i>

791
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:32,217
No. What is it?

792
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,400
It was the Republic.

793
01:10:50,685 --> 01:10:52,080
The First Order.
They've done it.

794
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:55,724
Where is Rey?

795
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:14,524
What are you doing?

796
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:17,928
You have to go back.

797
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:19,624
I'm leaving.

798
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:21,512
BB-8

799
01:11:22,558 --> 01:11:24,811
You can't. You have to go back,
you're too important.

800
01:11:25,437 --> 01:11:26,638
They will help you.

801
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,644
I've had this for ages.

802
01:11:46,398 --> 01:11:47,945
Kept it locked away.

803
01:11:48,269 --> 01:11:49,269
Where'd you get that?

804
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:53,701
A good question.
For another time.

805
01:11:54,714 --> 01:11:57,432
Take it. Find your friend!

806
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:07,535
Those beasts. They're here.

807
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:34,266
<i>FN-417, hold position.</i>

808
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:37,660
Oh, safety.

809
01:13:03,503 --> 01:13:04,600
<i>Sir.</i>

810
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,070
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.
With a girl.</i>

811
01:13:12,461 --> 01:13:14,783
You have to keep going,
Stay out of sight.

812
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:16,888
I'll try to fight them off.

813
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:19,208
I hope so too.

814
01:13:31,634 --> 01:13:32,978
Come on, Chewie!

815
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,295
Rey and BB-8! They need you!
Now! Go!

816
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:41,259
I need a weapon!

817
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:42,831
You have one!

818
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,504
Can I try that?

819
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,024
I like this thing.

820
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,040
<i>Traitor!</i>

821
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:55,830
You okay, Big Deal?

822
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:56,933
Thanks.

823
01:14:56,934 --> 01:14:57,934
<i>Don't move!</i>

824
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:02,129
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

825
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:09,513
<i>We have incoming in 28.6.</i>

826
01:15:09,814 --> 01:15:11,413
<i>Move it! Move it!</i>

827
01:15:12,412 --> 01:15:15,024
<i>Deploy all squads,
repeat, scramble all squads!</i>

828
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:17,407
<i>Get to your cover
and seek new positions!</i>

829
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:21,606
It's the Resistance.

830
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,892
Straight ahead.
Don't let these guys scare you.

831
01:15:32,173 --> 01:15:33,573
<i>- Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe</i>.

832
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:03,111
Quick!

833
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,685
Yeah!

834
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:35,951
That's one hell of a pilot!

835
01:17:31,886 --> 01:17:34,073
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

836
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,927
The droid.

837
01:17:50,075 --> 01:17:51,075
Where is it?

838
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:57,817
<i>Requesting air support.</i>

839
01:18:05,408 --> 01:18:06,531
<i>The map.</i>

840
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,239
<i>You have seen it.</i>

841
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,348
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

842
01:18:14,006 --> 01:18:15,805
<i>We need more troops.</i>

843
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,004
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

844
01:18:17,946 --> 01:18:21,005
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

845
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:28,950
<i>Get back into the trees!</i>

846
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,570
<i>No!</i>

847
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:50,987
No no!

848
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:54,990
Don't! Don't!

849
01:18:56,796 --> 01:18:57,796
Rey!

850
01:19:16,733 --> 01:19:18,917
He took her, did you see it?

851
01:19:19,869 --> 01:19:21,025
He took her. She's gone.

852
01:19:21,134 --> 01:19:22,467
Yeah, yeah, I know.

853
01:19:32,026 --> 01:19:33,026
Let's go.

854
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:47,862
Goodness!

855
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:51,871
Han Solo! It is I, C-3PO.

856
01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:54,904
You probably don't recognize
me because of the red arm.

857
01:19:55,016 --> 01:19:57,401
Look who it is,
Did you see who...?

858
01:20:02,059 --> 01:20:04,792
Excuse me, Prince ... General.
I'm sorry.

859
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,490
Come BB-8, quickly.

860
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:10,111
Yes, I must get my
proper arm reinstalled.

861
01:20:11,972 --> 01:20:13,308
You changed your hair.

862
01:20:15,986 --> 01:20:17,313
The same jacket.

863
01:20:18,503 --> 01:20:20,411
No, new jacket.

864
01:20:33,557 --> 01:20:34,640
I saw him.

865
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:38,064
Leia, I saw our son.

866
01:20:40,386 --> 01:20:41,386
He was here.

867
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,252
Hey!

868
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,424
BB-8, my friend.

869
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,776
Good to see you.

870
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:34,088
Finn saved you?
Where is?

871
01:21:34,197 --> 01:21:35,197
Poe?

872
01:21:37,124 --> 01:21:38,124
Oh no.

873
01:21:38,168 --> 01:21:39,827
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

874
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:42,688
- So are you!
- What happened to you?

875
01:21:42,762 --> 01:21:45,844
What happened? I got thrown from the crash and I
woke up at night and no you, no ship, no nothing.

876
01:21:45,856 --> 01:21:47,328
BB-8 says that you saved him.

877
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,749
No, no. It wasn't just me.

878
01:21:48,819 --> 01:21:51,667
You completed my mission, Finn...
That's my jacket.

879
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:53,659
No no no no.

880
01:21:53,805 --> 01:21:55,572
Keep it. It suits you.

881
01:21:56,896 --> 01:21:58,896
You're a good man, Finn.

882
01:21:59,538 --> 01:22:01,111
Poe, I need your help.

883
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:05,455
<i>PZ-4CO, report to
communications.</i>

884
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:10,146
General Organa

885
01:22:11,568 --> 01:22:13,981
Sorry to interrupt.
This is Finn.

886
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:14,925
He needs to talk to you.

887
01:22:15,043 --> 01:22:16,528
And I need to talk to him.

888
01:22:16,607 --> 01:22:18,621
That was incredibly brave what you did.

889
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,080
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

890
01:22:21,195 --> 01:22:23,204
Thank you ma'am.
But a friend of mine was taken prisoner.

891
01:22:23,315 --> 01:22:24,792
Han told me about the girl.

892
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:26,320
I'm sorry.

893
01:22:26,428 --> 01:22:28,700
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian System.

894
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:29,861
He worked on the base.

895
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:32,171
We're desperate for
anything you can tell us.

896
01:22:32,282 --> 01:22:34,694
That's where my friend was taken.
I've got to get there fast.

897
01:22:34,848 --> 01:22:38,748
And I will do everything I can to help,
but first you need to tell us all you know.

898
01:22:42,005 --> 01:22:43,297
That sounds very scary.

899
01:22:45,686 --> 01:22:47,519
You must be so brave.

900
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,377
General...

901
01:22:51,484 --> 01:22:56,097
I regret to inform you that the map recovered
from BB-8 is only partially complete.

902
01:22:56,244 --> 01:23:00,247
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

903
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:04,096
We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

904
01:23:04,273 --> 01:23:08,195
I can't believe I was so foolish to think
I could find Luke home and bring him home.

905
01:23:08,419 --> 01:23:09,121
Leia.

906
01:23:09,222 --> 01:23:10,659
Don't do that.

907
01:23:10,773 --> 01:23:11,613
Do what?

908
01:23:11,761 --> 01:23:12,845
Anything.

909
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:15,510
Princesses.

910
01:23:16,736 --> 01:23:18,254
I'm trying to be helpful.

911
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:21,754
When did that ever help?
And don't say the Death Star.

912
01:23:37,355 --> 01:23:38,355
BB-8.

913
01:23:38,383 --> 01:23:40,116
You're wasting your time.

914
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:44,428
It is very doubtful that R2 would have
the rest of the map in his backup.

915
01:23:45,773 --> 01:23:46,783
I am afraid not.

916
01:23:46,894 --> 01:23:50,962
R2-D2 has been in low power
mode Master Luke went away.

917
01:23:53,535 --> 01:23:56,529
Sadly, he may never be his own self again.

918
01:23:58,305 --> 01:23:59,669
Listen to me, will you?

919
01:24:01,373 --> 01:24:02,598
I know every time you...

920
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:08,081
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

921
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:09,818
You think I want to forget him?

922
01:24:09,964 --> 01:24:11,831
I want him back.

923
01:24:11,942 --> 01:24:13,919
There's nothing more we could have done.

924
01:24:15,869 --> 01:24:17,209
There's too much Vader in him.

925
01:24:17,354 --> 01:24:19,581
That's why I wanted
him to train with Luke.

926
01:24:20,557 --> 01:24:23,188
I just never should have sent him away.
That's when I lost him.

927
01:24:24,891 --> 01:24:26,724
That's when I lost you both.

928
01:24:29,028 --> 01:24:31,770
We both had to deal
with it in our own way.

929
01:24:32,893 --> 01:24:35,407
I went back to the only
thing I was ever any good at.

930
01:24:36,391 --> 01:24:37,438
We both did.

931
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:42,268
We lost our son.
Forever.

932
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,805
No.

933
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,442
It was Snoke.

934
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:48,332
He seduced our son to the dark side.

935
01:24:48,442 --> 01:24:50,391
But we can still save him.

936
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:51,999
Me...

937
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:54,201
You.

938
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,800
If Luke couldn't reach him,
How could I?

939
01:24:57,372 --> 01:24:58,560
Luke is a Jedi.

940
01:25:00,404 --> 01:25:01,404
You're his father.

941
01:25:04,774 --> 01:25:07,384
There's still light in him,
I know it.

942
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:12,564
General, the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

943
01:25:39,299 --> 01:25:40,299
Where I am?

944
01:25:42,295 --> 01:25:43,775
<i>You are my guest.</i>

945
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:45,287
Where are the others?

946
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:50,084
<i>You mean the murderers, traitors
and thieves you call friends?</i>

947
01:25:51,178 --> 01:25:53,308
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

948
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:57,384
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

949
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:01,466
That happens when you're being
hunted by a creature in a mask.

950
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:28,307
Tell me about the droid.

951
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:33,105
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

952
01:26:33,181 --> 01:26:35,051
He's carrying a section of navigation chart.

953
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:36,558
And we have the rest.

954
01:26:36,668 --> 01:26:39,589
Recovered from the archives of the Empire,
but we need the last piece.

955
01:26:39,698 --> 01:26:42,058
Somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

956
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:44,703
You.

957
01:26:46,049 --> 01:26:47,381
A scavenger.

958
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:51,573
You know I can take
whatever I want.

959
01:26:57,851 --> 01:26:59,585
You are so lonely.

960
01:27:02,004 --> 01:27:03,333
So afraid to leave.

961
01:27:07,818 --> 01:27:10,484
At night,
desperate to sleep.

962
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:15,034
Imagine an ocean.

963
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:17,311
I see.

964
01:27:18,952 --> 01:27:20,428
I see the island.

965
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,464
And Han Solo.

966
01:27:28,892 --> 01:27:30,696
You feel like he's the
father you never had.

967
01:27:31,544 --> 01:27:32,671
He would have disappointed you.

968
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:34,300
Get out of my head.

969
01:27:35,223 --> 01:27:36,805
I know you've seen the map.

970
01:27:38,515 --> 01:27:39,702
It's in there.

971
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:41,945
And now you'll give me.

972
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,225
Don't be afraid.
I feel it too.

973
01:27:55,184 --> 01:27:57,371
I'm not giving you anything.

974
01:27:58,171 --> 01:27:59,171
We'll see.

975
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,390
You.

976
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,449
You're afraid.

977
01:28:45,131 --> 01:28:48,401
That you'll never be as
strong as Darth Vader.

978
01:28:57,331 --> 01:28:59,257
<i>The scavenger.</i>

979
01:28:59,619 --> 01:29:00,949
Resisted you?

980
01:29:01,065 --> 01:29:02,654
She is strong with the Force.

981
01:29:02,678 --> 01:29:04,678
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

982
01:29:04,826 --> 01:29:05,826
And the droid?

983
01:29:05,879 --> 01:29:08,766
Ren believed it was no valuable to us.

984
01:29:09,494 --> 01:29:11,806
That the girl was all we needed.

985
01:29:11,951 --> 01:29:15,907
As a result, the Droid has most likely
been returned to the hands of the enemy.

986
01:29:15,986 --> 01:29:17,210
They may have the map already.

987
01:29:17,356 --> 01:29:19,451
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed

988
01:29:19,567 --> 01:29:21,299
before they get to Skywalker.

989
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:22,957
We have their location.

990
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:26,274
We tracked their reconnaissance
ship to the Illenium system.

991
01:29:27,006 --> 01:29:28,006
Good.

992
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,339
Then we will crush
them once and for all.

993
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:32,857
Prepare the weapon.

994
01:29:33,797 --> 01:29:36,168
Supreme Leader,
I can get the map from the girl.

995
01:29:36,242 --> 01:29:38,113
I just need your guidance.

996
01:29:39,861 --> 01:29:43,993
If what you say about this girl
It is true...

997
01:29:45,015 --> 01:29:48,918
Bring her to me.

998
01:30:03,597 --> 01:30:08,697
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

999
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:13,744
<i>What did you say?</i>

1000
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:19,968
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell

1001
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:21,386
with the door open.

1002
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:29,886
<i>I will tighten those restraints</i>

1003
01:30:30,032 --> 01:30:31,735
<i>scavenger scum.</i>

1004
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:50,251
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1005
01:30:53,872 --> 01:30:57,510
<i>I will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.</i>

1006
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:07,834
And you'll drop your weapon.

1007
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:09,667
<i>And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

1008
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:23,122
<i>No.</i>

1009
01:31:24,185 --> 01:31:25,185
<i>No.</i>

1010
01:31:26,908 --> 01:31:28,165
<i>Guards!</i>

1011
01:31:30,728 --> 01:31:31,728
<i>Guards!</i>

1012
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:38,428
Begin charging the weapon.

1013
01:31:39,038 --> 01:31:40,038
Yes sir.

1014
01:31:40,613 --> 01:31:41,620
Weapon charging.

1015
01:32:00,976 --> 01:32:04,424
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance
flight confirms Finn's report.

1016
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:08,248
They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed weapon
built within the planet itself.

1017
01:32:08,263 --> 01:32:09,193
A laser cannon?

1018
01:32:09,172 --> 01:32:10,983
We're not sure how to
describe a weapon of this scale.

1019
01:32:11,093 --> 01:32:12,092
It's another Death Star.

1020
01:32:12,209 --> 01:32:15,643
I wish that were the case, Major.
This was the Death Star.

1021
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:20,384
And this is Starkiller Base.

1022
01:32:21,126 --> 01:32:22,210
So it's big.

1023
01:32:22,325 --> 01:32:25,091
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1024
01:32:25,234 --> 01:32:27,720
It uses the power of the sun.

1025
01:32:28,665 --> 01:32:32,082
As the weapon is charged,
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1026
01:32:32,196 --> 01:32:33,196
Ma'am.

1027
01:32:35,024 --> 01:32:37,970
The First Order are charging
the weapon again now.

1028
01:32:38,949 --> 01:32:40,645
Our system is the next target.

1029
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:43,312
Oh my. Without the Republic
fleet, we're doomed.

1030
01:32:44,443 --> 01:32:45,601
How do we blow it up?

1031
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,694
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1032
01:32:47,709 --> 01:32:50,897
In order for that amount of
power to be contained

1033
01:32:50,909 --> 01:32:53,079
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1034
01:32:53,153 --> 01:32:55,311
There's one. Precinct 47.

1035
01:32:55,423 --> 01:32:56,437
Here.

1036
01:32:56,761 --> 01:32:59,027
If we can destroy that oscillator

1037
01:32:59,136 --> 01:33:02,306
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1038
01:33:02,321 --> 01:33:03,628
Maybe the planet.

1039
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:05,671
We'll go in and we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1040
01:33:05,822 --> 01:33:09,032
They have defensive shields
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1041
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:10,800
We disable the shields.

1042
01:33:10,852 --> 01:33:12,150
Kid, you worked there.

1043
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:13,346
What do you got?

1044
01:33:13,493 --> 01:33:14,493
I can do it.

1045
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:15,921
I like this guy.

1046
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:19,118
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there. On the planet.

1047
01:33:19,617 --> 01:33:21,340
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1048
01:33:21,823 --> 01:33:23,601
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1049
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,262
So we disable the shields,

1050
01:33:25,373 --> 01:33:27,967
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up the big gun.

1051
01:33:29,306 --> 01:33:30,306
All right. Let's go.

1052
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:54,944
Chewie, check the thermal capitador.
Come on. Let's go.

1053
01:33:55,782 --> 01:33:58,048
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1054
01:33:58,121 --> 01:33:59,121
Now you tell me?

1055
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:01,498
You know?
No matter how much we faught

1056
01:34:03,663 --> 01:34:05,442
I always hated watching you leave.

1057
01:34:06,351 --> 01:34:07,399
That's why I did it.

1058
01:34:08,674 --> 01:34:10,172
So you'd miss me.

1059
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:14,175
I did miss you.

1060
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,859
Wasn't all was bad, was it?
Huh?

1061
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:20,996
Some of it was...

1062
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:22,963
Good.

1063
01:34:22,964 --> 01:34:23,964
Pretty good.

1064
01:34:27,465 --> 01:34:29,485
Some things never change.

1065
01:34:29,594 --> 01:34:30,594
True.

1066
01:34:31,068 --> 01:34:32,654
You still drive me crazy.

1067
01:34:42,535 --> 01:34:43,747
If you see our son,

1068
01:34:46,646 --> 01:34:48,084
bring him home.

1069
01:34:53,879 --> 01:34:57,827
<i>Sir, sensors triggered in Hangar 718.
We're searching the area.</i>

1070
01:34:58,594 --> 01:34:59,973
<i>She is just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1071
01:35:00,085 --> 01:35:03,944
<i>The longer it takes to find her,
most dangerous she becomes.</i>

1072
01:35:18,816 --> 01:35:20,110
How are we getting in?

1073
01:35:20,224 --> 01:35:22,606
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate.

1074
01:35:22,714 --> 01:35:25,194
Keeps anything travelling slower than
lightspeed from getting through.

1075
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:28,163
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1076
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:30,434
Chewie, get ready.

1077
01:35:32,063 --> 01:35:33,121
And now!

1078
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:38,740
I am pulling up!

1079
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:47,793
If I get any higher, they'll see us!

1080
01:36:09,968 --> 01:36:14,081
Sir, she was not found in hangar 718.
But all troops are on alert.

1081
01:36:14,192 --> 01:36:17,816
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.
She's going to try to steal a ship to escape.</i>

1082
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:20,872
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1083
01:36:32,648 --> 01:36:34,144
The flooding tunnel
is over that ridge.

1084
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:35,525
We'll get in that way.

1085
01:36:35,598 --> 01:36:37,443
What was your job
when you were based here?

1086
01:36:37,556 --> 01:36:38,639
Sanitation.

1087
01:36:41,562 --> 01:36:42,562
Sanitation?

1088
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:45,206
Then how do you know
to disable the shields?

1089
01:36:45,318 --> 01:36:46,082
I don't.

1090
01:36:46,196 --> 01:36:47,780
I'm just here to get Rey.

1091
01:36:47,889 --> 01:36:51,708
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1092
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:53,506
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1093
01:36:54,028 --> 01:36:55,249
We will use the Force.

1094
01:36:55,395 --> 01:36:57,517
That's not how the Force works!

1095
01:36:59,183 --> 01:37:00,629
Oh really? You're cold?

1096
01:37:01,239 --> 01:37:02,239
Come on.

1097
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:11,450
Report.

1098
01:37:12,129 --> 01:37:13,961
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1099
01:37:16,232 --> 01:37:17,232
<i>Hey!</i>

1100
01:37:20,604 --> 01:37:22,810
The longer we're here,
the less luck we're gonna have.

1101
01:37:22,883 --> 01:37:23,649
Shields.

1102
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,947
I have an idea about that.

1103
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:34,105
Remember me?

1104
01:37:34,322 --> 01:37:35,778
<i>FN-2187</i>

1105
01:37:35,853 --> 01:37:38,670
Not anymore.
My name is Finn and I'm in charge.

1106
01:37:38,745 --> 01:37:40,845
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1107
01:37:40,916 --> 01:37:41,749
Bring it down.

1108
01:37:41,826 --> 01:37:42,624
Yeah.

1109
01:37:42,701 --> 01:37:44,003
Follow me.

1110
01:37:57,408 --> 01:37:58,448
<i>Have you seen the new T-17s?</i>

1111
01:37:58,544 --> 01:38:01,718
<i>The T-17s, as far as I know,
they are a great improvement.</i>

1112
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:05,001
<i>Yes. That's what they say.
But believe me, I can't stand.</i>

1113
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:06,482
- Do not?
- Do not.

1114
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:44,906
You want me to blast that bucket
off your head? Lower the shields.

1115
01:38:45,015 --> 01:38:47,105
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1116
01:38:47,175 --> 01:38:48,175
Do it.

1117
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:56,713
Solo if this works, we're not going to
have a lot of time to find Rey.

1118
01:38:57,073 --> 01:38:58,194
Don't worry, kid.

1119
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:00,852
We won't leave here without her.

1120
01:39:02,522 --> 01:39:05,217
<i>You can't be so stupid just
to think that this will be easy.</i>

1121
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:08,130
<i>My troops will storm this
block and kill you both.</i>

1122
01:39:08,243 --> 01:39:10,067
I disagree. What we do with her?

1123
01:39:10,641 --> 01:39:11,935
Is there a garbage chute?

1124
01:39:13,026 --> 01:39:14,067
Trash compactor?

1125
01:39:14,999 --> 01:39:15,999
Yeah, there is.

1126
01:39:16,521 --> 01:39:18,211
General,
their shields are down.

1127
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,553
Thank the Maker!

1128
01:39:19,664 --> 01:39:21,647
Han did it. Send them in.

1129
01:39:21,756 --> 01:39:23,555
Give Poe full
authorization for attack.

1130
01:39:23,664 --> 01:39:25,942
Black leader,
go to sub-light speed.

1131
01:39:26,092 --> 01:39:28,713
Roger base.
Red squad, Blue squads, take my lead.

1132
01:39:29,846 --> 01:39:30,966
Dropping out of light speed.

1133
01:39:44,927 --> 01:39:46,291
<i>Almost in range.</i>

1134
01:39:46,405 --> 01:39:49,361
Leave the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1135
01:39:49,473 --> 01:39:50,529
Approaching target.

1136
01:39:55,205 --> 01:39:56,315
Fighters incoming!

1137
01:39:57,195 --> 01:39:58,886
<i>Arriving at 28.336</i>

1138
01:39:59,272 --> 01:40:01,285
4. 5! Shields up!

1139
01:40:01,396 --> 01:40:02,733
Dispatch all squadrons.

1140
01:40:02,842 --> 01:40:03,842
Yes, General.

1141
01:40:05,211 --> 01:40:06,211
All right. Fire it up.

1142
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:16,773
Direct hit.

1143
01:40:16,846 --> 01:40:17,970
But no damage!

1144
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,701
<i>Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it.</i>

1145
01:40:19,808 --> 01:40:20,808
Another bombing run.

1146
01:40:20,906 --> 01:40:23,714
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone,
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1147
01:40:23,823 --> 01:40:26,020
But as long as there's light,
We got a chance.

1148
01:40:28,017 --> 01:40:29,592
Guys, we got
a lot of company!

1149
01:40:36,127 --> 01:40:37,967
<i>We believe they
may be splitting up.</i>

1150
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:39,766
<i>Heading to the quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1151
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,736
We use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1152
01:40:49,844 --> 01:40:52,471
I'lll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need the cover.

1153
01:40:52,617 --> 01:40:53,776
You sure you're up for this?

1154
01:40:53,885 --> 01:40:54,885
Hell, no.

1155
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:57,601
I'll go in and try to find Rey.
The troopers will be off our tail.

1156
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:59,683
We have to be
ready for that.

1157
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:01,671
Oh, there's an access
tunnel that leads...

1158
01:41:01,821 --> 01:41:04,453
Why are you doing that? Hm?
Why are you doing this?

1159
01:41:04,567 --> 01:41:05,847
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1160
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,440
You all right?

1161
01:41:23,898 --> 01:41:24,753
Yeah.

1162
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,730
All right.

1163
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:27,385
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1164
01:41:27,497 --> 01:41:28,686
Finn, what are you doing here?

1165
01:41:28,799 --> 01:41:30,100
We came back for you.

1166
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:32,890
What did he say?

1167
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:34,776
That was your idea.

1168
01:41:38,665 --> 01:41:39,913
Thank you.

1169
01:41:43,957 --> 01:41:44,987
How did you get away?

1170
01:41:45,718 --> 01:41:46,718
I can't explain it.

1171
01:41:46,766 --> 01:41:48,061
And you would't believe it.

1172
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:50,946
Escape now,
hug later.

1173
01:42:06,171 --> 01:42:07,363
I got one behind me.

1174
01:42:08,141 --> 01:42:09,301
<i>- You see it?
- Yeah. I'm on it</i>.

1175
01:42:17,805 --> 01:42:18,559
Burillo's been hit.

1176
01:42:18,636 --> 01:42:19,996
Watch out for ground fire.

1177
01:42:24,964 --> 01:42:27,635
We're in trouble.
We can't leave.

1178
01:42:29,954 --> 01:42:32,431
My friend's got a bag
filled with explosives.

1179
01:42:33,308 --> 01:42:34,493
Let's use them.

1180
01:42:34,604 --> 01:42:36,117
General, are you seeing this?

1181
01:42:36,225 --> 01:42:37,505
Two more X-wings down.

1182
01:42:37,614 --> 01:42:39,569
That's half our
fleet destroyed.

1183
01:42:39,715 --> 01:42:42,810
And their weapon will be fully
charged in 10 minutes.

1184
01:42:42,999 --> 01:42:45,040
It would take a
miracle to save us now.

1185
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,321
That girl knows her stuff.

1186
01:43:23,855 --> 01:43:25,748
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1187
01:43:27,859 --> 01:43:29,411
You're right.
That's a better idea.

1188
01:43:29,519 --> 01:43:31,463
You take the top,
I'll go down below.

1189
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:32,557
Detonator.

1190
01:43:33,402 --> 01:43:34,561
We'll meet back here.

1191
01:44:20,389 --> 01:44:21,461
<i>Find them.</i>

1192
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:24,030
Ben!

1193
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:37,729
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1194
01:45:38,635 --> 01:45:41,120
<i>I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.</i>

1195
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:03,806
Take off that mask.
You don't need it.

1196
01:46:04,827 --> 01:46:06,525
<i>What do you think you will see if I do?</i>

1197
01:46:06,632 --> 01:46:08,854
The face of my son.

1198
01:46:30,792 --> 01:46:32,699
Your son is gone.

1199
01:46:34,546 --> 01:46:36,523
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1200
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:38,404
So I destroyed him.

1201
01:46:40,445 --> 01:46:42,933
That's what Snoke
wants you to believe.

1202
01:46:44,052 --> 01:46:45,707
But it's not true.

1203
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:49,202
My son is alive.

1204
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:50,648
No.

1205
01:46:50,759 --> 01:46:52,929
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1206
01:46:53,078 --> 01:46:55,276
Snoke is using you for your power.

1207
01:46:56,187 --> 01:46:58,414
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1208
01:47:03,423 --> 01:47:04,826
You know it's true.

1209
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,660
It's too late.

1210
01:47:11,735 --> 01:47:15,124
No, it's not.
Leave here with me. Come home.

1211
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:18,083
We miss you.

1212
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:28,624
I'm being torn apart.

1213
01:47:31,886 --> 01:47:33,652
I want to be
free of this pain.

1214
01:47:39,424 --> 01:47:42,600
I know what I have to do,
but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.

1215
01:47:46,472 --> 01:47:47,807
Will you help me?

1216
01:47:47,916 --> 01:47:50,424
Yes. Anything.

1217
01:48:39,865 --> 01:48:40,865
No!

1218
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:49,007
Thank you.

1219
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:14,133
The oscillator has been damaged

1220
01:50:14,245 --> 01:50:15,761
but it is still functional.

1221
01:50:15,877 --> 01:50:18,555
Admiral, the weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1222
01:50:29,894 --> 01:50:30,928
<i>The Hawk is this way.</i>

1223
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,369
We're not done yet.

1224
01:50:56,825 --> 01:50:58,158
You're a monster.

1225
01:50:58,695 --> 01:51:00,277
It's just us now.

1226
01:51:01,769 --> 01:51:03,255
Han Solo can't save you.

1227
01:51:12,919 --> 01:51:13,919
Rey!

1228
01:51:16,882 --> 01:51:18,714
Rey. Rey!

1229
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:23,330
Oh no. No no. Rey.

1230
01:51:26,296 --> 01:51:27,302
Traitor!

1231
01:51:37,502 --> 01:51:39,481
That lightsaber.

1232
01:51:40,822 --> 01:51:41,612
It belongs to me.

1233
01:51:41,763 --> 01:51:43,377
Come get it.

1234
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:32,491
We just lost
Star-1.

1235
01:53:33,029 --> 01:53:34,110
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1236
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:35,821
What do we do?
It isn't working.

1237
01:53:36,206 --> 01:53:39,026
Black leader, there's a brand
new hole in the oscillator.

1238
01:53:39,537 --> 01:53:40,937
<i>Looks like our friends got here.</i>

1239
01:53:41,852 --> 01:53:44,051
Red-4, Red-6, Cover us.

1240
01:53:44,161 --> 01:53:45,336
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1241
01:53:45,441 --> 01:53:48,143
Everybody else, hit the target hard.
Give it everything you got.

1242
01:54:00,953 --> 01:54:02,319
I need some help here.
I need help!

1243
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:03,663
- I'm here!
- Watch out!

1244
01:54:04,644 --> 01:54:05,644
They got me!

1245
01:54:11,343 --> 01:54:12,206
All teams

1246
01:54:12,314 --> 01:54:14,583
<i>I'm going in.
Pull up and cover me.</i>

1247
01:54:14,657 --> 01:54:16,793
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1248
01:54:22,675 --> 01:54:24,939
The weapon will be fully
charged in 30 seconds.

1249
01:54:25,897 --> 01:54:27,101
Prepare to fire.

1250
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:01,623
You need a teacher.

1251
01:56:03,491 --> 01:56:05,439
I could show you
the ways of the Force.

1252
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,840
The Force?

1253
01:58:02,711 --> 01:58:04,905
Lieutenant! Get back to your station!

1254
01:58:04,993 --> 01:58:08,086
Just look! We won't survive this.
Even Hux has gone.

1255
01:58:08,194 --> 01:58:09,426
Supreme Leader.

1256
01:58:10,684 --> 01:58:12,300
The fuel cells erupted.

1257
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:14,947
The collapse of the
planet has begun.

1258
01:58:15,009 --> 01:58:19,150
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1259
01:58:20,543 --> 01:58:24,464
It is time to complete
his training.

1260
01:58:27,081 --> 01:58:28,081
Finn!

1261
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:29,418
Finn.

1262
01:59:19,055 --> 01:59:20,073
All teams

1263
01:59:20,186 --> 01:59:21,210
<i>I'm got eyes on them.</i>

1264
01:59:21,282 --> 01:59:22,282
Yes!

1265
01:59:45,376 --> 01:59:48,077
Our job's done here.
Let's go home.

1266
01:59:59,408 --> 02:00:01,248
Easy. He's hurt.

1267
02:00:01,903 --> 02:00:02,903
Get a heartbeat.

1268
02:01:05,693 --> 02:01:06,957
R2-D2!

1269
02:01:07,069 --> 02:01:08,553
You've come back.

1270
02:01:12,346 --> 02:01:13,472
You found what?

1271
02:01:13,856 --> 02:01:15,579
How dare you call me that!

1272
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:20,007
Find the Master Luke.
How?

1273
02:01:20,702 --> 02:01:23,759
Come R2. We must go
tell the others at once!

1274
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:25,856
General.

1275
02:01:25,965 --> 02:01:27,777
Excuse me, General.

1276
02:01:32,823 --> 02:01:35,779
R2-D2 may contain some
much needed good news.

1277
02:01:35,931 --> 02:01:37,006
Tell me.

1278
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:49,089
Alright buddy, hold on.

1279
02:02:03,628 --> 02:02:05,758
The map it is complete.

1280
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:07,062
Luke.

1281
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:10,799
Oh my dear friend,
how I missed you.

1282
02:02:27,831 --> 02:02:29,525
We'll see each other again.

1283
02:02:30,004 --> 02:02:31,585
I believe that.

1284
02:02:40,145 --> 02:02:41,792
Thank you my friend.

1285
02:02:56,777 --> 02:02:58,162
Rey.
