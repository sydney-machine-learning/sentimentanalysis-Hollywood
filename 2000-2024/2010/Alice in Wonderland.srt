1
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:17,056
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

2
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,924
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,125
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

4
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,098
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,965
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

6
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:28,127
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,732
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,113
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,816
I won't be long.

10
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,821
I'm falling down a dark hole,

11
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,326
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,828
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:05,466
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,635
I didn't know cats could smile.

15
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,935
Neither did I.

16
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,246
And there's a blue caterpillar.

17
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,979
Blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,779
Hmm.

19
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,550
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:31,657
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,699
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

22
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,366
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

23
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:45,346
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,677
Ow!

25
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,559
Must we go?

26
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,599
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

27
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,369
They will notice.

28
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,844
Where's your corset?

29
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,045
And no stockings.

30
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,418
I'm against them.

31
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,184
But you're not properly dressed.

32
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,749
Who's to say what is proper?

33
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:34,092
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

34
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,256
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.

35
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,062
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

36
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,434
Please, not today.

37
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,529
Father would have laughed.

38
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:50,569
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,105
Did you have bad dreams again?

40
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,581
Only one.

41
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,745
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

42
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,381
Do you think that's normal?

43
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't most people
have different dreams?

44
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,455
I don't know.

45
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,805
There. You're beautiful.

46
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,436
Now, can you manage a smile?

47
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,819
At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

48
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:43,798
Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

49
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,802
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

50
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,500
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

51
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,236
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!

52
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:02,578
Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

53
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,783
If only Charles were here...

54
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:07,980
My condolences.

55
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,822
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

56
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,993
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

57
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,526
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

58
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,342
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

59
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,812
Charles thought so, too.

60
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:51,699
Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

61
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,760
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

62
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,166
Do I amuse you?

63
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,303
No.

64
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,505
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

65
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,676
and the men wearing dresses.

66
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,651
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

67
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:14,155
When in doubt, remain silent.

68
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:25,564
Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.

69
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,326
Where's your head?

70
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:30,338
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

71
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,464
Why would you spend your time

72
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,736
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

73
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,107
Why wouldn't I?

74
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:38,443
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

75
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:39,606
before breakfast.

76
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:43,710
Come along.

77
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:50,085
Alice, meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes.

78
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:53,923
We have a secret to tell you.

79
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,022
If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

80
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,624
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.

81
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,794
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

82
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,805
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.

83
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,636
But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

84
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,268
- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.

85
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:09,937
I wonder if your mother knows

86
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,574
that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.

87
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,016
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.

88
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,247
There's your mother right now.

89
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:21,313
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.

90
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,552
You've ruined the surprise!

91
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,327
I could strangle them!

92
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,525
Everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret.

93
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,226
Does everyone know?

94
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,293
It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

95
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,400
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...

96
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:42,035
But I don't know
if I want to marry Hamish.

97
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:45,012
Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

98
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,447
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

99
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,486
You don't want to end up
like Aunt Imogene.

100
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:58,926
And you don't want to be a burden
on Mother, do you?

101
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,155
No.

102
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,494
So you'll marry Hamish.

103
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,329
You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,

104
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,857
and your life will be perfect.

105
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,525
It's already decided.

106
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,162
Alice, dear.

107
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,168
I'll leave you to it.

108
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,474
Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?

109
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,315
Do you know what I've always dreaded?

110
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,252
The decline of the aristocracy?

111
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:29,215
Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.

112
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,750
You're bound to produce
little... Imbeciles!

113
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,295
The gardeners have
planted white roses

114
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:36,593
when I specifically asked for red.

115
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,861
You could always paint the roses red.

116
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:41,028
What an odd thing to say.

117
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:45,537
You should know that my son
has extremely delicate digestion.

118
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,177
- Did you see that?
- See what?

119
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,875
- It was a rabbit, I think.
- Nasty things.

120
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,611
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.

121
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:59,781
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods,
he could get a blockage.

122
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,456
Did you see it that time?

123
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:03,822
- See what?
- The rabbit.

124
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:05,485
Don't shout.

125
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:09,827
Now, pay attention.
Hamish said you were easily distracted.

126
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,800
- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.

127
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,902
I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me.

128
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,612
Aunt Imogene.

129
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,707
I think I'm going mad.
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.

130
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:33,380
I can't be bothered
with your fancy rabbit now.

131
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,583
I'm waiting for my fiancé.

132
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,189
- You have a fiancé?
- Hmm.

133
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,293
There! Did you see it?

134
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,824
He's a prince.

135
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:50,429
But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.

136
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:52,838
It's tragic, isn't it?

137
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,337
Very.

138
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:05,584
Lowell?

139
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,456
Alice. We were just...

140
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,623
Hattie's an old friend.

141
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,652
I can see you're very close.

142
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,730
Look, you won't mention this
to your sister, will you?

143
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,133
I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.

144
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,334
Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.

145
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,501
You don't want to ruin her marriage,
do you?

146
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,635
Me?

147
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:33,271
But I'm not the one who's
sneaking around behind her back.

148
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,540
There you are.

149
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,993
Alice Kingsleigh...

150
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,594
Hamish.

151
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:53,359
What is it?

152
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,166
You have a caterpillar
on your shoulder.

153
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,165
Ew.

154
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,498
Don't hurt it.

155
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,181
You'll want to wash that finger.

156
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,249
Alice Kingsleigh,

157
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,693
will you be my wife?

158
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,596
Well,

159
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,930
everyone expects me to,

160
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,198
and you're a lord.

161
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:38,973
My face won't last,
and I don't want to end up like...

162
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,682
But this is happening so quickly. I...

163
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:48,680
I think I...

164
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,657
I think I...

165
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,831
I need a moment.

166
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,436
Hello.

167
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,391
It's only a dream.

168
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,534
You'd think she would
remember all this from the first time.

169
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,341
You've brought the wrong Alice.

170
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:39,279
McTWISP: No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.

171
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,495
She's the wrong Alice.

172
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:29,558
McTWISP: Give her a chance.

173
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,801
Curiouser and curiouser.

174
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,677
I told you she's the right Alice.

175
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,208
I am not convinced.

176
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,811
McTWISP: How is that for gratitude?

177
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,347
I've been up there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next,

178
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,689
and I was almost eaten
by other animals.

179
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,058
Can you imagine?

180
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:11,896
<i>They go about entirely unclothed,
and they do their shukm in public.</i>

181
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,669
- I had to avert my eyes.
- Doesn't look anything like herself.

182
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:17,069
That's because she's the wrong Alice.

183
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,903
- If she was, she might be.
- If she isn't, she ain't.

184
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:23,001
- But if she were so, she would be.
- But she isn't, nohow.

185
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:26,344
How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?

186
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:29,374
And who are you, if I might ask?

187
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,079
Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.

188
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,178
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.

189
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:34,917
We should consult Absolem.

190
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,356
Exactly. Absolem will know who she is.

191
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,883
- I'll escort you.
- Hey, it's not being your turn.

192
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,088
So unfair.

193
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,926
- Hey, leave off!
- Let go!

194
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,592
- Are they always this way?
- Family trait.

195
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,567
You can both escort her.

196
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,808
- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's absolute.

197
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,576
He's Absolem.

198
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,130
Who are you?

199
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:28,838
Absolem?

200
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:35,578
You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is, who are you?

201
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,414
Alice.

202
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:38,976
We shall see.

203
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:42,447
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.

204
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:48,326
Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.

205
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:59,468
The Oraculum, being a calendrical
compendium of Underland.

206
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,813
- It's a calendar.
- Compendium.

207
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:10,807
It tells of each and every day
since the Beginning.

208
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,756
Today is Griblig Day
in the time of the Red Queen.

209
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:21,028
Show her the Frabjous Day.

210
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:24,655
Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the day
you slay the Jabberwocky.

211
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,394
Sorry? Slay a what?

212
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh, yeah. That being you, there,
with the Vorpal sword.

213
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:34,208
No other swords can kill
the Jabberwocky, nohow.

214
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,836
If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.

215
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,878
That's not me!

216
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:40,244
I know!

217
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,818
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?

218
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:47,048
Not hardly.

219
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,950
- I told you.
- McTWISP: - Oh, dear.

220
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,895
- I said so.
- I said so.

221
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,555
Contrariwise,
you said she might be.

222
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,531
No, you said she would be if she was.

223
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,560
Little impostor. Pretending
to be Alice. She should be ashamed.

224
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,571
I was so certain of you.

225
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,665
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be the wrong Alice.

226
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:11,674
Wait, this is my dream.

227
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:15,574
I'm going to wake up now
and you'll all disappear.

228
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:26,251
That's odd.
Pinching usually does the trick.

229
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,595
I could stick you, if that would help.

230
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,889
- It might, actually. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

231
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:33,593
Ow!

232
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,269
- Bandersnatch!
- Bandersnatch!

233
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:30,219
Wait.

234
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:36,155
It's only a dream. Nothing can hurt me.

235
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,928
What's she doing?

236
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,661
Can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.

237
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,969
Run, you great lug!

238
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:58,676
This way, east to Queast.

239
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:00,271
No, south to Snud.

240
00:25:00,348 --> 00:25:01,872
No. No, no. This way.

241
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,398
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!

242
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,477
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

243
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,446
- Did you?
- No, Your Majesty.

244
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,972
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

245
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,884
Did you steal my tarts?

246
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,548
No, Your Majesty.

247
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:54,922
Squimberry juice.

248
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,028
- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to!
- Off with his head!

249
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,329
My family! Oh, please, please don't!

250
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,529
No! I have little ones to look after!

251
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,128
Go to his house
and collect the little ones.

252
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,504
I love tadpoles on toast
almost as much as I love caviar.

253
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,338
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,345
Drink!

255
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:19,750
Majesty?

256
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:27,661
Ilosovic Stayne, you knave,
where have you been lurking?

257
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,364
Majesty, I have found the Oraculum.

258
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,935
That? Looks so ordinary for an oracle.

259
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,670
Look here, on the Frabjous Day.

260
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,748
I'd know that tangled mess
of hair anywhere.

261
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,407
Is it Alice?

262
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,547
I believe it is.

263
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,721
What's she doing
with my darling Jabberwocky?

264
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,021
She appears to be slaying it.

265
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:01,091
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?

266
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:05,895
Not yet, but it will happen
if we don't stop her.

267
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,368
Find Alice, Stayne. Find her!

268
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:15,138
Find the scent of human girl
and earn your freedom.

269
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,608
For my wife and pups, as well?

270
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,682
Everyone will go home.

271
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:38,088
Dogs will believe anything.

272
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:15,631
It looks like you ran afoul of something
with wicked claws.

273
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,962
And I'm still dreaming.

274
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,974
What did that to you?

275
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,807
- Banner or Bander...
- The Bandersnatch?

276
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:26,579
Well, I'd better have a look.

277
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:28,345
What are you doing?

278
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:32,149
It needs to be purified
by someone with evaporating skills,

279
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,384
or it will fester and putrefy.

280
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:40,227
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.

281
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:43,196
At least let me bind it for you.

282
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:47,902
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

283
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,834
The Alice?

284
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:55,332
- There's been some debate about that.
- I never get involved in politics.

285
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,735
You'd best be on your way.

286
00:29:58,313 --> 00:30:02,340
What way? All I want to do is
wake up from this dream.

287
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,949
Fine.

288
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:08,614
Then I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.

289
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:18,530
Coming?

290
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:10,109
Watch what you're doing!

291
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,641
Hey, watch it!

292
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:16,581
Okay, okay. All right.

293
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,091
It's you.

294
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,721
No, it's not.
McTwisp brought us the wrong Alice.

295
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,424
It's the wrong Alice!

296
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,329
It's absolutely Alice.

297
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,335
You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.

298
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,337
I'd know him anywhere.

299
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,271
Well, as you can see,
we're still having tea.

300
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,110
And it's all because I was obliged
to kill Time waiting for your return.

301
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,980
You're terribly late, you know. Naughty.

302
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,145
Well, anyway, Time became
quite offended and stopped altogether.

303
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:47,711
Not a tick ever since.

304
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,049
- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.

305
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:54,060
Yes, yes, of course,
but now you're back, you see,

306
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:56,028
and we need to get on
to the Frabjous Day.

307
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,031
- Frabjous Day!
- Frabjous Day!

308
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:01,557
I'm investigating things
that begin with the letter "M."

309
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,804
Have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk?

310
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,670
<i>- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</i>

311
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,144
- What?
- Down with the Bloody Big Head,

312
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,670
the Bloody Big Head
being the Red Queen.

313
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:16,479
Come, come. We simply must
commence with the slaying and such.

314
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,485
Therefore, it is high time
to forgive and forget

315
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,487
or forget and forgive,
whichever comes first

316
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,820
or is, in any case, most convenient.
I'm waiting.

317
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,326
Hey.
It's tick-tick... It's ticking again.

318
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:30,855
All this talk of blood and slaying
has put me off my tea.

319
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:32,224
Ah.

320
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:38,265
The entire world is falling to ruin
and poor Chessur's off his tea.

321
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,507
What happened that day
was not my fault.

322
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:45,836
Oh, dear.

323
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,510
You ran out on them
to save your own skin,

324
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,585
<i>you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering</i>

325
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,780
<i>shukm juggling sluking urpal.</i>

326
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,550
<i>Bar lom muck egg brimni!</i>

327
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,887
Hatter!

328
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:00,120
- Thank you.
- Meow.

329
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:01,754
I'm fine.

330
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:05,265
What's wrong with you, Tarrant?
You used to be the life of the party.

331
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,359
You used to do the best Futterwacken
in all of Witzend.

332
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,701
- Futter what?
- Futterwacken!

333
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,864
It's a dance.

334
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,737
On the Frabjous Day,

335
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:19,372
when the White Queen
once again wears the crown,

336
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:25,375
on that day,
I shall Futterwacken vigorously.

337
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,720
Oh, no.

338
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:32,557
Uh-oh.

339
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,453
The Knave.

340
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,724
Goodbye.

341
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,926
Hide her!

342
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:40,661
Drink this quickly.

343
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,629
Quick! Hide her!

344
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,142
Oh, dear.

345
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:54,306
Aye.

346
00:33:56,651 --> 00:33:58,175
Mind your head.

347
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,426
Let me out!

348
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:22,368
Well, if it's not my favorite
trio of lunatics.

349
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:24,937
Would you like to join us?

350
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,138
You're all late for tea!

351
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,118
We're looking for the girl called Alice.

352
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,885
Speaking of the Queen, here is a little
song we used to sing in her honor.

353
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,087
<i>- Twinkle Twinkle little bat
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat</i>

354
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:46,293
<i>- How I wonder where you're at
- How I wonder where you're at</i>

355
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,302
<i>- Up a...
- Up a...</i>

356
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:52,500
If you're hiding her,
you'll lose your heads.

357
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,302
Already lost them.

358
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,041
All together now!

359
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,136
<i>- Up above the world you fly
- Up above the world you fly</i>

360
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,478
<i>- Like a tea tray in the sky
- Like a tea tray in the sky</i>

361
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,144
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle</i>

362
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,244
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle</i>

363
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,481
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...</i>

364
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,882
Oh!

365
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:16,559
<i>Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</i>

366
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,594
Would you like some cream?

367
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:28,940
- Would you like a slice of Battenberg?
- Follow the bloodhound.

368
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:31,941
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

369
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:36,014
- Oh, that's lovely.
- You're all mad.

370
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,047
Thanks very much.

371
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,684
Pass the scones, please.

372
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,092
- That one there.
- Oh! Pardon.

373
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,219
- Yes.
- Yep, aye.

374
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:49,729
One moment.

375
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,602
There. Yes.

376
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,638
Try this on for size.

377
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:09,479
Oh.

378
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:14,616
I like it.

379
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:18,318
Good thing the bloodhound
is one of us, or you'd be...

380
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,053
What do they want with me?

381
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,119
Wait a minute,
best take her to the White Queen.

382
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:24,892
She'll be safe there. Spoon...

383
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,001
Your carriage, milady.

384
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,497
- The hat?
- Of course.

385
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,437
Anyone can go by horse or rail,

386
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:38,571
but the absolute best way to travel
is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?

387
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,908
Oh, I love traveling by hat.

388
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,146
Mally. Just Alice, please.
Fairfarren, all.

389
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,614
What do you mean? Wait. Gae!

390
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:58,790
"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe

391
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:02,768
"All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe"

392
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,634
Sorry, what was that?

393
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:07,098
What was what?

394
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:15,046
"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Jaws that bite and claws that catch!

395
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:19,485
"'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
And the frumious Bandersnatch! '

396
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:26,617
"He took his Vorpal sword in hand
The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

397
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:31,963
"He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back"

398
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:36,634
It's all about you, you know.

399
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:41,500
I'm not slaying anything.
I don't slay, so put it out of your mind.

400
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,576
Mind.

401
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,721
Wait! You can't leave me here!

402
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,555
You don't slay.

403
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:05,223
Do you have any idea
what the Red Queen has done?

404
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:06,994
You don't slay.

405
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:09,595
I couldn't if I wanted to.

406
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,534
You're not the same
as you were before.

407
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:19,938
You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.

408
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,406
My "muchness"?

409
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:25,384
In there. Something's missing.

410
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,421
Tell me what Red Queen has done.

411
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:32,916
It's not a pretty story.

412
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,119
Tell me anyway.

413
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,538
It was here.

414
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:52,535
I was hatter to the White Queen
at the time.

415
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:57,047
Hightopp clan have always
been employed at court.

416
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:50,995
Hatter? Hatter!

417
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,565
I'm fine.

418
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:55,764
Are you?

419
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:01,871
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.

420
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:03,734
What?

421
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:06,379
Oh! Red Knights.

422
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:43,374
Go south to Trotter's Bottom.

423
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,977
The White Queen's castle
is just beyond.

424
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,714
Hold on tightly.

425
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,790
Down with the bloody Red Queen!

426
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,317
You were supposed to lead them away!
The Hatter trusted you!

427
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:59,485
They have my wife and pups.

428
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:02,325
- What's your name?
- Bayard.

429
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:03,821
Sit!

430
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,194
Would your name be Alice,
by any chance?

431
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:11,966
Yes, but I'm not the one
that everyone's talking about.

432
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,635
The Hatter would not have
given himself up just for any Alice.

433
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,337
Where did they take him?

434
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:20,745
To the Red Queen's castle
at Salazen Grum.

435
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:22,839
We're going to rescue him.

436
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:24,350
That is not foretold.

437
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:28,151
I don't care.
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.

438
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,850
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.

439
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,519
You must prepare
to meet the Jabberwocky.

440
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,494
From the moment
I fell down that rabbit hole,

441
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,362
I've been told what I must do
and who I must be.

442
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:42,358
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched
and stuffed into a teapot.

443
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:46,668
I've been accused of being Alice and
of not being Alice, but this is my dream.

444
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,868
I'll decide where it goes from here.

445
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:50,706
If you diverge from the path...

446
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:52,541
I make the path.

447
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,387
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don't forget the hat.

448
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:55,970
There's only one way across.

449
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:04,479
Lost my muchness, have I?

450
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,057
Bayard! The hat!

451
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,585
Your Majesty.

452
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:32,071
So sorry.

453
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,871
Splendid shot!

454
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:48,051
Where's my ball? Page!

455
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,589
I want to help you.

457
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,224
Well, if it isn't the wrong Alice.

458
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,428
What brings you here? Mmm?

459
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:07,133
I've come to rescue the Hatter.

460
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:09,903
You're not rescuing anyone
being the size of a gerbil.

461
00:47:09,943 --> 00:47:12,707
Well, do you have any more
of that cake that made me grow before?

462
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,715
Upelkuchen?
Actually, I might have some left.

463
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:26,817
Not all of it!

464
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:30,593
Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!

465
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:33,226
Page!

466
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:35,933
Oh, dear.

467
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,275
And what is this?

468
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,406
It... It's a "who," Majesty. This is, um...

469
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:49,974
Um?

470
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:53,076
From Umbradge.

471
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,315
What happened to your clothes?

472
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:59,587
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.

473
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:04,461
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.

474
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:07,797
So I've come to you, hoping you might
understand what it's like.

475
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:09,358
My dear girl,

476
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:12,997
anyone with a head that large
is welcome in my court.

477
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,302
Someone find her some clothes!

478
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:18,141
Use the curtains if you must,
but clothe this enormous girl.

479
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:29,316
I need a pig here!

480
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:38,125
I love a warm pig belly
for my aching feet.

481
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,895
- Would you like one, Um?
- No, thank you.

482
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:42,230
Sit!

483
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:45,866
Sit!

484
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,806
Go away.

485
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:57,007
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.

486
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:58,379
Fat boys!

487
00:49:00,787 --> 00:49:04,154
Oh. There they are.
Aren't they adorable?

488
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:08,025
They have the oddest way of speaking.
Speak, boys. Amuse us.

489
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,825
Go on.

490
00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:14,828
No.

491
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,028
Speak!

492
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:20,406
- Is that being...
- No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.

493
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,237
Contrariwise, I believe it's so.

494
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:24,334
No, it ain't so, nohow!

495
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,512
I love my fat boys. Now, get out.

496
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:41,551
- He did pinch me.
- He did pinch me.

497
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:03,979
And who is this lovely creature?

498
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,414
Um, my new favorite.

499
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:10,286
- Well, does she have a name?
- Um.

500
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:13,554
I believe your name
has slipped the Queen's mind.

501
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,652
Her name is Um, idiot!

502
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,159
From Umbradge.

503
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:20,824
Any luck with the prisoner?

504
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:22,459
He's stubborn.

505
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:26,634
You're too soft. Bring him!

506
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:53,097
We know Alice has returned
to Underland.

507
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,124
Do you know where she is?

508
00:50:57,104 --> 00:51:00,870
I've been considering things
that begin with the letter "M."

509
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:08,143
Moron, mutiny, murder, malice.

510
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,714
We're looking for an "A" word now.
Where is Alice?

511
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:16,153
Who, that wee little boy?
I wouldn't know.

512
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,383
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?

513
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:22,659
Stop that.

514
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,793
What a regrettably large head
you have.

515
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,994
I should very much like to hat it.

516
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:30,525
- Hat it?
- Yes.

517
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,435
I used to hat
the White Queen, you know.

518
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,338
Wasn't very much to work with,
poor dear.

519
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,172
Her head is so small.

520
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,911
It's tiny. It's a pimple of a head.

521
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,345
But this...

522
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:48,146
What I could do
with this monument, this orb...

523
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:53,524
Nay, this magnificently heroic globe.

524
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:58,859
What could you do?

525
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:02,531
Unbind him, Stayne.

526
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:05,765
How can he work
if his hands are bound?

527
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:17,273
Well, then,
shall it be a bonnet or a boater?

528
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:20,380
Or something for the boudoir?

529
00:52:21,188 --> 00:52:27,423
Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif,
snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke,

530
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:30,861
cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter,
billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau,

531
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,524
bongrace, fan-tail, night cap,
Garibaldi, fez...

532
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,794
Hatter.

533
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:35,392
Fez?

534
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:40,937
Leave us.

535
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,111
The trees seem sad.

536
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:58,157
- Have you been speaking with them?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:52:58,225 --> 00:53:00,284
Perhaps a bit more kindly.

538
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:06,559
Would you all excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.

539
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,778
- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.

540
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:24,642
- Where is she now?
- In Salazen Grum.

541
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:29,279
Forgive me. I allowed her
to divert from her destined path.

542
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:34,021
No, no, no, no. But that is exactly
where she will find the Vorpal sword.

543
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:38,525
We have our champion.
Rest now. You've done well.

544
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:59,316
Have you seen
a hat around here?

545
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:14,463
You must find Alice, Stayne.

546
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,559
Without the Jabberwocky,

547
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:18,900
my sister's followers
will surely rise against me.

548
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:23,037
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?

549
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:29,838
I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.

550
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,650
I know.

551
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,745
But Mirana can make anyone
fall in love with her.

552
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:36,982
Men, women,

553
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,991
even the furniture.

554
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:46,729
Even the King?

555
00:54:54,174 --> 00:54:56,938
I had to do it. He would have left me.

556
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:05,876
Majesty, is it not better
to be feared than loved?

557
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:09,919
Not certain anymore.

558
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:14,888
Oh, let her have the rabble.
I don't need them.

559
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,028
I have you.

560
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:38,310
They're wonderful.

561
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:42,450
You must let me try one on.

562
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:45,423
It is good to be working
at my trade again.

563
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,888
It's just a pity
you have to make them for her.

564
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,762
What is the hatter with me?

565
00:55:58,071 --> 00:55:59,299
Hatter?

566
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:11,613
Hatter.

567
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,854
Have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk?

568
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:19,688
I'm frightened, Alice.

569
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,087
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.

570
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:28,126
Have I gone mad?

571
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:36,170
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers.

572
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:41,711
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

573
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,649
Here.

574
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:56,858
That's better. You look yourself again.

575
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,729
Hat man!
Where are my hats?

576
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,496
I'm not a patient monarch!

577
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:06,096
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword
hidden in the castle.

578
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,037
The rabbit will help you.

579
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:11,339
Find it, Alice.
Take it to the White Queen.

580
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:13,311
We'll go to the White Queen together.

581
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:17,180
Why is it you're always too small
or too tall?

582
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:31,725
- Tweedles.
- Alice.

583
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:34,062
- How do you do, again?
- Where's the rabbit?

584
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:36,068
How is it you're being so great big?

585
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:38,297
She ain't great big,
this is how she normal is.

586
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,532
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.

587
00:57:40,573 --> 00:57:44,373
No, she drank the pishsalver
to get through the door, recall it?

588
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,502
Oh, yeah.

589
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,445
- Where's the rabbit?
- Over theres.

590
00:57:56,756 --> 00:57:59,350
- What are you doing here?
- I'm rescuing the Hatter.

591
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,859
I'm rescuing the Hatter.

592
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,694
He told me that the Vorpal sword
is hidden in the castle. Help me find it.

593
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,632
I don't take orders
from big, clumsy, galumphing...

594
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,792
Shoo!

595
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:16,534
- What is it, McTwisp?
- I know where the sword is.

596
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,141
The sword's hidden inside.

597
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,550
Be careful, Alice.

598
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:39,926
I know that smell.

599
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,243
I'm not going in there.

600
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:54,679
Look what that thing did to my arm.

601
00:58:54,747 --> 00:58:58,444
Dear, oh, dear.
Why haven't you mentioned this?

602
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:00,509
It wasn't this bad before.

603
00:59:16,169 --> 00:59:19,661
Hatter? Where are you?

604
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:22,803
Hatter?

605
00:59:23,743 --> 00:59:24,801
Mallymkun.

606
00:59:25,745 --> 00:59:28,145
Do you still have
the Bandersnatch eye?

607
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,546
Right here.

608
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,615
- I need it.
- Come and get it.

609
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,349
Hey! Give it back!

610
00:59:49,035 --> 00:59:50,593
I like you, Um.

611
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:54,667
I like largeness.

612
00:59:55,942 --> 00:59:57,671
Get away from me.

613
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:16,722
I have your eye.

614
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:30,761
No.

615
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,831
Hmm.

616
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:37,171
You look stunning in that hat.

617
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:39,074
Yes. Next.

618
01:01:42,982 --> 01:01:45,610
Your Majesty has never looked better.

619
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,780
Hmm. Another.

620
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:56,653
Oh!

621
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,489
I don't wish to alarm you,

622
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,161
but it smells as though
you might have dropped something.

623
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,976
Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.

624
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:28,025
Stayne!

625
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:24,672
I suppose this makes us even now.

626
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:06,591
Um forced herself on me.

627
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:13,122
I told her my heart belongs to you,
but she's obsessed with me.

628
01:04:18,905 --> 01:04:20,600
Off with her head!

629
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,770
Stand back, Mallymkun.

630
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:27,142
How's this for muchness?

631
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:28,908
No, no!
It mustn't be used for anything...

632
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:33,984
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!

633
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,084
Hatter!

634
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:40,322
- Take it to the White Queen.
- I'm not leaving without you.

635
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:41,587
Go!

636
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,747
Run, Alice!

637
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,153
Alice?

638
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:16,487
Run!

639
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:23,566
Seize her.

640
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:36,475
Alice.

641
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:40,015
Of course. Why didn't I see it?

642
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:45,752
Well, it has been a long time,
and you were such a little tyke then.

643
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:50,193
- Give me the sword.
- Stay back.

644
01:05:50,229 --> 01:05:52,356
The Queen will be so pleased.

645
01:05:52,398 --> 01:05:56,198
She will take great pleasure
in taking off your head.

646
01:06:16,856 --> 01:06:20,553
- Oh, Alice!
- Bayard! To Marmoreal.

647
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:32,062
Majesty, Alice has escaped

648
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:38,770
on the Bandersnatch,

649
01:06:41,213 --> 01:06:43,909
with the Vorpal sword.

650
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:49,317
How could you let this happen?

651
01:06:50,189 --> 01:06:55,889
I may have underestimated her,
but we have her conspirators,

652
01:06:56,295 --> 01:07:00,425
the Hatter and a dormouse.

653
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,464
Off with their heads!

654
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,451
Welcome to Marmoreal.

655
01:07:23,489 --> 01:07:25,650
I believe this belongs to you.

656
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:34,259
Mmm.

657
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:41,639
The Vorpal sword is home again.

658
01:07:44,076 --> 01:07:46,010
The armor is complete.

659
01:07:49,348 --> 01:07:52,476
Now all we need is a champion.

660
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:56,777
You're a little taller
than I thought you'd be.

661
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,188
Blame it on too much upelkuchen.

662
01:07:59,258 --> 01:08:00,520
Oh.

663
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,049
Come with me.

664
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,158
Is the March Hare here?

665
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:12,693
You're late
for your soup, you wee besom.

666
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:14,501
- You're late for your soup.
- Could use some salt.

667
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,701
Come here, you!

668
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:19,537
Give me that here.
Choppy, chop, chop, chop.

669
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:21,341
Leek and potato. Yes. That would be...

670
01:08:22,882 --> 01:08:26,340
Pishsalver. Let me think.

671
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:29,477
A pinch of worm fat,

672
01:08:31,323 --> 01:08:33,348
urine of the horsefly,

673
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:37,089
buttered fingers.

674
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:47,437
My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.

675
01:08:49,642 --> 01:08:52,270
Tell me, how does she seem to you?

676
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:54,039
Perfectly horrid.

677
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,708
- And her head?
- Bulbous.

678
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:03,881
I think she may have
some kind of growth in there,

679
01:09:03,923 --> 01:09:06,255
something pressing on her brain.

680
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:11,730
Three coins from a dead man's pocket,
two teaspoons of wishful thinking.

681
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:15,632
You can't imagine the things
that go on in that place.

682
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:17,066
Oh, yes, I can.

683
01:09:18,037 --> 01:09:22,974
But when a champion steps forth
to slay the Jabberwocky,

684
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:25,442
the people will rise against her.

685
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,075
That should do it.

686
01:09:33,519 --> 01:09:34,611
Blow.

687
01:09:49,068 --> 01:09:51,662
- Feel better?
- Much, thank you.

688
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:54,103
There's someone here
who would like to speak with you.

689
01:10:14,827 --> 01:10:17,261
- Absolem?
- Who are you?

690
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:26,271
I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.

691
01:10:26,772 --> 01:10:29,764
- How do you know?
- You said so yourself.

692
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,174
I said you were not hardly Alice,

693
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:33,802
but you're much more her now.

694
01:10:33,846 --> 01:10:36,781
In fact, you're almost Alice.

695
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,815
Even so,

696
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:41,786
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky
if my life depended on it.

697
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,349
It will.

698
01:10:44,456 --> 01:10:47,084
So I suggest
you keep the Vorpal sword on hand

699
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,889
when the Frabjous Day arrives.

700
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:51,657
You seem so real.

701
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,657
Sometimes I forget
that this is all a dream.

702
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,328
Will you stop doing that?

703
01:11:19,558 --> 01:11:22,026
I've always admired that hat.

704
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:25,158
Hello, Chess.

705
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:27,927
Since you won't be needing it
anymore,

706
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:32,202
would you consider
bequeathing it to me?

707
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:33,727
How dare you?

708
01:11:34,173 --> 01:11:38,109
It is a formal execution.
I would like to look my best, you know.

709
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,538
It is a pity about all this.

710
01:11:40,579 --> 01:11:43,776
I was looking forward
to seeing you Futterwacken.

711
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:46,848
I was rather good at it, was I not?

712
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,877
I really do love that hat.

713
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:54,224
I would wear it
to all the finest occasions.

714
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:04,095
I love a morning execution, don't you?

715
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:06,763
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

716
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:52,179
- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself.

717
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:55,353
As long as I can get at your neck.

718
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:59,120
I'm right behind you.

719
01:12:59,858 --> 01:13:01,018
Off with his head!

720
01:13:01,226 --> 01:13:02,750
I can't watch.

721
01:13:36,295 --> 01:13:38,195
Good morning, everyone.

722
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,121
Chess, you dog.

723
01:13:43,535 --> 01:13:44,661
Madam,

724
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,364
you are being heinously bamboozled

725
01:13:46,438 --> 01:13:50,067
by these lickspittle toadies
you surround yourselves with.

726
01:13:54,546 --> 01:13:55,638
What is that?

727
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,979
I'm not the only one, Majesty. Look!

728
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,007
A counterfeit nose.
You should be ashamed.

729
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:03,613
Me? What about that big belly
you're so proud of?

730
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:13,089
Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!

731
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,363
Off with their heads!

732
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:23,436
The abused and enslaved
in the Red Queen's court,

733
01:14:23,976 --> 01:14:26,501
all of you stand up and fight!

734
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:29,740
Rise up against the bloody Red Queen.

735
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:34,984
<i>- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</i>

736
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,618
Release the Jubjub Bird!

737
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:10,016
You're right, Stayne,

738
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:13,354
it is far better to be feared than loved.

739
01:15:17,462 --> 01:15:19,396
Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!

740
01:15:23,235 --> 01:15:24,395
Hatter!

741
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:27,269
Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on. Come on.

742
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:33,909
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.

743
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,917
I had hoped
to have a champion by now.

744
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,827
Why don't you slay
the Jabberwocky yourself?

745
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:53,592
You must have the power.

746
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,863
It is against my vows
to harm any living creature.

747
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:07,770
We have company.

748
01:16:17,623 --> 01:16:19,386
Have a look, Bayard.

749
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,658
Bielle.

750
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,801
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...

751
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,502
So did I. But they didn't,
and now here I am, still in one piece.

752
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:40,534
And I'm rather glad about that
now that I'm seeing you again.

753
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:42,341
I would have regretted
not seeing you again,

754
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:45,350
especially now that you're you,
and the proper size.

755
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,418
And it's a good size. It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!

756
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:52,355
- Hatter.
- Size. Fez. I'm fine.

757
01:16:52,424 --> 01:16:54,085
Where's your hat?

758
01:16:57,396 --> 01:16:58,693
Mmm.

759
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,493
- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?

760
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:04,696
All healed.

761
01:17:04,736 --> 01:17:07,398
Goodbye, sweet hat.

762
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:31,086
Have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk?

763
01:17:34,032 --> 01:17:36,023
Let me think about it.

764
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:39,963
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?

765
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,732
Frabjous Day. How could I forget?

766
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:48,640
Wish I'd wake up.

767
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:53,978
- Still believe this is a dream, do you?
- Of course.

768
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:57,915
This has all come from my own mind.

769
01:18:00,392 --> 01:18:03,828
Which would mean that I'm not real.

770
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:12,060
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.

771
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:16,101
I would dream up someone
who's half-mad.

772
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:20,572
Yes, yes. But you would have to be
half-mad to dream me up.

773
01:18:24,216 --> 01:18:25,877
I must be, then.

774
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,053
I'll miss you when I wake up.

775
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,176
Who will step forth to be champion
for the White Queen?

776
01:18:53,612 --> 01:18:55,443
That would be I.

777
01:18:57,082 --> 01:19:01,985
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.

778
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,212
I'll do it.

779
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:07,819
- No, me.
- No, me.

780
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,105
No other slayer, nohow.

781
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,613
If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.

782
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,250
Alice, you cannot live your life
to please others.

783
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:43,123
The choice must be yours,

784
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:47,057
because when you step out
to face that creature,

785
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,625
you will step out alone.

786
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:27,866
Nothing was ever accomplished
with tears.

787
01:20:29,841 --> 01:20:31,172
Absolem?

788
01:20:32,477 --> 01:20:34,342
Why are you upside down?

789
01:20:34,379 --> 01:20:36,904
I've come to the end of this life.

790
01:20:37,782 --> 01:20:41,377
- You're going to die?
- Transform.

791
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:44,980
Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.

792
01:20:45,857 --> 01:20:48,951
I can't help you if you don't even know
who you are, stupid girl.

793
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:50,585
I'm not stupid.

794
01:20:51,363 --> 01:20:53,888
My name is Alice. I live in London.

795
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,924
I have a mother named Helen
and a sister named Margaret.

796
01:20:56,968 --> 01:20:59,129
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.

797
01:20:59,204 --> 01:21:01,263
He had a vision that stretched
halfway around the world,

798
01:21:01,306 --> 01:21:03,331
and nothing ever stopped him.

799
01:21:03,408 --> 01:21:06,206
I'm his daughter. I'm Alice Kingsleigh.

800
01:21:06,711 --> 01:21:09,976
Alice, at last.

801
01:21:10,649 --> 01:21:12,674
You were just as dim-witted
the first time you were here.

802
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:15,515
You called it "Wonderland," as I recall.

803
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,823
Wonderland.

804
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,653
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

805
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:26,424
The Alice?

806
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:29,661
Then I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.

807
01:21:29,734 --> 01:21:31,759
<i>McTWISP: She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.</i>

808
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:34,271
Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please.

809
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,500
Have some tea.

810
01:21:35,574 --> 01:21:38,099
<i>You're not Absolem,
I'm Absolem, stupid girl.</i>

811
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,771
- What is this?
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.

812
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,304
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.

813
01:21:44,349 --> 01:21:46,647
<i>You'd think she would
remember all this from the first time.</i>

814
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:48,619
<i>Curiouser and curiouser.</i>

815
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,449
It wasn't a dream at all,
it was a memory.

816
01:21:53,358 --> 01:21:57,317
This place is real,
and so are you and so is the Hatter.

817
01:21:57,596 --> 01:22:00,030
And the Jabberwocky.

818
01:22:00,932 --> 01:22:04,333
Remember, the Vorpal sword
knows what it wants.

819
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:07,202
All you have to do is hold on to it.

820
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:15,237
Fairfarren, Alice.
Perhaps I will see you in another life.

821
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:19,761
- Hello, Iracebeth.
- Hello, Mirana.

822
01:24:23,074 --> 01:24:28,137
On this, the Frabjous Day,
the Queens Red and White

823
01:24:28,179 --> 01:24:32,878
shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf.

824
01:24:34,085 --> 01:24:37,350
Oh, Racie. We don't have to fight.

825
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,883
I know what you're doing.

826
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,323
You think you can blink
those pretty little eyes

827
01:24:45,363 --> 01:24:48,389
and I'll melt,
just like Mummy and Daddy did.

828
01:24:50,468 --> 01:24:51,696
Please.

829
01:24:53,204 --> 01:24:58,232
No! It is my crown! I am the eldest!

830
01:24:58,943 --> 01:25:00,433
Jabberwocky!

831
01:25:47,926 --> 01:25:49,723
This is impossible.

832
01:25:50,595 --> 01:25:52,620
Only if you believe it is.

833
01:25:58,503 --> 01:26:03,531
Sometimes I believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast.

834
01:26:04,509 --> 01:26:06,670
That is an excellent practice.

835
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,608
However, just at the moment,

836
01:26:13,184 --> 01:26:16,051
you really might want
to focus on the Jabberwocky.

837
01:26:22,293 --> 01:26:24,591
Where's your champion, Sister?

838
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,224
Here.

839
01:26:29,534 --> 01:26:30,899
Hello, Um.

840
01:26:44,983 --> 01:26:48,111
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.

841
01:26:52,724 --> 01:26:55,818
One, there's a potion
that can make you shrink.

842
01:26:59,397 --> 01:27:02,127
Two, and a cake
that can make you grow.

843
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:09,163
So, my old foe,
we meet on the battlefield once again.

844
01:27:10,408 --> 01:27:11,807
We've never met.

845
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:14,243
Not you, insignificant bearer.

846
01:27:15,113 --> 01:27:19,641
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.

847
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:22,852
That's enough chatter.

848
01:27:29,761 --> 01:27:32,355
Three, animals can talk.

849
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:39,569
Four, Alice,

850
01:27:41,973 --> 01:27:43,838
cats can disappear.

851
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,504
Five,

852
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:53,072
there's a place called Wonderland.

853
01:27:53,918 --> 01:27:55,078
Six,

854
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,821
I can slay the Jabberwocky.

855
01:28:23,348 --> 01:28:26,283
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!

856
01:30:53,064 --> 01:30:54,861
Off with your head!

857
01:31:27,498 --> 01:31:29,523
Kill her!

858
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:32,229
We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head.

859
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:34,930
How dare you? Off with his head!

860
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:22,284
Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes
against Underland are worthy of death.

861
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,849
However, that is against my vows,

862
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,594
therefore, you are banished
to the Outlands.

863
01:32:32,063 --> 01:32:36,022
No one is to show you any kindness,
or ever speak a word to you.

864
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:41,903
You will not have a friend in the world.

865
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:47,978
Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will.

866
01:32:51,616 --> 01:32:54,244
Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne,

867
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:56,309
you are to join Iracebeth in banishment

868
01:32:56,354 --> 01:32:59,152
from this day
until the end of Underland.

869
01:33:02,026 --> 01:33:04,221
At least we have each other.

870
01:33:17,308 --> 01:33:21,711
Majesty, please! Kill me! Please!

871
01:33:22,413 --> 01:33:24,711
But I do not owe you a kindness.

872
01:33:24,749 --> 01:33:27,718
- Take off my head!
- He tried to kill me.

873
01:33:27,752 --> 01:33:31,017
- Majesty! Please! Please!
- He tried to kill me.

874
01:33:31,055 --> 01:33:33,023
- I offer you my head!
- He tried to kill me!

875
01:33:33,057 --> 01:33:36,356
Oh, the Frabjous Day! Callou! Callay!

876
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:46,028
- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.

877
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:37,451
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.

878
01:34:37,822 --> 01:34:40,382
And for your efforts on our behalf...

879
01:34:44,628 --> 01:34:47,995
- Will this take me home?
- If that is what you choose.

880
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,050
You could stay.

881
01:35:19,397 --> 01:35:23,333
What an idea.
A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.

882
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:30,773
But I can't.

883
01:35:32,176 --> 01:35:36,237
There are questions I have to answer,
things I have to do.

884
01:35:44,855 --> 01:35:47,255
Be back again before you know it.

885
01:35:48,893 --> 01:35:50,758
You won't remember me.

886
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:54,259
Of course I will. How could I forget?

887
01:35:59,069 --> 01:36:03,028
Hatter, why is a raven
like a writing desk?

888
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:07,606
I haven't the slightest idea.

889
01:36:12,783 --> 01:36:14,546
Fairfarren, Alice.

890
01:37:01,665 --> 01:37:04,691
She left me standing there
without an answer.

891
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,929
A case of nerves, no doubt.

892
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,307
- Alice.
- Good Lord.

893
01:37:13,143 --> 01:37:15,441
- Are you all right?
- What happened to you?

894
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:18,539
I fell down a hole and hit my head.

895
01:37:18,816 --> 01:37:23,310
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.

896
01:37:24,822 --> 01:37:27,814
And there's that trouble
with your digestion.

897
01:37:28,826 --> 01:37:33,354
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.
I'll decide what to do with it.

898
01:37:36,734 --> 01:37:40,226
You're lucky to have my sister
for your wife, Lowell,

899
01:37:40,304 --> 01:37:44,035
and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

900
01:37:46,544 --> 01:37:49,035
There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.

901
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:52,310
You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.

902
01:37:54,685 --> 01:37:57,848
I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.

903
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,053
Don't worry, Mother,

904
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:05,095
I'll find something useful
to do with my life.

905
01:38:07,197 --> 01:38:10,689
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream.

906
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,905
- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.

907
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:19,402
You and I have business to discuss.

908
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:21,671
Shall we speak in the study?

909
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:30,580
Oh. And one more thing.

910
01:38:38,762 --> 01:38:43,631
My father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,

911
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:46,261
but I don't think
he was looking far enough.

912
01:38:46,303 --> 01:38:48,601
Why not go all the way to China?

913
01:38:49,406 --> 01:38:53,740
It's vast, the culture is rich,
and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.

914
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:58,106
To be the first to trade with China,
can you imagine it?

915
01:39:00,084 --> 01:39:01,745
You know, if anybody else
had said that to me,

916
01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:04,720
I'd say, "You've lost your senses".

917
01:39:04,922 --> 01:39:07,117
But I've seen that look before.

918
01:39:07,257 --> 01:39:11,751
Well, as you're not going to be
my daughter-in-law,

919
01:39:11,795 --> 01:39:15,754
perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.

920
01:39:55,639 --> 01:39:57,300
Hello, Absolem.

921
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,526
<i>Tripping out, spinning around</i>

922
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:21,553
<i>I'm underground
I fell down</i>

923
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:25,828
<i>Yeah, I fell down</i>

924
01:40:28,739 --> 01:40:32,732
<i>I'm freaking out
Where am I now?</i>

925
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:39,374
<i>Upside down and I can't stop it now</i>

926
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:44,412
<i>Can't stop me now</i>

927
01:40:49,159 --> 01:40:55,758
<i>I, I'll get by</i>

928
01:40:57,234 --> 01:41:03,969
<i>I, I'll survive</i>

929
01:41:05,542 --> 01:41:09,501
<i>When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground</i>

930
01:41:09,546 --> 01:41:13,277
<i>I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me</i>

931
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:20,051
<i>I, I won't cry</i>

932
01:41:23,193 --> 01:41:30,224
<i>I found myself in Wonderland</i>

933
01:41:31,468 --> 01:41:38,271
<i>Get back on my feet, the ground</i>

934
01:41:40,277 --> 01:41:44,077
<i>Is this real?</i>

935
01:41:44,114 --> 01:41:47,311
<i>Is it pretend?</i>

936
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:54,290
<i>I'll take a stand until the end</i>

937
01:41:57,728 --> 01:42:04,327
<i>I, I'll get by</i>

938
01:42:05,803 --> 01:42:12,538
<i>I, I'll survive</i>

939
01:42:14,044 --> 01:42:18,140
<i>When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground</i>

940
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:21,912
<i>I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me</i>

941
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:28,653
<i>I, I won't cry</i>

942
01:43:11,635 --> 01:43:16,470
<i>Oh, Alice, dear, where have you been?</i>

943
01:43:19,509 --> 01:43:24,276
<i>So near, so far, so in between</i>

944
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:32,044
<i>What have you heard?
What have you seen?</i>

945
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:36,890
<i>Alice, Alice, please, Alice</i>

946
01:43:43,834 --> 01:43:48,533
<i>Oh, tell us, are you big or small?</i>

947
01:43:51,608 --> 01:43:56,136
<i>To try this one or try them all</i>

948
01:43:59,516 --> 01:44:04,112
<i>It's such a long, long way to fall</i>

949
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:08,887
<i>Alice, Alice, oh, Alice</i>

950
01:44:16,099 --> 01:44:17,964
<i>How can you know this way, not that?</i>

951
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:19,992
<i>You choose the door
You choose the path</i>

952
01:44:20,037 --> 01:44:22,005
<i>Perhaps you should be coming back</i>

953
01:44:22,039 --> 01:44:23,836
<i>Another day, another day</i>

954
01:44:23,874 --> 01:44:25,967
<i>And nothing is quite what it seems</i>

955
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:27,806
<i>You're dreaming
Are you dreaming?</i>

956
01:44:27,844 --> 01:44:29,175
<i>Oh, Alice</i>

957
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:40,714
<i>Oh, Alice</i>

958
01:44:44,227 --> 01:44:47,924
<i>Oh!</i>

959
01:45:15,792 --> 01:45:20,786
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>

960
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:28,797
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>

961
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:40,138
<i>No time for tears today
No time for tears today</i>

962
01:45:44,187 --> 01:45:48,214
<i>No time for tears today
No time for tears today</i>

963
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,965
<i>So many doors, how did you choose?</i>

964
01:46:06,009 --> 01:46:07,909
<i>So much to gain, so much to lose</i>

965
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:09,775
<i>So many things got in your way</i>

966
01:46:09,813 --> 01:46:11,872
<i>No time today, no time today</i>

967
01:46:11,915 --> 01:46:13,883
<i>Be careful not to lose your head</i>

968
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:16,181
<i>Remember what the dormouse said</i>

969
01:46:16,219 --> 01:46:17,550
<i>Alice!</i>

970
01:46:27,764 --> 01:46:32,224
<i>Did someone pull you by the hand?</i>

971
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:40,201
<i>How many miles to Wonderland?</i>

972
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:48,217
<i>Please tell us so we'll understand</i>

973
01:46:48,251 --> 01:46:52,984
<i>Alice, Alice, oh, Alice</i>

974
01:47:03,767 --> 01:47:08,727
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>

975
01:47:11,775 --> 01:47:17,008
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>
