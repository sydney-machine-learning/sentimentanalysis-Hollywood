00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,001
* = Music or songs

3
00:00:56,433 --> 00:01:05,000
*"Leaning on the everlasting arms"
playing softly*

4
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,659
People did not give it credence that
a young girl could leave home.

5
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,565
And go off in the winter time
to avenge her father's blood.

6
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,057
But it did happen.

7
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:28,360
I was just fourteen years of age when a coward
by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down.

8
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:31,191
And robbed him of his life, and his horse.

9
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,320
And two California gold pieces that he carried
in his trouser band.

10
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,934
Chaney was a hired man.

11
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:42,789
And Papa had taken him up to fort Smith
to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd brought.

12
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,725
In town, Chaney had followed to drink.

13
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:49,652
And cards, and lost all his money.

14
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,743
He got it into his head he was being cheated.

15
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:55,621
And went back to the boarding house
for his Henry Rifle.

16
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,306
When Papa tried to intervene.

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,256
Chaney shot him.

18
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:03,307
Chaney fled.

19
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:09,324
He could have walked his horse.

20
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:12,526
For not a soul in that city could
be bothered to give chase.

21
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,459
No doubt Chaney fancied himself, scott free.

22
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,638
But he was wrong.

23
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:24,349
You must pay for everything in this world,
one way or another.

24
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,432
There is nothing free.

25
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,652
Except the grace of God.

26
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,280
Is that the man?

27
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,770
That is my father.

28
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,270
If you would like to kiss him,

29
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:26,954
It would be all right.

30
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,421
He's gone home.

31
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:30,485
Praise the Lord.

32
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,776
Why is it so much?

33
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:34,570
The quality of the casket.

34
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,206
And of the embalming.

35
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,466
The life like appearance requires time and art.

36
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:43,022
And the chemicals come dear,
the particulars are in your bill.

37
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,379
If you'd like to kiss him, It would be all right.

38
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,291
Thank you, the spirit has flown.

39
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,109
Your wire said fifty dollars.

40
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,845
You did not specify that
he was to be shipped.

41
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:58,225
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have.
It leaves nothing for our board.

42
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:02,189
Yarnell you can see to the body's transport
to the train station, and accompany it home.

43
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,577
I'll will have to sleep here tonight.

44
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,288
I still have to collect father's things
and see to some other business.

45
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,298
Your mama didn't say nothing about you
settling no business here.

46
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,541
It is business mama doesn't know about.
It's all right Yarnell, I dismiss you.

47
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,454
I am not sure.

48
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:17,743
Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home
and see that Papa is buried in his Mason's apron.

49
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,418
Your terms are agreeable, if I might
pass the night here.

50
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,860
Here, among these people?

51
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:29,139
-These people?
-I'm expecting three more souls.

52
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,852
Sullivan, Smith, and His-tongue-in-the-rain.

53
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,371
 Ladies and gentlemen, beware.

54
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,969
And train up your children
in the way that they should go.

55
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,522
You see what has become of me.

56
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,109
Because of drink.

57
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,644
I killed a man.

58
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,030
In a triffiling quarrel over a pocket knife.

59
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,778
If I had received good instruction as a child...

60
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,083
Can you point out the sheriff?

61
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,357
Him with the moustaches.

62
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:02,176
I would be with my wife and children today.
I do not know what is to become of them.

63
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:07,363
But I hope and pray that she will not slight them,

64
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:12,453
and compel them to go into low company.

65
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,345
Well.

66
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,267
I killed the wrong man, as the which-of-why I'm here.

67
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:30,003
Had I killed the man I meant to. I don't
believed I'd a been convicted.

68
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:33,220
I see men out there in that crowd,
that's worse than me.

69
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:37,598
Okay.

70
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:43,326
Indian: Before I am hanged,
I would like to say. Although...

71
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,296
Naw, we ain't arrested him.

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,820
Ain't caught up to him, he lit
out for the territory.

73
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,046
I would think that he's thrown in with
Lucky Ned Pepper, who's gang robbed a

74
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,407
mail hack yesterday on the Poteau river.

75
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,209
Well, why are you not looking for him?

76
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,436
I have no authority in the Indian Nation.

77
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,566
Tom Chaney is the business of the U.S Marshall’s now.

78
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,953
When will they arrest him?

79
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:19,030
Not soon, I'm afraid, the Marshall’s are not well staffed.

80
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:24,036
And  I'll tell you, frankly, Chaney's at the
end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors.

81
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,175
Could I hire a Marshall to pursue Tom Chaney?

82
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,384
You have a lot of experience with
bounty hunters, do you?

83
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:33,117
That is a silly question. I am here
to settle my father's affairs.

84
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:35,822
-All alone.
-Well I am the person for it.

85
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,821
Mama was never any good at sums.
And she could hardly spell 'cat'.

86
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,985
I intend to see Papa's killer hanged.

87
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:45,385
Well, nothing prevents you from offering a
reward and so informing the Marshall’s.

88
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,507
You’d have to pay real money though, to be persuasive.

89
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,887
Sheriff: Chaney's across the river, in Choctaw nation.

90
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,252
I will see to the money.
Who's the best Marshall?

91
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:54,428
I'd have to weigh that.

92
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:57,239
William Waters, is the best tracker.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,517
He's half Comanche, and it is something
to see him cut for signs.

94
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,522
The meanest, is Rooster Cogburn.

95
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,808
He is a pitiless man. Double tough.
Fear don't enter into his thinking.

96
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,673
Hmm, he loves to pull cork.

97
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,976
The best is probably, L.T. Quinn.

98
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,083
He brings his prisoners in alive.

99
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,775
Now he may let one slip by,

100
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:22,578
Now and again, but he believes that even the
worst of men, is entitled to a fair shake.

101
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:25,096
Where can I find this, Rooster?

102
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,526
The jakes is occupied.

103
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,638
I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.

104
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,201
I have prior business.

105
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,768
You've been at it for quite some time,
Mr. Cogburn.

106
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,941
There is no clock on my business.

107
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,637
The hell with you. How did you stalk me here?

108
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,565
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.

109
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,127
The saloon had referred me here, we must talk.

110
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,025
Women ain't allowed in the saloon.

111
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:54,370
I was not there as a customer.
I am fourteen years old.

112
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,490
The jakes is occupied.

113
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,869
Will be for some time.

114
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,265
Good evening.

115
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:25,839
If you would like to sleep in a coffin,
I would be honored.

116
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,880
How much are you paying for cotton?

117
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:52,962
Nine and a half, for low and middlin'
and ten for ordinary.

118
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,903
We got most of ours out early,

119
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:59,078
and sold to the Woodson brothers in
Little Rock for eleven cents.

120
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,836
Then I suggest you take the balance of it
to the Woodson brothers.

121
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,315
I did take the balance to Woodson.

122
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,141
We got ten and a half.

123
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,817
Why'd you come here to tell me this?

124
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:17,201
I thought we might shop around up here
next year but I guess we're doing all right in Little Rock.

125
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,614
I'm Mattie Ross.

126
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:22,866
Daughter of Frank Ross.

127
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:26,103
Aw, tragic thing.

128
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,671
May I say, your father impressed me.

129
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:34,224
With his manly qualities. He was a close trader,
but he acted a gentleman.

130
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,907
My proposal was to sell those ponies back to
you, that  my father brought.

131
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,805
Well that I fear, is out of the question.

132
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,772
I will see that they are shipped to
you, at my earliest convenience.

133
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,784
We don't want the ponies now,
we don't need them.

134
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,133
Well that hardly concerns me. Your
father brought the ponies, and paid for them.

135
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,828
And there's an end to it. I have the bill of sale.

136
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,400
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse that
was stolen from your stable.

137
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,775
You'll have to take that up with the
man who stole the horse.

138
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:01,738
Tom Chaney stole the horse
while it was in your care.

139
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,150
You were responsible.

140
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,093
Yeah, I admire your sand.

141
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:09,599
But I believe you will find I'm not
liable for such claims.

142
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,916
You were the custodian.

143
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,405
If you were a bank that were robbed. You could not
simply tell your depositors to go hang.

144
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,462
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is vexing enough.

145
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:22,533
Secondly your evaluation of the horse is high.

146
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,748
By about two hundred dollars.
How old are you?

147
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,842
If anything, my purse is low.

148
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,033
My Judy is a fine racing mare.

149
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:32,356
I've seen her jump an eight-rail fence
with a heavy rider. I am fourteen.

150
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,873
Oh, it's all very interesting.

151
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,051
The ponies are yours, take them.

152
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,931
Your father's horse was stolen
by a murderous criminal.

153
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,647
I have provided reasonable protection for the creature
as per our implicit agreement.

154
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:50,056
My watchman had his teeth knocked out,
and can take only soup.

155
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,524
I will take it to law.

156
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,015
You have no case.

157
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,924
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanell Arkansas

158
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,769
May think otherwise. As might a jury.

159
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,732
Petitioned by a widow and three small children.

160
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:06,231
I will pay two hundred dollars to your fathers estate.

161
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,728
When I have in my hand
a letter from your lawyer,

162
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:12,854
absolving me of all liability from the beginning
of the world to today.

163
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:13,934
I'll take two hundred dollars for Judy,

164
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:15,234
plus one hundred for the ponies.

165
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,726
And twenty five dollars for the grey horse
that Tom Chaney left.

166
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,455
He was easily worth, forty.

167
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,803
That is three hundred and twenty five dollars, sold.

168
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:25,043
The ponies have no part in it.
I will not buy them.

169
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,126
And the price for Judy is three hundred
and twenty five dollars.

170
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:31,145
I would not pay three hundred and twenty
five dollars for winged Pegasus.

171
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:34,545
As for the grey horse,
it does not belong to you.

172
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,505
The grey horse was lent to Tom Chaney
by my father.

173
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:38,294
Chaney only had the use of him.

174
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,495
I would pay two hundred and twenty five dollars.

175
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,383
And keep the grey horse.

176
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,870
I don't want the ponies.

177
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,007
I can't accept that.

178
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,050
There will be no settlement after I leave this
office. It will go to law.

179
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,586
All right, this is my last offer.

180
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,386
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

181
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:57,896
For that I get the release, previously discussed.

182
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,014
And I keep your father's saddle.

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,176
The grey horse is not yours to sell.

184
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,257
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.

185
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,558
My Lawyer Dagget will prove ownership of the grey horse.

186
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,838
-He will come after you with a rit of replevin.
-A what?

187
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,542
-Rit of replevin.
-All right, now look, look. Listen very carefully.

188
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,256
As I will not bargain further.

189
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:16,841
I will take the ponies back, and the
grey horse. Which is mine.

190
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:18,002
And settle...

191
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:22,971
For three hundred dollars. Now you must
take that or leave it.

192
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,193
And I do not much care which it is.

193
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:31,923
My Lawyer Daggert would not wish me to consider
anything under three hundred and twenty five dollars.

194
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,554
But I will settle for three hundred and twenty.

195
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:37,540
If I am given the twenty in advance.

196
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,569
Now here's what I have to say
about that saddle.

197
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,318
Mrs. Floyd: Frank Ross's daughter.

198
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,802
Oh, poor child.

199
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,570
Oh, oh child.

200
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:59,775
Now you going to stay with us, or
you hurrying back home to your momma?

201
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,594
Mattie: I'll stay here, if you can have me.

202
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:04,433
I just had my stay at the undertakers.

203
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,169
In the company of three corpses.

204
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,229
I felt like Ezekiel.

205
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:10,644
In valley of the dry bones.

206
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,257
Then, God bless you.

207
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:16,618
Now you will be rooming with,
Grandma Turner.

208
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,174
We've had to double up, with all the people
in town come to see the hanging.

209
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,169
Mrs. Floyd: This was in your poor father's room.

210
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,274
That is everything.

211
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,655
There are no light fingers in this house.

212
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,755
If you need something for to
tote the gun around?

213
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:46,846
I can give you an empty flour sack for a nickel.

214
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,991
Well what did you see when you arrived?

215
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:32,244
A woman, was out in the yard.

216
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,781
Dead with blow flies on her face.

217
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:40,793
An old man was inside with his breast blown
open by a scatter gun. His feet burned.

218
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,966
He was still alive, but just was. Said those
two Wharton boys had done it.

219
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,927
-Rode up, drunk.
-Objection.

220
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,205
Hearsay.

221
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,641
Dying declaration, your honor.

222
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,822
Objection's overruled.
Proceed Mr. Cogburn.

223
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:58,114
Now them two Wharton boys, Odus
and C.C. throwed down on him.

224
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:01,450
Asked him where his money was,
when he wouldn't tell them.

225
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,134
They lit pine knots, held them to his feet.

226
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,910
He told them the money was in the fruit jar.

227
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:11,252
Under a grey rock at the corner of the smoke house.

228
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:12,262
And then?

229
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:16,394
Well he died on us, passed
away in considerable pain.

230
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,582
What'd you do then?

231
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,533
Me and Marshall Potter
went out to the smoke house.

232
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,777
And that rock had been moved, the
jar with the money in it was gone.

233
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:27,612
- Objection, speculative.
-Sustained.

234
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:31,223
You found a flat grey rock,
in the corner of the smoke house.

235
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,539
With a hollowed out space there.

236
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,846
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence,
I suggest he be sworn.

237
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:41,105
Mr. Cogburn. What did you find, if anything,
in the corner of that smokehouse?

238
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:45,384
Found a flat grey rock with a hollowed
out space under it, nothing there.

239
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,479
-Well what did you...?
-No jar or nothing.

240
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,951
What did you do then?

241
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:53,641
Well, rode up to the Wharton's near where
the north fork strikes the Canadian....

242
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:54,857
What did you find?

243
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:55,890
...branch of the Canadian.

244
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,458
I had my glass, spotted them two boys
and their old daddy Aaron.

245
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,688
Down in the creek bank with some hogs.

246
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,746
They killed a shoat.

247
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:08,819
Had a fire built up under a wash pot
for scalding water.

248
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,760
What'dja do?

249
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,083
Announced we was U.S. Marshall’s, I hollered
out to Aaron.

250
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,507
I needed to talk to his two boys.

251
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,033
He raised an axe.

252
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,854
Commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.

253
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,046
Barlow: What did you do then?

254
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,222
I backed away from the axe.

255
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,960
Tried to talked some sense into him.

256
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:33,914
While this was going on C.C. he edges over
to the wash pot there, behind the steam.

257
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,921
Picks up a shot gun.

258
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:39,162
Potter seen him, but it was to late.

259
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:43,104
C.C. Wharton pulled out on
Potter with one barrel.

260
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,439
Turned to do the same for me and I shot him.

261
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,981
And the old man raised the axe.

262
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,171
And I shot him.

263
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,431
Odus lit out, and I shot him.

264
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:03,097
C.C. Wharton and Aaron Wharton was dead when
they hit the ground, but Odus was just winged.

265
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,772
Barlow: Did you find the jar with a
hundred and twenty dollars in it?

266
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,865
-Leading.
-Sustained.

267
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,848
What happened then?

268
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,609
Found a jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.

269
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:14,719
What became of Odus Wharton?

270
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,200
There he sits.

271
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,201
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.

272
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,915
Thank you Mr. Barlow.

273
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,271
Mr. Cogburn.

274
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,719
In your four years as a U.S. Marshall.

275
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,593
How many men have you shot?

276
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:45,652
Never shot nobody that didn't ask for it.

277
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,579
Well that was not the question.

278
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,512
How many?

279
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,100
Shot or killed?

280
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:56,366
Let us restrict it to "killed", so that
we may have a manageable figure.

281
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,847
About twelve.

282
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,410
Fifteen stopping men in flight,
defending myself, et cetera.

283
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,173
Around twelve he says.

284
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,882
Or fifteen.

285
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:09,602
So many, you cannot keep
a precise count.

286
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:13,378
Goudy: I have examined the records, and can
supply the accurate figure.

287
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,550
Uhh...

288
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:19,365
I believe them two Wharton boys
makes it twenty three.

289
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,478
And how many members of this one family,

290
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,933
the Wharton family, have you killed?

291
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:29,694
-Immediate or..
-Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother?

292
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:31,598
And Clete Wharton, half brother.

293
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,715
Well Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee.
He come at me with a king bolt

294
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,169
A King bolt?

295
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,022
You are armed, and he advanced upon you.

296
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,864
With nothing more than a king bolt?

297
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,425
From a wagon tongue?

298
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,411
I've seen men badly torn up with nothing
bigger than a king bolt. I defended myself.

299
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,165
Returning to the other encounter.

300
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,674
With Aaron Wharton, and his two remaining sons.

301
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,154
You sprang from cover.

302
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,678
With revolver in hand.

303
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,578
-That'd be it.
-Loaded and cocked.

304
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,297
Well if it ain't loaded
and cocked, it don't shoot.

305
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:10,737
And like his son, Aaron Wharton
advanced against an armed man.

306
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:12,866
Well he was armed, he had an axe raised.

307
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,844
I believe you testified you backed away
from Aaron Wharton.

308
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,067
-That's right.
-Which direction were you going?

309
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:24,192
I always go backwards, when I'm backing up.

310
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Very amusing.

311
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:29,967
Goudy: Now he advanced on you much
in the manner of Clete Wharton.

312
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:35,049
Menacing you with that little ol' King bolt,
or rolled up newspaper, or whatever it was.

313
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,799
Yes sir, he commit to cussin' and

314
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,521
-Laying about a threat.
-And you were backing away.

315
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,520
How many steps before the shooting started?

316
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,173
Uh, seven to eight steps.

317
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:51,180
Goudy: Good, Aaron Wharton keeping pace.

318
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,578
Advancing away from his campfire.

319
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,724
Seven, eight, steps.

320
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,868
What would that be? Fifteen, twenty feet?

321
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,105
I suppose.

322
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:05,309
Will you explain to this jury, Mr. Cogburn.

323
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,449
Why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by his
wash pot, one arm in the fire.

324
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,595
Goudy: His sleeve and hand smoldering.

325
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,164
Did you move the body after you shot him?

326
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,479
Why would I do that?

327
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,581
You did not drag the body over to
the fire and fling his arm in.

328
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,576
-No, sir.
-Two witnesses.

329
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:23,572
Who arrived on the scene will testify
to the location of the body.

330
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:26,243
Goudy: You do not remember moving the body.

331
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:32,848
So it was, a cold blooded bushwhack,
while poor Mr. Wharton was tending to his campfire.

332
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:33,962
Objection.

333
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:37,250
If that's where the body was,
I might have moved him.

334
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:38,949
I do not remember.

335
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,900
Why, would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?

336
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:45,923
Them hogs, moving around,
they might have moved him.

337
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,792
I'd do not remember.

338
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,571
Rooster mumbling: Pencil neck, son of a bitch.

339
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:56,231
-Mr. Cogburn.
-Rooster: What is it?

340
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,363
I'd like to talk to you a minute.

341
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,708
Rooster: What is it?

342
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:03,064
They tell me you're a man with, True Grit.

343
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,121
What do you want, girl?

344
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,722
Speak up, it's suppertime.

345
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:09,996
Let me do that.

346
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:12,323
Your makings are too dry.

347
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:16,360
I'm looking for the man who shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross in front of the Monarch boarding house.

348
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,612
The man's name is Tom Chaney.

349
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,700
They say he's over in Indian territory,
and I need somebody to go after him.

350
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,616
What's your name, girl.

351
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,158
My name is Mattie Ross.

352
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:28,259
We're located in Yell county.

353
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,473
My mother is at home looking after my
sister Victoria and my brother little Frank.

354
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,624
You best go home to them.

355
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,621
They will need help with the churning.

356
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,078
There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney.

357
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,502
Government will pay you two dollars for
bringing him in plus ten cents a mile for each of you.

358
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,397
On top of that, I will pay you
a fifty dollar reward.

359
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:46,679
What are you?

360
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,686
What you got there in your poke?

361
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:54,536
My god, a Colt Dragoon.

362
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:58,597
You're no bigger than a corn muffin.
What are you doing with a pistol like that?

363
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:00,557
Well I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.

364
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,927
-Kill Tom Chaney?
-If the law fails to do so.

365
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:04,860
Well that piece will do the job for you.

366
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:08,327
If you can find a high stump to rest it on,
and a wall to put behind you.

367
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,605
Nobody here knew my father and I'm,

368
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:12,374
afraid nothing's going to be done about
Chaney except I do it.

369
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:16,005
My brother is a child, and my mother is
indecisive and hobbled by grief.

370
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,789
I don't believe you have fifty dollars.

371
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,259
I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill,

372
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,469
which he will make payment on
tomorrow, or the next day.

373
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,989
Once our lawyer countersigns.

374
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:33,285
Don't believe in fairy tales or sermons or stories about
money, baby sister. But thanks for the cigarette.

375
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:19,143
Isn't your Mama expecting you home, dear?

376
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,227
My business is not yet finished.

377
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,616
Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up?

378
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:28,654
Grandma Turners, the bed is quite narrow.

379
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,570
Mrs. Floyd: The second floor in the back did open up.

380
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,865
But uh, that gentleman on the porch,

381
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,270
has just taken it.

382
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:38,052
Mrs. Floyd: Oh but don't worry yourself, dear.

383
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:40,662
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.

384
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,850
My name is La Boeuf.

385
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,259
I just come from Yell county.

386
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,266
We have no rodeo clowns in Yell county.

387
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:40,745
A saucy line will not get you far with me.

388
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,982
I saw your mother yesterday morning.

389
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,886
She said for you to come right on home.

390
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,794
What was your business there?

391
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,418
This is a man I think you know.

392
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,768
You called him, Tom Chaney.

393
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,305
I believe. Though in the months I've been tracking
him he has used the name, Theron Chelmsford.

394
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:10,696
John Todd Anderson,

395
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,021
and others.

396
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:15,361
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and
Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

397
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,345
Before turning up at your fathers place.

398
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:20,993
Then why did you not catch him at,
Pine Bluff, Arkansas or Monroe, Louisiana?

399
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,921
He is a crafty one.

400
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:26,177
I thought him slow witted myself.

401
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,824
That was his act.

402
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,344
It was a good one.

403
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:31,956
Are you some kind of law?

404
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,072
That's right

405
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,279
I'm a Texas Ranger.

406
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,299
That may make you a big noise
in that state.

407
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,878
In Arkansas you should know that
your Texas Rangers trappings and title

408
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:47,218
do not make you an object of fun.

409
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,703
Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?

410
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:55,934
He shot and killed a state senator
named Bibbs in Waco Texas.

411
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,879
Bibb's family put out a reward.

412
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,098
How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?

413
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,403
My understanding is there was an argument about a dog.

414
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:04,497
You know anything about the
whereabouts of Chaney?

415
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,056
He is in the territory, and I hold out
little hope for you winning your bounty.

416
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:10,262
-Why is that?
-I'm going to beat you to it.

417
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:13,061
I've hired a deputy Marshall.
The toughest one they have.

418
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:17,030
And he's familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang
they say Chaney's tied up with.

419
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:20,138
Well, I will throw in with you
and your Marshall.

420
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,563
No, Marshall Cogburn and I are fine.

421
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:24,154
It'll be to our mutual advantage.

422
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:27,095
Your Marshall, I presume, knows the territory.

423
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:30,607
I know Chaney. It is at least a two man
job to take him alive.

424
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:34,029
When Chaney is taken he's coming back to
Fort Smith to hang.

425
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,206
I'm not having him go to Texas to
hang for shooting some Senator.

426
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:39,772
It is not important where he hangs, is it?

427
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:40,773
It is to me.

428
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:42,093
Is it to you?

429
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,511
It means a great deal of money to me,

430
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:46,105
it's been many month's work.

431
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,901
Well I'm sorry that you are paid
piece work and not on wages.

432
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:52,366
And that you have been eluded the winter long by a half-wit.

433
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,644
You give out very little sugar
with your pronouncements.

434
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,256
When I sat there watching  you, I gave some
thought to stealing a kiss.

435
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:03,671
But you are very young and sick, and

436
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,149
unattractive to boot,

437
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,075
but now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

438
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,291
That wouldn't be as unpleasant as the other.

439
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,166
If you wet your comb, you might tame that cowlick.

440
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:20,820
Madame, I wish you would leave these matters

441
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,625
entirely to me or at the very least

442
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:26,003
give me the courtesy of consulting me before
entering such agreements.

443
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:30,200
I am not scolding you, but I am saying your
head strong ways,

444
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,549
will lead you into a tight corner one day.

445
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:34,828
I trust the enclosed document

446
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:37,880
will let you conclude your business and
return to Yell County.

447
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:41,080
Yours, J. Noble Daggett.

448
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,517
I was as bad yesterday as
you look today.

449
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:46,165
Of course you don't share
a bed with Grandma Turner.

450
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,725
I'm not acquainted with Grandma Turner.

451
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:54,591
She's a resident of this city, it does not
surprise me that she carry's disease.

452
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:59,685
This malarial place has ruined my health.

453
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,533
As it has my finances.

454
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,788
I owe you money.

455
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,167
You have not traded poorly.

456
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:06,812
Oh, certainly not.

457
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,564
I'm paying you for a horse.

458
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,926
I do not possess.

459
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,282
And I brought back a string of useless ponies.

460
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:16,312
Which I cannot sell again.

461
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:18,541
You're forgetting the Grey horse.

462
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,203
-Right.
-You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.

463
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:24,710
I am looking at it in the light
of Gods eternal truth.

464
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,925
Your illness is putting you down
in the dumps.

465
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,832
You will soon find another buyer for the ponies.

466
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,100
Well I have a tentative offer
for ten dollars per head.

467
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:36,436
From the "Pfitzer Soap Works" of Little Rock

468
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:39,079
It would be a shame to destroy
such spirited horse flesh.

469
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:42,941
So it would. I'm confident the deal
will fall through.

470
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:48,566
Look here, I need a pony and I will
pay ten dollars for one of them.

471
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,024
No that's a lot price, no, no, I.

472
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,072
Wait a minute.

473
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,622
Are we trading again?

474
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,419
This one is beautiful.

475
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,581
 He don't know he got a rider.

476
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,838
You're to light.

477
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:26,448
He thinks he has a horsefly on him.

478
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,015
He's very spirited.

479
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,815
I'll call him 'Little Blackie'.

480
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:31,402
That's a good name.

481
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,273
What does he like for a treat?

482
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:38,452
Well ma'am, he's a horse.

483
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,152
So he likes apples.

484
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,601
Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

485
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:47,294
No ma'am,
I ain't suppose to utter your name.

486
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,520
See, sleep.

487
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:54,765
That is fine, I will wake him.

488
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,520
Marshall Cogburn.

489
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,385
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.

490
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,524
How long 'till you are ready to go?

491
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,818
- Go where?
-To the Indian Territory to pursue Tom Chaney.

492
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,221
Oh, you're the grieved girl with
the stories of El Dorado.

493
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,144
Huh, how much money you got there?

494
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:19,330
I did say fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney,
you did not believe me?

495
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,870
I did not know.

496
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,258
You are one to figure.

497
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,049
How long for you to make
ready to depart?

498
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,690
Well uh, hold on sis.

499
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:33,311
I remember your offer, I
do not remember agreeing to it.

500
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,775
If I'm to go up against, Ned Pepper.

501
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:41,245
Then I'll need a hundred dollars.
That much I can tell you. A hundred dollars.

502
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,369
To retrieve your man, a hundred dollars.

503
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,306
Will take a fifty dollar advance.
It'll be for expenses.

504
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:55,097
You are trying to take advantage of me.

505
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,128
I'm giving you the children's rate.

506
00:30:57,129 --> 00:31:02,694
I'm not a sharper. An old man sleeping in a rope
bed. In a room behind the Chinese grocery.

507
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,992
- I have nothing.
-You want to be kept in whiskey.

508
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,228
I don't have to buy that.

509
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:09,543
I'd confiscate it.

510
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:11,493
Enough for a quart.

511
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,755
Ah, thank you.

512
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,231
Hundred dollars, that’s the rate.

513
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,028
Then I shall not niggle.

514
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:18,894
Can we depart this afternoon?

515
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:20,836
We?

516
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:24,177
You are not going, that ain't no part of it.

517
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:29,129
You have misjudged me if you think I'm silly enough
to give you fifty dollars and watch you simply ride off.

518
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:31,237
I'm a bonded U.S. Marshall.

519
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,429
That weighs but little with me.

520
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,639
I will see the thing done.

521
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,075
Damn ducks, can't go after Ned Pepper,

522
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:40,252
and a band of hard men and look after
a baby at the same time.

523
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,413
I am not a baby.

524
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:45,747
Won't be stopping at boarding houses,
where there's warm bed and hot grub on the table.

525
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,092
I'd be grabbing the saddle, eating light.

526
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:50,598
Where the sleeping would only
take place on the ground.

527
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,368
Well I have slept out a night before.

528
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,544
Papa took me on a fine coon hunt
last summer on the Petit Jean.

529
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,134
We were in the woods all night.

530
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:01,611
We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories.

531
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:03,089
We had a good time.

532
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,816
Coon hunt?

533
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,307
This ain't no coon hunt.

534
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,194
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.

535
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,641
Don't come within forty miles of being a coon hunt.

536
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:13,406
You are just trying to make your work
sound harder than it is.

537
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,831
Here's the money.

538
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:16,387
Now I aim to get Tom Chaney,

539
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:18,888
and if you are not gamed, I will find
somebody who is gamed.

540
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:21,340
All I've heard out of you so far is talk.

541
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:24,433
I know you can drink whiskey, and snore and spit
and wallow in filth and bemoan your station.

542
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,028
The rest has been braggadocio.

543
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,763
They told me you had grit, and
that is why I came to you.

544
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:32,532
I'm not paying for talk. I can get all the talk
I need and more at the Monarch boarding house.

545
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:38,949
Leave your money.

546
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,304
Meet me here at seven o'clock tomorrow morning
and we can begin our 'coon hunt'.

547
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,369
Mattie: Dearest mother,

548
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,179
I'm about to embark on a great adventure.

549
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,967
I have learned that Tom Chaney has
fled into the wild.

550
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,803
And I shall assist the authorities in pursuit.

551
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,430
You know that Papa would want me
to be firm in the right.

552
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,820
As he always was.

553
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,150
So do not fail on my account.

554
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,000
Though I walk through the valley, of the shadow of death.

555
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,604
I shall fear no evil.

556
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,724
The author of all things watches over me, and

557
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,223
I have a fine horse.

558
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:23,278
Kiss little Frankie for me,
and pinch Violet's cheek.

559
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:26,037
My Papa's death will soon be avenged.

560
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,964
I'm off for the Choctaw nation,

561
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:39,689
Where's Marshall Cogburn?

562
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,802
Went away.

563
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,579
Left this.

564
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,981
Here inside is a train ticket for your return home.

565
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:50,934
Use it.

566
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:54,786
By the time you read this, I will be across
the river in the Indian Nation.

567
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:56,688
Pursuit will be futile.

568
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,272
I will return with your man, Chaney.

569
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:01,136
Leave me to my work.

570
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:02,774
Rueben Cogburn.

571
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:12,393
Is that Rooster Cogburn?

572
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:13,774
That is the man.

573
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:14,788
Mattie: Who's he with?

574
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,661
I do not know.

575
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:17,881
Well take me across.

576
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,541
So, you're the runaway.

577
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:23,717
Marshall told me you'd show up.
I'm to present you to the Sheriff.

578
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,868
That is a story, let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.

579
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,131
If you don't turn around and take me across,

580
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:34,283
you may find yourself in court
where you don't want to be.

581
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:35,284
I have a good lawyer.

582
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:44,718
HEY!

583
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:47,817
Go, Little Blackie.

584
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:48,823
Come on.

585
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,091
That is quite a horse.

586
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:05,828
Rooster: I would give you ten dollars for him.

587
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:07,301
From the money you stole from me?

588
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:09,767
That was not stolen, I'm after your man.

589
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,281
I was to accompany you.

590
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:14,062
If I do not there is no agreement and
my money was stolen.

591
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,349
Let's put this child back on the ferry

592
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,721
It's a long road and time's a wasting.

593
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,733
If I go back it's to the U.S. Marshals office
to report the theft of my money.

594
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:24,583
And futile Marshall Cogburn?
"Pursuit would be futile"?

595
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:27,017
It's not spelled, F-U-D-E-L.

596
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,510
It's time for your spanking.

597
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:44,031
Now you would DO as the grown-ups say.

598
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,189
Or I will get myself a burr switch
and strap your leg.

599
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,590
Mattie cries: Are you going to let him do this, Marshall.

600
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,836
No, I don't believe I will.
Put your switch away, La Boeuf.

601
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:03,849
I aim to finish what I started.

602
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,066
That'll be the biggest mistake you ever made.

603
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,848
Let's check this brass popper.

604
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:23,671
Hoorawed by a little girl.

605
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,991
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.

606
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:45,459
In Texas we make due with a fire
little more than twigs.

607
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:48,352
Buffalo chips.

608
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,522
Heat the nights rations of beans.

609
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:52,903
And it is Ranger,

610
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,066
policy never to make the camp in
the same place as your cook fire.

611
00:37:56,831 --> 00:38:00,014
Very imprudent to make your presence
known in unsettled country.

612
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:09,780
How do you know Bagby will have intelligence?

613
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:11,840
He has a store.

614
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,257
That makes him an authority on movements
in the Territory?

615
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,504
We have entered a wild place.

616
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,663
And anyone coming in,

617
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,734
wanting any kind of supply.

618
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:23,256
cannot pick and choose his portal.

619
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,926
That is a piece of foolishness.

620
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,276
All the snakes are asleep this time of year.

621
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:30,899
They've been known to wake up.

622
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,087
Well let me have a rope, too.

623
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:34,014
Likely not bother you.

624
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,451
You are to little and boney.

625
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:40,230
You should fetch the water,
for the morning, put it by the fire.

626
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,593
-The creek will ice over, tonight.
-I'm not going down there again.

627
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,092
If you want anymore water,
you can go fetch it yourself.

628
00:38:45,093 --> 00:38:48,151
You're lucky to be traveling in a place
where a spring is so handy.

629
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:52,321
In my country you could ride for days and
see no ground water.

630
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,395
I have lapped filthily water from a hoof print.

631
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,067
And was glad to have it.

632
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,485
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies.

633
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,224
Who says he had never drank
water out of a horse track.

634
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:06,098
I think I'd shake his hand and
give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

635
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:07,134
You do not believe it?

636
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:10,588
Oh, I believe it, the first twenty
five times I heard it.

637
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:13,676
Maybe, maybe just true.

638
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,646
Maybe lapping water off the ground is
Ranger policy.

639
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,052
You're getting ready to show your ignorance
now, Cogburn.

640
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,650
I don't mind a little personal chaffing.

641
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:26,497
But I won't hear anything against the
Ranger troop from a man like you.

642
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,959
How long you boys been mounted
on sheep down there?

643
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,888
My white Appaloosa will still be galloping,

644
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,606
when that big American stud of yours
is winded and collapsed.

645
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,382
Now make another joke about it.

646
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:42,035
You are only trying to put on
a show for this girl, Mattie.

647
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,368
With what you must think is a keen tongue.

648
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,736
This is like women talking.

649
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:47,898
Yes, that is the way.

650
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,445
Make me out foolish in this girls eyes.

651
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:53,387
I think she has you pretty well figured.

652
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,571
Would you two like to hear the
story of the 'Midnight caller'?

653
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:07,175
One of you is gonna have to be the caller.

654
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,666
And I will tell you what to say.

655
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,110
And I will do all the other parts myself.

656
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:37,409
Good morning, Marshall.
-Morning.

657
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,246
Where's Mr. La Boeuf?

658
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:42,145
Down by the creek performing his necessaries.

659
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:46,136
Marshall Cogburn, I welcome
the chance for a private parley.

660
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:49,877
I gather that you and Mr. La Boeuf have come to some,

661
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,085
some sort of agreement.

662
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:53,982
And as your employer I believe
I have a right to know the particulars.

663
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,185
The particulars?

664
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:58,323
Is that we bring Chaney down
to the magistrate,

665
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:03,146
in San Saba, Texas wherein there's a
considerable reward on him for which we split.

666
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:06,253
I did not want him brought to Texas,

667
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:09,117
to have a Texas punishment administered
for a Texas crime.

668
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,031
That was not our agreement.

669
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:14,091
What you want is to have him caught
and punished.

670
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:16,919
I want him to know he's being punished
for killing my father.

671
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,128
Well, you can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.

672
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,925
You can spit on him.

673
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,766
Make him eat sand out on the road.
I will hold him down.

674
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:26,620
If you what.

675
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,301
I'll flay the flesh off the souls of his feet.

676
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:31,888
Find you Indian pepper you
can rub in his wound.

677
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,831
Isn't that a hundred dollar value?

678
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:35,173
No, it is not.

679
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,586
When I have brought and paid for
something, I will have my way.

680
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,105
Why do you think I'm paying you,
if not to have my way.

681
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,589
It's time for you to learn.

682
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,152
You cannot have your way.

683
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:45,811
In every little particular.

684
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:48,681
If you find I failed to satisfied your terms.

685
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:51,847
I'll return your money at the end
of this expedition.

686
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:55,085
Little Blackie and I are ridding back
to the U.S. Marshall's office, this is fraud.

687
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:56,093
God damn it.

688
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,434
What's going on?

689
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,495
This is a business conversation.

690
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:00,575
Is that what you call it?

691
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:03,341
Sounds to me you're still being
hoorawed by a little girl.

692
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:05,368
-You say, hooraw?
-That was the point.

693
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,760
There is no hoorawing.
My agreement with the Marshall,

694
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,477
ante-dates your's. It has the force of law.

695
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:10,669
The force of law?

696
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,561
This man is a notorious thumper.

697
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:16,124
He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill.

698
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,637
-And Bloody Bill Anderson.
-Them men were patriots, Texas trash.

699
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,502
They murdered women and children
in Lawrence, Kansas.

700
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:23,190
That's a God damn lie!

701
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,798
What army was you in, Mister?

702
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:26,904
I was at Shreveport.

703
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:28,665
First with Kirby Smith, then with...

704
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,430
What side was you on?

705
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,610
I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn.

706
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:34,549
And I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.

707
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,812
If  you had served with Captain Quantrill.

708
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,454
Captain!
Captain Quantrill.

709
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:41,189
That...indeed.

710
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,311
-You'd had best let this go, La Boeuf.
-Captain of what?

711
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:48,890
Good then.

712
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,228
There's not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas,

713
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:53,820
to make it worth my while to
listen to your business.

714
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,292
Our agreement is nullified.

715
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:56,305
That suits me.

716
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:58,426
It's each man for himself.

717
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:00,072
Congratulations, Cogburn.

718
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:03,492
You've graduated from a marauder,
to wet nurse.

719
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:07,544
La Boeuf: A-dios.

720
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,981
We don't need him, do we Marshall?

721
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:20,498
Gonna miss his Sharps Carbine.

722
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,393
It's apt to get lively out here.

723
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:47,283
HEY!

724
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:51,072
Go on.

725
00:43:58,567 --> 00:43:59,974
You stay here, sister.

726
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,768
And I'm going to see Bagby.

727
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,489
Has Chaney been here?

728
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,686
No.

729
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:28,860
Coke Hayes was, two days ago.

730
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,888
Coke rides with Lucky Ned.

731
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:32,511
He brought supplies with this.

732
00:44:36,062 --> 00:44:37,586
Well this is Papa's gold piece.

733
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:39,669
Tom Chaney here we come.

734
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,233
Not the worlds only California gold piece.

735
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:44,010
They are rare here.

736
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:45,201
They are rare.

737
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,543
But if it is, Chaney's.

738
00:44:47,544 --> 00:44:49,971
It could just as easily mean that Lucky Ned

739
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:52,438
and his gang fell upon him as he fell in with them.

740
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,666
Chaney could be a corpse.

741
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,768
That would be a bitter disappointment
Marshall, what do we do?

742
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,294
Um, pursue them.

743
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:04,272
Ned's unfinished business for the Marshall's anyhow.
When we have him, we'll also have Chaney.

744
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:06,332
Or we can know the whereabouts
of his body.

745
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,792
Bagby didn't know which way they went.

746
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,585
But now that we know they come through here.

747
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,419
They couldn't have gone but one of two ways.

748
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,735
Heading north, towards the Winding Stair Mountains.

749
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:17,564
Or pushing further west.

750
00:45:18,746 --> 00:45:20,549
I expect north, there is more to rob.

751
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,439
I found an eating place,

752
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,684
called the 'Green frog'.

753
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,344
Started calling myself, Burroughs.

754
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,695
But my drinking picked up.

755
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:32,443
My wife did not care for the company
of my river friends.

756
00:45:32,444 --> 00:45:35,296
She decided to go back to her first husband.

757
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,350
A clerk in a hardware store.

758
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,829
That was when she said,
"Goodbye Ruben".

759
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:44,423
'A love of decency,
did not abide in you."

760
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:48,336
A divorced woman
talking about decency.

761
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,882
I told her, goodbye Nola.

762
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:54,282
Hope that little nail selling bastard
will keep you happy this time.

763
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:56,890
She took my boy with her too.

764
00:45:57,898 --> 00:46:00,378
He never cared for me anyway.

765
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:04,199
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.

766
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,097
I did not mean anything by it.

767
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:10,778
I've never seen a clumsier child than, Horace.

768
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,009
I bet he broke forty cups.

769
00:46:43,707 --> 00:46:45,038
Is it, Chaney?

770
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:48,223
I would not recognize the
souls of his feet.

771
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:51,885
Well, you'll have
to clamber up and look.

772
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:54,345
I'm to old and to fat.

773
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:57,913
Now the Green Frog had one billiard table.

774
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,584
Served ladies and men both, but...

775
00:47:00,814 --> 00:47:04,388
mostly men, had been
running it for myself for a while,

776
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,351
but couldn't keep good help.

777
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:09,066
Never did learn how to buy meat.

778
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:11,417
That him?

779
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:13,421
I believe not.

780
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:15,128
Well, cut him down.

781
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,517
Why?

782
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:18,199
I might know him.

783
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:24,656
Last time I went out to the
staked plains of Texas.

784
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:29,719
Shoot buffaloes with Vernon Shaftoe and
a flathead Indian name Olly.

785
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:34,247
The Mormons had run Saftoe
out of great Salt Lake city.

786
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,709
But don't ask me what for.

787
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,179
Thought it was a misunderstanding
and leave it go at that.

788
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:43,898
Ah, the Big Shaggies.

789
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,548
They're all gone now.

790
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:46,567
Damn shame.

791
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:51,491
Give three dollars right now for
a pickled buffalo tongue.

792
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,382
Why did they hang him so high?

793
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,288
Rooster: I do not know.

794
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:01,624
Must play in the belief
it'll make him more dead.

795
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:17,248
I do not know this man.

796
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:49,826
(Rooster speaks to rider)

797
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,862
Why is he taking the hanged man?

798
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:00,373
Did he know him?

799
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,880
He did not.

800
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,500
But it is a dead body.

801
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:07,111
Must be worth something in the trade.

802
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,935
Now my second wife, Edna.

803
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:12,434
She got the notion. She wanted
me to be a lawyer.

804
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:16,237
Bought this heavy book called, "Daniel
unnegotionable instruments".

805
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:17,931
Set me to reading it.

806
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:21,163
Never could get a grip on it.

807
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:24,379
I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.

808
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:30,312
There ain't six trees between here and Canada,
Nothing else grows that has stickers on it.

809
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,245
As for...

810
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,809
-I knew it.
-Mattie: Knew what?

811
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:38,492
We're being followed.

812
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:43,085
I asked that injun to signal me a shot
if someone was on our trail.

813
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,677
Should we be concerned, Marshall?

814
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:50,778
Naw, Mr. La Boeuf is using us
as bird dogs.

815
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,334
In hopes of cutting in once we've flushed the prey.

816
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:59,325
Perhaps we could double back over our
tracks and confuse the trail in a clever way.

817
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:02,142
No, we will wait right here.

818
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:05,683
Offer our friend a warm hello.

819
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:07,601
Ask him where he's going.

820
00:51:03,502 --> 00:51:05,000
You are not La Boeuf.

821
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:09,038
My name is, Forster.

822
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,161
I practice,

823
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,680
Dentistry in the nation.

824
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,558
Also veterinary arts.

825
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:17,725
And medicine.

826
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:21,399
On those humans that will sit still for it.

827
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:24,753
You have your work cut out for you there.

828
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:32,001
Traded for him with an Indian who said he
came by him honestly.

829
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:37,727
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.

830
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,369
Do either of you need

831
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,069
Medical attention?

832
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,478
No.
Say, it is fixing to get cold.

833
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,688
You  know of anywhere to take shelter?

834
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:53,461
I have my bear skin.

835
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:02,570
You might want to head over
to the Original Greaser Bob's.

836
00:52:03,295 --> 00:52:08,475
He launched a dugout into a hollow
along the Carrillon river.

837
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:12,027
If you ride the river.

838
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,107
You won't fail to see it.

839
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,955
Greaser Bob, the original.

840
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:18,571
Greaser Bob,

841
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:21,345
is hunting north of the picket wire.

842
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,361
and would not begrudge its use.

843
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:29,637
-Much obliged.
-Now, I have taken his teeth.

844
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,655
I will entertain an offer,

845
00:52:33,656 --> 00:52:35,354
for the rest of him.

846
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:45,439
Take my jacket.

847
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,535
Creep up on the roof.

848
00:52:50,197 --> 00:52:53,350
If they're unfriendly I'll give you a sign
to damp the chimney.

849
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:19,742
Who's out there?

850
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:21,870
We're looking for shelter.

851
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:25,763
No room for you here, ride on.

852
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:30,396
-Who’s in there?
-2nd Man: Ride on.

853
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:12,250
I'm a federal officer.

854
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:13,338
Who's in there?

855
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,295
A Methodist and a son of a bitch.

856
00:54:16,474 --> 00:54:18,158
This is Rooster Cogburn.

857
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,243
Columbus Potter and five other Marshall’s
is out here with me.

858
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,913
We got a bucket of coal oil.

859
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:27,632
In one minute we will burn your
house from both ends.

860
00:54:27,633 --> 00:54:29,273
There's only two of you.

861
00:54:29,419 --> 00:54:31,605
Go ahead and bet your life on it.

862
00:54:31,803 --> 00:54:33,562
How many of you is in there?

863
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:34,654
Just the two of us.

864
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:36,249
But my partner's hit.

865
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,803
And he can't walk.

866
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,699
Is that Emmet Quincy?

867
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,980
You said it was a man on the roof.

868
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:03,424
I thought it was Potter.

869
00:55:03,788 --> 00:55:07,334
You were always dumb Quincy,
and remain true to form.

870
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:09,964
Seems an awful lot of sofky.

871
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:12,879
You boys looking for company?

872
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:16,222
That is our supper and breakfast both.

873
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,973
I like a big breakfast.

874
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:22,195
Sofky always cooks up
bigger than you think.

875
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,764
Rooster: And a good store of whiskey here as well.

876
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,597
What are you boys up to outside
of cooking banquets?

877
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,073
We were just having our supper.

878
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:32,604
We didn't know who was out there, weather like this.

879
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,708
Might have been some crazy man.

880
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:36,782
Anyone can say that he is a Marshall.

881
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:37,888
My leg hurts.

882
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:39,822
I bet it does.

883
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:48,027
When was the last time you see
your old pard, Ned Pepper?

884
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:51,265
I do not know him.
Who is he?

885
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,725
I'm surprised you don't remember him.

886
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:57,371
Skinny fellow, nervous and quick,
his lips all messed up.

887
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:00,186
That don't bring anybody to mind.

888
00:56:00,187 --> 00:56:01,585
There's a new boy.

889
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,822
Might be running with Ned.

890
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,472
He'll have a powder mark on his face,
black place.

891
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:10,322
Call's himself Chaney.

892
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:12,299
Or Chelmsford sometimes.

893
00:56:12,962 --> 00:56:14,750
Carries a Henry rifle.

894
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,968
That don't bring anybody to mind.

895
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,290
Black mark, I would remember that.

896
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:22,432
Rooster: You don't remember nothing
right now, do you Quincy?

897
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:25,467
What do you know, Moon?

898
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,570
He don't know those boys you're
looking for.

899
00:56:27,734 --> 00:56:29,943
I don't know those boys.

900
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:33,275
I always try to help out the law.

901
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:35,676
Know by the time I get to Fort Smith,

902
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:39,097
that leg will be swelled up tight
as Dick's hat band.

903
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:40,955
It'll be mortified.

904
00:56:40,956 --> 00:56:42,782
Then they'll have to cut it off.

905
00:56:42,783 --> 00:56:46,004
Then if you live, I will get you two or
three years in the federal house,

906
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,180
-up in Detroit, there.
-Trying to get at me.

907
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,205
They'll teach you how to read
and write up there.

908
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:53,408
The rest, won't be so good.

909
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,218
Them boys, they can be
hard on a gimp.

910
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:57,291
You're trying to get at me.

911
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,311
Now.

912
00:56:58,902 --> 00:57:01,547
You give me some good information
on Ned.

913
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:05,578
I'll take you down to Bagby store tomorrow,
and get that ball taken out of your leg.

914
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,228
Rooster: Then I'll give you three days to
clear the territory.

915
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:10,039
We don't know those boys
you're looking for.

916
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:14,563
-It ain't even his leg.
-I was...

917
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,077
Don't go flapping your mouth now, it's
best you let me do the talking.

918
00:57:17,078 --> 00:57:18,671
-I would say if I..
-We are weary trappers.

919
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,925
Who worked you over with the ugly stick?

920
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:25,621
The man Chaney with the marked face,
killed my father.

921
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:28,914
Mattie: He was a whiskey drinker like you
and I'd rather kill him in the end.

922
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:32,725
If you answer the Marshall's questions,
he will help you.

923
00:57:32,726 --> 00:57:34,985
I have a good lawyer, and I know
he will help you too.

924
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:37,860
I'm puzzled by this.

925
00:57:37,861 --> 00:57:39,544
Why is she here?

926
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:43,101
Don't go jawing with these people, Moon.
Don't you go jawing with that runt.

927
00:57:43,102 --> 00:57:46,884
I don't like you. I hope you go to jail
my lawyer will not help you.

928
00:57:46,885 --> 00:57:48,766
My leg is giving me fits.

929
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:51,331
A young fellow like don't want to loose his leg.

930
00:57:51,332 --> 00:57:52,769
Easy, now.

931
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,106
He's trying to get at you.

932
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,521
-With the truth.
-We seen Ned and Haze two days ago.

933
00:57:56,522 --> 00:57:59,075
Quincy: Don't you act the fool,
if you blow, I will kill you.

934
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,783
I'm played out, I need a doctor.

935
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:02,675
We met Ned and Haze two days ago.

936
00:58:17,821 --> 00:58:19,012
God damn it.

937
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:27,545
Moon: Oh Lord.

938
00:58:28,515 --> 00:58:29,679
I'm dying.

939
00:58:31,998 --> 00:58:33,071
Do something.

940
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,328
Help me.

941
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:36,629
I can do nothing for you, son.

942
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:39,669
Your partner's killed you, and I have done for him.

943
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,571
Don't leave me lying here.

944
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,075
Don't let the wolves rip me up.

945
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,079
I'll see you're buried right.

946
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,176
Tell me about Ned, where'd you see him?

947
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,502
Two days ago.

948
00:58:50,503 --> 00:58:51,776
Bagby's store.

949
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:57,621
They are coming here tonight
to get remounts and sofky.

950
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,959
They just robbed the Katy Flyer
at the Wagoner's switch.

951
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:03,323
Moon: I'm gone.

952
00:59:06,093 --> 00:59:08,822
Send the news to my brother, George Garrett.

953
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:12,856
He is a Methodist Circuit rider in south Texas.

954
00:59:12,857 --> 00:59:15,345
Shall I tell him you was outlawed up.

955
00:59:15,346 --> 00:59:16,482
Moon: It don't matter.

956
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:18,690
He knows I am on the scout.

957
00:59:20,615 --> 00:59:23,860
I will meet him later, walking
the streets of glory.

958
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:27,737
Well don't be looking for Quincy.

959
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:41,560
(Whispers) What will we do when they get here?

960
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:43,095
When they ride up,

961
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:45,426
what we want is to get them all in the dugout.

962
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:49,432
I'll kill them the last one that goes in,
then we'll have them in a barrel.

963
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,092
You will shoot them in the back?

964
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:54,023
Mmm, will give them the know
our intentions is serious.

965
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,005
Then I'll call down.

966
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:58,741
See if they'll be taken alive.

967
00:59:59,352 --> 01:00:01,341
If they won't.

968
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:03,027
I'll shoot them as they come out.

969
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:07,889
I'm hoping that three of their party being
dead will take the starch out of them.

970
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:12,230
You display great poise.

971
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:16,890
Aw, it's just a turkey shoot.

972
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,499
One time, in New Mexico,

973
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:25,478
we was being pursued by seven men.

974
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,712
I turned Bo around and taken them
reins in my teeth,

975
01:00:28,713 --> 01:00:32,634
rode right at them boys firing them
two navy-sixes I carry in my saddle.

976
01:00:33,582 --> 01:00:34,587
Well..

977
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:39,698
I guess they was all married men who loved their
families, as they scattered and run for home.

978
01:00:40,296 --> 01:00:41,715
That is hard to believe.

979
01:00:41,716 --> 01:00:44,351
-What is?
-One man riding at seven.

980
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:45,791
Well, it's true.

981
01:00:46,158 --> 01:00:48,699
You go for a man hard enough and fast enough,

982
01:00:48,814 --> 01:00:52,688
He don't have time to think about how
many is with him, he thinks about himself.

983
01:00:53,137 --> 01:00:56,176
And how he might get clear of that
wrath that's about to set down on him.

984
01:00:57,582 --> 01:00:58,668
Why were they pursuing you?

985
01:01:01,928 --> 01:01:03,740
I robbed a high interest bank.

986
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:06,510
Can't rob a thief, can you?

987
01:01:07,548 --> 01:01:09,078
Never robbed a citizen.

988
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:10,520
Never took a mans watch.

989
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:11,520
Mattie: It is all stealing.

990
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:14,720
That's the position they took
in New Mexico.

991
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:28,422
One man.

992
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:31,853
Did not figure them to send a scout.

993
01:01:50,102 --> 01:01:54,657
Damn

994
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:57,940
It is La Boeuf.

995
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,461
We have to warn him, Marshall.

996
01:02:13,492 --> 01:02:14,492
Too late.

997
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,467
What will we do, Marshall?

998
01:02:46,907 --> 01:02:49,234
We sit. What does he do?

999
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:11,661
Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.

1000
01:03:22,104 --> 01:03:23,562
Well, that's that.

1001
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:18,066
Well that didn't pan out.

1002
01:04:25,442 --> 01:04:27,828
You managed to put a kink
in my rope, partner.

1003
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:31,174
I am severely injured.

1004
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:33,148
Rooster: Yes, you got drug some.

1005
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,810
I was also shot.

1006
01:04:35,102 --> 01:04:36,438
By a rifle.

1007
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,823
That is quite possible. The scheme
did not developed as I had planned.

1008
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,514
You've been shot in the shoulder,
but the bullet passed through.

1009
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,243
What happened to your mouth?

1010
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:49,058
I believe I bit myself.

1011
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,362
Couple of teeth loose, and ah yeah.

1012
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,994
Tongue, bit almost through.

1013
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:57,742
Do you want to see if it will knit,
or should I just yank it free?

1014
01:04:58,206 --> 01:04:59,638
I know a teamster.

1015
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:01,628
Bit his tongue off being thrown
from a horse.

1016
01:05:01,629 --> 01:05:04,715
After a time he learned to make
himself more or less understood.

1017
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:05,808
I'll just yank it free.

1018
01:05:09,716 --> 01:05:10,877
What's that now?

1019
01:05:10,878 --> 01:05:12,772
Knit. Let it knit.

1020
01:05:12,773 --> 01:05:13,878
Ah, very well.

1021
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,168
It's impossible to bind
a tongue wound.

1022
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:19,879
To bad, we just run across a Doctor.

1023
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,681
-Mattie: Marshall?
-of sorts, but I do not know where
he was headed.

1024
01:05:22,682 --> 01:05:24,938
La Boeuf: I saw him too, that's how I came
to be here.

1025
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:27,590
Neither of these men are Chaney.

1026
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:29,765
Rooster: I know it, I know them both.

1027
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:32,395
That ugly one is Coke Hayes.

1028
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:35,465
Him uglier still is Clement Parmalee

1029
01:05:35,466 --> 01:05:39,905
Parmalee and his brothers have a silver
claim in the winding stair mountains.

1030
01:05:39,906 --> 01:05:42,438
And I bet that's where Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.

1031
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:43,818
Well, we'll sleep here.

1032
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,230
We'll follow in the morning.

1033
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,657
But we promised to bury
the poor soul inside.

1034
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:49,265
Grounds to hard.

1035
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:53,648
If them men wanted a decent burial,
they should have gotten themselves killed in summer.

1036
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,904
Sleep well, Little Blackie.

1037
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:02,967
I have a notion that tomorrow we will
reach our objective.

1038
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,125
We're hot on the trail.

1039
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:09,220
Seems that we'll overtake Tom
Chaney at winding stairs mountains.

1040
01:06:10,017 --> 01:06:11,756
I would not want to be in his shoes.

1041
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:26,981
La Boeuf: As I understand it, Chaney, or
Chelmsford, as he called himself in Texas.

1042
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:28,914
Shot the Senator's dog.

1043
01:06:29,174 --> 01:06:31,316
When the Senator remonstrated.

1044
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:32,803
Chelmsford shot him as well.

1045
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:38,176
Now you could argue that the shooting of
the dog was merely an instance of Malum prohibitum.

1046
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:41,956
But the shooting of the Senator is indubitably
an instance of Malum in se.

1047
01:06:42,282 --> 01:06:44,023
Rooster: Malla-men what?

1048
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:45,350
Malum in se.

1049
01:06:45,351 --> 01:06:48,634
The distinction is between an
act that is wrong in itself.

1050
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:51,914
And an act that is wrong only according
to our laws and mores.

1051
01:06:51,915 --> 01:06:53,087
It is Latin.

1052
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:56,148
I'm struck.

1053
01:06:56,335 --> 01:06:58,012
that La Boeuf.

1054
01:06:58,422 --> 01:07:01,820
has been shot, trampled.
and nearly severs his tongue.

1055
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:07,326
And not only does he not cease to talk.
But he spills the banks of English.

1056
01:07:12,185 --> 01:07:15,220
I was within three hundred yards of
Chelmsford once.

1057
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,117
The closest I have been.

1058
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,615
With a Sharps carbine that is within range.

1059
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:26,328
But I was mounted,
and had the choice of firing off hand.

1060
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,307
Or dismounting to shoot from rest.

1061
01:07:28,308 --> 01:07:31,255
which would allow Chelmsford to augment the distance.

1062
01:07:33,006 --> 01:07:34,430
I fired mounted,

1063
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,002
and fired wild.

1064
01:07:42,613 --> 01:07:47,446
You cannot  hit a man three hundred yards
if your gun was resting on Gibraltar.

1065
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:51,741
A Sharps carbine is an instrument of
uncanny balance and precision.

1066
01:07:51,742 --> 01:07:54,531
I have no doubt that the gun is sound.

1067
01:07:55,655 --> 01:08:00,059
<i>(Rooster Sings "Greer County")
*My clothes are all ragged and my language is rough.*</i>

1068
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,730
<i>*My bread is corn dodgers,
both solid and tough*</i>

1069
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:09,547
<i>*And yet I'm happy, and live at my ease*</i>

1070
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:13,865
<i>*On sorghum molasses, and bacon, and cheese*</i>

1071
01:08:13,866 --> 01:08:16,129
Greer county bantler.

1072
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:21,090
I do not believe he slept.

1073
01:08:29,374 --> 01:08:31,994
Fort Smith is a healthy distance, La Boeuf,

1074
01:08:31,995 --> 01:08:34,178
But I would encourage the creature you ride,

1075
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:38,655
to heads over. Out here
a one-armed man looks like easy prey.

1076
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:42,194
And a one eyed man who can't shoot.

1077
01:08:42,195 --> 01:08:44,143
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?

1078
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:45,427
I'll do fine.

1079
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:52,343
I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I'm uninjured,
well provisioned and we agreed to separate.

1080
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:56,685
In conscious you cannot shy our agreement.
You're the one who shot me.

1081
01:08:56,686 --> 01:08:58,733
Mr. La Boeuf has a point, Marshall.

1082
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:02,239
It is an unfair leg up in any competition
to shoot your opposite member.

1083
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:05,966
God damn it. I do not accept it as
a given that I did shoot La Boeuf.

1084
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:07,990
There were plenty of guns going off.

1085
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:10,379
I heard the rifle, and I felt the ball.

1086
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,235
La Boeuf: You missed your shot, Cogburn.

1087
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:13,634
Missed my shot!

1088
01:09:13,635 --> 01:09:17,407
You are more handicapped without the eye,
then I without the arm.

1089
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,224
I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards.

1090
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:34,687
That Chinaman is running
them cheap shells on me again.

1091
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:37,027
I thought you were going to say,
the sun was in your eyes.

1092
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:40,331
That is to say, "your eye".

1093
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:26,635
Rooster: Two at one time.

1094
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,488
I'm going to chuck one high.

1095
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,664
Go far.

1096
01:10:53,232 --> 01:10:55,434
-There.
-There?

1097
01:10:55,435 --> 01:10:57,610
-My bullet.
-La Boeuf: Your bullet?

1098
01:10:57,614 --> 01:11:00,574
If you hit what you aim at,
explain my shoulder.

1099
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:04,617
Gentlemen, shooting corn bread out here on the prairie
is getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang.

1100
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:07,057
One more. This will prove it.

1101
01:11:07,058 --> 01:11:08,738
Please hold fire.

1102
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,558
Rooster: Find our way back.

1103
01:12:50,895 --> 01:12:51,895
Lucky Ned?

1104
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:04,764
Rooster screams: LUCKY NED!

1105
01:13:07,272 --> 01:13:08,979
La Boeuf: Very good, Cogburn.

1106
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,277
Now what?

1107
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,225
Oh, god damn it.

1108
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,768
Cogburn did not want me
eating out of his store.

1109
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,673
That is silly, you have not eaten the whole day.
It is my store not his.

1110
01:13:24,674 --> 01:13:26,296
Let him starve.

1111
01:13:28,277 --> 01:13:29,982
He does not track.

1112
01:13:29,983 --> 01:13:31,154
He does not shoot.

1113
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,120
except at food stuffs.

1114
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:35,958
-That was your initiative.
-He does not contribute.

1115
01:13:36,313 --> 01:13:40,089
A man, who walks in front of bullets.

1116
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,839
Mr. La Boeuf drew single handed
upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang,

1117
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,328
while we fired safely from cover.

1118
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:47,306
-We?
-It is unfair to indict a man,

1119
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:51,712
when his jaw is swollen, and tongue mangled
and who is therefore unable to rise to his own defense.

1120
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:53,025
I can speak for myself.

1121
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:58,376
I am hardly obliged to answer the ravings
of a drunkard, who is beneath me.

1122
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,407
I shall  make my own camp.

1123
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:03,454
Elsewhere.

1124
01:14:04,624 --> 01:14:07,347
It is you who has nothing to
offer, Cogburn.

1125
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:09,589
A sad picture indeed.

1126
01:14:09,856 --> 01:14:11,914
La Boeuf: This is no longer a man hunt.

1127
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,299
It is a debauch.

1128
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:15,432
The Texas Ranger.

1129
01:14:15,433 --> 01:14:17,658
Presses on, alone.

1130
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:21,424
Take the girl.

1131
01:14:21,425 --> 01:14:22,663
I bow out.

1132
01:14:25,305 --> 01:14:28,883
A fine thing to decide once you brought her
into the middle of the Choctaw nation.

1133
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:30,773
I bow out, I wash my hands.

1134
01:14:30,775 --> 01:14:32,795
Gentlemen we cannot fall out in this fashion.

1135
01:14:32,799 --> 01:14:35,718
Not so close to our goal, with
Tom Chaney nearly in hand.

1136
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:37,828
Rooster: In hand?

1137
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:42,272
If he is not in a shallow grave
somewhere between here and Fort Smith,

1138
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:43,636
he is gone.

1139
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:45,248
Long gone.

1140
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:49,037
Rooster: Thanks to Mr. La Boeuf, we missed our shot.

1141
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:51,667
We have barked, and the birds have flown.

1142
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,712
Gone, gone, gone.

1143
01:14:54,064 --> 01:14:56,312
Lucky Ned and his cohort's gone.

1144
01:14:56,313 --> 01:14:58,098
Your fifty dollars, gone.

1145
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:59,579
Gone the whiskey,

1146
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,341
seized in evidence.

1147
01:15:02,124 --> 01:15:04,597
The trail is cold, if there ever was one.

1148
01:15:07,696 --> 01:15:13,940
I'm....I'm a foolish old man who's been
drawn into a wild goose chase,

1149
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:18,370
by a harpy in trousers,
and a nincompoop.

1150
01:15:19,103 --> 01:15:21,752
Well, Mr. La Boeuf.

1151
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:24,946
He can wander the Choctaw nation
for as long as he likes.

1152
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:27,439
Perhaps the local Indians will take him in.

1153
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:30,514
and honor his gibbering by making him Chief.

1154
01:15:31,644 --> 01:15:34,250
You sister, may go where you like.

1155
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:37,525
Our engagement is terminated.

1156
01:15:39,617 --> 01:15:40,962
I bow out.

1157
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:49,984
I am going with you.

1158
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:52,430
Oh, that is not possible.

1159
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:54,135
Have I held you back?

1160
01:15:54,893 --> 01:15:57,982
I have a Colt Dragoon revolver,
and I know how to use it.

1161
01:15:58,281 --> 01:16:00,916
And I will be no more of a burden to you,
as I was to the Marshall.

1162
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,183
That's not my worry.

1163
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,489
You've earned your spurs.

1164
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:05,605
That is clear now.

1165
01:16:06,266 --> 01:16:09,383
You've been an regular
old hand on the trail.

1166
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:12,310
But Cogburn's right.

1167
01:16:12,312 --> 01:16:15,165
Even if I would not give him
the satisfaction of conceding it.

1168
01:16:16,812 --> 01:16:18,348
The trail is cold.

1169
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:21,606
And I am,

1170
01:16:22,562 --> 01:16:24,398
considerably diminished.

1171
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:28,260
How can you give up now. After the many months
you've dedicated to finding Chaney?

1172
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:31,087
You have shown great determination.

1173
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:34,120
I misjudged you.

1174
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:39,561
I picked the wrong man.

1175
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:46,833
I would go on in your company,
if there were a clear way to go.

1176
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,852
But we'd be striking out blindly.

1177
01:16:52,581 --> 01:16:53,928
Chelmsford's gone.

1178
01:16:55,513 --> 01:16:57,406
We chased him right off the map.

1179
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,276
There's nothing for him.

1180
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:06,230
I'm bound for Texas.

1181
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,458
Time for you to go home, too.

1182
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:12,708
The Marshall, when he sobers.

1183
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:15,776
Is your way back.

1184
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,592
I will not go back. Not without Chaney,
dead or alive.

1185
01:17:22,286 --> 01:17:24,064
I misjudged you as well.

1186
01:17:27,216 --> 01:17:28,798
I extend my hand.

1187
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:31,047
Mr. La Boeuf, please.

1188
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:45,329
Adios.

1189
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,134
I know you.

1190
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:39,858
Your name is, Mattie.

1191
01:19:39,937 --> 01:19:42,283
Chaney: Why you're little Mattie, the bookkeeper.

1192
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,510
Isn't this something.

1193
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:47,125
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.

1194
01:19:50,129 --> 01:19:51,481
What you doing out here?

1195
01:19:51,851 --> 01:19:53,136
Come to fetch some water.

1196
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,327
No, what are you doing in these mountains, here?

1197
01:19:55,328 --> 01:19:57,209
While I have not been formerly deputized,

1198
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,386
but I'm acting as an agent for,
Marshall Rooster Cogburn,

1199
01:19:59,387 --> 01:20:00,638
and Judge Fockers court.

1200
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:08,955
I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.

1201
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:16,387
Well I will not go.

1202
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:17,392
Chaney: How do you like that?

1203
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,576
There's a posse of officers up the hill
that will force you to go.

1204
01:20:21,027 --> 01:20:22,867
That is interesting news.

1205
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:24,035
And how many is up there?

1206
01:20:24,525 --> 01:20:25,808
Right around fifty.

1207
01:20:26,216 --> 01:20:28,053
They're all well armed and they mean business.

1208
01:20:28,764 --> 01:20:32,066
What I want you to do now, is to come
on across the creek and walk in front of me up that hill.

1209
01:20:32,797 --> 01:20:36,161
I think I will oblige the officers who's
come after me.

1210
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,065
Well if you refuse to go, then
I will have to shoot you.

1211
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:40,734
Oh.

1212
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:43,011
Well you had better cock your piece.

1213
01:20:44,696 --> 01:20:46,369
All the way back.

1214
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:49,946
-Chaney: Until it locks.
-I know how to do it.

1215
01:20:50,616 --> 01:20:51,883
You will not go with me?

1216
01:20:51,884 --> 01:20:53,377
Naw, it's just the other way around.

1217
01:20:53,378 --> 01:20:54,630
You're going with me.

1218
01:20:55,196 --> 01:20:56,196
I'm...AAAH!

1219
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:07,519
I did not think you would do it.

1220
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,861
-What do you think now?
-One of my short ribs is broken.

1221
01:21:10,862 --> 01:21:13,269
You killed my father when he was trying to help you.

1222
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:16,590
I have one of the gold pieces you stole
from him. Now give me the other.

1223
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:17,886
-Things aren't going right for me.
-Rooster: MATTIE!

1224
01:21:17,887 --> 01:21:19,361
I'm down here.

1225
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:20,979
Now I'm shot by a child.

1226
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,579
Chaney's taken into custody.

1227
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:30,118
Mattie: Help me.

1228
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,144
MATTIE!

1229
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:35,092
Mattie: Marshall.

1230
01:21:42,036 --> 01:21:43,675
Man: Take them horses you got, and move.

1231
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,889
Tom, get up on that hill, don't you stop.

1232
01:21:55,598 --> 01:21:56,692
What's down there?

1233
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:58,657
Marshall Cogburn and fifty more officers.

1234
01:22:05,093 --> 01:22:07,502
You tell me another lie and I'll
stove your head in.

1235
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:09,527
Just the Marshall.

1236
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:12,687
Rooster.

1237
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:15,823
Cogburn!

1238
01:22:16,408 --> 01:22:17,671
You hear me?

1239
01:22:20,905 --> 01:22:22,550
You answer me, Rooster.

1240
01:22:23,723 --> 01:22:25,289
I will kill this girl.

1241
01:22:25,682 --> 01:22:26,996
You know I will do it.

1242
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,068
Rooster: The girl is nothing to me,
she's a runaway from Arkansas.

1243
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,814
That is all very well.

1244
01:22:34,072 --> 01:22:36,219
Do you advise that I kill her?

1245
01:22:39,008 --> 01:22:40,827
Do what you think is best, Ned.

1246
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,552
She's nothing to me but a lost child.

1247
01:22:46,653 --> 01:22:47,957
Think it over, first.

1248
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,902
I have already thought it over.

1249
01:22:50,077 --> 01:22:52,336
You'll get mounted double fast.

1250
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:55,757
If I see you riding over
that bald ridge to the northwest.

1251
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,187
I will spare the girl.

1252
01:22:57,893 --> 01:22:59,427
You have five minutes.

1253
01:22:59,428 --> 01:23:02,204
They will be a party
of Marshall’s here soon, Ned.

1254
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:06,779
Let me have the girl and Chaney
and I will mislead them for six hours.

1255
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,517
Too thin, Rooster.

1256
01:23:08,518 --> 01:23:09,568
Too thin.

1257
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:11,998
Your five minutes is running.

1258
01:23:11,999 --> 01:23:13,590
No more talk.

1259
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:18,504
Run up that hill.

1260
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,180
(Man gobbles like turkey)

1261
01:23:23,426 --> 01:23:24,426
(Man continues to gobble like turkey)

1262
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:28,079
(Man moo's like a cow)

1263
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:32,228
Farrell, see to Tom's wound.

1264
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:34,226
Can I have some of that bacon?

1265
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:35,321
You can help yourself.

1266
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:37,188
They'll soon be coffee.

1267
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,403
I do not drink Coffee, I am fourteen.

1268
01:23:40,112 --> 01:23:43,285
Well we do not have buttermilk,
and we do not have bread.

1269
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,160
We are poorly supplied.

1270
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:46,984
-Where is she?
-What are you doing here?

1271
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:48,742
I aught to ring your scrawny neck.

1272
01:23:48,743 --> 01:23:49,819
You let that go.

1273
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,410
What happened, huh?

1274
01:23:53,415 --> 01:23:55,779
I will tell you, and you will see that
I am in the right.

1275
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,941
Tom Chaney there shot my father to death,

1276
01:23:57,942 --> 01:23:59,020
at Fort Smith and robbed him of..

1277
01:23:59,021 --> 01:24:00,852
two gold pieces and stole his mare.

1278
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,159
I was informed that Mr. Cogburn had grit, and
I hired him to find the murderer.

1279
01:24:04,426 --> 01:24:07,211
Moments ago I came upon Chaney watering the horses.

1280
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:09,163
Mattie: He would not be taken in charge and I shot him.

1281
01:24:09,993 --> 01:24:13,286
If I had killed him I would not now
be in this fix, but my revolver misfired.

1282
01:24:14,557 --> 01:24:15,602
That will do it.

1283
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,918
It will embarrass you every time.

1284
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:21,850
Most girls like to play pretties,
but you like guns, do you?

1285
01:24:21,851 --> 01:24:25,189
I do not care a thing in the world about guns.
If I did I would have one that worked.

1286
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,118
I was shot in an ambush, Ned.

1287
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:30,082
The Horses were blowing and making noise, it was that officer that got me.

1288
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:32,214
How can you sit there and tell such a big story?

1289
01:24:32,215 --> 01:24:34,970
That pit is a hundred feet deep,
and I will throw you in it,

1290
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:37,218
and leave you to scream and rot.

1291
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:39,090
-How do you like that?
-No you won't.

1292
01:24:39,091 --> 01:24:42,005
This man will not let you have your way. He's your boss
and you have to do as he tells you.

1293
01:24:43,196 --> 01:24:44,885
Aw, nothings going my way.

1294
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:48,013
Was that Rooster that waylaid us
the night before last?

1295
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,720
It was Marshall Cogburn and myself.

1296
01:24:50,095 --> 01:24:51,374
You and, Cogburn.

1297
01:24:52,307 --> 01:24:53,593
Quite the posse.

1298
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,349
Let us move, Ned.

1299
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,676
In good time, Doctor.

1300
01:25:15,138 --> 01:25:16,719
What happened to Quincy, and the kid?

1301
01:25:19,226 --> 01:25:20,266
They are both dead.

1302
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,323
I was in the very middle of it,
it was a terrible thing to see.

1303
01:25:24,403 --> 01:25:26,262
Please, let us move, Ned.

1304
01:25:26,263 --> 01:25:27,796
The Marshall's gone.

1305
01:25:27,797 --> 01:25:29,101
Do you need a good lawyer?

1306
01:25:29,632 --> 01:25:31,179
I need a good judge.

1307
01:25:32,162 --> 01:25:33,748
What happened to Coke Hayes?

1308
01:25:33,749 --> 01:25:35,356
The old fellow shot off his horse.

1309
01:25:35,725 --> 01:25:37,099
Dead as well.

1310
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:39,751
His depredations have come to an end.

1311
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:43,261
Your friend Rooster does
not collect many prisoners.

1312
01:25:43,262 --> 01:25:44,487
He is not my friend.

1313
01:25:46,687 --> 01:25:49,040
He has abandoned me to a congress of louts.

1314
01:25:49,298 --> 01:25:51,267
You do not varnish your opinion.

1315
01:25:52,135 --> 01:25:53,321
Are we off?

1316
01:25:53,322 --> 01:25:55,860
Let us cut up the winnings from the Katy Flyer.

1317
01:25:55,861 --> 01:25:57,690
They'll be time for that at the old place.

1318
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,241
I will mount the grey.

1319
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:00,489
I have other plans for you.

1320
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,610
Must I double mount with the doctor?

1321
01:26:02,611 --> 01:26:03,932
-Doctor: No.
-Nope.

1322
01:26:03,933 --> 01:26:06,246
it will be too chancy with two
men up if it comes to a race.

1323
01:26:06,472 --> 01:26:08,202
You will wait here with the girl.

1324
01:26:08,314 --> 01:26:10,172
When we reach Ma's house I'll send Carroll

1325
01:26:10,173 --> 01:26:11,529
back here with some fresh mounts.

1326
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,900
We'll be out by dark.

1327
01:26:13,526 --> 01:26:14,769
We'll meet you at the old place.

1328
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,373
Chaney: I do not like that.

1329
01:26:16,481 --> 01:26:19,717
Let me ride with you, Ned.
Just out here anyway.

1330
01:26:19,718 --> 01:26:20,914
I was short a horse.

1331
01:26:20,915 --> 01:26:22,588
The Marshall’s will come swarming.

1332
01:26:22,589 --> 01:26:24,177
Hours, if they come here at all.

1333
01:26:24,299 --> 01:26:25,806
They'll think that we've all gone.

1334
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:28,314
Mattie: I am not staying here
by myself with, Tom Chaney.

1335
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:29,784
That's the way I will have it.

1336
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:30,912
Mattie: He will kill me.

1337
01:26:30,915 --> 01:26:34,355
You heard him say it. He's killed my father,
and now you will let him kill me.

1338
01:26:34,574 --> 01:26:36,066
He will do no such thing.

1339
01:26:36,213 --> 01:26:40,814
Tom, you know the crossing at the cypress forks
near the log meeting house?

1340
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:43,559
Lucky Ned: When your mounted, you take
the girl and leave her there.

1341
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:45,130
You understand, Tom?

1342
01:26:45,315 --> 01:26:47,750
Any harm comes to that child,

1343
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:49,382
you'll not get paid.

1344
01:26:52,049 --> 01:26:54,678
Harold, let me ride up with you.

1345
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:58,952
(Baa's like goat in reply)
Farrel, I will pay you fifty dollars out of my winnings.

1346
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:00,426
I am not heavy.

1347
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:02,546
Do the calf again, Harold.

1348
01:27:02,838 --> 01:27:03,838
Mooooo.

1349
01:27:30,555 --> 01:27:32,101
Everything is against me.

1350
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,434
You have no reason to whine.

1351
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:38,340
You act as the bandit Chief instructed
and no harm comes to me,

1352
01:27:38,341 --> 01:27:39,842
you will get your winnings at the old place.

1353
01:27:40,026 --> 01:27:43,832
Lucky Ned has left me alone. I am sure
to be caught, when I leave on foot.

1354
01:27:44,672 --> 01:27:47,524
Must think over my position
and how I may improve it.

1355
01:27:47,995 --> 01:27:50,320
Where's the second California gold piece?

1356
01:27:53,046 --> 01:27:54,398
What have you done with Papa's mare?

1357
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:55,686
Keep still.

1358
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,192
Are you thinking about the old place?

1359
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:00,648
Look here, if you let me go.

1360
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:02,070
I will swear to an affidavit...

1361
01:28:02,071 --> 01:28:04,605
and once you are brought to justice,
it may go easier on you.

1362
01:28:07,442 --> 01:28:09,473
I tell you I can do better.

1363
01:28:15,846 --> 01:28:17,963
I don't need no affidavit.

1364
01:28:23,635 --> 01:28:25,539
All I need is your silence.

1365
01:28:30,391 --> 01:28:32,829
Your father was a busybody like you.

1366
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:35,334
In honesty, I do not regret
shooting him.

1367
01:28:35,641 --> 01:28:37,609
He thought Tom Chaney was small.

1368
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:39,368
You and him.

1369
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:41,313
You will give me an affidavit.

1370
01:28:41,314 --> 01:28:43,270
You're all against me, everybody....

1371
01:28:49,234 --> 01:28:50,964
La Boeuf: That is, Chelmsford.

1372
01:28:52,519 --> 01:28:54,912
Strange to be so close to him at last.

1373
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:58,077
Mr. La Boeuf, how is it that you are here?

1374
01:28:58,696 --> 01:28:59,887
I heard a shot.

1375
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:01,629
Went down to the river.

1376
01:29:02,267 --> 01:29:04,141
Cogburn outlined a plan.

1377
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:06,575
Mind your foot, there's a pit there.

1378
01:29:07,334 --> 01:29:08,532
His part,

1379
01:29:09,013 --> 01:29:10,636
I fear is rash.

1380
01:29:13,021 --> 01:29:15,131
La Boeuf: He returns for Lucky Ned.

1381
01:29:32,297 --> 01:29:33,545
Well, Rooster!

1382
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,970
Will you give us the road?

1383
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,721
One against four, it is ill advised.

1384
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,945
La Boeuf: He would not be dissuaded.

1385
01:29:40,946 --> 01:29:43,822
Rooster: Hello Ned, how many men is with the girl?

1386
01:29:44,365 --> 01:29:45,729
Lucky Ned: Just Chaney.

1387
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:47,476
Our agreement is in force.

1388
01:29:47,831 --> 01:29:50,835
She was in excellent health,
when last I saw her.

1389
01:29:51,737 --> 01:29:55,689
Farrel, I want you and your brother
to stay clear.

1390
01:29:56,538 --> 01:29:58,053
You as well, Doctor.

1391
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:00,550
Have no interest in you today.

1392
01:30:01,686 --> 01:30:03,574
What is your intention, Rooster?

1393
01:30:03,949 --> 01:30:06,197
You think one on four is a dog fall?

1394
01:30:06,759 --> 01:30:09,449
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1395
01:30:10,047 --> 01:30:13,997
Rooster: Or see you hanged at Fort Smith
at Judge Parker's convenience.

1396
01:30:14,788 --> 01:30:16,254
Which will you have?

1397
01:30:17,183 --> 01:30:19,270
I call that, bold talk.

1398
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:22,511
From a one-eyed fat man.

1399
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:25,617
(Harold clucks like chicken, then
crows like a rooster)

1400
01:30:25,789 --> 01:30:28,451
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch.

1401
01:30:43,599 --> 01:30:44,922
Shoot them Mr. La Boeuf.

1402
01:30:44,925 --> 01:30:47,198
To far, moving to fast.

1403
01:31:29,031 --> 01:31:30,275
Well, Rooster?

1404
01:31:32,085 --> 01:31:33,681
I'm shot to pieces.

1405
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,024
Seems neither of us,

1406
01:31:37,486 --> 01:31:39,359
gets to see Judge Parker.

1407
01:32:01,426 --> 01:32:04,585
Mattie: Wahooo!
Some bully shot.

1408
01:32:04,475 --> 01:32:06,527
That was four hundred yards at least.

1409
01:32:07,551 --> 01:32:08,551
La Boeuf: Well,

1410
01:32:09,585 --> 01:32:11,635
the Sharps carbine, is a...

1411
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:27,757
Stand up, Tom Chaney.

1412
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,999
M...Mr. La Boeuf

1413
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:12,615
Are you alive?

1414
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,231
Mr. La Boeuf!

1415
01:34:32,101 --> 01:34:33,702
Mr. La Boeuf.

1416
01:34:35,522 --> 01:34:36,921
Mr. La Boeuf.

1417
01:34:40,669 --> 01:34:41,669
Rooster: Are you there?

1418
01:34:42,704 --> 01:34:43,704
I'm here.

1419
01:34:43,705 --> 01:34:45,125
Rooster: Can you clamber out?

1420
01:34:45,357 --> 01:34:46,357
I cannot.

1421
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:47,844
There are snakes.

1422
01:34:47,845 --> 01:34:49,117
Rooster: They awake?

1423
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:50,360
Mattie: Not yet.

1424
01:35:03,566 --> 01:35:04,619
I'm bit.

1425
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:16,615
Does Mr. La Boeuf survive?

1426
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,988
He does. Even a blow to the head
could silence him for only a few short minutes.

1427
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:22,345
Where you bit?

1428
01:35:28,154 --> 01:35:29,518
Look away, Mattie.

1429
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:57,483
I have her.

1430
01:35:57,484 --> 01:35:58,963
Up with us.

1431
01:36:05,757 --> 01:36:08,027
Rooster: Here Mr. La Boeuf, take her.

1432
01:36:09,643 --> 01:36:10,916
She's snake bit.

1433
01:36:13,808 --> 01:36:14,751
Rooster: We are off.

1434
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:17,258
I'll send help for you as soon as I can.

1435
01:36:17,588 --> 01:36:18,702
Don't wander off.

1436
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,288
We are not leaving him.

1437
01:36:22,181 --> 01:36:24,766
I must get you to a Doctor, Sis.
You are not going to make it.

1438
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:27,282
I'm your debt for that shot, pard.

1439
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,970
Never doubt the Texas Ranger.

1440
01:36:29,494 --> 01:36:30,500
Come on.

1441
01:36:32,152 --> 01:36:33,504
Ever stalwart.

1442
01:37:36,266 --> 01:37:37,391
We must stop.

1443
01:37:37,871 --> 01:37:39,556
Little Blackie is played out.

1444
01:37:40,668 --> 01:37:41,799
We've miles yet.

1445
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:44,668
Come on you.

1446
01:37:45,515 --> 01:37:46,515
NO!

1447
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,350
No.

1448
01:37:49,354 --> 01:37:50,761
That's it, come on now.

1449
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:52,832
Mattie: No, stop.

1450
01:38:14,227 --> 01:38:15,639
He's getting away.

1451
01:38:16,127 --> 01:38:17,384
Who's getting, sis?

1452
01:38:18,612 --> 01:38:19,612
Chaney.

1453
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:56,747
Mattie cries: No.. NO!

1454
01:38:57,043 --> 01:38:58,816
Mattie shouts: NO, no, no.

1455
01:39:00,664 --> 01:39:01,799
Sobs: Oh, no.

1456
01:39:07,384 --> 01:39:08,680
No, stop.

1457
01:40:35,928 --> 01:40:37,725
I've grown old.

1458
01:40:59,724 --> 01:41:02,083
(Grown up Mattie narrates)
A quarter century is a long time.

1459
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:19,256
By the time we reached Bagby's store,

1460
01:41:19,257 --> 01:41:20,892
my hand had turned black.

1461
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:23,933
I was not awake when I lost the arm.

1462
01:41:27,318 --> 01:41:29,770
The Marshall had stayed with me, I was told.

1463
01:41:29,771 --> 01:41:31,126
until I was out of danger.

1464
01:41:31,507 --> 01:41:33,555
But he departed before I came around.

1465
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:37,138
Once home. I wrote him with an invitation,

1466
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:40,114
to come by, the next time he found
himself near Yell county.

1467
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:43,205
And collect the fifty dollars I still owed him.

1468
01:41:44,112 --> 01:41:46,059
I did not hear back from Marshall Cogburn.

1469
01:41:46,374 --> 01:41:47,767
And he did not appear.

1470
01:41:50,096 --> 01:41:54,167
Then one day I received a note from
the Marshall, with a flyer enclosed.

1471
01:41:56,255 --> 01:41:58,713
He said he was traveling with the Wild West show.

1472
01:41:58,907 --> 01:42:00,349
Getting older and fatter.

1473
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:03,872
Would I like to come visit him
when the show came to Memphis,

1474
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:06,242
and swap stories with an old trail mate.

1475
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:10,148
He would understand if the journey were to long.

1476
01:42:14,225 --> 01:42:16,035
Brief though his note was.

1477
01:42:16,792 --> 01:42:18,596
It was rife with misspellings.

1478
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:21,060
Yes'm?

1479
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:22,947
I am, Cole Younger.

1480
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:25,222
This is Mr. James.

1481
01:42:26,754 --> 01:42:30,065
It grieves me to tell you that you have missed, Rooster.

1482
01:42:30,643 --> 01:42:33,043
He passed away three days ago.

1483
01:42:33,044 --> 01:42:35,510
When the show was at Jonesboro, Arkansas.

1484
01:42:35,933 --> 01:42:38,491
Buried him there at a Confederate cemetery.

1485
01:42:40,228 --> 01:42:44,115
Ruben had a complaint what he referred to as,
"Night hoss".

1486
01:42:44,286 --> 01:42:47,540
And I believe the warm weather was to much for him.

1487
01:42:49,008 --> 01:42:51,697
We had some lively times.

1488
01:42:52,924 --> 01:42:55,543
What was the nature of your acquaintance?

1489
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:58,704
I knew the Marshall long ago.

1490
01:42:59,522 --> 01:43:02,697
We too had, lively times.

1491
01:43:04,769 --> 01:43:06,093
Thank you, Mr. Younger.

1492
01:43:08,749 --> 01:43:10,449
Keep your seat, trash.

1493
01:43:12,738 --> 01:43:16,639
Mattie Narrates: I had the body removed to
our plot and I had visited it over the years.

1494
01:43:21,555 --> 01:43:23,395
No doubt people talk about that.

1495
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:27,141
They say, "Well, she hardly knew the man".

1496
01:43:27,269 --> 01:43:29,466
"Isn't she a cranky old maid".

1497
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:32,827
It is true, I have not married.

1498
01:43:32,828 --> 01:43:34,752
I never had time to fool with it.

1499
01:43:38,118 --> 01:43:41,123
I heard nothing more of the Texas
officer, La Boeuf.

1500
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:44,580
If he is yet alive. I would be pleased
to hear from him.

1501
01:43:45,289 --> 01:43:47,497
I judge he would be in his seventies now.

1502
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,360
And nearer eighty than seventy.

1503
01:43:50,310 --> 01:43:53,540
I expect some of the starch has gone
out of that cowlick.

1504
01:43:55,515 --> 01:43:57,350
Time just gets away from us.

1505
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:11,828
<i>*"Leaning on the ever lasting arms"
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,*</i>

1506
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:17,727
