1
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Ba.

2
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,167
Ba! Ba!

3
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,583
Ba, ba, ba.

4
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,500
- Bye.
- Ba, ba.

5
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,458
A pile of organs without the
spark of self from a brain,

6
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,708
or the pump of
blood from a heart.

7
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,708
Just a butcher's tray
for a Sunday lunch.

8
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,625
Now, who would like to
reconstruct the organs?

9
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:10,792
And who can tell human from
animal, if there is a difference?

10
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,958
Come, come.

11
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,833
You did puzzles as
children, did you not?

12
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,292
Is it just me, or is it devilishly hard
to concentrate when the monster's talking?

13
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,500
He is an extraordinary surgeon.

14
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,583
His research is groundbreaking.
His father founded this place.

15
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,500
Have you mistaken yourself as included
in this conversation, Max McCandles?

16
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,083
Your physical proximity
to us does not make it so.

17
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,667
Fuck off, old pal.
Get yourself a suit.

18
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,667
You really think that's
where the liver goes, sir?

19
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,500
Can I ask what is the purpose
of putting them back in, sir?

20
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,250
My amusement.

21
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,167
Mr. Max McCandles!

22
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,625
Walk with me at the
end of the lesson.

23
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,333
Your paper.

24
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,417
You liked it, sir?

25
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:10,583
It showed signs of a conventional mind
straining hard to almost touch mediocrity.

26
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,417
- Thank you.
- I need someone. An assistant on a project.

27
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,583
I would love to.

28
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,417
- Are you a religious man?
- I believe in God.

29
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,625
- Me or the deity?
- Humorous, as you're often known as the...

30
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,250
It is a joke of my own making.

31
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,583
I do not need it
explicated for me.

32
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,750
The very devil's work.

33
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,625
Have you thought of
growing a beard, sir?

34
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,917
I look like a big
dog in a cravat.

35
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,292
Kids like dogs.

36
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,042
This job.

37
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,583
Yes. Come.

38
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,167
God! God.

39
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,375
God.

40
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,708
- Hello.
- Hello.

41
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,375
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

42
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,000
Hello, Bella.

43
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,208
- Bud.
- Blood.

44
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
- Bud.
- Blood.

45
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,292
- Blood.
- Marvelous.

46
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,667
I'm fine. I'm fine.

47
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,625
What a very pretty retard.

48
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,958
She suffered a brain injury.

49
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,333
I repaired it.

50
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,833
Her mental age and her body
are not quite synchronized.

51
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,250
Language is coming. She is
progressing at an accelerated pace.

52
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,708
She is stunning.

53
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,917
I need to meticulously
note her progression.

54
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
You will do this for me?

55
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,250
It would be my honor.

56
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,375
Wee!

57
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,417
Wee!

58
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,458
Yes. It is exciting, Bella.

59
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,167
"Wee." I believe she's doing...

60
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,708
Mrs. Prim!

61
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,833
Wee.

62
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,792
Do you not like kippers?

63
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,375
I am quite partial
to them, actually.

64
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,000
I find them to be
nice in the morning...

65
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,833
Bella cut, too?

66
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Just dead ones for Bella.

67
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,000
Just dead.

68
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,333
Just dead.

69
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Just dead.

70
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,292
Squish! Squish, squish.

71
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,875
Chog!

72
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,083
Chog!

73
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,167
Run!

74
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,042
Chog.

75
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,083
<i>She gathers 15 words a day.</i>

76
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,583
<i>Her coordination is
unstable at best.</i>

77
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,333
<i>In the evenings,
there's progress.</i>

78
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,167
<i>Her hair grows one
inch every two days.</i>

79
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,333
<i>- I have a hair diagram here.
- Excellent.</i>

80
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,250
You may go. See you tomorrow.

81
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,250
Sir, where did she come from?

82
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,000
I believe your job
is collecting data.

83
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,583
When I add inane questions
to it, I'll let you know.

84
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,125
"And so, when they
returned from the wood

85
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:19,917
"she was reunited with
her Mummy and Daddy."

86
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,417
"That night, for dinner, they
ate cake until they were sick."

87
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,625
"They were so happy
to be back together."

88
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,417
You me Daddy, God?

89
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
- I...
- Prim say you not be.

90
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,042
Bella nowhere girl.

91
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,875
Where that be? Nowhere?

92
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,208
You are an orphan.

93
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,375
Your parents died.

94
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,458
Then you cut parents up, God?

95
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,625
No.

96
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,042
They were my friends.

97
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,583
They were brave explorers,

98
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,667
and they were killed in a
landslide in South America.

99
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,958
They pushed the boundaries
of what was known,

100
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,875
and they paid the price.

101
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,750
But that is the only
way to live, Bella.

102
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,917
They sent you to
me to care for you.

103
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,333
Dead?

104
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm afraid so, my darling.

105
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,042
Poor Bella.

106
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,583
But love God.

107
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,708
Sleep here.

108
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,667
No.

109
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:55,417
Good night, dear Bella.

110
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,500
This, parents.

111
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,625
Peru, yes.

112
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,125
Why you pen book every nut?

113
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,458
I must note down your
nutritional intake.

114
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,750
How many?

115
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,833
Tell Bella other places.

116
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,333
That's Lisbon, Portugal.

117
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,250
The south of France. The Alps.

118
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,875
Australia.

119
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,958
Far away and dangerous,
in both people and animal.

120
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,292
Bella want look at world.

121
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,125
Just...

122
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:49,917
Bella.

123
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,333
Bella, I don't think
we're allowed up here.

124
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,542
Let's just...

125
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,417
Bella.

126
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Bella.

127
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No.

128
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,792
Bella, this is dangerous.

129
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,750
Bella.

130
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,292
No, Bella.

131
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,667
God.

132
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,250
Outside must go.

133
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,167
Outside? No, we work.

134
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,833
Cut fingers?

135
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,958
Candles take me. Candles.

136
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,375
Of course I can. If...

137
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,708
No.

138
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,042
Yes. Out!

139
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,958
Has she ever been outside?

140
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,125
No.

141
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,792
I have created a perfectly
entertaining and safe world for Bella.

142
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,458
Now.

143
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,250
- Bella.
- Now!

144
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,375
Now!

145
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,458
Bella.

146
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,667
You know, so many things
outside can kill you, Bella.

147
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,667
Kill dead?

148
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,958
Snakes, carriages,
sharp-faced birds, earthquakes

149
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,583
inhalation of toxic grass seeds.

150
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,417
Bella.

151
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,958
Bella.

152
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,250
Bella. Look.

153
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,416
- Kill it.
- What?

154
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,667
Why you funny thumbs, God?

155
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,583
Once when I was very small

156
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,625
my father pinned my thumbs
into a small iron case

157
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,917
to see whether he could retard
the growth cycle of bones.

158
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,708
Now, the pain was so great

159
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,000
to stop myself from weeping...

160
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,208
I would stare deeply
into my other fingers,

161
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,042
and simply by observation

162
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,333
begin to parse out the
epidemiological elements.

163
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,750
When he came back

164
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:14,042
to his surprise, I was smiling.

165
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:16,917
Good God.

166
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,292
He was a man of
unconventional mind.

167
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,583
Time to go.

168
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,625
A storm approaches.

169
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,833
Why must you scare her so?

170
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,208
She's an experiment,

171
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
and I must control
the conditions,

172
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,500
or our results will not be pure.

173
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,125
Stop! God, we go!

174
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,292
No, Bella.

175
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,000
Bella want walk in ice cream.

176
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,000
No.

177
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,375
Bella wants!

178
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,875
My face. People scared of God.

179
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,042
Laugh at God.

180
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,375
God lovely.

181
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,875
Like dog face.

182
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Quite.

183
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,708
- Stop! Me walk.
- No!

184
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,000
No now? No never?

185
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,875
Just no.

186
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,792
- Bella!
- No!

187
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,583
- No! No! No!
- Bella!

188
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,375
No!

189
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,833
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No!

190
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,417
No! No!

191
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,083
I'm sorry, my darling.

192
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,833
Mother of God.

193
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,500
What did you do to her?

194
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,417
Why are you hiding her?

195
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,083
Tell me what all this means,
or I'll go to the police.

196
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,167
I shall. For it is a happy tale.

197
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:11,875
<i>It is rare to get a body, albeit
dead, but so close to life.</i>

198
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,542
Rigor had not set in.

199
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,208
The body had hardly cooled.

200
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,250
<i>No pulse.</i>

201
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,875
But some electric currents, so
I could have kept her alive.

202
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,292
But you didn't.

203
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,167
<i>I knew nothing of the
life she had abandoned</i>

204
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:32,125
<i>except she hated it so much
that she had chosen not to be,</i>

205
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,375
and forever.

206
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,250
What would she feel

207
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:40,500
<i>on being dragged from her
carefully chosen blank eternity,</i>

208
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,500
and forced to be put in
one of our understaffed

209
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:47,458
poorly-equipped madhouses,
reformatories or jails?

210
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:53,417
<i>For in this Christian nation, suicide
is treated as lunacy or crime.</i>

211
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,958
<i>Who was I to decide her fate?</i>

212
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,167
But then there was also,
on my part, a recognition.

213
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,292
All my research had
come to this moment.

214
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,042
Fate had brought me a dead body,

215
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,208
<i>and a live infant.</i>

216
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,625
It was obvious.

217
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:09,792
It was?

218
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,375
Take the infant's brain out,

219
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:14,792
and put it in the full-grown
woman, reanimate her, and watch.

220
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,667
Jesus!

221
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:10,542
She knows?

222
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,958
No.

223
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,125
Who was she?

224
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:14,625
No idea.

225
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:18,958
But would you rather the
world did not have Bella?

226
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,708
Mrs. Prim?

227
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,583
Bella discover
happy when she want.

228
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,792
You are a sour
face, but I fix you.

229
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,417
Close eyes.

230
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,917
- No!
- Just wait. It takes a moment.

231
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,417
She grabbed my hairy business.

232
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:19,875
She's sick!

233
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:20,875
Bella.

234
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,083
Bella have discover
something I must share.

235
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,250
Watch.

236
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,083
- What if put cucumber in me?
- No.

237
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,375
Bella! Bella!

238
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,500
Cease working
yourself immediately.

239
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,500
What?

240
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,542
In polite society,
that is not done.

241
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,000
Just do not.

242
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,625
What... is that?

243
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,500
My father took out my
oxyntic and pyloric glands,

244
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,208
so I must make my
own gastric juices.

245
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:04,192
Why in God's name
would he do that?

246
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,708
To discover what no one knew.

247
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,500
Turns out we need them. Ideally.

248
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,292
Bella

249
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,750
you have not eaten.

250
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,708
Do not.

251
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,250
Good night.

252
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,708
'Night.

253
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,125
You know, I'm actually
something of a romantic, Max.

254
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:53,708
What?

255
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,500
I believe I see love
between you and Bella.

256
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,458
I... She is...

257
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,083
Perhaps you should marry her.

258
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,250
What?

259
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,750
I think she loves you.

260
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,375
<i>I've seen people look
at each other with love</i>

261
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,583
<i>as an observer.</i>

262
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,875
<i>Not the subject, of
course. I see it.</i>

263
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,333
<i>You do?</i>

264
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,042
<i>I...</i>

265
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:22,208
I do have feelings for her.

266
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,917
So, you would?

267
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,667
Take Bella out.

268
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:28,958
Bella...

269
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:31,958
I...

270
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,708
Feel funny?

271
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,333
Do Bella.

272
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,333
<i>I was wondering</i>

273
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,917
if perhaps you were raising
her to be your mistress.

274
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,417
A dark thought
unworthy of me, I know.

275
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,833
So, you are not laying with her?

276
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:06,208
Spermatic ejaculation can
only induce homeostasis in me

277
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:10,375
if accompanied by prolonged
stimulation of higher nerve centers

278
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,458
whose pressure on the ductless glands
changes the chemistry of my blood

279
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,750
not for a few spasmodic minutes,

280
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,250
but for many days.

281
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,750
What?

282
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:23,042
I am a eunuch and
can't fuck her.

283
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,250
To get a sexual
response from my body

284
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:30,083
would take the same amount of
electricity as runs North London.

285
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:33,500
Besides, my paternal feelings

286
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,042
seem to outweigh
my sexual thoughts.

287
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,375
<i>I apologize for my
own dark thoughts.</i>

288
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,583
<i>Not dark at all.</i>

289
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,917
<i>Men's, indeed all sexuality,
is basically immoral.</i>

290
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,875
<i>Not all, sir.</i>

291
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,833
<i>Do you wish to marry her or not?</i>

292
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,083
I wish to marry you. Be my wife.

293
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,458
Let us touch each
other's genital pieces.

294
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,042
No. No.

295
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,292
I do not wish to take
advantage of you.

296
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,583
You are special.

297
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,417
When we are wed.

298
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,375
One condition.

299
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,167
She must desire it
also, I understand.

300
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,875
Two conditions, then.

301
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,250
That one you said,

302
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:29,250
and you must live
here with me, always.

303
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:33,250
<i>I will have a legal
agreement drawn up.</i>

304
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,667
Curious contract.

305
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,750
There are several
spelling errors.

306
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:07,083
Immaterial to the legal
bindingness of it, I assure you.

307
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:13,000
Must be quite a woman
to warrant such binding.

308
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,000
If you'll excuse me, I
need to use the facilities.

309
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,458
Are you five years old that
you can't hold your water?

310
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:29,125
Weak bladder, sir. Like my father
before me and his before him.

311
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,708
You may have prostate
cancer. Look into it.

312
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Will do.

313
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,500
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per
your contract, no doubt.

314
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,250
Good afternoon, visiting man.

315
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,292
Want my hat?

316
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,417
Would it suit me?

317
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,083
Yes.

318
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,083
It is foolish good.

319
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,375
I had to meet this woman

320
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:59,167
who would inspire such a contract
of marriage that imprisons her.

321
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,250
What you mean?

322
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,417
You shall live here

323
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,833
travel with Mr. Max
McCandles and Baxter abroad,

324
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,875
but not go forth in the city.

325
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,708
I see.

326
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,083
They love me tight.

327
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,750
I understand why.

328
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,968
I have to pinch you,
to see if you are real.

329
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,125
You will not...

330
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,000
Who is you?

331
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,750
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

332
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,625
Open.

333
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,292
How you get up here?

334
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,583
I climbed.

335
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,792
You were watch me long?

336
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,250
Not long.

337
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:38,833
You did not see me working on
myself to get happiness, did you?

338
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,958
It is not polites, I know.

339
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,333
Do not care for polite society.

340
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,625
It's fucking boring.

341
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,750
Destroys one's soul.

342
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,375
God not believe in soul.

343
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:00,042
I think God's the actual
author of the soul idea.

344
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,083
Godwin Baxter?

345
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,042
That burnt dog.

346
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,750
What is that story?

347
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,167
You are a prisoner
and I aim to free you.

348
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,125
Something in you,
some hungry being

349
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:17,000
hungry for experience,
freedom, touch.

350
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,250
To see the unknown and know it.

351
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,375
So, why am I here, you ask?

352
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,583
I'm going to Lisbon on
Friday. I'd like you to come.

353
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,375
Lisbon of Portugal?

354
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,583
That is the Lisbon I speak of.

355
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,500
God never allow it.

356
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,708
That's why I'm not asking him.

357
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,583
I'm asking you.

358
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,958
Bella not safe
with you, I think.

359
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:48,292
You are absolutely... not.

360
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,708
May I have a moment of
value time, dear God?

361
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,167
Of course, Bella.

362
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,917
I wanted to tell you big news.

363
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,167
Bella is dizzy with excite.

364
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,583
What is it?

365
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,417
Tonight, at midnight...

366
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,708
I secretly run away with
one Duncan Wedderburn.

367
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,917
What?

368
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,375
You will wish to stop me.

369
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,542
I shall stop you.

370
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,458
You hold Bella too tight.

371
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,875
I must set forth into waters.

372
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,042
We can travel.

373
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,000
You, me, and Max whom,
I will remind you

374
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,458
you are betrothed to.

375
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,292
I will marry Max

376
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,958
as he seems right for that,

377
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,792
but first, I shall adventure
on Duncan Wedderburn

378
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,583
who, I think, cares
little of damage to me,

379
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,333
but will be interesting as well.

380
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,000
I can't let you go.

381
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,792
Kiss me and set me forth.

382
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,750
If you do not...

383
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,167
Bella's insides shall
turn rotten with hate.

384
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,542
- Hate?
- Hate.

385
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,917
Unpack those bags, Prim.

386
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,958
Godwin has told me your plan.

387
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,250
I do not blame you, Bella.

388
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,167
That man is a cad and a rake.

389
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,125
He has insidious ways of getting
under a naive woman's skin.

390
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:30,708
It is mostly his eyes on mine.

391
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,625
And his hands when
between Bella's legs,

392
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,208
and whisper words I can't hear,

393
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,292
but heat in my body.

394
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,833
Jesus, Bella.

395
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,375
We are engaged.

396
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:42,292
I love you.

397
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,500
And when I return, we marriage,

398
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,792
and be happy as two
doves on a branch.

399
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,708
- You think I need travel hat?
- No!

400
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,375
This will not do.

401
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,208
It cannot!

402
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,667
I'll see to this man myself.

403
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:58,208
I will beat his handsome face into
a porridge of blood and bones!

404
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,083
Max, you are flushed,

405
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,542
and I am too at sight
of different Max.

406
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,458
I apologize,

407
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,000
but I will not let a man that I know
has nothing but ill intent in his mind,

408
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,708
and nothing for you in
his heart trick you.

409
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,667
I will smash his
fucking head in.

410
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,292
Bella? It...

411
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,750
Bella.

412
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,333
Goodbye, later dove.

413
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,083
I will see you after
grand adventure.

414
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,208
God?

415
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:32,875
She's gone.

416
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,333
I am having port for breakfast.

417
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,458
It is strangely delicious.

418
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,292
Why did you not stop her?

419
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,458
She is a being of free will.

420
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,875
She's now out there. Alone.

421
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,917
She will be fine.

422
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,042
I'm a fool. I should
have stopped her.

423
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,167
We are men of science.

424
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,792
This emotionality is unseemly.

425
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,917
I just hope she's all right.

426
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,583
You are the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

427
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,167
I will not lie, I
have been with many.

428
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:37,000
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf with
scent of hundred women on you.

429
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,542
She undersells it.

430
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:41,667
Okay. Oysters.

431
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,417
Have you had them before?

432
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,750
I have not.

433
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,042
Shuck, chuck and bubble.

434
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,042
Rollicking.

435
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:07,708
Rollicking.

436
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,625
Wait. Bella.

437
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,958
So, nuns and monks would starch
their clothes with egg whites,

438
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,292
and, with the yolks,
make these tarts.

439
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:29,000
Now, how to eat them?

440
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,792
I will guess through the mouth.

441
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,875
They must not be eaten
dainty flake by dainty flake,

442
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,917
but inhaled with gusto,
like life itself.

443
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:44,667
Incredible.

444
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,667
Who made these? We need more.

445
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,375
No more. One's enough.
Any more is too much.

446
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,708
It's siesta time.

447
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,458
What is siesta?

448
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,792
Why do people not just do this

449
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,250
all the time?

450
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,083
Well, at the risk
of being immodest

451
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,083
you've just been thrice
fucked by the very best.

452
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,050
It's probable no other man would ever
bring you to the raptures I have.

453
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:37,958
I feel bad for you.

454
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:43,042
Well, then it will just be
you I do furious jumping with.

455
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:45,417
Furious jumping?

456
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,167
I love that.

457
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm rested.

458
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:50,833
Let us go again.

459
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,125
Again?

460
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,375
Unfortunately

461
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,083
even I have my limits.

462
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,542
Men cannot keep
coming back for more.

463
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,917
It is a physiological problem?

464
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,125
A weakness in men?

465
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Well...

466
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,292
Perhaps so.

467
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,792
You'd be advised,
if it's not too late

468
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,708
not to fall in love with me.

469
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,833
I have very little to offer

470
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,708
in the way of constancy.

471
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:20,042
Just adventure.

472
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,375
I see.

473
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,042
Let us sleep.

474
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:53,792
Taxi, madam?

475
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,458
Good evening...

476
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,333
Duncan Wedderburn.

477
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,750
Bella, where were
you? You disappeared.

478
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:42,667
I did not.

479
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:45,375
Nobody can just disappear.

480
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:46,875
What?

481
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,625
Can they? Disappear?

482
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,792
No, of course not. What
the fuck are you talking...

483
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:52,958
Where were you?

484
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:56,708
I wanted a tart and then
an adventure befell me.

485
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,792
I did not know how to
return and then I heard it.

486
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:00,792
The tram.

487
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:03,708
I will walk to the
noise, and I found it.

488
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,375
Amazement to Bella.

489
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,000
Explorer bloods in me.

490
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,184
Bella, it's dangerous
to go out without me.

491
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,458
I have adventured it and found
nothing but sugar and violence.

492
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,125
It is most charming.

493
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,375
I am fine.

494
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:20,042
Now, I must lie down and you must lie down
on top of me and do more furious jumping.

495
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,167
Kitty.

496
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,542
Did you see the new
show in London by Wilde?

497
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,917
Marvelously witty.

498
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,208
I loved it.

499
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,958
"A handbag."

500
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:38,667
Bella.

501
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
What?

502
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:45,125
Why I keep it in my
mouth if it is revolting?

503
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,875
I have said that
before to Gerald.

504
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,667
If you catch my drift.

505
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,250
You are wicked.

506
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,458
Oh. Because you mean his penis.

507
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,708
Duncan's can sometimes be salty.

508
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,708
Good God, Bella.

509
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,250
I must go punch that baby.

510
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,958
Bella.

511
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,000
Your behavior is unconscionable.

512
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,292
Will you behave?

513
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,625
The food was cacking my throat

514
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,292
the baby annoying,

515
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,708
and the woman boring with words.

516
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,042
You will rejoin the table,

517
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:34,000
and will confine yourself to
the following three phrases...

518
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,333
"How marvelous!", "Delighted",

519
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,125
and "How did they make
the pastry so crisp?" Yes?

520
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:42,250
You are hurting Bella.

521
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,667
Sorry.

522
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,792
Reason does not penetrate.

523
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:46,958
Let us go.

524
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,833
Are you enjoying Lisbon, Bella?

525
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:09,958
Delighted.

526
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:14,500
Kitty, how is your dear father?

527
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,083
He's very unwell.

528
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,500
I fear he will not
see the year out.

529
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,958
How marvelous.

530
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:22,542
How did they get
the pastry so crisp?

531
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,750
Good God.

532
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:44,667
What is it?

533
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:46,875
From her.

534
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,625
"Me good. Lisbon."

535
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:56,083
"Sugar tart lick me all day."

536
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,583
At least I hope that's
all one sentence, anyway.

537
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:00,792
- Do you think they're...
- Fucking?

538
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:01,958
Yes.

539
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,417
Also

540
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,292
{\an8}fellating a tram.

541
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:22,292
Does your head ache
too, Duncan Wedderburn?

542
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,917
And I also am
starving for dinner.

543
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,667
Where the fuck were you?

544
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,792
Victoria Blessington?

545
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:35,167
I haven't seen you for years.

546
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,125
And you still have not

547
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,625
as I am Bella Baxter

548
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,500
strange feathered lady.

549
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,417
I apologize. I could've
sworn you were she.

550
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:50,417
Right.

551
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:51,792
Shall we?

552
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,208
The steak, the fish

553
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,500
little caramel things in pots

554
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,083
that old spotted
people over there have.

555
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,917
I don't want caramel in pots.

556
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,500
Of course not. That
was all for Bella.

557
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,125
Order at your whim.

558
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,625
You are cross at Bella's
outings and adventures.

559
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,958
And yet we must discover by whim

560
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,000
as spoken by Duncan
Wedderburn to Bella Baxter

561
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,708
day one of Lisbon love affair.

562
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:19,292
Touché.

563
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,750
Understand me never lived
outside God's house.

564
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:22,625
What?

565
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,167
So, Bella so much to discover,

566
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,500
and your sad face

567
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:31,000
makes me discover
angry feelings for you.

568
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,708
Right.

569
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,226
I have become the
very thing I hate

570
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,625
a grasping succubus of a lover.

571
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:43,542
I've pried many of them
off me and now I'm it.

572
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,083
Fuck!

573
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,458
You, like me, are a creature
of freedom in the moments.

574
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,738
What do you keep doing that for?

575
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,958
A man over there
repeated blinks at me.

576
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,292
I blink back.

577
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,833
For polites, I think.

578
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,708
We are going to dance
in town. Please join us.

579
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,958
I have never danced in town.

580
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,250
- Duncan!
- Can't!

581
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:53,250
You're quite mad.

582
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,333
Stop talking as your
sounds make Bella angry!

583
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,750
I will not stop talking.

584
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,059
If I have something
to say I'll...

585
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,083
Ouch.

586
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
All right.

587
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:13,875
What's this?

588
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,292
A man was teaching me chess,

589
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:24,083
and he said he thought I would probably
have the softest skin he had ever touched.

590
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,667
And I said, if I did it would
be the inner thighs to test

591
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:32,000
as that is where the
epidermis is at its most fine.

592
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,250
So we tested,

593
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,500
and it was the softest ever.

594
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:39,583
I wondered if perhaps they're
not equal in softitude.

595
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,208
Indeed they were not.

596
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,417
So I made sure to note it,
remembering which was which.

597
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,000
What of the tongue play
you were about to perform?

598
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,542
Is that not happening?

599
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:18,750
You...

600
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,542
You are troubled.

601
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,292
Did he lie with you?

602
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,792
No, we were against a wall.

603
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,417
Did you furious jump him?

604
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,750
No, he just fast-licked
my clitoris.

605
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:37,667
I had the heat that needed
release, so at my request it was.

606
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,167
You, too, may tongue play me,

607
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:48,167
so I'm not understanding
this complicated feeling.

608
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:52,958
Are you now crying?

609
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:05,417
What a confusing person
you are, Duncan Wedderburn.

610
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,875
A liver.

611
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:19,125
A small incision

612
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,875
is all that is needed.

613
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,750
I was chloroforming
goats all morning.

614
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,333
I may have ingested too much.

615
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,375
I am going to venture to suggest
you are upset by Bella's absence.

616
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,167
The liters of port

617
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,917
the sobbing I hear at night.

618
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,958
Good God, man! You
prattle like an imbecile.

619
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:54,417
She is gone!

620
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,667
I am a man of science.

621
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,917
I just need to engage in,
and continue, the project.

622
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,083
That is all. I must go
on to the next thing.

623
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,625
Our feelings must be put aside.

624
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,333
Do you think my father
could have branded me

625
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,208
with hot irons on the
genitals the way he did

626
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:16,458
if he could not put
science and progress first?

627
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:17,625
Branded you?

628
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,083
Let us find a body.

629
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:24,667
A what?

630
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,000
Hello. Good morning.

631
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,125
Good morning, darling.

632
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:00,750
I haven't been very supportive
of your adventurous spirit.

633
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:02,542
So I have a surprise for you.

634
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,083
Get in.

635
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,375
- We changed hotels?
- Look out the window, Bella.

636
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,000
- We're on boat?
- Indeed.

637
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:48,417
- You aim to trap Bella at sea.
- I aim to give you a new adventure.

638
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,125
I suppose it's true
you'll be easier to find.

639
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,833
Come, disrobe me.

640
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Ride me.

641
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,333
And we'll then have
cocktails on foredeck.

642
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:18,292
Bella.

643
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,500
Bella.

644
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:29,042
Bella.

645
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:31,042
Bella!

646
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,375
Blue. Blue. Blue.

647
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,708
Shit on me?

648
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:16,292
Fucker!

649
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:21,833
Madam.

650
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:25,042
When do we stop?

651
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,417
Athens. Three days.

652
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,917
That woman's on fire, look.

653
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,167
I know you're upset with me.

654
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,125
Forgive my kidnapping of
you, but it was for love.

655
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,542
A romantic jape. Don't
be such a cunt about it.

656
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:12,000
- I want a drink.
- Of course, my darling.

657
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:15,375
The ship is fun, a
whole world to explore.

658
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:18,083
Do you love me? I love you.

659
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:23,375
Describe the elements I should be
looking for within myself to be sure.

660
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:25,917
You just feel it or not.

661
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:29,667
So it is no evidence
base, as God would say.

662
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:33,137
- So how judge it empirically?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

663
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,208
Who are you?

664
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,958
You don't know what bananas are,
you've never heard of chess,

665
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,805
and yet you know what
"empirically" means.

666
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,500
Bella wants a drink.
I said twice now.

667
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:44,125
I've never felt
anything like this.

668
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:45,708
Is this true for you?

669
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:49,458
I suppose, empirically it is.

670
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,958
I'm out of ink.

671
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,375
Then ink you shall
have, my love.

672
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:17,083
Hello, interesting older lady.

673
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,875
I must touch your hair.

674
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,000
I also noticed your hair.

675
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:27,167
Just like silk on a
translucent, glowing egg.

676
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:30,208
That is fancy words
that excite me somehow.

677
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:33,208
I saw you're with
handsome over there.

678
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,500
White teeth and a hard cock.

679
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:38,042
Duncan Wedderburn.

680
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:41,542
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.

681
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,667
- Good lay, I hope.
- He is my only.

682
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:48,167
But I find him to elicit exceptional
sensations throughout my whole body

683
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,500
that leave me yelping happily.

684
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:54,583
I also wish to dash his body,
form, cadaver, into the sea.

685
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,542
Is this man jumping
on your body?

686
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,458
No, he is not.

687
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,625
I haven't been
bedded in 20 years.

688
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:01,792
What?

689
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:03,583
That is terrible.

690
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,583
It doesn't concern me greatly.

691
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,750
As years have passed

692
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:10,542
what's in between my
ears is my big concern.

693
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,083
What's in between my legs

694
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:15,667
much less so.

695
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,083
A desperate
rationalization, Martha.

696
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,458
Oh, this is Harry Astley.

697
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:23,667
Don't take what he
says too much to heart.

698
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,250
He's a cynic.

699
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,917
Madam.

700
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,000
I am Bella Baxter.

701
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,292
I do not know what
this "cynic" is.

702
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:33,458
Bella.

703
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:34,875
Ink.

704
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:39,167
Duncan Wedderburn, I have made
friends, colleagues, comrades.

705
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:40,792
Harry Astley.

706
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,458
This is Martha.

707
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,750
She is my new friend who has
not been fucked in 20 years.

708
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,500
Is that not astonishment?

709
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:51,125
I hope you use your hand between
your legs to keep yourself happy.

710
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:54,750
Good God, Bella, you
cannot speak like this.

711
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:57,000
Polites of society. I forgot.

712
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,625
Polite society

713
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:00,208
will destroy you.

714
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,500
- It will?
- Yeah, there's some truth to that.

715
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:04,458
We all agreed on that.

716
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,958
As to your enquiry on my hand.

717
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,958
Occasionally, yes.

718
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,375
That is much reassuring news.

719
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:14,708
- We shall all dine together.
- Well, actually...

720
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,417
We are all on a ship
and cannot escape,

721
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:20,667
and there is a world to enjoy,
traverse, circumnavigate.

722
01:08:21,582 --> 01:08:23,707
Or can she not have
friends, Mr. Wedderburn?

723
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:25,957
Delighted.

724
01:08:29,082 --> 01:08:30,375
Marry me.

725
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:31,375
What?

726
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:32,875
I meant to throw you aside.

727
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,582
A few months and send you
packing, but I cannot.

728
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,417
Say you'll marry me. No one's
ever captured my heart. You have.

729
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:41,082
It is tricky

730
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,667
as I am engaged to
Mr. Max McCandles.

731
01:08:44,957 --> 01:08:45,957
What?

732
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,000
My hand has taken by another.

733
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:52,625
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.

734
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:55,957
You do not take just the
hand, but all, do you not?

735
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,707
You ran away with me from him.

736
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:02,125
A recounting of events, the
point of which is elusive to me.

737
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:03,582
You chose me over him.

738
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,250
For now.

739
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:06,457
For fun.

740
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:09,292
I'll fucking throw
you overboard!

741
01:09:09,457 --> 01:09:12,417
So you wish to
marry me or kill me?

742
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,250
- Is that the proposal?
- No.

743
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,707
Going to the casino.

744
01:09:44,082 --> 01:09:45,167
That's fine.

745
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:47,125
She is coming along.

746
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:48,875
Let's try again.

747
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:52,917
Gross motor skills
will develop slowly,

748
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,792
but you will progress fast.

749
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:58,833
Felicity.

750
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Not that fast.

751
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,708
I am reading Emerson.

752
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,292
He speaks about the
improvement of men.

753
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:23,542
I do not know why he does
not give advice to women.

754
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,292
Perhaps he does not know any.

755
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:29,042
Try and read Goethe.

756
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,750
Philosophy is a
waste of time, Bella.

757
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,125
Really? Say more.

758
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:36,208
No, no, Harry, you wretch.

759
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,375
It is integral.

760
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:41,458
People and society
can be improved.

761
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:46,292
It is the goal of all to
improve, advance, progress, grow.

762
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,833
I know this in me, and I am
sure I am indicative of all.

763
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,042
Trust me, you are definitely
unique, Bella, in all ways.

764
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,750
But this improvement
through philosophy

765
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:02,000
is people trying to run away from the
fact that we are all cruel beasts.

766
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,458
Born that way, die that way.

767
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,292
It is a dark view
of things, Harry.

768
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:08,458
Bella

769
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:11,375
let us take the air

770
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,542
in our cabin.

771
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,327
But these two are fighting,

772
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:19,208
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart

773
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,000
like lights in a storm.

774
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:26,083
You're always
reading now, Bella.

775
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:30,167
You're losing some of your
adorable way of speaking.

776
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,000
I am a changing able feast

777
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,417
as are all of we.

778
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,417
Apparently according to Emerson,
disagreed with by Harry.

779
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,875
Come, come. Just come.

780
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,167
You are in my sun.

781
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,792
What?

782
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:22,542
Come.

783
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,042
Busy drinking heavily.

784
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,875
Busy losing heavily.

785
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,708
I must go meet Martha.

786
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,708
Martha.

787
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:18,208
She is the problem.

788
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,458
I'll throw that perfumed
bag of flesh overboard.

789
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:24,667
I dare you.

790
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,542
Martha!

791
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,000
Where is she?

792
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:40,750
Where are you, fuck.

793
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,292
Where is she?

794
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:46,125
- Where are you going?
- She's going over the side.

795
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:47,417
Oh, marvelous!

796
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,667
I never imagined being murdered.

797
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:50,833
How dramatic.

798
01:13:51,417 --> 01:13:54,250
Well, she seems happy to die. I'm
sorry for getting in your way.

799
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,458
Exciting.

800
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,792
I'll be in the bar.

801
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:57,208
You have made me think, cogitate

802
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,917
perambulate on
ideas that are wrong

803
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:04,250
erroneous and
nonsensically annoying

804
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,125
that lead me not to sleep.

805
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,417
So...

806
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:11,417
You say all are cruel.

807
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,167
And I disagree, disavow,

808
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,375
and say no not.

809
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,625
But when with Duncan

810
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:21,333
the cruel just bubbles up in me.

811
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,250
That shows good judgment.

812
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,750
He is a pretty moron.

813
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:26,917
No.

814
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:29,167
I do not wish to be cruel.

815
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:33,000
I must improve this
aspect of myself.

816
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,708
You don't know the world.

817
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,375
And you fear it.

818
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:40,375
I do not fear it.

819
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:42,958
Do you want to see what
the world is really like?

820
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,583
I'll show you.

821
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:46,167
Yes.

822
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,792
Of course.

823
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:35,667
Do you hear that?

824
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:40,292
What is it?

825
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,208
Lot of dead babies.

826
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:05,417
Must be hot.

827
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:08,583
We must go help them.

828
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,000
How will we do that?

829
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,167
We go down there

830
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,833
they'll quite rightfully
rope us, rob us, and rape us.

831
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,167
And if they were here
and we were there

832
01:17:21,792 --> 01:17:23,167
we'd do the same to them.

833
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:28,708
Bella.

834
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:30,583
Bella.

835
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
Bella.

836
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,292
We are casting off, ma'am.

837
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:18,292
But I have to go back.

838
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:23,167
I must give this money to
the poor near the hotel

839
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,875
in what they call a slum.

840
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,542
We're staying ashore, ma'am.

841
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,958
We could take care
of that for you.

842
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:31,667
You can?

843
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:32,708
Of course.

844
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,667
It is generous of you.

845
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,333
They need money.

846
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,042
Everyone does.

847
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,750
Thank you.

848
01:20:01,917 --> 01:20:05,333
You! Get me the captain. Now
we'll find this fucking thief.

849
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,500
Bella!

850
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:09,208
We've been robbed!

851
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,333
I won.

852
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,958
I won everything

853
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,583
like never before.

854
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,917
And now it's gone.

855
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,792
You've not been robbed.

856
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,792
- I took it.
- For what?

857
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:22,417
I took it.

858
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:25,625
I'm so tired.

859
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:29,958
Or maybe just my spirit is.

860
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:33,458
My soul has been
buckled, crumpled

861
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,458
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn

862
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,833
by the sights I have seen.

863
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,458
- So, no need for the captain then, sir?
- Fuck off before I break all your teeth.

864
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:48,083
Indeed, sir.

865
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:52,792
Where is it?

866
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:55,083
You hid it for safety.

867
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,625
I was drunk and foolishly left
it everywhere. What a relief.

868
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:01,042
I did not hide it.

869
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:05,208
I gave it to those
poor people out there.

870
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,917
Money is its own
form of sickness,

871
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,125
and all the scarcity of it.

872
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:14,042
And who am I

873
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,708
lying in a feather bed

874
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:19,458
while dead babies

875
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,417
lie in a ditch?

876
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:24,417
Duncan.

877
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:28,000
You what?

878
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:32,667
I am expecting a hug of solace.

879
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,542
You...

880
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:37,167
I need to offer
something to the world.

881
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,625
And yet I have nothing.

882
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:42,125
Except some money.

883
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,875
It is a bad day
for Bella Baxter.

884
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:51,250
Where is my fucking money?

885
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:52,542
I just told you.

886
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,458
I gave it away to the poor.

887
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:59,167
I thought I told
you to fuck off!

888
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,750
The steward informs me

889
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,792
that you may not have sufficient
funds to make good your account, sir.

890
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:07,208
- Well, I...
- That is probably true.

891
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:10,042
I gave it all to some nice men

892
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,417
to pass on

893
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:14,375
to the slum poor.

894
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,167
You'll be put ashore
at the next port,

895
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:19,458
and confined to crew's
rations until then, sir.

896
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,500
- Good evening.
- How dare you?

897
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:36,125
"Dead, blind babies"

898
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,917
"bit Harry."

899
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,417
"My mouth"

900
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:46,000
"was full of blood."

901
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,458
Poor Bella.

902
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:51,500
She is a ruin.

903
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,500
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.

904
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,083
I'm sorry.

905
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,958
You were trying to
help me understand.

906
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,667
No. I actually
wanted to hurt you.

907
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:09,917
Couldn't bear to see such dumb,
beautiful happiness in someone.

908
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:11,667
It was cruel of me.

909
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:13,500
I am not sorry.

910
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,208
If I know the world,
I can improve it.

911
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:17,500
You can't.

912
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,417
That is the real point.

913
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,750
Don't accept the lie of religion

914
01:23:21,917 --> 01:23:22,917
socialism

915
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:24,375
capitalism.

916
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,417
We are a fucked species.

917
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:28,875
Know it. Hope is smash able.

918
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,250
Realism is not.

919
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,458
Protect yourself with the truth.

920
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,375
I realize what you
are now, Harry.

921
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:39,625
Just a broken little boy who
cannot bear the pain of the world.

922
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:42,667
I suppose so.

923
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,042
Goodbye, Harry.

924
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,917
We get thrown off in Marseille.

925
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,250
Why do you stay with him?

926
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,333
I always think it
will be better.

927
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,375
'Course you do.

928
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,500
I have heard great things
of the beauty of Paris.

929
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,417
I'll fucking kick
your dog to death.

930
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:31,833
Fucking...

931
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:34,000
Paris with no money.

932
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:37,375
- What do you suggest we do, Bella?
- I will get us a hotel.

933
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,583
Do not worry.

934
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,792
With what? We have no money.

935
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:45,250
Is it not an
interesting experiment?

936
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:46,417
We have nothing.

937
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,833
- How will we live now?
- I don't know!

938
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,917
Exactly, that is the experiment.

939
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:52,542
We are now the poor.

940
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,125
Also, many adventurers
have faced these odds.

941
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:58,083
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

942
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:01,208
Selfish, thoughtless,
careless bitch.

943
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,625
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.

944
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,667
And while it is true my ability

945
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,917
to think things through to
the logical conclusions is not

946
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:10,708
strong...

947
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,167
I did help those
suffering people.

948
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,583
I have ruined us

949
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,250
as you pointed out,

950
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:19,083
but I do believe my actions
come from a good place.

951
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,333
Shut the fuck up.

952
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:23,583
I will get us a hotel.

953
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:30,333
Good afternoon, madam.

954
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,667
Good day, my fresh,
darling English Rose.

955
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:35,667
Is this a hotel?

956
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:36,958
We have rooms.

957
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,667
Are you looking for work?

958
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,875
How much is a room?

959
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:42,125
I'll charge you
10 francs an hour.

960
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:44,333
You charge them 30.

961
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,625
Everyone's happy.

962
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,250
I see.

963
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,167
<i>Monsieur</i> Chapelle.

964
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,333
Fresh from London.

965
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,333
Hello.

966
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,292
So, off you go.

967
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,292
At this point, I am confused.

968
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:04,083
You're not here to work?

969
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,458
Come on.

970
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:08,083
Lie with him, let
him cock you a bit,

971
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,625
and make some nice francs.

972
01:26:09,792 --> 01:26:10,792
I see.

973
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,917
He would pay me for this?

974
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:14,417
Yes.

975
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,417
If you need money

976
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,667
it is the shortest route to it.

977
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:22,542
I have never been
cocked by another man,

978
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:24,667
and yet have wondered on that.

979
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:27,000
And am in need of funds.

980
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,875
It is, I believe, a
confluence of circumstances...

981
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:34,042
I regard as almost fate-like.

982
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,833
Let us do this.

983
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,750
Room 16.

984
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:18,583
What is your name?

985
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:27,792
Mysterious.

986
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:57,167
Should we warm me up a bit...

987
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,250
Good day, sir.

988
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:33,000
<i>Éclair au chocolat?</i>

989
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,917
I've come into some money
and some enlightenment.

990
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:38,833
You stole it?

991
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,042
You've always said you're the
best bed man in the world,

992
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:46,042
and I have never known another, so
I knew not whether this was true.

993
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:47,792
But now I do.

994
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:49,667
And he was terrible,

995
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:53,250
and made ungodly noises as
he thrust himself into me.

996
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:56,958
And a mere three thrusts, Duncan
Wedderburn, was all he could manage.

997
01:28:57,167 --> 01:28:58,583
I stifled a laugh

998
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,583
out of polites, of course.

999
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,792
I took his money. I thanked him.

1000
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:05,375
I laughed all the way
to buy us these eclairs,

1001
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:06,667
and I thought so fondly

1002
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,167
remembering the fierce
sweaty nights of ours.

1003
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,375
You fucked for money?

1004
01:29:13,542 --> 01:29:15,083
And as an experiment.

1005
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:20,000
And it is good for our relationship
as it gladdens my heart toward you.

1006
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:23,875
My heart has been a bit dim on
your weepy, sweary person lately.

1007
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:28,250
You are a monster. A
whore and a monster.

1008
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:29,875
A demon sent from hell

1009
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,625
to rip my spirit to shreds.

1010
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:34,542
To punish my tiny sins

1011
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:36,375
with a tsunami of destruction.

1012
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:38,333
To take my heart and
pull it like taffy

1013
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,333
to ruin me.

1014
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,417
I look at you, and I see
nothing but ugliness.

1015
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,875
That last bit was uncalled
for and makes no sense

1016
01:29:46,042 --> 01:29:48,667
as your odes to my
beauty have been boring,

1017
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:49,875
but constant.

1018
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,708
And the simple act

1019
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,333
of letting a strange
man ride on me

1020
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,542
has erased all that?

1021
01:29:58,875 --> 01:29:59,875
Fuck!

1022
01:30:00,042 --> 01:30:02,125
You who red yourself.

1023
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,875
Which you are now going
to explain to me is bad.

1024
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,458
Can I never win with you?

1025
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:09,333
It is the worst
thing women can do.

1026
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,542
We should definitely
never marry.

1027
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:15,667
I am a flawed,
experimenting person,

1028
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,625
and I will need a husband with
a more forgiving disposition.

1029
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,583
Cunt!

1030
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,333
I can now see you are not that.

1031
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,583
Our adventure is clearly over.

1032
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,208
I shall book you a
passage back to London.

1033
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:29,083
You had money

1034
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:30,833
this whole time?

1035
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,250
It is God's money.

1036
01:30:33,292 --> 01:30:34,333
For emergencies.

1037
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,833
It has been a fucking
emergency for weeks now!

1038
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,792
I believed in you the whole time

1039
01:30:39,292 --> 01:30:40,917
that you would rise
to the occasion.

1040
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:44,667
But now I see that was a mistake, and
there's clearly something broken in you.

1041
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,042
You broke that something in me!

1042
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,417
I feel this conversation
has become circular.

1043
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:52,000
Cunt!

1044
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:00,542
Madam Swiney, I have
examined my situation.

1045
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,292
I need sex and money.

1046
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:04,000
I could take a lover

1047
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,917
another Wedderburn
who would keep me,

1048
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:08,167
but may require an
awful lot of attention.

1049
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:10,042
Or else it's 20
minutes at a time,

1050
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,368
and the rest of my day is
free to study on the world,

1051
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,667
and the improvement of it.

1052
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,542
Hence, I seek employment

1053
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:19,625
at your musty-smelling establishment
of good-time fornication.

1054
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,750
A woman plotting her
course to freedom.

1055
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,958
How delightful.

1056
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,750
Come.

1057
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:32,500
<i>Monsieur</i> Saveur.

1058
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,292
A fillet mignon.

1059
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,833
A prime cut.

1060
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,125
Bella.

1061
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:55,500
Say <i>"formidable"</i> at the end.

1062
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:56,667
House rules.

1063
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,125
Is that smell you?

1064
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:03,042
<i>Formidable.</i>

1065
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:17,125
For the smell.

1066
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:20,083
And tea. Just
because tea is nice.

1067
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:25,375
It was brutal

1068
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,375
in a strangely not
unpleasant way.

1069
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:32,500
Pamphlet.

1070
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:34,958
- Read.
- What is that?

1071
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,792
<i>Une personne qui veut...</i> change
the world <i>pour le meilleur.</i>

1072
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:39,833
Make it better. A better world.

1073
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,625
Then I am that too.

1074
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:54,708
Madam Swiney

1075
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:56,667
this lineup system

1076
01:33:56,833 --> 01:34:00,458
you really expect me to go upstairs with
a man even if I find him distasteful,

1077
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,667
and therefore am sad

1078
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,292
when I let him furious jump me?

1079
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:06,875
That is the way
it is, my darling.

1080
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:11,417
Gosh, you look pretty.

1081
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,750
How it agrees with
you to be ravaged.

1082
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:15,667
I suppose so.

1083
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:22,917
So, would you not prefer
it if the women chose

1084
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:25,875
as it would be a sign of
enthusiasm toward you?

1085
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,476
You wouldn't have the vague sense
that they are in a state of horror

1086
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,542
when you jump them.

1087
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:37,375
Bella is new and may
have a mental illness.

1088
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:43,000
As God, my father, says

1089
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:46,042
it is only the way it is until
we discover the new way it is,

1090
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:48,928
and then that is the way it is
until we discover the new way it is,

1091
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,167
and so it goes until the
world is no longer flat

1092
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:54,417
electricity lights the night, and
shoes are no longer tied with ribbons.

1093
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,333
As a socialist,
I agree entirely.

1094
01:34:58,458 --> 01:35:00,958
Toinette, you have
such a clever mouth.

1095
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,375
<i>Monsieur</i> Mersault will
enjoy it for free.

1096
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:06,500
Go. Now.

1097
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:09,667
Bella, a moment in my office.

1098
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:14,458
You have the most
delicious looking lobes.

1099
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:16,542
Thank you.

1100
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:17,625
I must...

1101
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:23,375
Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.

1102
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:25,292
Here.

1103
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:32,125
I sometimes give in to myself
when I see beauty, young beauty.

1104
01:35:32,292 --> 01:35:33,792
For one day, my dear

1105
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:36,958
you will be a
wrinkled, old husk.

1106
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:41,542
And no one will want you either to
pay you for it or to have it for free.

1107
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:44,875
I still believe everyone would
be happier if we could choose.

1108
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:46,500
An idealist.

1109
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:47,833
Like me.

1110
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:50,750
How delightful you are.

1111
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:55,167
But we must give in to the
demands of the world sometimes.

1112
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,042
Grapple with it,
try to defeat it.

1113
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:59,500
- So you believe as me?
- Of course.

1114
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:03,792
But some men enjoy that
you do not like it.

1115
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:04,958
What?

1116
01:36:06,542 --> 01:36:07,625
- That is...
- Sick.

1117
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:09,583
But good business.

1118
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:11,458
Come with me.

1119
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:17,875
My grandchild.

1120
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:21,958
Sick and poorly, and
requiring much doctoring.

1121
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:26,792
My choice of giving you choice
will jeopardize the business.

1122
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:28,583
Her health. Her life.

1123
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,125
- Do you want that, Bella?
- Of course not.

1124
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:33,083
You don't? You're so lovely.

1125
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,917
I thought you were
going for my lobes.

1126
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:40,125
We must work.

1127
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,250
We must make money.

1128
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:46,750
But more than that, we
must experience everything

1129
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:48,125
not just the good.

1130
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:51,458
But degradation,
horror, sadness...

1131
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:54,083
This makes us whole, Bella.

1132
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,375
Makes us people of substance

1133
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:58,833
not flighty, untouched children.

1134
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,958
Then we can know the world.

1135
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:05,083
And when we know the world

1136
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,333
the world is ours.

1137
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:09,500
I want that.

1138
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:11,625
Now

1139
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:13,583
go and fuck someone,

1140
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,583
and bring me 10 francs.

1141
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:22,750
First, I suggest a short quiz.

1142
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:24,583
A quiz?

1143
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,042
You tell me a childhood memory.

1144
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:31,458
Then I tell a joke.

1145
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,375
Then a quick sniff,

1146
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:37,708
and if necessary, a quick
douse in lavender oil.

1147
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:42,458
And all of this will enhance the
experience making it <i>formidable.</i>

1148
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:47,500
<i>Non,</i> I tell the joke.

1149
01:37:47,667 --> 01:37:48,833
You the memory.

1150
01:37:59,042 --> 01:38:03,125
When you were little in Greece,
you fell from your bicycle?

1151
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,542
Blood. Down my leg.

1152
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,625
Joy?

1153
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:18,375
You watched the blood with joy.

1154
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:20,917
Knock, knock.

1155
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,583
Cheese to meet you.

1156
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:37,375
You know it.

1157
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,000
You smell okay.

1158
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,167
Let us fuck.

1159
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:32,042
God gave you a gift, my friend.

1160
01:40:12,792 --> 01:40:14,875
Very inelegant work.

1161
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:16,875
This is what you do
when you're homesick?

1162
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:33,042
You wish what?

1163
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:35,958
My boys are of an age
for education. Sexual.

1164
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:38,667
I will demonstrate.

1165
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,500
I see.

1166
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,250
At times.

1167
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:06,000
Shall I lay, bend, astride?

1168
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,792
Let's start simple, please.

1169
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,125
To aid things along

1170
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:46,042
- a finger in the arse.
- No.

1171
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:48,250
Or a slight choking may do it.

1172
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,417
Go home!

1173
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:26,208
Bella!

1174
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:29,458
Madam Swiney was right.

1175
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:32,375
I am discovering parts of
myself hitherto unknown.

1176
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:34,083
It is a way to look at it.

1177
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:38,083
The variety of desires being
made manifest is fascinating.

1178
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,083
Have you had the man

1179
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,890
who puts a wedge of pineapple in
your mouth and covers you in dust?

1180
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:44,542
Bella.

1181
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,375
I'm almost ready to forgive you.

1182
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:48,792
I've booked our berths home,

1183
01:42:48,958 --> 01:42:51,500
and I've told Mother to
prepare our wedding bed.

1184
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,375
Did you fuck that guy
with hooks for hands?

1185
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:56,042
You did. I know!

1186
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,208
I beat the tar out of that guy.

1187
01:42:59,375 --> 01:43:01,250
Duncan. I thought you left.

1188
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:03,792
Back to the ship, but
started to ache and vomit,

1189
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,250
so I'm here to save you.

1190
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:06,625
Hello, Duncan.

1191
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,125
Go home, Duncan.

1192
01:43:11,292 --> 01:43:12,750
Our time has ended.

1193
01:43:12,917 --> 01:43:13,976
I look at you and feel nothing,

1194
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,167
but the lingering question
of how did I ever want you?

1195
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:19,000
And we must go to the
meeting of socialists.

1196
01:43:21,792 --> 01:43:23,125
You're whores.

1197
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:25,583
We are our own
means of production.

1198
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,833
Go away.

1199
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,458
Foot.

1200
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:43,625
Paint, foot.

1201
01:43:43,792 --> 01:43:44,792
Very good.

1202
01:43:48,292 --> 01:43:50,667
Language is slow but improving.

1203
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:51,833
Paint. Foot.

1204
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Genius.

1205
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,750
Can you not be so cruel to her?

1206
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:57,458
I made a mistake with Bella.

1207
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:59,500
I allowed feelings to develop.

1208
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:03,917
There are none for her. She is
no different to the chicken dog.

1209
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:05,083
Foot.

1210
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:07,083
It is better this way, perhaps,

1211
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:10,250
and gives some insight into
my father's coolness to me.

1212
01:44:10,417 --> 01:44:13,042
It was a necessity of science.

1213
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:14,333
Good God, man.

1214
01:44:14,542 --> 01:44:17,083
- Foot.
- I do not expect you to understand

1215
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,500
village doctor.

1216
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,208
By the way, I need
you to operate on me.

1217
01:44:22,667 --> 01:44:24,917
Shall I put a beating heart
in your monstrous form?

1218
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,083
If you have time

1219
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:29,167
while taking

1220
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,333
this out.

1221
01:44:49,667 --> 01:44:52,375
I'll remove some cysts
from around the tumor.

1222
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,083
No need. You may close me up.

1223
01:44:55,917 --> 01:44:58,500
It has spread. I
see tiny polyps.

1224
01:45:01,667 --> 01:45:02,958
I am dying.

1225
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:05,458
How to break it to
the patient, eh?

1226
01:45:06,292 --> 01:45:07,292
Baxter...

1227
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:10,500
Do not cry into the wound! You'll
kill me faster with sepsis.

1228
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:12,042
Quiet now.

1229
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:13,625
And close me up.

1230
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:16,625
Find her.

1231
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:23,625
I am closed.

1232
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:32,667
Hot chocolate, my dear.

1233
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,917
And <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

1234
01:45:43,292 --> 01:45:44,375
You are my favorite.

1235
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:49,333
I have heard you say
that to the others.

1236
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,917
We are a machine you feed with
compliments and chocolate.

1237
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:55,250
You are my children
I feed with love.

1238
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:04,833
Something terrible
has happened, Swiney.

1239
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:07,417
I feel almost nothing.

1240
01:46:08,917 --> 01:46:12,125
My empathy is creeping
toward what I would describe

1241
01:46:12,292 --> 01:46:14,417
as contemptuous rage.

1242
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,333
This is fabulous.

1243
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,500
It is?

1244
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:22,458
You're in the dark period.

1245
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:26,250
Before light and
wisdom come to you.

1246
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,458
You must forge through it,

1247
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,833
and once on the other side

1248
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,458
you will be grateful to this
moment, but you must keep going.

1249
01:46:36,667 --> 01:46:37,708
I see.

1250
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:55,042
You've got a baby scar.

1251
01:47:58,042 --> 01:47:59,333
Mine is with <i>ma maman.</i>

1252
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:02,792
I don't have one.

1253
01:48:04,125 --> 01:48:06,292
It is an accident scar.

1254
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:08,875
But you're not the first
to have made the mistake.

1255
01:48:09,042 --> 01:48:10,125
Why lie?

1256
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:12,250
I'm not lying.

1257
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,750
My Godwin told me himself.

1258
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:33,792
Wedderburn.

1259
01:48:58,792 --> 01:48:59,917
Good day, sir.

1260
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,333
You wrote to Mr. Godwin Baxter.

1261
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,958
He has sent a demon at
large into the world.

1262
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:12,542
The devil's wrapped in an alluring
body that cannot be satiated,

1263
01:49:12,708 --> 01:49:15,708
and a mind that picks people
apart stitch by stitch

1264
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:19,417
like a bloodied and burned rag doll
shat out of an elephant's arse.

1265
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:20,583
Bella.

1266
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:22,167
Where is she?

1267
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:23,333
Who are you?

1268
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:25,125
I'm her fiancé, sir.

1269
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:32,000
Obviously, things did
not end well between you.

1270
01:49:32,167 --> 01:49:33,208
Did not?

1271
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,333
She destroyed me.

1272
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,417
Well, we're all masters
of our own ship, sir.

1273
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:39,333
There's that.

1274
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,708
I do not like you or your words.

1275
01:49:42,875 --> 01:49:44,125
That Godwin Baxter.

1276
01:49:44,292 --> 01:49:46,333
He knew, and he
set her on to me.

1277
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,500
He trapped me.

1278
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:50,125
Where is she?

1279
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:53,208
Would not wish her
on my worst enemy.

1280
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,667
I shall save you from her, sir.

1281
01:50:11,292 --> 01:50:13,625
Forgive my frustration.
Just tell me.

1282
01:50:13,792 --> 01:50:15,500
It does not hurt.

1283
01:50:15,667 --> 01:50:17,917
I have no insides.

1284
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:19,875
She hollowed me out.

1285
01:50:20,042 --> 01:50:22,250
My soul. My bank account!

1286
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:24,125
I am a bug! A shell!

1287
01:50:24,292 --> 01:50:25,292
Shall we sing?

1288
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:27,625
<i>Oh, we are sailors...</i>

1289
01:50:27,792 --> 01:50:28,792
It doesn't...

1290
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,250
Doesn't hurt.

1291
01:50:34,375 --> 01:50:36,208
I do not wish it
to be like this.

1292
01:50:37,583 --> 01:50:38,625
You force my hand.

1293
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:41,333
"We're all masters
of our own ship."

1294
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:44,292
You cunting
cunt-faced dead shit.

1295
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:45,750
Please.

1296
01:50:45,917 --> 01:50:47,583
I ask you as politely as I can.

1297
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,583
Where is she?

1298
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:47,625
The whore is back.

1299
01:51:52,792 --> 01:51:53,625
God?

1300
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:55,083
Bella!

1301
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,708
Max wrote me.

1302
01:51:56,875 --> 01:51:59,167
- You are ill?
- I am not. I am dying.

1303
01:51:59,333 --> 01:52:03,125
A subtle difference, but one I
take seriously as a physician.

1304
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:05,000
You are a sight and a good one.

1305
01:52:05,167 --> 01:52:06,000
You cannot die.

1306
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:08,375
Empirical data says different.

1307
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,750
I missed you.

1308
01:52:11,917 --> 01:52:14,833
I now have to lie down.

1309
01:52:21,042 --> 01:52:22,833
It is not all sunshine I bring.

1310
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:27,125
I also bring beady eyes
and hard questions.

1311
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:30,333
Did I have a baby in me?

1312
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,500
And if so, where is it?

1313
01:52:32,667 --> 01:52:33,750
I see.

1314
01:52:34,875 --> 01:52:38,583
Well, technically,
you are your baby.

1315
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:41,458
And also, I suppose
you are your mother.

1316
01:52:41,625 --> 01:52:43,458
And also neither.

1317
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:45,417
No memory survives.

1318
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:47,250
No experiences survive.

1319
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,333
What do you mean I am
mother and daughter?

1320
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:10,042
You knew and did not tell.

1321
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:13,250
I did not see good reason to.

1322
01:53:13,417 --> 01:53:14,542
And were too cowardly to.

1323
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:16,333
A bit of that as well.

1324
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,375
I wanted to be with you,

1325
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:22,167
and I was not sure you
would even understand.

1326
01:53:22,333 --> 01:53:25,750
And Baxter kind of makes
one a prisoner to him.

1327
01:53:25,917 --> 01:53:27,125
And I am...

1328
01:53:30,417 --> 01:53:31,417
I'm sorry.

1329
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,250
Bam.

1330
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:45,417
Bam.

1331
01:53:46,583 --> 01:53:47,583
Bam.

1332
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:49,708
Bam.

1333
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:51,958
Bam.

1334
01:53:52,917 --> 01:53:53,917
Bam.

1335
01:53:55,167 --> 01:53:56,167
Bam.

1336
01:53:56,333 --> 01:53:57,333
Who is this?

1337
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,500
<i>Bell whore.</i>

1338
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,828
<i>- Bell whore.
- I</i> see you've introduced me then, Prim.

1339
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:03,833
- I like this one though.
<i>- Bell whore.</i>

1340
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,917
- That's enough now, Felicity...
<i>- Bell whore.</i>

1341
01:54:06,667 --> 01:54:07,667
Fucker.

1342
01:54:09,083 --> 01:54:10,083
Another one?

1343
01:54:10,792 --> 01:54:11,833
We missed you.

1344
01:54:12,208 --> 01:54:13,542
Monsters.

1345
01:54:15,333 --> 01:54:16,833
Oh, fucking hell.

1346
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,958
<i>Bell whore.</i>

1347
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:20,750
<i>Bell whore.</i>

1348
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:01,375
<i>It is hard to be in the position
where one wants to hit someone</i>

1349
01:55:01,542 --> 01:55:03,417
<i>who is already in obvious pain.</i>

1350
01:55:03,583 --> 01:55:06,375
<i>It is a conundrum for sure.</i>

1351
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:12,083
Would you rather be a gray slab of
flesh with a fishhook in your nose?

1352
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:15,167
I will feel good for a second,
but bad for longer, so...

1353
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:18,208
I really had a
fishhook in my nose?

1354
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:19,417
You did.

1355
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:23,500
So, I am your creation

1356
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:26,375
as is the other one.

1357
01:55:26,542 --> 01:55:28,042
Neither of you are that.

1358
01:55:28,208 --> 01:55:31,083
She wanders the halls
with a hammer and a song,

1359
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,833
and that is not my doing.

1360
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:35,625
And I read your cards
and letters home,

1361
01:55:35,792 --> 01:55:39,208
and watched you fearlessly
create Bella Baxter with wonder.

1362
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:43,083
I am finding being alive fascinating,
so I'll forgive you the act,

1363
01:55:43,917 --> 01:55:46,167
but always hate the lies
and trapping that followed.

1364
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:48,292
Understood.

1365
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:54,875
Good to see you.

1366
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:56,333
You too.

1367
01:55:57,792 --> 01:56:00,958
Anger, confusion, and brain
dissonance aside, I missed you.

1368
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:04,333
I arrived home, and I
smelled the formaldehyde,

1369
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,958
and I knew what is next.

1370
01:56:08,667 --> 01:56:09,958
I will be a doctor.

1371
01:56:11,333 --> 01:56:13,417
My surgery is yours.

1372
01:56:15,292 --> 01:56:16,583
My father once told me

1373
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:20,792
always carve with compassion.

1374
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:22,958
He was a fucking idiot.

1375
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:25,583
But it's not bad advice.

1376
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,375
He does not have long.

1377
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:32,542
I know.

1378
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:35,833
You've not mentioned
our betrothal.

1379
01:56:37,667 --> 01:56:39,583
You were much younger.

1380
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:42,042
There is no bind.

1381
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:45,208
I was mesmerized by you,
and Baxter took advantage.

1382
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:47,125
So, you are mesmerized no more?

1383
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,375
I am still mesmerized.

1384
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:52,417
I've been a whore,
you understand?

1385
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:55,667
Cocks for money inside me.

1386
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:56,958
You okay with that?

1387
01:56:57,792 --> 01:57:00,125
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire,

1388
01:57:00,292 --> 01:57:02,125
for ownership that men have?

1389
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:04,667
Wedderburn became
much weepy and sweary

1390
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:06,375
when he discovered my whoring.

1391
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,750
I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you

1392
01:57:10,917 --> 01:57:13,958
rather than any moral
aspersion against you.

1393
01:57:14,125 --> 01:57:15,667
It is your body, Bella Baxter.

1394
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:17,542
Yours to give freely.

1395
01:57:18,583 --> 01:57:20,083
I generally charged 30 francs.

1396
01:57:20,542 --> 01:57:22,833
Well, that seems low.

1397
01:57:24,042 --> 01:57:26,750
Do you believe people
improvable, Max?

1398
01:57:26,917 --> 01:57:27,750
I do.

1399
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:30,875
Just as a human body
can be cured of illness,

1400
01:57:31,042 --> 01:57:34,375
so can men and women
be cured of aspect.

1401
01:57:36,583 --> 01:57:38,500
Will you marry
me, Max McCandles?

1402
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:41,750
I will.

1403
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,684
We will need less of your
tongue in the future,

1404
01:57:50,708 --> 01:57:52,417
but overall, most agreeable.

1405
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:54,417
I will take that note.

1406
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:59,542
And have you been
checked for disease?

1407
01:57:59,708 --> 01:58:01,458
I have not, but I shall.

1408
01:58:02,125 --> 01:58:04,292
I'm enjoying this
practical love we have.

1409
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:09,375
But I assure you mine
is also passionate.

1410
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:11,542
You are adorable.

1411
01:58:12,333 --> 01:58:13,500
You always were.

1412
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:24,750
God, you are walking.

1413
01:58:24,917 --> 01:58:28,417
I have taken five milligrams of
heroin through the toes for pain

1414
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:29,875
amphetamines for energy,

1415
01:58:30,042 --> 01:58:33,667
and cocaine because I
am partial to cocaine.

1416
01:58:33,833 --> 01:58:36,833
I've come here to walk
you down the aisle.

1417
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,333
And so, by the powers vested
in me by the church...

1418
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,250
I shall solemnize this union.

1419
01:58:55,375 --> 01:58:59,208
Do you, Bella Baxter, take
this man as your husband?

1420
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:02,167
Did we miss the part about
anyone objecting to this?

1421
01:59:02,792 --> 01:59:07,708
Or has that been removed in some kind
of faux modernization of the catechism?

1422
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:12,458
Hello, Victoria.

1423
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:14,250
You look well.

1424
01:59:15,417 --> 01:59:17,375
Do you refer to me, sir?

1425
01:59:17,542 --> 01:59:20,250
A man doesn't normally
introduce himself to his wife.

1426
01:59:20,417 --> 01:59:21,875
But if I must...

1427
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:24,750
He is the God of it.

1428
01:59:25,375 --> 01:59:27,958
I do not know if he's in
her power or she in his.

1429
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:30,125
'Tis Devil's work at hand. Look!

1430
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:33,167
He coughs not air as a
normal man but blood.

1431
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:35,125
He has cancer,
you fucking idiot.

1432
01:59:36,958 --> 01:59:37,792
Duncan.

1433
01:59:37,958 --> 01:59:40,125
Do not lay your
eyes on me, demon!

1434
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:45,750
As I was saying, General
Alfred Blessington.

1435
01:59:46,542 --> 01:59:48,167
"Alfie" to you.

1436
01:59:48,333 --> 01:59:49,792
You really do not know me?

1437
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:53,250
When Mr. Wedderburn put
your photo in the paper...

1438
01:59:53,417 --> 01:59:57,833
I remembered that old bird in the
hotel called you Victoria Blessington,

1439
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,250
and I pieced this diabolical
fuckfest of a puzzle together.

1440
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,083
- You are...
- Your dear Alfie.

1441
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:11,417
You left in a state of some mental
addlement and hysteria over your pregnancy.

1442
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:15,542
On the discovery of your
absence, I felt disemboweled.

1443
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:18,708
I have disemboweled men
on the field of battle,

1444
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:23,208
and I always imagined a
dull, hollow throbbing,

1445
02:00:23,708 --> 02:00:25,750
and that is what it was like.

1446
02:00:26,625 --> 02:00:31,292
There's also a stench, but that
does not apply as a metaphor here.

1447
02:00:32,667 --> 02:00:34,500
But here you are, my darling.

1448
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:36,542
Here you are.

1449
02:00:36,958 --> 02:00:37,958
God.

1450
02:00:38,042 --> 02:00:39,833
I have no recollection of you.

1451
02:00:40,708 --> 02:00:42,292
I am Bella Baxter.

1452
02:00:42,458 --> 02:00:43,542
Hurtful.

1453
02:00:44,208 --> 02:00:45,667
But perhaps you've
hit your head,

1454
02:00:45,833 --> 02:00:48,042
and these men have clearly
taken advantage of you.

1455
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:49,958
Please go, sir.

1456
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,083
- You were my husband?
- Your dear Alfie.

1457
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,375
Bella, I'm sorry.

1458
02:01:02,542 --> 02:01:04,208
Actually, I would like to go.

1459
02:01:04,792 --> 02:01:05,625
What?

1460
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,792
Bella?

1461
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,042
You have a carriage, sir?

1462
02:01:13,167 --> 02:01:14,250
Yes.

1463
02:01:14,417 --> 02:01:15,417
Let us go then.

1464
02:01:15,542 --> 02:01:16,542
Bella!

1465
02:01:16,583 --> 02:01:17,833
Let me go, God.

1466
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:20,083
Max, you will not stop me.

1467
02:01:29,292 --> 02:01:31,333
It is good to have
you back, Victoria.

1468
02:01:47,792 --> 02:01:49,632
The servants and I have
not been getting along.

1469
02:01:49,667 --> 02:01:51,083
I fear an uprising.

1470
02:02:01,167 --> 02:02:02,667
You remember David, darling?

1471
02:02:04,875 --> 02:02:07,125
Allison, look who's back.

1472
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:14,958
You know me?

1473
02:02:16,792 --> 02:02:18,167
Tell me about myself.

1474
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,750
Was I nice?

1475
02:02:59,083 --> 02:03:00,083
Eat.

1476
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:02,667
All your favorites.

1477
02:03:02,833 --> 02:03:04,750
Kippers, goose

1478
02:03:05,542 --> 02:03:08,083
tongue, champagne.

1479
02:03:08,875 --> 02:03:09,875
I've missed you.

1480
02:03:11,958 --> 02:03:13,958
What was the root
of the unhappiness?

1481
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:17,958
What drove her to
leap off the bridge?

1482
02:03:20,833 --> 02:03:22,500
You hated the baby.

1483
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:24,250
You called it "the monster."

1484
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:26,542
I see.

1485
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:30,500
I have noticed a lack
of maternal instinct.

1486
02:03:32,167 --> 02:03:34,000
And yet I'm happy
to have you home.

1487
02:03:36,667 --> 02:03:37,792
How did we meet?

1488
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:39,958
At a ball.

1489
02:03:40,125 --> 02:03:41,542
Why did we like each other?

1490
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:44,958
We shared a love of good times.

1491
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:47,750
Watch.

1492
02:03:49,167 --> 02:03:51,125
Allison, soup!

1493
02:04:00,917 --> 02:04:01,917
Rex!

1494
02:04:07,583 --> 02:04:08,375
Fuck!

1495
02:04:08,542 --> 02:04:09,625
Allison

1496
02:04:10,375 --> 02:04:12,042
we'll have some
cheese when you can.

1497
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:20,042
A love of cruelty?

1498
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:25,208
- I was not a kind person, it seems.
- Kind?

1499
02:04:25,833 --> 02:04:27,917
You would never be
so dull, Victoria.

1500
02:04:28,083 --> 02:04:29,250
Appalling idea.

1501
02:04:30,458 --> 02:04:31,875
Wedderburn says
you were a whore.

1502
02:04:32,042 --> 02:04:33,833
- I suspect that was part...
- I was.

1503
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
In Paris.

1504
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:37,792
I tired of it, but
it was fascinating.

1505
02:04:39,125 --> 02:04:41,750
- Right.
- These kippers are strangely delicious.

1506
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:44,292
Vinegary or something.

1507
02:04:51,292 --> 02:04:53,375
Marriage is a
constant challenge.

1508
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,500
Some, we bend to,
some we bend to us.

1509
02:04:59,167 --> 02:05:01,292
I will try to forgive
you for the whoring.

1510
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,125
Your sexual hysteria
was often out of hand.

1511
02:05:05,833 --> 02:05:07,750
And for the killing
of our unborn child.

1512
02:05:08,792 --> 02:05:11,250
In fact, when I list the
ways you've wronged me...

1513
02:05:11,417 --> 02:05:15,417
Jesus Christ himself would probably
beat your head in with a bat.

1514
02:05:19,208 --> 02:05:21,000
You're blessed with
a forgiving husband.

1515
02:05:22,833 --> 02:05:24,667
I've not wronged you, Alfie

1516
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:26,625
as I do not know you.

1517
02:05:26,792 --> 02:05:30,708
Well, you're in luck as I've had a lot
of experience in the field with amnesia.

1518
02:05:30,875 --> 02:05:33,583
Either men who wish to
forget where they were,

1519
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:35,667
or a mortar exploded nearby

1520
02:05:35,833 --> 02:05:37,875
ringing their cranium
like a church bell.

1521
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:41,750
I suggest we stick close to
the house for several months

1522
02:05:41,917 --> 02:05:43,083
maybe a year.

1523
02:05:45,875 --> 02:05:47,542
Until you've made
a full recovery.

1524
02:05:50,167 --> 02:05:53,708
I will leave at my leisure, but I am
flattered by your desire to trap me.

1525
02:05:55,917 --> 02:05:57,083
You're not the first.

1526
02:05:59,167 --> 02:06:01,375
I will have to shoot
you in the fucking head

1527
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,833
if you try to leave, darling.

1528
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,667
The front or the
back of the head?

1529
02:06:05,833 --> 02:06:07,167
The back.

1530
02:06:07,333 --> 02:06:08,708
As to be sure you were leaving,

1531
02:06:08,875 --> 02:06:10,667
and I was not being rash.

1532
02:06:16,208 --> 02:06:17,750
I have missed you.

1533
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:23,458
So, I'm a prisoner?

1534
02:06:24,167 --> 02:06:27,167
This conversation has gone
down an unfortunate route.

1535
02:06:28,208 --> 02:06:30,958
I am sure you will be as
happy as you were before.

1536
02:06:32,292 --> 02:06:34,833
As I was before when I
threw myself from a bridge?

1537
02:06:41,167 --> 02:06:43,875
I suspect you fell
while looking for fish.

1538
02:06:45,583 --> 02:06:48,250
Why would you want to keep me
here if I do not wish to stay?

1539
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:53,208
If one must drown, let it
be in the river of love.

1540
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
David

1541
02:07:05,292 --> 02:07:07,458
does that pheasant look
stripped to the bone?

1542
02:07:07,917 --> 02:07:09,750
It was a misjudgment, sir.

1543
02:07:10,375 --> 02:07:11,917
I apologize.

1544
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:22,125
Dessert, darling?

1545
02:08:20,417 --> 02:08:22,000
It comes off easy?

1546
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:23,583
Like a button on a suit.

1547
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:27,250
I saw them do it in Africa
with sharpened rocks,

1548
02:08:27,417 --> 02:08:31,083
but had my own more
precise device made.

1549
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:34,250
Do you want just clitoral hood,

1550
02:08:34,417 --> 02:08:36,000
or glans as well?

1551
02:08:36,167 --> 02:08:37,958
The whole infernal packet.

1552
02:08:38,125 --> 02:08:40,042
It will calm her no end.

1553
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,750
This time we will get it done.

1554
02:08:42,542 --> 02:08:45,182
I shall get her sedated and bring
her to your surgery this evening.

1555
02:08:55,583 --> 02:08:57,875
Victoria, darling!

1556
02:08:59,208 --> 02:09:00,375
Where are you?

1557
02:09:05,875 --> 02:09:07,250
Perfect timing.

1558
02:09:07,417 --> 02:09:08,417
Martini.

1559
02:09:08,458 --> 02:09:09,708
Rather not.

1560
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,167
I would, however, like to leave.

1561
02:09:12,625 --> 02:09:14,667
I have found our time
together interesting,

1562
02:09:14,833 --> 02:09:17,375
but I've ascertained why
I jumped from a bridge.

1563
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:20,750
I wish to go see
my near dead God.

1564
02:09:21,375 --> 02:09:22,375
Adorable idea.

1565
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,000
Unfortunately, my darling

1566
02:09:24,167 --> 02:09:27,250
my life is dedicated to
the taking of territory.

1567
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:28,250
You are mine,

1568
02:09:28,417 --> 02:09:30,500
and that is the long
and short of it.

1569
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:32,708
I am not territory.

1570
02:09:32,875 --> 02:09:36,500
The root of the problem
is between your legs.

1571
02:09:36,667 --> 02:09:37,667
I will have it off,

1572
02:09:37,833 --> 02:09:40,667
and it will not distract
and divert you anymore.

1573
02:09:40,833 --> 02:09:43,917
You see, a man spends his life
wrangling his sexual compulsions.

1574
02:09:44,083 --> 02:09:47,208
It's a curse and yet, in
some ways, his life's work.

1575
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:49,417
A woman's life's
work is children.

1576
02:09:49,583 --> 02:09:52,583
I intend to rid you of that
infernal packet between your legs,

1577
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:55,000
and plant a seed in
you straight after.

1578
02:09:55,167 --> 02:09:57,417
Let me explain
what has happened.

1579
02:09:57,583 --> 02:10:01,417
Victoria, your wife, threw
herself from a bridge and died.

1580
02:10:01,583 --> 02:10:04,625
Godwin Baxter found her,
brought her to his surgery.

1581
02:10:04,792 --> 02:10:07,917
He then removed the baby,
removed the brain from the baby

1582
02:10:08,083 --> 02:10:11,042
transplanted it into my
head and reanimated me.

1583
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,917
I'll bring you the file. It's
actually quite fascinating.

1584
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:15,875
However, I will
keep my new life,

1585
02:10:16,042 --> 02:10:18,417
and my lovely old
clitoris, thank you.

1586
02:10:18,583 --> 02:10:20,208
If you'd call a carriage for me.

1587
02:10:21,042 --> 02:10:22,042
They talk and talk,

1588
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:24,750
and yet at some point there's
nothing left but to pull a gun.

1589
02:10:26,333 --> 02:10:27,792
'Tis the way with women.

1590
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:41,750
Are you giving in?

1591
02:10:42,792 --> 02:10:45,750
I'd rather you shot me
in the fucking heart.

1592
02:10:45,917 --> 02:10:48,208
I will oblige if I have to.

1593
02:10:49,833 --> 02:10:51,417
Drink the drink, darling.

1594
02:10:52,292 --> 02:10:53,292
Chloroform and gin.

1595
02:11:03,083 --> 02:11:06,875
In some ways it would be a relief
to be rid of my questing self.

1596
02:11:07,375 --> 02:11:09,833
Sip deeply and that
freedom is yours.

1597
02:11:22,583 --> 02:11:23,583
Fuck.

1598
02:11:38,333 --> 02:11:39,333
Max?

1599
02:11:42,542 --> 02:11:45,625
Max. We have to
get him to surgery.

1600
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:47,708
He'll die if we don't.

1601
02:11:47,875 --> 02:11:48,958
Bleeding a lot.

1602
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:51,208
You're fucking dead.

1603
02:11:52,333 --> 02:11:53,917
Bella, if he lives...

1604
02:11:54,083 --> 02:11:57,542
I do not sense he is
a man who will stop.

1605
02:11:58,042 --> 02:11:59,750
Well, I won't watch
him bleed to death.

1606
02:12:00,292 --> 02:12:02,333
But I agree, he could
do with improvement.

1607
02:12:15,375 --> 02:12:17,375
I've removed the bullet
and stopped the bleeding.

1608
02:12:17,958 --> 02:12:19,292
I have the notes.

1609
02:12:27,375 --> 02:12:29,792
I am never happier
than when I'm in here.

1610
02:13:02,542 --> 02:13:04,000
Bella.

1611
02:13:04,167 --> 02:13:05,375
You're back.

1612
02:13:11,292 --> 02:13:13,750
It was just a story
of someone else

1613
02:13:14,958 --> 02:13:16,458
not Bella Baxter.

1614
02:13:24,417 --> 02:13:27,375
All my life, people's
eyes looked at me

1615
02:13:27,542 --> 02:13:29,500
horror, pity,

1616
02:13:31,208 --> 02:13:32,375
but you.

1617
02:13:39,917 --> 02:13:42,000
It's all very interesting

1618
02:13:44,042 --> 02:13:45,667
what is happening.

1619
02:14:45,542 --> 02:14:47,458
Anatomy exam is
making me nervous.

1620
02:14:47,625 --> 02:14:50,042
I've tested you many
times. You know it.

1621
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,458
No one knows anatomy
