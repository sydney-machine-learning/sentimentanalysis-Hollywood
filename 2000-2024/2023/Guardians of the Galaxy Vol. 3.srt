1
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>Couldn't look you in the eye</i>

2
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>You're just like an angel</i>

3
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>Your skin makes me cry</i>

4
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,159
Come on, Drax. Dance.

5
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,786
Only idiots dance.

6
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,005
{\an8}<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

7
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,695
{\an8}<i>I want to have control</i>

8
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,369
<i>I want a perfect body</i>

9
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,611
{\an8}Hey!

10
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,116
{\an8}I told you a million times...

11
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,328
{\an8}you keep your grimy raccoon hands
off my Zune.

12
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,417
{\an8}I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

13
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,855
Again?

14
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,140
I love you, Gamora.

15
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,811
So, what are you gonna do about Quill?

16
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,771
Me? Why not you?

17
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,025
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

18
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,359
Why are you on the ceiling?

19
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,404
I wanted to see if these new gravity boots
worked on a slope.

20
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,620
Here we go.

21
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,761
Sorry.

22
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,686
<i>Bozhe moi,</i> Kraglin.

23
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,480
You must know you will never learn.

24
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,190
You think you could do better?

25
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,880
Telekinesis is cheating!

26
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,007
That's a stupid little pebble!

27
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,093
I could do that with my dang finger!

28
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,928
You're a bad dog.

29
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,681
{\an8}Do not say that to me.

30
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,391
You are. You're a bad dog.

31
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,934
Take that back.

32
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,352
Come on, that's not cool.

33
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,604
Nebula, did you hear?

34
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,732
He called me a bad dog,
and he refused to take it back.

35
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,442
I don't care, Cosmo.

36
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,528
-Is Peter okay?
-I don't know.

37
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,529
What are you going to do?

38
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,865
Me? He's your brother.

39
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,158
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

40
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,036
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

41
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,413
She's not dead.

42
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,165
She just doesn't remember anything
from the past few years.

43
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,542
Nobody tells me nothing.

44
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,920
Mantis, why don't you just touch him
and, you know, make him happy?

45
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:42,921
I am Groot?

46
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:43,881
-Dude!
-Gross!

47
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,884
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

48
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,469
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

49
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,763
'Bout that time
you made me fall in love with my sock?

50
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,307
Well, that was funny.

51
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,851
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

52
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,144
Maybe we should draw straws.

53
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,146
No one ever meant that, Drax.

54
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,664
-What was that?
-What was that?

55
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,831
What the hell?

56
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,999
Oh, my God!

57
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,209
Is he okay?

58
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,302
Hey!

59
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,138
Where did you go, squirrel?

60
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,147
On the ground!

61
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,545
No, stop! Don't!

62
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,132
Stop, please! No! Stop, please!

63
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,300
Please!

64
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,043
Who is that maniac?

65
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,047
Some super douche with ray gun hands,
I don't frickin' know.

66
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:08,836
Who threw this thing at me?

67
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,546
Shut up.

68
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,215
Baby.

69
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,858
Pick on someone your own size.

70
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,385
Peter!

71
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,679
Peter!

72
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,097
We need Med-Paks!

73
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,779
Nebula!

74
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,947
Piss off.

75
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,015
Rocket.

76
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,411
That hurts.

77
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,497
What a pity.

78
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,473
No!

79
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,895
All I did was activate the Med-Paks!

80
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,647
Get them off! Now!

81
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,442
Oh, hell.

82
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,277
We need to get him to the Med-Bay!

83
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,279
It was destroyed. There's one on the ship.

84
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,287
Lill ol od for today.

85
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,209
Stitch him up and transfer him in
with the rest of Batch 89.

86
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,575
It's okay.

87
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,577
You're here with us now.

88
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,956
Hey! It's a new guy.

89
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,791
What kind of thing are you?

90
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,627
You've got, like, a mask on your face.

91
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,508
Mask, eyes, face, mouth...

92
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,301
does it words?

93
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:31,056
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

94
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,105
Hurts.

95
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,714
It's okay.

96
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,260
You're gonna be okay.

97
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,556
A kill switch?

98
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,685
A device set to destruct
if anyone goes poking around inside him...

99
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,061
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

100
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,938
And why would Rocket have a kill switch?

101
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,316
Apparently, someone considers him
proprietary technology...

102
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,776
and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

103
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,445
So, he'll die if we operate on him?

104
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,446
And he'll die if we don't.

105
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,864
There has to be some way to bypass it.

106
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,575
It looks like there's a passkey
that could override the kill switch.

107
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,994
What do we know
about where Rocket came from?

108
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,078
He won't talk about it.

109
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,748
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

110
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,958
And there's a code on all of it...

111
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,711
89P13.

112
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,755
He's got maybe 48 hours.

113
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,467
Where are you going?

114
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,968
OrgoCorp have to have records, right?

115
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,180
Maybe they'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

116
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,723
They won't just give us that information.

117
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,225
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

118
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,310
We kill anyone who gets in our way!

119
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,062
-Not kill anyone.
-Kill a few people.

120
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,104
Kill no people.

121
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,815
Kill one guy,
one stupid guy who no one loves.

122
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,692
Now you're just making it sad.

123
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,032
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch...

124
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,867
<i>over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.</i>

125
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,453
-Aye, Cap'n.
-Aye, comrade.

126
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,249
Take back what you said,
that I'm a bad dog.

127
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,290
Nope.

128
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,544
I know you don't really think
I am a bad dog.

129
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,711
Can you please take it back?

130
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,878
I will not.

131
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,842
I located the coordinates for OrgoCorp.

132
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,636
I think I have a contact near there.
Maybe they can help us get in.

133
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:33,637
Contact him.

134
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,473
Let's go save our friend.

135
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,891
No, no, no.

136
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,496
It's good to have friends.

137
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,423
Oh, my poor baby.

138
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,926
It hurts.

139
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,762
Do you have it?

140
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:57,930
He does not, sire.

141
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,891
I tried to warn you, High Evolutionary.

142
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,352
These Guardians are more powerful
than you think.

143
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,190
Or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value, High Priestess.

144
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,902
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

145
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,863
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

146
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,907
Beautiful numbskulls.

147
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,118
But your egos have run wild. Say, "Ah."

148
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,164
And this one
was meant to be the Warlock...

149
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,832
the apogee of their people.

150
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,293
You removed Adam from his cocoon early...

151
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,545
my liege.

152
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,129
He's still a child.

153
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,966
No, there's something wrong with him
even outside all that.

154
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,676
Yes, there's something wrong with me!

155
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,053
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus!

156
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,641
He doesn't know any better.
We shall do whatever you require, my liege.

157
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:46,228
You knew of 89P13's existence for years
without alerting me.

158
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,313
That's not what I require!

159
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,318
I'm sorry, my liege.

160
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,488
Find 89P13 and return it to me...

161
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:01,660
or I will destroy your entire civilization,
as is my right as your maker.

162
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,620
Do you understand?

163
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,794
Do you understand?

164
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,255
Yes, sire.

165
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,841
Toodle-do.

166
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,180
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

167
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,098
It was always clever, sire.

168
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,475
-Yes, that's exactly why I want it now.
-Of course.

169
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,312
-Its brain.
-That is the only reason, sire.

170
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,649
But are you really trusting the Sovereign
to retrieve it?

171
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,361
They're merely a backup.
I believe I know where they're going.

172
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,939
It's bio-formed.

173
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,650
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

174
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,154
The structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields.

175
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,657
It's not going to be easy
to break into this place, Star-Lord.

176
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,701
Doesn't have to be easy.
I was a professional thief, remember?

177
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,286
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

178
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,207
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

179
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,542
She's always mad...

180
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,960
at everyone.

181
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,255
It's because I was drunk.

182
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,550
She's right.

183
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,801
If I hadn't been drinking...

184
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,887
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

185
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,306
It's okay. He's your best friend.

186
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,808
Second best friend.

187
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:52,688
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

188
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:53,856
Gamora isn't dead.

189
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,066
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

190
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,277
Thank you.

191
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,949
First shield set.

192
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,286
Three, two...

193
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,122
one.

194
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:16,837
-Peter.
-What?

195
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,006
You had family on Earth...

196
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,091
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

197
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,845
No, you're my sister.
That's all the family I want or need.

198
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,515
Besides, it was really just my grandpa, okay?
He was a pretty hard guy.

199
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,517
Still. Don't you think he...

200
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,269
What?

201
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,981
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

202
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,524
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

203
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,068
My mom died, he screamed in my face,
he pushed me out of the room!

204
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,487
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

205
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,281
-What are you talking about?
-What?

206
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,700
I'm talking about the people in my life
who died, and you're talking about this?

207
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,701
Second shield set.

208
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,411
<i>Three, two...</i>

209
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:50,621
<i>one.</i>

210
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,668
I'm only saying...

211
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,129
you've never even gone
to see if he's okay.

212
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,672
He could still be alive.

213
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,510
My grandpa, he'd be, like,
90-something years old.

214
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,094
So he could still be alive.

215
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,055
People on Earth die when they're, like, 50.

216
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,806
They die when they're 50?

217
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,558
I don't know. Something like that.

218
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,352
What's even the point of being born?

219
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,478
Exactly!

220
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,271
Are you about to die?

221
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,233
I'm not 50!

222
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,444
The point is...

223
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:24,780
I wasn't talking about any of this.

224
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:27,741
Third shield set.

225
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,744
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

226
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,414
Well, not everything
is about what you are talking about.

227
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,916
And I'm only saying...

228
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,670
you are upset because so many of the people
you cared about have left you...

229
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,797
but you also left someone.

230
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,132
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

231
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,218
It's too late. They're all gone.

232
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,399
Why didn't we go through?

233
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,488
We did. It's not the shield.

234
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,077
Oh, hell.

235
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,540
Ravagers.

236
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,417
<i>Hey, guys...</i>

237
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,961
<i>you're about to be boarded
by the United Ravagers.</i>

238
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,922
<i>You can surrender and turn over
any stuff worth anything and live...</i>

239
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,632
<i>or you can die.</i>

240
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,050
<i>Totes up to you.</i>

241
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,735
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

242
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,029
Guys, it's me, Peter Quill,
I'm one of you, remember?

243
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,071
Hold on!

244
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,156
We have an appointment!

245
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,157
We have an appointment.

246
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,074
With who?

247
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,202
-With Gamora.
-With Gamora.

248
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,203
What?

249
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,704
You're early.

250
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,180
What are these?

251
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,682
OrgoCorp uniforms.

252
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,977
You're gonna have to wear these
to move through the Orgo...

253
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,271
without attracting attention.

254
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,689
This isn't my color.

255
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,361
What did you say?

256
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,238
It clashes with my eyes.

257
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,993
Put it on!

258
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,290
Nebula, why would you not tell me
that you've been in contact with Gamora?

259
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,875
Because I didn't want you to get freaked out.

260
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,043
Freaked out how?

261
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,336
Like that.

262
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:45,838
Let me in there.

263
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,631
I don't wanna be trapped out here,
I can't...

264
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:50,092
Gamora, we are grateful for your help.

265
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,719
Oh, I'm not doing this
out of the kindness of my heart.

266
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,598
I'm doing this for the hundred thousand
units my sister promised.

267
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,226
So, you're a Ravager now?

268
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:00,727
Put on the uniform.

269
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,563
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

270
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,107
Who are you again?

271
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,733
Oh, man.

272
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,028
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced...

273
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,990
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy...

274
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,120
<i>so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.</i>

275
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:21,665
<i>Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock...</i>

276
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:24,126
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

277
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:28,881
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records...

278
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,258
where maybe you can find the passkey...

279
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,719
to override the kill switch...

280
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,888
and help you save the hedgehog.

281
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,223
But if you get into trouble...

282
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,768
we will not be able to bail you out.

283
00:26:58,994 --> 00:26:59,995
Yes.

284
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,165
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

285
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,794
His functioning has skyrocketed.

286
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,050
That's correct, P13.

287
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,551
Very good.

288
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,184
That's the new world.

289
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,727
Counter-Earth.

290
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,730
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

291
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,190
It blue.

292
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,358
That's the sky.

293
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,859
Sky.

294
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,072
Rocket.

295
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,740
Yes, it is.

296
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,243
What sounds?

297
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,329
That's music.

298
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:43,622
We like it?

299
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,123
We do.

300
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:49,253
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

301
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:54,007
"Mo Ergastee Förn, Mo Ergalone Förn Nort."

302
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,218
Which, translated, is...

303
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,847
"Be not as you are, but as you should be."

304
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,015
It's our sacred mission...

305
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:05,018
to take the cacophony of sounds around us...

306
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,272
and turn it into a song.

307
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,568
To take an imperfect clump...

308
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,529
of biological matter such as you...

309
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:18,615
and transform it into something...

310
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,284
perfect.

311
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,747
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

312
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,587
Come with me, P13.

313
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,714
I'd like to show you something.

314
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,012
<i>We have but a single quest...</i>

315
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,848
to create the perfect species...

316
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,017
and the perfect society.

317
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,686
You, P13...

318
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,105
are part of Batch 89.

319
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,649
But here with Batch 90...

320
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,153
I've developed a process
by which I can guide...

321
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,780
any organism through millions of years...

322
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,533
of programmed evolutionary changes...

323
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,577
in a moment.

324
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:38,278
See, now, there's the rub.

325
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:40,739
For some reason...

326
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:44,076
these specimens are also over-producing...

327
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,955
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems...

328
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,706
causing them to be, well...

329
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,042
Violent. We don't like it.

330
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,963
A utopia can't have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

331
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,256
It can'ts.

332
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,174
Can't.

333
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,467
Can't.

334
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:01,844
Theel.

335
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,892
They're programmed to be peaceful.
Like you.

336
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,437
But for some reason, it's not catching.

337
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,148
Hyptonic filters.

338
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,316
What?

339
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:20,404
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

340
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:24,950
And then boop-boop-boop,
halfcystine residual be formin'...

341
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,619
and then, they make...

342
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,121
What do you say?

343
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,331
Loligo beta-microseminoproteins.

344
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:32,958
Yeah, thems.

345
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,794
And then, angry turtleses.

346
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:27,429
<i>There. That's the decompression chamber.</i>

347
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,181
<i>Lock in.</i>

348
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,442
<i>Go.</i>

349
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,474
<i>Activate gravity boots and gloves.</i>

350
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,276
<i>Nebula, go.</i>

351
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,730
<i>So, you really don't remember anything?</i>

352
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:00,898
<i>Like what?</i>

353
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:02,816
<i>'Bout your time with us.</i>

354
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:04,943
<i>No.</i>

355
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,236
<i>We were...</i>

356
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:08,280
<i>We weren't anything.</i>

357
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:09,448
<i>You and me...</i>

358
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:13,327
<i>That person was
some alternate future version of me.</i>

359
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:15,704
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

360
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,498
<i>We loved each other.</i>

361
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,960
<i>I don't think so.</i>

362
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,422
<i>I know you don't remember any of it.</i>

363
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,052
<i>You were everything to me.</i>

364
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,306
<i>And I miss you...</i>

365
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,142
<i>so much.</i>

366
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:39,561
<i>And, maybe...</i>

367
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,023
<i>maybe, if you open yourself up to it...</i>

368
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,901
<i>there's a possibility...</i>

369
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,653
<i>I don't think so, Quinn.</i>

370
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:49,780
<i>Quill.</i>

371
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,031
<i>Quill.</i>

372
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,159
<i>I don't think so.</i>

373
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:55,369
<i>Well, what I'm trying to say...</i>

374
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,704
<i>Peter, you know
this is an open line, right?</i>

375
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:58,914
<i>What?</i>

376
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,541
<i>We're listening
to everything you're saying.</i>

377
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,626
<i>And it is painful.</i>

378
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:03,919
<i>And you're just telling me now?</i>

379
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,587
<i>We were hoping it would stop on its own.</i>

380
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:06,630
<i>But I switched it over to private!</i>

381
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,090
<i>What color button did you push?</i>

382
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,299
<i>Blue, for the blue suit!</i>

383
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,384
<i>Oh, no!</i>

384
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,177
<i>Blue is the open line for everyone.</i>

385
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,012
<i>-Orange is for blue.
-What?</i>

386
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,264
<i>Black is for orange...</i>

387
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,184
<i>yellow is for green, green is for red,
and red is for yellow.</i>

388
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,726
<i>No. Yellow is for yellow...</i>

389
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,521
<i>green is for red, red is for green.</i>

390
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,273
<i>-I don't think so.
-Try it then.</i>

391
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,025
<i>Hello!</i>

392
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,152
<i>You were right.</i>

393
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,114
<i>How the hell am I supposed to
know all of that?</i>

394
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,197
<i>Seems intuitive.</i>

395
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,034
<i>Can we get back to saving our friend?</i>

396
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,496
<i>Get that jammer ready to change the shield.</i>

397
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:14,865
<i>Guys?</i>

398
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:18,994
I mean, you wanna talk about a sweet ride?
The acceleration will crush your spine.

399
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,538
It's got that brand-new fusalix core.
You know what I'm talking about?

400
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,748
Yeah.

401
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,208
Really? 'Cause I just made that up.

402
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,752
I thought you said somethin' else.

403
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:28,837
Master Karja.

404
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,466
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

405
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,177
Master Karja, there appears to be
a physical breach...

406
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,428
<i>in the white wing somewhere.</i>

407
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,138
-Could it be a glitch?
<i>-Maybe.</i>

408
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,938
I'm accessing the eye.

409
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,606
I'll see if I can locate it.

410
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,349
There's some sort of anomaly
in the decompression chamber.

411
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,184
<i>-Best you check it out, Master.
</i>-On it.

412
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:26,728
Hurry.

413
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:39,700
Where do we put these?

414
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:44,246
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

415
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:52,504
Hurry!

416
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,898
What the hell was that, guys?

417
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,568
What, are you kidding me?

418
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:15,819
What?

419
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:19,323
A neutro-quark just hit the satellite.

420
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:21,283
It's burning a hole through the wall.
You geniuses...

421
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,245
you just throw the door open without
any proper precautionary procedure?

422
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,830
What procedure, bro?

423
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:30,334
You want us to read the manual
for you too, bro?

424
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,544
You could have killed everyone in the wing!

425
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,922
Exactly! You idiots!

426
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:36,465
I'm angry too!

427
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:37,591
Oh, no.

428
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,842
I mean, can't you see...

429
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,054
these authentic mechanic uniforms
that we're wearing on our bodies?

430
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,515
That blend in with some of our skin-tones
better than others?

431
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,433
Excuse my friend.

432
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,685
He is the boss' nephew. He's a little...

433
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:57,194
Yeah. I got one of those too.

434
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:00,030
I mean, this one? This one I love.

435
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,240
I'm so proud.

436
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,866
You're doing great. So proud of you.

437
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,785
But this one, I just...

438
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,253
-Everything he does drives me crazy.
-Yeah.

439
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,672
-I thought you said something else.
-Shut up.

440
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,549
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

441
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:21,093
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

442
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,636
How'd you guys get here so fast?

443
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,388
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in...

444
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,890
before it burned
all the way through, thankfully.

445
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,433
Good thing you were here.

446
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,477
All right, guys, wrap it up.

447
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,688
Looks like we're all clear here.

448
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:38,694
Our spacesuits!

449
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:44,366
You threw them in the contamination bin.

450
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,119
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

451
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,955
That would have been helpful information
three minutes ago.

452
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,082
Damn it, Mantis, why don't you ever think?

453
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,293
Are we pretending to be angry again?

454
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:55,586
Mantis, you asshole!

455
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,213
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

456
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,590
We'll find another way out of here.

457
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,801
Right now, we need to save Rocket's life.

458
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:07,431
Nebula, Quinn, and I will get to the records
and get the passkey.

459
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,100
Bug and Doofus, access the spaceport
through the elevator...

460
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,519
so Tree can land and get us out of here.

461
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,104
Apologies.

462
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:15,272
No problem.

463
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,482
Go.

464
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,081
Not my fault I don't know something...

465
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,666
if no one ever tells me.

466
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,293
I didn't even wanna come here.

467
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,920
I'm gonna need to see your...

468
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,088
You're hopelessly in love...

469
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:41,757
with him.

470
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,300
Oh, no.

471
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,093
Hey.

472
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,261
Hey.

473
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,680
How you doin' today?

474
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,016
I'm all right.

475
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,437
What was your name again?

476
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,189
Drax the Destroyer.

477
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,567
That is such a lovely name.

478
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,153
I'll get the door for you.

479
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,866
-I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
-Sure.

480
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,536
Every single time.

481
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,331
My name is Bletelsnort.

482
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,960
<i>Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.</i>

483
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:19,795
<i>For over 300 years...</i>

484
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:22,548
<i>OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants...</i>

485
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,175
<i>and genetic upgrades across the universe...</i>

486
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:28,762
<i>under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.</i>

487
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,100
That warning we got today,
don't those two match the description?

488
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:35,644
Attention, all Orgosentries...

489
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,148
That manager should have access
to the records.

490
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,861
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

491
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,280
All right. I'll handle this one.

492
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,489
How?

493
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,867
Pure Star-Lord charm.

494
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:53,203
I'm excited for you that you get to
see this again for the first time.

495
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:01,920
Hi, Yura.

496
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,463
Ura.

497
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,007
-Ura.
-Hi.

498
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,217
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

499
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,888
I've been noticing you for quite a while...

500
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,806
and the way that you smile to yourself...

501
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,850
when you think nobody is looking...

502
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:16,977
it makes my every day a bit brighter.

503
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,021
We need your hand.
And it's your choice...

504
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,522
whether it's on your body or not.

505
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,816
-What are you doing?
-She was never gonna fall for that.

506
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:24,818
Dude, she was totally into me, man!

507
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,196
-I kind of thought you were a douchebag.
-Come on.

508
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:28,655
-We need a file.
-What file?

509
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,949
89P13. Could that be something?

510
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,243
-No.
-Then your use to us...

511
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,120
-is over.
-Wait, wait, wait!

512
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,496
It sounds like a species tag.

513
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:38,832
Show us!

514
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:46,632
<i>All of our research supports the
High Evolutionary's altruistic objective...</i>

515
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,468
<i>of creating a utopian society.</i>

516
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,220
That must be the spaceport.

517
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,145
What is all this?

518
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,690
Species patented over the years
using OrgoCorp tech.

519
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:08,070
Every species OrgoCorp has created
has its own individual file.

520
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,738
I'm so sorry about this.

521
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,865
Listen to me,
this is not the kind of thing we do.

522
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:14,076
Please, stop it with the subtle jabs!

523
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,079
Old you would have never done this.
You had a purpose higher than yourself.

524
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:18,288
-A calling to help people.
-Give me a break.

525
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,040
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

526
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,251
Except, I didn't form the Guardians.

527
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,961
And I barely left Thanos.

528
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,672
Whoever it was that you were in love with...

529
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:28,924
it wasn't me.

530
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:30,926
It sounds more like her.

531
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,094
-Her?
-What?

532
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,972
-That's ridiculous! Don't even...
-Do not bring me into this.

533
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,478
-Knock it off!
-What?

534
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:44,189
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place...

535
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,607
-to lie down.
-I didn't say anything!

536
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,780
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

537
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:56,869
They were replaced by my father...

538
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:58,996
as a method of torture.

539
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:01,665
He picked a pretty set.

540
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:05,460
There.

541
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,089
That's the file for 89P13.

542
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,092
Heads up, heads up!

543
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,637
Okay.

544
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:20,726
What?

545
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,950
Oh, no.

546
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,411
Walk!

547
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:42,956
Move it, move it!

548
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,923
Stand down!

549
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,133
Drax, we should make a run for it.

550
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,301
Or we could fight.

551
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,385
-Run.
-Fight.

552
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,012
-Run!
-Fight!

553
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,055
Take 'em!

554
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:04,603
What are we gonna do?

555
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,439
-I got a plan.
-What is it?

556
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:08,607
All of you, come with me...

557
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,902
Everybody, lower your weapons...

558
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:13,570
or I blow this woman's brains out!

559
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:14,863
That's the plan?

560
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,950
-You're a kitty cat.
-Meow.

561
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,079
You feel like dancing.

562
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,582
Violent rage.

563
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,840
Lower your weapons!

564
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,930
Let's kill that one that looks like a carrot
to show we mean business.

565
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:42,558
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

566
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:45,686
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

567
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,604
We are not killing anyone!

568
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:48,772
Back off!

569
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,901
Groot, bring the <i>Bowie</i> to us.

570
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:53,902
Now.

571
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:06,540
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

572
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:07,791
Oh, please.

573
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:11,378
We're here to save the life of our friend,
that is all.

574
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,090
We paid her to help us get in and get out.

575
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,842
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you do it in a way...

576
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:18,177
"that no one knows it's happening."

577
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,679
But no, what she means is,
"I'm gonna shoot people.

578
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,472
-"Threaten people's lives."
-Shut up!

579
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:26,059
And I know you're probably asking,
why would I trust her?

580
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:28,061
Well, that's a good question.

581
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,523
The answer is, we used to be in love.

582
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,609
Yeah. She was my girlfriend...

583
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,777
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

584
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,738
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff
and she died...

585
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:40,782
and then I lost my temper
and nearly destroyed half the universe.

586
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:44,119
Then she came back, out of the past.
And there she is.

587
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,079
Everyone else who died in the past
stayed dead, not her.

588
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,415
Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know.

589
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:50,959
I'm not some
fricking Infinity Stone scientist.

590
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,464
Just some dumbass Earth dude who met a girl,
fell in love...

591
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,466
that girl died...

592
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,135
and then came back a total dick.

593
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:05,224
He left out some important information...

594
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:07,559
but that is the gist of it.

595
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,567
Get to the security hub!

596
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:16,735
Okay!

597
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:28,288
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

598
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,123
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want any...

599
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,876
No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No!

600
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:35,712
Come on! Would you please stop doing that?

601
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:02,322
Yeah!

602
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,615
Hey!

603
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:19,840
Run.

604
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,623
Drax!

605
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:58,086
Get on the ground and show me your hands now.

606
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:08,597
Ura?

607
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,474
Please listen to me.

608
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,851
We need to get out of here with this...

609
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:14,311
to save my best friend's life.

610
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:17,147
If you could get us into
the system of those sentries out there...

611
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,024
they are good people, like you.

612
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:20,359
I'm certain of it.

613
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,528
And if I just had an opportunity
to speak to them...

614
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:25,405
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen to you.

615
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,324
They will listen
if I speak to them from my heart.

616
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:29,409
Ura.

617
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,453
Please.

618
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:42,256
Hey!

619
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:47,761
Come out now!

620
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:49,096
Damn it!

621
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:57,521
You are in.

622
00:48:58,897 --> 00:48:59,898
Tell them your truth.

623
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,483
Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

624
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,110
I just needed to get into the system.

625
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:05,988
Move it.

626
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,876
Told you she was into me.

627
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:41,231
I am Groot?

628
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:44,359
Yeah, that looked cool.

629
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:55,913
Is sky?

630
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,331
No.

631
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,084
That's not sky, that's a ceiling.

632
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:05,047
But sire's making a new world
for all of us...

633
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,216
and when we get there...

634
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:09,176
there will be sky...

635
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:13,055
and it will be beautiful and forever.

636
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:14,473
Wow.

637
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,433
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

638
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,937
I have been thinking.

639
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:21,730
'Bout what?

640
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:24,191
Nothing in particular.

641
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:28,237
But I thought,
since you guys are my closest friends...

642
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,155
and my only friends...

643
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:34,743
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been thinking.

644
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,370
That's cool.

645
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,872
I've been thinking, too...

646
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,583
about something more singular.

647
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,837
When sire moves us to the new world...

648
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,839
we're gonna need names.

649
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:48,715
I mean...

650
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,759
89Q12...

651
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:52,344
it's not really a name...

652
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:57,850
so I would like my name to be...

653
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:00,185
Lylla.

654
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,104
Lylla.

655
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:03,730
Lylla.

656
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,440
Lylla.

657
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,651
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

658
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,112
Thank you.

659
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:14,575
I think my name shall be Teefs...

660
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,870
because, although we all do have them...

661
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,706
mine are definitely the most prominent.

662
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,042
-Teefs.
-Teefs.

663
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,003
-Lylla.
-Teefs.

664
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:31,341
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

665
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,553
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

666
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,347
Yes!

667
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:40,642
-Floor.
-Floor.

668
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:42,352
What about you, friend?

669
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:49,151
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly...

670
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:53,030
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together...

671
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,366
into the forever and beautiful sky.

672
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,536
Lylla, and Teefs...

673
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:02,789
and Floor, and me...

674
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,459
Rocket.

675
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:09,254
Rocket.

676
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,758
It really is good to have friends.

677
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:14,760
Yeah.

678
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,642
<i>Start the incision here.</i>

679
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:25,771
<i>Keep calm.</i>

680
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:30,651
<i>-Hold it still.
-I can't!</i>

681
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:33,403
<i>It won't stop moving.</i>

682
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,823
Why did he never tell us about any of this?

683
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,701
This is worse than what Thanos did to me.

684
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:43,705
Well, what about the passkey? Is it there?

685
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,337
No. But a file was removed today.

686
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,923
Downloaded and deleted,
a million characters in length.

687
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:57,553
The biometrics say it was this man.
Recorder B2H6.

688
00:52:57,719 --> 00:52:59,137
I saw this guy outside of records today.

689
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:03,934
Looks like one of
the High Evolutionary's recorders.

690
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,936
The High Evolutionary?

691
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,230
The founder of OrgoCorp?

692
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,190
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments...

693
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,192
that lie outside intergalactic laws.

694
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,403
He's created whole societies.

695
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,947
Xeronians, the Ani-Men...

696
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,407
-the Sovereign.
-The Sovereign?

697
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,617
Corners of the universe consider him God.

698
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:23,537
I am Groot.

699
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:24,705
Yes.

700
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:25,956
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

701
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:29,501
He said maybe this man downloaded the passkey
into the computer on his head.

702
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,130
That could store the passkey.

703
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,048
We find him, we save Rocket.

704
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,759
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

705
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,554
Put the coordinates in the nav.

706
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:41,722
Wait a minute.

707
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:43,932
Are you kidding me?

708
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:47,311
What he wants
is that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

709
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:49,271
and you're gonna bring it straight to him?

710
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,064
It's almost certainly a trap.

711
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,610
Trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

712
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:57,112
A face-off is a trap if you're facing off...

713
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:00,115
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

714
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,118
Do you know who the High Evolutionary is?

715
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:06,455
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

716
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,498
-Second best.
-The High Evolutionary...

717
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,542
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

718
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:12,544
We won't think about it when we do it.

719
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:14,630
You know what? I don't care!

720
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:15,839
Just drop me off with the Ravagers...

721
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:17,966
and you go do
whatever it is that you wanna do.

722
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,218
We don't have time for this.

723
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,929
I'm not asking you.
Drop me off with my people now!

724
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:24,932
"Your people"?
The Ravagers aren't your people.

725
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,934
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

726
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:31,021
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

727
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:32,689
But my Gamora, the one I loved...

728
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:34,149
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals...

729
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,442
she found it with us.

730
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:37,819
People who care about you.

731
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:40,239
I know that's who you still are.

732
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,741
Somewhere inside of you...

733
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:50,415
What are you so afraid of in your self
that I need to be something for you?

734
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,585
I don't give a shit about your Gamora.

735
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,128
Life made me me!

736
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:00,717
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

737
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:03,595
and we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

738
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:04,888
I'm family.

739
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,557
So is he.

740
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,271
Screw you.

741
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:16,567
Screw all of you.

742
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,706
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield...

743
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:32,958
pirating supply ships.

744
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,085
I do appreciate this, good sir.

745
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:39,256
And I appreciate your generous contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

746
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:40,674
Your associate...

747
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,887
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

748
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,305
You ain't getting nothing from me.

749
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,099
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

750
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:51,101
Adam.

751
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:53,520
Adam.

752
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:54,688
Yes, Mother?

753
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:56,148
Show him we mean business.

754
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:21,215
I said show him we mean business,
not disintegrate him!

755
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:22,799
What more business could we have shown him?

756
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:24,426
But now he's of no use to us!

757
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:25,636
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

758
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:27,429
Friend? You think that's a friend?

759
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:28,764
It's an animal!

760
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,518
He looks sad.

761
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:36,271
I really don't enjoy
how that's making me feel, actually.

762
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,150
Your friend's a moron.

763
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:42,361
I got one of those too. I get it.

764
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:44,196
<i>Outpost?</i>

765
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:45,572
<i>This is Gamora, you there?</i>

766
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:49,326
<i>Fitz-Gibbonok.</i>

767
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:50,494
Come in.

768
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:57,334
<i>Outpost, come in.</i>

769
00:56:58,335 --> 00:56:59,962
Yes, Gamora.

770
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:01,922
Salutations.

771
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,423
<i>May I help?</i>

772
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,009
Well, I need you guys to come pick me up.

773
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:08,846
<i>I'm gonna upload the location-link
to the craft I'm on.</i>

774
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:11,431
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

775
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:11,283
You need to say to him
exactly what I told you to say.

776
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,076
Why don't you just say it?

777
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:15,537
No one ever listens to me.

778
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:31,803
Quill...

779
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:33,889
life is a pond...

780
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:38,143
and you've spent your entire life
leaping from woman to woman...

781
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,521
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

782
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:43,524
Perhaps, what you need to do, Quill...

783
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:46,527
is learn to swim.

784
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,365
That actually made sense.

785
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:52,491
Yes, it made sense.

786
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,868
No, I mean, that's sort of an analogy.

787
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,830
And I didn't know that you were capable
of that type of thought.

788
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:00,541
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

789
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,210
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

790
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,462
For instance...

791
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:10,259
Gamora's head is like a lily pad
because it is green.

792
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:12,928
Analogy.

793
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,013
And also stupid-looking...

794
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,431
-and flappy.
-Flappy?

795
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:19,059
Because her skin is made of a leaf.

796
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:20,519
Metaphor.

797
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:21,979
Is it?

798
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:25,315
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

799
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:29,278
Even my butt is capable of making an analogy.

800
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:40,414
What's happening?

801
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,833
The fluid is in his lungs.

802
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:45,502
P13?

803
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:48,213
P13.

804
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,091
Sire.

805
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,427
P13!

806
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:56,013
-My lord, might I suggest that we...
-Where is it? I passed it.

807
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,681
Must...

808
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:03,437
Sire was in the middle of his treatments
when we had a breakthrough with Batch 92.

809
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:05,397
Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow, yes?

810
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,482
"We shall resume tomorrow," no!

811
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:08,901
P13!

812
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:13,197
There you are.

813
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:24,249
Hello.

814
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:36,345
How did you know...

815
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:40,474
about the microseminoproteins, P13?

816
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,208
What happened in there?

817
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,126
Why?

818
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:11,380
How did you know, P13?

819
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:13,465
It was too little filtration...

820
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:16,176
In the hypotonic, yes, we know,
we fixed that.

821
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:17,970
But how did you know?

822
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:21,014
I made you!

823
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:23,350
How did you know?

824
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:28,647
Because it worked.

825
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:37,072
It worked.

826
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,910
Their rage is gone.

827
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:45,539
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought...

828
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:48,292
ready to inhabit the new world.

829
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,880
We're going to the new world?

830
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,466
We?

831
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:00,262
Look at you.

832
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:01,722
As if you were...

833
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:04,516
cobbled together by fat-fingered children.

834
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:07,603
How could you be part of a perfect species?

835
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:11,773
You're simply a medley of mistakes
we could learn from...

836
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,610
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

837
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:21,158
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

838
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:22,826
You could figure out...

839
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:26,705
the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems...

840
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:28,749
but you couldn't figure out that?

841
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:34,296
But that brain.

842
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,674
That, I'd like to study further.

843
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:45,516
Prep it for surgery and removal
in the morning.

844
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,477
What about the rest of Batch 89, sire?

845
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:53,649
Incinerate them.

846
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:04,117
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

847
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:06,286
We don't have long.

848
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,081
<i>We've arrived.</i>

849
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,722
That looks just like...

850
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:27,975
home.

851
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,406
It's like a replica of Earth.

852
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:43,782
It makes no sense.

853
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:46,994
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

854
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,631
Hello.

855
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:43,217
We mean you no harm.

856
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:56,522
Listen to me, he was just trying
to throw her back her ball.

857
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:00,442
Hey!

858
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:03,529
Come on! There's no reason...

859
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:06,323
Hey, hey.

860
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:08,242
Groot, full Kaiju!

861
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:10,827
-Not full Kaiju!
-I am...

862
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:12,204
-Groot!
-Back up.

863
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:13,747
No, not Kaiju!

864
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:15,082
Groot, down!

865
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:16,834
There's no reason to be afraid.

866
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,838
Get down, Groot!

867
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:22,881
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

868
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,091
Hey. Hey, hi.

869
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:25,926
We're not here to harm you.

870
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:27,845
Okay.

871
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,805
See? Here.

872
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,182
For your knee.

873
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,186
We just need to save our friend.

874
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:43,235
Filthy. It doesn't belong here.

875
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:47,072
I will train it in the ways of the Sovereign.

876
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:51,326
I will train him not to do that.

877
01:05:51,493 --> 01:05:53,829
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

878
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,290
Kill it. Now.

879
01:05:56,999 --> 01:06:00,836
I am the Warlock, Mum,
and I am done with being ordered around.

880
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:03,380
Gamora is here.

881
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:07,259
Which means the squirrel is also.

882
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:09,553
To save ourselves,
we must bring it to the High Evolutionary...

883
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,471
before his own people do.

884
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,039
Yeah, yeah, sit.

885
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:38,874
Let's sit. Okay.

886
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:49,718
I am Groot.

887
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,678
It's not rude. It's what it's here for.

888
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,180
Drax, sit up!

889
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,348
Idiot.

890
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:57,518
Thank you.

891
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,065
Thank you.

892
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:06,568
Our friend...

893
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,071
He's dying.

894
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,330
We love our friend.

895
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:21,250
But he is dying.

896
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:26,421
That's not dying, that's already dead.

897
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:27,965
They'll think he's already dead.

898
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,050
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

899
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,885
Drax, sit up.

900
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,053
That's what it's here for!

901
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,304
Drax, it isn't.

902
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:36,014
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder...

903
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,100
right next to each other.
Get your boots off her pillows.

904
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:40,727
I find it hard to believe
it doesn't have multiple purposes!

905
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:42,187
I'm sorry. My friend...

906
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:43,605
is a dumbass.

907
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,316
That's the same as your dying.

908
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,151
Why do you criticize everything?

909
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:49,570
Well, why is it oblong then?

910
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:50,988
It was a totally different sound.

911
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:54,116
No, it wasn't. Dying. Dumbass. See?
It's the same.

912
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:55,325
All right, guys!

913
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,953
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

914
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,496
Drax, I see you!

915
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:05,252
I understand that none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

916
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:07,921
We need your help...

917
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,716
in finding a man.

918
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:12,926
I'm gonna draw.

919
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:15,262
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

920
01:08:17,221 --> 01:08:18,682
Like this.

921
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:20,893
You see the thing on her head?

922
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:24,438
-He has a thing like this.
-That is delightful.

923
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:26,064
There you go.

924
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:29,318
Have you seen this man?

925
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:32,487
That's very good.

926
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:34,698
Can I have that later
to hang in my apartment, please?

927
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:36,658
Yeah.
Thank you.

928
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,037
His name is <i>"Mowtio"?</i>

929
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,099
Many <i>mowtios.</i> There?

930
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:03,435
At the pyramid.

931
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:08,814
Is that your car in the driveway?

932
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:16,782
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

933
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:18,075
Watch him. That's who they're coming for.

934
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:19,493
-I wanna come.
-No.

935
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,537
Mantis, watch Drax.

936
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:23,872
Groot, you know what to do with these.

937
01:09:31,587 --> 01:09:33,298
-Push down on it.
-What?

938
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:35,509
-Push it down.
-I am pushing down on it.

939
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:36,468
Push the button.

940
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:39,763
-It looks like you're pushing the keyhole.
-The what?

941
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:43,015
There's a button under the handle,
press that in.

942
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:45,935
Okay. Now what?

943
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:47,563
Open the fucking door.

944
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:51,692
That is a stupid design...

945
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:54,653
and your instructions were very unclear.

946
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,531
Let's get that passkey and save our friend.

947
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:05,622
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

948
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:07,916
Why would I know any more about
driving one of these things than you do?

949
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,001
Don't see you volunteering.

950
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,169
-You want me to drive?
-No.

951
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:11,712
-I'll drive.
-I don't want you to drive.

952
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:12,796
I got this.

953
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:00,302
You must be a really loyal pet...

954
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:03,764
if they're willing to do all this for you.

955
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:14,877
This is the perfect society?

956
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:36,523
Sire.

957
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,817
This one has been running for two hours...

958
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:40,527
without breaking a sweat.

959
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,196
-It's incredible...
-They can survive...

960
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,572
on thirty calories a day...

961
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:46,575
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy...

962
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:48,744
and they can rewire a carbenetrix core...

963
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,829
in under two minutes.

964
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,916
But will she be ready for the new colony?

965
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,543
Sire, they're here.

966
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,259
Here we go.

967
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:13,310
We're here to see...

968
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:15,979
The High Evolutionary is expecting you.

969
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,231
Which means it is a trap.

970
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:18,440
It's a face-off.

971
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:20,859
-She stays here.
-Why?

972
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:22,110
Policy against weaponry...

973
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:23,695
and your arm is a gun.

974
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,494
-He's clean.
-Let's go.

975
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,120
Hey.

976
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,706
It'll be okay.

977
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:56,895
Move it!

978
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:17,583
Are you okay, Rocket?

979
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,144
Me Rocket play now?

980
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:38,312
I can't right now, Floor.

981
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:47,029
What are you doing?

982
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:48,822
They ain't gonna set us free.

983
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:50,866
Yes, they are, Rocket.

984
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:52,951
We're going to the new world any day now.

985
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:57,831
No, that can't be true.

986
01:14:57,998 --> 01:14:58,999
It is.

987
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,502
They wanna kill us all in the morning.

988
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:02,503
What?

989
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:03,879
What?

990
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:05,380
But I'm gonna fix it.

991
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,346
What is that?

992
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:13,931
It's a key.

993
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:16,808
I'm gonna use it to get us all out of here.

994
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,895
I don't know if that's wise, Rocket.

995
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,147
Me Rocket leave!

996
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:24,691
Hooray time forever!

997
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:28,362
Just down that hall, there are ships.

998
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,740
I know. And if we can get to one...

999
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,116
I can pilot it.

1000
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:36,828
And then we'll all fly away together,
the four of us...

1001
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,248
just like we always said, okay?

1002
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,085
Okay?

1003
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:51,134
Yippee! Rocket! Sky, sky, sky!

1004
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,784
-You did it!
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

1005
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:16,910
You did it!

1006
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,204
You did it, you did it, you did it!

1007
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,101
You did it!

1008
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:43,395
You did it.

1009
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:46,565
It really is good to have...

1010
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:06,793
Yes, I imagined you'd do something like this.

1011
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:09,505
Back in the cage, P13.

1012
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:17,012
Sky.

1013
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:34,488
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1014
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:38,158
-Q12 and P13 escaped from their pens.
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1015
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,410
-Q12 is neutralized...
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1016
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:42,538
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
-...but P13 is still out...

1017
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:45,457
-so I'll need assistance.
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1018
01:17:45,624 --> 01:17:47,751
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1019
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:50,003
Remember not to bruise its brain.

1020
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:59,221
All right, P13!

1021
01:17:59,388 --> 01:18:02,349
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1022
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:06,562
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1023
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:08,146
-Rocket, let's go!
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1024
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:10,148
-Let's go! Rocket, please!
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1025
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:11,358
Rocket!

1026
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:13,026
Rocket!

1027
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,738
Down here. Hurry.

1028
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:15,839
-Hey, there it is!
-Get him!

1029
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:18,133
-Get back here!
-Get it!

1030
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:04,638
What are you doing?

1031
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,098
I got a bad feeling about this.

1032
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,100
Peter just told you to stay here.

1033
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:09,268
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1034
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:12,604
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

1035
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,565
We need to protect Rocket.

1036
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:16,149
Yeah, that's right.

1037
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,444
So, hop on and we'll ride back to the ship.

1038
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:21,280
Just right over there?

1039
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:22,906
Yeah.

1040
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,420
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1041
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:46,555
You!

1042
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:48,348
Hey, yeah, you!

1043
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,227
I take it the passkey,
it's in that thing on your head.

1044
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,855
I would advise against aggression.

1045
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,566
Got time for me now?

1046
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:01,236
Your friend once took advantage.

1047
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,155
I learn my lessons.

1048
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:07,242
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity...

1049
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:09,119
back in my own direction...

1050
01:21:09,286 --> 01:21:12,372
and now, gravity itself serves my whims.

1051
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:14,875
War Pig.

1052
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,168
<i>Now.</i>

1053
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,757
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

1054
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:22,925
Counter-Earth?

1055
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,135
I visited your planet many years ago.

1056
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:26,970
Earth hasn't been my planet in a long time.

1057
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,263
Your people had...

1058
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:30,224
wonderful spirit.

1059
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:35,229
The art and music and literature
were some of the finest in the universe.

1060
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:40,609
Earth would be a fabulous place,
were it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

1061
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:42,778
-Okay.
-It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

1062
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,446
I don't care.

1063
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,114
All of the good and none of the bad.

1064
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:49,243
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob...

1065
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:50,661
whose mother didn't love him...

1066
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:53,288
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1067
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:56,250
I'm not trying to conquer the universe...

1068
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,001
I'm perfecting it.

1069
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,509
What the...

1070
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:25,863
Hey!

1071
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,823
Drop the badger.

1072
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:36,039
-I just want the passkey.
-Then bring me 89P13.

1073
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:37,457
I am Groot.

1074
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:39,877
He says, "Suck my..."

1075
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:41,253
Why are you so angry?

1076
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:43,213
Because I know what you did to our friend.

1077
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:47,050
Anything I've done,
I've done for the betterment of the universe.

1078
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:48,594
Newsflash, Einstein.

1079
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,722
Better universes generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth...

1080
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:53,640
to guys with cockroach heads.

1081
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:56,018
They do not.

1082
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,521
Which is why...

1083
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,857
as I have done many times before...

1084
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:04,151
I'm going to have to raze it all...

1085
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:05,986
and start again.

1086
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:07,196
What?

1087
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:17,623
I got 89P13...

1088
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:19,166
<i>and I'm on my way.</i>

1089
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:20,709
We're in possession of the subject.

1090
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:48,654
Oh, my God.

1091
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:00,374
I am Groot?

1092
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:01,625
Kill 'em all.

1093
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:05,754
Stay.

1094
01:24:08,131 --> 01:24:09,174
I said "stay."

1095
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:13,053
What, did you want me to leave you back,
so that Mother could fillet you?

1096
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:15,347
Stay.

1097
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:16,515
What the hell?

1098
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:19,393
-We're working for the same boss.
-Yes...

1099
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:21,144
but I need the credit, chum...

1100
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:23,188
to save my entire civilization.

1101
01:24:24,147 --> 01:24:27,234
So be a good creepy thing...

1102
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:28,235
and back off.

1103
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:38,912
No.

1104
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:20,621
Mother.

1105
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:46,730
Mother!

1106
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:52,945
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1107
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:55,113
Mantis?
Drax?

1108
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:56,823
<i>Hey.</i>

1109
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,201
I need you to bring the ship here now!

1110
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:03,664
<i>Well, we can't do that exactly
because we're not at the ship.</i>

1111
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,915
Then where the hell are...

1112
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:34,736
Nebula, come in.

1113
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:38,740
Gamora! Take off now!
Get yourself and Rocket off the planet.

1114
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:45,622
What kinda ship is this?

1115
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,586
It's amusing, really.

1116
01:26:50,752 --> 01:26:52,129
How stupid are you, hmm?

1117
01:26:52,296 --> 01:26:54,006
It was so obviously a trap.

1118
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:57,050
It's not a trap. It's a face-off.

1119
01:26:57,634 --> 01:26:59,303
Now kill them all.

1120
01:27:00,721 --> 01:27:01,763
What do you have in your hand?

1121
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:06,935
Grenade!

1122
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:48,435
I am Groot!

1123
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:21,552
No! Don't!

1124
01:28:21,844 --> 01:28:24,972
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1125
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:26,932
Please, spare me, please.

1126
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:33,397
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1127
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:34,773
That'd be premature.

1128
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:37,359
No, no, no...

1129
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:52,749
Quite a novel escape plan,
jumping headfirst into an exploding planet.

1130
01:28:57,838 --> 01:28:59,506
You'll kill us both!

1131
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:01,049
Not both.

1132
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:18,192
Why are we doing this?

1133
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,777
Quill and Groot are inside.
We have to get them out.

1134
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:50,682
Groot.

1135
01:30:07,533 --> 01:30:09,535
Whoever's in the cockpit, activate the brake.

1136
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:11,453
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1137
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,121
Well, pull harder!

1138
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:20,045
Let's go. Come on.

1139
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:42,067
It's hard to breathe.

1140
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:51,910
We're entering space.

1141
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,646
Oh, piss off.

1142
01:31:28,655 --> 01:31:31,491
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1143
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:32,993
Where are Mantis and Drax?

1144
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,161
I don't know!

1145
01:31:38,457 --> 01:31:39,625
-Gimme.
-Here.

1146
01:31:42,002 --> 01:31:43,045
You're lucky I was able to...

1147
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:45,339
-knock down that door...
-Rocket and Gamora are probably dead...

1148
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:46,507
because of you!

1149
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:48,509
-I didn't know.
-Oh, you didn't know?

1150
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:50,344
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse of...

1151
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:53,180
being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing...

1152
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:55,516
and the rest of us having to
carry your slack!

1153
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:56,892
Don't push him!

1154
01:31:57,059 --> 01:31:58,185
You don't have the right to push him.

1155
01:31:58,352 --> 01:32:00,062
And you! You're no better.

1156
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:01,939
The only thing we can count on you for...

1157
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:05,025
is when someone shows weakness,
you'll be right there to support it.

1158
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:06,485
Fine, I don't care.

1159
01:32:06,652 --> 01:32:10,364
I know you need to find fault in
everyone else to make yourself feel okay...

1160
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,991
-so find it in me.
-Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1161
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:14,952
But you don't have the right to push him!

1162
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:17,329
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1163
01:32:17,704 --> 01:32:18,539
He's a liability.

1164
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:22,751
He makes us laugh and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1165
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:26,922
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1166
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:29,049
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1167
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:30,551
He has sadness...

1168
01:32:30,717 --> 01:32:33,470
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1169
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:35,848
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1170
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:38,100
You think I'm stupid?

1171
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:40,477
Yes.

1172
01:32:44,064 --> 01:32:45,065
Forget.

1173
01:32:48,277 --> 01:32:51,446
You're lucky I was able to knock down
that door with my incredible strength.

1174
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:53,699
Quill?

1175
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:55,742
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1176
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:02,249
That language isn't in my translator.

1177
01:33:12,885 --> 01:33:15,053
Okay. Here we go.

1178
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:37,910
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1179
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:39,745
Go.

1180
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,472
Lylla?

1181
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:02,392
Friend.

1182
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:06,980
Okay, okay.

1183
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:08,148
Okay, here we go.

1184
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:12,986
This isn't right.

1185
01:34:13,862 --> 01:34:16,240
Yeah, no, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1186
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:17,616
It needs to be faster.

1187
01:34:20,244 --> 01:34:22,913
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1188
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:26,124
Rocket.

1189
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:27,584
I let you down.

1190
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,089
I got you killed.
I got everybody killed.

1191
01:34:32,589 --> 01:34:33,966
We were right.

1192
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:38,262
The sky is beautiful, and it is forever.

1193
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:41,682
And I've been flying with our friends.

1194
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:56,363
Can I come?

1195
01:34:56,905 --> 01:34:58,115
Yes.

1196
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:08,709
No, no, no!

1197
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:10,210
No!

1198
01:35:10,377 --> 01:35:11,378
Come on.

1199
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:13,630
-Come on!
-Quill.

1200
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:17,968
No!

1201
01:35:18,135 --> 01:35:20,429
No!

1202
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:23,682
-Quill.
-No!

1203
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:25,976
-Quill.
-I'm not gonna lose him.

1204
01:35:26,143 --> 01:35:27,144
He's gone.

1205
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:30,022
I'm not letting him go!

1206
01:35:32,441 --> 01:35:33,442
Come on.

1207
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:47,539
But not yet.

1208
01:35:48,665 --> 01:35:50,542
You still have a purpose here.

1209
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:53,003
A purpose for what?

1210
01:35:53,504 --> 01:35:54,963
They made us for nothing.

1211
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,716
Stupid experiments to be thrown away.

1212
01:35:58,884 --> 01:36:00,844
There are the hands that made us...

1213
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:04,014
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1214
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:13,357
My beloved raccoon.

1215
01:36:14,358 --> 01:36:17,903
This story has been yours all along,
you just didn't know it.

1216
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:23,075
I'm not a raccoon.

1217
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:32,209
The passkey's going through!

1218
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:50,811
Quill?

1219
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:11,582
Where's Nebula?

1220
01:37:17,546 --> 01:37:19,047
She's...

1221
01:37:19,965 --> 01:37:22,259
Because her code is on the comm behind you.

1222
01:37:27,723 --> 01:37:28,974
What?
Nebula?

1223
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:31,018
-Where are you?
-Thank God!

1224
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:32,394
We're here to get you out of here.

1225
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:34,104
-Out of where?
<i>-The High Evolutionary's ship.</i>

1226
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:35,731
No, I got off the ship.

1227
01:37:35,898 --> 01:37:37,149
-You what?
<i>-Wait, where are you?</i>

1228
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:38,317
On the ship!

1229
01:37:38,483 --> 01:37:39,818
-On the ship?
<i>-I didn't lie.</i>

1230
01:37:39,985 --> 01:37:41,236
Why are you on the ship?

1231
01:37:41,403 --> 01:37:42,613
To save you, obviously.

1232
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:43,780
<i>No, I told you to go back.</i>

1233
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:47,451
You gotta know by now I always figure out
an incredibly clever way to get out of a fix.

1234
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:48,702
Tell him I said hi.

1235
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:51,038
-Really?
-Tell him we're coming to save him.

1236
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:52,915
Pay attention or play with the kids.

1237
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:54,166
<i>One or the other.</i>

1238
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:55,375
"Play with the kids"?

1239
01:37:55,542 --> 01:37:56,710
How did you get out?

1240
01:37:56,877 --> 01:37:57,836
That's not really important.

1241
01:37:58,003 --> 01:37:59,254
I am Groot.

1242
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,798
Jumping a thousand feet to your death
without a parachute...

1243
01:38:01,965 --> 01:38:02,925
is a clever way...

1244
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:04,635
<i>of getting out of a fix?</i>

1245
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:06,970
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1246
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:08,555
The important thing is...

1247
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:10,140
<i>we're all okay.</i>

1248
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:14,394
Rocket?

1249
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:16,897
Yeah, he's here.

1250
01:38:17,064 --> 01:38:18,190
And he's okay.

1251
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:28,534
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1252
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:30,661
Well, that makes you the idiots then.

1253
01:38:30,827 --> 01:38:31,954
<i>He's right about that.</i>

1254
01:38:34,248 --> 01:38:35,499
Back in your cages!

1255
01:38:39,878 --> 01:38:40,879
Nebula?

1256
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,507
Nebula, come in!

1257
01:38:48,971 --> 01:38:51,932
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1258
01:38:53,934 --> 01:38:54,935
Go to hell...

1259
01:38:55,102 --> 01:38:56,436
you sick son of a bitch.

1260
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,063
<i>You killed all of those people.</i>

1261
01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:00,065
As I will your friends.

1262
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:02,693
<i>I'm sending you the coordinates.</i>

1263
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:05,362
They will die unless you bring me...

1264
01:39:05,529 --> 01:39:06,530
<i>what is mine!</i>

1265
01:39:06,697 --> 01:39:10,617
Screw you,
you stretch-faced, RoboCop-looking...

1266
01:39:10,784 --> 01:39:12,160
Skeletor wannabe...

1267
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:14,329
purple-nurple piece of...

1268
01:39:17,499 --> 01:39:18,584
He hung up.

1269
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:22,504
You think?

1270
01:39:25,799 --> 01:39:27,342
1966.

1271
01:39:27,509 --> 01:39:30,095
The Soviet put me on a rocket...

1272
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:33,223
knowing full well I'm never to return
and I will die...

1273
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:35,184
in a fiery ball of death.

1274
01:39:35,684 --> 01:39:38,395
But one thing even <i>mudak</i> Soviets never do...

1275
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:40,689
is call me bad dog.

1276
01:39:40,856 --> 01:39:43,192
Oh, my God! Could you just let it go?

1277
01:39:43,358 --> 01:39:47,362
Kraglin, please, just take it back.
This is killing us.

1278
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:50,324
I can't take it back if she is, in fact...

1279
01:39:50,824 --> 01:39:51,825
a bad dog.

1280
01:39:52,868 --> 01:39:55,370
-Kraglin!
-It never stops hurting.

1281
01:39:55,787 --> 01:39:56,997
<i>Kraglin.</i>

1282
01:39:57,664 --> 01:39:58,749
Oh, hey, Pete.

1283
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:02,544
We need to save Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,
and we need your help.

1284
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:03,879
Me?

1285
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:09,092
You're the one who lost it, you twit.

1286
01:40:09,259 --> 01:40:11,303
The Hellspawn had it, sire, but...

1287
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:12,429
But, but, but!

1288
01:40:12,596 --> 01:40:13,847
But!

1289
01:40:15,766 --> 01:40:17,518
That rancid word.

1290
01:40:20,646 --> 01:40:23,190
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser...

1291
01:40:23,357 --> 01:40:26,360
to go directly to the new colony
and not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1292
01:40:26,527 --> 01:40:30,280
They can rewire a carbenetrix core
in under two minutes...

1293
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:31,698
but what is that, Vim?

1294
01:40:32,533 --> 01:40:33,534
Rote memorization.

1295
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,452
Rote memorization!

1296
01:40:36,411 --> 01:40:38,247
In hundreds of years of our creations...

1297
01:40:38,413 --> 01:40:41,500
only one has known true invention.

1298
01:40:41,667 --> 01:40:42,668
One.

1299
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:49,383
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1300
01:40:52,261 --> 01:40:53,303
Yes, sire.

1301
01:40:54,304 --> 01:40:58,517
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought...

1302
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:00,227
will die on the vine.

1303
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:03,689
We need 89P13's brain...

1304
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:07,234
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures...

1305
01:41:07,401 --> 01:41:09,319
before we go to the new colony.

1306
01:41:09,486 --> 01:41:11,530
Nothing else matters.

1307
01:41:31,633 --> 01:41:33,093
How did they get down here?

1308
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:38,265
Peter will be trying to get to the spaceport.

1309
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:40,392
He doesn't know about the children.

1310
01:41:40,934 --> 01:41:41,935
You!

1311
01:41:43,145 --> 01:41:45,647
We need you to let all the other children
on board know...

1312
01:41:45,814 --> 01:41:47,441
to stay away from the starboard walls.

1313
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,361
They know three frickin' words...

1314
01:41:51,528 --> 01:41:52,946
and two of them are <i>"joob."</i>

1315
01:41:54,198 --> 01:41:56,158
No! Listen to me!

1316
01:41:56,867 --> 01:41:59,161
You need to talk to the other children...

1317
01:41:59,328 --> 01:42:01,955
all of them here, and tell them...

1318
01:42:02,122 --> 01:42:04,082
to stay away from the freaking...

1319
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:05,751
What the hell are you doing, Mantis?

1320
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:08,504
Explaining it, dickhead!

1321
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:20,891
You're scaring them.

1322
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:28,315
Hello, dumb idiots.

1323
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:34,196
I had a little girl like you.

1324
01:42:34,905 --> 01:42:36,615
You know what she used to like?

1325
01:42:37,032 --> 01:42:39,034
She liked when I made monkey noises.

1326
01:42:49,711 --> 01:42:51,046
How is that a monkey?

1327
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,257
Beats me.

1328
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:29,877
Yeah.

1329
01:43:31,128 --> 01:43:32,212
Yeah.

1330
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,050
They're gonna tell the other kids
to stay away from the starboard wall.

1331
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:40,095
Why didn't you tell us
you knew their language this whole time?

1332
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:41,930
Why didn't you ask?

1333
01:43:44,391 --> 01:43:47,936
This could be futile, Quill.
He's too powerful.

1334
01:43:48,103 --> 01:43:49,813
Well, then I guess we'll die trying.

1335
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,482
What is "dying trying" gonna accomplish?

1336
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:54,109
Or we can just give him the badger?

1337
01:43:54,276 --> 01:43:56,820
Our thing is dying trying.

1338
01:43:56,987 --> 01:43:57,988
I am Groot.

1339
01:43:58,155 --> 01:43:59,740
I know who you are already!

1340
01:44:00,324 --> 01:44:02,534
Feel free to stay behind in the cargo area.

1341
01:44:02,701 --> 01:44:05,579
I'm not leaving my sister with that jackass.

1342
01:44:05,746 --> 01:44:06,955
This you?

1343
01:44:07,122 --> 01:44:08,665
Fell out of your bag.

1344
01:44:10,792 --> 01:44:12,002
Let's do this.

1345
01:44:48,956 --> 01:44:50,290
Wait.

1346
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,001
Wait.

1347
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:56,547
<i>Reading some old letters
You smile...</i>

1348
01:44:59,216 --> 01:45:01,426
You almost have to admire their pluck.

1349
01:45:02,553 --> 01:45:03,554
Sire.

1350
01:45:14,523 --> 01:45:16,608
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1351
01:45:21,154 --> 01:45:22,906
-Back up!
-Yes, sire.

1352
01:45:25,367 --> 01:45:26,702
You're on, Steemie.

1353
01:45:27,578 --> 01:45:28,662
First barrel.

1354
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:31,832
Second barrel.

1355
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:34,251
Third barrel.

1356
01:45:34,418 --> 01:45:35,586
Fourth barrel.

1357
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:45,679
Hard starboard.

1358
01:45:45,846 --> 01:45:46,847
Hard starboard.

1359
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,646
And fire!

1360
01:46:03,071 --> 01:46:04,281
They've breached the spaceport.

1361
01:46:04,448 --> 01:46:06,909
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1362
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:08,619
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1363
01:46:08,785 --> 01:46:11,580
Sire, the Hellspawn were created
solely to defend the new colony...

1364
01:46:11,747 --> 01:46:13,165
Do it now!

1365
01:46:13,332 --> 01:46:14,833
Get me 89P13...

1366
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,253
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1367
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,126
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n...

1368
01:46:58,293 --> 01:46:59,878
<i>but that old missile's all we had.</i>

1369
01:47:00,045 --> 01:47:03,465
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1370
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:18,480
What the hell?

1371
01:47:33,078 --> 01:47:34,955
Aw, come on!

1372
01:48:04,568 --> 01:48:06,862
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated.

1373
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:10,490
Open the pit.

1374
01:48:10,657 --> 01:48:13,285
Sire, our bargaining power will be gone.

1375
01:48:38,477 --> 01:48:39,478
Abilisks!

1376
01:48:47,236 --> 01:48:48,445
Good God!

1377
01:48:54,993 --> 01:48:56,078
This way!

1378
01:50:02,019 --> 01:50:03,979
One more step and this weird thing gets it!

1379
01:50:04,146 --> 01:50:04,980
Don't be rash.

1380
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:25,417
What were you programming?

1381
01:50:25,584 --> 01:50:26,835
A self-destruction code.

1382
01:50:44,853 --> 01:50:46,063
What are you doing?

1383
01:50:49,358 --> 01:50:50,359
It's okay.

1384
01:50:50,526 --> 01:50:51,693
Mantis, stop!

1385
01:50:54,071 --> 01:50:55,197
They eat batteries...

1386
01:50:55,364 --> 01:50:56,615
not people.

1387
01:50:58,116 --> 01:51:01,578
Maybe they're just scared
of what we are gonna do to them.

1388
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:10,128
We're not gonna hurt you.

1389
01:51:13,215 --> 01:51:15,217
Everything is going to be okay.

1390
01:52:10,856 --> 01:52:12,191
Use your heart, boy.

1391
01:53:03,575 --> 01:53:04,618
A dog!

1392
01:53:04,785 --> 01:53:05,994
Yeah.

1393
01:53:14,378 --> 01:53:16,380
She's a good dog.

1394
01:53:20,759 --> 01:53:22,886
I knew you believe I am good dog.

1395
01:53:23,053 --> 01:53:24,888
All right, all right, get off me, you idiot!

1396
01:53:28,809 --> 01:53:31,520
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1397
01:53:31,687 --> 01:53:33,272
The spaceport has intruders.

1398
01:53:33,564 --> 01:53:36,233
Go! See if one of them is 89P13.

1399
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,485
Sire, you have an irrational obsession
with this animal.

1400
01:53:38,652 --> 01:53:39,945
You must stop, for God's sake!

1401
01:53:40,112 --> 01:53:41,822
There is no God!

1402
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:44,157
That's why I stepped in!

1403
01:54:12,728 --> 01:54:17,065
Controller, I am taking command of the <i>Arête.</i>

1404
01:54:17,232 --> 01:54:21,653
Disengage all damaged sectors of the ship...

1405
01:54:22,029 --> 01:54:23,906
and retreat.

1406
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:50,140
Attention...

1407
01:54:50,307 --> 01:54:51,642
<i>all personnel.</i>

1408
01:54:52,935 --> 01:54:55,979
<i>Intruders have boarded the ship.</i>

1409
01:54:56,605 --> 01:54:59,107
<i>Head to the starboard spaceport.</i>

1410
01:55:01,568 --> 01:55:03,987
<i>Get me 89P13...</i>

1411
01:55:05,197 --> 01:55:06,657
and kill the rest.

1412
01:55:16,124 --> 01:55:17,626
We go in there, we get Mantis...

1413
01:55:17,793 --> 01:55:19,169
Nebula, and Drax.

1414
01:55:19,336 --> 01:55:22,214
We move in, we get 'em, and we get out.

1415
01:55:41,733 --> 01:55:43,110
Did that look cool?

1416
01:55:43,819 --> 01:55:47,531
Okay, new game plan.
We get the hell out of here now.

1417
01:55:47,698 --> 01:55:49,116
There are thousands of creatures on the ship.

1418
01:55:49,283 --> 01:55:50,659
Many of them are children.

1419
01:55:50,826 --> 01:55:52,119
And we need to be good <i>joob joob.</i>

1420
01:55:53,787 --> 01:55:54,997
It means friends.

1421
01:55:55,914 --> 01:55:58,333
If we wanna live, we have to leave now.

1422
01:55:58,876 --> 01:56:01,211
This whole rig is gonna go down any second.

1423
01:56:01,378 --> 01:56:03,714
They will all die if we don't help them.

1424
01:56:11,013 --> 01:56:12,806
I'm done runnin'.

1425
01:59:15,948 --> 01:59:17,407
There's a big hole up in the deck.

1426
01:59:17,574 --> 01:59:20,577
If we can connect that to Knowhere,
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1427
01:59:20,744 --> 01:59:24,706
Nebs and me will pilot the ship.
You guys save all the higher life forms.

1428
01:59:35,217 --> 01:59:36,218
Hello, moron.

1429
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:40,347
Come on!

1430
01:59:42,266 --> 01:59:43,725
Follow me, come on! Come on!

1431
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:46,103
Come on!

1432
01:59:47,187 --> 01:59:48,730
Go, go, go!

1433
01:59:50,482 --> 01:59:51,608
I am Groot!

1434
02:00:09,585 --> 02:00:11,044
This way to...

1435
02:00:11,837 --> 02:00:13,213
Thank you.

1436
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:15,507
Yes, you're welcome. I was screaming at...

1437
02:00:15,674 --> 02:00:17,134
something scary behind you, not you.

1438
02:00:17,301 --> 02:00:19,636
You look really cool.

1439
02:00:24,558 --> 02:00:26,685
Kill me if you want,
but then good luck gettin' out of here.

1440
02:00:31,064 --> 02:00:32,065
-Wait!
-Let him go, Flecktick...

1441
02:00:32,232 --> 02:00:33,150
it's our only chance.

1442
02:00:33,317 --> 02:00:34,484
I got a space big enough to get through.

1443
02:00:34,651 --> 02:00:37,487
I gotta find out if I can change it
to a permeable shield.

1444
02:00:43,869 --> 02:00:45,245
I can't fly this frickin' thing...

1445
02:00:45,412 --> 02:00:47,164
the flight controls are all screwed.

1446
02:00:47,331 --> 02:00:48,457
I'll do it.

1447
02:00:48,624 --> 02:00:50,709
Go help the others. Wait, give me your comm.

1448
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,720
<i>Kraglin, I'll pilot from this side.</i>

1449
02:01:02,638 --> 02:01:03,639
Kragula...

1450
02:01:03,805 --> 02:01:05,766
<i>back in action!</i>

1451
02:01:31,917 --> 02:01:33,335
Come on, come on, come on!

1452
02:01:33,502 --> 02:01:34,503
Go, go!

1453
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:36,046
Go, go, go!

1454
02:01:37,464 --> 02:01:38,465
Wait, wait, wait!

1455
02:01:38,632 --> 02:01:39,758
Stop, stop!

1456
02:01:39,925 --> 02:01:41,552
Are those kids?

1457
02:01:58,318 --> 02:01:59,778
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up!

1458
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:02,239
<i>It needs to be airtight
for the kids to make it across.</i>

1459
02:02:02,406 --> 02:02:04,116
Locking up, <i>Kapitan.</i>

1460
02:02:13,083 --> 02:02:14,710
Go, now, go!

1461
02:02:19,256 --> 02:02:21,133
One by one, one by one!

1462
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:22,593
Okay.

1463
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:30,976
Locking in and headed down.

1464
02:02:37,274 --> 02:02:39,026
This way. This way.

1465
02:02:42,738 --> 02:02:43,739
Why?

1466
02:02:45,824 --> 02:02:48,118
Why are you doing this? I tried to kill you.

1467
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:51,163
I am Groot.

1468
02:02:51,997 --> 02:02:53,081
He says...

1469
02:02:53,248 --> 02:02:55,292
"everyone deserves a second chance."

1470
02:03:06,386 --> 02:03:08,639
You are so strong.

1471
02:03:13,352 --> 02:03:15,479
Why are you so slow? Hurry!

1472
02:03:16,647 --> 02:03:17,898
Where's Rocket?

1473
02:05:47,464 --> 02:05:48,465
You!

1474
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:52,010
You thought you could escape me!

1475
02:05:52,845 --> 02:05:53,846
No!

1476
02:05:56,139 --> 02:05:59,893
You think you have some worth
in and of yourself, without me?

1477
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,061
No!

1478
02:06:02,896 --> 02:06:04,439
You are an abomination!

1479
02:06:04,606 --> 02:06:07,776
Nothing more than a step on my path...

1480
02:06:07,943 --> 02:06:10,237
you freakish little monster!

1481
02:06:10,404 --> 02:06:12,489
How dare you think you are more...

1482
02:06:13,532 --> 02:06:17,119
89P13?

1483
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:21,790
The name's Rocket.

1484
02:06:22,708 --> 02:06:25,085
Rocket Raccoon.

1485
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,376
His face came off!

1486
02:07:06,877 --> 02:07:07,878
It's a mask.

1487
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:09,671
Look...

1488
02:07:09,838 --> 02:07:12,132
what you did to me.

1489
02:07:12,966 --> 02:07:14,384
For what?

1490
02:07:14,551 --> 02:07:16,637
All I wanted to do...

1491
02:07:17,095 --> 02:07:18,764
was to make things...

1492
02:07:19,431 --> 02:07:20,516
perfect.

1493
02:07:21,391 --> 02:07:23,519
You didn't wanna make things perfect.

1494
02:07:23,685 --> 02:07:26,063
You just hated things the way they are.

1495
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:27,564
Kill him.

1496
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:35,239
Why?

1497
02:07:36,031 --> 02:07:38,992
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1498
02:07:40,202 --> 02:07:42,538
We have to get outta here now.

1499
02:07:42,704 --> 02:07:43,664
We have to save them.

1500
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:44,957
We've got all the kids on board.

1501
02:07:45,123 --> 02:07:45,999
No, Pete.

1502
02:07:46,792 --> 02:07:48,418
The rest of them.

1503
02:07:54,216 --> 02:07:56,343
Come on! Come on. Whoa!

1504
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,845
Move!

1505
02:07:58,011 --> 02:07:59,471
Move it, bird!

1506
02:07:59,888 --> 02:08:01,265
-Whoa!
-Come on!

1507
02:08:04,852 --> 02:08:05,853
Come on!

1508
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:07,479
Come on, come on, come on!

1509
02:08:10,941 --> 02:08:13,151
Thought we were limiting ourselves
to the higher life forms?

1510
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:15,237
Yeah, well, me too.

1511
02:08:15,404 --> 02:08:17,531
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1512
02:08:23,537 --> 02:08:24,621
Go, babies.

1513
02:08:24,788 --> 02:08:25,914
Go, babies.

1514
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:27,541
Go!

1515
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:29,877
I cannot hold much...

1516
02:08:36,633 --> 02:08:37,634
Run!

1517
02:08:37,801 --> 02:08:38,927
Go! Go!

1518
02:08:50,439 --> 02:08:51,398
Quill!

1519
02:08:51,565 --> 02:08:52,608
Hurry!

1520
02:09:35,692 --> 02:09:38,153
Peter!

1521
02:10:45,762 --> 02:10:46,763
Peter!

1522
02:10:51,935 --> 02:10:53,854
Did that...

1523
02:10:54,021 --> 02:10:55,480
look...

1524
02:10:56,190 --> 02:10:57,482
cool?

1525
02:11:00,777 --> 02:11:01,653
Come on.

1526
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:16,835
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1527
02:11:54,706 --> 02:11:56,166
I am Groot.

1528
02:11:56,834 --> 02:11:59,211
Thanks. Just tell them I'm gonna be right...

1529
02:12:04,842 --> 02:12:06,218
I am Groot.

1530
02:12:08,095 --> 02:12:10,806
Yeah. It was good working with you, too.

1531
02:12:18,647 --> 02:12:19,648
Hey, Gamora.

1532
02:12:20,107 --> 02:12:21,108
Are you ready?

1533
02:12:21,775 --> 02:12:22,901
Yeah.

1534
02:12:29,116 --> 02:12:30,742
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1535
02:12:32,744 --> 02:12:33,745
I know.

1536
02:12:35,122 --> 02:12:37,249
But who you are ain't so bad.

1537
02:12:57,186 --> 02:12:58,896
I bet we were fun.

1538
02:13:04,151 --> 02:13:05,903
Like you wouldn't believe.

1539
02:13:12,451 --> 02:13:13,493
Okay.

1540
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,842
You okay?

1541
02:13:30,761 --> 02:13:32,930
I think I need to talk to everybody.

1542
02:13:35,015 --> 02:13:37,226
So, you're gonna leave?

1543
02:13:38,894 --> 02:13:40,854
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old...

1544
02:13:41,021 --> 02:13:43,148
and I have been running ever since.

1545
02:13:44,358 --> 02:13:46,360
I'm gonna need to take some time...

1546
02:13:48,445 --> 02:13:49,947
and learn how to swim.

1547
02:13:52,783 --> 02:13:53,784
I as well.

1548
02:13:58,372 --> 02:14:01,250
I love you all. I do.

1549
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:08,549
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted...

1550
02:14:09,091 --> 02:14:11,885
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1551
02:14:12,636 --> 02:14:15,889
I need to go out and discover what I want.

1552
02:14:16,056 --> 02:14:17,015
I'll come with you.

1553
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:19,560
No, Drax. That's the whole point.

1554
02:14:19,726 --> 02:14:21,061
But you need someone to protect you.

1555
02:14:21,228 --> 02:14:23,230
-I don't.
-Not in a bad way.

1556
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:24,773
Just because of your incredible weakness.

1557
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:26,483
Oh, my gosh, you're so frustrating!

1558
02:14:26,650 --> 02:14:27,651
Drax.

1559
02:14:28,318 --> 02:14:29,486
I need you here.

1560
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,780
We're building a new society.

1561
02:14:32,447 --> 02:14:35,075
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1562
02:14:36,285 --> 02:14:38,871
Today, I saw who you are.

1563
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:41,874
You weren't born to be a destroyer.

1564
02:14:43,834 --> 02:14:45,210
You were born to be a dad.

1565
02:14:49,756 --> 02:14:51,717
So, you'll lead the Guardians then?

1566
02:14:52,342 --> 02:14:53,343
No.

1567
02:14:53,927 --> 02:14:55,429
I'm gonna lead the city...

1568
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:57,931
make it the type of home I never had.

1569
02:15:00,684 --> 02:15:01,977
So, that's it?

1570
02:15:03,478 --> 02:15:04,938
The group's over?

1571
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:06,648
No.

1572
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:09,109
Well, the Galaxy still needs its Guardians.

1573
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:13,071
And you will make a better leader
than I ever was...

1574
02:15:13,906 --> 02:15:14,907
Cap'n.

1575
02:15:35,344 --> 02:15:37,095
I love you, guys.

1576
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:46,230
For you.

1577
02:17:42,429 --> 02:17:43,680
Yeah!

1578
02:17:43,847 --> 02:17:45,098
Oh, yeah!

1579
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:51,688
Welcome home.

1580
02:18:39,945 --> 02:18:41,487
I think I might be at the wrong...

1581
02:18:43,323 --> 02:18:44,825
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1582
02:18:44,992 --> 02:18:46,159
Yes.

1583
02:18:46,618 --> 02:18:47,870
Come in.

1584
02:19:06,054 --> 02:19:07,055
Pete?

1585
02:19:13,477 --> 02:19:14,478
Pete.

1586
02:19:19,066 --> 02:19:20,318
Hi, Grandpa.

1587
02:19:49,223 --> 02:19:52,226
Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

1588
02:19:56,271 --> 02:19:57,481
Yeah!

1589
02:19:57,648 --> 02:19:59,233
Yeah!

1590
02:21:23,692 --> 02:21:25,527
Okay, how about your favorite musical act?

1591
02:21:26,153 --> 02:21:27,237
Phyla, you first.

1592
02:21:28,947 --> 02:21:31,783
Britney Spears and Korn.

1593
02:21:32,201 --> 02:21:33,202
Good choices.

1594
02:21:33,368 --> 02:21:35,996
I gotta go with the man. Garth Brooks.

1595
02:21:36,163 --> 02:21:39,291
The Carpenters do not have a single bad song.

1596
02:21:39,458 --> 02:21:40,667
Adrian Belew.

1597
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:44,213
Both solo and his work with King Crimson.

1598
02:21:44,963 --> 02:21:46,548
What about you, Captain?

1599
02:21:46,715 --> 02:21:48,258
This one's kind of special.

1600
02:22:06,235 --> 02:22:07,694
Guess they're here.

1601
02:22:07,861 --> 02:22:11,615
Well, I can handle this by my lonesome...

1602
02:22:11,782 --> 02:22:13,367
if y'all wanna chill.

1603
02:22:13,534 --> 02:22:14,535
Nah, nah.

1604
02:22:14,701 --> 02:22:18,121
It'll go faster if we all do it together.
Groot, wake up.

1605
02:22:29,424 --> 02:22:31,218
Do you ever feel a little sad for them?

1606
02:22:31,385 --> 02:22:34,513
Yeah, sure.
But these townsfolk can't protect themselves.

1607
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:36,932
On your word, <i>Kapitan.</i>

1608
02:22:46,817 --> 02:22:47,818
Word.

1609
02:29:14,538 --> 02:29:16,540
I mean, if she needs help mowing her lawn,
I'll do it...

1610
02:29:16,707 --> 02:29:18,375
but I kinda feel like her son should help.

1611
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:21,170
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

1612
02:29:21,461 --> 02:29:23,255
Like, he's a 45-year-old man...

1613
02:29:23,422 --> 02:29:25,257
able-bodied, and I'm mowing his lawn.

1614
02:29:25,424 --> 02:29:26,592
It just feels weird.

1615
02:29:26,758 --> 02:29:28,177
Don't get me started.

1616
02:29:29,928 --> 02:29:30,929
Oh, really?

1617
02:29:32,639 --> 02:29:33,932
Now I kind of want to know.
