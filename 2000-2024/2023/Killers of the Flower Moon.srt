1
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,127
Tomorrow we will bury this one

2
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:11,759
This Pipe Person.

3
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:19,850
Our messenger to Wah-kon-tah.

4
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:26,148
It is time to bury this Pipe
with dignity...

5
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:30,569
...and put away its teachings.

6
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:34,448
The children outside listening...

7
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:38,911
...they will learn another language.

8
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:43,582
They will be taught by white people.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,131
They will learn new ways...

10
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:56,136
...and will not know our ways.

11
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,748
Phillips
Oil workmen, right here.

12
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,774
Kraceon Oil
pipeline crew, over here.

13
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,515
Burbank Oil Field, over here.

14
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,994
Marland Oil!

15
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,908
Rock hounds
for Phillips Oil, this truck.

16
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:30,350
Make it rich. You can make it
rich. Make it rich. Right here.

17
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,325
Phillips Oil workmen!

18
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,521
Ernest!

19
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:13,349
Yeah.

20
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,916
- Ernest Burkhart?
- Henry. - Yeah.

21
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,483
Henry Roan.

22
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,136
- I'm taking you to your uncle Hale.
- All right.

23
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:19,776
Come on. Let's go.
This is us, right here.

24
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,965
Come on, stop!

25
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,523
Whose land is this, Henry?

26
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:58,873
My land.

27
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,266
My land.

28
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,037
Well, well, well.
Our war hero has arrived.

29
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,780
Welcome home, Ernest.
Welcome home.

30
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:38,608
It's so good to see you again.

31
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm so glad you made it.

32
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:42,394
Brother.

33
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,918
- Thanks for writin', huh?
- Good to have you back, Brother.

34
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,835
Ernest, now, here's your aunt
Myrtle and your cousin, little Willie.

35
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,609
Welcome. It's so good
to see you.

36
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,870
Look how big she's grown.
Isn't that something?

37
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,502
Now, this is a
cattle ranch. There's no oil here.

38
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:08,159
No oil? Yeah. No oil, no fear,
so I'm settled with no fear.

39
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,685
Time will run out.
This wealth will run dry,

40
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,906
drier than the seven years of famine
that plagued the pharaohs of old.

41
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,952
They're a sick people.

42
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,172
They're kindly people, big-hearted
people, but they're sickly.

43
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:25,742
What about you?
You see bloodshed?

44
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:28,658
- Some.
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:32,706
Well, I was a... I was a
cook in... in the infantry.

46
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,098
Mm-hmm.

47
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,883
You see Kelsie Morrison?
He was over there.

48
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,667
- I did.
- Yeah.

49
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,321
- Otis Griggs and the others, if...
- ...if you remember.

50
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:44,587
Soldiers have to eat. You fed
the soldiers that won the war.

51
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:48,417
- Well, saw more die from the flu, but...
- Mmm.

52
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,027
So what happened
to your stomach?

53
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,596
My... My gut, it burst.

54
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,164
Mmm, mmm.
You almost lost your life.

55
00:08:56,338 --> 00:09:00,734
They gave me a belt and told me
not to do any heavy lifting.

56
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,439
Well, you made a good choice
coming back here, 'cause here...

57
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I know.

58
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,610
Money flows freely here, now.

59
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:10,874
Well, I do...
I do love that money, sir.

60
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,267
Don't call me "sir."

61
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:14,835
You call me "Uncle,"

62
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,577
or call me "King," like
you used to. Remember?

63
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,361
- Call you "King"?
- Yeah.

64
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,060
King.

65
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:26,455
Now, you didn't pick up
any disease over there, did you?

66
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:28,239
- No. No.
- Sure?

67
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,893
I'm sure, sir. I'm sure.

68
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,548
Not that I know of.

69
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:35,276
You keep that thing
wrapped up over there?

70
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,118
- I did. I did.
- Mmm.

71
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,337
- As best you could.
- As best I could.

72
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:42,471
Yeah.

73
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,517
You like women?

74
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:50,348
Ah, you know I like women.
That's my weakness.

75
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,089
What kinds they got out there?

76
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,962
- Just white.
- Just white, that I saw. - Hmm.

77
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,485
Mm-hmm.

78
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:57,704
You like red?

79
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:58,966
Red?

80
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,882
- You mean - that kind of red?
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:05,625
I like red. I like white.
I like blue.

82
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,496
I like all of 'em.

83
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,934
Don't matter to me. I'm
greedy. - Mmm.

84
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:16,070
I... I like the heavy ones. I like
the heavy ones, pretty ones, soft,

85
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,029
ones that smell good, you know.

86
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:23,077
Well, we gotta keep an eye
on you. You're all over the place.

87
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:25,775
Uh, speaking of that...

88
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,125
Hey, Byron.

89
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:32,390
Yeah.

90
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,479
Oh.

91
00:10:34,654 --> 00:10:36,873
Oh, yeah, that's good.
That's... That's real good.

92
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:40,094
Don't get played out in the open
with alcohol, you hear?

93
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,184
'Cause then
you'll cause trouble.

94
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,969
- Right, Byron?
- That's right, King.

95
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,233
- Mmm.
- No, sir. I w... I won't. I won't.

96
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,714
Now, most fellas out here
are crooked.

97
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:55,936
Some do things right, most
do bad, so don't be simple.

98
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,026
- No, sir. I won't.
- Don't make small trouble about nothing.

99
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,332
You gonna make trouble,
make it big.

100
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,857
Get a big payoff for that,
you hear?

101
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,685
Yes, sir.

102
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:09,079
You see, I am officially
reserve deputy sheriff in Fairfax.

103
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:13,475
I don't want to bring
unwanted eyes.

104
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,520
- I won't find that trouble.
- Yeah.

105
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:17,435
I won't do stupid things.

106
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,654
And you got your head on
straight after being over there?

107
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:24,616
Course I do. I'm not... I'm not
thick, sir. I'm... I'm... I'm strong.

108
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,532
Well, I got a place
I'm gonna put you.

109
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:29,273
- That'll be driving.
- Mmm.

110
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,798
'Cause you can't do much else
'cause of your gut.

111
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,235
You don't read much, do you?

112
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,845
Read?

113
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,629
Do you read, yeah. Read much?

114
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:39,719
Well, I can read.

115
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,546
Eh. Well,
you smarten yourself up.

116
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,332
Get him that book
on the Osage, Byron.

117
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:45,942
- This one?
- Yeah, that one.

118
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,772
- You smarten yourself up.
- I... I can read, sir.

119
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:55,865
The Osage.
They have the worst land possible...

120
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,913
...but the good Lord,
he outsmarted everybody.

121
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,220
The land had oil on it.
Black gold.

122
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,528
But they're wise people.

123
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:12,490
They worked it so as they had the say
who gets the oil, who gets the headrights.

124
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,797
The Osage are sharp.

125
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,541
They don't talk much,
so that might make you feel

126
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,755
like you've got to run
your mouth to fill the space,

127
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,545
especially you been drinking.

128
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:27,114
Better you be quiet if you
don't got nothing smart to say.

129
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,811
Don't get caught on that.

130
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,683
It's what they call,
"blackbird talk."

131
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,213
Blackbird talk.

132
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,002
Just 'cause they're not talking,

133
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:49,092
don't mean they don't know
everything about everything.

134
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:53,575
Yeah, Osage are the finest and
most beautiful people on God's earth.

135
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:17,207
<i>John Whitehair, age 23.</i>

136
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,212
<i>No investigation.</i>

137
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:27,696
<i>Bill Stepson, age 29.</i>

138
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,135

<i>Anna Sanford, age 41.</i>

140
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,018
<i>No investigation.</i>

141
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,848
<i>Rose Lewis...</i>

00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,548
<i>age 25.</i>

143
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:59,075
<i>No investigation.</i>

144
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,430
There we go.

145
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:25,188
<i>And Sara Butler, age 21.</i>

146
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:27,756
<i>Suicide.</i>

147
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,499
State your name.

148
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:35,851
I'm Mollie Kyle. Incompetent.

149
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,288
What is your allotment number?

150
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,637
Two hundred eighty-five.

151
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:45,121
You've asked for
additional moneys of $752

152
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:48,168
to pay a medical bill
for an abscess.

153
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,474
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,824
Was the operation successful?

155
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:54,914
Yes, sir.

156
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,307
And the diabetes?

157
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:02,095
I have a prescription at Fairfax Drugs.
I'll send my help to fill twice monthly.

158
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,662
You gotta look out for that,
you know.

159
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:10,233
Now, Mollie, it's your mother.

160
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:15,499
You know she's restricted too, so
we have to account for every penny.

161
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:23,159
It says here she spent
$319 and 05 cents for meat

162
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,857
at the grocery.

163
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,993
Don't you think that's an awful
lot of meat for what she needs?

164
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,083
Yes, Mr. Beaty.

165
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,826
Well, you'll look after that,
won't you?

166
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,351
Yes.

167
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:49,185
All right, people. Let's form a
line here for allotment payments.

168
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,361
Unrestricted only.

169
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:55,757
Restricted, take your guardian. He
has to be with you to sign your checks.

170
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,890
You need to find your guardian.
Nothing new this time, folks.

171
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,936
Thirty-dollar photo
for posterity.

172
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,373
Don't you wanna preserve
your family history? Come on.

173
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,525
How about you, sir? You... Now,
don't go after him.

174
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,943
He don't know nothing.
He's an amateur.

175
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:11,294
You need a proper photo
for you and your family.

176
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:14,732
For you, sir? $40.
For you, sir? $40.

177
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:16,256
How much? $40?$40.

178
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,432
All right. I got $35
cash for you right now.

179
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,406
- Take it or leave it.
- Thirty-five's a deal.

180
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:21,739
Let's have it, get it done.

181
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,437
Y'all are gonna make
a pretty picture.

182
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:25,134
Y'all, come on this way,
over here.

183
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:41,629
My wife's been feeling poorly.
The doctor says it's her constitution.

184
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,413
The boy's got asthma.

185
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,025
His asthma's holding him back.
He just needs a chance.

186
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,028
You've got your checks.
You're unrestricted. Please.

187
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,383
We'll take one. In that color.

188
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,777
Thank you. Thank you!

189
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,476
I'll tell you what, you run
out of gas, you get a flat tire,

190
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,304
you come right on back
and buy another.

191
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,878
Ma'am, you need a
ride? That's my bucket, right there.

192
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:29,155
Thank you.

193
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:34,290
Gotta be careful. A lot of
characters around here today.

194
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,995
Hey, Ernest!

195
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,563
Hey, Kelsie Morrison!

196
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:48,870
- We were at the front - together in France.
- Hey!

197
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:52,003
- How you doing?
- Great to see you! - You too. You too.

198
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:53,440
My wife, Catherine Cole.

199
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,746
Oh, pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

200
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,008
Full blood.

201
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,229
Sky People, right? Sky People?

202
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,145
- Middle Water. Middle Water.
- Oh.

203
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,278
Lot of money on this.

204
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,216
Whoo!

205
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,610
You got money on this race?

206
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:34,829
No. No.

207
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,265
Let's go, then.

208
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:38,702
Yep.

209
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,072
<i>I'm sorry to hear
she's not doing good.</i>

210
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,162
You know, Father,
just as stubborn as ever.

211
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,599
Tell your mom I'm praying
for her, okay?

212
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,470
- Take care. Yeah.
- Thank you, Father.

213
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,438
<i>You know who I mean
when I say Mollie Kyle?</i>

214
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,048
<i>You know the one,
with the sisters.</i>

215
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,530
- I know which one.
- Mollie. - Yeah. Mollie.

216
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,184
She lives with her mother, Lizzie.

217
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,839
I know, Uncle, which one.
I know her.

218
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,928
I've bee...
I've been driving her.

219
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:32,974
- Driving her?
- Yeah.

220
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,673
Matt Williams used
to go with her for a time.

221
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,632
They're not together
in a way now,

222
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,895
so that means

223
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:44,420
you could have a proposition
with that if that struck you.

224
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,249
Oh.

225
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:52,036
You want... You want me
to see after her.

226
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:55,083
- She's a regular customer of mine.
- Yeah.

227
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,085
I think she...
she's sweet on me too.

228
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,046
- That Mollie, - she's easy to like. Yeah.
- Yeah.

229
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:03,918
Full blood estate, at that, too.

230
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:08,052
- Full... Full blood estate.
- Full... Full blood estate.

231
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:11,230
Now, that's something
a man can work with, hmm?

232
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,673
You got a good face,
you know that?

233
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,112
Think you can be
the marrying kind?

234
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,028
- Marrying kind?
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:28,943
Uh, how do you mean?

236
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,380
Well, we mix
these families together,

237
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:34,862
and that estate money flows
the right direction, it'll come to us.

238
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:42,652
That's a full blood estate. And she
gets that money of the mother Lizzie.

239
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,743
Now, that's good business there.
And legal, not against the law.

240
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,006
That's smart investment.

241
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:05,066
They told me you was... you was
going with Matt Williams for a time.

242
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,766
You talk too much.

243
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,944
Nah. Nah, I don't talk too much.

244
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:17,948
Just thinking who I gotta beat
in this horse race, that's all.

245
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,822
I didn't realize
this was a race.

246
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,479
I don't care
for watching horses.

247
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,699
Well, I'm a different
kind of horse.

248
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:37,838
What?

249
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:39,535
What was that?

250
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,800
That's how you are.

251
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:47,369
I don't know what you said, but it
must've been Indian for "handsome devil."

252
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:01,644

You got nice color skin. You-You
got... You got a nice house.

344
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:46,587
I think you just pretend
to be so severe.

345
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:49,851
Bet you... I bet you got a
soft belly on the inside there.

346
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:55,901
Oh, you just
called me a coyote, didn't you?

347
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,774
Coyote.

348
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:04,692
Coyote wants money.

349
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,955
- Well, that money's - real nice.
- Mmm.

350
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:10,480
It's real nice, especially
if you're lazy like me.

351
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:15,442
I mean, I wanna sleep all day, and I
wanna make a party when it's dark.

352
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,884
What's so funny, hmm?

353
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,364
You like <i>peh-tseh nee?</i>

354
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,932
- Whiskey.
- Mmm.

355
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,544
I don't like whiskey,
I love whiskey.

356
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,810
I have good whiskey,
not bad whiskey.

357
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,814
I think we should try some
and find out.

358
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,962
No, no. No. No, don't close it.

359
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,661
- What?
- Uh, we...

360
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:03,316
We need to be quiet for a while.

361
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,077
The storm, it's, uh...

362
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:30,952
Well, it's powerful.

363
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,781
So we need to be quiet
for a while.

364
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:44,879
- It's good for the crops, - that's for sure.
- Just be still.

365
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,520
Bill Smith.

366
00:32:19,044 --> 00:32:20,480
Bill Smith.

367
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:23,004
- Ernest. Ernest Burkhart.
- Good to meet you, Ernest.

368
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:24,963
I'm Minnie's husband.

369
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,444
It might make you feel a little
better if you eat something.

370
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:20,844
No, not again. Aw!

371
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,021
He's not that smart...

372
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,941
...but he's handsome.

373
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,944
He looks like a snake.

374
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:32,948
No, he looks like Coyote.

375
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,576
Those Blue Eyes.

376
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:41,331
His brother is handsome, too.
I like the brother more.

377
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,043
That red haired rat?

378
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,009
Better than your possum
playing dead...

379
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,595
...and lazing around the house.

380
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,348
He's a possum around you...

381
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:00,768
...he's like a rabbit to me.

382
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:02,103
Oh!

383
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,104
Be quiet...!

384
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,440
...Coyote's watching.

385
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,527
He wants our money.

386
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:13,322
Of course he wants money...

387
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,366
...but he wants to be settled.

388
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:20,913
He's not restless.

389
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,874
His Uncle has money...

390
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:26,376
...it's not money he wants...

391
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,086
...he loves you.

392
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:48,106
Slow down.

393
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:57,158
Your hand looks
on my skin...

394
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:13,348
You're gonna marry me, Mollie.

395
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:17,439
I want you to be my wife.

396
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,400
Will you do that?

397
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:35,327
Can you stand her kind?

398
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:42,116
I love this girl. Mollie.

399
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,250
Uncle, I...
I really do think she's a lady.

400
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:50,037
Well, then you found a wife.

401
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,006
<i>Mollie.</i>

402
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:05,444
Ernest.

403
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,481
I've known
Mollie and her sisters

404
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:45,658
since they were little girls running
around, making a lot of trouble.

405
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,881
Mollie's dear
departed father, Nah-kah-e-se-y,

406
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:55,363
was a dear, dear friend of mine,
a beloved friend of the heart.

407
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:57,897
<i>He always used to tell the
white men just to call him Jimmy,</i>

408
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:01,978
<i>but I always called him by his
proper name, Nah-kah-e-se-y.</i>

409
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,154
<i>We had great respect
for each other.</i>

410
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:54,509
You and me.

411
00:37:54,683 --> 00:37:56,076
Whoo!

412
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,124
Keep going right.
I'm going right.

413
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:22,189
Minnie.

414
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,110
What do you need for, Minnie?

415
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:31,285
No, sir.

416
00:38:32,155 --> 00:38:33,853
You well taken care of?

417
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,726
Yes.

418
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,688
You have proper medicines?

419
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:48,084
'Cause I want you to know you
have the best care if you need.

420
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:49,912
I don't want you to be afraid.

421
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,399
So many troubles that we've
brought upon you, all of you.

422
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,270
I'm so sorry.

423
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,796
I'm so sorry.

424
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:46,404
<i>Minnie. My sister.</i>

425
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,059
<i>Wasting illness.</i>

426
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,344
Anna.

427
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:29,577
Ernest.

428
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,231
Yeah?

429
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:34,321
Ernest, it might be best
for you to sit outside.

430
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,846
What... Well, why's that?

431
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:40,849
It's just the way this is going.

432
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:43,548
If you don't mind.

433
00:40:48,335 --> 00:40:52,165
"The way this is going"? You...
You're saying you want me outside?

434
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:53,732
Yes, sir, if you would.

435
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,563
All right.

436
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:05,831
- Bill Smith.
- Mmm.

437
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,095
Yeah.

438
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,838
It shows itself to you

439
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,276
that Bill Smith didn't take the proper
care of Minnie the way he could have.

440
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,975
To have her sick and die, take
her headrights and her land?

441
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,458
That oil, which should go
to her sisters, your wife,

442
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:27,374
well, he's taking money that,
by rights, should go to Mollie.

443
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,161
The mother, Lizzie.

444
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:40,169
She's not in good shape.

445
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:41,954
She won't last.

446
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:46,001
Most Osage don't live past 50.

447
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,482
With these women dying,

448
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,571
with how Osage suffer
from illness,

449
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:53,182
you have to make it
the headrights come to you.

450
00:41:54,836 --> 00:41:56,098
You see?

451
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,449
Yeah.

452
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:01,147
<i>Minnie's gone now,</i>

453
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:03,541
<i>and after her, that leaves...</i>

454
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:05,760
Reta... Mmm.

455
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,240
...Anna,

456
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,373
and then, of course,
there's Mollie.

457
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:13,681
Yeah.

458
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,163
How's Mollie feeling?

459
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:19,121
She's... She's all right.

460
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,342
Takes care of the little one.

461
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:28,478
- She's got the, uh... the diabetes too.
- Yeah.

462
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:34,049
I worry for her sometimes.
She's... She's sick most days, King.

463
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:38,184
Of course she is. How could she
not be? This diabetes is a trial to bear.

464
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:42,318
<i>Like it says in the book of Job,</i>

465
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,452
<i>the days of affliction
have taken hold upon her.</i>

466
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:52,851
Well, Mollie, she's still
strong, King. She's strong.

467
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:56,594
Yeah, for now.
We hope, forever, but...

468
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:03,862
What about Anna? You know
Anna carries a gun in her purse?

469
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:06,255
Hey, what the hell?

470
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:08,954
I know you get around...

471
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,739
Shit!

472
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:14,786
What the hell?
Fucking crazy squaw!

473
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,745
Now, I love Anna,

474
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:20,966
but she's gonna pick a fight
one day with the wrong person.

475
00:43:21,706 --> 00:43:22,706
And then what?

476
00:44:54,755 --> 00:44:57,236
Hey. Stop
it. Put it all on the table.

477
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:06,027
- Stop it. Manners.
- Nobody's got any manners here.

478
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:08,601
Did you see the Owl?

479
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:17,902
When you do...

480
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,740
...it's a sign that we are dying.

481
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,618
Because... of you.

482
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:30,915
You all marry white men.

483
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:35,837
Our blood is getting white.

484
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:41,801
Where's Anna?

485
00:45:42,886 --> 00:45:45,013
I want Anna.

486
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:46,806
I'm here.

487
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,267
I don't want you.

488
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:51,394
I want Anna.

489
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:01,082
Let's get all of them.

490
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:04,129
This one's whiter than that one.

491
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,914
You'd never know this one's
a half-breed, would you?

492
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:11,832
They're both a couple of little half-assed
savages, as far as I'm concerned.

493
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:15,488
Bless their little hearts, now,
they can't help it.

494
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:21,624
One dark and one light.
And it's like an eclipse.

495
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:27,500
The Lord put his hand over the
earth and made it shake for nothing.

496
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:30,677
Oh, goodness.

497
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:32,461
- Take care, Anna.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

498
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:34,854
Are you laughing?

499
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:36,564
Not yet... but...

500
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,574
I brought blankets for Momma.

501
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,826
You're drunk already?

502
00:46:49,035 --> 00:46:52,162
I'm still drunk from last
night, you woke me up.

503
00:46:52,163 --> 00:46:54,581
Don't let Momma see you this way.

504
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,251
Don't fuss on me.

505
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:02,535
Hello, Anna.
You steady?

506
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:05,494
Oh, I am pickled.

507
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,669
You got any whiskey?

508
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:08,541
Well, you drank it last night.

509
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:10,848
Only my man can drink
my whiskey.

510
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:12,501
I'm not your man.

511
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:14,852
Well, maybe you don't have
a choice.

512
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:18,106
Are you making threats?

513
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,359
Hey, hey.

514
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:21,684
Keep yourself settled down
in here, Anna.

515
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,122
You'll do right.

516
00:47:25,123 --> 00:47:27,386
You're making threats, Anna.
Don't do that.

517
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,823
I'm telling you a secret.

518
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:31,956
You think I open my legs
for any man?

519
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,306
Well, I get that feeling.

520
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,960
- Hey! Hey!
- Come on, now.

521
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,657
Get her in the other room now.

522
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:39,441
You are no different,
Ernest. Hear me?

523
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:41,269
- You are no different.
- Get in the other room!

524
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,978
Older sister, calm down.

525
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:45,578
Yeah, I'm all right.

526
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,333
You are so pretty.

527
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,859
You know me?

528
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,905
Yes.

529
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:09,732
What do you know?

530
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:13,388
Fuck yourself, Byron Burkhart.

531
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,642
- Anna! Anna!
- Hey! Come on, now! Anna!

532
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:18,782
I will cut you, talking to my man!
I'll kill that woman, then I'll kill you!

533
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:21,396
- Stand down.
- I'm not your man. I'll do as I please.

534
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,355
Get her out of here!

535
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,089
Give me that. She's got a gun!

536
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:26,227
Give me that. Come on!

537
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:27,681
Stay away
from these white women!

538
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,056
Stay away from those
<i>wahk' oh nohn-hohn!</i>

539
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:30,057
Move!

540
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:32,146
Get out!

541
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:37,107
Savage!

542
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:48,423
Come on, Charlie. Right up here.

543
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:03,134
This one French soldier, he came
up, he tried to grab that saucer pan.

544
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:06,267
I saw his leg blown clean off.

545
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:10,228
A lot of them came back
like this. Shaking.

546
00:49:12,273 --> 00:49:13,273
Hey.

547
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:14,797
Mmm.

548
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:18,192
Did you hear they found
Charlie Whitehorn dead?

549
00:49:18,366 --> 00:49:21,630
Aye. Aye. Who did that?

550
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:23,981
I don't know.

551
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:27,201
Was it his wife?

552
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,203
Mm-hmm. Most likely.

553
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,733
Now, Anna...

554
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,654
It's time for me
to take her home now.

555
00:49:58,307 --> 00:49:59,161
You're...

556
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:02,979
...wild.

557
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:10,984
Anna.
Anna, <i>mahn-theen eh-txahn.</i>

558
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:12,681
Byron's waiting. Come on.

559
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:14,901
- Mmm.
- Come on, now.

560
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:17,034
Mmm.

561
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:23,833
You're my best blessing.

562
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:28,004
I'm your favorite?

563
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:37,221
...stay with me here.

564
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:40,666
- Anna, come on, now.
- Stop banging.

565
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:56,682
Time for
me to go, Ernest?

566
00:50:58,684 --> 00:50:59,728
Yeah.

567
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,645
You don't want me here, do you?

568
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:07,040
You trying to get rid of me,
aren't you, snake? Aw.

569
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:11,218
You're afraid I'll say too much.

570
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,744
Yeah, I see you're afraid.

571
00:51:21,794 --> 00:51:22,969
You look better.

572
00:51:23,143 --> 00:51:24,927
Why, thank you, Sister.

573
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:30,672
You're my wealth, you know that?

574
00:51:33,653 --> 00:51:35,279
Don't go out tonight.

575
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,331
You worry
too much, <i>oh-theh-zhoo.</i>

576
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:39,377
Come on. Let's go.

577
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:40,769
Okay.

578
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:44,077
Goodness, let's go find
another drink.

579
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:45,861
No, I'm taking you home, Anna.

580
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:48,125
No, you're taking me
to Whizbang.

581
00:51:50,562 --> 00:51:52,477
Byron's taking her home now.

582
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,043
I'm too drunk.

583
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:55,219
You don't say.

584
00:51:55,393 --> 00:51:56,959
He's taking her home.

585
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:17,371
Mollie,
it's your sister, Anna.

586
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:01,720
Come on, now.
Come on, now, sweetheart.

587
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:03,025
Come on, now.

588
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:07,813
Come on.

589
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:17,083
Is this your sister, Anna Brown?

590
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:23,872
Pardon me.
Is this your sister, Anna Brown?

591
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:26,439
Yes...

592
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,192
<i>Two members of our tribe,</i>

593
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,587
<i>Anna Brown
and Charles Whitehorn...</i>

594
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,980
<i>...were both murdered.</i>

595
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:47,505
These <i>ahn-shdah-heh</i>
are murdering us.

596
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:51,356
In the case of Anna Brown,

597
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:53,337
her family here on the west side
have raised funds

598
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:56,514
of the amount of about
$2,000 to $5,000

599
00:53:56,688 --> 00:54:00,039
for the arrest and conviction
of the murderer.

600
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:05,087
Mollie Burkhart has hired
a private investigator.

601
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:10,876
When this money started coming,

602
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,052
we should've known
it came with something else.

603
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:15,663
'Cause it's the white man's money.

604
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:21,190
It's not what we were taught, coming
out of Missouri, Arkansas and Kansas.

605
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:25,194
What has come to our reservation
that doesn't belong here?

606
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:29,982
And it's them. They're like
buzzards circling our people.

607
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:31,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

608
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,987
They wanna pick us body clean,
leave nothing.

609
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,381
When we left Missouri,

610
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:39,992
we didn't even leave
our dead babies.

611
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,256
We laid 'em down and we rode
our warriors over 'em

612
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,174
to tell everyone that we'll
never leave this place again.

613
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:50,829
Or we'll die here,
to the last one.

614
00:54:51,003 --> 00:54:52,723
Yeah. Yeah.

615
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,761
Switch.

616
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:24,645
Hey, Mollie. Mollie,
words can't express my grief,

617
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:27,126
but she's with the Lord now.

618
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,780
She's with the Lord.

619
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:37,266
And they even
come here now to marry our young women.

620
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,792
I employ some of them.

621
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:44,230
They say they are my friends,
but I don't think they really are.

622
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,469
<i>Some of them
don't even pretend to work.</i>

623
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:48,495
<i>They walk around, they
act like they own the place.</i>

624
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:50,845
- Okay, gentlemen. Hold still, please.
- We got it!

625
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:55,110
I mean, these people are bums,
<i>nee-shdah-heh,</i> common vags.

626
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:59,724
We can't turn to the county
to help us.

627
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:04,555
We can't go to the state
of Oklahoma to help us.

628
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:07,906
Why have we ever even thought
they would?

629
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,865
We were here before them.

630
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,737
This is our homeland we came to.

631
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,782
Yeah. Yeah.

632
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:18,177
Why we put our children here is
because Mother Earth allowed us here.

633
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:19,918
Yeah.

634
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:23,835
No one takes us off this earth
until God calls us all home.

635
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,010
Yeah.

636
00:56:25,184 --> 00:56:26,838
And we've got to realize that,

637
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:29,252
but we've also got to realize
this evil that's come here.

638
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:31,190
You have something it wants.

639
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:34,498
- Yeah.
- It didn't want you when we was coming through genocides,

640
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:36,587
our coming home.

641
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:40,721
But now we put the original
25 families together in this room.

642
00:56:40,895 --> 00:56:41,895
Yeah.

643
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,855
And we're here to go with you.

644
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:48,555
The old saying says is that...
that Osage is dying by the enemy.

645
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:52,907
Do not let them die alone.
You go join them.

646
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:56,824
So we can go to heaven
knowing we're still warriors.

647
00:56:56,998 --> 00:57:02,526
We have to change, but before we
do, we need to be like a fire on this earth

648
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,268
and get rid of all that stops
or gets in front of us.

649
00:57:06,443 --> 00:57:09,620
My council, I ask you
for your support.

650
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:14,842
All of you men. And our women,
these mothers, these <i>ee-nahn</i> here.

651
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:18,150
All of our elders have
come through this landscape,

652
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:22,110
and we... only thing we know
is that we have each other.

653
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:26,201
We have a Lord
that's been good to us.

654
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,857
And this... this other... We
never prayed for the great life.

655
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,164
We just prayed for life.

656
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:34,601
And that's what
I'm gonna be praying for now,

657
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:37,735
is that we get that life
for these kids coming.

658
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:39,867
And, see, our days are over.

659
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:43,480
We're just barely
living out a sundown,

660
00:57:43,654 --> 00:57:46,091
but their days are starting.

661
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:50,051
And I want 'em to be Osages, just
like the gift that Grandma gave me,

662
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,663
just like the gift
that Grandma gave you.

663
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,362
Thank you, Chief.

664
00:57:56,536 --> 00:58:00,018
I would like to add a thousand
dollars to that reward money...

665
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:05,893
...for any information
about these murders.

666
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:10,289
That means if anyone knows
anything about it, you must come to me.

667
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:15,250
You all know where I am.
I'm easy to find.

668
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,984
Thank you, Mr. Hale.

669
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,075
Your friendship has always been
greatly appreciated.

670
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:23,345
I'll do anything, anything, to
help the Osage in their plight,

671
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,304
in their vale of tears.

672
00:58:25,478 --> 00:58:29,308
I move that we send Mr. Barney
McBride to Washington, D.C.

673
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:30,483
I will second that.

674
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:32,877
Mr. McBride, Mrs. McBride.

675
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,792
Yes, Chief. I'm here.

676
00:58:34,966 --> 00:58:38,317
Resolution 23. Mr. McBride
will travel to Washington, D.C.

677
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:40,362
to meet with
the Indian Affairs Commission,

678
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:44,366
where he will ask for private
investigators and additional police

679
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:46,978
so that they can look into
this matter of all this death.

680
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,153
Do you accept this?

681
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:49,371
Yes, I do.

682
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,601
Bill. Reta.

683
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,647
How are you, Ernest?

684
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:08,739
So you're, uh...
you're here now, huh?

685
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,306
Reta was a comfort to me
when Minnie died.

686
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,852
Hey, listen. Leave the
jewels be on this one, all right?

687
00:59:35,026 --> 00:59:37,332
Oh, I... I do it
so nobody notices.

688
00:59:37,506 --> 00:59:41,641
No, no. Come on, Frank. Just... just
leave it be, just this one time, for me.

689
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:45,210
It's my wife's sister,
all right? There.

690
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:47,952
$25 for a hearse rental?

691
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:53,871
Uh... $1,650 for-for
a mahogany casket?

692
00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:57,875
You charging me Osage prices.
You think I'm thick, huh?

693
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,877
No, everybody pays the same.

694
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:03,707
Come on, now. McAllister's
entire funeral wasn't more than 300.

695
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:05,447
This here...
This here's 2,000, Frank.

696
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:07,624
McAllister's daughter
was just a youngster.

697
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:10,627
I'll tell you what. I'ma talk
to King Hale about this.

698
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:12,454
See what he has to say.

699
01:00:12,629 --> 01:00:14,949
Well, if you want her in a
wooden box, I'll put her in one.

700
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:18,852
I... I don't want no wooden box, all
right? You are charging me Osage prices.

701
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:21,942
Your wife even said
she wanted an open casket.

702
01:00:22,682 --> 01:00:24,423
But there's no face.

703
01:00:24,597 --> 01:00:28,645
There's no face, Frank.
Why would she want it open, huh?

704
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:30,995
You trying to steal our money?
Is that what you're trying...

705
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:32,039
It ain't...

706
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,520
It ain't your money.

707
01:00:34,694 --> 01:00:38,393
It's easy for you to get me
more money and pay my bill.

708
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:41,092
I work for my money.

709
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:45,662
Just like the good Lord says,
you sow and reap, Ernest.

710
01:00:45,836 --> 01:00:49,230
When was the last time you've seen
one of them Osages working, huh?

711
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:53,147
Well, your
sister, Anna, leaves an estate

712
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:56,368
of approximately $100,000

713
01:00:56,542 --> 01:01:02,026
to be willed to your mother, Lizzie
Q., and you, Mollie, and you, Reta.

714
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:07,379
You know, I was thinking, that
is a substantial amount of money.

715
01:01:07,553 --> 01:01:10,643
I heard that Tall Chief hired
the Emmett Miller minstrel show

716
01:01:10,817 --> 01:01:12,906
to come in and play
for his birthday party,

717
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,346
and I thought, "Why... Why couldn't we
do something like that with this money?"

718
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,785
Maybe have a party for the town,
and maybe invite another band out.

719
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:24,657
<i>It does not do
to talk to this man.</i>

720
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,792
<i>Evil surrounds my heart.</i>

721
01:01:29,531 --> 01:01:31,664
<i>Many times, I cry,</i>

722
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,320
<i>and this evil around my heart
comes out of my eyes.</i>

723
01:01:39,716 --> 01:01:42,544
<i>I close my heart
and keep what is good there,</i>

724
01:01:43,676 --> 01:01:45,199
<i>but hate comes.</i>

725
01:01:47,158 --> 01:01:50,727
<i>And they say I ought to kill these
white men who killed my family.</i>

726
01:01:54,034 --> 01:01:58,038
Mrs. Burkhart. Bill Burns.
I solve crimes.

727
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:00,345
This is my card.

728
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,826
My address is New York,
London, Paris,

729
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,916
Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Cairo, Berlin, Boston

730
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,874
and wherever else
a law-abiding citizen...

731
01:02:08,048 --> 01:02:10,311
Mr. Barney McBride? Yes.

732
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:12,605
Telegram
for you, sir. Just arrived.

733
01:02:40,037 --> 01:02:43,344
...hasn't been to Anna's
place to corroborate Byron's story.

734
01:02:43,518 --> 01:02:47,174
Now, I stopped by there, and
I did find her alligator purse,

735
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:50,351
which could suggest that Byron
is not lying. He brought her home.

736
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:54,442
Well, my...
my brother's not a liar.

737
01:02:56,270 --> 01:03:01,058
Uh, your youngest sister, Minnie, who
died of the wasting illness two years ago,

738
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:03,321
she was married
to a "Bill Smith."

739
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:05,453
Yes.

740
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:09,718
And that is the same Bill Smith
currently married to your sister, Reta.

741
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,284
Yes.

742
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,722
Same Bill Smith.

743
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:17,335
Two sisters.

744
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:23,080
<i>Mr. Smith, he is a busy fellow,
talking around town,</i>

745
01:03:23,254 --> 01:03:25,822
<i>conducting his own investigation
into Anna's death.</i>

746
01:03:25,996 --> 01:03:27,867
- Much obliged, Sheriff.
- Thank you, sir. - Thank y'all again.

747
01:03:27,868 --> 01:03:28,955
Appreciate it.

748
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:30,652
<i>Were you aware of that?</i>

749
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,047
You were?

750
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:36,093
Yes.

751
01:03:38,312 --> 01:03:39,923
Now, you went straight
to Mollie's house?

752
01:03:40,097 --> 01:03:41,489
We didn't
go straight there.

753
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:42,839
Where'd you go?

754
01:03:43,013 --> 01:03:45,102
Graveyard out past Florer's.

755
01:03:45,276 --> 01:03:48,540
She wanted to look at her land,
then she wanted to visit her father.

756
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:51,325
Mm-mmm,
I cannot see my daddy

757
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:53,762
with my hair flying everywhere.

758
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:56,156
Did you know I was gonna have
a little baby?

759
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,594
- Oh, my goodness, no.
- Oh, it's true.

760
01:03:59,768 --> 01:04:02,075
I'm gonna name her
Minnie too.

761
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:10,257
Give Minnie my love.

762
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:15,132
Did you know
that Anna was pregnant?

763
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,573
Anna?

764
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:24,054
Yes.

765
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,539
Anna was pregnant.

766
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:33,541
She was pregnant.

767
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:35,456
Did he say Byron?

768
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,241
No.

769
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:41,158
Me?

770
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,336
No. No.

771
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,035
Well, you make sure
we steer clear of that.

772
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:55,128
Mr. Smith says that he has a pretty
good idea who killed your sister.

773
01:04:56,216 --> 01:04:58,740
He says that he will tell all

774
01:04:59,524 --> 01:05:01,004
when he has the true facts.

775
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:06,183
So what, uh...
What's he found out?

776
01:05:06,357 --> 01:05:08,359
I just don't know that part yet.

777
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:10,491
What's he found out?

778
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:12,624
Nothing.

779
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:15,932
I'll go see Blackie.

780
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:22,416
On that, what we talked about...

781
01:05:23,113 --> 01:05:24,113
About it, yeah.

782
01:05:24,244 --> 01:05:25,854
To see what he may say on that.

783
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,769
That's right.

784
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:38,955
Ah, yeah. Yeah! Boy,
we gonna be rich tonight, boy!

785
01:05:41,696 --> 01:05:43,568
- Ernest.
- Where's Blackie?

786
01:05:46,919 --> 01:05:48,921
- That's it, huh?
- Yeah.

787
01:05:50,183 --> 01:05:51,358
Osage graves.

788
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:52,932
That's disgusting work,
right there.

789
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:55,145
It's dirty. It's real dirty.

790
01:05:56,276 --> 01:05:58,800
You want something
to pay big, Blackie, hmm?

791
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:00,889
You can't be working
with them trouble boys.

792
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:04,110
You gotta use your head.
You gotta think, Blackie.

793
01:06:04,284 --> 01:06:07,331
Hale, he's been... He's been
talking about us partnering up.

794
01:06:07,984 --> 01:06:09,898
Hmm.

795
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:13,293
You know Bill Smith? He's... He's
been going around town talking a lot.

796
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:20,213
Now, if someone were to knock off
Bill Smith and... and Reta too, right?

797
01:06:20,387 --> 01:06:25,218
If she was gone, all that estate money
would go to my mother-in-law, Lizzie Q.,

798
01:06:25,392 --> 01:06:27,046
and she wills it to my children.

799
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:31,659
Now, that's a good deal, that.
It's a real good deal.

800
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,357
- For you, it is.
- Mm-mmm.

801
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,836
For all.

802
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:37,013
Smith and her,
they're gone a lot from home.

803
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:39,276
All you gotta do is go down there,
and you plant the stand in the house.

804
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:41,626
- And when they come in...
- ...you get 'em.

805
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,499
They got... Reta's got three or four
diamonds. She got some ear screws.

806
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:47,893
Bill Smith, he always carries
two or three hundred in his pocket.

807
01:06:47,894 --> 01:06:50,069
You could have that.

808
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:54,073
You could have that, and... and I know
Hale would pay you a thousand for the job.

809
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:57,642
That sound like
a good one to you, Blackie?

810
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,601
Hmm.

811
01:07:02,342 --> 01:07:04,997
You know my little
Buick roadster?

812
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:07,091
You know, the red one
you always got your eye on.

813
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:08,870
Yeah?

814
01:07:09,045 --> 01:07:11,351
<i>How about I throw in
my Buick roadster?</i>

815
01:07:11,525 --> 01:07:13,614
<i>It's insured more
than it's worth.</i>

816
01:07:13,788 --> 01:07:16,487
<i>Now, I'd get the insurance
money, and you'd get the Buick.</i>

817
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:20,708
That... that's just a little side
deal between me and you.

818
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:22,971
Hale doesn't need to know
about that one.

819
01:07:23,146 --> 01:07:25,148
But that's real generous.

820
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:27,628
Goddamn, you're a greedy Jew, Ernest.

821
01:07:29,935 --> 01:07:32,068
Well, I just love money.

822
01:07:32,242 --> 01:07:36,246
It's true. It's true. I damn near
love it as much as I love my wife.

823
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:42,252
Ernest?

824
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:43,644
Yeah.

825
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:45,690
Come here.

826
01:07:51,348 --> 01:07:52,436
What is it, huh?

827
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:56,744
Feeling better
than this morning, huh?

828
01:07:56,918 --> 01:07:58,485
A little.

829
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:03,795
Yeah. You just... You just
need sleep, I tell you, hmm?

830
01:08:03,969 --> 01:08:06,058
Sleep.
That's the first thing now.

831
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:09,540
I don't sleep anymore.

832
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:15,415
I know. I know. Just... Just try.
You try to get some rest, all right?

833
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:17,113
Come on, now.

834
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:24,642
I don't even know
if you love me anymore.

835
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:28,254
Mollie, of course I love you.

836
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,692
I need you here.

837
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:38,046
I'm right here, Mollie.
I am right here.

838
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:42,703
I love you.

839
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:16,911
Oh, you gonna
try to wake the kids up now.

840
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:22,439
You gonna wake the kids up.

841
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:26,051
Yeah. Yeah.

842
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:34,015
<i>They're calling it "insulin."
It's from Toronto and costs dearly.</i>

843
01:09:35,495 --> 01:09:38,063
<i>There ain't more than five
people that can afford it.</i>

844
01:09:38,237 --> 01:09:42,546
It ain't officially for sale yet, but
Bill Hale has seen to it for you.

845
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,070
Did you hear that, sweetheart?

846
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:48,160
This one. This one.

847
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:50,684
It's from a cow's pancreas.

848
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:55,123
- It'll come down to us - once a week.
- Mmm.

849
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:57,430
Look at that.

850
01:09:58,301 --> 01:10:02,435
Wow. A cow's pancreas.

851
01:10:03,523 --> 01:10:06,352
- Diabetes can be - an awful misery.
- Mmm.

852
01:10:07,658 --> 01:10:10,008
- Have you eaten - in the last hour?
- No.

853
01:10:10,182 --> 01:10:11,836
Lift your blouse, please.

854
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:13,620
There you go.

855
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,753
Have you had
anything to drink?

856
01:10:15,927 --> 01:10:19,104
Goat's milk. Hotcakes.

857
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,894
Well, she's had, uh...
taffy and bacon too. Go on. Tell 'em.

858
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,896
You gotta tell 'em.

859
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,117
If you don't stop eating sweets,
this won't matter.

860
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:35,425
You will lose your feet, or
worse, if you eat like a white.

861
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,253
Hear that?

862
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:41,431
It's all right.

863
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:44,521
Goddamn it.

864
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:48,525
Hey, Blackie, stop! Blackie!

865
01:10:48,526 --> 01:10:49,960
Oh, shit. Stop!

866
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:51,919
Goddamn it, Blackie!
Stop running!

867
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:53,965
- Where are you - gonna go to?
- You gotta catch me first!

868
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:56,054
Ooh, look at that.

869
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,065
Hey there.

870
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,504
You brought the Buick out, huh?

871
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:14,855
Get in. Get in.

872
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:37,835
Byron.

873
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:40,316
Brother, come here.

874
01:11:44,189 --> 01:11:45,712
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.

875
01:11:49,412 --> 01:11:50,848
Kneel, please, Ernest.

876
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:53,329
Kneel.

877
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:05,384
Did you make a deal
with Blackie Thompson

878
01:12:05,558 --> 01:12:08,996
to steal your red roadster
and cash the insurance?

879
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,044
Um...

880
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,047
I, um...

881
01:12:18,049 --> 01:12:19,529
Yes, I did.

882
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:23,707
Well, Blackie's been arrested
for stealing your car.

883
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,100
What were you supposed to do?

884
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:32,846
I was... I was supposed to feel
him out on, uh... on Bill and Reta.

885
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,632
So who takes care of Bill Smith
and his blanket now?

886
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,809
I... Hmm?

887
01:12:39,549 --> 01:12:40,985
I don't know, sir.

888
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:44,902
Remove the book.

889
01:12:45,555 --> 01:12:46,556
I...

890
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:53,606
I'm sorry.

891
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,348
All right, Brother. Stand up.

892
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,002
Stand up.

893
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,224
Elbows on the table.

894
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:22,026
I'm a 32nd degree Mason.

895
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,115
I am imbued

896
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:30,164
with confidence, trust and
responsibility, among other things.

897
01:13:31,122 --> 01:13:32,166
Yes, sir.

898
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:33,994
You know what that is?

899
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:36,997
No, sir.

900
01:13:38,129 --> 01:13:39,391
Shit!

901
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:49,096
Damn.

902
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,840
Now get up! Sit over there.

903
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:08,812
Are you challenged
to lead your house?

904
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:12,685
Mm-mmm. No.

905
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,254
She's hired
a private investigator

906
01:14:17,342 --> 01:14:20,040
who noses and brings
unwanted eyes.

907
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:26,394
She got the tribal council to pay for
Barney McBride's trip to Washington.

908
01:14:28,484 --> 01:14:30,921
- I know.
- She's a very hard-headed woman

909
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:33,053
and she's gonna make it
harder on you!

910
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:37,231
I'm sorry, King. You know
she's just... she's just stubborn.

911
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,235
Ernest, handsome son,

912
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:46,719
what do you think's gonna happen
to Mollie a-and all of them?

913
01:14:46,893 --> 01:14:49,679
I love 'em, but in the
turning of the earth,

914
01:14:50,418 --> 01:14:51,637
they're gonna go.

915
01:14:52,638 --> 01:14:54,248
Their time is over.

916
01:14:54,988 --> 01:14:57,164
That's it. Gone.

917
01:14:57,338 --> 01:15:01,212
Ernest, there will be no lightning
strike and it stops happening.

918
01:15:01,386 --> 01:15:03,083
It will happen.

919
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:07,044
These headrights
must go to Mollie,

920
01:15:07,218 --> 01:15:11,483
not to the mother, not to
the sister, Reta, not Bill Smith.

921
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,659
Yes, sir.

922
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:16,532
You've got to take back control
of your home.

923
01:15:20,623 --> 01:15:22,755
Now, you hear me, hmm?

924
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:26,106
- Yes, King.
- Hmm.

925
01:16:25,383 --> 01:16:27,820
<i>World champeen roper
Henry Grammer...</i>

926
01:16:27,994 --> 01:16:31,781
<i>...finest and biggest
moonshine dealer in the county.</i>

927
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,609
<i>Look at all that blue.</i>

928
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,828
<i>Is that gold, Henry?</i>

929
01:16:36,002 --> 01:16:38,352
Better than gold.
It's recognition.

930
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:40,572
Now, Henry,

931
01:16:40,746 --> 01:16:42,792
what I need is someone
who can do a job,

932
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:46,404
someone who can take a proposition
to do an old man and his blanket.

933
01:16:46,578 --> 01:16:49,799
And I just don't want any man. I
need someone who can do it right.

934
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:52,802
'Cause I need them both to go
at the same time.

935
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,674
So it can't be poison whiskey
or something like that.

936
01:16:55,848 --> 01:16:58,285
- It's gotta be foolproof.
- Mmm.

937
01:17:00,766 --> 01:17:02,376
- Hey, John?
- Yeah.

938
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,728
Take this on up the house,
stash it for me.

939
01:17:05,902 --> 01:17:07,294
Don't let Maggie see it.

940
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:09,775
Oh, now, she got eyes, Henry.

941
01:17:09,949 --> 01:17:12,109
She caught me last time,
and I don't want that woman...

942
01:17:12,256 --> 01:17:13,256
Give it to me.

943
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:16,826
Why don't y'all just go talk
to Blackie Thompson?

944
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,742
- Well...
- Blackie? Mmm.

945
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:22,962
Well, he's, uh... He's in...
in a penitentiary right now.

946
01:17:23,136 --> 01:17:24,311
Tell him why.

947
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:26,096
Um...

948
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,665
Well, I messed up and, uh...

949
01:17:29,839 --> 01:17:30,839
Go on. You tell him.

950
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:32,798
'Cause he had a harebrained idea

951
01:17:32,972 --> 01:17:35,801
to get him nabbed
on insurance money on his car.

952
01:17:35,975 --> 01:17:38,543
- That's bad luck.
- I'll say.

953
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:42,112
There's Dick Gregg.

954
01:17:42,286 --> 01:17:45,942
No. Dick's wanted in Arkansas.

955
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:49,336
Hell, he's wanted in Kansas.

956
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:51,687
Son of a bitch is so hid,
he can't even find himself.

957
01:17:55,647 --> 01:17:57,127
You need a yegg man...

958
01:17:59,303 --> 01:18:01,131
somebody,
if youse want explosives,

959
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:04,612
who'd make damn sure you get in
there and get them both, same time.

960
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:07,572
Soup under the house.

961
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:10,793
Nitro or dynamite.

962
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:13,317
Blow 'em up.

963
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,714
I think that'd be Acie Kirby.

964
01:18:18,888 --> 01:18:20,803
- Acie?
- Oh, yeah.

965
01:18:20,977 --> 01:18:22,848
- Where's he at?
- I don't really know.

966
01:18:23,022 --> 01:18:24,371
He's pretty squirrelly.

967
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:26,265
The son of a bitch right there
might though.

968
01:18:26,983 --> 01:18:28,854
- Hey, John?
- Yeah.

969
01:18:29,028 --> 01:18:31,727
Where's Acie Kirby hiding out
these days?

970
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:36,340
I don't rightly know. Hiding out in
his old hole somewhere, I suspect.

971
01:18:36,514 --> 01:18:38,474
Why don't you take your
skinny ass up to the barn,

972
01:18:38,559 --> 01:18:40,953
see if you can find a shovel
and go dig him up?

973
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:43,216
Mmm. Now?

974
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:46,089
All right. I'll ask around,
see if I can find him.

975
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:52,748
Acie Kirby.

976
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:05,064
Acie. That's your man.

977
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:27,478
Ready?

978
01:19:29,523 --> 01:19:30,655
Come on.

979
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:34,615
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Mrs. Burkhart.

980
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:36,617
Set up right here. All right.

981
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,583
Tsk, tsk.

982
01:19:51,676 --> 01:19:55,288
What?

983
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:19,747
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask
you to just step outside for me a minute...

984
01:20:19,922 --> 01:20:22,402
...while I speak to my wife.

985
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:23,926
- Outside?
- Of course, Ernest.

986
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,101
Just for a minute.

987
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,849
Well...

988
01:20:34,023 --> 01:20:36,677
What now? What now?

989
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,728
We need
the shots and the insulin.

990
01:20:43,902 --> 01:20:47,775
What then, Mollie? What?

991
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:55,609
All right.

992
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:58,656
All right, all right.

993
01:21:04,053 --> 01:21:07,360
So, fellas, uh, just give me that.
I'm gonna go ahead and do it.

994
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,275
You're administering the shot?

995
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:10,929
Yeah. Yeah.

996
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:13,063
Ernest, Bill Hale has
entrusted us with this care.

997
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:16,108
I know, I know. It's just the
way it's going right now, all right?

998
01:21:16,282 --> 01:21:18,458
We're still gonna
have to charge you for this visit.

999
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:20,808
We made the trip out here.
Gas, time...

1000
01:21:20,983 --> 01:21:23,899
Fuck a duck. You're gonna
charge me for this robbery? Is that it?

1001
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:26,031
It's only right.

1002
01:21:26,205 --> 01:21:27,815
Give me that.

1003
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:31,558
I'll get it back to you. Go on
now. Get outta here. Go on.

1004
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:35,084
Goddamn it.

1005
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:40,611
There you go.

1006
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,877
- Made me send the doctors away.
- The doctors.

1007
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:48,445
What, am I a doctor?
Are you a doctor?

1008
01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:50,939
Stupid, stubborn bitch ought
to let them men do their work.

1009
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:53,015
That's what you should do...

1010
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:54,549
So I'm the doctor now?

1011
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,453
I'm the doctor and the nurse

1012
01:21:56,627 --> 01:21:59,369
and the housekeeper, babysitter,
God knows what else all, right?

1013
01:21:59,543 --> 01:22:00,892
It's not helping.

1014
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,634
It's not any good.

1015
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:07,116
King Hale has gifted this
to you.

1016
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,639
He has gifted this. You...

1017
01:22:08,813 --> 01:22:10,728
Five people in the whole world
are getting this,

1018
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:12,730
and you're one of them, Mollie.

1019
01:22:12,904 --> 01:22:15,951
You're one of the lucky ones.
Think of the children.

1020
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,083
That's gonna save your life
right there.

1021
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:21,434
But no, no, you think
you know everything, right?

1022
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:23,654
With your...
With your Indian ways.

1023
01:22:23,828 --> 01:22:26,439
You think you're gonna get
better with all them medicine men

1024
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:28,653
and all them roots and all them
herbs and all the...

1025
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:31,401
All that horseshit?

1026
01:22:31,575 --> 01:22:33,055
You ain't, Mollie!

1027
01:22:33,794 --> 01:22:35,840
That's real medicine!

1028
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:49,114
You think... You think
someone's gonna hurt you?

1029
01:22:49,288 --> 01:22:51,987
You think... You think
I'm gonna hurt you?

1030
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,513
You don't say nothing to that?

1031
01:23:31,156 --> 01:23:33,680
Give it a chance now, all right?

1032
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:39,730
Maybe it's gotta get worse
before it gets better, Mollie.

1033
01:23:43,038 --> 01:23:46,084
I am to take care of you.

1034
01:23:46,258 --> 01:23:50,393
No one... No one is gonna
hurt you when I'm in front.

1035
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:14,373
Open. Ah. Ah.

1036
01:24:14,547 --> 01:24:16,071
How are you feeling, Henry?

1037
01:24:16,245 --> 01:24:19,074
Good.
Well, sometimes I feel sad.

1038
01:24:19,248 --> 01:24:21,206
That's not a health issue
for us.

1039
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:25,210
Oh, he's fit as a fiddle. Come
on, Henry, he's healthy as a horse.

1040
01:24:25,384 --> 01:24:29,040
That he is, Bill. So what are you
gonna do? You gonna kill this Indian?

1041
01:24:29,214 --> 01:24:30,346
How'd you know?

1042
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,653
Better watch out.

1043
01:24:35,481 --> 01:24:37,614
Well, no, he just needs
to be insured, that's all.

1044
01:24:37,788 --> 01:24:39,572
It's just a formality,
but he needs it.

1045
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:41,400
Well, what about my melancholy?

1046
01:24:41,574 --> 01:24:43,489
A little whiskey can help that.

1047
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:46,753
You better watch out.

1048
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,888
I don't know, Bill.
It may not look very good.

1049
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:53,586
It's hard to justify this one.

1050
01:24:54,892 --> 01:24:56,502
He owes me a lot of money.

1051
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:00,811
Bill, my guardian won't give me
what's mine.

1052
01:25:00,985 --> 01:25:01,986
What do you need?

1053
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,814
I wanna buy some moonshine.

1054
01:25:03,988 --> 01:25:06,077
No, no, Henry. You don't
need that stuff. It's hurting you.

1055
01:25:06,078 --> 01:25:07,198
Doctor said I should use it.

1056
01:25:07,252 --> 01:25:08,688
I don't care what he says.

1057
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:10,560
He don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

1058
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:11,822
- Come on, Henry.
- Hi, Pearl.

1059
01:25:11,996 --> 01:25:14,303
- My wife's on Roy Bunch.
- What?

1060
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:16,261
My wife's on Roy Bunch.

1061
01:25:16,435 --> 01:25:18,176
Who cares about Roy Bunch?

1062
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,548
You got women all over you,
my friend. You're lucky with that.

1063
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:24,748
And be at peace with what you
have. And don't do anything stupid.

1064
01:25:24,922 --> 01:25:26,010
I wanna hurt myself.

1065
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:27,925
That's not a man's way out.

1066
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:30,274
A man's to get what's his.
They won't give that to me.

1067
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:32,475
A wife's to give respect.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

1068
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,802
I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed
to be an Osage Indian.

1069
01:25:35,976 --> 01:25:38,457
Just give me some moonshine
or get me a gun.

1070
01:25:38,631 --> 01:25:41,286
Now, Henry... Now, Henry,
you have a good time with Pearl.

1071
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,245
Don't you do anything stupid,
you hear?

1072
01:25:43,419 --> 01:25:46,117
I need you, my friend.
I need you.

1073
01:25:52,776 --> 01:25:55,213
Henry, no! What you doing
here, Henry? Henry, no.

1074
01:25:57,998 --> 01:26:00,087
- What do you think - you're doing?
- Henry, stop it!

1075
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,048
- Think you can touch - my wife?
- Get him off me!

1076
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:06,268
You stay off my wife!
You stay off my wife!

1077
01:26:06,442 --> 01:26:08,357
I've done nothing to
you. You're the...

1078
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:11,534
I'm tired of asking friends for
things when I can pay my own way.

1079
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,797
Henry, you've got
to bring your guardian.

1080
01:26:13,798 --> 01:26:15,842
Who tells you how to spend
your own money?

1081
01:26:16,016 --> 01:26:17,844
Just stop, Henry.

1082
01:26:18,018 --> 01:26:20,020
My ancestors had a free life
before you got off your stinky boats.

1083
01:26:21,935 --> 01:26:23,937
You think
you're better than me, huh?

1084
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:26,157
- Think you're better than me?
- Come on.

1085
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:29,378
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You went and hit Roy Bunch. Come on.

1086
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:32,555
I knocked him down, Reverend
Hale. I knocked him down.

1087
01:26:39,823 --> 01:26:41,303
Why do you take care of him?

1088
01:26:41,477 --> 01:26:43,087
'Cause he's a melancholic.

1089
01:26:44,393 --> 01:26:46,482
You know he tried to do
away with himself last year?

1090
01:26:47,265 --> 01:26:48,265
Oh, yeah?

1091
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:49,789
I take care of that man

1092
01:26:49,963 --> 01:26:52,096
because he's my neighbor
and he's my best friend.

1093
01:26:53,228 --> 01:26:55,795
That's $25,000 laying there.

1094
01:26:57,232 --> 01:26:59,146
I got an insurance policy
on him.

1095
01:26:59,321 --> 01:27:01,540
It's against what he owes me.

1096
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:05,457
So, if he succeeds in demising himself
before the end of the year, I forfeit.

1097
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:07,111
Hmm.

1098
01:27:07,285 --> 01:27:09,722
So, he needs to stay alive
at least a few more months.

1099
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,466
I might even get a chance
at his headrights.

1100
01:27:16,947 --> 01:27:18,688
Something you should know...

1101
01:27:19,471 --> 01:27:21,386
Hmm?

1102
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,781
Mollie's first husband is that
man right there on the floor.

1103
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:29,916
What do you mean,
"first husband"?

1104
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:32,005
Osage, they don't divorce.

1105
01:27:32,179 --> 01:27:37,924
And they were. They were married
in a ceremony on the reservation.

1106
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:41,493
What do you mean? You... She...
You mean, she's still married to him?

1107
01:27:41,667 --> 01:27:45,105
No, no. They were 15. It's
traditional. Doesn't mean anything...

1108
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:49,066
If I was married, I'd be telling
her that. She didn't tell me that.

1109
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:51,895
How's she treatin' you?

1110
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,117
She treats me just fine.
She's a good one, you know.

1111
01:27:58,205 --> 01:28:00,556
Well, you let her have
her secrets.

1112
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,298
That way, you have yours.

1113
01:30:53,511 --> 01:30:55,208
<i>Is there anyone?</i>

1114
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:57,646
Pitts Beaty's trying
to get his Klan

1115
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,474
to find the killers
who killed Anna.

1116
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:06,916
He said they're... they're helping to
take the lazy men away from town.

1117
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:11,398
Well, Pitts and his Klan are trying to
have authority here, and they have none.

1118
01:31:11,573 --> 01:31:14,314
They need to let the police
do their job.

1119
01:31:14,489 --> 01:31:17,404
I'm very disapproving
of the Ku Klux Klan, Mollie.

1120
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:19,494
They're very hungry for a power.

1121
01:31:20,712 --> 01:31:23,149
- And they ain't gonna get it.
- Hmm.

1122
01:31:24,934 --> 01:31:26,370
Is there anyone?

1123
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,026
The tribe tried Barney McBride.

1124
01:31:33,899 --> 01:31:35,074
<i>He didn't come back.</i>

1125
01:31:39,296 --> 01:31:42,081
We hired a private investigator, but...

1126
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,090
You paid him?

1127
01:31:52,614 --> 01:31:55,704
- Yes.
- Well, he ran off, didn't he?

1128
01:31:55,878 --> 01:31:58,707
Ernest, he ran off.
Ernest, he ran off.

1129
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:00,709
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1130
01:32:00,883 --> 01:32:02,754
Seems that way, King.
Seems that way.

1131
01:32:02,928 --> 01:32:04,495
Seems that way. Mm-hmm.

1132
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:06,802
I think we should be
a little more considerate

1133
01:32:06,976 --> 01:32:10,022
about how we spend
Mollie's money, Ernest.

1134
01:32:10,196 --> 01:32:13,069
I don't mean that as a
criticism, I'm just saying.

1135
01:32:13,243 --> 01:32:15,071
You bought a farm. Yeah.

1136
01:32:15,245 --> 01:32:17,203
Okay. You didn't consult me.

1137
01:32:17,377 --> 01:32:20,119
Maybe you should've consulted me
because I'm there for you, Ernest.

1138
01:32:20,293 --> 01:32:21,730
I'm there for both of you.

1139
01:32:22,644 --> 01:32:24,471
You met Mollie because of me.

1140
01:32:24,646 --> 01:32:26,517
You're here because of me.

1141
01:32:26,691 --> 01:32:31,522
Let me help you. Let me give you
my advice, my consultation.

1142
01:32:31,696 --> 01:32:35,613
Judson, he didn't tell me about
a hog sickness that was going on,

1143
01:32:35,787 --> 01:32:40,575
but now... I learned my lesson,
King. Won't happen again.

1144
01:32:40,749 --> 01:32:44,317
Just a bad investment,
that's all. Bad investment.

1145
01:32:47,756 --> 01:32:48,757
Mollie?

1146
01:32:51,063 --> 01:32:53,805
There's something different
about you tonight. What is it?

1147
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:02,292
Uh... Well, now's a good a time
as any, so...

1148
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:09,212
- Mollie, she's pregnant.
- What?

1149
01:33:09,386 --> 01:33:10,779
- Oh!
- Oh!

1150
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:13,477
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, my...

1151
01:33:13,651 --> 01:33:15,218
Yeah? That so?

1152
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,436
Yeah.

1153
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:20,910
Oh, my goodness.

1154
01:33:20,919 --> 01:33:26,098
Yeah, we got the... We got the
news that Mollie's having a baby, King.

1155
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:29,754
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

1156
01:33:29,928 --> 01:33:32,627
Blessings.
Blessings upon this house.

1157
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:34,629
- Wonderful. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1158
01:33:34,803 --> 01:33:35,803
Bless you.

1159
01:33:35,891 --> 01:33:37,501
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1160
01:33:37,675 --> 01:33:39,524
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

1161
01:33:39,525 --> 01:33:41,445
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1162
01:33:42,941 --> 01:33:44,551
We are just thrilled.

1163
01:33:44,726 --> 01:33:46,553
Thank you, Willie.

1164
01:33:46,728 --> 01:33:50,470
Henry! Oh, Henry. Come on in here.
We just got some wonderful news.

1165
01:33:50,645 --> 01:33:54,649
Mollie is pregnant again.

1166
01:33:54,823 --> 01:33:58,174
I have a feeling it's a girl. I
am never wrong about these things.

1167
01:33:58,348 --> 01:33:59,784
Congratulations.

1168
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:02,091
I can feel it
in my bones.

1169
01:34:02,265 --> 01:34:05,181
...a baby quilt.
We'll pick out colors. We'll go to...

1170
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:07,139
Congratulations.

1171
01:34:07,313 --> 01:34:09,272
We'll go
to the dry goods store...

1172
01:34:09,446 --> 01:34:10,926
Sorry to bother you.

1173
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,260
Uncle, I just need to have
some words with you, please.

1174
01:34:13,276 --> 01:34:15,876
Of course, Henry. You just go
sit over there. I'll be right there.

1175
01:34:16,018 --> 01:34:17,236
I just gotta talk to them.

1176
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:19,369
- You go.
- Wait for me there. - Thank you.

1177
01:34:27,551 --> 01:34:30,467
You been loving with her
in this sickness?

1178
01:34:32,034 --> 01:34:38,736
She's my wife, King.
It's, uh... That's what happens. Yeah.

1179
01:34:41,304 --> 01:34:44,220
Mmm, maybe it's just
a "preversion" of yours.

1180
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:50,792
Yeah. God bless you
and the child.

1181
01:35:01,933 --> 01:35:03,369
First husband, huh?

1182
01:35:05,632 --> 01:35:08,331
You think that means
he's got a claim on the family?

1183
01:35:22,084 --> 01:35:23,085
Henry.

1184
01:35:23,825 --> 01:35:25,391
Uncle.

1185
01:35:25,565 --> 01:35:28,873
<i>Ramsey, I know
you're in bad way in this life.</i>

1186
01:35:29,047 --> 01:35:32,747
Lots of kids. Seven or eight,
I heard.

1187
01:35:32,921 --> 01:35:34,966
Yeah, I got a passel of 'em,
don't I?

1188
01:35:36,751 --> 01:35:39,623
King Bill Hale wants to know
if you'd like a job

1189
01:35:40,363 --> 01:35:42,060
getting someone done.

1190
01:35:42,234 --> 01:35:45,847
Oh, I can't do that. I didn't
sign on for that kind of work.

1191
01:35:47,065 --> 01:35:48,501
Well, it's an Indian.

1192
01:35:49,894 --> 01:35:51,287
Now, that's different.

1193
01:35:52,549 --> 01:35:53,550
You know Henry Roan?

1194
01:35:53,724 --> 01:35:55,247
Nah, I don't know him.

1195
01:35:57,336 --> 01:35:59,338
Well, what you think?

1196
01:36:02,515 --> 01:36:05,344
Lookee here.
I'm gonna take you right now.

1197
01:36:05,518 --> 01:36:09,087
I'm gonna buy you a roadster so you
can drive around and do this for him.

1198
01:36:09,261 --> 01:36:12,438
It's gonna take a lot more than a
roadster to get me out of the bind I'm in.

1199
01:36:12,612 --> 01:36:14,397
Well, we'll work something out.

1200
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:16,660
I hope you don't rumble
over this killing neither.

1201
01:36:16,834 --> 01:36:19,271
The Indian, he's...
He's a melancholic.

1202
01:36:19,445 --> 01:36:21,273
He's tried to do away
with himself twice't already.

1203
01:36:21,274 --> 01:36:23,536
That's what Hale's been saying.

1204
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:27,497
He even wants you to make it
like Roan did it to himself.

1205
01:36:27,671 --> 01:36:32,154
In the front of the head, you
understand? Front of the head.

1206
01:36:59,007 --> 01:37:00,965
Knights come marching in.
That's it, Pitts.

1207
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:03,228
Hey, Ernest.

1208
01:37:09,974 --> 01:37:13,195
<i>So Ernest had me meet this
Indian over at a restaurant in Fairfax.</i>

1209
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,414
- John.
- John Ramsey. John Ramsey.

1210
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:17,590
- Henry. It's a pleasure.
- How you doing?

1211
01:37:17,764 --> 01:37:20,637
<i>He sat down beside me, and I
smelled whiskey on his breath.</i>

1212
01:37:20,811 --> 01:37:22,813
...you might be in the market
for a little hooch?

1213
01:37:22,987 --> 01:37:24,293
<i>I told him
I could sell him some.</i>

1214
01:37:24,467 --> 01:37:26,556
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm the man to see for that.

1215
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:30,081
<i>I told him to meet me out on the road
running through Sol Smith's pasture</i>

1216
01:37:30,255 --> 01:37:32,040
<i>about ten o'clock.</i>

1217
01:37:32,214 --> 01:37:36,131
Whoo-hoo. Partner. Look what I
done found in the possum hole.

1218
01:37:47,882 --> 01:37:53,104
Come on. Don't be
stingy, now. - Yeah.

1219
01:37:56,455 --> 01:37:59,067
Mmm. Oh.

1220
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:03,506
Boy, that'll make your liver
turn inside out.

1221
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:10,208
<i>A few times after I met this Indian,
well, we kind of got to liking one another,</i>

1222
01:38:10,382 --> 01:38:13,037
<i>what with his troubles
being respected and all.</i>

1223
01:38:13,211 --> 01:38:15,605
<i>And then sometimes
we'd go to Mrs. Mackie's place.</i>

1224
01:38:15,779 --> 01:38:17,607
So he took it.
Can you imagine that?

1225
01:38:17,781 --> 01:38:20,610
What kind of sheriff goes around
selling cocaine? You tell me that.

1226
01:38:20,784 --> 01:38:22,177
Don't you tell me that.

1227
01:38:22,351 --> 01:38:25,310
<i>This went on for a while.</i>

1228
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:28,531
<i>I was trying to rib up
a little more courage,</i>

1229
01:38:28,705 --> 01:38:33,318
<i>and one day I decided to pull
the job, everything being favorable.</i>

1230
01:38:33,492 --> 01:38:37,888
<i>So I told this Indian
we get us a jug and some girls</i>

1231
01:38:38,062 --> 01:38:41,022
<i>and meet me out on the road
running through Smith's pasture.</i>

1232
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:43,720
Trust me, this is better
than the last stuff we had.

1233
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:22,063
Goddamn.

1234
01:39:23,325 --> 01:39:25,980
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, yeah. Watch Cowboy for me.

1235
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:33,551
What? What is it?

1236
01:39:33,683 --> 01:39:34,989
Where's Hale?

1237
01:39:35,163 --> 01:39:38,166
I don't know.
Whizbang, Pawhuska. What?

1238
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:40,037
Tell him it's done.

1239
01:39:40,864 --> 01:39:42,822
You did it? You did it where?

1240
01:39:42,997 --> 01:39:46,391
Out on the road running through
Sol Smith's pasture. And that's it.

1241
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:48,741
Take this.
I don't want it no more.

1242
01:39:48,915 --> 01:39:50,656
- John.
- I'm done with this outfit.

1243
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:02,146
Henry Roan's dead.

1244
01:40:11,286 --> 01:40:12,722
Did he kill himself?

1245
01:40:14,115 --> 01:40:15,594
Don't know.

1246
01:40:20,164 --> 01:40:22,166
He was always sad.

1247
01:40:24,038 --> 01:40:25,126
Always.

1248
01:40:28,216 --> 01:40:29,695
You knew him well, right?

1249
01:40:31,088 --> 01:40:32,742
Since we were children.

1250
01:40:38,139 --> 01:40:41,751
Does your uncle know?
They were friends.

1251
01:40:41,925 --> 01:40:45,146
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He knows.

1252
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:49,976
Was he murdered?

1253
01:40:53,719 --> 01:40:54,894
Don't know.

1254
01:40:56,679 --> 01:41:01,684
He tried
to kill himself last year.

1255
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:05,427
Did you know that?

1256
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:07,385
Mm-hmm.

1257
01:41:12,825 --> 01:41:17,091
Was he murdered or did
he kill himself? Do you know?

1258
01:41:17,961 --> 01:41:19,093
I...

1259
01:41:20,137 --> 01:41:21,399
I don't know.

1260
01:41:24,272 --> 01:41:29,320
You know, Roy Bunch, he was
making a lot of noise about killing him.

1261
01:41:29,494 --> 01:41:32,106
You know, he's on his wife,
so...

1262
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,238
...don't need to look
too far, right?

1263
01:41:36,545 --> 01:41:40,592
Maybe he, uh, just killed
himself, you know, like you said.

1264
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,208
It was supposed to be a suicide,
you dumbbell.

1265
01:41:47,382 --> 01:41:48,948
You didn't tell him
to leave the gun?

1266
01:41:49,123 --> 01:41:50,906
I told him to leave the gun.
I told him exac...

1267
01:41:50,907 --> 01:41:53,170
- You told him - to leave the gun?
- Just like you told me, King.

1268
01:41:53,171 --> 01:41:55,085
I don't know why he didn't.
I don't know why.

1269
01:41:55,259 --> 01:41:57,522
I told him
just like you told me.

1270
01:41:57,696 --> 01:41:59,394
You told him to do it
in the front of the head?

1271
01:41:59,395 --> 01:42:01,222
Then why'd he do it in the back?

1272
01:42:01,396 --> 01:42:03,920
It's so simple. The front is
the front, the back is the back!

1273
01:42:04,094 --> 01:42:06,357
Ma... He has to make it look
like he done it himself!

1274
01:42:06,531 --> 01:42:10,013
It just looks like murder. It's not
supposed to be that way, you hear?

1275
01:42:10,187 --> 01:42:13,582
I told him the front of the head.
Just like this. Just like you told me.

1276
01:42:13,756 --> 01:42:15,800
I promise you. I promise you.
I swear on my children.

1277
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:18,978
- Don't do that.
- Calm down. Settle down. - I swear on my children, King.

1278
01:42:19,153 --> 01:42:21,851
And don't swear on your
children. Makes you look foolish.

1279
01:42:22,025 --> 01:42:25,028
I ain't. I ain't foolish
'cause I've done it right.

1280
01:42:30,468 --> 01:42:31,861
What is this, King?

1281
01:42:32,775 --> 01:42:33,950
'Fraid lights.

1282
01:42:35,169 --> 01:42:37,475
They're putting up lights
to keep the murder away.

1283
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:48,356
Go, go, go.

1284
01:43:01,107 --> 01:43:03,806
There he is.
Pull up the car.

1285
01:43:04,589 --> 01:43:06,330
Hey, Roy! Roy!

1286
01:43:11,944 --> 01:43:14,817
This is not the place
you should be at right now.

1287
01:43:14,991 --> 01:43:17,428
And I have a line
that says you should leave town,

1288
01:43:17,602 --> 01:43:21,040
'cause the sheriff's office is
looking to charge you in this killing.

1289
01:43:21,215 --> 01:43:23,478
They know you was
on shooting terms with Henry.

1290
01:43:24,914 --> 01:43:28,787
If I run, I'm guilty. I ain't got
nothing to be guilty about.

1291
01:43:28,961 --> 01:43:30,876
If you run...

1292
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:34,576
You don't run, you're gonna go to
prison for this, you done it or not.

1293
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:39,320
Just... Just my friendly word.
I would run.

1294
01:43:39,494 --> 01:43:42,671
Thank you, Bill.
I don't think I will.

1295
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,327
And you're not my friend.

1296
01:43:47,589 --> 01:43:49,634
Take my chances
right here in Fairfax.

1297
01:44:04,175 --> 01:44:09,514
You are of the Elder Sky People.

1298
01:44:10,723 --> 01:44:12,224
Little Anna...

1299
01:44:12,225 --> 01:44:16,145
...your name is Wah hre lum pa.

1300
01:44:27,846 --> 01:44:30,545
<i>What is
this wasting illness, Mollie?</i>

1301
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:35,463
<i>Wasting? Wasting away?</i>

1302
01:44:37,682 --> 01:44:39,205
<i>Minnie died from it.</i>

1303
01:44:40,729 --> 01:44:42,513
<i>Momma died from it too.</i>

1304
01:44:43,862 --> 01:44:45,342
<i>Anna was shot.</i>

1305
01:44:52,654 --> 01:44:55,221
<i>This blanket is
a target on our backs.</i>

1306
01:45:27,776 --> 01:45:31,170
Why don't we just leave?
Go to Colorado Springs.

1307
01:45:31,345 --> 01:45:35,479
Look at me.
I can't make that trip.

1308
01:45:36,698 --> 01:45:39,048
How are you being
taken care of, Mollie?

1309
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:41,833
I have Ernest and my children.

1310
01:45:43,313 --> 01:45:47,012
- Ernest takes care of me.
- The best he can.

1311
01:45:47,186 --> 01:45:48,753
- Nettie?
- Yes.

1312
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:50,799
Can you get my sister
some toast, please?

1313
01:45:50,973 --> 01:45:53,497
- Of course. And a bit more coffee too?
- Thank you.

1314
01:45:54,535 --> 01:45:55,452
Little sister.

1315
01:46:01,462 --> 01:46:02,854
Thank you.

1316
01:46:15,476 --> 01:46:18,000
So you and Mollie
staying in town now too, huh?

1317
01:46:18,174 --> 01:46:19,567
Yeah, we're here now, so...

1318
01:46:25,616 --> 01:46:26,661
Hmm.

1319
01:46:29,054 --> 01:46:32,362
You made a nice place
for yourself, Bill. Real nice.

1320
01:46:32,536 --> 01:46:36,018
Thank you, Ernest. Shoun
brothers gave us a sweet deal

1321
01:46:36,192 --> 01:46:38,586
and they left some nice things
here for us too.

1322
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:40,762
Is that right?

1323
01:46:40,936 --> 01:46:44,548
Well, not nearly as nice as what you've
been buying but good enough for us.

1324
01:46:45,462 --> 01:46:46,942
Well, you know Mollie.

1325
01:46:47,116 --> 01:46:50,424
She likes her nice things, so...

1326
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:54,471
Not as much as you do.

1327
01:46:56,995 --> 01:47:01,739
Almost sounded to me like you...
...you was calling me a squaw man, Bill.

1328
01:47:01,913 --> 01:47:05,308
Oh, now, Ernest, that's something
I'd never call another man.

1329
01:47:05,482 --> 01:47:06,570
Right, right.

1330
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:09,225
No offense taken.

1331
01:47:14,099 --> 01:47:15,274
You need a drink?

1332
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:20,105
Yeah. I'll take a drink
if you got one.

1333
01:47:21,585 --> 01:47:22,586
No.

1334
01:47:25,197 --> 01:47:26,808
Then why di'ya ask?

1335
01:47:27,678 --> 01:47:29,985
Well, you seem nervous,
that's all.

1336
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:35,512
See, the thing is, Bill, I
ain't got no nerves. None at all.

1337
01:47:39,473 --> 01:47:41,866
It's just that I don't like
talking to you.

1338
01:47:42,824 --> 01:47:44,260
That's mostly it.

1339
01:47:46,305 --> 01:47:48,438
Well, have I done something
to bother you, Ernest?

1340
01:47:48,612 --> 01:47:51,789
Something that's bothering me?
No, no. Just...

1341
01:47:51,963 --> 01:47:55,924
Just the way you are that
bothers me. That's what it is.

1342
01:47:57,316 --> 01:48:01,277
Well, Lord made me, Ernest.
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

1343
01:48:01,451 --> 01:48:03,105
No. There ain't.

1344
01:48:04,498 --> 01:48:05,890
Unless you aim to kill me.

1345
01:48:06,717 --> 01:48:08,502
Or is that
your big brother's job?

1346
01:48:18,599 --> 01:48:21,863
Mollie?
It's time to go, sweetheart.

1347
01:48:22,907 --> 01:48:24,126
- Jim?
<i>- Myrtle?</i>

1348
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:25,867
If you have anything special
in the house,

1349
01:48:25,868 --> 01:48:27,738
get it out as soon as possible.

1350
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:29,914
Okay.

1351
01:48:32,526 --> 01:48:33,527
David?

1352
01:48:46,104 --> 01:48:47,541
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1353
01:48:47,715 --> 01:48:49,760
I'm off to Fort Worth
for the Stock Show,

1354
01:48:49,934 --> 01:48:53,155
but I want you to find Acie Kirby
and tell him it's time on the Smith job.

1355
01:48:55,549 --> 01:48:57,942
- Mmm.
- You hear me?

1356
01:48:58,116 --> 01:49:03,469
I just don't know him.
I... I don't know Acie Kirby. Wh...

1357
01:49:03,644 --> 01:49:05,123
Where does he find Acie?

1358
01:49:05,297 --> 01:49:07,430
Just find John Ramsey.
He'll know.

1359
01:49:07,604 --> 01:49:11,390
You got that? Find John Ramsey.
Tell Ramsey to tell Acie it's time.

1360
01:49:11,565 --> 01:49:12,957
We're off to Fort Worth.

1361
01:49:15,743 --> 01:49:17,571
We're off to Fort Worth.

1362
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:22,227
Look at me
like this makes sense.

1363
01:49:22,401 --> 01:49:28,233
I am. I understand. I'll
find Ramsey and I'll tell him.

1364
01:49:28,407 --> 01:49:29,800
Okay.

1365
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,157
- Uh, John?
- Yeah, that's me.

1366
01:49:39,331 --> 01:49:41,551
I got a message for you
from King Hale.

1367
01:49:41,725 --> 01:49:43,205
He wants you to find Acie Kirby

1368
01:49:43,379 --> 01:49:45,499
and tell him to take care
of Bill and Reta, all right?

1369
01:49:45,555 --> 01:49:48,776
- It's time now, John.
- I can't do it right now. My wife's sick.

1370
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:51,605
Well, my wife's sick too.
My wife's sick too.

1371
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:53,824
Why don't you do it?

1372
01:49:53,998 --> 01:49:56,087
Why are you always trying to get
somebody like me to do your work for you?

1373
01:49:56,088 --> 01:49:59,830
Well, 'cause I don't know...
I don't know Acie Kirby.

1374
01:50:00,004 --> 01:50:02,180
I don't know
what he looks like even, right?

1375
01:50:02,354 --> 01:50:05,488
I would do it, but I can't do it 'cause I
don't know what he looks like, John.

1376
01:50:05,662 --> 01:50:07,185
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

1377
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:09,797
All right. I'll do it,
but I can't do it right now.

1378
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:11,842
You can't get to it right now,
so you know,

1379
01:50:12,016 --> 01:50:14,536
this needs to be done straightaway,
not to wait on it, for Hale.

1380
01:50:14,671 --> 01:50:16,630
It has to be done straightaway.
Right now.

1381
01:50:16,804 --> 01:50:18,980
You know, you're being
mighty pushy, Ernest.

1382
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:21,786
- I gotta get back to work.
- Let me tell you something.

1383
01:50:21,787 --> 01:50:24,420
You got one more chance, John.
This is it. One more chance.

1384
01:50:24,594 --> 01:50:27,336
I'ma talk to King Hale. I'ma tell
him you're gonna do it right now.

1385
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:29,251
I don't wanna lose this job.

1386
01:50:29,425 --> 01:50:31,688
John, you ain't got no choice!
It's time.

1387
01:50:33,255 --> 01:50:35,736
- Tryin' to be nice to you now.
- I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fix it.

1388
01:50:35,737 --> 01:50:37,563
I'm tryin' to be nice
to you, John!

1389
01:50:37,738 --> 01:50:40,436
- I'm doing it. I said I'm gonna do it.
- Yeah, you best do it.

1390
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:41,959
Right now, John. Right now.

1391
01:50:52,448 --> 01:50:55,277
Acie. Acie.

1392
01:50:55,973 --> 01:50:56,974
Yeah.

1393
01:50:57,148 --> 01:50:59,498
It's John. Don't shoot.

1394
01:51:08,464 --> 01:51:09,857
You got your soup with you?

1395
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:18,517
Momma! Mommy!

1396
01:51:18,692 --> 01:51:20,128
Where were you, huh?

1397
01:51:20,302 --> 01:51:21,520
I was at Reta's.

1398
01:51:21,695 --> 01:51:23,609
Well, you're supposed
to be home.

1399
01:51:24,567 --> 01:51:25,611
Come on.

1400
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:32,053
- Cowboy had an earache.
- Oh, boy. Really?

1401
01:51:32,227 --> 01:51:35,752
And you know Bill ain't too
kind to Reta when I'm not there.

1402
01:51:37,841 --> 01:51:40,365
Listen, Mollie,
I... I...

1403
01:51:40,539 --> 01:51:43,499
I don't want you going out so much
right now, with all that's going on.

1404
01:51:46,178 --> 01:51:48,222
But I was just at my sister's.

1405
01:51:48,472 --> 01:51:50,975
You and the kids stay
in the house.

1406
01:51:51,725 --> 01:51:53,988
All right?

1407
01:52:17,968 --> 01:52:21,363
- Oh, Lord!
- What was that? What was that?

1408
01:52:21,537 --> 01:52:23,408
I don't know! I don't know.

1409
01:52:23,582 --> 01:52:25,106
- Vera!
- Oh, Lord.

1410
01:52:25,759 --> 01:52:26,890
Vera!

1411
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:30,154
Lizzie!

1412
01:52:30,328 --> 01:52:33,157
- What happened?
- Cowboy to Mommy.

1413
01:52:36,726 --> 01:52:39,990
This is just like Tulsa.
It's just like Tulsa.

1414
01:52:40,164 --> 01:52:41,904
<i>Careful,
there's glass everywhere!</i>

1415
01:52:41,905 --> 01:52:44,015
<i>Where the hell
did that come from?</i>

1416
01:52:44,016 --> 01:52:46,127
Whose house is it?

1417
01:52:47,171 --> 01:52:48,738
Whose house is it?

1418
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:51,132
It's Bill and Reta's!

1419
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:52,916
Bill and Reta's house.

1420
01:53:09,933 --> 01:53:11,493
Nettie stays in the back room,
that way!

1421
01:53:11,543 --> 01:53:12,980
Nettie's
back there!

1422
01:53:13,154 --> 01:53:14,546
Nettie Berkshire!
She lives here!

1423
01:53:14,547 --> 01:53:15,765
Nettie!

1424
01:53:15,939 --> 01:53:18,289
- Nettie!
- That's Bill Smith!

1425
01:53:18,463 --> 01:53:22,337
Shoot me! Shoot me!
Shoot me, goddamn it!

1426
01:53:22,511 --> 01:53:25,035
Shoot me!

1427
01:53:26,689 --> 01:53:29,561
It's Reta!
Reta's over here!

1428
01:53:30,693 --> 01:53:32,782
It's Reta, come on! It's Reta!

1429
01:53:37,526 --> 01:53:40,746
- Can you hear me, Reta?
- Reta. Reta. Reta.

1430
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,532
Reta.

1431
01:53:54,804 --> 01:53:56,501
I think she's dead.

1432
01:54:04,858 --> 01:54:10,994
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1433
01:54:11,168 --> 01:54:15,129
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1434
01:54:15,303 --> 01:54:18,045
Mommy! Mommy!

1435
01:54:36,193 --> 01:54:39,675
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

1436
01:54:40,806 --> 01:54:41,938
Ernest?

1437
01:55:09,618 --> 01:55:12,969
<i>Welcome to the
Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo.</i>

1438
01:55:13,143 --> 01:55:17,626
<i>We invite you to head on over to ring 1
and meet rodeo champion Henry Grammer.</i>

1439
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,280
<i>Get your autographs, be seen,</i>

1440
01:55:19,454 --> 01:55:21,978
<i>and talk with the man
up over there in ring 1.</i>

1441
01:55:35,992 --> 01:55:37,211
Too much dynamite.

1442
01:55:51,138 --> 01:55:55,359
You know, you're pronouncing
yourself too much, Bill.

1443
01:56:03,715 --> 01:56:05,369
Nettie, the maid.

1444
01:56:06,283 --> 01:56:08,938
They're still finding
pieces of her.

1445
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:18,426
Mollie Burkhart, incompetent.
Allotment number 285.

1446
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,124
Three, two, one.

1447
01:56:22,473 --> 01:56:26,825
<i>You want $300
to go to Washington, D.C.?</i>

1448
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,479
Yes.

1449
01:56:28,653 --> 01:56:31,395
Well, that's a hard trip
for an ailing woman, Mollie.

1450
01:56:32,614 --> 01:56:36,226
<i>And I can't let you have
this money or make this trip.</i>

1451
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,577
<i>That would do a disservice
to you and your children.</i>

1452
01:56:40,264 --> 01:56:44,518
I want to go now because I
will not be alive much longer.

1453
01:56:46,497 --> 01:56:48,717
This may be the last thing I do.

1454
01:57:11,696 --> 01:57:13,394
It's nice to see you.
Thank you, Chief.

1455
01:57:13,568 --> 01:57:15,570
Thank you for your... Chief Bonnicastle.

1456
01:57:17,267 --> 01:57:19,443
President
Coolidge, ladies and gentlemen,

1457
01:57:19,444 --> 01:57:20,444
please, look this way.

1458
01:57:20,618 --> 01:57:22,577
Three, two, one.

1459
01:57:24,318 --> 01:57:27,886
Mr. President, Mollie Burkhart.
Please send help.

1460
01:57:28,061 --> 01:57:31,107
There's murder in Osage,
and the police do nothing.

1461
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:34,545
I lost my mother and my sisters.

1462
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:37,548
So many Osage are killed
for the oil money. Please.

1463
01:57:38,332 --> 01:57:39,463
Yes.

1464
01:57:39,637 --> 01:57:40,638
Thank you.

1465
01:57:45,556 --> 01:57:46,601
Thank you so much.

1466
01:57:52,998 --> 01:57:55,262
Keep giving
your wife her insulin...

1467
01:57:57,264 --> 01:58:00,310
and, uh, add this.

1468
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,662
That's this whole vial.

1469
01:58:06,055 --> 01:58:08,840
Now, make sure you get
the balance right, Ernest.

1470
01:58:09,014 --> 01:58:11,104
Now, you keep the shots regular.

1471
01:58:12,105 --> 01:58:13,802
It's just to slow her down.

1472
01:58:13,976 --> 01:58:16,021
That's all
it's gonna do. Slow her down.

1473
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:17,902
Mm-hmm.
That's all it'll do.

1474
01:58:18,067 --> 01:58:21,114
Same time every
day, 30 minutes before a meal.

1475
01:58:21,288 --> 01:58:22,811
The whole vial.

1476
01:58:31,733 --> 01:58:34,823
Ernest,
you believe in the Bible?

1477
01:58:37,565 --> 01:58:40,655
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Miracles of old?

1478
01:58:40,829 --> 01:58:41,960
Mmm.

1479
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:45,747
Expecting a miracle
to make all this go away?

1480
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:51,056
- Mm-mmm.
- You know they don't happen anymore.

1481
01:58:54,277 --> 01:58:55,322
I know.

1482
01:58:56,714 --> 01:59:00,979
I know, King. She's, uh...
She's gone to Washington, so...

1483
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:07,464
Just gotta...
s... slow her down, right?

1484
01:59:08,117 --> 01:59:09,117
Yep.

1485
01:59:09,249 --> 01:59:11,120
Just gonna slow her down some.

1486
01:59:26,266 --> 01:59:28,311
I'm afraid, <i>Sho-meen-kah.</i>

1487
01:59:30,226 --> 01:59:31,662
What are you afraid of?

1488
01:59:35,492 --> 01:59:37,973
I'm afraid to eat in my house.

1489
01:59:39,931 --> 01:59:42,891
Why are you afraid
to eat in your own house?

1490
01:59:45,449 --> 01:59:46,171
I'm afraid.

1491
01:59:49,724 --> 01:59:53,206
Do you have any
idea who might want to harm you?

1492
02:00:05,609 --> 02:00:10,310
<i>I wanna bring the upstairs
bed down, into the back room.</i>

1493
02:00:13,008 --> 02:00:17,969
<i>We will eat food only
made by Vera, no one else.</i>

1494
02:00:24,889 --> 02:00:27,457
<i>Baby Anna is sick
with whooping cough.</i>

1495
02:00:29,024 --> 02:00:30,199
<i>She needs care.</i>

1496
02:00:33,507 --> 02:00:35,907
<i>I want her to live with
Brother and Sister Bigheart.</i>

1497
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:42,951
<i>This will make her better.
It'll cure her cough.</i>

1498
02:00:43,125 --> 02:00:45,736
Mommy!

1499
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:50,611
Ernest, you pick up my insulin
from the train, you alone.

1500
02:00:51,612 --> 02:00:54,092
Do not take it
from the Shoun brothers.

1501
02:00:55,877 --> 02:00:57,966
<i>Yes, Mollie.</i>

1502
02:01:44,926 --> 02:01:49,887
My mother came to me.
She asked me to dance with her.

1503
02:01:51,454 --> 02:01:55,545
I told her
I can't dance anymore.

1504
02:02:03,292 --> 02:02:05,425
She told me I was dying.

1505
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:11,387
She didn't want me to die alone.

1506
02:02:15,522 --> 02:02:18,307
Well, dreams, they can
make you feel like dying...

1507
02:02:22,137 --> 02:02:26,707
...for just a little while,
and then... then you come back.

1508
02:02:27,751 --> 02:02:29,144
Hmm?

1509
02:02:32,495 --> 02:02:34,410
She said the man is here.

1510
02:02:36,847 --> 02:02:37,935
What man?

1511
02:02:39,676 --> 02:02:41,156
The man in the hat.

1512
02:02:42,418 --> 02:02:45,290
- Hmm.
- I wanna talk to the man in the hat.

1513
02:02:46,944 --> 02:02:51,122
Well, there's a lot of
fellas with hats, right?

1514
02:02:58,826 --> 02:03:00,262
Shh.

1515
02:03:03,178 --> 02:03:09,184
Shh, shh, shh.

1516
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:18,802
You just rest.

1517
02:03:42,565 --> 02:03:43,697
Mr. Burkhart?

1518
02:03:44,872 --> 02:03:46,439
Who is that?

1519
02:03:46,613 --> 02:03:49,311
My name's Tom White. I'm with
the Bureau of Investigation.

1520
02:03:59,887 --> 02:04:01,062
How do you do?

1521
02:04:01,236 --> 02:04:04,065
Bureau... What? What is that?

1522
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:08,504
Oh, I was sent down from Washington,
D.C., to see about these murders.

1523
02:04:10,201 --> 02:04:13,988
Hmm. To see...
see what about 'em?

1524
02:04:15,598 --> 02:04:16,773
See who's doing it.

1525
02:04:18,296 --> 02:04:19,472
Mmm.

1526
02:04:20,429 --> 02:04:22,692
You a detective? Mmm.

1527
02:04:22,866 --> 02:04:26,522
- You a Pinkerton? What are you?
- No, sir, I was a Texas Ranger.

1528
02:04:26,696 --> 02:04:28,872
I'm now with
the federal government.

1529
02:04:29,046 --> 02:04:31,135
It's called
the Bureau of Investigation.

1530
02:04:31,309 --> 02:04:32,876
Um...

1531
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:34,965
I tell you what,
if you got questions...

1532
02:04:35,139 --> 02:04:38,012
If you got questions, uh,
y'all go talk to the sheriff.

1533
02:04:38,186 --> 02:04:40,470
He can probably tell you
what you need to know.

1534
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:42,756
Oh, yes, sir, I have, uh...
I talked to him.

1535
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:49,240
But I'm here to speak with Mollie Burkhart
whose... whose sisters and mother is dead.

1536
02:04:49,414 --> 02:04:55,072
Yeah, Mollie? Yeah, no, she's
my... She's my wife.

1537
02:04:58,119 --> 02:05:02,819
She's... She's sick, real sick right now.
I'm... I'm her husband Ernest Burkhart, so...

1538
02:05:03,994 --> 02:05:05,300
You can call on her
another time.

1539
02:05:05,474 --> 02:05:07,234
But right now,
I don't know what to tell you.

1540
02:05:07,302 --> 02:05:09,304
She's not doing too well, so...

1541
02:05:11,219 --> 02:05:12,655
How's tomorrow?

1542
02:05:12,829 --> 02:05:15,484
Tomorrow? Well, it's... That...
That's too soon.

1543
02:05:15,658 --> 02:05:20,184
It's just... ...like I
said, she's not... not doing too well.

1544
02:05:20,358 --> 02:05:23,666
But you can come back... Come
back on Friday, how about that?

1545
02:05:25,059 --> 02:05:26,277
Well, is she home right now?

1546
02:05:27,496 --> 02:05:28,802
Well, she... she...

1547
02:05:30,064 --> 02:05:32,675
She got the diabetes,
you understand? Yeah.

1548
02:05:32,849 --> 02:05:35,069
- Oh, does she?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1549
02:05:35,243 --> 02:05:38,246
She's resting right now,
and I'm caring for her, so...

1550
02:05:39,552 --> 02:05:42,424
Well, you come back on Friday,
all right?

1551
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:45,340
- Friday?
- Yeah. Friday.

1552
02:05:45,514 --> 02:05:47,647
I'll do that. Thank you, sir.

1553
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:13,629
This is John Wren.
Friend of Cousin Mary.

1554
02:06:13,803 --> 02:06:15,370
He's come looking for family.

1555
02:06:17,459 --> 02:06:19,568
- - Welcome to Osage country.
- Thank you.

1556
02:06:21,245 --> 02:06:23,117
Welcome to Fairfax.

1557
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:25,075
Welcome to Wahzhazhe land.

1558
02:06:25,249 --> 02:06:28,513
Yeah, thank you. I've been told I
have Osage relations in Hominy.

1559
02:06:29,384 --> 02:06:30,385
Where are you from?

1560
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:48,185
I gotta talk to you, King.
Gotta talk to you. Sorry about that.

1561
02:06:48,186 --> 02:06:49,752
- Not now.
- No, I can't wait.

1562
02:06:49,926 --> 02:06:51,817
I gotta talk to you... You're
gonna have to wait.

1563
02:06:51,841 --> 02:06:54,539
Can't wait. They came to my
house. They came to my house.

1564
02:06:54,714 --> 02:06:56,794
- What is the matter - with you?
- Gotta talk to you.

1565
02:06:57,542 --> 02:06:58,892
What's the matter?

1566
02:07:01,068 --> 02:07:02,068
Ernest.

1567
02:07:03,548 --> 02:07:06,334
I'm worried, King. They came to
my house. They came in the house.

1568
02:07:06,508 --> 02:07:07,508
Private investigators.

1569
02:07:10,468 --> 02:07:12,079
- Your house?
- My house, yeah.

1570
02:07:12,253 --> 02:07:14,333
- Who told you that?
- I don't know what they wanted.

1571
02:07:14,472 --> 02:07:17,538
- They just... They...
- They came to my house. - You... What'd you do?

1572
02:07:17,562 --> 02:07:20,130
Look, I'm getting worried, all
right? They knew something.

1573
02:07:25,266 --> 02:07:27,094
- They're gonna know - we did something.
- Settle down.

1574
02:07:27,095 --> 02:07:29,379
King, we gotta talk
about this right now.

1575
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,664
You've got to settle down.
Settle down.

1576
02:07:31,838 --> 02:07:33,278
- Do you understand me?
- I do. I do.

1577
02:07:33,404 --> 02:07:34,797
- Get hold of yourself.
- I am.

1578
02:07:34,971 --> 02:07:36,451
Get hold of yourself
and settle down.

1579
02:07:36,625 --> 02:07:39,454
I'm trying.
I am trying, but you... Settle down.

1580
02:07:39,628 --> 02:07:42,028
When are we... When are we
gonna talk... Right now. Now. Now!

1581
02:07:42,152 --> 02:07:45,025
- We'll talk later.
- Not now. Not now. - All right, all right.

1582
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,812
King, wha... Not now.

1583
02:08:21,496 --> 02:08:24,804
Are you
here because McBride was killed?

1584
02:08:24,978 --> 02:08:26,675
That white man?

1585
02:08:26,849 --> 02:08:28,808
Or is it because we had to go
to Washington

1586
02:08:28,982 --> 02:08:33,334
and pay United States government
$20,000 to get you here?

1587
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:38,731
Well, I don't believe it's too late
to find out who's been doing this.

1588
02:08:39,688 --> 02:08:41,385
- Um...
- Who?

1589
02:08:41,386 --> 02:08:43,083
We have so many deaths,
we've lost count.

1590
02:08:44,693 --> 02:08:46,607
We have hundreds down.

1591
02:08:46,608 --> 02:08:48,523
In the old days,
we would fight these people.

1592
02:08:48,697 --> 02:08:51,482
Twenty years ago, when I fought
overseas in the Boxer Rebellion,

1593
02:08:51,656 --> 02:08:54,181
I could see my enemy,
and I knew who I had to kill.

1594
02:08:55,922 --> 02:08:58,533
If we could find these people,
we would kill them.

1595
02:09:01,797 --> 02:09:05,453
No, no, no, no. It's $25,000
come due on Henry Roan.

1596
02:09:05,627 --> 02:09:08,891
He's been dead months.
He's been dead months.

1597
02:09:09,065 --> 02:09:11,154
Please, just give me
my Henry Roan money.

1598
02:09:11,328 --> 02:09:14,201
You're gonna have to argue that out
with Denver. They're contesting the claim.

1599
02:09:14,202 --> 02:09:16,464
- Who are you?
- I'm J.T. Jones, from the Denver office.

1600
02:09:16,638 --> 02:09:18,421
Well, J.T. Jones,
I want to tell you something.

1601
02:09:18,422 --> 02:09:21,512
This is a Fairfax problem.
It's not a Denver problem.

1602
02:09:21,686 --> 02:09:23,688
The claim went to Denver.
They are contesting it.

1603
02:09:23,863 --> 02:09:26,822
You keep saying Denver.
It's not Denver, it's Fairfax.

1604
02:09:26,996 --> 02:09:29,956
Now, I want my Roan
money, please. Write that note.

1605
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:32,959
Mr. Hale, I'm sorry, but until
I hear from Denver, I can't...

1606
02:09:33,133 --> 02:09:35,222
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

1607
02:09:35,396 --> 02:09:38,225
You're not gonna honor this?
You're not gonna give me that money?

1608
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:40,662
- No, sir.
- Well, you're gonna regret this.

1609
02:09:40,836 --> 02:09:43,404
You're gonna regret this,
Mr. Insurance Man.

1610
02:09:46,973 --> 02:09:49,758
Gentlemen, come in.

1611
02:09:57,548 --> 02:09:59,681
- Hey, Mr. Hale?
- Yeah.

1612
02:09:59,855 --> 02:10:01,378
CJ Robinson's here to see you.

1613
02:10:01,552 --> 02:10:03,163
- Mr. Hale.
- CJ.

1614
02:10:04,904 --> 02:10:06,644
Wanna make a price on this?

1615
02:10:07,558 --> 02:10:10,648
Well, thought
I'd take a look first.

1616
02:10:10,823 --> 02:10:12,346
All right. Make it quick.
Not too long.

1617
02:10:16,524 --> 02:10:18,700
She has no face.

1618
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:21,921
They took her head.

1619
02:10:22,095 --> 02:10:27,404
We didn't smoke her to the sky.
Wah-kon-tah won't know her.

1620
02:10:28,623 --> 02:10:30,712
We smoked the house.

1621
02:10:30,886 --> 02:10:34,542
We smoked the house, darling. You
jus... just don't remember, that's all.

1622
02:10:35,064 --> 02:10:37,023
You don't remember.

1623
02:10:37,197 --> 02:10:41,418
We... We was there with Bill and...
and Reta and Joseph and Bertha.

1624
02:10:41,592 --> 02:10:45,031
We... We was all there together.
We was there together for hours.

1625
02:10:45,205 --> 02:10:47,903
It's just...
You don't remember, that's all.

1626
02:11:00,524 --> 02:11:01,699
Mollie?

1627
02:11:11,709 --> 02:11:13,363
You just rest now.

1628
02:11:19,282 --> 02:11:22,895
James and David Shoun,
Bureau of Investigation.

1629
02:11:23,069 --> 02:11:25,854
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about the death of Anna Brown.

1630
02:11:28,030 --> 02:11:29,945
Get dressed.
We'll be right back.

1631
02:11:33,731 --> 02:11:36,821
I think you need to see the, uh,
justice of the peace.

1632
02:11:36,996 --> 02:11:40,042
He has the inquest records
about Anna Brown's death.

1633
02:11:40,216 --> 02:11:43,306
Those records have gone missing
from his desk.

1634
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:46,831
- So, then you need the undertaker, Turton.
- Turton.

1635
02:11:47,006 --> 02:11:50,879
Yeah, he, uh... He has
all the details you might need.

1636
02:11:51,053 --> 02:11:54,622
- Uh... He kept the skull, - didn't he, David?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

1637
02:11:54,796 --> 02:11:57,712
Seen him too, and that's
what brings us to you.

1638
02:11:58,887 --> 02:12:01,542
Possible you lost the bullet
that killed her?

1639
02:12:01,716 --> 02:12:05,111
Well,
no, because we never found it.

1640
02:12:06,677 --> 02:12:09,724
That's why you were tearing up
the brain, looking for the bullet?

1641
02:12:10,986 --> 02:12:13,162
Yes, that's right.

1642
02:12:13,336 --> 02:12:16,731
The condition of the corpse was so bad
because she had been dead for five or...

1643
02:12:16,905 --> 02:12:19,038
- Six. Six days.
- Six days.

1644
02:12:19,212 --> 02:12:21,736
And, uh, then we exhumed her.

1645
02:12:23,172 --> 02:12:25,348
Why did you cut the body up
into small pieces

1646
02:12:25,522 --> 02:12:28,482
and cleave the flesh from
the limbs with a meat axe?

1647
02:12:28,656 --> 02:12:30,875
We were looking for the bullet.

1648
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:32,138
Uh-huh.

1649
02:12:32,312 --> 02:12:35,141
We couldn't find it.
Yeah.

1650
02:12:35,315 --> 02:12:38,144
You know, this is a matter
for the Indian tribal council.

1651
02:12:38,318 --> 02:12:39,623
You should see Chief...

1652
02:12:39,797 --> 02:12:41,016
- Bonnicastle.
- Bonnicastle.

1653
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:42,975
Oh, what's he gonna tell me?

1654
02:12:43,149 --> 02:12:46,979
This is Indian country.
Go talk to the Indian.

1655
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:49,068
Excuse us, gentlemen.

1656
02:12:49,894 --> 02:12:51,896
Well, well, well.

1657
02:12:52,985 --> 02:12:54,638
What took you so long
to get here?

1658
02:12:56,118 --> 02:12:59,339
Well, I was just assigned
to come down here a week ago.

1659
02:12:59,513 --> 02:13:01,558
Oh. Assigned by who?
The president?

1660
02:13:01,732 --> 02:13:04,561
No, sir. By J. Edgar Hoover.

1661
02:13:04,735 --> 02:13:06,476
Well, I don't know him.

1662
02:13:09,349 --> 02:13:12,787
Well, uh, I hear you're
the king of the Osage Hills,

1663
02:13:12,961 --> 02:13:15,877
and you might be
the man to talk to.

1664
02:13:16,051 --> 02:13:17,574
I can give you
my opinion.

1665
02:13:17,748 --> 02:13:20,273
Most likely this death business

1666
02:13:21,665 --> 02:13:24,929
is at the hands of a band of
men from outside these parts,

1667
02:13:25,104 --> 02:13:26,670
possibly Nigras.

1668
02:13:26,844 --> 02:13:28,150
You saw what happened in Tulsa?

1669
02:13:28,890 --> 02:13:30,022
Yes, sir.

1670
02:13:30,196 --> 02:13:32,546
Then again,
there's just bad luck.

1671
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:34,200
Mmm.

1672
02:13:34,374 --> 02:13:38,508
Anna Brown, nasty mouth.
A friend, but a nasty mouth.

1673
02:13:38,682 --> 02:13:40,249
Bound to happen.

1674
02:13:40,423 --> 02:13:44,340
Henry Roan, he was a
melancholic. You must know that.

1675
02:13:44,514 --> 02:13:46,777
Then, of course,
there was Charlie Whitehorn,

1676
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:49,432
one of the nicest people
you'd ever know.

1677
02:13:49,606 --> 02:13:51,695
What about the other dead Osage?

1678
02:13:51,869 --> 02:13:55,830
- Twenty-five, it's gotta be - almost 30 now.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1679
02:13:56,004 --> 02:13:59,573
It seems more like an epidemic
than bad luck to me.

1680
02:13:59,747 --> 02:14:02,967
Yeah, it seems to me you need to
speak with our justice of the peace.

1681
02:14:03,142 --> 02:14:07,363
I did. Uh, I visited with him,
and he was not very helpful.

1682
02:14:07,537 --> 02:14:08,843
He wasn't?

1683
02:14:09,017 --> 02:14:10,236
Principal Chief?

1684
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:11,846
I visited with him too.

1685
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,589
They said to...
...come see you.

1686
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:19,636
Well, we want to put a finish
to this death business,

1687
02:14:19,810 --> 02:14:21,986
but this isn't the place
to do it.

1688
02:14:22,161 --> 02:14:24,424
I'd be happy to talk to you and answer
any questions, whenever you have them.

1689
02:14:24,425 --> 02:14:27,601
We can meet somewhere else. But
here...? Not quite the place.

1690
02:14:27,775 --> 02:14:29,342
Hmm.

1691
02:14:29,516 --> 02:14:31,822
I guess I-I'll find you
at a later date.

1692
02:14:31,996 --> 02:14:35,261
Thank you for your time, and
I'm sorry to disturb your shave.

1693
02:14:35,435 --> 02:14:39,700
Oh, that's all right. That's all
right. I'll wait to hear from you.

1694
02:14:55,455 --> 02:14:56,804
Hey, Blackie.

1695
02:14:57,718 --> 02:14:58,849
Don't turn.

1696
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:03,637
Government men have been
coming around. Stirring.

1697
02:15:05,421 --> 02:15:07,597
I've done my time.

1698
02:15:07,771 --> 02:15:11,384
No use staying around
someplace when there's trouble.

1699
02:15:11,558 --> 02:15:14,126
I owe you for what you've done
for my nephew.

1700
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:18,260
You stood pat
on that roadster debacle.

1701
02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:24,048
Just spend time down
someplace else. Stay out of town.

1702
02:15:24,832 --> 02:15:26,790
That place might be Drumright.

1703
02:15:29,141 --> 02:15:30,620
- Drumright?
- Drumright.

1704
02:15:31,969 --> 02:15:36,365
Try and get there early.
Nigra janitor opens at sunrise.

1705
02:15:40,326 --> 02:15:42,284
Appreciate the payday.

1706
02:15:44,808 --> 02:15:46,419
Goddamnit!

1707
02:15:51,728 --> 02:15:53,687
- Hands in the air!
- Don't you move!

1708
02:15:53,688 --> 02:15:55,950
Damn it.

1709
02:15:59,562 --> 02:16:03,000
Plié and straight.
Plié and straight.

1710
02:16:03,175 --> 02:16:05,829
Thank you, Bill, for
your support of this town

1711
02:16:06,003 --> 02:16:08,310
and all the things you've done
for this community.

1712
02:16:08,484 --> 02:16:11,487
And now this beautiful
dance school.

1713
02:16:11,661 --> 02:16:15,448
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bill Hale, our sponsor.

1714
02:16:21,802 --> 02:16:23,282
We brought you an offering

1715
02:16:23,456 --> 02:16:26,110
to invite you into our home,
to bless us with medicine.

1716
02:16:28,722 --> 02:16:30,027
You made this?

1717
02:16:30,767 --> 02:16:32,160
Did your girls get a pony?

1718
02:16:32,334 --> 02:16:35,468
- Yes, they did.
- Thank you, Bill. - Course, course.

1719
02:16:35,642 --> 02:16:41,561
Uh, Bob, I'd like you to keep a
watchful eye on your business tonight.

1720
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:46,435
Yeah, I've heard that they're setting
up a robbery of your store at 11:00 p.m.

1721
02:16:48,002 --> 02:16:50,744
So, maybe it's those gems
you stashed.

1722
02:16:52,659 --> 02:16:54,008
Two whites and a Nigra.

1723
02:16:56,184 --> 02:16:57,446
Thank you, brother.

1724
02:16:58,447 --> 02:16:59,492
Course.

1725
02:17:03,931 --> 02:17:08,022
Acie, here's the rest I owe you,
with great appreciation.

1726
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:12,592
You aware there's
federal agents around, right?

1727
02:17:12,766 --> 02:17:16,073
- Uh-huh.
- They're looking into that blast.

1728
02:17:17,553 --> 02:17:19,642
Well, this ain't federal land.
This is Indian land,

1729
02:17:19,816 --> 02:17:21,775
so there's no trouble
that can come.

1730
02:17:27,302 --> 02:17:29,086
Good time to take a trip.

1731
02:17:30,914 --> 02:17:34,701
I have a nice opportunity for you if
you'll let me tell you of something.

1732
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:37,573
Hmm?

1733
02:17:39,662 --> 02:17:41,664
- Sure.
- Okay.

1734
02:18:01,205 --> 02:18:02,294
C'mon!

1735
02:18:07,864 --> 02:18:10,258
Stop,
you thieving bastards!

1736
02:18:33,368 --> 02:18:34,761
How do you do, sir?

1737
02:18:38,721 --> 02:18:40,462
Is this Henry Grammer's setup?

1738
02:18:41,376 --> 02:18:43,639
Any idea where
we could find him?

1739
02:18:43,813 --> 02:18:48,731
An angel done come down and wrapped
her big old wings right in his chest.

1740
02:18:48,905 --> 02:18:50,994
Now he's down with the snakes.

1741
02:19:01,831 --> 02:19:02,831
When this happen?

1742
02:19:02,963 --> 02:19:04,312
Yesterday.

1743
02:19:15,541 --> 02:19:16,803
Put that away, brother.

1744
02:19:16,977 --> 02:19:18,805
- What?
- Come on outside.

1745
02:19:20,676 --> 02:19:23,287
Goddamn it. I quit.

1746
02:19:23,897 --> 02:19:24,985
What is it?

1747
02:19:26,769 --> 02:19:27,770
Hey, Byron.

1748
02:19:35,604 --> 02:19:36,649
What is it?

1749
02:19:37,258 --> 02:19:38,259
Ernest,

1750
02:19:39,173 --> 02:19:40,827
if you're charged,

1751
02:19:41,001 --> 02:19:43,438
if anything happens, you're
gonna beat it. It's okay.

1752
02:19:43,612 --> 02:19:45,092
What are you... You're gonna beat it.

1753
02:19:45,266 --> 02:19:47,529
What are you talking about?

1754
02:19:47,703 --> 02:19:50,097
What are they gonna charge me
with? What could they charge me with?

1755
02:19:50,098 --> 02:19:53,230
Ernest, I have many friends.
Many, many friends.

1756
02:19:53,405 --> 02:19:55,537
That means I have
the best attorneys.

1757
02:19:55,711 --> 02:19:58,453
They protect me,
and they're gonna protect you.

1758
02:19:58,627 --> 02:20:02,065
So you don't have to worry.
Nobody's coming after you, Son. Nobody.

1759
02:20:02,239 --> 02:20:04,764
Thank you, King.

1760
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:06,461
- What?
- It's a... just a...

1761
02:20:06,635 --> 02:20:08,202
What? What is it? What?

1762
02:20:08,376 --> 02:20:10,378
His stomach's all torn up.

1763
02:20:10,552 --> 02:20:13,773
- You all right?
- Yeah... ...Myrtie's a mess.

1764
02:20:13,947 --> 02:20:18,168
- Willie is hysterical. And I didn't...
- I don't know how to...

1765
02:20:18,342 --> 02:20:21,258
I don't know
what to do about it, but...

1766
02:20:21,433 --> 02:20:25,175
But you need...
You need to sign this here now.

1767
02:20:25,349 --> 02:20:28,091
Something happens to you, the
headrights got to stay in the family.

1768
02:20:28,265 --> 02:20:30,006
This is the only way to do it.

1769
02:20:31,965 --> 02:20:34,924
They got to stay in the family.
You know that.

1770
02:20:35,098 --> 02:20:38,450
Well, well... What if something
happens to me... What...

1771
02:20:38,624 --> 02:20:41,322
If something happens to me,
what? What... What would happen to me?

1772
02:20:41,323 --> 02:20:44,368
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
It's just... just a formality.

1773
02:20:44,543 --> 02:20:46,196
Nothing's gonna happen to you

1774
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,851
because I'm gonna make sure
nothing's gonna happen to you.

1775
02:20:51,071 --> 02:20:52,631
You, did you...
Did you sign this paper?

1776
02:20:52,768 --> 02:20:54,988
Oh, yeah, he signed it.
Yeah, he signed.

1777
02:20:55,162 --> 02:20:56,598
My wife's not sick.

1778
02:20:57,512 --> 02:20:59,732
His wife's not sick,
but he signed it.

1779
02:20:59,906 --> 02:21:01,429
We all have to sign this.

1780
02:21:01,603 --> 02:21:04,998
This way, for sure,
the money stays in the family.

1781
02:21:06,347 --> 02:21:07,609
Mmm.

1782
02:21:09,176 --> 02:21:11,047
- Hmm.
- Hey, Son...

1783
02:21:11,221 --> 02:21:12,381
Hey, Byron, give us a minute.

1784
02:21:12,527 --> 02:21:13,702
Sure, King.

1785
02:21:20,317 --> 02:21:21,101
You all right?

1786
02:21:21,275 --> 02:21:23,059
Yeah, I'm... I'm...

1787
02:21:24,017 --> 02:21:26,367
I'm... I'm fine, I guess.

1788
02:21:26,541 --> 02:21:29,849
Mmm. You're not afraid? 'Cause
there's no reason to be afraid.

1789
02:21:30,023 --> 02:21:31,285
No. I'm not...

1790
02:21:33,548 --> 02:21:35,158
You giving her the shots?

1791
02:21:35,942 --> 02:21:37,683
- Shots? Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1792
02:21:37,857 --> 02:21:41,034
Yeah, I'm doing wha... I'm doing
what I'm supposed to be doing.

1793
02:21:41,208 --> 02:21:42,209
Giving her all of it?

1794
02:21:42,383 --> 02:21:44,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1795
02:21:45,255 --> 02:21:47,388
You just gotta remember
to give her all of it.

1796
02:21:47,562 --> 02:21:49,346
I am, King. I am.

1797
02:21:49,521 --> 02:21:52,349
I'm doing like we said. I'm
keeping her... I'm keeping her quiet.

1798
02:21:52,524 --> 02:21:53,786
She's... She's quiet.

1799
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:56,876
Well, just make sure
you do it. Hmm.

1800
02:21:57,050 --> 02:22:01,620
Now, Ernest, I know you love
Mollie, and I know I love her too.

1801
02:22:01,794 --> 02:22:03,622
But the truth is

1802
02:22:04,884 --> 02:22:06,276
she gonna pass on.

1803
02:22:08,714 --> 02:22:10,411
You know that.

1804
02:22:10,585 --> 02:22:13,022
There's nothing we can do
about that. It's in God's hands.

1805
02:22:13,849 --> 02:22:15,547
And he's waiting on her now.

1806
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:23,642
Now, you... You got to stay by her side and
give her this medicine to ease her pain.

1807
02:22:23,816 --> 02:22:25,861
And you're never gonna regret

1808
02:22:26,035 --> 02:22:29,430
spending this time with her
before she returns to the eternal.

1809
02:22:29,604 --> 02:22:31,301
You're never gonna regret that.

1810
02:22:33,303 --> 02:22:34,740
And you're strong now.

1811
02:22:36,089 --> 02:22:37,656
Right? You're strong.

1812
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:38,831
Yeah.

1813
02:22:39,571 --> 02:22:41,224
Be there for her.

1814
02:22:43,618 --> 02:22:45,272
And you need to sign this.

1815
02:22:51,017 --> 02:22:53,715
- You want me - to sign that? Hmm.
- You have to sign it, Son.

1816
02:22:56,065 --> 02:22:57,676
All right, King.

1817
02:23:32,972 --> 02:23:34,103
Evening, boys.

1818
02:23:35,191 --> 02:23:36,323
John.

1819
02:23:38,107 --> 02:23:40,066
This is what I got so far.

1820
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:43,939
I was over in Ralston yesterday.

1821
02:23:44,113 --> 02:23:46,594
I met this old-timer
by the name of Alvin Reynolds.

1822
02:23:47,639 --> 02:23:49,379
Told me a lot.

1823
02:23:50,511 --> 02:23:53,557
I knew
every Indian they murdered.

1824
02:23:53,732 --> 02:23:58,214
That bunch would give poisoned liquor
to dogs just to see what would happen.

1825
02:23:58,824 --> 02:24:00,652
They'd even kill coyotes.

1826
02:24:01,522 --> 02:24:03,742
I don't care so much
about coyotes,

1827
02:24:03,916 --> 02:24:07,267
but it ain't right to kill 'em like that
when they could have a natural death.

1828
02:24:07,441 --> 02:24:10,879
My son-in-law tells me
I ought to keep quiet

1829
02:24:11,053 --> 02:24:13,273
or that bunch will come
after me and kill me too.

1830
02:24:13,447 --> 02:24:17,059
But my time is up already,
so I'm gonna tell you who did it.

1831
02:24:19,148 --> 02:24:21,411
I was sitting right here,

1832
02:24:21,585 --> 02:24:26,416
and I saw Byron Burkhart driving
Anna Brown right down this road.

1833
02:24:30,116 --> 02:24:32,771
<i>Kelsie Morrison and his wife
was in the back seat.</i>

1834
02:24:33,859 --> 02:24:36,862
<i>They took Anna and got her
good and drunk.</i>

1835
02:24:37,036 --> 02:24:41,518
<i>And they were all together.
Kelsie, Byron and Anna.</i>

1836
02:24:42,345 --> 02:24:43,607
<i>I ain't lying.</i>

1837
02:24:44,304 --> 02:24:45,305
Kelsie Morrison?

1838
02:24:47,307 --> 02:24:53,705
Kelsie Morrison runs dope and whiskey
from Fort Worth to New Orleans to Dallas.

1839
02:24:53,879 --> 02:24:56,708
You remember Bill Stepson,
the rodeo roper?

1840
02:24:56,882 --> 02:25:00,320
Bill Stepson died of corn whiskey.
There was no investigation.

1841
02:25:01,147 --> 02:25:02,931
Bill's wife was Tillie Stepson.

1842
02:25:04,019 --> 02:25:07,153
Kelsie drops his first wife Catherine

1843
02:25:07,327 --> 02:25:10,591
and marries Tillie
two weeks after Bill dies.

1844
02:25:13,289 --> 02:25:16,728
Two months after that,
Tillie dies from poison.

1845
02:25:16,902 --> 02:25:19,165
<i>Kelsie runs off with
Tillie's kids down to Mexico,</i>

1846
02:25:19,339 --> 02:25:21,428
<i>but he comes back 'cause
some smart lawyer tells him</i>

1847
02:25:21,602 --> 02:25:23,735
<i>he's gonna be in much
bigger trouble if he doesn't.</i>

1848
02:25:26,563 --> 02:25:30,306
So my dead wife has two kids,
and they have my name.

1849
02:25:31,090 --> 02:25:34,049
So, if I adopted them proper,

1850
02:25:34,223 --> 02:25:37,400
and if these two kids were to
die, would I inherit their estates?

1851
02:25:37,574 --> 02:25:39,272
They're Osage.

1852
02:25:39,446 --> 02:25:41,970
Well, one of them's half Osage,
but they have headrights.

1853
02:25:43,189 --> 02:25:45,844
Kelsie, you realize
that this indicates to me

1854
02:25:46,018 --> 02:25:49,325
that you're planning on adopting
and killing these children?

1855
02:25:49,499 --> 02:25:52,676
No, not if it's not legal
and I don't get the money.

1856
02:25:52,851 --> 02:25:54,374
Then I'm not gonna do it.

1857
02:26:03,035 --> 02:26:04,732
Kelsie Morrison?

1858
02:26:04,906 --> 02:26:07,039
- Who?
- Kelsie Morrison.

1859
02:26:07,213 --> 02:26:08,257
My name is Lloyd Miller.

1860
02:26:08,431 --> 02:26:09,998
Oh. Oh, come on over here, Lloyd.

1861
02:26:10,172 --> 02:26:11,826
We wanna talk to you about that.

1862
02:26:14,786 --> 02:26:17,005
I always admired
Kelsie's ambition.

1863
02:26:18,746 --> 02:26:20,008
Told him so, and he thanked me.

1864
02:26:20,182 --> 02:26:22,794
Kelsie, I have always admired
your ambition.

1865
02:26:22,968 --> 02:26:23,968
Thank you.

1866
02:26:24,099 --> 02:26:25,492
What can you tell us

1867
02:26:25,666 --> 02:26:27,755
about Byron and Ernest Burkhart
and those murders?

1868
02:26:28,974 --> 02:26:30,410
Byron and Ernest Burkhart?

1869
02:26:32,151 --> 02:26:34,109
I think we can
help each other out here.

1870
02:26:37,721 --> 02:26:39,854
<i>I'm in real good
with the people now.</i>

1871
02:26:40,028 --> 02:26:42,596
<i>The Wahzhazhe,
they tell me things.</i>

1872
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:48,167
<i>I'm a trusted friend of Father
Albert too. He confided in me.</i>

1873
02:26:48,341 --> 02:26:51,083
<i>Told me everything that was
going on with Mollie Burkhart.</i>

1874
02:26:53,172 --> 02:26:54,651
<i>Said she fears for her life.</i>

1875
02:26:57,219 --> 02:26:59,439
<i>He say who
she was most afraid of?</i>

1876
02:27:03,791 --> 02:27:05,010
<i>Come on now, Tom.</i>

1877
02:27:06,881 --> 02:27:09,536
<i>You got a better chance of
convicting a guy for kicking a dog</i>

1878
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:11,103
<i>than killing an Indian.</i>

1879
02:27:25,769 --> 02:27:27,336
That's Bill Hale's ranch.

1880
02:27:40,567 --> 02:27:43,178
I sold him a $30,000
fire policy last month.

1881
02:27:44,788 --> 02:27:47,661
Well, Mr. Insurance Man, looks
like you got some work in the morning.

1882
02:30:23,295 --> 02:30:25,036
You're next.

1883
02:31:32,712 --> 02:31:33,800
Well...

1884
02:31:36,107 --> 02:31:38,109
here we go.

1885
02:31:39,153 --> 02:31:41,634
Here we go, huh? Well...

1886
02:31:42,852 --> 02:31:44,245
I got something to tell you.

1887
02:31:45,028 --> 02:31:46,073
You, uh...

1888
02:31:47,553 --> 02:31:52,166
I got something to tell you.
My wife's... My wife's real sick.

1889
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:56,910
I got... I gotta get home and
see my wife. She's real sick.

1890
02:31:57,084 --> 02:31:59,086
S-Son? Come... Come with me now.

1891
02:32:00,566 --> 02:32:05,875
Gotta go talk to my wife. She's,
uh... She's not doing too well, so...

1892
02:32:06,049 --> 02:32:08,269
We're gonna go home, and, uh...

1893
02:32:08,443 --> 02:32:10,750
We're gonna go home and...
and take care of her, right?

1894
02:32:10,924 --> 02:32:12,534
All right, Son. Boy.

1895
02:32:12,708 --> 02:32:15,929
You got this all wrong.
You got this all wrong.

1896
02:32:16,103 --> 02:32:18,236
Whatever you think you know,
you don't know.

1897
02:32:19,846 --> 02:32:22,196
Son, you go with him,
all right? All right.

1898
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:24,938
My wife, she's real sick!

1899
02:32:26,026 --> 02:32:27,245
Been real sick.

1900
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:37,907
Can I, uh...

1901
02:32:40,127 --> 02:32:41,346
Can I sit down?

1902
02:32:43,522 --> 02:32:44,827
Standing's good.

1903
02:32:52,922 --> 02:32:57,100
Wanna talk to you about the murders
of Reta and Bill Smith, and Anna Brown.

1904
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:20,211
I need to sit down.

1905
02:33:21,473 --> 02:33:24,040
Yes, you do.
But you're standing.

1906
02:33:25,825 --> 02:33:27,305
I'm standing now,

1907
02:33:29,089 --> 02:33:31,004
but I'm gonna have to get
some sleep.

1908
02:33:33,224 --> 02:33:37,271
You can't be holding me here
like this... ...much longer.

1909
02:33:39,186 --> 02:33:42,276
Were you alone when you put
the explosives under the house

1910
02:33:42,450 --> 02:33:44,191
or was Blackie Thompson
with you?

1911
02:33:46,672 --> 02:33:47,803
Who?

1912
02:33:47,977 --> 02:33:49,414
Blackie Thompson.

1913
02:33:49,588 --> 02:33:51,416
No. He was nowhere around me.

1914
02:33:53,026 --> 02:33:55,028
Mm-hmm.

1915
02:33:55,202 --> 02:33:59,511
I don't even know him so much,
just... just from around town. That's all.

1916
02:34:02,949 --> 02:34:04,994
And did you put the explosives
under the house?

1917
02:34:05,168 --> 02:34:07,562
I don't know nothing
about no explosives.

1918
02:34:15,962 --> 02:34:18,617
You didn't rob a bank
in Oilton with him, did you?

1919
02:34:19,139 --> 02:34:20,140
No.

1920
02:34:22,011 --> 02:34:25,754
You did, uh,
help Blackie Thompson

1921
02:34:25,928 --> 02:34:29,671
steal your own Buick in 1921

1922
02:34:29,845 --> 02:34:33,501
for the purposes of collecting
insurance money on it, didn't you?

1923
02:34:33,675 --> 02:34:34,675
Uhm-uhm.

1924
02:34:34,763 --> 02:34:36,504
- You didn't?
- Uhm-uhm.

1925
02:34:36,678 --> 02:34:40,073
I let him use my bucket
for a while, but that's...

1926
02:34:40,247 --> 02:34:43,598
I told him he could
ride around. But, uh...

1927
02:34:43,772 --> 02:34:45,208
What did he want it for?

1928
02:34:45,383 --> 02:34:47,515
I don't know
what he wanted it fer.

1929
02:34:47,689 --> 02:34:53,260
That ain't my business.
Probably to enjoy hisself.

1930
02:34:53,434 --> 02:34:57,525
If a man wanted to borrow my car, I
might ask him what he wanted it for.

1931
02:34:57,699 --> 02:34:59,179
Hmm.

1932
02:34:59,353 --> 02:35:02,704
Someti... Sometimes people
just wanna take a ride.

1933
02:35:02,878 --> 02:35:04,837
I don't ask no questions.

1934
02:35:06,186 --> 02:35:10,930
So you loaned it to him? You
didn't ask him what it was for?

1935
02:35:13,149 --> 02:35:15,326
Yeah.

1936
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:18,241
Just a neighborly guy.

1937
02:35:18,416 --> 02:35:24,900
- You got me.
- I loaned it to him.

1938
02:35:25,074 --> 02:35:27,816
I loaned it to him. I guess
that's against the law, right?

1939
02:35:27,990 --> 02:35:29,557
All right.

1940
02:35:37,913 --> 02:35:39,480
How are you doing, Ernest?

1941
02:35:43,876 --> 02:35:45,051
Blackie.

1942
02:35:51,274 --> 02:35:53,494
Um, uh...

1943
02:35:55,148 --> 02:35:56,889
May I talk to this man?

1944
02:35:58,238 --> 02:36:01,546
May I talk to this man alone
for... for a while?

1945
02:36:08,074 --> 02:36:09,728
They got you turned around?

1946
02:36:11,294 --> 02:36:12,687
Me turned around?

1947
02:36:13,775 --> 02:36:15,777
No, they ain't got me
turned around, Blackie.

1948
02:36:17,649 --> 02:36:21,870
Go on now. What'd
you tell 'em? What'd you tell 'em?

1949
02:36:22,044 --> 02:36:25,874
I told them when I came out of
prison, to make things right with you,

1950
02:36:26,048 --> 02:36:27,223
you gave me $1.50.

1951
02:36:28,573 --> 02:36:30,923
You just told us we all knew
the chances we were taking.

1952
02:36:31,097 --> 02:36:33,099
Yeah, we did. We knew
the chances we were taking.

1953
02:36:33,273 --> 02:36:35,449
But I didn't give you $1.50,
I gave you a twenty.

1954
02:36:35,623 --> 02:36:37,582
No, you didn't. It was $1.50.

1955
02:36:37,756 --> 02:36:40,517
I didn't give you $1.50. I gave
you a t... I meant to give you a tw...

1956
02:36:40,541 --> 02:36:43,762
Nah, I did give you a twenty. No, I
remember now. I gave you a twenty.

1957
02:36:43,936 --> 02:36:45,416
- Bullshit.
- Listen.

1958
02:36:46,242 --> 02:36:48,375
You gotta just...

1959
02:36:48,549 --> 02:36:51,900
You gotta tell me what you told them,
Blackie. All of it. What you tell them?

1960
02:36:52,074 --> 02:36:54,163
- I told them all of it.
- All of it?

1961
02:36:54,337 --> 02:36:57,417
I told all of it. I told them how you and
your uncle are too much goddamn Jew.

1962
02:36:57,558 --> 02:36:59,168
Jew?

1963
02:36:59,342 --> 02:37:01,693
Yeah, I'm sitting here doing
life for that Drumright cop.

1964
02:37:01,867 --> 02:37:03,956
Well, I'm telling you
right now, Ernest.

1965
02:37:04,130 --> 02:37:06,393
You can't handle
any prison, boy.

1966
02:37:06,567 --> 02:37:08,327
You're better off
telling them what you know,

1967
02:37:08,482 --> 02:37:11,485
for your sake, for your family's
sake, and for your pleasure.

1968
02:37:11,659 --> 02:37:14,357
Y-Y-You know something.
Youse is as dumb as a washboard.

1969
02:37:14,532 --> 02:37:16,229
- You know that?
- Oh, am I?

1970
02:37:16,403 --> 02:37:18,884
Yeah, you go on yapping first
chance you get, huh, Blackie?

1971
02:37:19,058 --> 02:37:21,321
We...
We were supposed to be partners.

1972
02:37:21,495 --> 02:37:23,584
It ain't my fault
that you... Partners?

1973
02:37:23,758 --> 02:37:26,065
It ain't my fault you got caught
with the car, you dumbbell.

1974
02:37:26,066 --> 02:37:28,720
Call me a goddamn partner?
You didn't give me shit.

1975
02:37:28,894 --> 02:37:31,244
Oh, let me tell you something.
Hale's got a whole plan.

1976
02:37:31,418 --> 02:37:34,160
And I'm gonna talk to him,
make sure you ain't a part of it

1977
02:37:34,334 --> 02:37:36,075
'cause you're so thick
in the head.

1978
02:37:36,249 --> 02:37:38,556
He always said you was thick
in the head. You know that?

1979
02:37:38,730 --> 02:37:41,863
This is the plan. I'm sitting
here because of his plan.

1980
02:37:57,618 --> 02:37:59,315
Mollie...

1981
02:38:12,337 --> 02:38:15,590
Are you real?

1982
02:38:19,248 --> 02:38:20,728
I could be real.

1983
02:38:39,791 --> 02:38:42,184
All right, all right.
That... That's enough.

1984
02:38:47,102 --> 02:38:49,452
Ernest, you're a good man,
aren't you?

1985
02:38:50,976 --> 02:38:53,979
Yes, sir. I am. I suppose so.

1986
02:38:55,328 --> 02:38:58,679
You suppose so?
Are you or aren't you?

1987
02:38:58,853 --> 02:39:00,986
I am, sir. I am.

1988
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:02,770
You love your wife and children?

1989
02:39:04,119 --> 02:39:05,338
Yes, sir. I do.

1990
02:39:05,512 --> 02:39:07,601
You served your country
in infantry and...

1991
02:39:07,775 --> 02:39:10,648
and I don't think this is how
your life was meant to turn out.

1992
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:19,221
Now, it seems to me
your family back home,

1993
02:39:20,788 --> 02:39:25,445
they're more of a blessing to
you than your uncle, King Bill Hale.

1994
02:39:28,579 --> 02:39:33,453
You and I both know he presents
himself as a very righteous man.

1995
02:39:36,804 --> 02:39:38,458
And that's just not who he is.

1996
02:39:42,593 --> 02:39:44,333
He's done nothing for you, son...

1997
02:39:46,335 --> 02:39:47,510
except...

1998
02:39:48,686 --> 02:39:50,252
make you do bad things

1999
02:39:50,426 --> 02:39:54,039
and take advantage of you
because of your... disposition.

2000
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:02,090
So what do you say
we start over?

2001
02:40:06,791 --> 02:40:07,835
I, uh...

2002
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:13,493
I wanna get home to see my wife,

2003
02:40:15,277 --> 02:40:16,627
so you, uh...

2004
02:40:18,585 --> 02:40:20,326
you tell me what I gotta do.

2005
02:40:24,069 --> 02:40:26,593
You know who killed Henry Roan?

2006
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:40,346
Don't you run now.

2007
02:40:44,393 --> 02:40:45,699
I'm here to take you in.

2008
02:41:01,584 --> 02:41:04,264
<i>I understand you know
something about the Henry Roan murder?</i>

2009
02:41:06,024 --> 02:41:08,591
Why, I don't know nothing
about it.

2010
02:41:10,942 --> 02:41:14,206
Well, I have a man here
who says he's your friend,

2011
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:16,208
who says you do know something
about it.

2012
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:18,689
Who is he?

2013
02:41:40,798 --> 02:41:42,451
So this is on my neck?

2014
02:41:44,497 --> 02:41:45,541
Yes, sir.

2015
02:41:52,853 --> 02:41:54,550
Get your pencils.

2016
02:42:10,283 --> 02:42:12,785
Where's my husband?

2017
02:42:13,787 --> 02:42:15,187
Does she have a doctor?

2018
02:42:15,310 --> 02:42:16,616
No. She won't see one.

2019
02:42:17,399 --> 02:42:18,705
Let's take her.

2020
02:42:22,086 --> 02:42:22,099
Are you real?

2021
02:42:24,145 --> 02:42:25,233
Ready?

2022
02:42:30,717 --> 02:42:32,197
Ma'am.

2023
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:34,216
Where's my husband?

2024
02:42:36,549 --> 02:42:37,768
We're gonna get you some help.

2025
02:42:54,654 --> 02:42:56,743
Mrs. Burkhart. Mrs. Burkhart.

2026
02:42:56,744 --> 02:42:57,944
I need heroin, two milligrams.

2027
02:43:03,706 --> 02:43:04,925
You want protection?

2028
02:43:10,888 --> 02:43:12,759
- Mm-hmm.
- From who?

2029
02:43:14,848 --> 02:43:18,373
From, um... From my uncle.

2030
02:43:23,378 --> 02:43:24,945
- Hey, Harve.
- Bill.

2031
02:43:26,338 --> 02:43:31,212
I understand I'm wanted. Well,
I'm here to turn myself in.

2032
02:43:31,386 --> 02:43:33,040
Wh... What you supposed
to have done?

2033
02:43:33,214 --> 02:43:34,734
Killed somebody,
if you can believe it.

2034
02:43:34,781 --> 02:43:36,739
Oh, now, Bill,
I wouldn't go that far.

2035
02:43:36,914 --> 02:43:37,915
Arrest me, son.

2036
02:43:38,741 --> 02:43:40,439
Uh... We don't need to do that.

2037
02:43:40,613 --> 02:43:42,484
Oh, it's all right.
Come on, son.

2038
02:43:42,658 --> 02:43:45,444
- Mr. Hale, a statement?
- Mr. Hale!

2039
02:43:45,618 --> 02:43:47,141
What do you know
about the murders?

2040
02:43:47,315 --> 02:43:49,448
Just a statement?
Just, "I'm innocent"?

2041
02:43:49,622 --> 02:43:53,104
Innocent as a
newborn baby. Even more.

2042
02:43:53,278 --> 02:43:54,598
Mr. Hale! Mr. Hale!

2043
02:43:54,627 --> 02:43:56,411
When am I gonna
get to talk to my wife?

2044
02:43:56,585 --> 02:43:58,544
You told me if I testified,
I could see my wife.

2045
02:43:58,718 --> 02:44:00,851
Well, she is in the hospital
in Pawhuska right now.

2046
02:44:01,025 --> 02:44:03,679
She's in the hospital?
Is she all right?

2047
02:44:04,245 --> 02:44:05,943
She doesn't seem it.

2048
02:44:06,117 --> 02:44:08,249
You tell her I wanna get a
letter to her. I got a letter...

2049
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:10,360
Where they
taking you, Mr. Burkhart?

2050
02:44:10,361 --> 02:44:12,471
I'm, uh... I'm going the
other way for a while now.

2051
02:44:12,645 --> 02:44:15,082
Where are they taking you, sir?

2052
02:44:16,910 --> 02:44:18,825
Where are you taking me?

2053
02:44:18,999 --> 02:44:21,654
We're not charging you with
anything because you're going to testify.

2054
02:44:21,655 --> 02:44:23,575
I know you wanna get back
to Mollie and the kids,

2055
02:44:23,743 --> 02:44:26,143
but right now it's best we
take you out of state for a while,

2056
02:44:26,311 --> 02:44:28,139
keep Hale and his wolves at bay.

2057
02:44:28,313 --> 02:44:29,357
Understand?

2058
02:44:41,674 --> 02:44:44,305
<i>Just for the record,
where are you currently residing?</i>

2059
02:44:44,329 --> 02:44:45,896
Penitentiary.

2060
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:48,550
- - Serving for how long?
- Got a life sentence.

2061
02:44:48,724 --> 02:44:51,075
- For the Drumright job, right?
- Yes, sir.

2062
02:44:51,249 --> 02:44:54,252
And that was William Hale
that arranged that, right?

2063
02:44:54,426 --> 02:44:58,473
That he did. Yeah, that he did.
Funny, ain't it?

2064
02:44:59,344 --> 02:45:00,345
Take a letter.

2065
02:45:01,476 --> 02:45:05,002
"Judge not" by William K. Hale.

2066
02:45:05,176 --> 02:45:07,830
Who asked you to kill
Bill and Reta Smith?

2067
02:45:08,875 --> 02:45:10,921
William Hale
and Ernest Burkhart.

2068
02:45:11,095 --> 02:45:13,706
Have you had any recent contact
with Mr. Hale?

2069
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:16,361
Yeah, I have.
Matter of fact, I have.

2070
02:45:16,535 --> 02:45:19,146
He got a note to my jail cell.

2071
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:22,367
Asked me to kill his nephew, Ernest.

2072
02:45:22,541 --> 02:45:23,934
Mr. Thompson.

2073
02:45:24,108 --> 02:45:26,501
The vilest criminal
may rightfully demand a chance

2074
02:45:26,675 --> 02:45:29,678
to prove his innocence by
a jury of his land. Judge not.

2075
02:45:29,852 --> 02:45:33,334
<i>Yeah, he got a note to my jail
cell saying he could help me exscape.</i>

2076
02:45:33,508 --> 02:45:37,948
<i>And when I got out, take his nephew
Ernest to old Mexico and kill him.</i>

2077
02:45:38,122 --> 02:45:42,213
I sent a note back saying that I
wouldn't testify if he got me out.

2078
02:45:42,387 --> 02:45:43,779
And how did that work out
for you?

2079
02:45:43,954 --> 02:45:46,043
How did what work out for me?

2080
02:45:46,217 --> 02:45:48,219
Mr. Hale's promise
for a grand escape.

2081
02:45:48,393 --> 02:45:50,917
Shit, I'm sitting here
talking to you, ain't I?

2082
02:45:51,091 --> 02:45:52,701
Damn, it didn't work out
too well.

2083
02:45:52,875 --> 02:45:54,834
Judge not.

2084
02:45:55,966 --> 02:45:57,486
Put that in
the <i>Pawhuska Daily Journal,</i>

2085
02:45:57,576 --> 02:45:59,056
<i>Fairfax Chief,</i>

2086
02:45:59,230 --> 02:46:01,030
<i>The Hominy Journal,</i>
and <i>The Osage County News.</i>

2087
02:46:01,101 --> 02:46:02,102
Yes, Mr. Hale.

2088
02:46:05,192 --> 02:46:06,541
Your mama's walking.

2089
02:46:09,327 --> 02:46:10,850
Doesn't she look wonderful?

2090
02:46:18,597 --> 02:46:19,990
Hold steady, son.

2091
02:46:21,643 --> 02:46:22,905
Narrow is the way.

2092
02:47:03,685 --> 02:47:07,080
I demand to confer privately
with Mr. Burkhart!

2093
02:47:07,254 --> 02:47:08,647
This is unheard of.

2094
02:47:08,821 --> 02:47:11,171
Ernest Burkhart is my client!

2095
02:47:11,345 --> 02:47:12,781
The rules prohibit this.

2096
02:47:12,955 --> 02:47:15,828
I demand the opportunity
to speak with Mr. Burkhart!

2097
02:47:16,002 --> 02:47:19,179
This man cannot represent both
the defendant and the witness.

2098
02:47:19,353 --> 02:47:20,572
It is a conflict.

2099
02:47:20,746 --> 02:47:23,662
He has been missing
for two months!

2100
02:47:23,836 --> 02:47:28,188
And I have not had a chance to
communicate with him before he testifies!

2101
02:47:28,362 --> 02:47:30,582
This is tantamount
to witness tampering!

2102
02:47:30,756 --> 02:47:34,542
Mr. Burkhart, is this man
really your attorney?

2103
02:47:34,716 --> 02:47:36,327
I don't know.

2104
02:47:36,501 --> 02:47:41,114
I don't have
a contract with him, but, uh...

2105
02:47:41,288 --> 02:47:43,856
I'm willing to sp...
talk to him. Yeah.

2106
02:47:44,030 --> 02:47:47,555
The
rules prohibit this, Your Honor.

2107
02:47:47,729 --> 02:47:49,905
The prosecution will not allow

2108
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:53,126
any conference between
Mr. Hamilton and this witness

2109
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:55,433
before the beginning
of these proceedings!

2110
02:47:55,607 --> 02:47:59,219
The
Wahzhazhe people deserve justice!

2111
02:47:59,393 --> 02:48:01,917
Give him to us!
I'll be his executioner!

2112
02:48:02,092 --> 02:48:05,356
Mr. Burkhart will be remanded
over to the custody of the marshals.

2113
02:48:05,530 --> 02:48:07,358
Marshals, get him out of here.

2114
02:48:07,532 --> 02:48:10,752
Court is adjourned until ten o'clock
tomorrow. Clear the courtroom.

2115
02:48:49,878 --> 02:48:51,228
I'm sorry...

2116
02:48:53,665 --> 02:48:55,014
for all troubles.

2117
02:49:09,577 --> 02:49:12,079
I'll take you home now.

2118
02:49:27,525 --> 02:49:28,613
Brother.

2119
02:49:30,005 --> 02:49:31,268
Brother.

2120
02:49:34,488 --> 02:49:37,056
Freeling and Hamilton wanna
see you at Hale's tonight.

2121
02:49:37,709 --> 02:49:38,927
Talk things over.

2122
02:50:05,911 --> 02:50:07,260
Sheriff.

2123
02:50:07,434 --> 02:50:08,435
Ernest.

2124
02:50:09,088 --> 02:50:10,350
Aunt Myrtie.

2125
02:50:15,529 --> 02:50:19,838
Ernest, uh, you know
Mr. Solowey? Uh, Solowey Oil?

2126
02:50:20,012 --> 02:50:23,494
And, uh, of course,
Mr. Kraceon, Kraceon Oil.

2127
02:50:26,845 --> 02:50:28,281
Here. Come sit.

2128
02:50:33,373 --> 02:50:35,245
If you testify
against your uncle,

2129
02:50:35,419 --> 02:50:40,685
you realize that this can be held
against you for the rest of your life

2130
02:50:40,859 --> 02:50:43,862
and you can be convicted
for the Smith murder,

2131
02:50:44,036 --> 02:50:48,040
spend the rest of your days
in prison? Do you see that?

2132
02:50:48,214 --> 02:50:52,697
No, I suppose I didn't
think that through too much. But, uh...

2133
02:50:52,871 --> 02:50:57,484
They're giving you the rope to
hang yourself. Do you see that?

2134
02:50:57,658 --> 02:51:01,053
He doesn't see that.
He doesn't see that.

2135
02:51:01,227 --> 02:51:03,447
- Ernest!
- Yeah. Yeah.

2136
02:51:03,621 --> 02:51:07,059
If you do this, you will
be murdering your uncle.

2137
02:51:07,233 --> 02:51:10,628
Ernest, you wanna do that,

2138
02:51:10,802 --> 02:51:14,240
have him die in prison?
Do you, Ernest?

2139
02:51:14,414 --> 02:51:18,505
No. Course... Course I don't want
that, Myrtie. You know I don't want that.

2140
02:51:18,679 --> 02:51:22,466
Yes. You have all the power
to save his life.

2141
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:25,947
He is saving you, dumb boy!

2142
02:51:36,567 --> 02:51:38,351
Do you wanna go home right now?

2143
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:40,353
Yes. Yes, I do.

2144
02:51:40,527 --> 02:51:42,527
- Wanna see - your wife and kids?
- Yes, sir, I do.

2145
02:51:44,618 --> 02:51:46,403
These government men,

2146
02:51:47,882 --> 02:51:51,364
they beat you
and they tortured you.

2147
02:51:51,538 --> 02:51:55,063
Well, no. No, they didn't. B-But
they-they did keep me up for days.

2148
02:51:55,237 --> 02:51:58,676
- No!
- They beat you! They beat you!

2149
02:51:58,850 --> 02:52:01,505
- Yes, they beat me.
- They beat me, sir. - Thank you.

2150
02:52:09,251 --> 02:52:10,427
<i>I had a dream.</i>

2151
02:52:11,079 --> 02:52:12,124
Oh, yeah?

2152
02:52:12,907 --> 02:52:14,648
We went to Colorado Springs.

2153
02:52:16,563 --> 02:52:21,525
You told me all your secrets,
and I held them in a box for you.

2154
02:52:23,222 --> 02:52:26,181
Then we went to the river
and dumped them all away.

2155
02:52:29,184 --> 02:52:30,621
We were happy there.

2156
02:52:33,145 --> 02:52:36,540
Did I tell you how beautiful
you look now? Look at you.

2157
02:52:38,106 --> 02:52:39,151
Hmm?

2158
02:52:39,934 --> 02:52:41,066
You're glowing.

2159
02:52:42,981 --> 02:52:45,592
The insulin is working,
ain't it?

2160
02:52:47,028 --> 02:52:50,380
I told you. You gotta get worse
before you get better.

2161
02:52:52,512 --> 02:52:54,645
What's gonna come now?

2162
02:52:54,819 --> 02:52:59,998
All I know, Mollie, is it's...
It's real complicated.

2163
02:53:00,172 --> 02:53:03,175
White men's laws,
they're ju...

2164
02:53:04,219 --> 02:53:05,612
Sometimes you gotta do
one thing,

2165
02:53:05,786 --> 02:53:07,658
even though you mean
to do another thing.

2166
02:53:09,181 --> 02:53:12,924
And I know that's hard for you to
understand as... as Osage, but, uh...

2167
02:53:13,098 --> 02:53:17,972
What I have to do is go now
and tell the real truth,

2168
02:53:18,146 --> 02:53:21,715
the real truth about what these government
men have done to make me lie to them.

2169
02:53:23,238 --> 02:53:25,371
You kn... You know
they beat me, right, Mollie?

2170
02:53:25,545 --> 02:53:27,199
They beat me. They...
They tortured me.

2171
02:53:27,373 --> 02:53:30,855
They kept me up for days
so I would make up these lies

2172
02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:35,337
and say that my uncle did
these awful things. It's...

2173
02:53:36,904 --> 02:53:38,645
I'm in my right way now.

2174
02:53:39,429 --> 02:53:41,605
I'm in my right way, and I'm...

2175
02:53:41,779 --> 02:53:44,607
...not gonna say
those lies. I'm gonna do the right thing,

2176
02:53:44,608 --> 02:53:47,608
and I'm... I'm gonna protect
my uncle 'cause he needs protection.

2177
02:53:51,223 --> 02:53:52,267
What?

2178
02:53:54,400 --> 02:53:55,575
What is it?

2179
02:53:58,578 --> 02:54:00,058
When will you come back?

2180
02:54:05,063 --> 02:54:06,281
Couple days.

2181
02:54:07,544 --> 02:54:09,459
I'm gonna come back
in a couple days.

2182
02:54:10,677 --> 02:54:12,636
Now, listen,

2183
02:54:12,810 --> 02:54:17,031
they're... They're gonna arrest me
and all that just to make a show of it.

2184
02:54:18,293 --> 02:54:20,513
But I'm not in
any kind of trouble at all.

2185
02:54:21,209 --> 02:54:22,341
None at all.

2186
02:54:24,343 --> 02:54:26,606
I haven't done nothing wrong
in this world.

2187
02:54:28,260 --> 02:54:30,305
They can arrest me
all they want.

2188
02:54:35,485 --> 02:54:37,182
Just make sure
you know the road.

2189
02:54:49,673 --> 02:54:51,413
You gonna testify for us?

2190
02:54:51,588 --> 02:54:53,067
No, sir, I will not.

2191
02:54:54,808 --> 02:54:57,158
You've decided not to testify
for the government?

2192
02:54:57,332 --> 02:55:00,771
That's right. What I told
y'all was a pack of lies.

2193
02:55:00,945 --> 02:55:02,120
All right. You turn around.

2194
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:06,298
You're under arrest for the
murder of Reta and Bill Smith.

2195
02:55:18,223 --> 02:55:20,530
So how did you
come to kill Anna Brown?

2196
02:55:21,574 --> 02:55:23,707
I was hired by W.K. Hale.

2197
02:55:23,881 --> 02:55:25,441
And what did he say to you?

2198
02:55:25,447 --> 02:55:27,232
I was to get
a thousand dollars,

2199
02:55:27,406 --> 02:55:29,887
plus the money I owed him,
which was $600.

2200
02:55:30,061 --> 02:55:34,021
- So you say - you killed Anna Brown?
- Yes, sir.

2201
02:55:34,195 --> 02:55:36,023
You took her down
into that canyon there

2202
02:55:36,197 --> 02:55:39,636
into what was commonly known as
the Three Mile Canyon, didn't you?

2203
02:55:39,810 --> 02:55:41,463
- Yes, sir.
- What'd you shoot her with?

2204
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,160
Automatic.

2205
02:55:43,204 --> 02:55:44,815
And where'd you shoot her?

2206
02:55:46,381 --> 02:55:48,819
Shot her down through the top
of her head. Guess it killed her.

2207
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:50,124
Mm-hmm.

2208
02:55:50,298 --> 02:55:52,083
Now, you say
you were pretty drunk.

2209
02:55:52,257 --> 02:55:53,824
Yes, sir.

2210
02:55:53,998 --> 02:55:56,130
But you knew you were
killing her though, didn't you?

2211
02:55:56,304 --> 02:55:58,306
Yes, sir.

2212
02:55:58,480 --> 02:56:01,962
And how did you get her down into
that place where you killed Anna Brown?

2213
02:56:02,136 --> 02:56:05,400
Mmm. Byron and I
carried her down there.

2214
02:56:05,575 --> 02:56:08,403
And did you make her drunk
so you could kill her?

2215
02:56:08,578 --> 02:56:11,189
- Yes, sir.
- Was she laying down while you killed her?

2216
02:56:11,929 --> 02:56:13,060
No, sir.

2217
02:56:13,234 --> 02:56:14,845
Well, what position was she in?

2218
02:56:16,107 --> 02:56:17,151
Sitting up.

2219
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:23,244
Byron raised her up, pulled
her up, kind of held her up.

2220
02:56:23,418 --> 02:56:25,377
So you stood there
and directed him

2221
02:56:25,551 --> 02:56:28,119
how to hold this drunken,
helpless Indian woman

2222
02:56:28,293 --> 02:56:30,034
down there at the bottom
of that canyon

2223
02:56:30,208 --> 02:56:32,863
while you got ready to
shoot a bullet into her brain?

2224
02:56:33,037 --> 02:56:35,300
- Yes, sir.
- Then what happened after that?

2225
02:56:37,737 --> 02:56:39,304
Turned her loose
so she fell back down.

2226
02:56:39,478 --> 02:56:40,914
Did she make an outcry?

2227
02:56:41,567 --> 02:56:42,786
No, sir.

2228
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:46,137
And did you stand there
and watch her die?

2229
02:56:46,311 --> 02:56:49,009
- No, sir.
- Y-You were satisfied with your work?

2230
02:56:49,183 --> 02:56:52,230
- Yes, sir.
- And you just turned and left?

2231
02:56:53,057 --> 02:56:54,841
Yes, sir.

2232
02:56:55,015 --> 02:56:58,540
Have you seen that canyon
where you killed Anna Brown?

2233
02:56:59,629 --> 02:57:01,935
I've seen it a hundred times,
I suppose.

2234
02:57:02,109 --> 02:57:05,549
A hundred times since. You wanted to go back
there and see where you killed Anna Brown?

2235
02:57:05,591 --> 02:57:06,591
No, sir.

2236
02:57:06,679 --> 02:57:08,115
No?

2237
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:10,378
No, sir.

2238
02:57:10,552 --> 02:57:12,250
Well, what did you wanna
go back there for?

2239
02:57:17,429 --> 02:57:20,432
It's okay.

2240
02:57:20,606 --> 02:57:22,086
You can tell the jury.

2241
02:57:25,045 --> 02:57:27,178
Well, it's a good...

2242
02:57:27,352 --> 02:57:29,746
It's a good place to park
and drink, put on parties.

2243
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:32,183
It can't be seen
from the road, so...

2244
02:57:35,447 --> 02:57:38,058
Where'd you go
after you killed Anna Brown?

2245
02:57:39,059 --> 02:57:40,844
Went to sleep at Bill Hale's.

2246
02:57:41,018 --> 02:57:42,802
Mm-hmm. What'd you do then?

2247
02:57:42,976 --> 02:57:44,369
We stayed drunk.

2248
02:57:44,543 --> 02:57:45,979
Where did Byron go?

2249
02:57:47,415 --> 02:57:48,808
Back home to Mollie's.

2250
02:58:01,168 --> 02:58:02,256
Thanks, Mollie.

2251
02:58:03,388 --> 02:58:04,563
You're welcome.

2252
02:58:17,097 --> 02:58:19,012
Mmm.
Watch your step right there.

2253
02:58:19,186 --> 02:58:21,841
Watch my step. If you
brought me out here to kill me,

2254
02:58:22,015 --> 02:58:24,017
- I'll kill you.
- No, come on with that.

2255
02:58:24,191 --> 02:58:26,846
Sit down here. You'll be
more comfortable.

2256
02:58:27,020 --> 02:58:29,153
Okay, stop. Come on. Get up.

2257
02:58:29,327 --> 02:58:32,634
Hold her up there. Sit her up
straight. Sit her up straight now.

2258
02:58:32,809 --> 02:58:34,287
There you go. Get up.

2259
02:58:34,288 --> 02:58:35,942
Set her up straight
now. Yeah. I got her.

2260
02:58:35,943 --> 02:58:37,727
You wanna kill me,
I'll kill you.

2261
02:58:37,901 --> 02:58:39,554
There you are.

2262
02:59:19,377 --> 02:59:20,726
Ernest.

2263
02:59:21,901 --> 02:59:23,120
Wake up, Son.

2264
02:59:24,034 --> 02:59:26,079
Yeah.

2265
02:59:28,255 --> 02:59:29,430
What? What?

2266
02:59:30,605 --> 02:59:31,781
What is it?

2267
02:59:35,610 --> 02:59:37,787
Well, there's no easy way
around it. Uh...

2268
02:59:39,701 --> 02:59:41,138
I'm to tell you

2269
02:59:42,226 --> 02:59:43,967
that your child has died.

2270
02:59:48,972 --> 02:59:50,451
What... What child? What child?

2271
02:59:50,625 --> 02:59:52,540
I don't know the name.

2272
02:59:53,280 --> 02:59:54,804
Who? Is...

2273
02:59:55,892 --> 02:59:58,372
Cowboy? Which one?

2274
02:59:58,546 --> 03:00:02,376
Is there a child
that had some lung trouble?

2275
03:00:02,550 --> 03:00:04,378
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Like the whooping cough?

2276
03:00:04,552 --> 03:00:07,555
No...
No, who told you this?

2277
03:00:07,729 --> 03:00:09,253
Who... Who told you this?

2278
03:00:09,427 --> 03:00:12,256
It was one of our agents
there in Fairfax informed me.

2279
03:00:13,605 --> 03:00:15,302
Mollie went to see to it...

2280
03:00:16,695 --> 03:00:17,870
and take it home.

2281
03:00:21,787 --> 03:00:25,269
There's no... It... It's Anna.
It's Anna, ain't it?

2282
03:00:27,924 --> 03:00:29,447
There's no easy way
around it, Son.

2283
03:00:29,621 --> 03:00:32,145
No! Goddamn!

2284
03:00:32,929 --> 03:00:35,801
They took my baby.

2285
03:00:35,975 --> 03:00:38,369
God bless you, Son. I...

2286
03:00:39,979 --> 03:00:41,241
Sorry for your loss.

2287
03:00:44,070 --> 03:00:45,245
What happened?

2288
03:00:46,333 --> 03:00:47,508
The baby died.

2289
03:00:47,682 --> 03:00:49,554
- Which one?
- Little baby.

2290
03:00:49,728 --> 03:00:50,947
The little one?

2291
03:00:52,078 --> 03:00:53,906
Oh, my son. My son...

2292
03:00:59,477 --> 03:01:00,957
Oh, my God.

2293
03:01:01,131 --> 03:01:02,349
They took...

2294
03:01:02,915 --> 03:01:04,177
No.

2295
03:01:07,833 --> 03:01:08,878
Ernest.

2296
03:01:10,923 --> 03:01:12,316
Oh, oh.

2297
03:01:13,230 --> 03:01:15,797
Little Anna's
with the Lord now, Son.

2298
03:01:19,801 --> 03:01:20,933
Ernest.

2299
03:01:22,108 --> 03:01:25,329
Lord, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.

2300
03:01:25,503 --> 03:01:27,679
Lord, Lord, Lord.

2301
03:01:33,467 --> 03:01:34,773
Oh.

2302
03:03:35,807 --> 03:03:36,938
Hello, King.

2303
03:03:39,419 --> 03:03:40,942
How's everyone?

2304
03:03:42,988 --> 03:03:45,034
They're... They're not good.

2305
03:03:45,208 --> 03:03:47,079
I know, Son. I feel it too.

2306
03:03:49,255 --> 03:03:51,779
You...

2307
03:03:51,953 --> 03:03:56,610
You know I'm gonna have to take
care of the two kids and Mollie now.

2308
03:03:58,090 --> 03:03:59,265
So...

2309
03:04:00,658 --> 03:04:02,181
What are you...
What are you saying?

2310
03:04:03,008 --> 03:04:04,705
You know what that means, right?

2311
03:04:05,837 --> 03:04:08,883
Well... I'm... I'm gonna testify.

2312
03:04:13,453 --> 03:04:16,978
Well, that's a strong choice
to make against adversity.

2313
03:04:17,153 --> 03:04:20,069
Mmm. Well... You sure you wanna do that?

2314
03:04:20,678 --> 03:04:21,940
Yeah.

2315
03:04:23,289 --> 03:04:25,813
Um, I have to, so...

2316
03:04:25,987 --> 03:04:27,598
They gave you a deal?

2317
03:04:28,686 --> 03:04:30,486
- They gave me a deal.
- Yes, they did. - Mmm.

2318
03:04:31,123 --> 03:04:33,169
They won't hold to it.

2319
03:04:33,343 --> 03:04:36,433
Yeah, well, it's the federal
government, and that's what they told me.

2320
03:04:36,607 --> 03:04:39,827
It's the federal
government. That's why I say that.

2321
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:43,353
Uh, all this is not
gonna mean anything

2322
03:04:43,527 --> 03:04:45,137
except the family's
gonna be broke up.

2323
03:04:45,311 --> 03:04:46,573
Is that what you want?

2324
03:04:47,531 --> 03:04:49,098
It's not gonna
make a difference.

2325
03:04:49,272 --> 03:04:51,578
I tell you this from the
deepest part of my heart.

2326
03:04:51,752 --> 03:04:54,668
The deepest thing that I ever
know in my life, my experience,

2327
03:04:54,842 --> 03:04:56,975
is that this will not
make a difference.

2328
03:04:57,149 --> 03:04:58,237
Hmm.

2329
03:04:59,630 --> 03:05:02,285
You know things are different
now, right? You know that?

2330
03:05:02,459 --> 03:05:06,289
The Osage, they ain't gonna stand by
you. No one's gonna stand by you no more.

2331
03:05:06,463 --> 03:05:09,030
- Osage? They love me.
- No, they're not gonna listen.

2332
03:05:09,205 --> 03:05:12,425
No. They... They know. They know
who gave them the streets,

2333
03:05:12,599 --> 03:05:15,863
who gave them the hospitals, who
gave them the schools. They know.

2334
03:05:16,037 --> 03:05:18,475
I've brought them
into the great 20th century.

2335
03:05:18,649 --> 03:05:19,650
Mm-hmm.

2336
03:05:21,478 --> 03:05:23,480
They're not gonna
stand by you, Bill.

2337
03:05:23,654 --> 03:05:25,134
- Oh, yeah. No?
- No.

2338
03:05:25,308 --> 03:05:28,136
They're not gonna stand
by you, Bill. It's over.

2339
03:05:28,137 --> 03:05:30,965
I mean, there might be
a public outcry for a while.

2340
03:05:31,140 --> 03:05:33,446
But then you know what happens?
People forget.

2341
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:35,753
They don't remember.
They don't care.

2342
03:05:35,927 --> 03:05:38,234
They just don't care.

2343
03:05:38,408 --> 03:05:41,106
It's just gonna be another
everyday, common tragedy.

2344
03:05:41,280 --> 03:05:44,544
Yeah, it's... It's not common.

2345
03:05:47,939 --> 03:05:51,290
Don't do something you're
gonna regret for the rest of your life.

2346
03:05:53,205 --> 03:05:56,687
You're gonna regret... I ain't got
nothing but regret, Bill.

2347
03:05:57,949 --> 03:05:59,385
You have a family.

2348
03:06:01,126 --> 03:06:03,955
Children. You lost one already.
Don't make it more of a tragedy...

2349
03:06:04,129 --> 03:06:06,392
It's already...
...a goddamn tragedy.

2350
03:06:08,177 --> 03:06:09,961
I don't want you near my family.

2351
03:06:11,789 --> 03:06:12,964
Not no more.

2352
03:06:15,184 --> 03:06:16,924
- Well, I'm sorry - to hear that.
- Yeah.

2353
03:06:17,098 --> 03:06:20,014
- It's over now.
- Please, don't throw it all away.

2354
03:06:20,189 --> 03:06:22,408
- No, I can't. I can't.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

2355
03:06:22,582 --> 03:06:24,193
- No, I can't.
- I love you, Son.

2356
03:06:25,324 --> 03:06:27,065
I can't, Bill. Can't.

2357
03:06:31,069 --> 03:06:32,766
Don't throw it away, Son.

2358
03:06:36,814 --> 03:06:39,730
Mr. Burkhart,
you're here of your own accord?

2359
03:06:41,253 --> 03:06:42,559
Yes, sir.

2360
03:06:42,733 --> 03:06:44,604
No one
has promised you anything?

2361
03:06:45,649 --> 03:06:47,781
No. No, sir.

2362
03:06:47,955 --> 03:06:52,960
Did you seek out John Ramsey at
your uncle's behest to kill Henry Roan?

2363
03:06:57,138 --> 03:06:58,270
Yes, sir.

2364
03:06:58,444 --> 03:07:00,881
Did you drive
from Fairfax to Ripley

2365
03:07:01,055 --> 03:07:05,408
to tell John Ramsey
to tell Asa Kirby to do a job?

2366
03:07:09,542 --> 03:07:11,849
- Yes, sir.
- And who asked you to do all this?

2367
03:07:13,154 --> 03:07:16,114
My uncle, William Hale.

2368
03:07:16,288 --> 03:07:17,376
Can you see him?

2369
03:07:18,856 --> 03:07:19,857
Yes, sir.

2370
03:07:20,031 --> 03:07:21,641
Would you point to him, please?

2371
03:07:22,686 --> 03:07:26,167
Yes, sir. He's right there.

2372
03:07:27,908 --> 03:07:32,913
Let the record reflect the witness has
identified the defendant, William Hale.

2373
03:07:39,268 --> 03:07:43,663
And what was the job that your
uncle wanted Asa Kirby to do?

2374
03:07:45,970 --> 03:07:50,322
Uh, to... To blow up, uh,
Reta and Bill Smith.

2375
03:07:51,149 --> 03:07:52,933
Why would he want them blown up?

2376
03:07:55,240 --> 03:07:56,676
So to get their money.

2377
03:07:58,374 --> 03:07:59,723
Are you a married man?

2378
03:08:01,681 --> 03:08:03,683
- Yes, sir.
- What's your wife's name?

2379
03:08:06,860 --> 03:08:08,166
Mollie Burkhart.

2380
03:08:08,775 --> 03:08:10,342
She's Reta's sister?

2381
03:08:11,169 --> 03:08:12,692
Yes, sir.

2382
03:08:12,866 --> 03:08:15,042
She's also the sister
of Anna Brown, who was murdered?

2383
03:08:19,264 --> 03:08:20,309
Yes.

2384
03:08:21,353 --> 03:08:23,703
And her mother is Lizzie Q.,
who is dead?

2385
03:08:26,619 --> 03:08:29,579
- Yes.
- And her sister Minnie is also dead?

2386
03:08:33,104 --> 03:08:34,584
Yes.

2387
03:08:34,758 --> 03:08:39,458
And all these dead women
are Indian women, are they?

2388
03:08:42,505 --> 03:08:43,593
Yes, sir.

2389
03:08:46,596 --> 03:08:49,816
If Mollie, your wife, died,

2390
03:08:51,252 --> 03:08:52,950
who would get her oil money?

2391
03:08:55,126 --> 03:08:58,390
Me and, uh,
our... our children.

2392
03:09:01,219 --> 03:09:04,701
Did your uncle present you
with a plan

2393
03:09:04,875 --> 03:09:09,183
by which you would benefit from
the deaths of all these Indian women?

2394
03:09:14,406 --> 03:09:15,842
Yes, sir.

2395
03:09:16,016 --> 03:09:19,629
And you helped your uncle
on your own making?

2396
03:09:22,327 --> 03:09:23,372
Yes.

2397
03:09:26,157 --> 03:09:29,987
And was part of this plan that you
would meet and marry Mollie Kyle

2398
03:09:30,161 --> 03:09:34,470
and kill her family and her
for their Indian oil money?

2399
03:09:37,951 --> 03:09:39,213
No, sir.

2400
03:09:42,303 --> 03:09:47,918
I met and married my wife
because I... I picked her up in my cab.

2401
03:09:49,223 --> 03:09:51,791
You didn't marry her because
your uncle directed you to?

2402
03:09:53,793 --> 03:09:54,794
No, sir.

2403
03:09:58,798 --> 03:10:00,713
I loved my wife from...

2404
03:10:02,367 --> 03:10:06,806
because that's what happened to us
when... when I picked her up in my cab.

2405
03:10:55,681 --> 03:10:57,596
H-How's my Cowboy?

2406
03:11:00,512 --> 03:11:01,513
Well.

2407
03:11:08,215 --> 03:11:09,869
He miss his pops?

2408
03:11:11,349 --> 03:11:12,393
Yes.

2409
03:11:14,134 --> 03:11:15,571
Elizabeth too.

2410
03:11:21,968 --> 03:11:26,059
They, uh... They know
what's happened?

2411
03:11:28,366 --> 03:11:29,802
Not so much.

2412
03:11:42,249 --> 03:11:44,338
Have you told all the truths?

2413
03:11:46,602 --> 03:11:47,864
Yes, I have.

2414
03:11:50,910 --> 03:11:53,565
My soul is clean now, Mollie.

2415
03:11:55,088 --> 03:11:59,397
It's, uh... It's a relief to me
to be out from under all this.

2416
03:12:03,009 --> 03:12:05,229
I wasn't gonna let him
get anywhere near you...

2417
03:12:05,403 --> 03:12:06,926
near you and the children.

2418
03:12:15,587 --> 03:12:17,241
What did you give me?

2419
03:12:22,028 --> 03:12:23,160
What?

2420
03:12:26,076 --> 03:12:27,686
What was in the shots?

2421
03:12:36,565 --> 03:12:38,784
My medicine you gave me.

2422
03:12:42,701 --> 03:12:45,095
What was in it, <i>Sho-mee-kah-see?</i>

2423
03:13:01,459 --> 03:13:02,634
Insulin.

2424
03:13:33,491 --> 03:13:35,232
<i>Right had won.</i>

2425
03:13:45,416 --> 03:13:47,636
True Crime Stories
has been brought to you

2426
03:13:47,810 --> 03:13:51,988
through the courtesy of J. Edgar Hoover
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2427
03:13:52,815 --> 03:13:54,251
This brings to a close

2428
03:13:54,425 --> 03:13:57,210
the authenticated story
of the Osage Indian murders.

2429
03:13:57,384 --> 03:14:01,127
As we take our leave
from Osage County, we conclude.

2430
03:14:01,301 --> 03:14:05,218
The doctors, the Shoun brothers,
were never pursued by the legal system

2431
03:14:05,392 --> 03:14:08,221
for having certainly helped
poison Mollie.

2432
03:14:08,395 --> 03:14:12,922
Ernest's brother, Byron Burkhart, was
tried as an accomplice to Anna's murder.

2433
03:14:13,096 --> 03:14:15,402
Kelsie Morrison said
at his trial...

2434
03:14:15,576 --> 03:14:16,969
Byron got her drunk...

2435
03:14:16,970 --> 03:14:18,884
...and I did the rest.

2436
03:14:20,973 --> 03:14:23,193
Byron was released
after a hung jury.

2437
03:14:23,367 --> 03:14:26,675
William Hale, the ringleader
of the deadly plots,

2438
03:14:26,849 --> 03:14:29,939
was found guilty and sent
to Leavenworth for life.

2439
03:14:32,115 --> 03:14:35,727
He would write letters back home
to his Osage friends.

2440
03:14:35,901 --> 03:14:37,947
"Dear friends, how are you all?

2441
03:14:38,121 --> 03:14:41,733
I never had better friends
in my life than the Osages,

2442
03:14:41,907 --> 03:14:44,605
and I was a true friend to them.

2443
03:14:45,911 --> 03:14:48,827
I'd rather live at Gray Horse
than any place on earth.

2444
03:14:49,872 --> 03:14:52,483
I will be back with you
before many moons.

2445
03:14:53,310 --> 03:14:56,052
How is my friend Dah-kah-hee-ke?

2446
03:14:56,226 --> 03:15:01,057
Your true friend, W.K. Hale."

2447
03:15:01,231 --> 03:15:04,277
Hale was released in 1947.

2448
03:15:04,451 --> 03:15:09,108
The parole board cited his record as
a good prisoner for his early release,

2449
03:15:09,282 --> 03:15:11,154
but not everybody was happy.

2450
03:15:11,328 --> 03:15:13,591
This man, he is being released

2451
03:15:13,765 --> 03:15:15,680
because he paid off politicians

2452
03:15:15,854 --> 03:15:18,596
and nobody cares
about the Osage lives.

2453
03:15:18,770 --> 03:15:21,991
Hale was not supposed
to set foot in Oklahoma again,

2454
03:15:22,165 --> 03:15:24,733
but according to relatives,
he often visited them.

2455
03:15:28,301 --> 03:15:30,869
What do you want for lunch,
William?

2456
03:15:31,043 --> 03:15:35,004
If only that damn thickhead
Ernest had kept his fool trap shut,

2457
03:15:35,178 --> 03:15:36,788
we'd be in clover today.

2458
03:15:36,962 --> 03:15:40,792
William Hale died
in an Arizona nursing home.

2459
03:15:41,445 --> 03:15:42,925
He lived to 87 years.

2460
03:15:46,798 --> 03:15:49,845
Ernest Burkhart was sentenced
to life imprisonment

2461
03:15:50,019 --> 03:15:51,977
at the Oklahoma
State Penitentiary.

2462
03:15:53,239 --> 03:15:55,241
Aren't you
the one who tried to kill

2463
03:15:55,242 --> 03:15:57,330
his "Injun" wife
for the oil money?

2464
03:15:57,504 --> 03:16:00,290
Years later, he was granted
a pardon for his crimes

2465
03:16:00,464 --> 03:16:02,945
and, once again,
moved back to Osage County

2466
03:16:03,119 --> 03:16:07,906
where he lived out his days with
Byron in a trailer park north of the city.

2467
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:09,760
Pass me a beer, Brother.

2468
03:16:10,691 --> 03:16:12,651
Got a light for my Lucky Strike?

2469
03:16:17,829 --> 03:16:20,136
After Mollie divorced Ernest,

2470
03:16:20,310 --> 03:16:23,574
she lived with her new husband,
John Cobb, on the reservation.

2471
03:16:25,794 --> 03:16:30,015
She died of diabetes
on June 16th, 1937.

2472
03:16:31,190 --> 03:16:33,802
Her obituary in the local paper
said simply...

2473
03:16:42,288 --> 03:16:46,640
"Mrs. Mollie Cobb,
50 years of age,

2474
03:16:46,815 --> 03:16:49,905
passed away at eleven o'clock
Wednesday night at her home.

2475
03:16:51,776 --> 03:16:53,517
She was a full-blood Osage.

2476
03:16:55,084 --> 03:16:57,826
She was buried in the
old cemetery in Gray Horse

2477
03:16:58,914 --> 03:17:02,526
beside her father, her mother,

2478
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:05,921
her sisters and her daughter."

2479
03:17:10,316 --> 03:17:12,144
There was no mention
of the murders.
