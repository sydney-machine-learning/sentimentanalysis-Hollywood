1
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,030
Watch it!

2
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,115
More harpoons!

3
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,575
Ready the nets, men!

4
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,995
-I say kill her 'afore she comes aboard!
-Where is she? Let me see!

5
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,122
Wait. Wait. Wait.

6
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,709
She's a fast one.

7
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,252
-Hand me another!
-She's getting away!

8
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,838
I think she's smilin' at you.

9
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,300
I missed her.

10
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,011
-Another one.
-Come on, another one!

11
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,265
Hey! Hey! Hey!

12
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,059
Move! Move! Get back!

13
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,560
What are you doing?

14
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,270
-It's a mermaid!
-A mermaid?

15
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,522
Use your eyes!

16
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,651
What were you thinking?

17
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,402
These are dangerous waters.

18
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,446
And this is a dangerous time.

19
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,365
Tonight's the Coral Moon.

20
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,369
They say this is when the Sea King calls
his mermaid daughters together...

21
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,995
to lure men to their deaths.

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,288
-Is that what they say?
-Aye.

23
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,083
Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

24
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,501
It's just an old lore.

25
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,550
Back to work!

26
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,717
-Come on, lads.
-You see there?

27
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,302
See what, Hawkins?

28
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,389
Crosswind gust kicked up the chop,
that's all.

29
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,349
-That's the Sea King's doing.
-Give me a hand, mate.

30
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,810
He'd pull us under himself if he could.

31
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,854
-Sail faster!
-Raising the main!

32
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,855
This line's tight.

33
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,274
Where's Prince Eric?

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,150
Up at the bow, Sir Grimsby.

35
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,116
Eric!

36
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,076
What are you doing out there?

37
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,578
Get back here at once!

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,706
You ought to stop worrying so much
about me, Grimsby.

39
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,875
Call me selfish...

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,877
but I do not want to tell the Queen...

41
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,671
that her son fell overboard on my watch.

42
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,715
And on his birthday, of all days.

43
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,387
Looks like there's a Spanish galleon out
there headed toward the mainland.

44
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,972
We could follow it to port...

45
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,891
see what they've brought to trade.

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,852
Our ship is loaded to the gills as it is.

47
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,355
We've risked our necks out here
for seven weeks already.

48
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,774
We're going home tonight.

49
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,942
Eric.

50
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,903
Pay attention.

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,487
I need you to be more careful.

52
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,657
Careful, Grimsby!

53
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,235
My Daughters of the Seven Seas...

54
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,988
I welcome news from all of your waters.

55
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,450
Tamika, Perla...

56
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,285
it's so good to see you.

57
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,164
Caspia, Indira...

58
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:15,375
it fills my heart to have you all here.

59
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
Mala...

60
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,837
Karina...

61
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,385
Where is Ariel?

62
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,849
Sebastian?

63
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,853
You were supposed to see to it
that Ariel was here.

64
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,356
I tried, Your Majesty...

65
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,816
but that child, she is impossible.

66
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,029
I reminded her about the gathering
just this mornin'.

67
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,198
What more can one crustacean do?

68
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,618
You can go find her.

69
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,078
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes.

70
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,412
Right away.

71
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,375
"Yes, Your Majesty.
Right away, Your Majesty."

72
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,169
How hard can it be to find a mermaid,
after all?

73
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,672
If I'm lucky, I'll only have to search
one ocean.

74
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,218
Where are you, child?

75
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,579
We aren't supposed to be this far
from the palace, Ariel.

76
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,997
Let's go back.

77
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,957
How does that work?

78
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,293
Come on, Ariel. Please?

79
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,087
Flounder, stop being such a guppy!

80
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,964
I'm not a guppy.

81
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,349
I think we've gone far enough.

82
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,145
Wait.

83
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,980
What is that?

84
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,648
I've never seen that one.

85
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,860
Come on.

86
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,737
Ariel! Wait for me!

87
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,742
You know I can't swim that fast.

88
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,928
Look at all that.

89
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,806
They must have used the ship
for battles or something.

90
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,850
Yeah, great.

91
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,477
Now let's get out of here.

92
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,645
-Getting cold fins?
-Who, me?

93
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,898
-No way.
-Good.

94
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,235
Then you can stay out here
and watch for sharks.

95
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,736
All right, good.

96
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,530
What?

97
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,406
Ariel, wait!

98
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,756
Do you really think there might be sharks
around here?

99
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,842
Flounder.

100
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,638
Look at this.

101
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,392
It's the smallest trident I've ever seen.

102
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,064
I'm King Flounder, Lord of the Seven Seas!

103
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,609
I wonder why a human
would need one that size.

104
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,944
I bet Scuttle will know.

105
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,863
She always does.

106
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,908
Will you relax?

107
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,743
It's just your reflection.

108
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,912
Calm down.

109
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,498
Nothing is going to happen.

110
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,250
Flounder, look out!

111
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,328
Flounder!

112
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,458
You okay, Flounder?

113
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,459
Sure.

114
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,837
I mean, I've seen bigger sharks.

115
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,047
Just, you know, you can't back down.

116
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,465
You gotta show 'em who's in...

117
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,929
Come back, Flounder. It's just Scuttle.

118
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,481
Ariel. Hey, kid, how ya doin'?

119
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,525
Don't mind me, I was just grabbin' a snack.

120
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,277
Scuttle, we found more treasure.

121
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah. We went into this sunken ship...

122
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,905
and it was really creepy.

123
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,156
Human stuff.

124
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,117
All right, all right, let me see.

125
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,326
Let me see.

126
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,661
Any idea what this is?

127
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,998
Wow.

128
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,124
This...

129
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,625
This is... Yeah.

130
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,335
This is very, very unusual.

131
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,461
What? What is it?

132
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,838
It's a...

133
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,131
It's a dinglehopper.

134
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,341
-A dinglehopper.
-Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,220
Humans use these babies to style their hair.

136
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,847
You just give it a little twirl...

137
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,266
a little yank, you might get some pieces
with it...

138
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,603
and you're left with an artistically
pleasing conflagration of hair...

139
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,854
that humans go nuts for.

140
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,231
Really? I would love to see that.

141
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,816
-Can't.
-Flounder.

142
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:13,942
You know it's true.

143
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,361
Your father still won't let you go
to the surface, huh?

144
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,696
No, it's forbidden.

145
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,115
He thinks all humans are barbarians.

146
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,576
Oh, they're not so bad.

147
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,286
Unless you're a coconut.

148
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,454
They hate coconuts.

149
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,289
I swear, they get a hold of one...

150
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,083
they smash it to pieces, just like that.
It's weird.

151
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,668
-And what's this?
-Ariel!

152
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,795
Swam half across a whole ocean lookin'
for this child.

153
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:34,796
Ariel!

154
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,757
Sebastian!

155
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,051
-Sorry about that!
-Ariel!

156
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,469
What are you doin' up there?

157
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,556
Wasting your time with this know-nothing bird
that can't tell swimmin' from flyin'?

158
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,641
Hey!

159
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,728
I suppose you've completely forgotten
tonight's the Coral Moon?

160
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:50,812
Oh, no!

161
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,189
Oh, yes!

162
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,441
The gatherin' of King Triton's daughters...

163
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,526
minus one.

164
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,486
My father's gonna kill me!

165
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,196
-Sorry, Scuttle, gotta go!
-Yeah, yeah.

166
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,822
All right, sweetie. Me too.

167
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:01,907
Gotta get some air.

168
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,468
<i>Yes, hurry home, Princess.</i>

169
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,014
<i>We wouldn't want to be late
for Daddy's gathering, now, would we?</i>

170
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,351
Perhaps I'll join them.

171
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,646
Oh, wait, what a shame.

172
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:38,068
It seems that Big Brother forgot
to invite Auntie Ursula to the party.

173
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,611
Again.

174
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,576
I should be the one throwing the parties,
not waiting on an invitation.

175
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,789
Oh, the feasts we had
when I lived in the palace!

176
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:58,755
And now look at me, the family pariah.

177
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,467
Wasting away to practically nothing.

178
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,305
Banished and exiled,
driven halfway to madness...

179
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:11,977
in this dim little crevice for 15 long years.

180
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:18,734
While Daddy and his spoiled little mer-brats
celebrate the Coral Moon.

181
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,198
Well, I'll give them something to celebrate.

182
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,161
I may have finally found Daddy's weakness.

183
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:30,996
Yes.

184
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:36,627
Red's fascination with humans
might be just the opening...

185
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,213
I've been waiting for.

186
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,383
It is irresponsible.

187
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,512
Your sisters are only here for one phase
of the Coral Moon.

188
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,639
Can you imagine any one of them missing
the gathering?

189
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,766
No. You're right.

190
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,767
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,185
It wasn't Ariel's fault.

192
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,104
We were exploring,
and a shark chased us and...

193
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,439
Shark?

194
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,233
So, you went to the shipwrecks again?

195
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,569
Those waters are dangerous.

196
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,987
You don't have to worry about me.

197
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,447
Well, I do worry, my little one.

198
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,448
I do worry.

199
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,408
This obsession with humans has to stop.

200
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,285
I just want to know more about them.

201
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:11,912
You know all you need to know.

202
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,288
I barely know anything.

203
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,082
You won't even let us go to the surface.

204
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,209
Why do you have to be so strong-minded?

205
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,086
-Just like your mother. It...
-I am her daughter.

206
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,089
Yes, foolish enough to be taken
with the human world.

207
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,675
-If you would just try to understand...
-Well, I have tried.

208
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,760
I have tried to understand you long enough.

209
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,222
But as long as you live in my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

210
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,266
Do you understand that?

211
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,907
Children, you give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

212
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,534
Was I too hard on her?

213
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,785
Definitely not.

214
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,495
It's like I always say...

215
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,415
"Children got to live
by their parent's rules."

216
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,750
You're absolutely right, Sebastian.

217
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,045
My Ariel needs constant supervision.

218
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,338
Constant.

219
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,756
Someone to watch over her.

220
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,884
All the time, day and night.

221
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,719
And you're just the crab to do it.

222
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:09,720
I am just the crab to...

223
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,221
No, wait, that's not...
What?

224
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,267
No, see, I serve you, Your Majesty,
as your honored majordomo.

225
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,603
There is no better way you can serve me...

226
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,189
than to make sure my little one
stays out of trouble.

227
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,690
-But I...
-Yes?

228
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:22,858
Go.

229
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,110
Go.

230
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,613
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,490
How do I get myself into these situations?

232
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,284
I'm an educated crustacean.

233
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,577
I got options.

234
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,870
I don't need this.

235
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,246
I should be advising the King...

236
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,291
not chasing after some headstrong teenager.

237
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,078
Ariel, are you okay?

238
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,871
He doesn't even hear me.

239
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:22,376
I'm just not like him.
I don't see things the way he does.

240
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,212
And I...

241
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,131
I don't see how a world that makes...

242
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,343
such wonderful things could be so bad.

243
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,681
<i>Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?</i>

244
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:39,685
<i>Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?</i>

245
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,479
<i>Wouldn't you think I'm the girl</i>

246
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>The girl who has ev'rything?</i>

247
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,154
<i>Look at this trove, treasures untold</i>

248
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,908
<i>How many wonders can one cavern hold?</i>

249
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,703
<i>Looking around here you'd think</i>

250
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,082
<i>Sure, she's got ev'rything</i>

251
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,919
<i>I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty</i>

252
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,840
<i>I've got "who's its" and "what's its" galore</i>

253
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,967
<i>You want thingamabobs?</i>

254
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,969
<i>I got 20</i>

255
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,346
<i>But who cares?</i>

256
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,183
<i>No big deal</i>

257
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:24,354
<i>I want more</i>

258
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,027
<i>I wanna be where the people are</i>

259
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:35,032
<i>I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancing</i>

260
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,743
<i>Walkin' around on those...</i>

261
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,913
<i>What do you call 'em?
Oh! Feet!</i>

262
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,919
<i>Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far</i>

263
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,589
<i>Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'</i>

264
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,966
<i>Strollin' along down a...</i>

265
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,010
<i>What's that word again?</i>

266
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,304
<i>Street</i>

267
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:01,475
<i>Up where they walk
Up where they run</i>

268
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,729
<i>Up where they stay all day in the sun</i>

269
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,691
<i>Wanderin' free
Wish I could be</i>

270
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:14,029
<i>Part of that world</i>

271
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,656
<i>What would I give</i>

272
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:21,036
<i>If I could live out of these waters?</i>

273
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,121
<i>What would I pay</i>

274
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:29,127
<i>To spend a day warm on the sand?</i>

275
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:33,257
<i>Bet ya on land they understand</i>

276
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:37,678
<i>Bet they don't reprimand their daughters</i>

277
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:41,348
<i>Bright young women sick of swimmin'</i>

278
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:45,727
<i>Ready to stand</i>

279
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:50,524
<i>And ready to know what the people know</i>

280
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,361
<i>Ask 'em my questions and get some answers</i>

281
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,281
<i>What's a fire and why does it...</i>

282
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,991
<i>What's the word?</i>

283
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,326
<i>Burn?</i>

284
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,495
<i>When's it my turn?</i>

285
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,497
<i>Wouldn't I love</i>

286
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:10,252
<i>Love to explore that shore up above</i>

287
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:22,723
<i>Out of the sea</i>

288
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,437
<i>Wish I could be</i>

289
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:38,280
<i>Part of that world</i>

290
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,441
Ariel!

291
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,609
Don't!

292
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,531
Oh, no, no, no!

293
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,241
What does she think she doin'?

294
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:17,796
<i>I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue</i>

295
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,049
<i>And it's hey to the starboard
Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

296
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:24,344
<i>Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you</i>

297
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,014
<i>In mysterious fathoms below</i>

298
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,068
Who's an old man?

299
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,738
<i>I'll sing you a song of the King of the Sea!</i>

300
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,908
<i>And it's hey to the starboard
Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

301
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,703
<i>The ruler of all of the oceans and seas</i>

302
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,373
<i>In mysterious fathoms below
Heave ho!</i>

303
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,334
<i>Heave ho!</i>

304
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,502
<i>Heave ho!</i>

305
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,378
-Enough!
<i>-Heave ho!</i>

306
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,880
Thank you, gentlemen.

307
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,423
Oh, let's have a dance, aye.

308
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,926
Oh, come on. It's his birthday.

309
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,636
Oh, come on, Grimsby.

310
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,429
What's wrong with me having a little fun?

311
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,555
Everyone else is.

312
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,682
You, sire, are not everyone else.

313
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,352
It's time you separated yourself
from the rest of the crew.

314
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,395
-But I'm one of them.
-And behave in a manner...

315
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,981
more becoming of a future king.

316
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,859
You mean, be more like my father was?

317
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,402
Cut off from the rest of the world.

318
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,321
Eric, you know what I mean.

319
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,823
When you came to us 21 years ago...

320
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,328
the King and Queen took you in
and treated you as one of their own.

321
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,705
-Now that you've come of age...
-Max.

322
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,249
Max!

323
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,000
What are you doing over there?
Come here, boy!

324
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:38,669
Come on. Come on.

325
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,339
-Go on.
-And now that you have come of age...

326
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,384
your responsibilities are at home.

327
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:46,969
Your father would have expected that.

328
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,389
Yes, trapped inside that castle
in isolation and fear.

329
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,182
I can't do it.

330
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,435
-I believe a little fear may be advisable, sire.
-Grimsby, you're not listening.

331
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,855
I want to be a different kind of leader.

332
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,774
That's the whole reason we're on this voyage,
don't you see?

333
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,026
We have to stay open to what's out here.

334
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,654
That's the only way our island can grow.

335
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,990
Eric, think what you risk.

336
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,700
I can't explain it, Grims.

337
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,577
It's in my blood.

338
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,828
Even now...

339
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,415
I feel there's something out here
calling to me.

340
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,837
Storm coming in fast.

341
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,176
-Squall coming in!
-Squall!

342
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,468
All hands on deck!

343
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,970
All hands on deck!

344
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,014
-Batten down the hatches and crates!
-Yes, sir!

345
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:34,892
Tie 'em down!

346
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,104
Get the ropes in! Tie her down!

347
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,106
Man the pumps! Man the pumps!

348
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:43,650
Pull the main sail!

349
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,616
Clew up and stow the main course!

350
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:51,867
We're over-canvassed!

351
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,161
Brail up the foresail!

352
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,633
Stow all of the sails!

353
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:10,802
Clew that!

354
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,433
Drop it down. Open up!

355
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,585
Oi, lads!

356
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,170
Fire!

357
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,052
Grab the port side!

358
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,398
Lifeboats! Abandon ship!

359
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,524
Abandon ship!

360
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,067
Abandon ship!

361
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,485
Into the water, boy!

362
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,778
-Go! Now!
-Jump!

363
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,072
Get in. Get in!

364
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,240
Jump!

365
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:29,923
Give me your hand, boy.

366
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,633
Come on, get up. Hold on!

367
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,552
Boy! In here. All right?

368
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:36,847
Max.

369
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,910
That's it. That's it, boy.
Come on, boy. That's it.

370
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,455
All right, boy. Go on.

371
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:02,456
Go on.

372
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,628
Come here, boy!

373
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,963
-Max! Come on!
-Good boy!

374
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,554
Come on.

375
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,223
Come on, Max.

376
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,224
There you go.

377
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,559
-I got ya.
-Eric!

378
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,759
Oh, no.

379
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,428
Get off me, you fool!

380
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,223
Oh, hey. Didn't expect to find you here.

381
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,850
And I really didn't expect to find her here.

382
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,852
Hey. You listen to me, bird.

383
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:31,313
The King can never hear of this.

384
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,274
We are going to forget this ever happened.

385
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,193
Are you listenin' to me?

386
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,402
Yes.

387
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,696
You won't tell him, I won't tell him...

388
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,990
and I will stay in one piece.
You got it?

389
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,283
Got it.

390
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,284
Sorry, what'd you say again?

391
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,744
I'm a dead crab.

392
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,884
<i>What would I give to live where you are?</i>

393
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:07,933
<i>What would I pay to stay here beside you?</i>

394
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:15,065
<i>What would I do to see you smiling at me?</i>

395
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:20,821
<i>Where would we walk?</i>

396
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,615
<i>Where would we run</i>

397
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:29,413
<i>If we could stay all day in the sun?</i>

398
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,207
<i>Just you and me</i>

399
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,918
<i>And I could be</i>

400
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:38,463
<i>Part of your world?</i>

401
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,470
Check the cove, men.

402
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,306
Checking the cove!

403
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:49,474
Eyes peeled!

404
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,475
On the other side!

405
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,477
Move it, lads. Follow me.

406
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,356
Down on the sand!

407
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,483
Over here!

408
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,195
This way.

409
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,492
Is he breathing?

410
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,494
He's alive.

411
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,038
Alert the Queen!

412
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,956
-You lead, mate.
-Go quickly, lads.

413
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,833
Back to the castle.

414
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:18,712
Go ahead.

415
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,089
Go, let's go!

416
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,342
Let's go.

417
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,554
<i>I don't know when</i>

418
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,182
<i>I don't know how</i>

419
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:37,356
<i>But I know something's starting right now</i>

420
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:42,569
<i>Watch and you'll see</i>

421
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:47,407
<i>Someday I'll be</i>

422
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,745
<i>Part of your world</i>

423
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,343
No.

424
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,346
No, it's too easy.

425
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:13,267
She's already in love with the human world...

426
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,978
and now she found her soulmate.

427
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,107
Wait until Daddy finds out.

428
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,651
He's gonna hit the surface.

429
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:27,656
That little girl's gonna run straight
into my tentacles.

430
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:32,119
Then I'll use her as a prawn
in my little game...

431
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:36,248
and finally get to rip the power
away from Triton...

432
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:39,293
that should've been mine all along.

433
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,340
All right.

434
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,842
Okay.

435
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:51,221
As long as the King never finds out,
everything will be all right.

436
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:56,226
He never has to know she used that precious
siren song of hers to save a human.

437
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,355
I just have to find Ariel
and get her back home.

438
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,565
Now...

439
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,901
she was around here somewhere.

440
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,320
Yeah, this must be it.

441
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,864
I just have to be firm with her...

442
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:11,283
get her to see that this is all just
a passing fad...

443
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,911
and in time, she'll forget all about him.

444
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,538
Ariel!

445
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,207
Sebastian, how did you find me?

446
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,958
What is all of this?

447
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,627
What are you doin' with that...

448
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,212
that thing?

449
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,422
Isn't it beautiful?

450
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,008
Look at the longing in his eyes.

451
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,343
What you know about longin'?

452
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,969
What is he doin' here?

453
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,596
It's from the shipwreck.

454
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:33,972
I found him at Merman's Reef.

455
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,390
And I'll bet there's so much more.

456
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,142
No, no! Ariel!

457
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,644
Child, get back here.

458
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,187
Ariel!

459
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,732
You have to let go of this obsession
with humans.

460
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,067
I'm not obsessed.

461
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,902
I may be crusty, but I'm not blind.

462
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,613
I saw you the night of the shipwreck.

463
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,614
What?

464
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,076
Your father wants you to stay as far away
from them as possible!

465
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:55,077
But why?

466
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:56,411
You know why.

467
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:59,122
We don't have to be afraid of them,
I know that now.

468
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,625
Sebastian, if you had just seen it up there.

469
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,212
The ship rode on the wind,
and they filled the sky with fire.

470
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,297
Okay, okay. Listen to me.

471
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,050
The human world is a mess.

472
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:14,221
Life under the sea is better than anything
they got goin' on up there.

473
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,474
<i>The seaweed is always greener</i>

474
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,601
<i>In somebody else's lake</i>

475
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,646
<i>You dream about going up there</i>

476
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,065
<i>But that is a big mistake</i>

477
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,150
<i>Just look at the world around you</i>

478
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,027
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

479
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,614
<i>Such wonderful things surround you</i>

480
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,658
<i>What more is you lookin' for?</i>

481
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,909
<i>Under the sea</i>

482
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:39,538
<i>Under the sea</i>

483
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,791
<i>Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter</i>

484
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,376
<i>Take it from me</i>

485
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,795
<i>Up on the shore they work all day</i>

486
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,047
<i>Out in the sun they slave away</i>

487
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,885
<i>While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'</i>

488
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,803
<i>Under the sea</i>

489
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,435
<i>Down here all the fish is happy</i>

490
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,812
<i>As off through the waves they roll</i>

491
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,190
<i>The fish on the land ain't happy</i>

492
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,775
<i>They sad 'cause they in they bowl</i>

493
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:11,403
<i>But fish in the bowl is lucky</i>

494
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,697
<i>They in for a worser fate</i>

495
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,241
<i>One day when the boss get hungry</i>

496
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,077
<i>Guess who's gon' be on the plate
Oh, no</i>

497
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,287
<i>Under the sea</i>

498
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,665
<i>Under the sea</i>

499
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,460
<i>Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us</i>

500
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,253
<i>In fricassee</i>

501
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,673
<i>We what the land folks love to cook</i>

502
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,218
<i>Under the sea
We off the hook</i>

503
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,720
<i>We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles</i>

504
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,223
<i>-Under the sea, hey
-Under the sea</i>

505
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,642
<i>-Under the sea, yes child
-Under the sea</i>

506
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,145
<i>Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here, naturally</i>

507
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,522
<i>Naturally</i>

508
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,066
<i>Even the sturgeon an' the ray</i>

509
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,652
<i>They get the urge 'n' start to play</i>

510
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,112
<i>We got the spirit
You got to hear it</i>

511
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,614
<i>Under the sea</i>

512
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,618
Watch this.

513
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,119
<i>The newt play the flute</i>

514
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,497
<i>The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass</i>

515
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:04,790
<i>And they soundin' sharp</i>

516
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:05,916
<i>The bass play the brass</i>

517
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,292
<i>The chub play the tub</i>

518
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,545
<i>The fluke is the duke of soul</i>

519
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,171
<i>Yeah! The ray he can play</i>

520
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,340
<i>The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out</i>

521
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:14,675
<i>The blackfish she sings</i>

522
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,386
<i>The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at</i>

523
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:20,097
<i>And oh, that blowfish blow!</i>

524
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,788
<i>-Yeah! Under the sea
-Under the sea</i>

525
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:29,416
<i>-Under the sea
-Under the sea</i>

526
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,627
<i>When the sardine
Begin the beguine</i>

527
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,546
<i>-It's music to me
-Music is to me</i>

528
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,590
<i>-What do they got? A lot of sand
-A lot of sand</i>

529
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:39,593
<i>We got a hot crustacean band
Yeah!</i>

530
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,012
<i>Each little clam here
Know how to jam here</i>

531
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,264
<i>-Under the sea
-Under the sea</i>

532
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,892
<i>Each little slug here
Cutting a rug here</i>

533
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,228
<i>-Under the sea
-Under the sea</i>

534

<i>Each little snail here
Know how to wail here</i>

535
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:54,483
<i>That's why it's hotter
Under the water</i>

536
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,860
<i>Yeah, we in luck here
Down in the muck here</i>

537
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,530
<i>-Under the sea
-Sea</i>

538
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:03,408
<i>Yes</i>

539
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,496
Hey, Ariel?

540
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:13,001
Somebody got to nail that girl's fins
to the floor.

541
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,438
Don't tell me Eric is still going on
about this girl who rescued him.

542
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:34,815
I'm afraid so.

543
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:36,900
And the shipwreck. Any casualties?

544
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,735
None, Your Majesty.

545
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,320
Well, thank goodness no lives were lost.

546
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,572
Indeed.

547
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,617
This restless nature of his, it concerns me.

548
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,953
Undertaking these dangerous voyages.

549
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,371
Oh, Eric, sit.

550
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,248
Any sign of that girl yet, Grimsby?

551
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,125
Have some breakfast, please.

552
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,501
We looked, sire.

553
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:55,961
There was no girl.

554
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,006
You were lucky to have made it to shore
before you passed out.

555
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,465
She was real. She saved my life.

556
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,592
Sit down, Eric.

557
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,468
-I'm not hungry, Mother.
-I'm worried about you.

558
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,095
You've not been yourself since the shipwreck.

559
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:06,346
Have you checked the neighboring islands?

560
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,723
-Not all of them, but...
-Then I will.

561
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,141
No, you will not.

562
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,853
You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

563
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,438
I'll feel better when I find her.

564
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:18,150
Do not think you're using this girl
as an excuse to run off again...

565
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,069
risking your life on some trade ship
for the sheer adventure.

566
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,487
"Sheer adventure"?

567
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,908
I'm trying to reach out to other cultures,
so we don't get left behind.

568
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,704
Did you know on this last trip
we traded our cane for 20 cases of quinine?

569
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,331
They use it in Europe to treat malaria.

570
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,541
And where are those 20 cases now?

571
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,293
At the bottom of the sea.

572
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,004
How many shipwrecks have there been
in our waters this year, Prime Minister?

573
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,423
-Six, Your Majesty.
-Did you hear that, Eric?

574
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,134
-Of course, I did.
-Shipwrecks, hurricanes...

575
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,720
the sea gods are against us.

576
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,388
How many times do I have to...

577
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:56,313
They are eroding our land from under us...

578
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,190
stealing it back into the ocean.

579
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,733
They would kill us all if they could.

580
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,901
That's ridiculous.

581
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,402
Is it?

582
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,864
May I remind you, that a deadly shipwreck
first brought you to us.

583
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:09,034
And now, I almost lost you to one
the other day.

584
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,370
We cannot keep tempting fate like this.

585
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:12,621
It has got to stop.

586
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,373
Well, what does that mean?

587
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,166
It means that...

588
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:21,463
that your responsibilities are here now.

589
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,674
So, no more voyages...

590
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,260
and no more chasing after girls
who don't exist.

591
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:50,033
<i>All I ever wanted was the open sea and sky</i>

592
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,787
<i>Freedom from the life I always knew</i>

593
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:58,333
<i>Now, all I am is haunted
As days and hours roll by</i>

594
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,336
<i>All I ever think about is you</i>

595
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:03,922
<i>There you are</i>

596
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,799
<i>Over me</i>

597
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:09,178
<i>Taking me with your song</i>

598
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:13,348
<i>To wild uncharted waters</i>

599
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,560
<i>Miles beyond the sea</i>

600
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,104
<i>I was darkness bound</i>

601
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,148
<i>I had almost drowned</i>

602
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:25,110
<i>Till you came around, and you found me</i>

603
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,198
<i>Now I am on the shoreline</i>

604
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,700
<i>But I'm still lost at sea</i>

605
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,706
<i>In these wild uncharted waters, come find me</i>

606
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,583
<i>Again</i>

607
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,884
<i>All I do is wonder
Who you are and where you'll be</i>

608
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,888
<i>In my mind, your melody goes on</i>

609
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:57,184
<i>Stronger than the undertow
The night you rescued me</i>

610
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:00,229
<i>Silhouetted by the rising dawn</i>

611
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,816
<i>Over you</i>

612
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:08,362
<i>I cannot get over you</i>

613
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:12,491
<i>In wild uncharted waters</i>

614
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:15,744
<i>Beyond where man can see</i>

615
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:19,831
<i>When your eyes outshine the horizon line</i>

616
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:24,044
<i>And you're finally real, here beside me</i>

617
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,923
<i>Now I'm right here on the shoreline</i>

618
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,718
<i>I'm right where you left me</i>

619
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,679
<i>And your voice is like</i>

620
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:36,098
<i>A siren that guides me</i>

621
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:39,810
<i>To wild uncharted waters</i>

622
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:43,355
<i>Alone, just you and me</i>

623
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:47,276
<i>And I hope you're there, in the open air</i>

624
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:52,239
<i>There's no map or compass to guide me, no</i>

625
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:55,325
<i>Time may change the shoreline</i>

626
00:42:55,492 --> 00:43:00,497
<i>But time will not change me</i>

627
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,417
<i>If it takes my life</i>

628
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:07,754
<i>I will finally find you again</i>

629
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,301
<i>In uncharted waters</i>

630
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,802
<i>Come find me</i>

631
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:18,891
<i>Again</i>

632
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,121
Ariel, could you give me a hand?

633
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,210
Ariel!

634
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,921
Yes, of course.

635
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,048
How do we untangle this?

636
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:55,052
Do these humans have any idea
how much damage their shipwrecks do?

637
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,095
I don't think they intended
to have a shipwreck.

638
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:58,972
They are careless, Ariel.

639
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,934
It will take thousands of years
for this coral to grow back.

640
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,269
And they've killed
nearly all of the sea fern.

641
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,438
They'd kill us too, if they had the chance.

642
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,732
No, no. They're not all like that.

643
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:10,734
How would you know?

644
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,569
You've never even seen one.

645
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,404
You were just a child when Mother died...

646
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:17,115
and Father stopped us going to the surface.

647
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,078
I just mean, we're not all the same,
so why should humans be?

648
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,955
What about humans?

649
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,500
-I just meant...
-Look at what their shipwreck did.

650
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,586
They got what they deserved.

651
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:33,632
They are the most dangerous species of all.

652
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:35,384
Spoiling our waters...

653
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:37,719
destroying the reefs...

654
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:41,139
having no respect
for the balance of the oceans.

655
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:46,061
They're not the only ones who have no respect
for balance.

656
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:51,024
Ariel, where are you...

657
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,694
What's going on with her?

658
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,195
Oh, she's just at that age...

659
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,865
when she doesn't want to hang out
with her older sisters anymore.

660
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:00,450
Exactly. You remember what I was like.

661
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,077
How could we forget?

662
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,037
Well, I wonder who the lucky merman is.

663
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,927
The crab, Your Majesty.

664
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,389
Come over here, Sebastian.

665
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,476
Breathe, Sebastian.

666
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:29,146
Remember, guilty is as guilty acts.

667
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:32,149
Don't overreact, remain calm.

668
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:38,655
Yes?

669
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,991
Yes, Your Majesty?

670
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:42,868
Sebastian...

671
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:46,747
have you noticed that Ariel
has been acting peculiar lately?

672
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,166
Peculiar, sir?

673
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,877
Distracted, daydreaming...

674
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,670
disappearing for hours.

675
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,465
You haven't noticed?

676
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,383
Well, I...

677
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,224
I actually haven't, you know...

678
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,934
that is to say, I didn't...

679
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:11,146
Sebastian...

680
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,066
I know you've been keeping something from me.

681
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:15,734
Keepin' somethin'?

682
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:18,987
About Ariel.

683
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:20,656
Ariel?

684
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,416
Is my little one in love?

685
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:35,254
Oh, I tried to stop her, sir!

686
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,922
I tried to stop her
from going to the surface!

687
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,549
I told her to stay away from humans!

688
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:40,133
-Humans?
-When I saw her with that statue I...

689
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,511
Humans? Who said anything about humans?

690
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,392
Let's just drop these things off and go back.

691
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:49,393
No way!

692
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,144
With all that great stuff still down there?

693
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,354
Don't we have enough already?

694
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,982
Come on, Flounder.
We're just getting started.

695
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,191
So...

696
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:00,070
You broke the rules?

697
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,283
You went to the above world.

698
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:08,328
There was a shipwreck.

699
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,124
A man was drowning. I had to save him.

700
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,626
You should have let him drown.

701
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:16,253
They're savages.

702
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,671
You don't know that.

703
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,466
They killed your mother.

704
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:23,385
I know.

705
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:25,679
But...

706
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:27,264
one man did.

707
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:29,474
Why blame every human?

708
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:30,851
-Mother wouldn't.
-No!

709
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,936
Enough. That's enough.

710
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:35,189
And Eric had nothing to do with it.

711
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,648
Eric?

712
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:38,650
Eric?

713
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:40,819
Have you lost your senses completely?

714
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,030
If you would have just heard him, Father.

715
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,824
He's compassionate and kind and...

716
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:47,201
He's a human!

717
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,660
-You're a mermaid!
-Yes.

718
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,329
But that doesn't make us enemies.

719
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,414
Promise me you will never look for him again.

720
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,250
-I can't.
-Promise me, Ariel!

721
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,211
I can't lie to you. I won't.

722
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,296
I swear, I will get through to you!

723
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:01,507
No!

724
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:02,841
Please!

725
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:04,843
Father, stop.

726
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,929
This ends now!

727
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:10,349
Please, stop it!

728
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:12,142
It's for your own good.

729
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:15,812
Father, no!

730
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:46,677
Never leave again.

731
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,367
Ariel.

732
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:12,452
I'm...

733
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,954
Just go away.

734
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:34,099
Poor child.

735
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:36,310
Poor sweet child.

736
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,521
He can be so angry.

737
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:42,524
He thinks he knows everything.

738
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,569
Who are you?

739
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,572
You must not remember me.

740
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:51,074
I'm your Auntie Ursula.

741
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:53,202
The Sea Witch?

742
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:54,453
The what?

743
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,749
What has your father told you about me?

744
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:04,713
That you like to stir up trouble
between humans and merpeople.

745
00:50:05,464 --> 00:50:07,132
Is that what he said?

746
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,011
I'm not half the monster he claims I am.

747
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,305
And I'm only here to help.

748
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,016
I don't need your help.

749
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:18,560
Whatever you say, darling.

750
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:25,651
-Wait.
-Yes?

751
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,948
How can you help me?

752
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,375
Ariel?

753
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,587
Where is she going
with those slippery good-for-nothin's?

754
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:46,880
Let's go.

755
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:12,883
Come in.

756
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,968
Come in, child.

757
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,930
We mustn't lurk in passageways.

758
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,640
It's rude.

759
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:23,310
Forgive my aggressive garden.

760
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:28,315
I wouldn't choose to live like this,
believe me.

761
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:30,943
Daddy's been so unfair to both of us...

762
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:34,613
controlling everything we say and do.

763
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:39,201
In a way, we're the same, you and I.

764
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:43,539
You don't seem at all like
Father described you.

765
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:44,957
Is that right?

766
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,085
We never did get along.

767
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:50,504
Squidling rivalry.

768
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:53,340
He always got what he wanted,
and what did I get? Nothin'.

769
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:56,051
Zip, nada, squat.

770
00:52:57,302 --> 00:52:58,679
Sound familiar, hon?

771
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:02,641
Oh, I know what you're going through,
believe me...

772
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:05,561
and I know why you're here.

773
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,688
I'm not sure I do.

774
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,022
Oh, please.

775
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:13,819
I've been watching you
for a long time now, dearie.

776
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:18,156
What you really want is to be up there
in the above world.

777
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:21,118
It's always had your curiosity...

778
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:24,246
and now it's got your heart.

779
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,747
What do you mean?

780
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,834
You're so young.

781
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,879
Don't you see?

782
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:33,839
You're meant for each other.

783
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:39,052
And I can't bear to see you suffer like this.

784
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:42,181
As it happens, I can help you.

785
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,057
How?

786
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,728
The problem is simple.

787
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,481
You can't live in that world, unless...

788
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:55,402
you become a human yourself.

789
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:57,487
Become human?

790
00:53:58,697 --> 00:53:59,907
Is that even possible?

791
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,075
Oh, my dear.

792
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:05,120
It's what I do.

793
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:08,457
It's what I live for.

794
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:13,170
<i>I admit that in the past I've been a nasty</i>

795
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,840
<i>They weren't kidding when they called me
Well, a witch</i>

796
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,884
<i>But you'll find that nowadays</i>

797
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:20,886
<i>I've mended all my ways</i>

798
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:24,348
<i>Repented, seen the light, and made a switch</i>

799
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:27,309
<i>True? Yes</i>

800
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:31,897
<i>And I fortunately know a little magic</i>

801
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:36,026
<i>It's a talent that I always have possessed</i>

802
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:38,237
<i>And here lately, please don't laugh</i>

803
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:40,239
<i>I use it on behalf</i>

804
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:44,117
<i>Of the miserable, lonely, and depressed</i>

805
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,119
<i>Pathetic</i>

806
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:49,414
<i>Poor unfortunate souls</i>

807
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:53,126
<i>In pain, in need</i>

808
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,795
<i>This one longing to be thinner</i>

809
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,505
<i>That one wants to get the girl</i>

810
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:58,507
<i>And do I help them?</i>

811
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:00,425
<i>Yes, indeed</i>

812
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:03,804
<i>Those poor unfortunate souls</i>

813
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:07,641
<i>So sad, so true</i>

814
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:09,393
<i>They come flocking to my cauldron</i>

815
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,311
<i>Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"</i>

816
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,479
<i>And I help them?</i>

817
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,481
<i>Yes, I do</i>

818
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,443
<i>Now, it's happened once or twice</i>

819
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,863
<i>Someone couldn't pay the price</i>

820
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:25,367
<i>And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em
'cross the coals</i>

821
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:28,954
<i>Yes, I've had the odd complaint</i>

822
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:34,501
<i>But on the whole, I've been a saint</i>

823
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:40,132
<i>To those poor unfortunate souls</i>

824
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:44,261
-The Sea Witch!
-Shh.

825
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,972
So, here's the deal.

826
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:50,517
I'll whip up a little potion
to make you human for three days.

827
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:51,685
Got that?

828
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:52,853
Three days.

829
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:58,317
Before the sun sets on the third day,
you and Princey must share a kiss.

830
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:00,694
And not just any kiss.

831
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,946
The kiss of true love.

832
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:09,036
If you do, you will remain human permanently.

833
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:11,246
But if you don't...

834
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:15,209
you'll turn back into a mermaid...

835
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:18,295
and you belong to me.

836
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:19,922
-No, Ariel!
-Shh.

837
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:22,633
You understand, of course...

838
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,261
that you'll have to give up
your mermaid gifts.

839
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:30,307
You won't have this tail of yours,
hangin' around, draggin' you down.

840
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,936
You won't be able to breathe underwater,
who needs it?

841
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,191
And you'll no longer have
that siren song of yours...

842
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,611
because that wouldn't be fair, now would it?

843
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:44,613
Don't worry.

844
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,742
I'll keep it safe and soundless here with me.

845
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:51,703
We got a deal?

846
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,083
I don't know.

847
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,001
Well...

848
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:00,671
I mean, I just gave you
the premium package, kid.

849
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:01,755
Well...

850
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,511
life's full of tough choices, idn't?

851
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:12,266
No.

852
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:14,059
This is wrong. I can't do this.

853
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,480
Fine then, forget about the world above.

854
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:21,149
Go back home to Daddy...

855
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:23,318
and "Never leave again!"

856
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:27,948
<i>Come on, you poor unfortunate soul!</i>

857
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:29,283
<i>Go ahead</i>

858
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,159
<i>Make your choice</i>

859
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:32,661
<i>I'm a very busy woman</i>

860
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:34,538
<i>And I haven't got all day</i>

861
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:37,541
<i>It won't cost much, just your voice</i>

862
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,545
<i>You poor unfortunate soul</i>

863
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:44,965
<i>It's sad, but true</i>

864
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:46,758
<i>If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet</i>

865
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:48,218
<i>You've got to pay the toll</i>

866
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:49,928
<i>Pluck a scale from off your tail</i>

867
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:51,638
<i>A drop of blood inside the bowl!</i>

868
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,682
<i>Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys</i>

869
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,352
<i>For boss is on a roll!</i>

870
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:01,732
<i>This poor unfortunate</i>

871
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:04,902
<i>Soul!</i>

872
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:16,872
<i>Beluga! Sevruga!
Come winds of the Caspian Sea!</i>

873
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:22,294
<i>Amnesia, glossitis et max laryngitis</i>

874
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,588
<i>La voce to me!</i>

875
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,717
Now sing!

876
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:39,269
Keep singing!

877
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:00,040
Yes!

878
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:01,834
Yes!

879
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:09,800
Look at her stupid little feet!

880
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,281
Oh, Ariel.

881
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,118
Well, come on, gal.

882
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:37,828
It's either sink or swim.

883
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:50,174
Don't worry, boys.

884
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:54,636
She doesn't stand a chance without this.

885
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,264
A mermaid without her voice?

886
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,268
And just in case...

887
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:05,314
I slipped a little somethin' extra
into that spell of mine.

888
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:08,984
No matter how hard that girl tries...

889
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:13,238
she won't remember
she needs to get that kiss.

890
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,657
Now it's just a matter of time.

891
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:18,994
And then she's mine.

892
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:29,254
Not so easy without your tail, is it?

893
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:31,840
Keep going.

894
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,592
You just got to get your sea legs.

895
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:35,719
We're almost there.

896
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:46,355
Get away from here!

897
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:49,566
Lord have mercy.

898
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,237
Are you all right?

899
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:57,908
Ah, poor girl.

900
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,326
You must be in shock.

901
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,454
I'll go find something to cover you up.

902
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,915
Another shipwreck.

903
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:07,251
<i>Santa Maria.</i>

904
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,147
Say, what's goin' on, kid?

905
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:31,859
I thought you weren't supposed to be up here,
now you're taking boat rides?

906
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,820
That rotten Sea Witch,
she stole Ariel's voice.

907
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:36,238
Hey, Flounder.

908
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:37,573
What are you talkin' about?

909
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,867
So, Sebastian told Triton
that Ariel saved a human...

910
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,201
-and Triton got so mad.
-Okay, okay, okay.

911
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:42,953
-And then... Wait!
-Explanations later, man.

912
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,413
-We've gotta get you out of here.
-Wait!

913
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,206
-I didn't tell you about the Sea Witch!
-Bye-bye.

914
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,876
And don't tell anyone about the Sea Witch!

915
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:53,046
Something about you seems different.

916
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:54,339
Don't tell me.

917
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:56,466
It's your hairdo, right?

918
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,051
'Cause you've been using the dinglehopper?
No?

919
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:01,972
I can't quite figure it out...

920
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,017
but I know that if I stand here
for long enough...

921
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:07,519
She got legs, ya idiot!

922
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:09,271
You know, we've discussed this.

923
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:10,939
I don't like it when you call me an idiot.

924
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,316
Why don't you tell me somethin' nice?

925
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:14,318
-"Hey, Scuttle. Your feathers look good."
-Shoo!

926
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:16,737
Here you are.

927
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,906
It'll have to do for now.

928
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:20,741
I'll take you to the castle.

929
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:22,451
They'll know what to do with you there.

930
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:24,912
Come on, in ya go.

931
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,295
Good catch today.

932
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:34,379
It looks good, though.

933
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:35,547
It looks raw.

934
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:38,842
You're not done yet?

935
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,761
His looks so good!

936
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,346
I must say a parrie fish.

937
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:44,264
Got plenty of fish for two weeks.

938
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:47,476
Hey!

939
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:52,856
<i>Look at the sun and the sky
And the sand and the sea behind me</i>

940
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:56,318
<i>Look at me, suddenly I am on land
And I'm free</i>

941
01:02:56,485 --> 01:03:00,364
<i>Don't mind me as I climb for the first time</i>

942
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:03,659
<i>Jump for the first time</i>

943
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:06,662
<i>Trying to stand
But this gravity's pulling me down</i>

944
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:13,627
Walk on, Emile.

945
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,879
Trot on!

946
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:19,925
Trot on!

947
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:21,218
Get Lashana, quick!

948
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:22,511
Right-o!

949
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:26,890
What is all this?

950
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:28,433
What on Earth?

951
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,394
The girl got tangled in the net.

952
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:33,689
-She all right?
-She'll survive.

953
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:35,107
But she's been through it, though.

954
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:36,316
Won't say a word.

955
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:38,318
I wonder what happened to her out there.

956
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,696
<i>Look, it's a fire, it's warm and it glows</i>

957
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:43,615
<i>And it lights this chamber</i>

958
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:45,409
<i>Let me admire it
Ow!</i>

959
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:47,077
<i>Get too close and it bites</i>

960
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:51,707
<i>I came too close for the first time</i>

961
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,376
<i>Burned for the first time</i>

962
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:57,045
<i>Everything's clearer and brighter and hotter</i>

963
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:59,631
<i>But now that I'm here
Like a fish out of water</i>

964
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:03,218
<i>I'm trying to stand
But this gravity's pulling me down</i>

965
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:05,596
Oh, my! Heavens.

966
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:07,764
Here, let me take you upstairs...

967
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,517
get you cleaned up,
find you some clothes.

968
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:14,188
Okay, up we go...

969
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,858
one step at a time.

970
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,820
She can't speak at all?

971
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,822
Can you blame her, Rosa?

972
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:25,782
After all she's been through...

973
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:27,993
it's a blessing she's not worse off.

974
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,037
Such a faraway look in her eye.

975
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,165
Bit of a soap and a scrub,
she'll be good as new.

976
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:37,044
<i>Are we only</i>

977
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:40,047
<i>Food for slaughter?</i>

978
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:43,050
<i>Is this life on land?</i>

979
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,093
Child, the blue dress that's in your room.

980
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:50,390
<i>Well, you were lonely under water</i>

981
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:53,435
<i>Come on, Ariel, time to stand</i>

982
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:58,232
There you go. Smells nice, doesn't it?

983
01:04:58,398 --> 01:04:59,566
Oh, no, you poor girl.

984
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,235
You must be starvin'.

985
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,070
Rosa, get this poor child some food.

986
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:05,572
And quick, before she tries to
eat the scrub brush.

987
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:07,449
-Yes, ma'am.
-Right.

988
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:10,702
Let's get that seaweed stink off you, girl.

989
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:12,037
Yes.

990
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,465
<i>Squeeze in the shoes
And the corset, it's tight</i>

991
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:26,718
<i>And the seams are busting</i>

992
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:28,804
<i>Some women choose this
I guess it's all right</i>

993
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:31,139
<i>Are my dreams adjusting</i>

994
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:32,307
Hard to believe...

995
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:34,768
two shipwrecks in one week.

996
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:37,729
Prince Eric's still looking for
that girl who saved him.

997
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,606
Said he won't rest until he finds her.

998
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:44,820
Stay right there. I'll get the Prince.

999
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:49,199
<i>As I wait for the first time</i>

1000
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,743
<i>Here for the first time</i>

1001
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,538
<i>Now, for the first time</i>

1002
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:59,835
<i>He's coming through those doors</i>

1003
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,797
<i>Up the stairs</i>

1004
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:11,388
<i>From the shore</i>

1005
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:17,811
<i>From that moment</i>

1006
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,355
<i>And he'll smile</i>

1007
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:23,609
<i>Like he knows</i>

1008
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:25,569
<i>When I say</i>

1009
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:32,159
I'm so sorry to hear what happened.

1010
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:33,911
What's your name?

1011
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,746
She doesn't speak, sire.

1012
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,208
She...

1013
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,590
Well, we're glad you've made it to us.

1014
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:49,718
Do you have a place to stay?

1015
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:50,886
Family?

1016
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,723
Well, then you're welcome to stay here.

1017
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,600
For as long as you like.

1018
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,478
Make sure she has anything she needs.

1019
01:06:59,645 --> 01:07:00,729
Yes, Your Highness.

1020
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:14,076
We should let you get some rest.

1021
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:27,506
<i>Realize the price that you paid
With your voice</i>

1022
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:30,884
<i>As he turns from you</i>

1023
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:39,268
<i>Those sacrifices you made
Were a choice that you can't undo</i>

1024
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,020
<i>Lost</i>

1025
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:44,523
<i>For the first time</i>

1026
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,316
<i>Scared</i>

1027
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,694
<i>For the first time</i>

1028
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:54,366
<i>Gravity feels like an undertow</i>

1029
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:56,869
<i>Pulling me</i>

1030
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:01,039
<i>Down</i>

1031
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:11,216
This has got to be, without a doubt...

1032
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:14,803
the single most humiliating day of my life!

1033
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:17,305
I could have been fricasseed...

1034
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:21,268
and then, having to climb
all the way up here.

1035
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:23,645
They couldn't give you a room
on the ground floor?

1036
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:29,734
I hope you appreciate what I go through
for you, young lady.

1037
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:30,903
No.

1038
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:32,613
Don't ya turn your back on me.

1039
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:37,033
What were you thinkin',
choosin' to give up your mermaid gifts?

1040
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:39,912
Now, if we could just get that witch
to give them back...

1041
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:42,372
then you could go home and just be...

1042
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:44,416
well, and just be...

1043
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:49,837
just be miserable for the rest of your life.

1044
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:53,926
Oh, my, what a soft shell
I am turnin' out to be.

1045
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:57,304
All right. All right.

1046
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,055
I'll try to help you.

1047
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:01,183
But we've got to be bold, act quickly.

1048
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,018
Don't forget about the kiss.

1049
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:05,770
No, no, not me, the Prince!

1050
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:07,147
You gotta kiss the Prince.

1051
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:08,273
Don't you remember?

1052
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:09,983
You only have three days to...

1053
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:12,361
Hello?

1054
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:14,904
Oh, no!

1055
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:16,990
She's put a spell on you.

1056
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:19,243
You can't remember, can you?

1057
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:21,118
Now, what are we gonna do?

1058
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:23,788
Well, we got no time to lose.

1059
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:27,376
We just got to find a way
to get the two of you together.

1060
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,841
You are hopeless, child.

1061
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:35,008
You know that?

1062
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:38,095
Completely hopeless.

1063
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:49,481
A buffet.

1064
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:53,734
What? No nuts?

1065
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:55,070
What are you doin' here?

1066
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:56,613
Oh, there you are.

1067
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,698
I've been lookin' for you.

1068
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,491
Flounder told me the whole story.

1069
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:01,326
Has Ariel killed the Prince yet?

1070
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:02,911
No, not killed.

1071
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,746
Kissed, ya bird brain.

1072
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:06,206
And it's worse than we thought.

1073
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:07,958
The witch has placed a spell on her.

1074
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,751
Soon as I tell her she's got to kiss him...

1075
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:12,212
the thought jumps clear
right out of her head.

1076
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:13,463
So, now it's up to us.

1077
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:14,840
To kiss the Prince?

1078
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:16,300
Forget it.

1079
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:17,718
Where's Ariel now?

1080
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,303
What do ya mean? She's right...

1081
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:26,722
What are you doin' in here, child?

1082
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,558
You can't just go wanderin' around
wherever you please.

1083
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:30,559
Hide!

1084
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:31,768
Who's in here?

1085
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:41,528
Oh, it's you.

1086
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,203
Nobody usually comes in here.

1087
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:54,124
My little mermaid.

1088
01:12:56,335 --> 01:12:58,253
It's all right, it's all right.

1089
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,838
You can look at it.

1090
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:02,132
I found her on the coast of Cartagena.

1091
01:13:03,342 --> 01:13:04,510
Isn't she beautiful?

1092
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,181
Oh, that's right. You...

1093
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:13,519
Well, it really doesn't matter.

1094
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:17,231
Most people around here use too many words
and have nothing to say.

1095
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:19,942
You know...

1096
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:25,572
I never believed all that lore about
mermaids luring sailors to their deaths.

1097
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,451
Here, take her.

1098
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:32,621
No, really. I want you to have her.

1099
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,499
I'm running out of space as it is.

1100
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,086
Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

1101
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:42,589
I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff...

1102
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:45,801
but just look at this fossilized sea stone.

1103
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:48,637
Can you believe that such amazing things
exist down there?

1104
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:53,517
No, wait!

1105
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:03,318
How did you know that was in there...

1106
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:06,363
all this time?

1107
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:09,908
That's incredible.

1108
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:13,036
-Well, that.
-Hey, girl.

1109
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:15,747
That I just picked up from the beach
here on the island.

1110
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:18,959
There's loads of them at this time of year.

1111
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,968
I had no idea you could do that.

1112
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:31,096
Oh, me?

1113
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:34,433
Really?

1114
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,851
All right, hand...

1115
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:38,270
How do I...

1116
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:40,856
Yeah, that's it.

1117
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,191
That's it, girl.

1118
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:43,734
Go get it, go get it.

1119
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:44,902
I see ya.

1120
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:46,069
Go on, come now...

1121
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,076
Sorry.

1122
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:54,620
Yeah, well...

1123
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:57,247
I'll work on that.

1124
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:00,000
I love the people there.

1125
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,544
Their culture, their custom.

1126
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,756
This whole region is known
as the Brazilian Empire.

1127
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:08,217
Then there's Venezuela...

1128
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:11,178
Colombia...

1129
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:14,640
the area up here is called Mosquito Coast.

1130
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:19,728
Those waters are all uncharted.

1131
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:24,525
Wouldn't it be amazing to discover
someplace no one's ever seen before?

1132
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:30,697
Well, this...

1133
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:32,991
this was one of my favorite voyages.

1134
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,536
I bought that Peruvian rug there...

1135
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,913
along with six of the looms
they used to make it.

1136
01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:40,916
Another one. All right.

1137
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,546
This is our island.

1138
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:48,006
We're in that very castle right now.

1139
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:51,134
Over here's our main village.

1140
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:54,137
Now, our port there was once
the busiest in the region.

1141
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,432
I'm hoping it will be again one day.

1142
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:02,688
And there's a beautiful lagoon
with a little waterfall right here.

1143
01:16:02,855 --> 01:16:05,399
And then all of that is rainforest.

1144
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:09,361
I could show you around, if you like.

1145
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:12,406
All right.

1146
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:13,448
We'll go tomorrow.

1147
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:14,449
But, sire...

1148
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:16,368
Grimsby, good.

1149
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:18,662
We'll need a horse and carriage
ready for us in the morning.

1150
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:21,540
May I have a quiet word, sire?

1151
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,418
Of course.

1152
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:29,214
He's a special one, isn't he?

1153
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:30,883
And that moonlight.

1154
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:38,140
We were going to send out all the carriages
tomorrow to look for the girl.

1155
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,309
The girl!
I wasn't thinking.

1156
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:42,186
Of course, yes, we must do that.

1157
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:44,688
-Absolutely.
-And I must remind you, Eric...

1158
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:47,608
what your mother said yesterday
about you not leaving the castle...

1159
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:50,152
-until you're feeling better.
-Grimsby, I feel fine.

1160
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,029
I feel better than ever.

1161
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,864
Yes.

1162
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:56,408
Yes, I can see that.

1163
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,122
I suppose we could spare one carriage.

1164
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,773
Looks like you made a friend there.

1165
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,483
Come on, Max.

1166
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,901
We'll see you later.

1167
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:32,861
Oh, no. You're not goin' without me.

1168
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,696
I only got two days left.

1169
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:35,989
I'm a crab on a mission.

1170
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:37,783
Trot on, King.

1171
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:43,789
I'm getting too old for this.

1172
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,625
Oh, no, no, no! Down, beast!

1173
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:53,257
I still got it.

1174
01:17:57,678 --> 01:18:00,138
Who is that ridin' out with Prince Eric?

1175
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,099
Is that the girl who washed up the other day?

1176
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:03,684
Yes, it is, Lashana.

1177
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:07,104
Didn't the Queen tell him to
stay in the castle?

1178
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:08,605
Yes, she did, Lashana.

1179
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:11,733
Aren't you going to get into trouble
for fetching him a carriage?

1180
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,402
What carriage, Lashana?

1181
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:40,012
Do you wanna try?

1182
01:18:41,638 --> 01:18:42,639
Here.

1183
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:56,987
Look out! Look out!

1184
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:59,406
Come on! Move, move, move!

1185
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:05,913
Sorry about that!

1186
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,124
That was close.

1187
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,667
Whoa!

1188
01:19:10,834 --> 01:19:12,294
Hey, guys! Get out the way!

1189
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:14,755
-Turn!
-Quickly!

1190
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:15,797
Wait, wait, wait!

1191
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:16,840
Hey, hey, hey. Watch yourself!

1192
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:17,966
Careful!

1193
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:34,650
That was...

1194
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:36,026
fun.

1195
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:37,319
Here, I'll...

1196
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:40,906
Let me give you a hand.

1197
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:42,574
Move, move 'em.

1198
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:43,784
Here we go. This way.

1199
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,244
Come on. This way.

1200
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,330
Here we go.

1201
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:49,540
Go on. That's it.

1202
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:51,917
Thank you, lad.

1203
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:12,604
Island berry?

1204
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,356
How is it? Pretty?

1205
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:17,734
-Coconut!
-Breadfruit!

1206
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:18,735
Coconut!

1207
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:21,989
Fresh coconut?

1208
01:20:23,574 --> 01:20:25,367
No? You don't want it?

1209
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:27,160
Get some water in ya.

1210
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:30,163
Thank you, Miss.

1211
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,249
Young lady, would you like to try some?

1212
01:20:36,128 --> 01:20:37,963
I think you'll be needing this.

1213
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,397
Hey, can I have some salt?

1214
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:57,900
Good day, sire.

1215
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:00,444
How ripe the mango?

1216
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:01,862
Hat for the lady?

1217
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:06,158
Oh. There you are.

1218
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:10,787
No, no. Too big.

1219
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:11,955
Try this.

1220
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:19,963
Tropical flowers?

1221
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:00,128
Hey! Everybody, everybody!

1222
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,130
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey!

1223
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:09,263
Say, any kissing yet?

1224
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:13,141
No. When it comes to romance,
these two are slow as snails.

1225
01:22:13,308 --> 01:22:14,852
Hey, go find Flounder.

1226
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:17,062
We got to move this thing along, and quick.

1227
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:18,730
Okay, bossy.

1228
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:23,610
Hey!

1229
01:22:24,736 --> 01:22:25,571
Hey!

1230
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,908
Bring it here, bring it here,
bring it here now!

1231
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:31,702
Back it up, back it up, back it up!

1232
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,624
Come on, now!

1233
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,059
I love this time of night.

1234
01:22:57,561 --> 01:23:01,398
Sometimes you'll see the eyes
of a screech owl, up in the tree...

1235
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:02,941
Hey! Hey!

1236
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,443
Hey, come back with that!

1237
01:23:05,277 --> 01:23:06,111
Come on.

1238
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:08,739
Watch out.

1239
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,866
I think it went this way.

1240
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,075
You all right?

1241
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:13,076
Hey!

1242
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:15,621
Give me my hat back!

1243
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,045
All right then.

1244
01:23:27,799 --> 01:23:29,176
I didn't want to lose this.

1245
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:47,027
Move your big fat feathers, bird.

1246
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:48,111
I can't see a thing.

1247
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:49,530
Well, that worked pretty good, didn't it?

1248
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:50,822
But nothing's happening.

1249
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:53,325
We're running out of time,
and no one's puckered up once.

1250
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:55,410
I think it's time for a little...

1251
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,996
vocal romantic stimulation.

1252
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:00,624
Please, no.

1253
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,543
-Scuttle? You got to be...
<i>-Me, me, me</i>

1254
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:03,836
<i>Womp chicka womp womp</i>

1255
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:06,046
<i>Chicka womp womp
Chicka womp</i>

1256
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:09,675
<i>Womp womp</i>

1257
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:10,884
-All right. Gosh.
-<i>Womp</i>

1258
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:12,010
-I was off. I was off on that one.
-No.

1259
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:13,887
<i>Womp
</i>Let me find it. Let me find it.

1260
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:14,888
<i>Womp</i>

1261
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,014
Ya finish?

1262
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,015
<i>Womp</i>

1263
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:18,600
All right, all right. Listen.

1264
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:20,561
Ariel cannot know we're helpin'.

1265
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:22,896
If she sees or hears us, she'll shut us down.

1266
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:25,524
Nah, man. We got to be sneaky about this.

1267
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,442
We got to work on the Prince...

1268
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:30,529
-using the power of suggestion.
-Good.

1269
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:32,990
How are we gonna do that?

1270
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:36,994
We got to blend in with the sounds of nature,
so she doesn't hear us.

1271
01:24:38,036 --> 01:24:39,329
Percussion.

1272
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:47,087
Strings.

1273
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:52,551
Winds.

1274
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:59,516
Words.

1275
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:02,686
<i>There you see her</i>

1276
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:05,939
<i>Sitting there across the way</i>

1277
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,358
<i>She don't got a lot to say</i>

1278
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:11,612
<i>But there's something about her</i>

1279
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:15,073
<i>And you don't know why</i>

1280
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,783
<i>But you're dying to try</i>

1281
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:20,120
<i>You wanna kiss the girl</i>

1282
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:26,460
<i>Yes, you want her</i>

1283
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:28,879
<i>Look at her, you know you do</i>

1284
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,216
<i>Possible she wants you, too</i>

1285
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:35,260
<i>Use your words, boy, and ask her</i>

1286
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,303
Do you want to try?

1287
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:38,680
<i>If the time is right</i>

1288
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:40,641
<i>Then the time is tonight</i>

1289
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:42,809
<i>Go on and kiss the girl</i>

1290
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,485
<i>Sha la la la la la, my oh, my</i>

1291
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:53,487
<i>Look like the boy too shy</i>

1292
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:55,906
<i>Ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>

1293
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:57,699
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1294
01:25:57,866 --> 01:25:58,825
<i>Ain't that sad</i>

1295
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,702
<i>Ain't it a shame, too bad</i>

1296
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:02,454
<i>He's gonna miss the girl</i>

1297
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:04,623
Hey, pull it back. Scuttle, pull it back.

1298
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:12,464
What a clear night.

1299
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:15,133
You can see Orion.

1300
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:20,264
The sailors use the constellations
to navigate.

1301
01:26:21,807 --> 01:26:23,642
That one's Orion, the hunter.

1302
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:28,438
There's Aries, the ram.

1303
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:31,984
That's Cassiopeia.

1304
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:34,486
That's funny.

1305
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:36,655
I still don't know your name.

1306
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:41,034
Let's see. Is it...

1307
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,036
Diana?

1308
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:45,289
No?

1309
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,833
Or...

1310
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,085
Katherine?

1311
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:52,963
No, definitely not Katherine.

1312
01:26:55,007 --> 01:26:56,341
How...

1313
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:01,513
Sky...

1314
01:27:06,852 --> 01:27:07,853
Aries?

1315
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:09,897
Aries.

1316
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:11,982
Arie...

1317
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:14,443
Ari-el.

1318
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:17,154
Ariel?

1319
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:20,073
Ari-el?

1320
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:22,993
Ariel.

1321
01:27:25,871 --> 01:27:27,331
That's a beautiful name.

1322
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:33,670
Written in the stars.

1323
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:42,179
<i>Now's your moment</i>

1324
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:45,766
<i>Floating in a blue lagoon</i>

1325
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,977
-<i>Boy, do it soon
-Boy, you better do it soon</i>

1326
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:52,689
<i>No time will be better</i>

1327
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:55,400
<i>She don't say a word</i>

1328
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,195
<i>And she won't say a word until you</i>

1329
01:27:58,362 --> 01:27:59,863
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1330
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,740
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1331
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:04,576
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1332
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:07,037
<i>Sha la la la la</i>

1333
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:08,163
<i>Don't be scared</i>

1334
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,998
<i>You got the mood prepared</i>

1335
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:12,042
<i>-Go on and kiss the girl
-Kiss the girl</i>

1336
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:13,043
<i>Wow, wow</i>

1337
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,378
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1338
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:15,546
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1339
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:17,840
<i>Don't try to hide it
How you wanna</i>

1340
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:19,633
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1341
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:21,677
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1342
01:28:21,844 --> 01:28:22,928
<i>Float along</i>

1343
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,596
<i>And listen to the song</i>

1344
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:25,597
<i>The song say</i>

1345
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:27,599
<i>"Kiss the girl"</i>

1346
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:28,809
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1347
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:30,227
<i>The music play</i>

1348
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:32,020
<i>Do what the music say</i>

1349
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:33,021
<i>You gotta</i>

1350
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,566
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1351
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:36,567
<i>You gotta</i>

1352
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:39,152
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1353
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:40,237
<i>Why don't you</i>

1354
01:28:40,404 --> 01:28:42,072
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1355
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:43,907
<i>Come on and</i>

1356
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:45,909
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1357
01:28:46,076 --> 01:28:47,494
<i>Go on and</i>

1358
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,954
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1359
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,421
What was that?

1360
01:29:06,054 --> 01:29:07,806
That was close.

1361
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:09,224
Too close.

1362
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:12,436
I don't get it.

1363
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:14,980
I didn't think that little barracuda
stood a chance...

1364
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:17,941
luring him in without her voice.

1365
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:20,319
How's that even possible?

1366
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,738
Well, we're not gonna let that happen again.

1367
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,409
It's time Ursula took matters
into her own tentacles.

1368
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:29,119
Where is it?

1369
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:32,206
Come on, come on.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

1370
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:34,166
No! No!

1371
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:38,420
Nobody ever puts my things back!

1372
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:42,758
No! Where is it?

1373
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,894
No, no, no!

1374
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:57,439
No!

1375
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:59,024
Oh, there it is.

1376
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:00,192
I got it.

1377
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:03,737
That Prince won't know what hit him.

1378
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:08,283
Only one more sunset...

1379
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,619
and then I'll make Triton writhe.

1380
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:16,542
I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook.

1381
01:30:25,676 --> 01:30:26,593
So where is she?

1382
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,470
-We don't know, Father.
-She's gone.

1383
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:29,888
What do you mean, she's gone?

1384
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:31,306
We've been looking and looking.

1385
01:30:31,473 --> 01:30:33,725
There's no sign of her anywhere.
She's not in these waters.

1386
01:30:33,892 --> 01:30:34,768
Then look again.

1387
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:37,062
Search all of the Seven Seas if you have to.

1388
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:41,441
-Ariel wouldn't dare go above again.
-Don't even think such a thing.

1389
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:45,195
Doesn't make sense. Why would she leave?

1390
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:46,363
I have no idea.

1391
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,615
Never mind that. Just find her.

1392
01:31:12,556 --> 01:31:14,266
What have I done?

1393
01:31:27,154 --> 01:31:28,655
Everyone's asleep.

1394
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:29,823
We should probably be quiet.

1395
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,950
-In his room, all day?
-Wait.

1396
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:33,952
-Go. Oh, no. Go, go. Go in there. Go.
-I haven't seen him once.

1397
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:35,913
-Careful.
-I imagine he's just resting.

1398
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,247
Has he been avoiding me?

1399
01:31:37,414 --> 01:31:38,457
No, Your Majesty.

1400
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,458
-No?
-No.

1401
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:41,001
-No?
-No.

1402
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,628
You seem awfully certain.

1403
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:44,880
Avoiding you?
Doesn't seem like Eric, does it?

1404
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:46,048
Then where is he?

1405
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:49,218
Oh, he's not searching for
that fantasy girl, I hope.

1406
01:31:50,844 --> 01:31:51,887
No, Your Majesty.

1407
01:31:52,054 --> 01:31:53,722
That I can say with certainty.

1408
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:55,599
Thank heavens for small blessings.

1409
01:31:57,518 --> 01:31:58,519
It's wet.

1410
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:00,479
I will look into it.

1411
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:02,856
You really must get some rest yourself.

1412
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:04,566
Yes, I suppose I should.

1413
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:06,485
Thank you, Grimsby. Good night.

1414
01:32:06,652 --> 01:32:07,694
Ma'am.

1415
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:09,530
Sorry about that.

1416
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:12,407
I wasn't supposed to leave the castle today.

1417
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:13,825
But I'm glad I did.

1418
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:17,412
All these rules...

1419
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:22,084
The truth is, I wasn't born to all this...

1420
01:32:22,251 --> 01:32:23,544
and it all makes me feel a little uneasy...

1421
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,963
-Welcome back, sire.
-Oh, Grimsby.

1422
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:31,176
I trust you two had a pleasant outing.

1423
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:32,636
Yes, we did.
Didn't we?

1424
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:34,471
Yes. Very nice.

1425
01:32:34,638 --> 01:32:36,014
You've had a long day, Miss.

1426
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:38,559
I imagine we should let you get some sleep.

1427
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:40,936
And perhaps dried off as well.

1428
01:32:41,937 --> 01:32:44,314
Yes. We took a rowboat out onto the lagoon...

1429
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:46,191
and I'm afraid we ended up in it.

1430
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,236
Anyway, good night.

1431
01:32:58,787 --> 01:32:59,788
Good night...

1432
01:33:00,956 --> 01:33:02,207
Ariel.

1433
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:11,091
About the carriages, sire...

1434
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:13,051
I'm afraid they...

1435
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:16,054
didn't find the mystery girl.

1436
01:33:17,097 --> 01:33:18,098
They didn't?

1437
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:24,521
May I then ask...

1438
01:33:24,688 --> 01:33:26,732
should we continue the search?

1439
01:33:29,276 --> 01:33:30,277
Grimsby...

1440
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:32,738
I just...

1441
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:35,324
I feel a little...

1442
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:40,162
Well, if you want the advice
of an old man, sire...

1443
01:33:41,413 --> 01:33:44,124
don't be held back
by what you think should be.

1444
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,752
Think only of what is.

1445
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:49,213
Good night, sire.

1446
01:36:18,403 --> 01:36:20,364
Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

1447
01:36:20,531 --> 01:36:21,698
What?

1448
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:23,200
<i>Hey, have you not heard the scuttlebutt?</i>

1449
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,243
Your butt?

1450
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:25,827
<i>No, the gossip, the buzz</i>

1451
01:36:25,994 --> 01:36:28,622
<i>The who-said-what-who-does-that
Yeah, the scuttlebutt</i>

1452
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:31,792
<i>Well, I was flying over land and sea
An ear to the ground</i>

1453
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:35,170
<i>Then I came flying here for you to see
And hear what I found</i>

1454
01:36:35,337 --> 01:36:36,421
<i>Remember the swamp?</i>

1455
01:36:36,588 --> 01:36:38,173
<i>Remember my song in the swamp
When I was like</i>

1456
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,467
<i>"Womp chicka womp womp chicka womp womp"</i>

1457
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:41,468
I remember.

1458
01:36:41,635 --> 01:36:42,678
<i>Well, ever since</i>

1459
01:36:42,845 --> 01:36:44,805
<i>The what's his name?
The guy with the hair and the shirt</i>

1460
01:36:45,264 --> 01:36:46,515
-The Prince.
-<i>Yeah, the Prince</i>

1461
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:48,642
<i>Has been dropping hints
He wants to</i>

1462
01:36:48,809 --> 01:36:51,478
<i>You know when humans
Dress all nice like they're penguins?</i>

1463
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:52,729
<i>Throw rice for the pigeons?</i>

1464
01:36:52,896 --> 01:36:54,273
<i>They're trying to blow up the pigeons</i>

1465
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:55,858
<i>But those are just urban legends</i>

1466
01:36:56,024 --> 01:36:57,985
<i>I know a lot of really fat pigeons</i>

1467
01:36:58,151 --> 01:37:00,737
-Scuttle...
-<i>Will you just listen, Sebastian?</i>

1468
01:37:00,904 --> 01:37:01,864
<i>I got the scuttlebutt</i>

1469
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:02,865
Hurry up.

1470
01:37:03,031 --> 01:37:05,450
<i>You'll be like, "What?"
When I drop that scuttlebutt</i>

1471
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:07,494
<i>Okay, now, huddle up, buttercup</i>

1472
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:09,079
<i>From the women who wash all the clothes</i>

1473
01:37:09,246 --> 01:37:10,664
<i>To the hunter who arrows the bows</i>

1474
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:11,915
<i>The chatter all over the palace</i>

1475
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,667
<i>Is that your Prince Eric is gonna propose</i>

1476
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:15,502
-What?
-<i>To somebody nobody knows</i>

1477
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:16,753
<i>They're saying he suddenly chose</i>

1478
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,505
-Who?
-<i>Who? You sound like an owl</i>

1479
01:37:18,672 --> 01:37:21,008
<i>-I'll bet it's the kid with the new set of toes
-</i>No!

1480
01:37:21,175 --> 01:37:23,260
<i>Oh, yes, anything goes
Who'd ever guess</i>

1481
01:37:23,427 --> 01:37:24,887
<i>Our little Ariel's marriage material?</i>

1482
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:27,014
<i>Time for the rice and the dress
And the what do you call it?</i>

1483
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:29,224
<i>The thing with the lips, when they press</i>

1484
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:30,976
<i>I don't have lips, I have a beak</i>

1485
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:32,519
<i>So I guess I could give you
A peck on the cheek</i>

1486
01:37:32,686 --> 01:37:33,896
I don't believe it.

1487
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:35,898
Say, you're awfully quiet.

1488
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,775
Oh, yeah. So, what now?

1489
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:40,027
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1490
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:42,070
<i>Can you believe the scuttlebutt?</i>

1491
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:43,655
Get dressed, child.

1492
01:37:43,822 --> 01:37:45,157
<i>You're welcome for the scuttlebutt</i>

1493
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:47,659
We got a lot of work to do before sundown.

1494
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:49,161
<i>The scuttlebutt, scuttlebutt, hey!</i>

1495
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:51,455
Oh, please let this be the day.

1496
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:53,123
<i>-Let's go, let's go, let's go
-Let's go</i>

1497
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:55,501
<i>We got it, the gossip, the buzz</i>

1498
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:57,836
<i>The who-said-what-who-does-that
Yeah, I told you so</i>

1499
01:37:58,045 --> 01:37:58,879
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go</i>

1500
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:00,297
<i>We gotta go before the sun goes down</i>

1501
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:02,007
<i>What? Got to get her ready
For the big showdown</i>

1502
01:38:02,174 --> 01:38:03,091
<i>-Right
-Go ahead and get her out of bed</i>

1503
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,219
<i>And get her ready for the wedding
Sun is setting so we can't slow down</i>

1504
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:06,970
<i>The scuttlebutt</i>

1505
01:38:12,809 --> 01:38:14,061
Scuttle, you're too close.

1506
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:28,700
My goodness, it is wonderful news.

1507
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:30,702
-Isn't it, Grimsby?
-Oh, yes.

1508
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:33,789
I must admit, I was mistaken.

1509
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:38,085
It seems you really have found the girl
of your dreams after all.

1510
01:38:38,252 --> 01:38:41,004
Yes. Quite the surprise, Eric.

1511
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,131
What?

1512
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:45,175
I know.

1513
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:46,927
I know it must seem fast...

1514
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:49,555
but I do owe her my life.

1515
01:38:49,721 --> 01:38:50,722
We will celebrate.

1516
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:52,015
This evening.

1517
01:38:52,182 --> 01:38:54,768
You shall introduce your intended
to the court.

1518
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:57,145
We can make that happen, can't we, Grimsby?

1519
01:38:57,312 --> 01:39:00,399
Yes. If it's really what you want, Eric.

1520
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,735
What I... want?

1521
01:39:06,905 --> 01:39:08,532
It's what we both want.

1522
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:10,909
Lovely.

1523
01:39:11,076 --> 01:39:13,161
Well, we've got our work cut out for us.

1524
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:14,162
Indeed.

1525
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:16,707
Then let's begin preparations. Grimsby...

1526
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:22,254
Oh, Ariel, girl.

1527
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:23,672
Where have you gone?

1528
01:39:25,048 --> 01:39:26,800
-Yeah. Any sign of her?
-No luck.

1529
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:28,719
I flew over the village three times.

1530
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:30,304
Well, check the castle again!

1531
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:32,639
It's almost sunset. We got to find her.

1532
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:33,640
Copy that.

1533
01:39:33,807 --> 01:39:35,434
What's wrong with that fool Prince?

1534
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:36,977
Something fishy going on here.

1535
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:38,270
-I don't like the smell of it...
-Sebastian!

1536
01:39:38,437 --> 01:39:39,354
-Over here.
-Yeah, what?

1537
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:40,564
I coming, I coming. Hold on.

1538
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:42,065
Yes, what?

1539
01:39:42,232 --> 01:39:43,817
I think I know where Ariel is.

1540
01:39:43,984 --> 01:39:45,152
Well, what are we waiting for?

1541
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:46,653
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1542
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,289
Ariel?

1543
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:31,907
So long, Red.

1544
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:41,291
Oh, no!

1545
01:41:08,277 --> 01:41:10,696
<i>Risking it all</i>

1546
01:41:10,863 --> 01:41:13,198
<i>Only to fall</i>

1547
01:41:13,365 --> 01:41:17,119
<i>Back where I started</i>

1548
01:41:17,286 --> 01:41:19,288
<i>Back near the shore</i>

1549
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:21,623
<i>Back to before</i>

1550
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:25,335
<i>You took my hand</i>

1551
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:28,505
<i>Bet ya on land</i>

1552
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:30,674
<i>They understand</i>

1553
01:41:30,841 --> 01:41:36,763
<i>And they don't strand you brokenhearted</i>

1554
01:41:39,183 --> 01:41:43,312
<i>What did I give to live where you are?</i>

1555
01:41:44,396 --> 01:41:49,860
<i>Where do I go with nowhere to turn to?</i>

1556
01:41:57,034 --> 01:41:59,036
Hey, what are you doin', child?

1557
01:41:59,203 --> 01:42:01,246
You can't give up so easily.

1558
01:42:01,413 --> 01:42:04,082
This all has to be
some sort of misunderstanding.

1559
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:05,792
I watched both of you.

1560
01:42:05,959 --> 01:42:07,586
You're meant to be together.

1561
01:42:07,753 --> 01:42:08,629
There you are.

1562
01:42:08,795 --> 01:42:09,713
I've been lookin'.

1563
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,007
And I thought I found you, 'cause I heard.

1564
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:14,676
But then I saw it wasn't you.

1565
01:42:14,843 --> 01:42:15,719
It was her!

1566
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:16,720
But it wasn't...

1567
01:42:16,845 --> 01:42:18,430
In the mirror, except she had...

1568
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:19,473
She had your voice!

1569
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,891
What are you talkin' about?

1570
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:23,769
-Don't you get what I'm tellin' you?
-No!

1571
01:42:23,936 --> 01:42:25,646
The Prince has been tricked.

1572
01:42:25,812 --> 01:42:29,274
That lady who showed up is actually
the Sea Witch in disguise.

1573
01:42:29,775 --> 01:42:30,901
Are you sure about this?

1574
01:42:31,068 --> 01:42:32,402
Of course I'm sure!

1575
01:42:32,569 --> 01:42:33,737
Have I ever been wrong?

1576
01:42:33,904 --> 01:42:35,614
I mean, like, you know, when it counts?

1577
01:42:35,781 --> 01:42:37,282
Well, what are we gonna do?

1578
01:42:37,449 --> 01:42:38,617
Well, we have to do something...

1579
01:42:38,784 --> 01:42:41,995
before Prince Eric ends up
with that slimy squid.

1580
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:43,747
Yes, girl, go!

1581
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:45,999
Flounder, go tell the Sea King
what's happened.

1582
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:47,417
He has to know everything.

1583
01:42:47,584 --> 01:42:48,544
Okay.

1584
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:49,920
What do I do?

1585
01:42:50,087 --> 01:42:51,588
You give me a lift to the castle.

1586
01:42:52,172 --> 01:42:55,384
We got to find a way
to stall that engagement.

1587
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,101
Really is very special.

1588
01:43:04,268 --> 01:43:06,478
Heroism's too strong a word for it...

1589
01:43:08,021 --> 01:43:09,857
but I suppose I did save Eric.

1590
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:12,693
-That's what anyone would do.
-Of course.

1591
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,152
-Grimsby.
-Sire.

1592
01:43:14,945 --> 01:43:16,196
Have you seen Ariel?

1593
01:43:16,363 --> 01:43:18,949
According to the servants,
she left the castle early this morning.

1594
01:43:19,116 --> 01:43:20,158
Left?

1595
01:43:20,325 --> 01:43:21,994
Can you blame her, Eric?

1596
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,538
I don't understand. This is not like you.

1597
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,124
I'm not sure I understand it myself.

1598
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:30,210
I just wanted to...

1599
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:31,670
-I thought if...
-Eric.

1600
01:43:32,754 --> 01:43:33,589
Thank you.

1601
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:38,093
I don't really know what I wanted.

1602
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:48,937
Almost there!

1603
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:52,941
Now, when I give the signal, you drop me!

1604
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:54,318
-Got it?
-Got it.

1605
01:43:54,484 --> 01:43:56,195
No, you idiot...

1606
01:43:57,571 --> 01:43:58,989
Guess I'm on my own.

1607
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:04,077
My darling...

1608
01:44:04,244 --> 01:44:07,414
this belonged to my mother.

1609
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:09,333
And I'd like you to have it.

1610
01:44:10,334 --> 01:44:13,212
Your happiness means everything to me.

1611
01:44:13,378 --> 01:44:14,421
You're very sweet.

1612
01:44:15,797 --> 01:44:17,132
Would you excuse me?

1613
01:44:23,388 --> 01:44:24,473
Enjoy yourself.

1614
01:44:27,768 --> 01:44:29,144
Oh, Eric.

1615
01:44:29,311 --> 01:44:30,604
It's beautiful.

1616
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:35,317
-What in the...
-The ring.

1617
01:44:35,484 --> 01:44:36,944
The ring. I lost...

1618
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:38,779
Has anybody seen the ring?

1619
01:44:38,946 --> 01:44:39,863
Have you seen the ring?

1620
01:44:40,906 --> 01:44:41,865
Have you seen it?

1621
01:44:43,617 --> 01:44:45,452
Get off me, you filthy bird!

1622
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:53,919
Help me! I'm being attacked!

1623
01:44:56,088 --> 01:44:57,047
Ariel!

1624
01:44:57,214 --> 01:44:58,674
Ariel, I've been looking for you.

1625
01:44:58,841 --> 01:44:59,842
Who is that?

1626
01:45:01,218 --> 01:45:02,344
What are you doing?

1627
01:45:03,762 --> 01:45:04,972
-Grimsby, let me go!
-Sire!

1628
01:45:05,138 --> 01:45:06,306
Get her away from me!

1629
01:45:06,473 --> 01:45:07,474
She's insane!

1630
01:45:08,141 --> 01:45:08,976
What's going on?

1631
01:45:09,351 --> 01:45:10,310
Ariel, stop!

1632
01:45:13,313 --> 01:45:14,314
Get off!

1633
01:45:46,346 --> 01:45:47,598
Ariel.

1634
01:45:48,682 --> 01:45:50,267
Yes.

1635
01:45:51,185 --> 01:45:52,394
It was you all along.

1636
01:45:53,937 --> 01:45:54,938
I should've known.

1637
01:45:57,191 --> 01:45:58,942
I don't know what came over me.

1638
01:45:59,109 --> 01:46:00,235
She bewitched you.

1639
01:46:00,402 --> 01:46:01,695
Get away from her!

1640
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:03,030
Eric, I want you to know I...

1641
01:46:03,197 --> 01:46:04,448
Oh, just kiss!

1642
01:46:04,615 --> 01:46:06,491
-I want you to know everything.
-Nothing matters now.

1643
01:46:08,744 --> 01:46:09,703
No!

1644
01:46:23,926 --> 01:46:26,553
Oh, good Lord. She's a sea creature.

1645
01:46:27,262 --> 01:46:29,515
You're too late!

1646
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:33,310
You're too late!

1647
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,321
Stay back!

1648
01:46:44,488 --> 01:46:45,697
Shut up!

1649
01:46:48,033 --> 01:46:49,326
Eric!

1650
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:57,918
Eric, no.

1651
01:46:58,085 --> 01:47:00,212
This is the work of the sea gods.
I warned you.

1652
01:47:00,379 --> 01:47:01,839
Their whole world is evil.

1653
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:04,258
Eric, wait! Eric!

1654
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:09,888
What are you doing? Let go of me!

1655
01:47:10,055 --> 01:47:12,516
Not a chance. You made a deal, remember?

1656
01:47:12,683 --> 01:47:14,184
Three days, no kiss.

1657
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:17,604
Yeah, is it all comin' back to ya?

1658
01:47:18,814 --> 01:47:20,107
I thought so.

1659
01:47:20,274 --> 01:47:22,484
Well, now you gotta live with it, toots.

1660
01:47:34,872 --> 01:47:36,540
Ursula!

1661
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:40,419
Let her go.

1662
01:47:40,586 --> 01:47:42,254
Forget it, Big Brother.

1663
01:47:42,421 --> 01:47:44,923
She belongs to me now.

1664
01:47:49,428 --> 01:47:51,054
Oh, you see?

1665
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,140
We made a deal.

1666
01:47:53,307 --> 01:47:54,558
In blood.

1667
01:47:54,725 --> 01:47:57,436
It's unbreakable, even for you.

1668
01:47:57,936 --> 01:48:00,272
I'm sorry, Father. This is all my fault.

1669
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:02,149
What do you want with my daughter?

1670
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:05,235
Nothing.

1671
01:48:05,402 --> 01:48:07,196
It's you I want.

1672
01:48:07,362 --> 01:48:11,325
I want to see you suffer,
like I've suffered all these years.

1673
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:15,662
And the daughter of the great Sea King...

1674
01:48:15,829 --> 01:48:18,248
is a very precious commodity.

1675
01:48:18,999 --> 01:48:21,210
Poor, unfortunate soul.

1676
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:23,504
Hey!
Get her, boys!

1677
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:29,718
I wouldn't.

1678
01:48:31,929 --> 01:48:33,138
Shocking, isn't it?

1679
01:48:34,723 --> 01:48:38,477
Of course, I always was
a gal with an eye for a bargain.

1680
01:48:38,894 --> 01:48:42,022
What do you say to a trade, hmm?

1681
01:48:42,189 --> 01:48:44,608
What's your precious little Ariel
worth to ya?

1682
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:00,832
It's mine now.

1683
01:49:07,297 --> 01:49:08,507
No!

1684
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:12,135
Father!

1685
01:49:29,778 --> 01:49:31,280
You monster!

1686
01:49:33,574 --> 01:49:35,492
Don't be a fool, you little brat!

1687
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:37,828
You are powerless against...

1688
01:49:39,705 --> 01:49:41,415
You're gonna pay for that.

1689
01:49:42,624 --> 01:49:43,625
Get him!

1690
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:55,762
Say goodbye to your human heartthrob.

1691
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:56,930
Don't!

1692
01:50:00,434 --> 01:50:01,476
My babies!

1693
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:30,756
Eric!

1694
01:50:37,262 --> 01:50:38,847
Get to shore. She'll kill you!

1695
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:40,599
I'm not leaving you!

1696
01:50:53,403 --> 01:50:56,073
Yes!

1697
01:50:56,615 --> 01:50:57,991
Give me your hand!

1698
01:51:01,578 --> 01:51:02,412
Now!

1699
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:14,341
Look out!

1700
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:21,098
Now I rule the seas...

1701
01:51:21,265 --> 01:51:25,477
and all will be helpless under my power!

1702
01:51:29,898 --> 01:51:30,899
No!

1703
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:35,070
So much for true love.

1704
01:52:39,134 --> 01:52:41,678
So long, lover boy.

1705
01:55:24,091 --> 01:55:26,385
You gave your life for me.

1706
01:55:29,513 --> 01:55:32,391
And you fought to get my life back.

1707
01:55:35,686 --> 01:55:37,563
I didn't fight alone, Father.

1708
01:55:39,106 --> 01:55:41,567
Eric was with me.

1709
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:48,782
All that matters now is
that you're safe and home.

1710
01:55:50,576 --> 01:55:51,869
Where you belong.

1711
01:56:25,819 --> 01:56:26,820
Sire, please!

1712
01:56:26,987 --> 01:56:27,905
We need a boat.

1713
01:56:28,071 --> 01:56:30,115
Grimsby, we have to find her!

1714
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:31,408
And then what?

1715
01:56:36,538 --> 01:56:39,666
And then what, Eric?

1716
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:43,337
Darling.

1717
01:56:45,088 --> 01:56:46,298
You were right.

1718
01:56:48,008 --> 01:56:50,594
-I was chasing after a fantasy girl.
-No.

1719
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:53,180
No, I was wrong.

1720
01:56:53,347 --> 01:56:54,723
She was very real.

1721
01:56:55,557 --> 01:56:57,935
And so were your feelings for her,
I see that now.

1722
01:56:59,394 --> 01:57:00,521
It's just that...

1723
01:57:03,065 --> 01:57:05,526
our worlds were never meant to be together.

1724
01:57:52,197 --> 01:57:53,657
Sebastian!

1725
01:57:58,370 --> 01:58:00,289
You gotta be kidding me.

1726
01:58:13,635 --> 01:58:15,262
Yes, Your Majesty.

1727
01:58:17,139 --> 01:58:20,726
I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

1728
01:58:20,893 --> 01:58:22,603
Yes, Your Majesty.

1729
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,647
And what's best for my daughters.

1730
01:58:25,814 --> 01:58:27,482
Indeed, Your Majesty.

1731
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:32,988
And I've done everything in my power
to make her happy.

1732
01:58:35,616 --> 01:58:38,493
Well, not quite.

1733
01:58:47,044 --> 01:58:49,463
She wants a different life
than I had planned for her.

1734
01:58:50,172 --> 01:58:52,841
She did try to tell you, Your Majesty.

1735
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:57,429
But I won't be able to protect her anymore.

1736
01:58:57,596 --> 01:58:59,640
Well, it's like I always say...

1737
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:02,893
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

1738
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,603
Oh, is that what you always say?

1739
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:05,938
Somethin' like that. Yeah.

1740
01:59:09,858 --> 01:59:12,361
Then there's just one problem left.

1741
01:59:12,528 --> 01:59:14,446
And what's that, Your Majesty?

1742
01:59:16,073 --> 01:59:18,367
How much I'm going to miss my little one.

1743
01:59:50,941 --> 01:59:52,568
Good boy. Go on.

1744
02:00:03,871 --> 02:00:04,872
Again?

1745
02:00:18,927 --> 02:00:19,928
Max?

1746
02:01:17,819 --> 02:01:19,821
Blessings to you both.

1747
02:01:20,822 --> 02:01:22,241
Magical news, yeah.

1748
02:01:22,407 --> 02:01:23,784
Oh, what's all this, Grims?

1749
02:01:23,951 --> 02:01:27,788
Oh, the Queen wanted the two of you
to have a proper send-off, sire.

1750
02:01:27,955 --> 02:01:29,331
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1751
02:01:29,498 --> 02:01:31,917
No. Thank you.

1752
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:36,463
Much as I hate farewells,
we still have cause to celebrate.

1753
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:40,801
Our worlds have misunderstood one another
for far too long.

1754
02:01:40,968 --> 02:01:43,929
Your marriage marks a new beginning for us.

1755
02:01:44,096 --> 02:01:46,265
Yes. A beginning.

1756
02:01:47,015 --> 02:01:48,016
Now...

1757
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,060
get out there...

1758
02:01:50,227 --> 02:01:51,728
and change the world...

1759
02:01:51,895 --> 02:01:54,064
or whatever it is you have to do,
so we don't get left behind.

1760
02:01:54,982 --> 02:01:57,234
That doesn't sound like my mother.
What have you done with her?

1761
02:01:59,027 --> 02:02:00,237
Off you go.

1762
02:02:01,446 --> 02:02:03,740
Have you decided where you're headed first?

1763
02:02:05,367 --> 02:02:06,785
Uncharted waters.

1764
02:02:06,952 --> 02:02:07,870
Okay!

1765
02:02:08,036 --> 02:02:09,288
A mermaid and a man.

1766
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:11,915
Whoever would have imagined?

1767
02:02:16,086 --> 02:02:17,754
Well, look who's here.

1768
02:02:18,338 --> 02:02:20,215
-We got you something, Ariel.
-Sure did.

1769
02:02:20,382 --> 02:02:22,176
Something you almost lost.

1770
02:02:22,342 --> 02:02:23,302
Where is it?

1771
02:02:23,468 --> 02:02:25,137
You're sittin' on it, bird.

1772
02:02:27,973 --> 02:02:29,558
My little mermaid.

1773
02:02:32,394 --> 02:02:33,979
Keep her for me.

1774
02:02:34,146 --> 02:02:36,648
I hope she causes you less trouble
than I did.

1775
02:02:36,815 --> 02:02:39,067
I was right about the dinglehopper, wasn't I?

1776
02:02:39,568 --> 02:02:41,695
Yes, you were, Scuttle. You were.

1777
02:02:41,862 --> 02:02:43,280
You won't be gone too long...

1778
02:02:43,739 --> 02:02:45,616
-will you, Ariel?
-Of course not.

1779
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:48,202
I'll be back by the next Coral Moon.

1780
02:02:48,368 --> 02:02:50,495
