1
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,968
"PROMETHEUS STOLE FIRE FROM THE GODS AND GAVE IT TO MAN."

2
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,801
"FOR THIS HE WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK AND TORTURED FOR ETERNITY."

3
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:49,550
Dr. Oppenheimer.

4
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:52,466
Dr. Oppenheimer.

5
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,216
As we begin, I believe you have a statement to read into the record.

6
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,424
Yes, your honor.

7
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:03,633
-We're not judges, Doctor.
-No.

8
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,883
Members of the security board,

9
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,883
the so-called interrogatory information in your indictment of me

10
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,758
cannot be fairly understood except in the context

11
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,800
of my life, and my work.

12
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,050
How long did he testify?

13
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:26,716
Honestly, I forget.

14
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,425
The whole hearing took a month.

15
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,591
-An ordeal.
-Oh, I've only read the transcripts.

16
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,966
-Who'd want to justify their whole life?
-You weren't there?

17
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,758
As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

18
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:43,133
Are they really going to ask about it?

19
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,466
It was years ago.

20
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:46,925
-Four years ago.
-Five.

21
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:49,801
Oppenheimer still divides America.

22
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,824
The committee's going to want to know where you stood.

23
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:56,425
Senator Thurmond asked me to say not to feel that you're on trial.

24
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,550
Oh, funny. I didn't, until you just said that.

25
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,425
-Really, Mr. Strauss...
-It's Admiral.

26
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:04,841
Admiral. Admiral Strauss, this is a formality.

27
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:06,966
President Eisenhower has asked you to be in his cabinet.

28
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:08,967
The Senate really has no choice but to confirm him.

29
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,758
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?

30
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:13,717
When they bring up Oppenheimer, you answer honestly,

31
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,800
no senator can deny you did your duty.

32
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,550
It'll be uncomfortable.

33
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:20,091
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

34
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:27,425
Why did you leave the United States?

35
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:33,425
I... I wanted to study the new physics.

36
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,883
Was there nowhere here?

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,633
I thought Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department.

38
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,300
Yes, once I built it.

39
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,301
But first I had to go to Europe.

40
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,383
I went to Cambridge, to study under Patrick Blackett.

41
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,466
Were you happier there than in America?

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,133
-Happier?
-Yes.

43
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:56,591
No.

44
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,258
No, I, uh...

45
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:03,133
I was homesick and...

46
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,716
emotionally immature...

47
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,425
Troubled by visions of a...

48
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:12,466
hidden universe.

49
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,133
Useless in the lab.

50
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,591
Christ, Oppenheimer.

51
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:33,966
Have you had any sleep?

52
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,592
Start again.

53
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:39,383
I need to go to a lecture, sir.

54
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:41,425
Why?

55
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:42,966
It's Niels Bohr.

56
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,216
I completely forgot.

57
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,133
Alright! Let's go.

58
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:54,091
Oh no, not you, Oppenheimer.

59
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:55,758
You finish coating those plates.

60
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,926
Quantum physics is not a step forward.

61
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:43,758
It is a new way to understand reality.

62
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,676
Einstein's opened the door.

63
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,900
Now we are peering through, seeing a world inside our world,

64
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:55,675
a world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept.

65
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,174
You alright?

66
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,508
Nils, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

67
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,383
What's the J stand for?

68
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:46,926
Nothing, apparently.

69
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,425
You were at my lecture. You asked the only good question.

70
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,050
No one's denying his insight.

71
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,591
It's his laboratory work that leaves a little to be desired.

72
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:55,926
I heard you give the same answer...

73
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,966
At Harvard, yes, and you asked the same question.

74
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,633
Why ask again?

75
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,050
I hadn't liked your answer.

76
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,133
-Did you like it better yesterday?
-A lot.

77
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:09,925
You can lift a stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed.

78
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:11,633
Now it seems you're ready.

79
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,800
But you don't enjoy the lab.

80
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,551
So get out of Cambridge, with its beakers and potions.

81
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,758
Go somewhere they'll let you think.

82
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,175
Where?

83
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,466
-Göttingen.
-Born.

84
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,567
Born.

85
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:30,633
Get to Germany, study under Max Born, learn the ways of theory.

86
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,425
I'll send word.

87
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:34,383
Worm hole.

88
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:37,800
How's your mathematics?

89
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,925
Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be.

90
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,384
Algebra's like sheet music,

91
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:46,008
the important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it.

92
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,383
Can you hear the music, Robert?

93
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:50,885
Yes, I can.

94
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,100
艾略特 《荒原》（1922）

95
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,300
毕加索 《交叉双臂坐着的女人》

96
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
斯特拉文斯基 《春之祭》（1913）

97
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
The senator from Wyoming.

98
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:32,425
Admiral Strauss, I'm interested in your relationship

99
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:34,133
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

100
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:36,091
You met him in 1947.

101
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,008
Correct.

102
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,466
You were a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission.

103
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,769
I was, but I actually met Robert in my capacity

104
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:48,966
as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. It was...

105
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:52,858
after the war, he was world-renowned as the great man of physics,

106
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,175
and I was determined to get him to run the Institute.

107
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,341
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

108
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:10,634
Mr. Strauss.

109
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:11,800
It's pronounced "Strauss".

110
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,426
"Oppenheimer", "Oppenheimer"...

111
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,341
Either way you say it, they know I'm Jewish.

112
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,341
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.

113
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,925
"Strauss" is just a Southern pronunciation.

114
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:27,091
Anyway, welcome to the Institute. I think you'll be very happy here.

115
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:28,675
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.

116
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:31,425
The position comes with that house for you and your wife,

117
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,675
and your... is it two children?

118
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,841
Yes, two.

119
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,425
I'm a great admirer of your work.

120
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:40,425
You're a physicist by training, Mr. Strauss?

121
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,551
I'm sorry, uh, common room, four o'clock tea.

122
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:45,214
No, I'm not trained in physics or anything else.

123
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,276
I'm a self-made man.

124
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,841
Ah, I can relate to that.

125
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,341
-Really?
-Yes, my father was one.

126
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,466
And this would be your office.

127
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,050
I'm told he's there in most afternoons.

128
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,343
You know, I've always wondered

129
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,300
why you didn't involve him in the Manhattan Project.

130
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:15,258
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

131
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,925
Of his time.

132
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,050
Einstein published his Theory of Relativity

133
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,633
more than 40 years ago now.

134
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:25,925
Could never embrace the quantum world it revealed.

135
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:27,758
"God doesn't play dice."

136
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,592
Precisely.

137
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,591
You never thought of studying physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

138
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,883
I had offers, but... I chose to sell shoes.

139
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,300
Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe salesman.

140
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,925
No, just a shoe salesman.

141
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,634
-I'd love to introduce you.
-No need.

142
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,133
I've known him for years.

143
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,177
Albert.

144
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:21,883
What was that? What did you say to him?

145
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,133
Oh, he's fine.

146
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:31,883
Mr. Strauss, there are... things in my past you ought to be aware of.

147
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,841
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

148
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,515
I have access to your security file. I've read it.

149
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,086
-You're not worried?
-No.

150
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,425
Why would I be worried, after everything you've done for your country?

151
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,550
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

152
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,425
Well, the purpose of this institute

153
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,633
is to provide a haven for independent minds.

154
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,087
That's you.

155
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:50,490
You are the man for the job.

156
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:52,592
Well, then I'll consider it.

157
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,300
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

158
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,008
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country.

159
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,883
Yes, and a great commute.

160
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,216
That's why I'm considering it.

161
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:12,405
So Dr. Oppenheimer brought your attention to his past associations

162
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,924
before you appointed him?

163
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,048
Yes.

164
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,841
And they didn't concern you?

165
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,883
Just then I was entirely consumed with what he must have said

166
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,716
to Einstein to sour him on me.

167
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,801
But later?

168
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:28,633
Well, we all know what happened later.

169
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,426
Doctor, your time in Europe,

170
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,508
you seem to meet with a wide range of other countries' physicists.

171
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,698
Yes, that's right.

172
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,925
Any Russians?

173
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,676
None that spring to mind. If you'll just allow me

174
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:43,508
to continue with my statement...
-Mr. Robb,

175
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:45,925
you'll have ample opportunity to cross-examine.

176
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,800
After Göttingen, I moved on to Leiden, in Holland, where I first met Isidor Rabi.

177
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:55,966
Excuse me.

178
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,258
A yank. Lecturing on the new physics.

179
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,420
This I have to hear.

180
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:06,133
I'm an American myself.

181
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:07,841
How surprising.

182
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,966
Let me know if you need any help with the English.

183
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:26,466
Wait, what's he saying?

184
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,132
No, thank you.

185
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,425
It's a long way to Zurich.

186
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:43,841
If you get any skinnier, we're gonna lose you between the seat cushions.

187
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,595
-I'm Rabi.
-Oppenheimer.

188
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,300
I caught your lecture on molecules.

189
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,050
Caught some of it.

190
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,258
We're a couple of New York Jews, how do you know Dutch?

191
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,466
Well, I thought I'd better learn it when I got here this semester.

192
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,758
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

193
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,349
I like to challenge myself.

194
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,675
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

195
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,341
-Shvitzer.

196
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:06,512
Show-off.

197
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,133
Dutch in six weeks, but you never learned Yiddish.

198
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:11,300
They don't speak it so much my side of the park.

199
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,342
Screw you.

200
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,008
-You homesick?
-Oh, you know it.

201
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:19,883
Ever get the feeling our kind isn't entirely welcome here?

202
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:21,592
Physicists?

203
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,216
-That's funny.
-Not in the department.

204
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:26,383
They're all Jewish, too.

205
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:29,964
Eat.

206
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,133
There's this German you have to seek out.

207
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:36,800
-Heisenberg.
-Right.

208
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,926
One might be led to the presumption that behind the quantum world

209
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,592
there still hides a real world in which causality holds,

210
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:59,008
but such speculations seem to us, to say it explicitly, fruitless.

211
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,091
Thank you. Have a great day.

212
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,841
-Wonderful.
-Thank you.

213
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:11,258
-Dr. Oppenheimer.
-Oppenheimer, yes!

214
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,355
I liked your paper on molecules.

215
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,938
Probably because you inspired it.

216
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:17,800
If I inspire anything else, let me know. We could publish together.

217
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,050
-I have to get back to America.
-Why?

218
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,300
There's no one there taking quantum mechanics seriously.

219
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,675
That's exactly why.

220
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:27,425
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.

221
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:29,466
Canyons of New Mexico.

222
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,790
-You're from New Mexico?
-No, New York.

223
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:34,341
But my brother and I have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

224
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,938
That's the America I miss right now.

225
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,591
Then it's best you get home, cowboys.

226
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:41,654
That's him.

227
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,258
No, me and horses?

228
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,587
I don't think so.

229
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:46,883
Nice to meet you.

230
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,883
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?

231
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:53,425
Not in person, no, but...

232
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:57,050
you might say our paths crossed.

233
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,336
On returning to America,

234
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,425
I accepted positions at both Caltech and up at Berkeley.

235
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:29,425
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

236
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:32,883
You must be Oppenheimer.

237
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,102
Yes.

238
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,383
I hear you want to start a school of quantum theory.

239
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:38,425
I am starting it, next door.

240
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,591
-They put you in there?
-I asked for it.

241
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,758
Wanted to be close to you experimentalists.

242
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,591
Theory will get you only so far.

243
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:46,758
We're building a machine to accelerate electrons.

244
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,024
Magnificent.

245
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,091
Would you like to help?

246
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,166
Build it? Oh, no. No, no.

247
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,800
But I am working on theories I'd like to test with it.

248
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,118
When do you start teaching?

249
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,800
I've got my first in an hour.

250
00:17:58,113 --> 00:17:59,800
-Seminar?
-Pupil.

251
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:02,550
One student? That's it?

252
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,676
I'm teaching something no one here has dreamt of.

253
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,925
But once people start hearing what you can do with it...

254
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,008
There's no going back.

255
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,550
-Oh, I must have missed the...
-Mr. Lomanitz?

256
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:19,008
-Yeah.
-Yes, this is it.

257
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:20,841
Please, take a seat.

258
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,758
What do you know about quantum mechanics?

259
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:30,841
I have a grasp on the basics.

260
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:31,925
Then you're doing it wrong.

261
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:35,258
Is life made up of particles or waves?

262
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:38,008
Quantum mechanics says it's both. How can it be both?

263
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,633
-It can't.
-It can't.

264
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:41,374
But it is.

265
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:44,591
It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.

266
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,551
Thank you.

267
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,925
Mr. Lomanitz. You're gonna be okay.

268
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:01,239
Mr. Snyder.

269
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,508
Now, let's consider a star.

270
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:07,259
A star, a vast furnace burning in outer space,

271
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,716
fire pushing outwards against its own gravity, balanced.

272
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,216
But if that furnace cools,

273
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:17,383
and gravity starts winning, it contracts.

274
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,175
-Density increases.
-Correct.

275
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:23,050
-Increasing gravity.
-Increasing density.

276
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,133
-And?
-It's a vicious cycle until...

277
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:26,717
What's the limit here?

278
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:30,467
I don't know. See where the math takes us.

279
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,545
I guarantee it's somewhere no one's been before us.

280
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:33,591
Me?

281
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,175
Yes, you. Your math is better than mine.

282
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:41,258
Dr. Oppenheimer's file contained details

283
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,676
of his activities at Berkeley.

284
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:46,300
Why would they have started a file on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

285
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,383
Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hoover.

286
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,466
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

287
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,300
Uh, my assumption

288
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,341
is that it was connected to his, uh,

289
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:59,800
left-wing political activities.

290
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,883
You shouldn't let them bring their politics in the classroom, Oppie.

291
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,217
I wrote that.

292
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,212
Lawrence, you embraced the revolution in physics.

293
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,675
Can't you see it everywhere else?

294
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,592
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.

295
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,091
Well, this is America, Oppie. We had our revolution.

296
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:20,008
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.

297
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,175
Well, out of the lab

298
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:25,008
my landlady is having a discussion group tonight.

299
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,217
Interested?

300
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,176
I have sampled the Berkeley political scene.

301
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:32,508
It's all just philosophy post-grads and communists talking integration.

302
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,925
You don't care about integration?

303
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,119
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

304
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:38,216
Especially on a Friday. Come on, let's eat.

305
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,091
I'm meeting my brother there.

306
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:44,425
And how would these activities have come to the attention of the FBI?

307
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,591
Well, if I remember correctly,

308
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:50,842
the FBI was taking license plates outside suspected communist gatherings,

309
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,299
and his name popped up.

310
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:02,591
-Jesus Christ!
-Sorry.

311
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:03,675
Frank!

312
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,550
-Uh, you remember Jackie?
-Evening.

313
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,425
Robert! I want you to meet Chevalier.

314
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,714
Dr. Haakon Chevalier, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

315
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:21,425
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure.

316
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:23,258
This is my little brother, Frank.

317
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:25,378
-And this is...
-Still Jackie.

318
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:26,550
Hello, Still Jackie.

319
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:30,483
-Chevalier, you're in languages?
-And your reputation precedes you.

320
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,551
What have you heard?

321
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,828
That you're teaching a radical new approach to physics

322
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:37,091
I have no chance of understanding, but I haven't heard you're a party member.

323
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,871
-Uh, I'm not.
-Oh, not yet.

324
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,384
Frank and I are thinking of joining.

325
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,591
-Just the other day I was saying...
-I support a range of causes.

326
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:43,816
Spanish Civil War?

327
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,008
A democratic republic being overthrown by fascist thugs.

328
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,341
-Who wouldn't?
-Our government.

329
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,160
They think that socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.

330
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:53,800
Not for long. Look at what the Nazis are doing to the Jews.

331
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:56,466
I send funds to colleagues in Germany to emigrate.

332
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:57,841
I have to do something.

333
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,008
My own work is so... abstract.

334
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,050
What are you working on?

335
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:05,383
What happens to stars when they die?

336
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,841
Do stars die?

337
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:11,593
Well, if they do, they'd cool, then collapse.

338
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:14,154
In fact, the bigger the star,

339
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,216
the more violent its demise.

340
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:20,050
Their gravity gets so concentrated, it swallows everything.

341
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:21,925
Everything, even light.

342
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,425
-Can that really happen?
-The math says it can.

343
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:28,591
If we can get published, then perhaps one day an astronomer finds one.

344
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,384
But right now, all I have is theory,

345
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:32,466
which can't impact people's lives.

346
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,675
Well, if you're going to send money to Spain,

347
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:36,091
do it through the Communist Party.

348
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:37,550
They can get it to the front lines.

349
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:38,758
Mary sent me with these.

350
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,091
-I'm Jean.
-Robert.

351
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:46,133
Haakon Chevalier. That union meeting at Serber's last month.

352
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:47,800
Right, right, yes.

353
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:49,258
Oh, thank you.

354
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:51,591
Robert here says he's not a communist.

355
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,883
Well, then he doesn't know enough about it.

356
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:56,675
Oh, I've read Das Kapital, all three volumes.

357
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,759
Does that count?

358
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,883
It would make you better-read than most party members.

359
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:02,239
Turgid stuff. There's some thinking, um...

360
00:23:02,283 --> 00:23:03,591
"Ownership is theft."

361
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,300
-Property.
-Property?

362
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,091
Property, not ownership.

363
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:09,341
I'm sorry, I read it in the original German.

364
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,466
It's not about the book. It's about the ideas.

365
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,216
And you sound uncommitted.

366
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:20,633
I'm committed to thinking freely about how to improve our world.

367
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,633
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

368
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:25,883
You're a physicist. Do you pick and choose rules?

369
00:23:26,716 --> 00:23:30,425
Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress?

370
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,341
I like a little wiggle room.

371
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,341
Do you always toe the party line?

372
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:38,966
I like my wiggle room, too.

373
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,010
What?

374
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:53,010
Wait, wait, wait.

375
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,091
Unexpected.

376
00:23:58,769 --> 00:23:59,758
What?

377
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,087
For a physicist.

378
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,466
You only have a shelf full of Freud?

379
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:07,091
-Well, actually, my background's more...
-Jungian?

380
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,591
You know analysis?

381
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:14,050
When I was in post-grad at Cambridge, I had a little trouble.

382
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,870
-I'll bite.
-I tried to poison my tutor.

383
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,175
-Did you hate him?
-I liked him very much.

384
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,091
You just needed to get laid.

385
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,884
It took my analysts two years,

386
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:26,133
and I don't think they ever put it that succinctly.

387
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:29,841
You have everyone convinced you're more complicated than you actually are.

388
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:32,216
We're all simple souls, I guess.

389
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:33,468
I'm not.

390
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,177
What's this?

391
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:38,307
Sanskrit.

392
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:39,633
You can read this?

393
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:41,382
I'm learning.

394
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:47,966
Read this.

395
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:50,550
Well, in this part,

396
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:53,966
-Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self...
-No.

397
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:56,675
Read the words.

398
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,675
"And now I am become Death...

399
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,591
"destroyer of worlds."

400
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:42,383
This'll do.

401
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,300
It'll break before dawn.

402
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,175
Air cools overnight.

403
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,175
Just before dawn, it breaks.

404
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,091
Well, so, I'm getting married.

405
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,008
-Frank! congratulations!
-Thank you, thank you.

406
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,133
-To Jackie?
-Yeah, to Jackie.

407
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,550
-The waitress?
-Oppie, you're right. It's letting up.

408
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:18,925
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.

409
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,675
All your talk about the common man, but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

410
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,910
We joined the party, and you can't hide your disappointment.

411
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,905
Why? Is that because that's supposed to be your thing?

412
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,341
I haven't joined the party, Frank.

413
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:32,966
And I don't think she should have convinced you to either.

414
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,800
-Half of the faculty is communist.
-Not that half.

415
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,274
I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be cautious.

416
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:41,550
And I want to wring your neck.

417
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:46,966
I won't live my life afraid to make a mistake.

418
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:52,091
You're happy... I'm happy.

419
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:54,841
So then I'm happy you're happy that I'm happy.

420
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,633
I feel like I can see one of those dark stars that you're working on.

421
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:04,466
You can't.

422
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:07,895
That's the whole point. Their gravity swallows light.

423
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:11,633
It's like a kind of hole in space.

424
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:13,675
Is Frank okay?

425
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,216
Yes. He just has a shitty brother.

426
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:18,800
It is special here.

427
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,550
When I was a kid...

428
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:25,591
I thought if I could find a way...

429
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,675
to combine physics and New Mexico,

430
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:32,800
my life would be perfect.

431
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,925
-Little remote for that.
-Yes.

432
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:38,841
Let's get some sleep.

433
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:43,883
That mesa we saw today, one of my favorite places in the world.

434
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:47,216
-Tomorrow we'll climb it.
-What's it called?

435
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:50,008
Los Alamos.

436
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:55,800
I didn't expect to see you today.

437
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:58,758
Do I have to make an appointment?

438
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:04,107
Alvarez?

439
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:12,133
Oppie! Oppie!

440
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:14,341
What? What is it?

441
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:15,966
They've done it.

442
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:17,883
They've done it. Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

443
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:19,175
They split the uranium nucleus.

444
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,300
How?

445
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:25,091
Bombard it with neutrons.

446
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:26,758
It's a nuclear fission.

447
00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:28,466
They did it. They split the atom.

448
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:29,508
That's not possible.

449
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,258
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

450
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,175
See? Can't be done.

451
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:48,550
Very elegant.

452
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:50,633
Quite clear.

453
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:51,966
There's just one problem.

454
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,133
Where?

455
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:54,758
Next door.

456
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:56,424
Alvarez did it.

457
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,797
And look.

458
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:02,081
These fission pulses, they're massive.

459
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:05,716
I've seen 30 of these in the past ten minutes.

460
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:08,633
Theory will take you only so far.

461
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:11,716
During the process...

462
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,550
extra neutrons boil off, which could be used

463
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:17,550
to split other uranium atoms.

464
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,841
Chain reaction.

465
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:20,746
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

466
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:24,883
You, me, and every other physicist around the world who's seen the news.

467
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:27,466
I just... what, what are we all thinking?

468
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:31,008
A bomb, Alvarez.

469
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:33,423
A bomb.

470
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:37,175
I told you, Robert, no more fucking flowers.

471
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:42,175
-I don't understand what you want from me.
-I don't want anything from you!

472
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:47,216
-Well, you say that, and then you call.
-Well, don't answer.

473
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:49,675
I'll always answer.

474
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:56,258
Fine.

475
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:58,008
Just no more flowers.

476
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:00,880
You're not coming?

477
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:05,050
You have to know when you're beaten, Robert.

478
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,008
It's not that simple, Haak.

479
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,841
Chevalier, good to see you. Barbara, good to see you.

480
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:15,050
And the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

481
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:17,050
-I'm Eltenton.
-Oh, pleasure.

482
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:18,091
Please, please.

483
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:21,133
Why don't you say a word about organized labor on campuses?

484
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:23,758
Yes? Coming through, coming through!

485
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
I work at Shell.

486
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:27,050
We've signed up chemists, we've signed up engineers.

487
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,008
So why not sciences and academia?

488
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:33,050
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

489
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,883
Teachers are unionized.

490
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,675
Why not professors?

491
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,175
Don't you have somewhere to be?

492
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,591
Lawrence, academics have rights too.

493
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,925
Look, it's not that. I've got a group coming.

494
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:55,675
-Oh. I'll sit in.
-Not this one.

495
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:04,216
Richard, Dr. Bush.

496
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:05,591
What brings you two up north?

497
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:18,175
Richard, you tell Ruth I'll be down in Pasadena Thursday.

498
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,341
Paper on black holes, it's in!

499
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,257
Where's Hartland?

500
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:35,883
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

501
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:39,425
September 1st, 1939? The world's gonna remember this day.

502
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,050
Oh, Hartland, our paper, it's in print.

503
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:44,425
You've been upstaged.

504
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:51,216
During the Battle of Britain, I found myself

505
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,966
increasingly out of sympathy with the...

506
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:57,425
policy of neutrality that communists advocated.

507
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:59,966
But after Hitler invaded Russia and we became allies,

508
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:02,800
these communist sympathies, do they return?

509
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:04,177
No.

510
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,050
I need to make clear that my changing views on Russia

511
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:12,091
did not mean a sharp break from those who held different views.

512
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:14,966
For a year or two during a previous marriage,

513
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,925
my wife Kitty had been a Communist Party member.

514
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:24,383
This is where I keep the good stuff.

515
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,216
Well, I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

516
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:28,341
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.

517
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:29,758
Do you two need anything?

518
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:31,050
We're good, Ruthie.

519
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:35,175
So, you're a biologist.

520
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:38,758
Well, somehow I have graduated to housewife.

521
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,216
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?

522
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:44,216
-Seems baffling.
-Yes, it is.

523
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,050
Well, this glass,

524
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,216
this drink... this countertop...

525
00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:53,758
Our bodies.

526
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:56,675
All of it.

527
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,300
It's mostly empty space.

528
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,008
Groupings of tiny energy waves bound together.

529
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:04,175
By what?

530
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:07,383
Forces of attraction strong enough to convince us

531
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,091
that matter is solid.

532
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:12,508
Stop my body passing through yours.

533
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,883
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

534
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:28,425
Not very.

535
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,883
There is someone that I feel...

536
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,425
Does she feel that way?

537
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:37,175
Sometimes.

538
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:39,007
Not enough.

539
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:43,008
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.

540
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:45,425
To my ranch, with friends.

541
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:46,675
You should come.

542
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:49,216
I meant, with your husband.

543
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:50,633
Yes, you did.

544
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:53,091
Because you know it won't make a bit of difference.

545
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:59,050
Why did you marry him?

546
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,841
I was lost, and... he was kind.

547
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,300
Lost?

548
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,883
Well, my previous husband had died, and...

549
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,508
at 28, I wasn't really ready to be a widow.

550
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,091
-Who was your first husband?
-Nobody.

551
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,508
My second husband was Joe Dallet.

552
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,975
He was from money, like me,

553
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:22,425
but he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio.

554
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:23,591
I fell hard.

555
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:26,758
-How hard?
-Hard enough to spend the next four years

556
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,050
living off beans and pancakes,

557
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:30,341
handing out the Daily Worker at factory gates.

558
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,966
By '36, I just told Joe I couldn't take it anymore.

559
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:35,050
Quit the party.

560
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:36,591
A year later, I wanted him back.

561
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:38,800
Him, not the Daily Worker. And...

562
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,341
he said: "Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain."

563
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:42,633
Went to fight for the Loyalists?

564
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,466
And then he went to the brigades and I waited.

565
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:45,758
And...

566
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:50,258
Joe got himself killed first time he popped his head out of the trench.

567
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:54,300
Ideology got Joe killed, for nothing.

568
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:56,133
The Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

569
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:59,175
My husband offered both our futures to stop one fascist bullet

570
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:01,216
from embedding itself in a mud bank.

571
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,383
That's the definition of nothing.

572
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,675
-Seems a little reductive.
-Pragmatic.

573
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:09,716
Now here I am.

574
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,883
Wherever the hell this is.

575
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,841
I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.

576
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:28,633
At least you didn't bring me flowers.

577
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:38,716
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.

578
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:41,966
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

579
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:43,758
No.

580
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:47,425
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

581
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,508
You knocked her up. Fast work.

582
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:53,175
Can't keep a good man down.

583
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:55,508
I meant her.

584
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,550
She knew what she wanted.

585
00:35:58,213 --> 00:35:59,383
What about the husband?

586
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:01,008
We talked.

587
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:02,675
They're getting a divorce,

588
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:06,466
so we can get married before she starts showing.

589
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:08,091
How civilized.

590
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,341
You idiot.

591
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,050
This is your community.

592
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,216
You think the rules don't apply to the golden boy?

593
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,008
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

594
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:23,091
Don't alienate the only people in the world that understand what you do.

595
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,383
One day you might need them.

596
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:28,966
F-A-E-C-T!

597
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:33,258
Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians.

598
00:36:38,058 --> 00:36:40,100
辐射实验室工会

599
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:42,258
Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?

600
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,758
That's not the point, Lawrence.

601
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:48,341
What do any of you have in common with farm laborers and dock workers?

602
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:49,761
Plenty.

603
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,384
Everybody out. Now!

604
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,051
Not you.

605
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:06,344
What are you doing?

606
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,134
It's a trade union.

607
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:11,914
-Filled with communists.
-So? I haven't joined the party.

608
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,940
They won't let me bring you onto the project because of this shit.

609
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,440
They won't even let me tell you what the project is.

610
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,607
Oh, I know what the project is.

611
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:20,732
Oh, really?

612
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:23,556
We've all heard about Einstein and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

613
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,024
warning him the Germans could make a bomb,

614
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:28,274
and I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb.

615
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:29,482
And I don't?

616
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:32,107
It's not your people they're herding into camps.

617
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:33,941
It's mine.

618
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:37,315
You think that I tell them about your politics?

619
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,232
The next time you're coming home from a meeting,

620
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:43,232
why don't you take a look in the rearview mirror,

621
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:48,232
listen to the sounds on your phone line, and stop being so goddamn naive?

622
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:51,065
Why would they care what I do?

623
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:54,982
Because you're not just self-important, you're actually important.

624
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,691
Okay.

625
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,190
I get it.

626
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,973
If you could just be a little more...

627
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:06,955
Pragmatic. I'll talk to Lomanitz, I'll talk to the others.

628
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,315
You don't have to worry, it's done.

629
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:10,108
Lawrence.

630
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:16,357
Then welcome to the war.

631
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:20,732
I filled out my first security questionnaire and was informed

632
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:23,429
that my involvement with left-wing groups would

633
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:26,940
not prove a bar to my working on the atomic program.

634
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,690
Why were his communist associations

635
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:32,649
not seen as a security risk during the war?

636
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,443
Senator, I can't possibly answer

637
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:37,771
for security clearance granted years before I ever met the man.

638
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,024
Fine. What about after?

639
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:42,296
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer was

640
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,482
the most respected scientific voice in the world.

641
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,822
That's why I asked him to run the Institute.

642
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:50,690
That's why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission.

643
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Simple as that.

644
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,815
What are they accusing me of?

645
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,000
I think they just want to know what happened between 1947 and 1954

646
00:38:58,024 --> 00:39:00,565
to change your mind on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

647
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:01,815
I didn't.

648
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,732
I was chair of the AEC, but it wasn't me

649
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:07,999
that brought the charges against Robert.
-Who did?

650
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:10,565
Some former staff member of the Joint Congressional Committee.

651
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,065
He was a rabid anti-communist named Borden.

652
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:15,929
He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action.

653
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:18,524
The FBI? Why not go to the AEC direct?

654
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,774
You'd get caught holding the knife yourself.

655
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:23,065
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?

656
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:24,524
This is the McCarthy era.

657
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:29,524
People hounded out of jobs for any hint of red, and...

658
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:33,565
Reading Oppenheimer's security file, his communist brother,

659
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:36,357
sister-in-law, fiancée, best friend, wife.

660
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:39,096
That's before we even get to the Chevalier incident.

661
00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:42,065
But how would Borden have access to Oppenheimer's security file?

662
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,940
Because somebody gave it to him.

663
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,732
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.

664
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,982
Who?
-Who knows?

665
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:53,940
Robert didn't take care not to upset the power brokers in Washington.

666
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:57,232
His opinions on the atom became definitive,

667
00:39:57,649 --> 00:40:00,107
and he wasn't always patient with us mere mortals.

668
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:06,232
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

669
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:09,190
There was an AEC vote

670
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,024
on the export of isotopes to Norway,

671
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:14,815
and they drafted in Robert to make me look like a fool.

672
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:18,067
But Dr. Oppenheimer, we've already heard from Admiral Strauss

673
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:21,190
that these isotopes could be useful to our enemies

674
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:22,690
in the production of atomic weapons.

675
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:26,065
Congressman, you could use a shovel in making atomic weapons.

676
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,126
In fact, you do.

677
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,167
You could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons.

678
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,857
In fact, you do. I'd say isotopes are

679
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:34,982
less useful than electronic components,

680
00:40:35,024 --> 00:40:36,649
but more useful than a sandwich.

681
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,399
Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.

682
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,024
How could this man who saw so much be so blind?

683
00:40:55,857 --> 00:40:56,857
Kitty?

684
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:02,982
Kitty?

685
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:05,524
Kitty.

686
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:06,899
The project.

687
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:08,857
I'm in.

688
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,065
-I'm in!
-Let's celebrate.

689
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,399
Shouldn't you go to him?

690
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,565
I have been going to him all fucking day.

691
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,024
I don't know how to say this.

692
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:57,690
I'm a shamed to ask.

693
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Anything.

694
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,065
-Take Peter.
-Sure.

695
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:04,232
No, for a while, Haak.

696
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:05,981
A while.

697
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:11,274
-Does Kitty know you're here?
-Yes, of course she knows.

698
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,524
Of course she knows.

699
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:16,967
We're awful people. Selfish, awful people.

700
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:20,566
Forget I asked.

701
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,626
Selfish, awful people,

702
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,232
they don't know they're selfish and awful.

703
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:27,065
Sit, sit, sit.

704
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:32,565
Robert, you see beyond the world we live in.

705
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:36,274
There is a price to be paid for that.

706
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,107
Of course we'll help you.

707
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:51,232
Everything's changing, Robert.

708
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,649
Having a child was always going to change...

709
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,190
No, the world is pivoting in some new direction.

710
00:42:58,357 --> 00:42:59,440
Reforming.

711
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,065
This is your moment.

712
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:08,024
-We're putting together a group to study...
-We shouldn't be doing anything.

713
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:09,356
You should.

714
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:11,815
Lawrence won't get this done.

715
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,232
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

716
00:43:23,774 --> 00:43:24,899
Who are the uniforms?

717
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:27,274
I thought you might know.

718
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:30,898
Dr. Oppenheimer.

719
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:35,649
I'm Colonel Groves. This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

720
00:43:35,899 --> 00:43:36,897
Have that dry cleaned.

721
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:45,232
Well, if that's how you treat a lieutenant colonel,

722
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:48,649
I'd hate to see how you treat a... humble physicist.

723
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,565
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

724
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:54,149
-Ouch.
-Theaters of combat all over the world,

725
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,774
but I have to stay in Washington.

726
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:58,684
-Why?
-I built the Pentagon.

727
00:43:58,728 --> 00:43:59,940
The brass likes it so much,

728
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:03,149
they made me take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

729
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:06,690
-Which is?
-Don't be a smartass.

730
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,050
You know damn well what it is.

731
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:10,611
You and half of every physics department across the country.

732
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:11,899
That's problem number one.

733
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,649
I thought problem number one would be securing enough uranium ore.

734
00:44:15,982 --> 00:44:19,274
-1,200 tons, bought the day I took charge.
-Processing?

735
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:21,524
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

736
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:24,524
Now I'm looking for a project director.

737
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,524
And my name came up?

738
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:28,024
Nope.

739
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:32,357
Even though you brought quantum physics to America, which made me curious.

740
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:34,149
What have you found out?

741
00:44:35,518 --> 00:44:39,274
You're a dilettante, a womanizer, a suspected communist.

742
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:41,940
-I'm a New Deal Democrat.
-I said "suspected".

743
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,547
Unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic.

744
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,608
Nothing good, no?

745
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,558
Not even "he's brilliant, but..."

746
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:52,190
Well, brilliance is taken for granted in your circle, so no.

747
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,815
No, the only person who had anything good to say was Richard Tolman.

748
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,399
Tolman thinks you have integrity,

749
00:44:58,649 --> 00:45:03,065
but he also strikes me as a guy who knows more about science than people.

750
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:04,566
Yet here you are.

751
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:07,065
You don't take much on trust.

752
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,732
I don't take anything on trust.

753
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,232
Why don't you have a Nobel Prize?

754
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,740
-Why aren't you a general?
-They're making me one for this.

755
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:18,220
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

756
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:19,759
The Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

757
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,649
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

758
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:25,774
So how would you proceed?

759
00:45:27,877 --> 00:45:32,359
You're talking about turning theory into a practical weapon system

760
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:35,649
faster than the Nazis.
-Who have a 12-month head start.

761
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:37,815
-18
-18.
-How could you possibly know that?

762
00:45:38,107 --> 00:45:40,302
Our fast neutron research took six months.

763
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:43,304
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge will have made that leap instantly.

764
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:45,488
-Who do you think they put in charge?
-Werner Heisenberg.

765
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,815
He has the most intuitive understanding of atomic structure I have ever seen.

766
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:51,524
-You know his work?
-I know him,

767
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,152
just like I know Walther Bothe, von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

768
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:55,732
In a straight race, the Germans win.

769
00:45:56,578 --> 00:45:58,232
-We've got one hope.
-Which is?

770
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,691
Antisemitism.

771
00:46:02,774 --> 00:46:03,732
What?

772
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,399
Hitler called quantum physics "Jewish science".

773
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,774
Said it right to Einstein's face.

774
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:11,315
Our one hope is that Hitler is so blinded by hate

775
00:46:11,357 --> 00:46:13,399
that he's denied Heisenberg proper resources,

776
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,190
because it'll take vast resources.

777
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:18,024
Our nation's best scientists working together. Right now, they're scattered.

778
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:19,774
Which gives us compartmentalization.

779
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:23,040
All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently.

780
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:25,315
Poor security may cost us the race.

781
00:46:25,357 --> 00:46:26,524
Inefficiency will.

782
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:28,899
The Germans know more than us anyway.

783
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,524
The Russians don't.

784
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:35,107
Remind me, who are we at war with?

785
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,524
Somebody with your past doesn't want to be seen downplaying

786
00:46:38,565 --> 00:46:41,899
the importance of security from our communist allies.

787
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:45,107
Point taken, but... no.

788
00:46:45,528 --> 00:46:46,857
You don't get to say no to me.

789
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:49,107
It's my job to say no to you when you're wrong.

790
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,399
So you have the job now?

791
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:52,982
Uh, I'm considering it.

792
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,315
I'm starting to see where you got your reputation.

793
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:01,190
My favorite response:

794
00:47:02,315 --> 00:47:04,440
"Oppenheimer couldn't run a hamburger stand."

795
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:07,399
I couldn't.

796
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:11,399
But I can run the Manhattan Project.

797
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,524
There's a way to balance these things.

798
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:18,565
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley, under Lawrence.

799
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:21,065
Met Lab in Chicago, under Szilard.

800
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:23,232
Large-scale refining, where did you say, Tennessee?

801
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:25,024
-And Hanford.
-And Hanford.

802
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:28,774
All America's industrial-minded scientific innovation,

803
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:32,274
connected by rail, focused on one goal,

804
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:33,982
one point in space and time.

805
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:36,838
And it comes together here, a secret laboratory.

806
00:47:36,882 --> 00:47:39,179
In the middle of nowhere, secure, self-sufficient.

807
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,649
Equipment, housing, the works.

808
00:47:40,764 --> 00:47:42,065
Keep everyone there until it's done.

809
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:45,774
-We'll need a school, stores, a church.
-Why?

810
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:48,857
If we don't let scientists bring their families, we'll never get the best.

811
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:51,732
You want security, build a town. Build it fast.

812
00:47:52,076 --> 00:47:53,065
Where?

813
00:47:57,065 --> 00:47:58,399
Welcome to Los Alamos.

814
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,190
There's a boys' school we'll have to commandeer,

815
00:48:01,232 --> 00:48:03,190
and the local Indians come up here for burial rites,

816
00:48:03,232 --> 00:48:04,997
but apart from that, nothing.

817
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:06,524
40 miles. Any direction.

818
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:08,107
We'll have to find the perfect spot.

819
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:10,649
-For?
-Success.

820
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,232
Build him a town. Fast.

821
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:21,565
Let's go recruit some scientists.

822
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:23,982
Why would I leave my family?

823
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:25,774
I told you, you can bring your family.

824
00:48:25,857 --> 00:48:27,982
-I'm not a soldier, Oppie.
-A soldier?

825
00:48:28,565 --> 00:48:30,857
He's a general. I've got all the soldier I need.

826
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:32,523
What can I tell them?

827
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:36,524
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe and Bohr. What do these men have in common?

828
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,399
-Uh, the greatest minds on atomic theory.
-Yes, and?

829
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:41,566
As much as you like.

830
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:44,774
Until you feel my boot on your balls.

831
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,607
You know isotopes, and you know explosives better than anyone in the world.

832
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:51,190
But you can't tell us what you're doing.

833
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,940
-I don't know.
-The Nazis have them.

834
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:58,622
Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.

835
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:01,649
Under Nazi occupation. Did they stop printing newspapers in Princeton?

836
00:49:01,907 --> 00:49:05,482
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere for who knows how long?

837
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:07,190
For a year or two. Or three.

838
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:11,732
General, could you... give us a moment?

839
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:15,524
It's about unleashing a strong force.

840
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:18,565
Before the Nazis do.

841
00:49:19,482 --> 00:49:20,482
Oh my god.

842
00:49:20,982 --> 00:49:22,940
-Niels won't work for the Nazis.
-No, never.

843
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:24,940
But while they have him, we don't.

844
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,482
That's why I need you.

845
00:49:26,857 --> 00:49:28,440
Why would you think I'd do that?

846
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,107
Why? Why?

847
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:32,940
How about because this is the most important fucking thing

848
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:34,857
to ever happen in the history of the world?

849
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:36,067
How about that?

850
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:37,983
Fuck.

851
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:44,774
They're not gonna let me onto this project.

852
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,982
And failing a security check

853
00:49:47,024 --> 00:49:49,440
is not going to be good for a career even after the war.

854
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:51,899
So you're a fellow traveler. So what?

855
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:53,925
This is a national emergency.

856
00:49:53,982 --> 00:49:56,399
I've got some skeletons. They put me in charge.

857
00:49:56,982 --> 00:49:57,981
They need us.

858
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Until they don't.

859
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:05,857
Is there any chance of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

860
00:50:05,978 --> 00:50:08,690
Yeah, no dice. I checked with the British.

861
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:12,315
Until we get Allied boots back onto the continent, there's just no way.

862
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:15,524
Is he that important?

863
00:50:15,565 --> 00:50:18,482
How many people do you know who proved Einstein wrong?

864
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:22,107
You know, it really would be quicker to take a plane.

865
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,232
A plane's too risky.

866
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:24,815
The country needs us.

867
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:29,482
What happened, guys?

868
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,690
They say the building's too small for this cyclotron.

869
00:50:34,524 --> 00:50:35,940
Get them together with the architects.

870
00:50:39,694 --> 00:50:41,107
When's this place supposed to open?

871
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:45,442
Two months.

872
00:50:46,732 --> 00:50:49,899
Robert, you're the great improviser, but this...

873
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:52,315
you can't do in your head.

874
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:54,815
Four divisions.

875
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,774
Experimental, theoretical, metallurgical.

876
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:01,149
Who's running theoretical?

877
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,191
I am.

878
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:04,982
That's what I was afraid of. You're spread too thin.

879
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:07,774
So you take theoretical.

880
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,441
I'm not coming here, Robert.

881
00:51:19,732 --> 00:51:20,734
Why not?

882
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:30,940
You drop a bomb and it falls on the just and the unjust.

883
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:35,190
I don't wish the culmination of three centuries of physics

884
00:51:35,232 --> 00:51:36,857
to be a weapon of mass destruction.

885
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:47,983
Izzy...

886
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,065
I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon.

887
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:57,690
But I know the Nazis can't.

888
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:02,940
We have no choice.

889
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:06,900
Then...

890
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:09,982
The second thing you have to do

891
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:13,107
is appoint Hans Bethe to run the theoretical division.

892
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,357
Wait, what was the first?

893
00:52:17,649 --> 00:52:19,565
Take off that ridiculous uniform.

894
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:21,149
You're a scientist.

895
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,899
Groves is insisting we join.

896
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:24,940
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

897
00:52:25,523 --> 00:52:26,857
They need us for who we are.

898
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,191
So be yourself.

899
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,192
Only better.

900
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:11,399
This is the only key.

901
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,899
And Teller's already here.

902
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,595
-Shall I just show him in?
-No, let's wait for the others.

903
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:25,816
Let's get started.

904
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:28,940
-Hello, Edward.
-Yes.

905
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:31,422
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

906
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:34,524
until the T Section at Los Alamos is finished.

907
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:36,315
-Edward, can I...?
-This is more important.

908
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:42,649
When I calculated the chain reaction, I found a rather troubling possibility.

909
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,524
No, this can't be right.

910
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,899
Show me how you did your calculations.

911
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,192
Yes.

912
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:56,982
-Exponential.
-No, no, no. No.

913
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,482
This is fantasy.

914
00:54:02,232 --> 00:54:03,690
Teller's calculations can't be right.

915
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,565
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.

916
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:08,985
-What for?
-To talk to Einstein.

917
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:11,149
Well, there's not much common ground between the two.

918
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:12,732
That's why I should get his view.

919
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,357
-Albert.
-Hmm?

920
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,107
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer.

921
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:24,024
Have you met Dr. Gödel?

922
00:54:24,398 --> 00:54:25,982
We walk here most days.

923
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:29,982
Trees have the most inspiring structures.

924
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,440
Albert, might I have a word?

925
00:54:32,982 --> 00:54:34,732
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

926
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,315
Some days Kurt refuses to eat.

927
00:54:39,732 --> 00:54:44,107
Even in Princeton, he's convinced that the Nazis can poison his food.

928
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,107
Whose, whose work is this?

929
00:54:58,524 --> 00:54:59,525
Teller's.

930
00:55:00,803 --> 00:55:02,440
What do you take it to mean?

931
00:55:03,304 --> 00:55:05,107
Neutrons smash into the nucleus,

932
00:55:05,149 --> 00:55:08,399
releasing neutrons to smash into other nuclei.

933
00:55:09,315 --> 00:55:10,317
Criticality.

934
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:12,857
Point of no return. Massive explosive force.

935
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:15,524
But this time, the chain reaction doesn't stop.

936
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:18,565
It would ignite the atmosphere.

937
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,649
When we detonate an atomic device, we might start a chain reaction that...

938
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:26,942
destroys the world.

939
00:55:28,315 --> 00:55:29,607
So here we are, hmm?

940
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:33,940
Lost in your quantum world of probabilities,

941
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,940
and needing certainty.

942
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,690
Can you run the calculations yourself?

943
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:42,065
About the only thing you and I have in common

944
00:55:42,107 --> 00:55:44,149
is a disdain for mathematics.

945
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:46,440
Who's working on this in Berkeley?

946
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:47,524
Hans Bethe.

947
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,399
Well, he'll get to the truth.

948
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,274
And if the truth is catastrophic?

949
00:55:54,232 --> 00:55:58,399
Then you stop, and you share your findings with the Nazis.

950
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:01,607
So neither side destroys the world.

951
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:06,572
Robert.

952
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,107
This is yours, not mine.

953
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,190
Teller's wrong.

954
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:26,900
He's wrong.

955
00:56:36,729 --> 00:56:40,565
When you know Teller's critical assumptions, the real picture emerges.

956
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,690
Bottom line?

957
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,399
The chances of an out-of-control nuclear reaction are near-zero.

958
00:56:45,632 --> 00:56:46,732
Near-zero.

959
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:49,732
Oppie, this is good news.

960
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:50,818
Mm-hmm.

961
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:52,983
Can you run them again?

962
00:56:53,063 --> 00:56:54,399
Oh, you'll get the same answer.

963
00:56:54,964 --> 00:56:56,607
Until they actually detonate one of these things,

964
00:56:56,649 --> 00:56:58,357
the best assurance you're going to get is this.

965
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,190
Near-zero.

966
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:05,482
Theory will take you only so far.

967
00:57:06,232 --> 00:57:08,024
-Hello!
-Hi.

968
00:57:08,188 --> 00:57:09,191
We missed him.

969
00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:10,567
You want to adopt?

970
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:11,775
She's kidding.

971
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,607
We wanted to see you before we left.

972
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,565
For parts unknown.

973
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:19,440
You know who I ran into the other day?

974
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:21,025
Eltenton.

975
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,190
That chemist from Shell? The union guy?

976
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:27,899
Yeah, the FAECT guy.

977
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,357
He was moaning about how we're handling the war.

978
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:33,525
How so?

979
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,440
Lack of cooperation with our allies.

980
00:57:37,065 --> 00:57:40,982
Apparently, our government's not sharing any research with the Russians.

981
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,190
He said most scientists think the policy is stupid.

982
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,274
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

983
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,815
He mentioned that if anyone had anything they wanted to pass on,

984
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,274
going around official channels, that he could help.

985
00:58:08,107 --> 00:58:09,274
That would be treason.

986
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:11,690
Yes, of course.

987
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:14,024
I just thought you should know.

988
00:58:17,018 --> 00:58:18,607
The brat is down.

989
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:20,192
Where are the martinis?

990
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:26,650
Coming right up.

991
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,899
The conversation ended there.

992
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:32,190
Nothing in our long-standing friendship would have led me to believe

993
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:35,149
that Chevalier was actually seeking information,

994
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:39,524
and I am certain that he had no idea of the work in which I was engaged.

995
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,940
It has long been clear to me that I should have reported this incident at once.

996
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:52,025
The Oppenheimer situation highlights the tension

997
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:55,275
between scientists and the security apparatus.

998
00:58:55,568 --> 00:58:57,942
In hopes of learning how the nominee handled such issues

999
00:58:57,984 --> 00:58:59,734
during his time at the AEC,

1000
00:59:00,092 --> 00:59:02,692
we'll have a scientist appearing before the committee.

1001
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:05,067
Who are they bringing in?

1002
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:06,318
They hadn't said.

1003
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:10,442
Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'm nominated for Commerce Secretary.

1004
00:59:10,558 --> 00:59:12,775
Why seek the opinion of scientists?

1005
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,984
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

1006
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:17,859
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1007
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,150
I'd like to know the name of the scientist testifying.

1008
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:21,775
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

1009
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:23,467
This is not a court.

1010
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:26,276
Formality, huh?

1011
00:59:26,317 --> 00:59:30,359
No presidential cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1012
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,275
This is just how the game is played.

1013
00:59:32,317 --> 00:59:34,609
It's in the bag, Lewis. So play nice.

1014
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:36,692
They bring in a scientist, so what?

1015
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,275
You don't know scientists like I do, Counselor.

1016
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:41,484
They resent anyone who questions their judgment,

1017
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:42,985
especially if you're not one of them.

1018
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:44,609
I was chair of the AEC.

1019
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:46,900
I'm easy to blame for what happened to Robert.

1020
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:48,234
We can't have the Senate thinking

1021
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:50,650
the scientific community doesn't support you, sir.

1022
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:53,025
Or should we pivot?

1023
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,025
-To what?
-And embrace it.

1024
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:58,067
"I fought Oppenheimer, and the US won."

1025
00:59:58,359 --> 00:59:59,900
I don't think we need to go there.

1026
00:59:59,942 --> 01:00:02,275
Isn't there someone we can call who knows what really happened?

1027
01:00:02,317 --> 01:00:03,900
-Teller.
-He'll make an impression.

1028
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:05,817
Can you get the name of the scientist they've called?

1029
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,317
-Probably.
-Find out if he was based in Chicago

1030
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:09,984
or Los Alamos during the war.

1031
01:00:10,192 --> 01:00:11,025
Why does that matter?

1032
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:13,775
Well, if he was based in Chicago, they worked under Szilard and Fermi,

1033
01:00:13,817 --> 01:00:15,775
not the cult to Bobby in Los Alamos.

1034
01:00:16,252 --> 01:00:19,275
Robert built that damn place. He was founder, mayor, sheriff.

1035
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:21,312
All rolled into one.

1036
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:35,734
Now all it needs is a saloon.

1037
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:06,566
There's no kitchen.

1038
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:10,150
Really? We'll fix that.

1039
01:01:17,275 --> 01:01:19,442
Barbed wire? Guns?

1040
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:22,900
-Oppie...
-We're at war, Hans.

1041
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:26,770
Halifax.

1042
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:28,317
1917.

1043
01:01:28,442 --> 01:01:31,150
A cargo ship carrying munitions explodes in the harbor.

1044
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:36,525
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

1045
01:01:40,317 --> 01:01:42,859
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

1046
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:46,525
Now, let's calculate how much more destructive it would have been

1047
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:49,562
if it were a nuclear and not a chemical reaction,

1048
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,817
expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

1049
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:54,650
But it will be thousands.

1050
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,900
Well, then, kilotons.

1051
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:04,234
Using U-235,

1052
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:06,525
the bomb will need a...
-Uh...

1053
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:10,734
Sorry. Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere

1054
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:12,192
about this size,

1055
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:15,692
or using plutonium, a ten-pound sphere.

1056
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:21,567
Here's the amount of uranium Oak Ridge refined all of last month.

1057
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:28,312
And the Hanford plant made this much plutonium.

1058
01:02:30,634 --> 01:02:34,442
Now, if we can enrich these amounts, we need a way to detonate them.

1059
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:36,775
Are we boring you, Edward?

1060
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:38,984
A little bit, yes.

1061
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:40,484
May I ask why?

1062
01:02:40,734 --> 01:02:43,984
We all entered this room knowing a fission bomb was possible.

1063
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,525
How about we leave it with something new?

1064
01:02:46,865 --> 01:02:47,860
Such as?

1065
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,692
Instead of uranium or plutonium, we use hydrogen.

1066
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:55,442
Heavy hydrogen. Deuterium.

1067
01:02:56,507 --> 01:02:58,859
You see, we compact the atoms together

1068
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,067
under great pressure to induce a fusion reaction.

1069
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:07,192
Then we'll get not kilotons, but megatons.

1070
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,567
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1071
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:13,942
So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1072
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,317
A small fission bomb.

1073
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:18,360
There we are!

1074
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:22,275
Well, since we're going to need one anyway,

1075
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:23,817
can we get back to the business at hand?

1076
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:27,275
The isotopes issue wasn't your most important

1077
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:30,400
policy disagreement with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1078
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:32,873
It was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

1079
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:37,775
As colleagues, we agreed to disagree on a great many things, uh...

1080
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:41,859
And one of them was the need for an H-bomb program, yes.

1081
01:03:55,525 --> 01:03:58,103
Thanks for convening on short notice.

1082
01:03:58,353 --> 01:03:59,395
I can't believe it.

1083
01:04:00,775 --> 01:04:04,025
But here we are. Catch me up. What do we know?

1084
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:08,234
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific has detected radiation.

1085
01:04:08,648 --> 01:04:11,192
-Do we have the filter papers?
-There's no doubt what this is.

1086
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,567
-White House says there's a doubt.
-Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1087
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:17,442
Are those the long-range detection filter papers?

1088
01:04:18,259 --> 01:04:19,567
It's an atomic test.

1089
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,484
The Russians have a bomb.

1090
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:27,650
We're supposed to be years ahead of them, but this...

1091
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:31,690
What were you guys doing in Los Alamos? Wasn't security tight?

1092
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:34,400
-Of course it was. You weren't there.
-Forgive me, Doctor.

1093
01:04:36,692 --> 01:04:37,693
But I was there.

1094
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:42,234
We can now consider the actual mechanics of detonation.

1095
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:45,150
-Any ideas?
-I call this shooting.

1096
01:04:45,192 --> 01:04:49,067
We fire a chunk of fissionable material into a larger sphere

1097
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:51,150
with enough force to achieve criticality.

1098
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:54,783
-What do we think? Anyone?
-I've been thinking about implosion.

1099
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:58,275
Explosives around the sphere blast inwards, crushing the material.

1100
01:04:59,317 --> 01:05:02,234
-I'd like to investigate that idea.
-I'll talk to ordnance.

1101
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:03,400
Get you blowing things up.

1102
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,478
-Progress?
-Nice to see you too.

1103
01:05:07,484 --> 01:05:08,775
Meet the British contingent.

1104
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,150
Dr. Oppenheimer. Klaus Fuchs.

1105
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:14,317
-How long have you been British?
-Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.

1106
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:17,317
Ah. Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1107
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:19,484
The school's up and running.

1108
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:21,984
-The bar.
-Always running.

1109
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:25,150
And I thought of a way to reduce support staff.

1110
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,442
-Is that...?
-Mrs. Serber, yes.

1111
01:05:28,612 --> 01:05:31,900
I've offered jobs to all the wives, admin, librarians, computation.

1112
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:33,984
We cut down on staff, keep families together.

1113
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:36,150
-Are these women qualified?
-Don't be absurd.

1114
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:38,359
These are some of the brightest minds in our community.

1115
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,817
And they're already security cleared.

1116
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:42,688
I've informed General Groves you've been holding cross-divisional

1117
01:05:42,712 --> 01:05:45,275
open discussions on a nightly basis.
-Shut them down.

1118
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,317
Compartmentalization is the key

1119
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:49,150
to maintaining security...
-Only the top men.

1120
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:51,150
Who presumably communicate with subordinates.

1121
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:53,034
These men aren't stupid. They can be discreet.

1122
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,025
-I don't like it.
-You don't like anything enough

1123
01:05:55,067 --> 01:05:56,400
for that to be a fair test.

1124
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:04,900
Once a week. Top men only.

1125
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:07,234
-I'd like to bring my brother here.
-No.

1126
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,358
Nichols?

1127
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:14,525
I still haven't heard that my security clearance has been approved.

1128
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,484
-It hasn't.
-I'm going to Chicago tomorrow.

1129
01:06:16,775 --> 01:06:17,776
Well, you should wait.

1130
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,775
You are aware that the Nazis have a two-year head start?

1131
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,900
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact that your security clearance

1132
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:24,995
is proving difficult to obtain is not my fault.

1133
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:26,299
It's yours.

1134
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:29,123
It may not be your fault, but it's your problem. Because I'm going.

1135
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:32,025
And how many people were in these, uh...

1136
01:06:32,817 --> 01:06:34,817
open discussions?

1137
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,273
Too many. Compartmentalization was supposed to be the protocol.

1138
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:38,734
We were in a race against the Nazis.

1139
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:41,109
And now the race is against the Soviets.

1140
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:45,692
-Not unless we start it.
-Robert, they just fired the starting gun.

1141
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:48,203
What's the nature of the device they detonated?

1142
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:52,234
Data indicates it may have been a plutonium implosion device.

1143
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,773
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

1144
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,462
The Russians have a bomb.

1145
01:06:57,109 --> 01:07:00,359
-Truman needs to know what's next.
-What's next? Arms talks.

1146
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:01,734
-Arms talks?
-Obviously.

1147
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,900
What about the Super? Does Truman even know about it?

1148
01:07:05,942 --> 01:07:07,309
Did we brief him on that?

1149
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,950
Not specifically.

1150
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,036
We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb is technically feasible.

1151
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:14,442
Right, my understanding is that Teller proposed it.

1152
01:07:14,484 --> 01:07:15,609
-At Los Alamos?
-Yes.

1153
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,942
Teller's designs have always been wildly impractical.

1154
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:20,984
You'd have to deliver by oxcart, not airplane.

1155
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:23,025
-Oppie!
-I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,

1156
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:24,359
do you want to comment?

1157
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:27,194
No.

1158
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:31,234
Because if it can put us ahead again,

1159
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:36,275
the President of the United States needs to know about it.

1160
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:41,150
And if the Russians know about it already from a spy,

1161
01:07:41,352 --> 01:07:44,344
at Los Alamos, then we've got to get going.

1162
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,969
There's no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1163
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:48,317
Robert.

1164
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,734
They put it under the football stadium?

1165
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:56,442
The field's not in use anymore.

1166
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:58,113
Just as well.

1167
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,900
-Oppie!
-Dr. Fermi.

1168
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,609
-I hear you've got a little town.
-Yes, come and see.

1169
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:13,067
Who could think straight in a place like that, huh?

1170
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:15,775
Everybody will go crazy.

1171
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:19,109
Thank you the vote of confidence, Szilard.

1172
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:23,067
Do we really... do we really need that in the notes?

1173
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,570
Are you gonna try it out?

1174
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,234
We did.

1175
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,817
The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.

1176
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:32,859
Didn't Groves tell you?

1177
01:08:33,942 --> 01:08:34,952
No.

1178
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,734
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1179
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,067
I tried personnel.

1180
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:48,817
-They asked if I could type.
-Can you?

1181
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:51,650
Harvard forgot to teach that on the graduate chemistry course.

1182
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:56,109
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here on the plutonium team.

1183
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:03,817
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?

1184
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:05,692
-Visiting the met.
-Why?

1185
01:09:05,734 --> 01:09:06,900
-You can't...
-Why?

1186
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:08,275
Because we, we have every right...

1187
01:09:08,317 --> 01:09:12,317
You have just the rights that I give you. No more, no less.

1188
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:15,775
We are adults trying to run a project here. This is ridiculous.

1189
01:09:16,567 --> 01:09:17,569
Tell him!

1190
01:09:18,995 --> 01:09:21,525
Compartmentalization is the protocol we agreed to.

1191
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:26,192
Enough of this madhouse. Nobody can work under these conditions.

1192
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:29,859
You know what? Generalissimo, I quit!

1193
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:31,734
Thanks for nothing.

1194
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:35,317
Better off without him.

1195
01:09:36,984 --> 01:09:39,734
Aren't you more concerned about his discretion out there?

1196
01:09:41,025 --> 01:09:42,026
We'll have him killed.

1197
01:09:44,275 --> 01:09:45,276
I'm just kidding.

1198
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,067
No, he hates me, not America.

1199
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:51,317
You know, General, not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

1200
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:53,234
I don't think I understand.

1201
01:09:53,817 --> 01:09:57,352
You didn't hire me despite my left-wing past. You hired me because of it.

1202
01:09:58,525 --> 01:09:59,984
So you could control me.

1203
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:04,203
No, I'm not that subtle. I'm just a humble soldier.

1204
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:08,442
You're neither humble, nor just a soldier. You studied engineering at MIT.

1205
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,817
-Guilty as charged.
-Well, now we understand each other,

1206
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:12,692
perhaps you can get me my security clearance,

1207
01:10:12,734 --> 01:10:14,609
so I can perform this miracle for you.

1208
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:22,025
General Groves, were you aware

1209
01:10:22,067 --> 01:10:25,442
of Dr. Oppenheimer's left-wing associations when you appointed him?

1210
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:27,734
I was aware that there were suspicions about him.

1211
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:30,775
I was aware he had a very extreme liberal background.

1212
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:34,204
In your opinion, would he ever consciously commit a disloyal act?

1213
01:10:34,298 --> 01:10:35,900
I would be amazed if he did.

1214
01:10:36,048 --> 01:10:38,594
So you had complete confidence in his integrity?

1215
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:41,567
At Los Alamos, yes. Which is where I really knew him.

1216
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:44,243
Do you know that your security officers on the project

1217
01:10:44,298 --> 01:10:46,609
advised you against the clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1218
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:50,525
They could not, and would not, clear him until I insisted.

1219
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:52,567
And it's safe to say that you had pretty good knowledge

1220
01:10:52,609 --> 01:10:54,900
of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.
-I did.

1221
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,567
Well, then there's only really one question I need answered here today.

1222
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:02,900
In light of the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1223
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:04,609
Do you have the guidelines?

1224
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:14,734
Under current AEC guidelines,

1225
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,900
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1226
01:11:30,192 --> 01:11:31,609
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1227
01:11:33,154 --> 01:11:35,400
My god. What a trek.

1228
01:11:36,317 --> 01:11:38,775
-That's why you need a liaison.
-I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1229
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:42,234
You're gonna be okay. This way, gentlemen.

1230
01:11:52,734 --> 01:11:54,387
-Dr. Lawrence.
-Leslie.

1231
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:57,109
I'd like to remind you what we talked about at Berkeley.

1232
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:59,067
Compartmentalization, I understand completely.

1233
01:12:14,442 --> 01:12:15,734
Greetings from Berkeley.

1234
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,817
I am here to update you on our progress and solicit your input.

1235
01:12:19,278 --> 01:12:21,649
To do so, I am going to have to share a few things that

1236
01:12:21,692 --> 01:12:23,400
General Groves told me not to.

1237
01:12:24,192 --> 01:12:26,942
Sorry General, I said I understood, not that I agreed.

1238
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,317
Okay. Gentlemen, to business!

1239
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:32,734
There were rumors of espionage

1240
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:34,775
at Los Alamos.
-Unsubstantiated.

1241
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,150
I'm told that there were communists

1242
01:12:37,192 --> 01:12:38,734
on the project.
-We didn't knowingly employ...

1243
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:40,900
I just want to know, were any of them involved

1244
01:12:40,942 --> 01:12:42,359
in discussions of the Super?

1245
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:45,275
I seem to remember you demanding your brother come to Los Alamos.

1246
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:48,039
-My brother had left the party by then.
-What about Lomanitz?

1247
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:51,234
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos. He was a liaison.

1248
01:12:51,525 --> 01:12:54,025
Our security was tight, as former Colonel Nichols well knows.

1249
01:12:54,067 --> 01:12:56,741
Our security was as tight as it could be given the personalities involved,

1250
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:57,834
but attempts were made.

1251
01:12:58,234 --> 01:13:00,817
-What is that supposed to mean?
-We've all read his file here.

1252
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,734
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?

1253
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:06,942
Or the Chevalier incident?

1254
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:12,569
Excuse me.

1255
01:13:15,234 --> 01:13:17,109
Lomanitz, line one!

1256
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,025
Hello, Rossi. What?

1257
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:28,067
Okay, just calm down.

1258
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:30,442
There's been another screwup.

1259
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:33,817
-Lomanitz just got drafted.
-We are at war, Doctor.

1260
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:37,025
Don't be an asshole, Nichols. We need this kid. Fix it, will you?

1261
01:13:37,567 --> 01:13:38,514
It wasn't a mistake.

1262
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:41,403
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying to unionize the radiation lab.

1263
01:13:41,692 --> 01:13:44,442
-He promised to quit all that.
-Well, he hasn't.

1264
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,321
The security officer at Berkeley is concerned about communist infiltration

1265
01:13:48,408 --> 01:13:51,567
-FAECT.
through that union, the FA...
-FAECT.

1266
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:58,025
While I'm there next week, I'll... drop in to see him.

1267
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,871
Your Q clearance came through.

1268
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,902
It's important you not maintain or renew any questionable associations.

1269
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:16,275
Doctor, did you think social contacts

1270
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:20,567
between a person engaged on secret war work and communists was dangerous?

1271
01:14:20,609 --> 01:14:23,359
My awareness of the danger would be greater today.

1272
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:26,900
I mean, it's fair to say that during the war years,

1273
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:30,234
you felt that such contacts were potentially dangerous.

1274
01:14:36,942 --> 01:14:38,859
Were conceivably dangerous, yes.

1275
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,901
I mean, really!

1276
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:43,150
Known communists.

1277
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:47,367
Look...

1278
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:52,484
I've had a lot of secrets in my head for a long time.

1279
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:58,108
Doesn't matter who I associate with, I don't talk about those secrets.

1280
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:06,984
You said in your statement

1281
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:12,859
that you had to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1282
01:15:14,817 --> 01:15:15,826
You left.

1283
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:18,653
Not a word.

1284
01:15:19,484 --> 01:15:21,067
What did you think that would do to me?

1285
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:23,734
I wrote.

1286
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:25,234
Pages of nothing.

1287
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:29,692
Where did you go?

1288
01:15:31,817 --> 01:15:33,317
-I can't tell you.
-Why not?

1289
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,692
Because you're a communist.

1290
01:15:37,942 --> 01:15:39,359
Why did you have to see her?

1291
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:44,192
She had indicated a great desire to see me before we left.

1292
01:15:44,317 --> 01:15:48,317
At that time I couldn't, but I felt that she had to see me.

1293
01:15:49,317 --> 01:15:53,353
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment. She was extremely unhappy.

1294
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,984
Did you find out why she had to see you?

1295
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:02,692
Because she was still in love with me.

1296
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,234
You spent the night together, didn't you?

1297
01:16:20,484 --> 01:16:21,482
Yes.

1298
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:32,734
You drop in and out of my life, and you don't have to tell me why.

1299
01:16:33,859 --> 01:16:36,555
-And that's power.
-Not that I enjoy.

1300
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:40,192
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

1301
01:16:40,692 --> 01:16:42,650
But you have other priorities now.

1302
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:45,234
I have a wife and child.

1303
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:48,859
That's not what either of us is talking about.

1304
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,817
Jean... you asked me to come.

1305
01:16:57,359 --> 01:16:58,567
And I'm glad I did.

1306
01:17:00,025 --> 01:17:01,359
But I can't see you again.

1307
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,192
But what if I need you?

1308
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:12,400
You said you would always answer.

1309
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,651
Not a word?

1310
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:20,109
Did you think that consistent with good security?

1311
01:17:20,317 --> 01:17:21,484
As a matter of fact, it was.

1312
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,402
Not a word.

1313
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:25,900
When did you see her after that?

1314
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:35,859
I never saw her again.

1315
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,861
I can make the last train back to Princeton.

1316
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,567
Kitty, I didn't say anything that I hadn't already told you.

1317
01:17:48,609 --> 01:17:50,567
Today you said it to history, didn't you?

1318
01:17:50,609 --> 01:17:51,817
This is a closed hearing.

1319
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:56,525
If they don't release the transcript, I'm sure you will.

1320
01:17:56,567 --> 01:17:58,942
-I was under oath.
-Well, you were under an oath to me

1321
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:00,109
when you went to see Jean.

1322
01:18:01,734 --> 01:18:02,735
You know, you...

1323
01:18:03,942 --> 01:18:06,567
You sit there, day after day,

1324
01:18:07,525 --> 01:18:09,484
letting them pick our lives to pieces.

1325
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,484
Why won't you fight?

1326
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:19,692
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.

1327
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:28,400
Dr. Oppenheimer! This is an honor. Please, take a seat.

1328
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:31,532
No need. I just wanted to check whether I should...

1329
01:18:32,025 --> 01:18:34,445
talk to Lomanitz while I'm here, given your concerns.

1330
01:18:34,602 --> 01:18:37,368
I'd say that's really up to you, Professor, but I'd be cautious.

1331
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:38,859
Understood.

1332
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:41,484
Oh, and, um, as regards to the union,

1333
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:44,859
I wanted to give you a heads up on a man named Eltenton.

1334
01:18:45,109 --> 01:18:46,108
A heads up?

1335
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:49,525
Yes, just that he might bear watching, is all.

1336
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:52,484
I'd love to get more details.

1337
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:55,942
I have an appointment now, and I leave early tomorrow.

1338
01:18:56,056 --> 01:18:57,442
Well, come back as early as you like.

1339
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,275
Since you haven't time now.

1340
01:19:00,692 --> 01:19:04,025
-You went back the next morning.
-I did. I had to, really.

1341
01:19:05,484 --> 01:19:06,650
This time there was another man.

1342
01:19:08,859 --> 01:19:12,757
-He said his name was Pash.
-Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1343
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:17,775
Colonel Pash, could you please read from your memo dated June 29, 1943?

1344
01:19:20,025 --> 01:19:22,442
"Results of surveillance conducted on subject

1345
01:19:22,484 --> 01:19:25,192
"indicate further possible Communist Party connections."

1346
01:19:25,376 --> 01:19:28,942
"Subject met with and spent considerable time with one Jean Tatlock,

1347
01:19:28,984 --> 01:19:31,192
"a communist, the record of whom is attached."

1348
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:33,692
-The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer?
-Yes.

1349
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:36,900
-Whom you had not met?
-Not then, but soon after.

1350
01:19:37,074 --> 01:19:39,484
He's the head of security for the project. Shouldn't I know him?

1351
01:19:39,614 --> 01:19:41,067
No, he should know you.

1352
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,650
I would never put you in a room with Pash.

1353
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:44,709
Why not?

1354
01:19:44,817 --> 01:19:46,484
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz,

1355
01:19:46,817 --> 01:19:49,419
he told the FBI he was going to kidnap him,

1356
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:50,984
take him out on a boat,

1357
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:53,817
and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

1358
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:59,275
General Groves has placed in me a certain responsibility,

1359
01:19:59,317 --> 01:20:03,734
and it's like having a child who I can't see, by remote control.

1360
01:20:05,109 --> 01:20:06,442
So to actually meet you is...

1361
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:10,184
-I won't take up too much of your time.
-Oh, no.

1362
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:11,984
Not at all. Whatever time you choose.

1363
01:20:13,317 --> 01:20:15,535
Mr. Johnson told me of the conversation you had yesterday,

1364
01:20:15,629 --> 01:20:18,192
which I'm very interested in. It's had me worried all day.

1365
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:22,525
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to Lomanitz without authorization.

1366
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:24,650
That's not the particular interest that I have.

1367
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:25,984
It's something a little bit more...

1368
01:20:27,817 --> 01:20:29,234
In my opinion, more serious.

1369
01:20:29,309 --> 01:20:30,650
And then when the FBI pointed out

1370
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:33,525
that such information wouldn't be admissible in court,

1371
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:35,275
Pash made it clear he had no intention

1372
01:20:35,317 --> 01:20:37,504
of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

1373
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,946
Now, the FBI talked him down, but that's the man you're dancing with.

1374
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:43,650
I gather you've heard there are other parties

1375
01:20:43,692 --> 01:20:45,525
interested in the work of the radiation lab?

1376
01:20:46,817 --> 01:20:50,942
A man attached to the Soviet consul indicated,

1377
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:54,984
through intermediate people, to people on this project,

1378
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:58,234
that he was in a position to transmit information.

1379
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:00,734
Well, why would anyone on the project want to do that?

1380
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:06,275
Frankly, I can see that there might be an argument for the Commander-in-Chief

1381
01:21:06,317 --> 01:21:09,714
informing the Russians, they're our allies, after all, but...

1382
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:12,112
I don't like the idea of it going out the back door.

1383
01:21:12,484 --> 01:21:14,692
It might not hurt to be on the lookout for it.

1384
01:21:16,109 --> 01:21:17,359
And you said that to Pash.

1385
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,734
I was trying to put it in the context of "Russia's not Germany".

1386
01:21:22,328 --> 01:21:26,692
鲍里斯・帕什是俄国东正教主教的儿子
Boris Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1387
01:21:26,734 --> 01:21:30,859
Born here, but in 1918 he went back to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks.

1388
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:33,859
This is a man who has killed communists with his own hands.

1389
01:21:34,442 --> 01:21:36,775
I'm not the judge of who should or should not have information.

1390
01:21:37,317 --> 01:21:39,567
It's my business to stop it from going through illegally.

1391
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,234
Could you be a little more specific?

1392
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:49,109
There's a man whose name was mentioned to me, a couple of times, Eltenton.

1393
01:21:50,859 --> 01:21:53,067
I believe he's a chemist who works at Shell.

1394
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:56,692
He talked to a friend of his,

1395
01:21:56,775 --> 01:21:59,442
who's an acquaintance of someone on the project.

1396
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:03,817
And you thought Pash would be satisfied with that?

1397
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,650
I was attempting to give them Eltenton without opening a can of worms.

1398
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:09,317
I told them a cock-and-bull story.

1399
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,817
-Did you lie to General Groves, too?
-No.

1400
01:22:12,317 --> 01:22:14,817
I admitted to him that I'd lied to Pash.

1401
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:17,942
Do you recall this conversation about the Chevalier incident?

1402
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:20,734
I've seen so many versions of it, uh...

1403
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,942
Wasn't confused before, but I'm certainly getting there now.

1404
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:27,025
-And what was your conclusion?
-That he was under the influence

1405
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:30,525
of the typical American schoolboy attitude

1406
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:33,734
that there's something wicked about telling on a friend.

1407
01:22:34,192 --> 01:22:37,984
Well now, might we know through whom the contact was made?

1408
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,692
That would involve people who are not to be involved in this.

1409
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:45,692
Is that someone a member of the project?

1410
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:49,713
A member of the faculty, yes, but not in the project, no.

1411
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:50,875
Ah...

1412
01:22:51,525 --> 01:22:55,734
So Eltenton made his approach through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley.

1413
01:22:58,025 --> 01:23:00,359
As far as I know, as far as I know, yes.

1414
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:04,900
But there... may have been... more than one person involved.

1415
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,859
Gentlemen, if I... if I seem uncooperative,

1416
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,484
I think you can understand it's because of my insistence

1417
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:17,531
on not getting innocent people into trouble.

1418
01:23:18,317 --> 01:23:21,067
You're trying to protect your friend. Who's protecting you?

1419
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,528
Well, you could.

1420
01:23:23,038 --> 01:23:25,567
-If you gave me the name...
-If you order me to, I'll do it.

1421
01:23:25,809 --> 01:23:28,650
That's a mistake, Robert. You need to volunteer this name.

1422
01:23:30,317 --> 01:23:31,645
Did he give you the name?

1423
01:23:31,778 --> 01:23:33,192
-He did.
-But not then, did he?

1424
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:34,359
-No.
-No, in fact,

1425
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,775
it was some months later, wasn't it?

1426
01:23:36,775 --> 01:23:37,608
It was.

1427
01:23:37,817 --> 01:23:39,984
-You see me as persistent.
-Well, you are...

1428
01:23:40,789 --> 01:23:42,359
you are persistent, but that is your job.

1429
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:45,883
And, and my job is to protect the people that work for me.

1430
01:23:46,156 --> 01:23:47,817
Instead of us going on certain steps,

1431
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:49,734
which may come to your attention...

1432
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,192
and be disturbing to you,

1433
01:23:53,817 --> 01:23:55,692
I would like to discuss those with you first.

1434
01:23:56,525 --> 01:23:59,734
I'm not formulating a plan, I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

1435
01:24:04,692 --> 01:24:07,775
In the months in between your interview with Dr. Oppenheimer,

1436
01:24:07,817 --> 01:24:11,900
and his eventual naming of Chevalier, did you expend resources trying to find

1437
01:24:11,942 --> 01:24:15,192
the name of the intermediary?
-Considerable resources, yes.

1438
01:24:15,942 --> 01:24:18,067
Without the name, our job was extremely difficult.

1439
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:21,359
-And when did you receive the name?
-I was gone by the time Oppenheimer

1440
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,917
finally offered it up.
-Gone?

1441
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,418
They felt my time would be better spent in Europe,

1442
01:24:25,609 --> 01:24:27,775
determining the status of the Nazi bomb project.

1443
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:29,289
Who did?

1444
01:24:30,442 --> 01:24:31,443
General Groves.

1445
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,567
He transferred me to London.

1446
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:42,609
It's a little early for a Christmas party.

1447
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:43,692
Something's up.

1448
01:24:44,567 --> 01:24:45,609
Tolman's been away.

1449
01:24:46,942 --> 01:24:47,947
Where?

1450
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:49,400
Ruth won't tell.

1451
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:00,734
Come on, Ruthie.

1452
01:25:00,984 --> 01:25:02,650
If you can't tell me, who can you tell?

1453
01:25:03,442 --> 01:25:05,234
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1454
01:25:06,025 --> 01:25:07,838
What makes you think I know where he is, anyway?

1455
01:25:08,067 --> 01:25:09,567
Because you do a pretty good job

1456
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:11,740
of knowing where Mr. Tolman is when it counts.

1457
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:13,737
Like now?

1458
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,817
Attention!

1459
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:21,692
Early Christmas present for you all.

1460
01:25:30,234 --> 01:25:32,484
The British pilot put me in the bomb bay.

1461
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:35,900
He showed me the oxygen, you know, but I messed it up.

1462
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:38,900
Um, when they opened me up in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1463
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:41,317
But I pretended I'd been napping.

1464
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:43,484
Please enjoy your party.

1465
01:25:44,984 --> 01:25:47,359
-Is it big enough?
-To end the war?

1466
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:50,067
To end all war.

1467
01:25:53,775 --> 01:25:57,275
Uh, Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.

1468
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:01,609
It was chilling, my old student working for the Nazis.

1469
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:05,192
He told me some things to draw me out.

1470
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:09,067
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

1471
01:26:09,192 --> 01:26:11,109
That sounds more like a reactor than a bomb.

1472
01:26:11,484 --> 01:26:13,109
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

1473
01:26:13,484 --> 01:26:15,817
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

1474
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:18,609
-As a moderator?
-Yes, instead of graphite.

1475
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:23,109
What?

1476
01:26:23,991 --> 01:26:25,025
He took a wrong turn.

1477
01:26:25,942 --> 01:26:26,945
We're ahead.

1478
01:26:27,025 --> 01:26:28,497
And with you here to help us, Niels...

1479
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:32,275
Sorry, could you give us a moment, gentlemen?

1480
01:26:39,109 --> 01:26:41,109
I am not here to help, Robert.

1481
01:26:41,817 --> 01:26:43,452
I knew you could do this without me.

1482
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:46,317
-Then why did you come?
-To talk about after.

1483
01:26:46,525 --> 01:26:50,317
The power you're about to reveal will forever outlive the Nazis.

1484
01:26:51,525 --> 01:26:52,984
And the world is not prepared.

1485
01:26:53,442 --> 01:26:56,859
"You can lift the stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed."

1486
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,817
We have to make the politicians understand this isn't a new weapon.

1487
01:27:00,859 --> 01:27:01,941
It's a new world.

1488
01:27:02,746 --> 01:27:04,859
I'll be out there doing what I can, but you...

1489
01:27:05,859 --> 01:27:08,192
You're an American Prometheus.

1490
01:27:08,546 --> 01:27:12,353
The man who gave them the power to destroy themselves.

1491
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,150
And they'll respect that.

1492
01:27:14,326 --> 01:27:16,150
Your work really begins.

1493
01:27:20,942 --> 01:27:23,150
I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.

1494
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,317
From San Francisco.

1495
01:27:33,692 --> 01:27:34,694
Robert!

1496
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:40,218
Robert?

1497
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,904
Robert.

1498
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:43,359
Robert.

1499
01:27:43,442 --> 01:27:44,567
God, what's the matter?

1500
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:46,235
What happened?

1501
01:27:48,025 --> 01:27:49,067
Her father called.

1502
01:27:50,109 --> 01:27:51,692
He found her yesterday in the bath.

1503
01:27:53,442 --> 01:27:54,445
Who?

1504
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:58,525
She's taken pills. Left a note, not signed.

1505
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:03,150
She took barbiturates, but there was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1506
01:28:07,109 --> 01:28:08,109
There was a note.

1507
01:28:08,775 --> 01:28:09,817
Jean Tatlock?

1508
01:28:16,942 --> 01:28:17,943
We were together.

1509
01:28:18,782 --> 01:28:20,109
She said she needed me. I...

1510
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:24,110
I told her I...

1511
01:28:24,609 --> 01:28:25,610
I wouldn't...

1512
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:27,027
I told her I...

1513
01:28:28,067 --> 01:28:29,317
No, it was me, it was me.

1514
01:28:32,534 --> 01:28:34,359
You don't get to commit the sin

1515
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:37,713
and then have us all feel sorry for you that it had consequences.

1516
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:43,109
Now you pull yourself together.

1517
01:28:47,234 --> 01:28:48,817
You know, people here depend on you.

1518
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:53,692
Donald, would you like to contribute here?

1519
01:28:53,734 --> 01:28:54,817
-Please, help me out.
-You're on your own, pal.

1520
01:28:54,859 --> 01:28:57,709
Bob, I'm not quitting my job because plutonium is radioactive.

1521
01:28:57,779 --> 01:28:59,942
We just don't know what it might do

1522
01:28:59,984 --> 01:29:02,275
to the female reproductive system.
-Your reproductive system

1523
01:29:02,317 --> 01:29:04,859
is more exposed than mine, presumably.
-Can we please?

1524
01:29:05,234 --> 01:29:08,442
-The implosion device is nowhere.
-We can't rush everything. Oppie, please.

1525
01:29:08,484 --> 01:29:11,025
Well, there's rushing and there's getting on with it, so pick one.

1526
01:29:11,067 --> 01:29:12,734
Wait, wait, wait. Neddermeyer is doing his job.

1527
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:15,692
Teller's not helping. You're not helping.

1528
01:29:15,734 --> 01:29:18,567
I've been asking for calculations on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1529
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:20,734
-The British can do it. Fuchs.
-Absolutely.

1530
01:29:21,067 --> 01:29:24,192
-It's your job, Teller.
-I'm engaged in research.

1531
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,432
On a hydrogen bomb we're not even building!

1532
01:29:35,442 --> 01:29:36,692
I won't work with that man.

1533
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,067
Oh. Let him go.

1534
01:29:39,734 --> 01:29:41,359
-He's a prima donna!
-I agree.

1535
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,067
-He should leave Los Alamos.
-Okay.

1536
01:29:44,294 --> 01:29:47,442
Kisti, you replace Neddermeyer. Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1537
01:29:47,484 --> 01:29:50,775
Lilli, you go on for Kisti, because he needs you.

1538
01:29:51,109 --> 01:29:52,734
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1539
01:29:52,775 --> 01:29:54,858
I'm putting you exclusively on the implosion device.

1540
01:29:55,442 --> 01:29:58,984
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

1541
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:16,817
-They won't let me leave!
-No, I won't let you leave.

1542
01:30:18,734 --> 01:30:20,859
Forget Hans, forget fission.

1543
01:30:21,619 --> 01:30:23,734
Stay here, research what you want.

1544
01:30:24,525 --> 01:30:26,567
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

1545
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:29,442
-We'll meet to discuss it.
-You don't have time to meet.

1546
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:33,359
You're a politician now, Robert. You've left physics behind many, many years ago.

1547
01:30:34,984 --> 01:30:35,979
Once a week.

1548
01:30:36,692 --> 01:30:37,984
One hour, you and me.

1549
01:30:44,442 --> 01:30:45,942
Now raise this fucking barrier!

1550
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:54,192
那么氢弹是你在洛斯阿拉莫斯监督开发的？
So the氢弹was under development on your watch at Los Alamos?

1551
01:30:54,859 --> 01:30:55,848
Yes.

1552
01:30:56,275 --> 01:30:59,692
And yet, after the war, you tried to deny it was viable.

1553
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:02,984
No, no, no. I pointed out technical difficulties with it.

1554
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:04,775
Didn't you try to kill it at the AEC meeting

1555
01:31:04,817 --> 01:31:06,359
after the Russian bomb test?
-No.

1556
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:09,400
But that was the recommendation of the AEC, was it not?

1557
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:12,484
After hours of discussion about the best response.

1558
01:31:13,025 --> 01:31:17,984
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power of an A-bomb.

1559
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:22,359
Its only intended target would be the largest cities.

1560
01:31:23,234 --> 01:31:25,192
-It's a weapon of mass genocide.
-Izzy.

1561
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,484
Draw some circles on this side of the map,

1562
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,275
where they would target us, starting with New York.

1563
01:31:30,317 --> 01:31:31,359
-That's fair.
-D.C.

1564
01:31:31,525 --> 01:31:34,109
It's a weapon of attack with no defensive value.

1565
01:31:34,442 --> 01:31:35,798
-Deterrence.
-Deterrence?

1566
01:31:35,817 --> 01:31:39,650
Do we really need more deterrence than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

1567
01:31:39,734 --> 01:31:43,942
You, you drown in ten feet of water or 10,000, what's the difference?

1568
01:31:44,192 --> 01:31:46,275
We can already drown Russia. They know it...

1569
01:31:46,317 --> 01:31:48,359
-Now they can drown us with...
-We're just escalating...

1570
01:31:59,692 --> 01:32:04,442
As I said, Teller's designs are still as impractical as they were during the war.

1571
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:07,275
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work, Oppie. You know that.

1572
01:32:07,317 --> 01:32:10,275
I don't believe we should commit all our resources to that chance.

1573
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,400
Then how would you have Truman reassure the American people?

1574
01:32:13,442 --> 01:32:15,692
Simply by limiting the spread of atomic weapons

1575
01:32:15,734 --> 01:32:17,942
through international control on nuclear energy.

1576
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:20,609
By which you mean world government.

1577
01:32:20,817 --> 01:32:23,317
The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended.

1578
01:32:23,484 --> 01:32:27,275
Well, I asked what Truman should do, right? The world's changed.

1579
01:32:27,317 --> 01:32:30,900
It's not fascism but communism that now threatens our survival.

1580
01:32:31,192 --> 01:32:34,525
Lewis, do you understand, if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1581
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:37,025
the Russians will have no choice but to build their own?

1582
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:38,567
Could they be working on one already?

1583
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:41,692
Based on information gathered from the spy at Los Alamos...

1584
01:32:41,734 --> 01:32:43,275
-No spy at Los Alamos.
-Gentlemen...

1585
01:32:43,317 --> 01:32:45,275
-There wasn't?
-Let's not get sidetracked.

1586
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,738
I say we use this moment to gain concessions from the Russians

1587
01:32:48,762 --> 01:32:51,900
by committing that we will not build a hydrogen bomb.

1588
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:53,650
Thereby revealing its existence.

1589
01:32:53,692 --> 01:32:55,618
Which you seem convinced they already know.

1590
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:56,870
Alright.

1591
01:32:57,025 --> 01:33:00,692
At this point, I'd like the committee members to meet in privacy

1592
01:33:00,734 --> 01:33:02,794
to finalize our recommendations.

1593
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,484
I'm just not sure you want to go down this route.

1594
01:33:06,525 --> 01:33:08,675
Lewis, with respect, we are the advisory committee.

1595
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:09,984
We will give them our advice.

1596
01:33:10,692 --> 01:33:11,703
Good night.

1597
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:17,692
Dr. Oppenheimer? Hi.

1598
01:33:18,484 --> 01:33:21,375
William Borden. Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

1599
01:33:21,419 --> 01:33:22,461
Oh, yes, yes.

1600
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,025
During the war, I was a pilot.

1601
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:30,148
One night, flying back from a raid, I saw an amazing sight.

1602
01:33:30,192 --> 01:33:33,609
Like a meteor. A V2 rocket headed to England.

1603
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:36,738
I can't help but imagine what it will be

1604
01:33:36,762 --> 01:33:40,734
for such an enemy rocket to carry an atomic warhead.

1605
01:33:50,109 --> 01:33:52,025
Let's make sure we're not the ones to make that possible.

1606
01:33:58,817 --> 01:34:01,025
Oppie, I don't think you want to go up against Strauss.

1607
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:03,900
If we both speak, they listen to me.

1608
01:34:04,567 --> 01:34:08,317
When you speak, they hear a prophet. When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.

1609
01:34:08,593 --> 01:34:09,692
They'll listen to a prophet.

1610
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:13,275
A prophet can't be wrong. Not once.

1611
01:34:13,775 --> 01:34:16,906
Did you accuse Oppenheimer of sabotaging the development of the Super?

1612
01:34:17,192 --> 01:34:21,154
I was never one of those to bandy around terms like sabotage.

1613
01:34:21,775 --> 01:34:25,109
-But Mr. Borden was?
-As I understand it, possibly.

1614
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,025
How was Mr. Borden able to put together such a detailed indictment?

1615
01:34:29,067 --> 01:34:31,734
He was no longer a government employee, yet he appears to have had

1616
01:34:31,804 --> 01:34:34,530
unlimited access to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1617
01:34:34,817 --> 01:34:37,275
Might Mr. Nichols have given him access to the file?

1618
01:34:37,442 --> 01:34:39,734
Or someone else at the AEC?

1619
01:34:39,942 --> 01:34:41,817
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.

1620
01:34:42,567 --> 01:34:43,859
Is it your intention to suggest

1621
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,609
that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States?

1622
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:51,234
I've always assumed, and still assume, that he's loyal to the United States.

1623
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,808
I believe this, and I shall believe it,

1624
01:34:53,832 --> 01:34:56,067
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

1625
01:34:56,609 --> 01:35:00,380
Do you  or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

1626
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,609
If I may, look, when Hitler blew his brains out in that bunker,

1627
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:14,984
it is my humble opinion that there is no need

1628
01:35:15,067 --> 01:35:17,484
for that bomb to be seen anywhere except that test site.

1629
01:35:18,817 --> 01:35:20,775
Well, we at least have to take a moment to think about

1630
01:35:20,817 --> 01:35:23,942
whether the means justify the ends any longer because...

1631
01:35:27,025 --> 01:35:29,150
Germany is about to surrender.

1632
01:35:31,275 --> 01:35:35,400
It's no longer the enemy who are the greatest threat to mankind.

1633
01:35:35,442 --> 01:35:36,468
It's our work.

1634
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:41,192
Hitler's dead. It's true.

1635
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:44,525
But the Japanese fight on.

1636
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:46,567
Their defeat seems assured.

1637
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:49,067
Not if you're a G.I. preparing to invade.

1638
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:51,984
We can end this war.

1639
01:35:52,155 --> 01:35:55,192
But how do we justify using this weapon on human beings?

1640
01:35:58,775 --> 01:36:01,952
We're theorists. Yes?

1641
01:36:03,025 --> 01:36:07,400
We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us.

1642
01:36:08,442 --> 01:36:10,734
They won't fear it until they understand it,

1643
01:36:10,817 --> 01:36:13,192
and they won't understand it until they've used it.

1644
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:16,942
When the world learns the terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1645
01:36:17,567 --> 01:36:20,984
our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.

1646
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:24,192
A peace based on the kind of international cooperation

1647
01:36:24,234 --> 01:36:26,150
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1648
01:36:31,525 --> 01:36:34,317
-Progress?
-Two years and a billion dollars' worth.

1649
01:36:35,697 --> 01:36:38,692
-Hard to put a price on it.
-Not really, just add up the bills.

1650
01:36:38,734 --> 01:36:42,525
Rural free deliveries. 80 babies delivered the first year.

1651
01:36:43,234 --> 01:36:45,025
This year we've had ten, a month.

1652
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:48,234
Birth control is a little out of my jurisdiction, General.

1653
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,484
-Clearly.
-General.

1654
01:36:56,359 --> 01:36:59,275
Head down, everybody. Fuchs, head down.

1655
01:37:06,984 --> 01:37:07,985
That's the one!

1656
01:37:08,442 --> 01:37:09,567
Two viable bombs.

1657
01:37:10,036 --> 01:37:11,027
I need a date.

1658
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:14,900
September.

1659
01:37:15,181 --> 01:37:16,181
July.

1660
01:37:16,556 --> 01:37:18,025
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.

1661
01:37:18,942 --> 01:37:19,942
August.

1662
01:37:20,554 --> 01:37:21,564
July.

1663
01:37:22,234 --> 01:37:23,275
Tests in July.

1664
01:37:24,192 --> 01:37:25,234
But I need my brother.

1665
01:37:29,734 --> 01:37:32,109
Frank knows the desert. He's left politics behind.

1666
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:33,943
He's been working with Lawrence for two years now.

1667
01:37:41,525 --> 01:37:42,567
What do we call the test?

1668
01:37:44,715 --> 01:37:45,733
"Batter my heart,

1669
01:37:46,525 --> 01:37:47,609
"three-person'd God."

1670
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:49,192
What?

1671
01:37:50,859 --> 01:37:51,861
Trinity.

1672
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:03,275
You insisted on bringing on your brother Frank, a known communist.

1673
01:38:03,317 --> 01:38:04,318
Former communist.

1674
01:38:05,015 --> 01:38:06,650
You brought a known former communist...

1675
01:38:07,484 --> 01:38:10,775
onto America's most secret and important defense project.

1676
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:13,567
I knew my brother could be trusted. Absolutely.

1677
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:17,109
And you thought your judgment was sound on who on the team could be trusted?

1678
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:19,025
Fuchs, head down.

1679
01:38:19,692 --> 01:38:20,942
Okay. Everybody ready?

1680
01:38:30,942 --> 01:38:33,317
-I hope you learned something.
-Yeah, we've learned we're gonna need

1681
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:35,775
to be a lot further away.
-Well, figure it out, fast.

1682
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:38,359
We leave for Washington in the morning. We're going to give him a date.

1683
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:56,067
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

1684
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:58,984
If we don't act now, they're going to use this thing against Japan.

1685
01:38:59,505 --> 01:39:01,775
We booked a meeting with Truman, but somebody killed it.

1686
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:04,609
You're meeting the Secretary of War.

1687
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:08,442
Just because we're building it, doesn't mean we get to decide how it's used.

1688
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,859
History will judge us, Robert.

1689
01:39:12,317 --> 01:39:13,942
In Chicago, we put together a petition.

1690
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:16,525
I'm not... I'm not getting into this.

1691
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,650
Just tell me your concerns, and I'll relate them.

1692
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:26,369
My concerns? Germany's defeated.

1693
01:39:26,942 --> 01:39:28,359
Japan's not going to hold out alone.

1694
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,572
How could you know that? You got us into this.

1695
01:39:30,942 --> 01:39:33,900
You and Einstein, with your letter to Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

1696
01:39:33,942 --> 01:39:35,067
Against Germany.

1697
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:37,665
That's not how weapons manufacture works, Szilard.

1698
01:39:38,067 --> 01:39:39,400
Oppie, you have to help.

1699
01:39:39,442 --> 01:39:41,165
Fermi's in the meeting. Lawrence is in the meeting.

1700
01:39:41,212 --> 01:39:44,025
They're not you. You're the great salesman of science.

1701
01:39:44,484 --> 01:39:46,359
You can convince anyone of anything.

1702
01:39:47,942 --> 01:39:48,943
Even yourself.

1703
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:50,864
Excuse me.

1704
01:39:52,067 --> 01:39:56,442
The firestorm in Tokyo killed 100,000 people, mostly civilians.

1705
01:39:58,109 --> 01:40:01,109
I worry about America when we do these things and no one protests.

1706
01:40:01,567 --> 01:40:04,609
Pearl Harbor, and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific,

1707
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,192
buys a lot of latitude with the American public.

1708
01:40:07,763 --> 01:40:09,317
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?

1709
01:40:09,561 --> 01:40:12,942
Uh, the A-bomb might not cause as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

1710
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:14,350
What are we estimating?

1711
01:40:14,698 --> 01:40:16,567
In a medium-sized city, uh...

1712
01:40:17,275 --> 01:40:19,434
20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1713
01:40:19,525 --> 01:40:21,609
Yes, but don't underestimate

1714
01:40:21,650 --> 01:40:25,200
the psychological impact of an atomic explosion.

1715
01:40:25,817 --> 01:40:28,775
A pillar of fire, 10,000 feet tall,

1716
01:40:29,692 --> 01:40:31,567
deadly neutron effects for a mile,

1717
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:35,442
in all directions, from one single device.

1718
01:40:35,859 --> 01:40:39,275
Dropped from a barely-noticed B-29, the atomic bomb will be...

1719
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:43,067
a terrible revelation of divine power.

1720
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:46,150
If that's true, it would be definitive.

1721
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:48,025
World War II would be over.

1722
01:40:48,692 --> 01:40:49,734
Our boys would come home.

1723
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:51,443
Military targets?

1724
01:40:52,692 --> 01:40:54,400
But there aren't any big enough.

1725
01:40:54,817 --> 01:40:57,817
Perhaps a vital war plant,

1726
01:40:57,859 --> 01:41:00,484
with workers housed nearby.

1727
01:41:00,525 --> 01:41:03,400
And we could issue a warning to reduce civilian casualties.

1728
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:05,734
They'd send everything they have up against us,

1729
01:41:05,775 --> 01:41:07,484
and I'd be up in that plane.

1730
01:41:07,868 --> 01:41:10,400
If we announce it, and it fails to go off,

1731
01:41:10,884 --> 01:41:13,359
we'd scupper any chance of a Japanese surrender.

1732
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:17,942
Is there no way to demonstrate a bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?

1733
01:41:18,054 --> 01:41:21,025
We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms.

1734
01:41:21,462 --> 01:41:22,462
Twice.

1735
01:41:22,517 --> 01:41:24,369
Once to show the weapon's power,

1736
01:41:24,439 --> 01:41:27,692
and a second to show that we can keep doing this until they surrender.

1737
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:30,567
We have a list of 12 cities to choose from.

1738
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:32,442
Sorry, 11.

1739
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:35,359
I've taken Kyoto off the list,

1740
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,859
due to its cultural significance to the Japanese people.

1741
01:41:39,025 --> 01:41:40,984
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

1742
01:41:41,984 --> 01:41:43,109
It's a magnificent city.

1743
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:48,525
Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen.

1744
01:41:48,567 --> 01:41:51,109
According to my intelligence, which I cannot share with you,

1745
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:52,984
the Japanese people will not surrender,

1746
01:41:53,567 --> 01:41:54,984
under any circumstances,

1747
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:58,400
short of a successful and total invasion of the home islands.

1748
01:41:59,192 --> 01:42:01,567
Many lives would be lost, American and Japanese.

1749
01:42:02,359 --> 01:42:05,734
The use of the atomic bomb on Japanese cities will save lives.

1750
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:07,984
If we retain moral advantage.

1751
01:42:09,025 --> 01:42:10,734
-How so?
-Well, if we use this weapon

1752
01:42:10,775 --> 01:42:13,150
without informing our allies, they'll see it as a threat,

1753
01:42:13,192 --> 01:42:14,525
and we'll be in an arms race.

1754
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,692
How open can we be with the Soviets?

1755
01:42:16,984 --> 01:42:20,900
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from becoming part of the atomic world.

1756
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:24,484
-We've been told they have no uranium.
-You've been misinformed.

1757
01:42:24,525 --> 01:42:26,234
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1758
01:42:26,275 --> 01:42:29,275
The program needs to continue at full pace after the war.

1759
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:32,234
Secretary Simpson, if I may,

1760
01:42:32,442 --> 01:42:36,400
not all scientists on the project are in agreement.

1761
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:39,109
In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions.

1762
01:42:39,692 --> 01:42:41,984
-If you talk to scientists...
-The Manhattan Project has been plagued

1763
01:42:42,025 --> 01:42:44,857
from the start by certain scientists of...

1764
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:47,817
doubtful discretion, and uncertain loyalty.

1765
01:42:47,942 --> 01:42:49,692
One of 'em just tried to meet with the President.

1766
01:42:49,984 --> 01:42:51,317
Now, we need these men,

1767
01:42:51,734 --> 01:42:53,109
but as soon as it's practical,

1768
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:55,484
we should sever any such scientists from the program.

1769
01:42:55,525 --> 01:42:56,567
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1770
01:42:58,317 --> 01:43:00,109
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

1771
01:43:00,859 --> 01:43:03,775
perhaps we should invite their top scientist to Trinity.

1772
01:43:03,817 --> 01:43:07,192
President Truman has no intention of raising expectations

1773
01:43:07,484 --> 01:43:09,942
that Stalin be included in the atomic project.

1774
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,775
Informing him of our breakthrough,

1775
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,775
and presenting it as a means to win the war,

1776
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,525
need not make unkeepable promises.

1777
01:43:15,841 --> 01:43:17,734
But, the Potsdam Peace Conference in July

1778
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:20,900
will be President Truman's last chance to have that conversation.

1779
01:43:22,192 --> 01:43:23,775
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

1780
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:26,110
Absolutely.

1781
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,900
We will test fire before the conference.

1782
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:35,734
Ground zero. Observation posts

1783
01:43:35,775 --> 01:43:39,525
at 10,000 yards, north, south, and west.

1784
01:43:39,567 --> 01:43:42,025
-Where do we trigger from?
-South, 10,000.

1785
01:43:42,817 --> 01:43:45,942
And base camp is ten miles south here.

1786
01:43:46,192 --> 01:43:51,317
And there's a further observation post on that hill, 20 miles away.

1787
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,915
What's that, Frank? Trigger lines already went in.

1788
01:43:54,317 --> 01:43:57,942
The Air Force requested a line of lights for their B-29.

1789
01:43:58,067 --> 01:44:00,048
What B-29? Our bomb's on the tower.

1790
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:01,734
They want to use the test

1791
01:44:01,775 --> 01:44:04,109
to confirm a safe operating distance.
-That's risky.

1792
01:44:04,442 --> 01:44:06,150
But not as risky as dropping one over Japan,

1793
01:44:06,192 --> 01:44:08,109
and hoping that we were right about the blast radius.

1794
01:44:08,317 --> 01:44:10,609
Don't let 'em slow us down, we're firing on the 15th.

1795
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:13,067
-The 15th? That's not...
-The 15th.

1796
01:44:14,683 --> 01:44:15,683
15th.

1797
01:44:17,025 --> 01:44:19,091
So I'll be here at South Observation Point

1798
01:44:19,115 --> 01:44:20,859
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

1799
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:24,109
You'll all be assigned to Base Camp,

1800
01:44:24,317 --> 01:44:26,734
West Observation, or Far Observation.

1801
01:44:36,942 --> 01:44:38,859
Hey, whoa, whoa! Careful with that knife.

1802
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,525
Are those safe distances?

1803
01:44:44,305 --> 01:44:45,775
They're based on your calculations.

1804
01:44:46,025 --> 01:44:48,859
Time to stand behind your science, Hans. Literally.

1805
01:45:18,817 --> 01:45:20,275
What about the radiation cloud?

1806
01:45:20,692 --> 01:45:23,567
Without high winds, it should settle within 2-3 miles.

1807
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,234
Evacuation measures are in place.

1808
01:45:25,984 --> 01:45:28,692
But we need good weather for visibility, so it has to be fine.

1809
01:45:30,442 --> 01:45:31,444
Everybody out!

1810
01:45:41,859 --> 01:45:44,690
We go on the night of the 15th. It's a hard deadline.

1811
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:47,317
So if anyone has anything, speak now.

1812
01:45:49,055 --> 01:45:51,525
Okay, stop, stop! Everybody, mattresses.

1813
01:45:51,984 --> 01:45:53,692
Put the mattress there, underneath.

1814
01:46:10,942 --> 01:46:13,067
We could use a final implosion test.

1815
01:46:15,525 --> 01:46:17,650
-It couldn't hurt.
-Do it.

1816
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:21,025
Is there anything else that might stop us?

1817
01:46:56,097 --> 01:46:57,151
It's happening, isn't it?

1818
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:00,946
I'll send a message.

1819
01:47:02,067 --> 01:47:03,317
If it's gone our way:

1820
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:06,110
"Take in the sheets."

1821
01:47:10,484 --> 01:47:11,485
Robert.

1822
01:47:14,484 --> 01:47:15,485
Break a leg.

1823
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:29,862
Look.

1824
01:48:22,150 --> 01:48:25,067
Oppie's taken a very modest three kilotons.

1825
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:27,525
-Teller's view is 45.
-20!

1826
01:48:27,692 --> 01:48:29,984
20,000 tons of TNT.

1827
01:48:30,025 --> 01:48:33,234
And does anyone want the side action on atmospheric ignition?

1828
01:48:35,984 --> 01:48:37,317
Are you saying we'll have to delay?

1829
01:48:37,817 --> 01:48:39,109
I'm saying it would be prudent.

1830
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,442
This weather, has it reached the site?

1831
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,650
Bethe is calling to tell you the implosion test failed.

1832
01:48:48,692 --> 01:48:50,609
Hello, Hans? Yes, he's here.

1833
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:53,199
Yes.

1834
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:56,900
Is he wrong?

1835
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:58,100
-No.
-No?

1836
01:48:58,553 --> 01:48:59,538
No.

1837
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,442
So we're about to fire a dud?

1838
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,609
-No.
-Explain!

1839
01:49:03,898 --> 01:49:05,192
Well, I can't. I just, I...

1840
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:07,909
I just know, I know the implosion lenses will work.

1841
01:49:07,942 --> 01:49:10,525
If we fire these detonators and they don't trigger a reaction,

1842
01:49:10,567 --> 01:49:13,817
two years' worth of plutonium will be scattered across White Sands.

1843
01:49:13,984 --> 01:49:16,692
A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights.

1844
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:18,817
Oh, Jesus!

1845
01:49:25,775 --> 01:49:28,981
The wind's pickin' up at zero, not the rain. Lightning's circling.

1846
01:49:29,256 --> 01:49:31,569
Think it might be time to tell your men to get away

1847
01:49:31,593 --> 01:49:33,609
from the steel tower with the atomic bomb?

1848
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:38,870
Let's get to South Observation.

1849
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:40,942
Pull 'em out, and we can make our determination there.

1850
01:49:47,025 --> 01:49:48,900
The team hasn't slept in two nights!

1851
01:49:49,317 --> 01:49:52,567
If we stand down and make the bomb safe, we won't be back here for weeks!

1852
01:49:52,641 --> 01:49:53,900
And we'll miss Potsdam!

1853
01:49:54,275 --> 01:49:57,442
I gotta get word to Truman by seven, our window's closing.

1854
01:49:57,531 --> 01:49:59,817
-What is this doing?
-Raining, blowing, lightning.

1855
01:49:59,859 --> 01:50:01,961
-For how long, damnit?
-Holdin' strong!

1856
01:50:02,055 --> 01:50:03,317
It'll break before dawn.

1857
01:50:03,692 --> 01:50:05,275
-How could you know that?
-I know this desert.

1858
01:50:05,317 --> 01:50:07,984
Storm cools overnight. Just before dawn, storm breaks.

1859
01:50:08,275 --> 01:50:09,289
You could be right,

1860
01:50:09,313 --> 01:50:11,531
but schedule as late as possible.
-Five-thirty.

1861
01:50:12,275 --> 01:50:14,775
Sign your forecast. If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

1862
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:17,859
-Tell 'em all. Five-thirty.
-Five-thirty, five-thirty!

1863
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:25,359
Three years, 4,000 people, two billion dollars.

1864
01:50:25,609 --> 01:50:27,025
Well, if it doesn't go off,

1865
01:50:28,109 --> 01:50:29,150
we're both finished.

1866
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,859
I'm betting on three kilotons.

1867
01:50:35,067 --> 01:50:36,734
Anything less, they won't get what it is.

1868
01:50:37,692 --> 01:50:41,185
Now, what did Fermi mean by, uh, atmospheric ignition?

1869
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,817
Well, we had a moment where it looked like the chain reaction

1870
01:50:43,859 --> 01:50:46,150
from an atomic device might never stop.

1871
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,825
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

1872
01:50:49,275 --> 01:50:51,817
Why's Fermi still taking side bets on it?

1873
01:50:52,609 --> 01:50:54,161
Call it gallows humor.

1874
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:01,686
Wait, are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button,

1875
01:51:02,192 --> 01:51:03,359
we destroy the world?

1876
01:51:03,609 --> 01:51:06,442
Nothing in our research over three years supports that conclusion,

1877
01:51:07,275 --> 01:51:10,025
except as the most remote possibility.

1878
01:51:10,984 --> 01:51:13,067
-How remote?
-Chances are near-zero.

1879
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,651
Near-zero?

1880
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,400
What do you want from theory alone?

1881
01:51:20,984 --> 01:51:22,734
Zero would be nice.

1882
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:28,942
In exactly one hour...

1883
01:51:29,317 --> 01:51:32,109
and 58 minutes, we'll know.

1884
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:40,068
It's letting up.

1885
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:55,317
The arming party's left zero, they're heading this way.

1886
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:56,359
Throw on your switches.

1887
01:51:56,567 --> 01:51:59,275
Turn the cars! Ready for emergency evacuation.

1888
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:20,275
...welder's glass. Everybody take their places.

1889
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:22,942
Everybody take a welder's glass!

1890
01:52:24,817 --> 01:52:26,359
Everybody take a welder's glass!

1891
01:53:18,067 --> 01:53:19,070
20 minutes.

1892
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:24,401
20 minutes!

1893
01:53:35,734 --> 01:53:36,734
That's 20!

1894
01:53:40,442 --> 01:53:41,442
On the leg, please.

1895
01:53:43,075 --> 01:53:44,650
-Feynman?
-No.

1896
01:53:45,567 --> 01:53:47,525
The glass stops the UV.

1897
01:53:48,025 --> 01:53:49,150
What stops the glass?

1898
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:52,110
I'm heading to base camp.

1899
01:53:52,505 --> 01:53:53,505
Best of luck.

1900
01:53:54,525 --> 01:53:55,528
Robert?

1901
01:53:57,025 --> 01:53:58,109
Try not to blow up the world.

1902
01:54:10,567 --> 01:54:13,072
Watch that needle. If the detonators don't charge,

1903
01:54:13,189 --> 01:54:14,900
and the voltage drops below one volt,

1904
01:54:15,067 --> 01:54:17,484
you hit that button, you abort. Understood?

1905
01:54:18,306 --> 01:54:19,306
Understood.

1906
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,768
Two minutes to detonation.

1907
01:54:29,244 --> 01:54:30,244
Everybody down!

1908
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:34,067
Do not turn around until you see light reflected on the hills.

1909
01:54:35,484 --> 01:54:38,234
Then look at the explosion only through your welder's glass.

1910
01:54:38,275 --> 01:54:40,817
90 seconds to detonation.

1911
01:54:42,609 --> 01:54:44,942
80 seconds to detonation.

1912
01:54:45,859 --> 01:54:47,093
Is it rubbed in?

1913
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:48,918
Yeah.

1914
01:54:55,567 --> 01:54:58,234
60 seconds to detonation.

1915
01:55:13,150 --> 01:55:14,900
These things are hard on your heart.

1916
01:55:15,525 --> 01:55:16,525
30 seconds.

1917
01:55:22,275 --> 01:55:23,317
Detonators charged!

1918
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,110
17.

1919
01:55:35,197 --> 01:55:36,423
16.

1920
01:55:36,931 --> 01:55:38,141
15.

1921
01:55:38,525 --> 01:55:39,525
14.

1922
01:55:40,510 --> 01:55:41,526
13.

1923
01:55:42,234 --> 01:55:43,236
12.

1924
01:55:43,734 --> 01:55:44,737
11.

1925
01:55:45,635 --> 01:55:46,654
Ten.

1926
01:55:47,817 --> 01:55:48,823
Nine.

1927
01:55:49,775 --> 01:55:50,769
Eight.

1928
01:55:52,025 --> 01:55:53,034
Seven.

1929
01:55:54,525 --> 01:55:55,545
Six.

1930
01:55:57,442 --> 01:55:58,454
Five.

1931
01:56:00,067 --> 01:56:01,067
Four.

1932
01:56:02,609 --> 01:56:03,609
Three.

1933
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:06,150
Two.

1934
01:56:07,442 --> 01:56:08,234
One.

1935
01:57:41,484 --> 01:57:43,765
"And now I am become Death...

1936
01:57:46,154 --> 01:57:47,609
"the destroyer of worlds."

1937
01:58:21,317 --> 01:58:22,317
It worked.

1938
01:58:58,092 --> 01:58:59,277
You owe me ten dollars!

1939
01:59:02,068 --> 01:59:04,775
-Come on!
-I... I'm good for it, Kisti.

1940
01:59:05,883 --> 01:59:06,883
You are!

1941
01:59:07,813 --> 01:59:08,903
Yes, you are!

1942
01:59:46,633 --> 01:59:48,091
Get me Potsdam right away.

1943
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:00,966
Get a message to Kitty.

1944
02:00:01,591 --> 02:00:03,758
-We can't say anything.
-Tell her to take in the sheets.

1945
02:00:19,618 --> 02:00:21,258
-Hello?
-Hi, Kitty?

1946
02:00:21,299 --> 02:00:24,383
What? What? Charlotte? Charlotte, go ahead. Go ahead.

1947
02:00:24,466 --> 02:00:26,049
Oh, um, well, I don't know,

1948
02:00:26,091 --> 02:00:28,549
he just said to tell you to bring in the sheets.

1949
02:00:31,758 --> 02:00:32,760
Kitty?

1950
02:00:34,383 --> 02:00:36,591
Kitty? Kitty, are you still there?

1951
02:00:44,008 --> 02:00:47,133
If they detonate it too high in the air, the blast won't be as powerful.

1952
02:00:47,549 --> 02:00:50,758
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, we'll take it from here.

1953
02:01:01,633 --> 02:01:03,764
Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?

1954
02:01:04,716 --> 02:01:07,091
"Brief" would be an overstatement.

1955
02:01:07,133 --> 02:01:10,716
He referred to a powerful new weapon.

1956
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:16,091
Stalin... hoped we'd use it against Japan.

1957
02:01:17,633 --> 02:01:18,633
That's it?

1958
02:01:19,216 --> 02:01:22,424
Robert, we've given them an ace. It's for them to play the hand.

1959
02:01:24,841 --> 02:01:25,924
You're aiming for the sixth?

1960
02:01:27,076 --> 02:01:28,841
It's up to the CO in the Pacific.

1961
02:01:30,716 --> 02:01:31,924
Should I come with you to Washington?

1962
02:01:34,133 --> 02:01:35,133
What for?

1963
02:01:37,618 --> 02:01:38,799
Well, you keep me informed.

1964
02:01:40,649 --> 02:01:41,649
Of course.

1965
02:01:43,924 --> 02:01:44,925
As best I can.

1966
02:02:03,216 --> 02:02:05,633
Would the Japanese surrender if they knew what was coming?

1967
02:02:07,174 --> 02:02:08,179
I don't know.

1968
02:02:11,133 --> 02:02:12,508
Have you seen Szilard's petition?

1969
02:02:13,174 --> 02:02:15,049
How the hell does Szilard know about the Japanese?

1970
02:02:15,883 --> 02:02:16,883
You're not signing it, are you?

1971
02:02:18,008 --> 02:02:19,716
Many people have. A lot of people.

1972
02:02:20,469 --> 02:02:21,477
Edward...

1973
02:02:23,008 --> 02:02:25,799
the fact that we built this bomb does not give us any more,

1974
02:02:25,841 --> 02:02:27,466
any more right or responsibility

1975
02:02:27,591 --> 02:02:29,758
to decide how it's used than anyone else.

1976
02:02:30,133 --> 02:02:31,716
But we're the only people who know about it.

1977
02:02:32,466 --> 02:02:35,008
I've told Stimson the various opinions of the community.

1978
02:02:35,591 --> 02:02:36,590
But what's your opinion?

1979
02:02:38,133 --> 02:02:39,133
Once it's used...

1980
02:02:40,674 --> 02:02:42,341
nuclear war, perhaps...

1981
02:02:43,341 --> 02:02:44,544
all war...

1982
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:46,966
becomes unthinkable.

1983
02:02:47,924 --> 02:02:49,633
Until somebody builds a bigger one.

1984
02:03:10,966 --> 02:03:12,133
I thought they would call.

1985
02:03:12,508 --> 02:03:13,841
It's only the fifth.

1986
02:03:16,505 --> 02:03:18,133
In Japan, it's the sixth.

1987
02:03:31,341 --> 02:03:32,337
Charlotte?

1988
02:03:34,924 --> 02:03:35,926
Try Groves.

1989
02:03:37,478 --> 02:03:38,467
Anything?

1990
02:03:40,924 --> 02:03:43,174
-Charlotte?
-Truman's on the radio.

1991
02:03:44,633 --> 02:03:46,549
16 hours ago,

1992
02:03:47,549 --> 02:03:49,299
an American airplane

1993
02:03:49,716 --> 02:03:52,693
dropped one bomb on Hiroshima,

1994
02:03:54,383 --> 02:03:57,270
and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy.

1995
02:03:59,549 --> 02:04:01,633
The bomb has more power

1996
02:04:02,091 --> 02:04:05,133
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

1997
02:04:07,633 --> 02:04:09,341
It is an atomic bomb.

1998
02:04:12,258 --> 02:04:16,591
It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

1999
02:04:19,383 --> 02:04:20,386
Groves on one.

2000
02:04:26,591 --> 02:04:27,588
General?

2001
02:04:27,633 --> 02:04:29,799
I'm very proud of you, and all of your people.

2002
02:04:30,508 --> 02:04:31,508
It went alright?

2003
02:04:32,091 --> 02:04:34,341
Apparently it went with a tremendous bang.

2004
02:04:35,619 --> 02:04:39,424
Well, everyone here is feeling reasonably good about it.

2005
02:04:41,209 --> 02:04:42,424
It's been a long road.

2006
02:04:42,883 --> 02:04:45,049
I think one of the wisest things I ever did

2007
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:47,591
was when I selected the director of Los Alamos.

2008
02:04:51,008 --> 02:04:54,633
We have spent more than two billion dollars

2009
02:04:55,133 --> 02:04:58,633
on the greatest scientific gamble in history,

2010
02:04:59,508 --> 02:05:00,966
and we have won.

2011
02:05:06,883 --> 02:05:09,591
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2012
02:06:29,508 --> 02:06:30,508
The world...

2013
02:06:32,549 --> 02:06:33,633
will remember this day.

2014
02:06:52,966 --> 02:06:54,216
It's too soon to...

2015
02:06:55,216 --> 02:06:56,799
It's too soon to determine

2016
02:06:57,174 --> 02:06:58,883
what the results of the bombing are.

2017
02:07:02,383 --> 02:07:03,924
But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it.

2018
02:07:24,799 --> 02:07:25,800
I'm so proud.

2019
02:07:27,466 --> 02:07:29,216
So proud of what you have accomplished.

2020
02:07:37,133 --> 02:07:39,758
I just wish we had it in time to use against the Germans.

2021
02:09:29,508 --> 02:09:30,492
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2022
02:09:31,924 --> 02:09:32,908
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2023
02:09:34,216 --> 02:09:35,206
Nice picture.

2024
02:09:36,049 --> 02:09:37,174
President Truman will see you now.

2025
02:09:52,049 --> 02:09:54,799
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.

2026
02:09:54,841 --> 02:09:56,500
-Mr. President.
-Please.

2027
02:09:56,841 --> 02:09:57,860
Thank you.

2028
02:09:58,508 --> 02:09:59,633
Secretary Byrnes.

2029
02:10:02,424 --> 02:10:05,216
How's it feel to be the most famous man in the world?

2030
02:10:06,341 --> 02:10:08,966
You helped save a lot of American lives.

2031
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:13,575
-What we did at Hiroshima was...
-And Nagasaki.

2032
02:10:14,758 --> 02:10:16,138
Obviously.

2033
02:10:16,924 --> 02:10:19,966
Your invention let us bring our boys home.

2034
02:10:20,008 --> 02:10:23,107
Well, it was hardly... my invention.

2035
02:10:23,508 --> 02:10:25,424
It was you on the cover of Time.

2036
02:10:28,466 --> 02:10:31,966
Jim tells me you're concerned about an arms race with the Soviets.

2037
02:10:32,258 --> 02:10:33,299
Ah, yes, ah...

2038
02:10:34,966 --> 02:10:35,951
Well, um...

2039
02:10:36,424 --> 02:10:40,299
it's that, uh, now is our chance to secure...

2040
02:10:41,674 --> 02:10:44,466
international cooperation on atomic energy,

2041
02:10:44,508 --> 02:10:46,758
and-and-and I'm concerned...

2042
02:10:46,799 --> 02:10:49,596
Do you know when the Soviets are gonna have the bomb?

2043
02:10:50,049 --> 02:10:51,549
I don't think I could give a...

2044
02:10:51,674 --> 02:10:52,674
Never!

2045
02:10:53,924 --> 02:10:54,924
Never.

2046
02:10:55,549 --> 02:10:58,799
Mr. President, the Russians have good physicists,

2047
02:10:58,841 --> 02:11:01,466
and, and abundant resources...
-Abundant?

2048
02:11:01,549 --> 02:11:02,550
Yes.

2049
02:11:03,081 --> 02:11:04,799
I don't think so.

2050
02:11:05,299 --> 02:11:08,508
Well, they'll put everything they have in...

2051
02:11:12,591 --> 02:11:16,049
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.

2052
02:11:17,466 --> 02:11:18,727
What should we do with it?

2053
02:11:19,091 --> 02:11:20,424
Give it back to the Indians.

2054
02:11:28,674 --> 02:11:31,049
Um, Dr. Oppenheimer...

2055
02:11:32,049 --> 02:11:34,508
if what you say about the Soviets is true,

2056
02:11:35,216 --> 02:11:39,091
we have to build up Los Alamos, not shut it down.

2057
02:11:42,924 --> 02:11:44,091
Mr. President...

2058
02:11:45,841 --> 02:11:46,841
Umm...

2059
02:11:50,008 --> 02:11:53,424
I feel that I have blood on my hands.

2060
02:12:13,424 --> 02:12:16,424
You think anyone in Hiroshima, or...

2061
02:12:17,492 --> 02:12:21,424
Nagasaki, gives a shit who built the bomb?

2062
02:12:25,258 --> 02:12:26,883
They care who dropped it.

2063
02:12:28,258 --> 02:12:29,259
I did.

2064
02:12:32,091 --> 02:12:34,049
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2065
02:12:40,841 --> 02:12:42,133
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2066
02:12:53,841 --> 02:12:56,049
Don't let that crybaby back in here!

2067
02:13:01,717 --> 02:13:04,591
Robert saw that hand-wringing got him nowhere.

2068
02:13:05,633 --> 02:13:07,883
By the time I met him, he'd fully embraced

2069
02:13:07,924 --> 02:13:09,841
his "Father of the Bomb" reputation.

2070
02:13:10,758 --> 02:13:13,299
And used his profile to influence policy.

2071
02:13:22,466 --> 02:13:23,883
Doctor, in the years following the war,

2072
02:13:23,924 --> 02:13:26,174
would you say that you exerted a great influence

2073
02:13:26,216 --> 02:13:28,049
on the atomic policies of the USA?

2074
02:13:28,091 --> 02:13:30,258
I think "great" would be an overstatement.

2075
02:13:30,466 --> 02:13:32,674
Really? I mean, look at the issue of isotopes.

2076
02:13:32,716 --> 02:13:36,299
Were you not personally responsible for destroying all opposition to their export?

2077
02:13:36,521 --> 02:13:38,341
...could use a bottle of beer

2078
02:13:38,966 --> 02:13:40,884
in making atomic weapons. In fact, you do.

2079
02:13:41,299 --> 02:13:45,049
I was the spokesman, but the opinion among scientists was unanimous.

2080
02:13:45,341 --> 02:13:48,383
All along, with McCarthy on the rise, he knew he was vulnerable.

2081
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:52,633
His brother was blacklisted by every university in the country.

2082
02:13:54,299 --> 02:13:57,008
Lomanitz wound up working the railroad, laying track.

2083
02:13:59,174 --> 02:14:01,174
Chevalier went into exile.

2084
02:14:03,466 --> 02:14:05,966
But none of that stopped Robert

2085
02:14:06,008 --> 02:14:08,688
from pushing the GAC to recommend arms control,

2086
02:14:08,712 --> 02:14:09,716
instead of the H-Bomb.

2087
02:14:12,008 --> 02:14:15,133
He was devastated when Truman rejected their recommendation.

2088
02:14:17,424 --> 02:14:19,091
I miss Richard more than I can bear.

2089
02:14:19,424 --> 02:14:20,883
I know, Ruth. I know.

2090
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:24,216
I'm just glad he didn't live to see where this has all gone.

2091
02:14:27,383 --> 02:14:30,091
Here comes the birthday boy, to gloat...

2092
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:31,535
Have fun.

2093
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:34,966
Robert, my son and his fiancée

2094
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:37,508
are desperate to meet the father of the atomic bomb, so...

2095
02:14:37,532 --> 02:14:38,524
Hello.

2096
02:14:46,758 --> 02:14:47,760
Is this a bad time?

2097
02:14:48,758 --> 02:14:49,802
What do you think, Lewis?

2098
02:14:50,425 --> 02:14:52,008
Well, I think it must have been a blow for you.

2099
02:14:52,675 --> 02:14:53,676
For the world.

2100
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:58,050
The world? What does Fuchs mean to the rest of the world?

2101
02:14:59,966 --> 02:15:00,993
Fuchs?

2102
02:15:01,423 --> 02:15:02,424
Klaus Fuchs?

2103
02:15:04,433 --> 02:15:06,550
Oh dear. You haven't heard.

2104
02:15:09,883 --> 02:15:11,800
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist

2105
02:15:11,841 --> 02:15:14,425
that you put onto the implosion team at Los Alamos.

2106
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:16,675
Turns out he was...

2107
02:15:17,269 --> 02:15:19,550
He was spying for the Soviets the whole time.

2108
02:15:20,110 --> 02:15:21,100
I'm sorry.

2109
02:15:27,008 --> 02:15:29,532
After the truth about Fuchs came out,

2110
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,841
the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

2111
02:15:32,050 --> 02:15:33,550
He knew his phone was tapped.

2112
02:15:34,716 --> 02:15:35,800
He was followed everywhere.

2113
02:15:36,925 --> 02:15:38,050
His trash picked through.

2114
02:15:42,091 --> 02:15:44,175
But he never stopped speaking his mind.

2115
02:15:44,716 --> 02:15:45,883
A man of conviction.

2116
02:15:46,466 --> 02:15:49,175
And maybe he thought fame could actually protect him.

2117
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:53,883
When Eisenhower took office, he saw one more chance.

2118
02:15:56,133 --> 02:15:57,050
He took it.

2119
02:15:57,092 --> 02:16:00,258
America and Russia may be likened...

2120
02:16:01,633 --> 02:16:03,633
to two scorpions in a bottle.

2121
02:16:03,869 --> 02:16:07,091
Each capable of killing the other,

2122
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:10,058
but only at the risk of his own life.

2123
02:16:10,758 --> 02:16:12,800
Now, there are various aspects of this policy...

2124
02:16:12,841 --> 02:16:17,216
A lot of scientists blame me, but how was I supposed to protect him?

2125
02:16:17,258 --> 02:16:19,300
...are too secret for discussion.

2126
02:16:19,508 --> 02:16:21,341
Candor is the only remedy.

2127
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:25,175
Officials in Washington need to start leveling with the American people.

2128
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:29,008
That was the last straw for Robert's enemies.

2129
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:31,673
So he had to lose his security clearance.

2130
02:16:31,841 --> 02:16:34,050
And with it, his credibility.

2131
02:16:34,591 --> 02:16:36,216
But how could they do it?

2132
02:16:36,758 --> 02:16:38,008
He was a war hero.

2133
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:40,091
He'd already told everyone about his past.

2134
02:16:40,133 --> 02:16:41,794
Borden dredged it all up.

2135
02:16:42,133 --> 02:16:45,425
How could Borden get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2136
02:16:45,466 --> 02:16:46,466
Could it have been Nichols?

2137
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,341
No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2138
02:16:49,216 --> 02:16:52,925
Whoever did unleashed a firestorm that burned a path in the White House,

2139
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:55,300
right to my desk at the AEC.

2140
02:16:56,258 --> 02:16:57,675
You seen 'em in there, right?

2141
02:16:58,466 --> 02:17:00,849
I've worked my whole life to get here.

2142
02:17:01,716 --> 02:17:03,841
The cabinet of the United States of America,

2143
02:17:03,883 --> 02:17:05,591
and now, in front of the entire country,

2144
02:17:05,966 --> 02:17:07,466
they want to put me back in my place.

2145
02:17:09,341 --> 02:17:10,758
A lowly shoe salesman.

2146
02:17:11,787 --> 02:17:13,633
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2147
02:17:13,925 --> 02:17:15,925
I think we can get the Senate to grasp

2148
02:17:15,966 --> 02:17:18,216
that you did your duty, painful though it was.

2149
02:17:18,425 --> 02:17:21,341
-Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?
-Hill will be fine.

2150
02:17:21,383 --> 02:17:24,716
I don't really know him, but he was one of Szilard's boys in Chicago.

2151
02:17:24,758 --> 02:17:26,457
And they'd never forgave Robert for not

2152
02:17:26,481 --> 02:17:28,716
supporting the petition against bombing Japan.

2153
02:17:30,008 --> 02:17:33,008
This was taken 31 days after the bombing.

2154
02:17:34,341 --> 02:17:38,508
Virtually everyone in the streets, for nearly a mile around,

2155
02:17:39,341 --> 02:17:40,925
was instantly and seriously...

2156
02:17:41,758 --> 02:17:42,746
burned.

2157
02:17:43,758 --> 02:17:47,117
The Japanese spoke of people who

2158
02:17:47,341 --> 02:17:51,091
wore striped clothing, upon whom the skin was burned in stripes.

2159
02:17:52,383 --> 02:17:54,305
There were many who thought themselves lucky,

2160
02:17:55,038 --> 02:17:57,258
who climbed out of the ruins of their homes,

2161
02:17:57,675 --> 02:17:58,800
only slightly injured.

2162
02:18:00,667 --> 02:18:01,675
But they died anyway.

2163
02:18:03,133 --> 02:18:05,466
They died days, or weeks later,

2164
02:18:06,390 --> 02:18:08,925
from iridium-like rays emitted in great numbers

2165
02:18:09,591 --> 02:18:11,175
at the moment of the explosion.

2166
02:18:13,050 --> 02:18:14,716
Did you read this crap in the papers?

2167
02:18:15,091 --> 02:18:16,675
A British physicist is saying

2168
02:18:16,925 --> 02:18:19,591
the atomic bombings were not the last act of World War II,

2169
02:18:19,902 --> 02:18:22,633
but the first act of this cold war with Russia.

2170
02:18:23,292 --> 02:18:24,281
Which physicist?

2171
02:18:24,633 --> 02:18:26,883
I think you knew him. Patrick Blackett.

2172
02:18:30,258 --> 02:18:33,133
He may not be wrong. Stimson is now telling me

2173
02:18:33,216 --> 02:18:36,133
we bombed an enemy that was essentially defeated.

2174
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:38,466
Robert, you've all the influence now.

2175
02:18:39,805 --> 02:18:40,792
Please,

2176
02:18:41,508 --> 02:18:43,550
urge them to continue my research on the Super.

2177
02:18:43,883 --> 02:18:45,508
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2178
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:46,908
Why not?

2179
02:18:47,258 --> 02:18:48,910
It's not the right use of our resources.

2180
02:18:49,425 --> 02:18:50,758
Is that what you really believe?

2181
02:18:51,741 --> 02:18:55,508
J. Robert Oppenheimer? Sphinx-like guru of the atom?

2182
02:18:57,175 --> 02:18:58,675
Nobody knows what you believe.

2183
02:18:59,883 --> 02:19:01,425
Do you? Hmm?

2184
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:06,133
One final time, our program director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2185
02:19:08,008 --> 02:19:09,966
I hope that in years to come,

2186
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:12,591
you will look back on your work here with pride.

2187
02:19:13,675 --> 02:19:17,608
But today, that pride must be tempered with a profound concern.

2188
02:19:19,648 --> 02:19:23,133
If atomic weapons are to be added to the arsenals of a warring world,

2189
02:19:24,883 --> 02:19:28,716
then the day will come when people will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2190
02:19:33,175 --> 02:19:34,191
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

2191
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:36,258
Stopped off to get this.

2192
02:19:37,383 --> 02:19:38,633
Seems pretty favorable.

2193
02:19:39,925 --> 02:19:42,008
There's Oppenheimer. What's the caption?

2194
02:19:42,136 --> 02:19:45,073
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer. Strauss fought him...

2195
02:19:47,009 --> 02:19:48,091
"and the US won."

2196
02:19:49,675 --> 02:19:50,675
That'll work.

2197
02:19:51,066 --> 02:19:52,758
Those were your words from the other day.

2198
02:19:53,008 --> 02:19:54,009
We needed to pivot.

2199
02:19:54,831 --> 02:19:57,472
But how would you know what Time Magazine was gonna write?

2200
02:19:57,675 --> 02:19:59,216
Henry Luce is a friend.

2201
02:20:07,133 --> 02:20:09,341
You sat here and let me tell you how it's done,

2202
02:20:10,133 --> 02:20:11,966
but you've been far ahead all along.

2203
02:20:12,525 --> 02:20:14,508
Survival in Washington.

2204
02:20:15,425 --> 02:20:17,050
It's about knowing how to get things done.

2205
02:20:18,133 --> 02:20:19,157
Right.

2206
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:22,591
What was it you said about Borden?

2207
02:20:23,265 --> 02:20:25,008
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

2208
02:20:27,521 --> 02:20:30,175
I'm beginning to think Borden was holding the knife for you.

2209
02:20:33,279 --> 02:20:35,133
It's gonna come down to how much influence

2210
02:20:35,175 --> 02:20:37,091
Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2211
02:20:38,341 --> 02:20:39,591
Did I say something funny?

2212
02:20:39,755 --> 02:20:44,175
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden", when we all know that it's Strauss.

2213
02:20:44,633 --> 02:20:46,591
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.

2214
02:20:47,258 --> 02:20:49,749
And then you humiliated him in front of Congress.

2215
02:20:49,829 --> 02:20:51,383
But more useful than a sandwich!

2216
02:20:55,383 --> 02:20:56,385
How'd I do?

2217
02:20:57,800 --> 02:20:59,216
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2218
02:20:59,883 --> 02:21:01,028
That was six years ago.

2219
02:21:01,175 --> 02:21:04,550
You know, they're truly vindictive, patient as saints.

2220
02:21:04,841 --> 02:21:07,258
Strauss has been perfectly clear that he is neutral.

2221
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:11,091
Wake up! It is Strauss!

2222
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:13,216
It's always been Strauss, and you know it!

2223
02:21:14,216 --> 02:21:15,550
Why won't you fight him?

2224
02:21:19,175 --> 02:21:22,781
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover, or one of Truman's guys.

2225
02:21:22,839 --> 02:21:23,839
It was you.

2226
02:21:24,332 --> 02:21:25,550
You gave the file to Borden.

2227
02:21:25,758 --> 02:21:27,216
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2228
02:21:27,383 --> 02:21:28,550
-You convinced him...
-Borden...

2229
02:21:29,966 --> 02:21:31,925
didn't take any convincing.

2230
02:21:32,342 --> 02:21:33,841
Take your time, use the entire file.

2231
02:21:34,216 --> 02:21:36,300
Write up your conclusions, send them to the FBI.

2232
02:21:36,633 --> 02:21:38,800
The material's obviously extensive,

2233
02:21:38,841 --> 02:21:40,883
but there's nothing new here.

2234
02:21:41,133 --> 02:21:42,258
Your conclusions will be.

2235
02:21:43,273 --> 02:21:44,591
And they'll have to be answered.

2236
02:21:45,466 --> 02:21:46,966
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2237
02:21:47,425 --> 02:21:50,008
Oppenheimer's too slippery for that self-promoting clown.

2238
02:21:50,633 --> 02:21:51,758
I've talked it over with Hoover.

2239
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:55,216
He'll hold McCarthy at bay while you do this with the AEC.

2240
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:57,675
-Trial?
-No, no trial.

2241
02:21:57,716 --> 02:22:00,216
You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.

2242
02:22:00,675 --> 02:22:01,716
You can't martyr him.

2243
02:22:02,701 --> 02:22:05,883
We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility,

2244
02:22:05,925 --> 02:22:09,133
so he can never again speak on matters of national security.

2245
02:22:10,341 --> 02:22:11,343
Then what?

2246
02:22:12,841 --> 02:22:15,883
A shabby little room. Far from the limelight.

2247
02:22:21,925 --> 02:22:26,050
A simple bureaucratic procedure. His Q clearance. It's up for renewal.

2248
02:22:26,425 --> 02:22:29,008
You send your accusations to the FBI...

2249
02:22:31,508 --> 02:22:34,466
Hoover sends them to the AEC. You're forced to act.

2250
02:22:35,216 --> 02:22:36,508
You write up an indictment.

2251
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:40,300
You tell Oppenheimer his security clearance is not being renewed.

2252
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:42,716
But offer him the chance to appeal.

2253
02:22:42,883 --> 02:22:44,966
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2254
02:22:45,341 --> 02:22:46,841
-May I keep this?
-No.

2255
02:22:47,716 --> 02:22:51,216
If you do decide to appeal, they'll have to send you a copy.

2256
02:22:51,758 --> 02:22:56,300
When he appeals, and trust me, he will, I appoint a board.

2257
02:22:57,300 --> 02:22:59,050
They will, of course, have counsel.

2258
02:23:00,008 --> 02:23:01,591
-Prosecutor?
-In all but name.

2259
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,758
-Who?
-Roger Robb.

2260
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:04,798
Ouch.

2261
02:23:04,841 --> 02:23:08,091
Robb will have security clearance to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2262
02:23:08,216 --> 02:23:10,758
As will the Gray Board. Defense counsel will not.

2263
02:23:12,466 --> 02:23:13,466
A closed hearing.

2264
02:23:13,716 --> 02:23:17,800
The so-called interrogatory information in your indictment of me...

2265
02:23:17,841 --> 02:23:21,466
No audience, no reporters, no burden of proof.

2266
02:23:21,966 --> 02:23:22,967
No burden of proof?

2267
02:23:24,966 --> 02:23:25,966
We're not convicting.

2268
02:23:27,133 --> 02:23:28,675
We're just denying.

2269
02:23:34,591 --> 02:23:36,508
What is it you said?

2270
02:23:37,508 --> 02:23:40,675
This is just how the game is played.

2271
02:23:41,508 --> 02:23:42,925
Well, forgive my naivete.

2272
02:23:43,841 --> 02:23:47,341
Amateurs seek the sun, get eaten.

2273
02:23:48,883 --> 02:23:51,925
Power stays in the shadows.

2274
02:23:52,216 --> 02:23:55,133
But, sir, you're... you're out of the shadows now.

2275
02:23:55,175 --> 02:23:56,966
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

2276
02:23:57,133 --> 02:23:58,119
Well...

2277
02:24:00,061 --> 02:24:01,758
Teller's testifying this morning.

2278
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,258
That'll help. And then...

2279
02:24:04,647 --> 02:24:05,947
Hill is in the afternoon.

2280
02:24:05,972 --> 02:24:07,216
Hill is gonna help us too.

2281
02:24:10,591 --> 02:24:12,925
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2282
02:24:13,841 --> 02:24:15,133
-May I keep this?
-No.

2283
02:24:17,966 --> 02:24:22,383
If you do decide to appeal, then they'll have to send you a copy.

2284
02:24:26,425 --> 02:24:28,341
Take my car and driver, I insist.

2285
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,175
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.

2286
02:24:35,383 --> 02:24:38,050
Of course. But don't take too long.

2287
02:24:38,216 --> 02:24:39,716
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2288
02:24:46,383 --> 02:24:48,193
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

2289
02:24:48,758 --> 02:24:49,759
I think it's wrong.

2290
02:25:03,258 --> 02:25:06,216
Nichols wants me to fight, so he can get it all on the record.

2291
02:25:06,797 --> 02:25:08,175
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2292
02:25:08,617 --> 02:25:13,071
Strauss knows that you can't do that. You'd be accepting the charges.

2293
02:25:13,967 --> 02:25:15,175
You'll lose your job.

2294
02:25:15,508 --> 02:25:18,258
You will lose your reputation. We'll lose our house.

2295
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:19,800
Robert, we have to fight.

2296
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:25,341
As AEC counsel, I can't represent you.

2297
02:25:25,925 --> 02:25:27,050
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2298
02:25:27,675 --> 02:25:28,676
Oh, he's good.

2299
02:25:28,925 --> 02:25:31,925
The best, but I have to warn you.

2300
02:25:33,716 --> 02:25:34,925
This won't be a fair fight.

2301
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:39,758
During your interview with Boris Pash in 1943, did you refer to microfilm?

2302
02:25:40,008 --> 02:25:43,216
-No.
-Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

2303
02:25:43,258 --> 02:25:46,675
You never said, "man of the consulate, expert in the use of microfilm"?

2304
02:25:46,716 --> 02:25:47,716
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
-No.

2305
02:25:47,758 --> 02:25:50,133
I would like to know what document Mr. Robb is quoting from,

2306
02:25:50,175 --> 02:25:51,616
and if we might be furnished with a copy.

2307
02:25:52,008 --> 02:25:53,841
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

2308
02:25:54,008 --> 02:25:56,258
I think we should get back to firsthand information.

2309
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:57,300
This is firsthand.

2310
02:25:57,758 --> 02:25:58,772
How so, Roger?

2311
02:26:00,925 --> 02:26:02,258
There was a recording of the interview.

2312
02:26:07,341 --> 02:26:10,175
You let my client sit here and potentially perjure himself,

2313
02:26:10,216 --> 02:26:12,383
and all this time, you had a recording?

2314
02:26:12,633 --> 02:26:15,466
Nobody told your client to misrepresent his former answers.

2315
02:26:15,508 --> 02:26:17,216
Misrepresent? It was 12 years ago!

2316
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:18,817
Can we hear this recording?

2317
02:26:19,050 --> 02:26:20,302
You don't have the clearance, Mr. Garrison.

2318
02:26:20,349 --> 02:26:22,175
But you're reading it into the record!

2319
02:26:22,591 --> 02:26:26,883
Please, please. Is this proceeding interested in entrapment or in truth?

2320
02:26:27,383 --> 02:26:31,341
If it's truth, where's the disclosure? Where's the witness list?

2321
02:26:31,383 --> 02:26:34,216
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a trial, as you are well aware.

2322
02:26:34,258 --> 02:26:38,091
Evidentiary rules do not apply. We are dealing with national security.

2323
02:26:38,216 --> 02:26:39,425
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2324
02:26:39,466 --> 02:26:43,675
I fail to see how national security prevents the prosecution from

2325
02:26:43,716 --> 02:26:45,883
providing us with a list of witnesses!
-Perhaps we are in need

2326
02:26:45,925 --> 02:26:48,216
of a brief recess.
-Gentlemen. You have my words.

2327
02:26:48,258 --> 02:26:51,091
If you say they're from a transcript, then I'll accept it.

2328
02:26:51,133 --> 02:26:53,841
I've already explained I made up a cock-and-bull story.

2329
02:26:54,008 --> 02:26:57,050
And why would anyone make up such an elaborate story?

2330
02:26:57,091 --> 02:26:58,300
Because I was an idiot.

2331
02:26:59,550 --> 02:27:00,551
Why lie?

2332
02:27:00,716 --> 02:27:04,872
Well, clearly with the intention of not revealing who the intermediary was.

2333
02:27:05,008 --> 02:27:07,341
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier, the communist.

2334
02:27:07,966 --> 02:27:08,970
Is he still your friend?

2335
02:27:09,883 --> 02:27:10,893
Yes.

2336
02:27:14,300 --> 02:27:16,008
Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

2337
02:27:16,419 --> 02:27:18,216
You know who else the prosecution has called?

2338
02:27:18,466 --> 02:27:22,466
Teller, obviously. They've asked Lawrence.

2339
02:27:22,883 --> 02:27:25,133
-What did he say?
-He wasn't going to help them,

2340
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:26,883
but...
-But?

2341
02:27:27,747 --> 02:27:32,008
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman had been having an affair for years.

2342
02:27:32,341 --> 02:27:34,175
The whole time you lived with them in Pasadena.

2343
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:38,175
He convinced Lawrence that Richard died of a broken heart.

2344
02:27:38,216 --> 02:27:40,086
-That's absurd.
-What part?

2345
02:27:40,175 --> 02:27:43,216
A broken heart. Richard never found out.

2346
02:27:44,425 --> 02:27:45,633
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2347
02:27:46,216 --> 02:27:47,219
I don't know.

2348
02:27:48,091 --> 02:27:52,175
Dr. Rabi, what governmental positions do you currently hold?

2349
02:27:52,716 --> 02:27:55,633
I am the chairman of the general advisory committee

2350
02:27:55,675 --> 02:27:57,966
to the AEC, succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2351
02:27:58,550 --> 02:28:00,466
And how long have you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2352
02:28:01,466 --> 02:28:05,300
Since 1928. I... I know him quite well.

2353
02:28:05,628 --> 02:28:09,175
Well enough to speak to the bearing of his loyalty and character?

2354
02:28:09,862 --> 02:28:13,091
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character.

2355
02:28:13,966 --> 02:28:17,383
And he is loyal to the United States, to his friends,

2356
02:28:17,841 --> 02:28:19,716
to the institutions of which he is part.

2357
02:28:21,841 --> 02:28:22,841
Eat.

2358
02:28:42,258 --> 02:28:43,258
Who was that?

2359
02:28:43,466 --> 02:28:44,466
Nothing to worry about.

2360
02:28:48,133 --> 02:28:49,633
After the Russian A-bomb test,

2361
02:28:49,675 --> 02:28:52,091
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you about the hydrogen bomb?

2362
02:28:52,350 --> 02:28:53,883
You'd be better off asking him.

2363
02:28:54,175 --> 02:28:55,216
Well, I fully intend to.

2364
02:28:56,388 --> 02:29:00,008
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2365
02:29:00,383 --> 02:29:03,383
No, he, he thought that a fusion program

2366
02:29:03,425 --> 02:29:06,216
would come at the expense of our awfully good fission program.

2367
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:07,883
But that proved not to be the case.

2368
02:29:08,425 --> 02:29:09,883
In the event, both could be done.

2369
02:29:10,383 --> 02:29:13,008
Suppose that this board did not feel satisfied

2370
02:29:13,050 --> 02:29:16,501
that in his testimony here Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful,

2371
02:29:17,216 --> 02:29:19,091
what would you say whether or not he should be cleared?

2372
02:29:19,383 --> 02:29:21,633
Why go through all this against a man

2373
02:29:21,675 --> 02:29:23,758
who has accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2374
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:24,883
Look at his record.

2375
02:29:25,550 --> 02:29:27,800
We have an A-bomb, and a whole series of it.

2376
02:29:27,925 --> 02:29:30,466
We have a whole series of super bombs. What more do you want?

2377
02:29:31,470 --> 02:29:32,470
Mermaids?

2378
02:29:33,091 --> 02:29:35,925
But I've known Secretary Strauss for many years.

2379
02:29:36,282 --> 02:29:39,425
And I feel it a necessity to express the warm support

2380
02:29:39,974 --> 02:29:42,341
for science and scientists Lewis has shown.

2381
02:29:42,591 --> 02:29:43,592
We'll break now.

2382
02:29:44,008 --> 02:29:47,966
-Unless there's any immediate business.
-Senator, I'd like to once again request

2383
02:29:48,466 --> 02:29:51,050
that we're furnished with a list of witnesses.

2384
02:29:51,216 --> 02:29:52,758
And I will remind the nominee

2385
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:55,489
that we don't always have that information in advance.

2386
02:29:55,758 --> 02:29:58,133
We do know that Dr. Hill will be here after lunch.

2387
02:29:58,646 --> 02:30:01,508
Mr. Chairman, our next scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

2388
02:30:01,591 --> 02:30:04,300
has apparently come down with colitis.

2389
02:30:07,675 --> 02:30:09,912
So we'll proceed with William Borden instead.

2390
02:30:10,966 --> 02:30:13,300
Mr. Borden, welcome. Please take a seat.

2391
02:30:15,133 --> 02:30:16,135
Mr. Borden,

2392
02:30:17,471 --> 02:30:20,091
during your investigation into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2393
02:30:20,133 --> 02:30:21,800
did you reach certain conclusions?

2394
02:30:22,383 --> 02:30:24,133
-I did.
-And did there come a time

2395
02:30:24,175 --> 02:30:27,341
when you expressed those conclusions in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover,

2396
02:30:27,508 --> 02:30:30,300
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
-That is correct.

2397
02:30:30,341 --> 02:30:32,966
Prior to the writing of the letter, did you discuss the writing of the letter

2398
02:30:33,008 --> 02:30:35,216
with anybody attached to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2399
02:30:35,758 --> 02:30:36,883
-I did not.
-Excellent.

2400
02:30:36,925 --> 02:30:38,841
-Do you have a copy of the letter?
-I have one in front of me.

2401
02:30:38,916 --> 02:30:41,050
Would you please be so kind as to read it, sir?

2402
02:30:42,341 --> 02:30:44,758
"Dear Mr. Hoover, the purpose of this letter

2403
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:47,133
-"is to state..."
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have...

2404
02:30:47,758 --> 02:30:50,508
What is the purpose of the delay? He's simply going to read the letter.

2405
02:30:51,758 --> 02:30:54,050
Mr. Chairman, this is the first I've seen of this letter.

2406
02:30:54,508 --> 02:30:57,423
And I see statements here, at least one,

2407
02:30:57,447 --> 02:30:59,883
of a kind that I don't think anyone would like to see go into the record.

2408
02:30:59,925 --> 02:31:02,341
These are accusations that have not previously been made,

2409
02:31:02,633 --> 02:31:04,466
that are not part of the indictment from Nichols.

2410
02:31:04,508 --> 02:31:07,050
Accusations of a kind that I don't think belong here.

2411
02:31:07,091 --> 02:31:09,216
The witness wrote this letter on his own initiative,

2412
02:31:09,258 --> 02:31:11,508
laying out evidence that has already been before the board.

2413
02:31:11,716 --> 02:31:13,341
His conclusions are valid testimony,

2414
02:31:13,383 --> 02:31:16,633
just like the positive conclusions of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2415
02:31:16,675 --> 02:31:17,800
It cuts both ways.

2416
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:20,550
How long has counsel been in possession of this letter?

2417
02:31:20,706 --> 02:31:24,133
I don't think I should be subject to cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

2418
02:31:24,175 --> 02:31:27,300
Mr. Garrison, given that we on the board have all read the letter,

2419
02:31:27,341 --> 02:31:29,008
wouldn't it be better to have it in the record?

2420
02:31:30,466 --> 02:31:31,467
Let's proceed.

2421
02:31:33,591 --> 02:31:34,633
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2422
02:31:35,591 --> 02:31:38,008
"the purpose of this letter is to state my opinion,

2423
02:31:38,398 --> 02:31:41,851
"based upon years of study of the available classified evidence,

2424
02:31:42,675 --> 02:31:44,341
"that, more probably than not,

2425
02:31:44,758 --> 02:31:48,716
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.

2426
02:31:49,577 --> 02:31:51,716
"The following conclusions are justified.

2427
02:31:52,133 --> 02:31:56,508
"One, between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not,

2428
02:31:56,656 --> 02:32:00,175
"J. Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened communist

2429
02:32:00,383 --> 02:32:02,633
"that he volunteered information to the Soviets.

2430
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:05,258
"Two, more probably than not,

2431
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:08,716
"he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.

2432
02:32:09,675 --> 02:32:10,659
"Three.

2433
02:32:10,966 --> 02:32:14,925
"More probably than not, he has since acted under a Soviet directive

2434
02:32:14,966 --> 02:32:17,758
"in influencing United States military policy."

2435
02:32:17,809 --> 02:32:20,091
-I'm sorry, Robert.
-"Atomic energy, intelligence and..."

2436
02:32:20,216 --> 02:32:24,591
Is anyone ever going to tell the truth about what's happening here?

2437
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:27,841
We will now hear from Dr. David Hill.

2438
02:32:38,216 --> 02:32:41,050
Dr. Hill, would you care to make a statement?

2439
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:44,314
Thank you.

2440
02:32:44,571 --> 02:32:48,258
I've been asked to testify about Lewis Strauss,

2441
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:53,425
a man who has given years of service in high positions of government,

2442
02:32:53,591 --> 02:32:58,091
and who is known to be earnest, hard-working, and intelligent.

2443
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:01,591
The views I have to express are my own,

2444
02:33:02,258 --> 02:33:05,508
but I believe that much I have to say will help to indicate why

2445
02:33:06,675 --> 02:33:10,550
most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

2446
02:33:11,574 --> 02:33:13,425
completely out of government.

2447
02:33:15,410 --> 02:33:19,508
You're referring to the hostility of certain scientists,

2448
02:33:19,633 --> 02:33:23,383
directed toward Mr. Strauss, because of his commitment to security,

2449
02:33:23,425 --> 02:33:25,966
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

2450
02:33:28,966 --> 02:33:29,982
No.

2451
02:33:30,216 --> 02:33:35,008
Because of the personal vindictiveness he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2452
02:33:37,050 --> 02:33:39,841
Order! Order!

2453
02:33:40,258 --> 02:33:43,466
It appears to most scientists around this country

2454
02:33:44,942 --> 02:33:47,883
that Robert Oppenheimer is now being pilloried,

2455
02:33:47,925 --> 02:33:51,966
and put through an ordeal, because he expressed his honest opinions.

2456
02:33:52,716 --> 02:33:55,883
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing a service to my country

2457
02:33:55,925 --> 02:33:59,258
when hearing this case.
-No board, in this country,

2458
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,591
should sit in judgment of a man because he expressed his strong opinions.

2459
02:34:03,925 --> 02:34:06,216
If you want to try that case, you should try me.

2460
02:34:07,216 --> 02:34:09,841
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I've... become stirred.

2461
02:34:11,091 --> 02:34:12,089
But I am.

2462
02:34:12,477 --> 02:34:16,550
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

2463
02:34:16,591 --> 02:34:19,591
or participate in the hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2464
02:34:19,633 --> 02:34:21,341
The Oppenheimer matter was...

2465
02:34:22,216 --> 02:34:26,883
initiated, and carried through, largely through the animus of Lewis Strauss.

2466
02:34:28,425 --> 02:34:31,296
Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of Strauss's position

2467
02:34:31,343 --> 02:34:33,440
on the shipments of isotopes to Norway,

2468
02:34:33,503 --> 02:34:36,675
and Strauss never forgave him this public humiliation.

2469
02:34:37,591 --> 02:34:41,008
Another controversy between them centered around their differences in judgment

2470
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:43,994
on how the H-bomb would contribute to national security.

2471
02:34:44,283 --> 02:34:47,550
Strauss turned to the personnel security system in order to

2472
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:50,175
destroy Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

2473
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:53,091
and Strauss was able to find a few ambitious men

2474
02:34:53,550 --> 02:34:57,175
who also disagreed with Oppenheimer's positions and envied him

2475
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:59,300
his prestige in government circles.

2476
02:34:59,675 --> 02:35:03,550
I've always assumed, and still assume, that he is loyal to the United States.

2477
02:35:04,341 --> 02:35:06,063
I believe this, and I shall believe it,

2478
02:35:06,087 --> 02:35:08,299
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2479
02:35:08,925 --> 02:35:12,633
Do you or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2480
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:19,927
In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act in a way

2481
02:35:19,987 --> 02:35:23,008
which was, to me, exceedingly hard to understand.

2482
02:35:23,369 --> 02:35:25,689
I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues,

2483
02:35:25,925 --> 02:35:29,216
and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated.

2484
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:33,947
To this extent, I feel I want to see the vital interests of this country

2485
02:35:34,258 --> 02:35:37,925
in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more.

2486
02:35:39,133 --> 02:35:40,408
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

2487
02:35:44,661 --> 02:35:45,676
I'm sorry.

2488
02:35:48,466 --> 02:35:50,383
You shook his fucking hand!?

2489
02:35:51,675 --> 02:35:53,550
Oh, I would have spit in his face.

2490
02:35:53,591 --> 02:35:55,685
I'm not sure the Board would have appreciated that.

2491
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:57,341
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?

2492
02:35:57,383 --> 02:36:00,216
Well, I think you're all being too goddamn gentlemanly.

2493
02:36:00,286 --> 02:36:04,091
Gray must see what Robb is doing. Why doesn't he just shut him down?

2494
02:36:04,364 --> 02:36:06,425
And you, shaking Teller's hand.

2495
02:36:06,685 --> 02:36:09,716
You need to stop playing the martyr.

2496
02:36:10,925 --> 02:36:15,278
Under the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2497
02:36:21,675 --> 02:36:26,258
Under my interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act,

2498
02:36:26,300 --> 02:36:30,675
which did not exist when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2499
02:36:32,216 --> 02:36:37,300
I would not clear him today if I were on the commission.

2500
02:36:37,925 --> 02:36:39,285
Good. Thank you, General. That is all.

2501
02:36:39,355 --> 02:36:41,175
But I don't think I'd clear any of those guys.

2502
02:36:41,972 --> 02:36:42,968
That's all.

2503
02:36:46,050 --> 02:36:48,816
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility in the selection

2504
02:36:48,863 --> 02:36:50,753
or the clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

2505
02:36:50,925 --> 02:36:52,008
No. None at all.

2506
02:36:52,300 --> 02:36:55,633
And you wouldn't want to leave this board with any suggestion today that

2507
02:36:55,807 --> 02:36:58,595
you're here questioning his basic loyalty to the United States

2508
02:36:58,619 --> 02:37:00,097
in the operation of Los Alamos?

2509
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:04,509
By no means. I hope I didn't lead anyone to believe otherwise for an instant.

2510
02:37:05,883 --> 02:37:06,893
Thank you, General.

2511
02:37:24,550 --> 02:37:27,466
-Okay. We shouldn't keep them waiting.
-She'll be here.

2512
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:29,966
Do you even want her here?

2513
02:37:30,175 --> 02:37:32,633
Only a fool or an adolescent presumes

2514
02:37:32,675 --> 02:37:36,175
to know someone else's relationship, and you're neither, Lloyd.

2515
02:37:38,966 --> 02:37:41,466
Kitty and I are grown-ups.

2516
02:37:42,758 --> 02:37:44,341
We've walked through fire together.

2517
02:37:45,341 --> 02:37:46,341
She'll do fine.

2518
02:37:47,716 --> 02:37:51,334
Would you describe your views on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

2519
02:37:51,633 --> 02:37:52,758
Very strongly against.

2520
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:55,425
I've had nothing to do with communism in, since...

2521
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:57,508
since 1936. Since...

2522
02:37:58,758 --> 02:38:00,175
Since before I met Robert.

2523
02:38:02,287 --> 02:38:03,303
That's all.

2524
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:07,258
The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer was not interrogated

2525
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:10,313
by impartial and disinterested counsel for the Gray Board.

2526
02:38:10,633 --> 02:38:12,905
He was interrogated by a prosecutor who used

2527
02:38:12,930 --> 02:38:15,466
all the tricks of a rather ingenious legal background.

2528
02:38:15,562 --> 02:38:19,800
You are charging now that the Gray Board permitted a prosecution.

2529
02:38:20,508 --> 02:38:21,675
If I were on the Gray Board,

2530
02:38:22,591 --> 02:38:24,675
I would have protested against the tactics

2531
02:38:24,716 --> 02:38:27,508
of the man who served in fact as the prosecuting counsel.

2532
02:38:27,591 --> 02:38:29,258
A man appointed not by the Board,

2533
02:38:30,649 --> 02:38:32,208
but by Lewis Strauss.

2534
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:35,801
Who was this?

2535
02:38:37,383 --> 02:38:38,395
I'm sorry?

2536
02:38:39,133 --> 02:38:40,133
Who was this?

2537
02:38:40,675 --> 02:38:41,675
罗杰・罗伯
Roger Robb.

2538
02:38:42,341 --> 02:38:43,466
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2539
02:38:48,287 --> 02:38:50,258
Did you have a Communist Party membership card?

2540
02:38:52,175 --> 02:38:54,349
I'm... I'm not sure.

2541
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:55,592
Not sure?

2542
02:38:58,383 --> 02:38:59,373
Well...

2543
02:39:03,050 --> 02:39:04,058
Well?

2544
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:15,383
I mean, presumably, the act of joining the party

2545
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:18,758
required sending some money and receiving a card, no?

2546
02:39:29,091 --> 02:39:30,093
Sorry.

2547
02:39:31,216 --> 02:39:32,230
Yes.

2548
02:39:34,716 --> 02:39:38,175
It's just, it was all so very long ago, Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

2549
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:39,747
-Not really.
-Long enough to have forgotten.

2550
02:39:39,786 --> 02:39:42,883
-Did you return the card, or rip it up?
-The card whose existence I've forgotten?

2551
02:39:42,925 --> 02:39:45,758
-Your Communist Party membership card?
-Haven't the slightest idea.

2552
02:39:49,091 --> 02:39:52,925
Can a distinction be made between Soviet communism and communism?

2553
02:39:53,591 --> 02:39:54,841
Well, in the days when I was a member,

2554
02:39:54,883 --> 02:39:56,800
-I thought they were definitely two things.
-Oh?

2555
02:39:56,883 --> 02:39:59,633
I thought that the Communist Party of the United States

2556
02:39:59,675 --> 02:40:03,258
was concerned with our domestic problems. I now no longer believe this.

2557
02:40:03,383 --> 02:40:05,841
I believe the whole thing's linked together and spread all over the world,

2558
02:40:05,883 --> 02:40:09,758
and I have believed this since I left the party 16 years ago.

2559
02:40:09,883 --> 02:40:12,258
-But...
-17 years ago. My mistake.

2560
02:40:12,758 --> 02:40:14,679
-But you...
-Sorry, 18.

2561
02:40:15,633 --> 02:40:16,780
18 years ago.

2562
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:20,925
Are you familiar with the fact your husband was making contributions

2563
02:40:20,966 --> 02:40:23,591
to the Spanish Civil War as late as 1942?

2564
02:40:23,633 --> 02:40:25,800
I knew that Robert gave money from time to time.

2565
02:40:25,841 --> 02:40:28,466
Did you know this money was going into Communist Party channels?

2566
02:40:28,550 --> 02:40:30,425
-Don't you mean through?
-Pardon?

2567
02:40:30,466 --> 02:40:33,300
I think you mean through Communist Party channels, don't you?

2568
02:40:33,716 --> 02:40:34,700
-Yes.
-Yes?

2569
02:40:34,876 --> 02:40:36,716
-Yes.
-Yes.

2570
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:40,026
Then would it be fair to say that this meant that by 1942,

2571
02:40:40,057 --> 02:40:42,841
your husband had not stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party?

2572
02:40:44,258 --> 02:40:46,925
You don't have to answer that yes or no, you can answer that any way you wish.

2573
02:40:47,050 --> 02:40:49,841
I know that, thank you. It's your question.

2574
02:40:50,785 --> 02:40:52,091
It's not properly phrased.

2575
02:40:52,133 --> 02:40:53,899
-Do you understand what I'm getting at?
-I do.

2576
02:40:53,924 --> 02:40:56,422
-Then why don't you answer it that way?
-Because I don't like your phrase,

2577
02:40:56,925 --> 02:40:58,716
"having anything to do with the Communist Party,"

2578
02:40:58,758 --> 02:41:01,758
because Robert never had anything to do with the Communist Party as such.

2579
02:41:02,091 --> 02:41:04,383
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.

2580
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:07,675
I know he took an intellectual interest in communist ideas.

2581
02:41:07,716 --> 02:41:09,217
Are there two types of communists?

2582
02:41:09,591 --> 02:41:12,008
Intellectual communists, and your plain old regular commie?

2583
02:41:13,550 --> 02:41:15,121
Well, I couldn't answer that one.

2584
02:41:16,383 --> 02:41:17,370
I couldn't either.

2585
02:41:24,675 --> 02:41:25,659
Good evening.

2586
02:41:26,008 --> 02:41:27,341
Robert, you can't win this thing.

2587
02:41:27,550 --> 02:41:29,800
It's a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome.

2588
02:41:29,841 --> 02:41:31,175
Why put yourself through more of it?

2589
02:41:32,216 --> 02:41:33,550
I have my reasons.

2590
02:41:35,258 --> 02:41:36,259
Alright.

2591
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:37,820
Good night.

2592
02:41:42,508 --> 02:41:43,591
He has a point.

2593
02:41:45,133 --> 02:41:47,425
-I'm not sure you understand, Albert.
-No?

2594
02:41:48,621 --> 02:41:50,883
I left my country, never to return.

2595
02:41:52,148 --> 02:41:53,758
You served your country well.

2596
02:41:54,591 --> 02:41:56,966
If this is the reward she offers you, then...

2597
02:41:58,155 --> 02:42:00,175
perhaps you should turn your back on her.

2598
02:42:01,508 --> 02:42:03,258
Damn it, I happen to love this country.

2599
02:42:04,341 --> 02:42:06,050
Then tell them to go to hell.

2600
02:42:06,925 --> 02:42:10,466
Interestingly enough, this is no longer a confirmation hearing.

2601
02:42:10,770 --> 02:42:12,133
It's now a trial...

2602
02:42:12,766 --> 02:42:13,966
about a trial!

2603
02:42:14,175 --> 02:42:15,174
For god's sakes!

2604
02:42:15,591 --> 02:42:18,300
It's not good he's telling everyone you initiated the hearings.

2605
02:42:18,341 --> 02:42:20,425
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

2606
02:42:20,466 --> 02:42:23,925
He certainly can't prove that I gave the file to Borden.

2607
02:42:24,008 --> 02:42:26,550
We're not in court, sir. There's no burden of proof.

2608
02:42:27,175 --> 02:42:28,633
Right, they're not convicting.

2609
02:42:29,966 --> 02:42:31,216
They're just denying.

2610
02:42:31,841 --> 02:42:34,633
Why would Hill come here to tear me down? What's his angle?

2611
02:42:34,799 --> 02:42:36,758
Do people need a reason to do the right thing?

2612
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:39,383
-As he sees it.
-I told you.

2613
02:42:39,508 --> 02:42:41,920
Oppenheimer's been poisoning the scientists against me

2614
02:42:41,944 --> 02:42:43,550
right from that first meeting.

2615
02:42:43,716 --> 02:42:46,463
I don't know what Oppenheimer said to him that day,

2616
02:42:46,518 --> 02:42:49,236
but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.

2617
02:42:51,133 --> 02:42:53,050
Oppenheimer knows how to manipulate his own.

2618
02:42:53,675 --> 02:42:54,716
At Los Alamos,

2619
02:42:55,258 --> 02:42:57,550
he preyed on the naivete of scientists

2620
02:42:57,591 --> 02:42:59,716
who thought they get a say in how we use their work.

2621
02:43:00,008 --> 02:43:02,175
They'll never think he was that naive himself.

2622
02:43:02,883 --> 02:43:06,008
Doctor, during your work on the hydrogen bomb,

2623
02:43:06,282 --> 02:43:08,883
were you... deterred by any moral qualms?

2624
02:43:09,866 --> 02:43:10,883
Yes, of course.

2625
02:43:11,341 --> 02:43:13,090
But you still got on with your work, didn't you?

2626
02:43:13,157 --> 02:43:15,216
Yes, because this was work of exploration,

2627
02:43:15,258 --> 02:43:17,300
it was not the preparation of a weapon.

2628
02:43:17,591 --> 02:43:19,513
You mean it was more of an academic excursion?

2629
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:22,883
No, it is not an academic thing, whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

2630
02:43:22,925 --> 02:43:24,133
It's a matter of life and death.

2631
02:43:24,175 --> 02:43:26,425
By 1942, you were actively pushing the development

2632
02:43:26,466 --> 02:43:27,466
of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

2633
02:43:27,508 --> 02:43:28,800
Pushing is not the right word.

2634
02:43:28,883 --> 02:43:30,758
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

2635
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:33,133
So when did these moral qualms become so strong

2636
02:43:33,195 --> 02:43:36,341
that you actively opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb?

2637
02:43:36,508 --> 02:43:39,175
When it was suggested that it be the policy of the United States

2638
02:43:39,216 --> 02:43:40,841
to make these things at all costs,

2639
02:43:40,883 --> 02:43:43,175
without regard to the balance between these weapons

2640
02:43:43,341 --> 02:43:45,466
and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2641
02:43:47,216 --> 02:43:49,273
What do moral qualms have to do with that?

2642
02:43:50,675 --> 02:43:52,633
-What do moral qualms have to do with it?
-Yes.

2643
02:43:52,716 --> 02:43:55,050
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

2644
02:43:55,091 --> 02:43:56,925
He wanted to be The Man Who Moved the Earth.

2645
02:43:56,966 --> 02:44:01,200
He talks about putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle.

2646
02:44:01,508 --> 02:44:03,458
Well, I'm here to tell you that I know,

2647
02:44:03,966 --> 02:44:08,300
J. Robert Oppenheimer, if he could do it all over, he'd do it all the same.

2648
02:44:08,505 --> 02:44:11,883
You know he's never once said that he regrets Hiroshima?

2649
02:44:12,175 --> 02:44:14,216
He'd do it all over. Why?

2650
02:44:14,886 --> 02:44:19,050
Because it made him the most important man who ever lived.

2651
02:44:20,050 --> 02:44:22,714
We freely used the atomic bomb.

2652
02:44:22,758 --> 02:44:24,966
In fact, Doctor, you assisted in selecting the target

2653
02:44:25,008 --> 02:44:26,841
to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, didn't you?

2654
02:44:27,675 --> 02:44:29,202
-Yes...
-Well then, you knew, did you not,

2655
02:44:29,226 --> 02:44:31,675
that by dropping that atomic bomb on the target you selected,

2656
02:44:31,716 --> 02:44:34,341
that thousands of civilians would be killed or injured. Is that correct?

2657
02:44:34,967 --> 02:44:36,758
Yes, not as many as turned out.

2658
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:39,217
Oh. Then how many were killed or injured?

2659
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:42,253
-70,000.
-70,000, both Hiroshima and...

2660
02:44:42,298 --> 02:44:45,133
-110,000 to both.
-On the day of each bombing?

2661
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:47,862
-Yes.
-Yes.

2662
02:44:47,883 --> 02:44:49,298
And in the weeks and years that followed?

2663
02:44:49,342 --> 02:44:52,491
It has been put at somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000.

2664
02:44:52,528 --> 02:44:54,157
220,000 dead, at least.

2665
02:44:54,239 --> 02:44:56,199
-Yes.
-Any moral scruples about that?

2666
02:44:58,241 --> 02:44:59,248
Terrible ones.

2667
02:44:59,282 --> 02:45:02,949
But yet you testified in here that the bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.

2668
02:45:03,342 --> 02:45:06,257
-Technically successful.
-Oh! Technically it was very successful.

2669
02:45:06,317 --> 02:45:08,677
And it is also alleged to have helped to end the war.

2670
02:45:08,718 --> 02:45:11,635
Would you have been supportive of the dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

2671
02:45:12,052 --> 02:45:13,427
That would make no sense at all.

2672
02:45:13,593 --> 02:45:16,253
-Why?
-The target is too small.

2673
02:45:16,308 --> 02:45:18,297
Well, supposing there had been a target in Japan

2674
02:45:18,321 --> 02:45:20,082
big enough for a thermonuclear weapon,

2675
02:45:20,121 --> 02:45:21,593
would you have been opposed to the dropping of it?

2676
02:45:21,635 --> 02:45:23,591
This was not a problem with which I was confronted.

2677
02:45:23,593 --> 02:45:25,218
Well, I'm confronting you with it now, sir.

2678
02:45:25,343 --> 02:45:26,635
It was all part of his plan.

2679
02:45:26,843 --> 02:45:30,718
He wanted the glorious, insincere guilt of the self-important

2680
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:33,135
to wear like a fucking crown and say,

2681
02:45:33,177 --> 02:45:38,177
"No, we cannot go down this road," even as he knew we'd have to.

2682
02:45:38,510 --> 02:45:41,311
Would you have been opposed to the dropping of a thermonuclear weapon

2683
02:45:41,335 --> 02:45:44,040
on Japan because of moral scruples?
-Yes, I believe I would, sir.

2684
02:45:44,133 --> 02:45:46,427
Did you oppose the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima

2685
02:45:46,468 --> 02:45:47,549
because of moral scruples?

2686
02:45:47,650 --> 02:45:50,010
-We set forth our...
-No, you, you, you, you!

2687
02:45:50,052 --> 02:45:51,093
-I'm asking you...
-I set...

2688
02:45:51,135 --> 02:45:53,510
-You, you, you!
-I set forth our arguments

2689
02:45:53,552 --> 02:45:55,556
against dropping it, but I did not endorse them.

2690
02:45:55,802 --> 02:45:58,802
You mean after working night and day for three years building the bomb,

2691
02:45:58,968 --> 02:46:00,853
you then argued against the use of it?

2692
02:46:01,218 --> 02:46:04,927
I was asked by the Secretary of War what the views of scientists were.

2693
02:46:04,968 --> 02:46:07,427
I gave them the views against and the views for.

2694
02:46:07,468 --> 02:46:09,385
You supported the dropping of the atom bomb

2695
02:46:09,427 --> 02:46:10,635
on Japan, didn't you?
-What do you mean...

2696
02:46:10,677 --> 02:46:12,266
-You supported it...
-What do you mean, support?

2697
02:46:12,343 --> 02:46:13,893
Well, you helped pick the target, didn't you?

2698
02:46:13,924 --> 02:46:17,343
I did my job. I was not in a policy-making position at Los Alamos.

2699
02:46:17,427 --> 02:46:19,384
I would have done anything I was asked to do.

2700
02:46:19,432 --> 02:46:21,760
Well, then, you would have built the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2701
02:46:21,802 --> 02:46:24,066
-But I couldn't...
-I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

2702
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:28,510
And the GAC report, which you co-authored after the Soviet atomic test said:

2703
02:46:28,633 --> 02:46:31,593
"A super bomb should never be built!"

2704
02:46:31,675 --> 02:46:32,908
What we meant, what I meant...

2705
02:46:33,050 --> 02:46:34,550
-What you, who?
-Look, what I meant...

2706
02:46:34,592 --> 02:46:35,611
Who?

2707
02:46:36,758 --> 02:46:39,592
Well, wouldn't the Russians do anything to increase their strength?

2708
02:46:40,467 --> 02:46:42,508
If we did it, they would have to do it!

2709
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:44,633
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,

2710
02:46:44,675 --> 02:46:46,592
just as it had with the atomic bomb!

2711
02:46:46,842 --> 02:46:49,258
Just as it had with the atomic bomb, exactly!

2712
02:46:50,550 --> 02:46:54,550
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.

2713
02:46:59,050 --> 02:47:00,077
Dr. Oppenheimer...

2714
02:47:02,467 --> 02:47:06,842
when did your strong moral convictions develop with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

2715
02:47:14,926 --> 02:47:16,384
When it became clear to me

2716
02:47:18,051 --> 02:47:20,884
that we would tend to use any weapon we had.

2717
02:47:24,292 --> 02:47:28,926
J. Robert Oppenheimer the martyr, I gave him exactly what he wanted.

2718
02:47:29,717 --> 02:47:31,198
To be remembered for Trinity,

2719
02:47:31,349 --> 02:47:33,134
not Hiroshima!

2720
02:47:34,009 --> 02:47:36,009
Not Nagasaki!

2721
02:47:39,134 --> 02:47:40,634
He should be thanking me.

2722
02:47:41,967 --> 02:47:42,968
Well, he's not.

2723
02:47:46,551 --> 02:47:47,926
Do we still have enough votes?

2724
02:47:48,217 --> 02:47:50,032
Or is the crowning moment of my career

2725
02:47:50,056 --> 02:47:53,009
about to become the most public humiliation of my life?

2726
02:47:54,035 --> 02:47:55,467
Full Senate's about to vote.

2727
02:47:56,676 --> 02:47:57,656
You'll scrape through.

2728
02:47:57,713 --> 02:47:59,509
Great, then gather the fucking press.

2729
02:47:59,592 --> 02:48:02,221
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, this board,

2730
02:48:02,384 --> 02:48:04,426
having heard testimony from you

2731
02:48:04,467 --> 02:48:07,299
and many of your current and former colleagues,

2732
02:48:07,801 --> 02:48:11,634
has come to the unanimous conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.

2733
02:48:14,259 --> 02:48:15,273
However...

2734
02:48:16,092 --> 02:48:19,426
In the light of your continuing associations,

2735
02:48:19,467 --> 02:48:22,592
and disregard for the security apparatus of this country,

2736
02:48:23,051 --> 02:48:26,342
together with your somewhat disturbing conduct

2737
02:48:26,426 --> 02:48:28,092
on the hydrogen bomb program,

2738
02:48:28,759 --> 02:48:30,176
and the regrettable lack of candor

2739
02:48:30,217 --> 02:48:32,217
in certain of your responses to this board,

2740
02:48:33,259 --> 02:48:34,926
we have voted, two-to-one,

2741
02:48:36,092 --> 02:48:39,134
to deny the renewal of your security clearance.

2742
02:48:39,259 --> 02:48:42,295
A full written opinion, with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

2743
02:48:42,759 --> 02:48:45,301
will be issued to the AEC in the coming days.

2744
02:48:45,842 --> 02:48:46,842
That is all.

2745
02:48:57,802 --> 02:48:58,802
Robert.

2746
02:48:59,926 --> 02:49:00,926
Robert.

2747
02:49:04,092 --> 02:49:05,092
Don't...

2748
02:49:08,092 --> 02:49:09,259
Don't take in the sheets.

2749
02:49:15,326 --> 02:49:17,051
Two minutes. Two minutes!

2750
02:49:17,634 --> 02:49:18,759
You'll get your shot!

2751
02:49:22,759 --> 02:49:24,217
Is it official?

2752
02:49:26,176 --> 02:49:29,715
Well, there were a couple of unexpected holdouts.

2753
02:49:35,134 --> 02:49:37,051
I'm denied. Yeah?

2754
02:49:37,884 --> 02:49:39,383
-I'm afraid so, sir.
-Alright.

2755
02:49:47,301 --> 02:49:48,384
Who were the holdouts?

2756
02:49:48,585 --> 02:49:51,311
Um, there were three.

2757
02:49:51,444 --> 02:49:53,926
Led by the junior senator from Massachusetts.

2758
02:49:54,014 --> 02:49:55,634
Young guy trying to make a name for himself,

2759
02:49:55,676 --> 02:49:57,551
didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

2760
02:49:58,551 --> 02:49:59,536
What's his name?

2761
02:50:00,301 --> 02:50:01,842
Uh, Kennedy.

2762
02:50:02,277 --> 02:50:03,301
John F. Kennedy.

2763
02:50:07,357 --> 02:50:08,344
Kitty?

2764
02:50:14,801 --> 02:50:18,169
Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you,

2765
02:50:18,509 --> 02:50:20,134
then the world would forgive you?

2766
02:50:24,169 --> 02:50:25,169
It won't.

2767
02:50:27,941 --> 02:50:28,941
We'll see.

2768
02:50:43,566 --> 02:50:45,051
You told me I'd be okay.

2769
02:50:45,801 --> 02:50:47,870
Yeah, well, I didn't have all the facts, did I?

2770
02:50:48,009 --> 02:50:49,027
Here's a fact.

2771
02:50:49,217 --> 02:50:52,884
President Eisenhower pinned the Medal of Freedom on my chest last year,

2772
02:50:53,259 --> 02:50:55,467
because I've always done what's right for this country.

2773
02:50:55,759 --> 02:50:59,467
They don't want me in the cabinet room? Well, that's... that's fine.

2774
02:51:00,426 --> 02:51:02,592
Maybe they should just invite Oppenheimer instead.

2775
02:51:02,822 --> 02:51:03,842
Maybe they will.

2776
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:07,785
I told you. He turned the scientists against me,

2777
02:51:07,863 --> 02:51:09,884
one by one, starting with Einstein.

2778
02:51:09,926 --> 02:51:12,509
I told you about that. Einstein. Einstein by the pond.

2779
02:51:12,551 --> 02:51:14,908
You did, but you know, sir, since nobody...

2780
02:51:15,467 --> 02:51:17,842
really knows what they said to each other that day,

2781
02:51:17,884 --> 02:51:21,009
is it possible they didn't talk about you at all?

2782
02:51:21,676 --> 02:51:23,717
Is it possible they spoke about something, uh...

2783
02:51:24,884 --> 02:51:25,926
more important?

2784
02:51:41,259 --> 02:51:42,264
Thank you.

2785
02:51:42,801 --> 02:51:43,800
Albert.

2786
02:51:47,176 --> 02:51:48,509
The man of the moment.

2787
02:51:52,842 --> 02:51:57,004
You once held a reception for me in Berkeley.

2788
02:51:57,051 --> 02:51:59,068
-You gave me an award, hmm?
-Yes.

2789
02:52:00,509 --> 02:52:05,009
You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand what I'd started.

2790
02:52:05,951 --> 02:52:06,951
So...

2791
02:52:07,342 --> 02:52:11,264
The award really wasn't for me, it was for all of you, hmm?

2792
02:52:13,592 --> 02:52:15,301
Now it's your turn

2793
02:52:15,801 --> 02:52:19,884
to deal with the consequences of your achievement.

2794
02:52:21,426 --> 02:52:24,551
And one day, when they've punished you enough,

2795
02:52:27,009 --> 02:52:30,384
they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.

2796
02:52:35,051 --> 02:52:36,092
Make speeches.

2797
02:52:37,713 --> 02:52:38,842
Give you a medal.

2798
02:52:41,342 --> 02:52:42,362
Hello, Frank.

2799
02:52:43,010 --> 02:52:44,467
You're happy, I'm happy.

2800
02:52:51,343 --> 02:52:53,676
Pat you on the back, tell you all is forgiven.

2801
02:52:55,801 --> 02:52:56,926
Just remember...

2802
02:52:58,974 --> 02:53:00,592
it won't be for you.

2803
02:53:05,843 --> 02:53:06,967
It'll be for them.

2804
02:53:20,848 --> 02:53:21,848
Albert...

2805
02:53:24,093 --> 02:53:26,592
when I came to you with those calculations,

2806
02:53:27,301 --> 02:53:29,301
we thought we might start a chain reaction

2807
02:53:29,342 --> 02:53:32,426
that would destroy the entire world.

2808
02:53:34,259 --> 02:53:37,218
I remember it well. What of it?

2809
02:53:41,218 --> 02:53:42,300
I believe we did.
