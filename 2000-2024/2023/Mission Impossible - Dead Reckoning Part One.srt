<i>And we are impossible to find.</i>

21
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,720
Captain, we have a submerged
contact, designated Semyon-83,

22
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,523
exhibiting tonals of a US
Virginia-class submarine.

23
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,625
Bearing 130°, drawing forward.

24
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,263
Chief of the Watch, man
battle stations silently.

25
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:19,398
Wait for orders.

26
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,810
Officer of the
Deck, ship status?

27
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,101
Ship's depth, 50 meters.
Bottom, 72 meters.

28
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:25,504
Clearance to the ice
canopy, 21 meters.

29
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:27,538
Distance to deep

Come up easy on a standard bell.

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,182
Captain has the
conn. Helm, aye!

35
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:38,883
Coming to course 100°.

36
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,832
Steady on course 100°.

37
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,435
Weapons Officer, range?

38
00:02:56,567 --> 00:03:00,205
Firing solution is tracking at
a distance of 15,000 meters.

39
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:03,308
Sir, that doesn't make sense.
Tonals this loud and clear?

40
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:05,510
<i>He
must be closer than that.</i>

41
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,613
Captain, firing solution
just did a step change

42
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:11,016
to 10,000 meters.

43
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:12,750
Nothing moves that fast.

44
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:14,186
All solutions are matching.

45
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,520
The range is true.

46
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,556
Helm, right full
rudder to course 270°.

47
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:19,590
Course 270°, aye.

48
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,297
We'll just walk away
and head for deep water.

49
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,099
Contact bearing 160°.

50
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,633
Bearing rate zero?

51
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,603
He's there, turning
with us again.

52
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:34,839
He can see us.

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,075
Impossible. We're invisible.

54
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,245
Weapons, run diagnostics
on sonar and fire control.

55
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:41,513
<i>Something isn't right.</i>

56
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,181
Sir, he's flooding
his torpedo tubes!

00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,217
Torpedo room, conn.

58
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,319
<i>Load all torpedo
tubes.</i> Aye, sir.

59
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,591
Check clear! Forward clear!

60
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:55,360
Aft clear! Ram
torpedo! Ramming!

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,497
Torpedo tubes loaded.

62
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,132
He's opened outer doors!

63
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,167
Weapons, flood tubes one through
four and open outer doors.

64
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,135
Enter firing solution
into tube two.

65
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,837
Aye, Captain. Making tube
two ready in all respects.

66
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,339
Captain, he's provoking us.

67
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,741
He wants an excuse to
blow us out of the water.

68
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:13,110
Enemy torpedo in the
water, bearing 200°.

69
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,545
1,000 meters and accelerating.

70
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,466
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead flank cavitate.

71
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,905
My rudder is left full.

72
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,351
Answering all ahead
flank cavitate.

73
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:21,819
Launch countermeasures.
Launching countermeasures.

74
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,057
Fire tube two.

75
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:27,292
Firing tube two.

76
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,330
Our torpedo is
away. Running hot.

77
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,835
Enemy torpedo still
homing, range 800 meters.

78
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,304
He's blown through
our countermeasures.

79
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,339
Helm, right full
rudder. Right full.

80
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,108
Aye, sir! 600 meters.

81
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,243
Diving Officer, stand by to emergency
blow all main ballast tanks.

82
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,811
400 meters. Chief of the Watch,
stand by the collision alarm.

83
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,414
200 meters. This
is the captain.

84
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:52,350
All hands brace for impact.
Enemy torpedo impact in...

85
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,852
five... four...

86
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,923
three... two...

87
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,992
one. Impact!

88
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:13,004
What just happened?

89
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,339
It's, it's gone.

90
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:15,574
It missed us?

91
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,774
No.

92
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:19,978
It vanished like
it was never there.

93
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,614
Sonar, where is
the enemy vessel?

94
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:23,781
Bearing 330°,

95
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:25,450
4,000 meters off
our starboard bow.

96
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,152
Our torpedo is running true.

97
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,621
Impact with enemy
submarine in...

98
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:33,325
three... two... one.

99
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:38,862
Where was the impact?

100
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:41,666
Captain, enemy
submarine has vanished.

101
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,301
It's gone, sir.

102
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,469
I don't understand.

103
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,010
He was never there.

104
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,314
We've been chasing a phantom.

105
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,317
It was right there. The
instruments don't lie.

106
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,419
They lied to us today.

107
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:04,489
Weapons, shut down our
torpedo. Aye, Captain.

108
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:06,124
Shutting down torpedo.

109
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:08,426
Secure from battle stations.

110
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,831
This is why we have sea trials.

111
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,201
There's a bug in the system.

112
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,870
A ghost in the machine.

113
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:23,942
It's time
to go home. Captain!

114
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,776
Our own torpedo
is not responding.

115
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,112
It's coming right at us!

116
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:29,780
Our torpedo's homing,
range 400 meters!

117
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:30,914
Oh, my God. Wire command.

118
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,417
Shut down our weapon!

119
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,988
Our torpedo's still
closing, range 200 meters!

120
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:40,292
Blow all main ballast tanks!
Sound the collision alar...

121
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,252
Food delivery.

122
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,397
Hello?

123
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:01,973
Designator.

124
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:03,441
Easy.

125
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,077
Easy.

126
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,547
Designator.

127
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,285
India-Zulu-254.

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,222
Bravo-Echo-11.

129
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,191
No, not yet.

130
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,727
You need to ask me the
security question first.

131
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,662
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

132
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:26,631
Uh...

133
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,933
what is the oath?

134
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:36,107
We live and die
in the shadows...

135
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,177
for those we hold close...

136
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,480
and for those we never meet.

137
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,986
You can put it on the table.

138
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:04,602
Hey.

139
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,707
Welcome to the IMF.

140
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,478
You made the right choice.

141
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,283
Sir.

142
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,657
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

143
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,693
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

144
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:32,263
<i>Our lives are the
sum of our choices,</i>

145
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,567
<i>and we cannot escape the past.</i>

146
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,437
<i>Thirty years ago, you
were offered the choice.</i>

147
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:43,475
<i>Join the IMF or spend
your life in prison.</i>

148
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:46,778
<i>Because of your unique
natural talents,</i>

149
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:48,980
<i>your government forgave you.</i>

150
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:51,316
<i>But we will never forget.</i>

151
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,052
<i>Just as you will
never forget the death</i>

152
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:57,088
<i>that brought you to us
all those years ago.</i>

153
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,104
<i>This is to remind you</i>

154
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,640
<i>of your oath and
allegiance to us.</i>

155
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,344
<i>The stakes of this mission
are higher than ever.</i>

156
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:22,847
<i>Your habitual rogue behavior
will not be tolerated.</i>

157
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:24,482
<i>Should you choose to accept,</i>

158
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,619
<i>it is imperative
that you listen.</i>

159
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,089
<i>Your government is
searching for a key.</i>

160
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,325
<i>Its purpose, its
vital importance to us</i>

161
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,895
<i>is none of your concern.</i>

162
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,563
<i>What should concern you</i>

163
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:42,200
<i>is the involvement of
your friend Ilsa Faust.</i>

164
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:45,737
<i>She killed a
courier in Istanbul.</i>

165
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,106
<i>And we believe he
was carrying one half</i>

166
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,975
<i>of the key we're searching for.</i>

167
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,947
<i>Why she has chosen to interfere
in this affair is a mystery,</i>

168
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,248
<i>as are her whereabouts.</i>

169
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:59,517
<i>What is certain</i>

170
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:02,520
<i>is that your government has
put a price on her head...</i>

171
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:07,258
<i>and these bounty hunters
are out to collect it.</i>

172
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,030
<i>They never bring a
fugitive back alive,</i>

173
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,531
<i>and rarely in one piece.</i>

174
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:17,302
<i>We believe they're headed for the
Arabian Desert's Empty Quarter</i>

175
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,770
<i>in search of your friend.</i>

176
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:23,474
<i>Find the bounty hunters,
and you may just find her.</i>

177
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,611
<i>Your mission, should
you choose to accept it,</i>

178
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:30,181
<i>is to acquire the key
and deliver it to us.</i>

179
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,785
<i>What happens to Ilsa
after that is up to you.</i>

180
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,787
<i>As always,</i>

181
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,423
<i>if any members of your
team are caught or killed,</i>

182
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:42,061
<i>the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.</i>

183
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:46,898
<i>This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

184
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:49,434
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

185
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,435
Come.

186
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,319
Ethan.

187
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,951
Hyah! Hyah!

188
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:13,838
Ohh!

189
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,251
So what are we dealing with?

190
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:02,887
This "entity" has
multiple personalities,

191
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:05,389
at times behaving
like a computer virus,

192
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,525
then a tapeworm, then a botnet.

193
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:09,660
Distorting any and all
digital information

194
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,330
with which it comes in contact.

195
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:13,966
Once infected, nothing
recorded, stored,

196
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,902
or transmitted digitally
can be trusted as fact.

197
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:20,671
At the outset, it concentrated
primarily on news and social media

198
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,274
which was of little
concern to us

199
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:23,909
as it often suited our purposes.

200
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,011
Until six months ago,
when the entity breached

201
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,446
Saudi Arabia's General
Intelligence Directorate.

202
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,816
And assimilated their top
secret active-learning AI

203
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,086
before vanishing into the cloud.

204
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:37,289
Subsequent attacks increased
ten-thousandfold overnight,

205
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,091
spreading exponentially.

206
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:42,160
Indicating that the
Entity has since become

207
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:43,996
sentient.

208
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,930
You're telling me this
thing has a mind of its own?

209
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,766
<i>Over the last
three weeks alone,</i>

210
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,502
<i>it has accessed our
satellite telecommunications,</i>

211
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,704
<i>the Federal Reserve,
the stock market,</i>

212
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,307
<i>and the national power grid.</i>

213
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:56,607
<i>The FAA, NASA</i>

214
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,542
<i>and the combined
branches of our military.</i>

215
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:00,078
<i>And we're not alone.</i>

216
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:03,148
<i>It has penetrated the World
and European Central Banks.</i>

217
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:04,922
<i>Gained entry
to the major defense,</i>

218
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,651
<i>finance and
infrastructure systems</i>

219
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:11,123
<i>of Russia, India, Israel,
Australasia, all of Europe.</i>

220
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:14,126
<i>And what did it do
to all these systems exactly?</i>

221
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,526
Nothing.

222
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,529
Nothing? It came and it went,

223
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,699
leaving fingerprints where
they could easily be found

224
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,802
and sending a very
clear message.

225
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,838
"I shall return."

226
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:31,642
Whatever its ultimate goal is,
we're powerless to stop it.

227
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:34,246
The full force of its
energy is now directed

228
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:35,579
at a single objective.

229
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,515
The world's
intelligence networks.

230
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:39,850
The very truth as we know it.

231
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:43,088
<i>The entire intelligence
community is racing</i>

232
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,655
<i>to archive hard copies</i>

233
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:46,791
<i>of our fact-positive
knowledge bases</i>

234
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,826
<i>before our most
secure data centers</i>

235
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,795
<i>are breached and corrupted.</i>

236
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,730
<i>Which is only
a matter of time.</i>

237
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,567
<i>The Entity will know precisely
how to undermine our every strength</i>

238
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,669
<i>and exploit our every weakness.</i>

239
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:01,440
How to turn our
allies into enemies

240
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:04,575
and our enemies into aggressors.

241
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,212
Why not air-gap our
intelligence servers?

242
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:09,880
Cut them off from the
outside world entirely?

243
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:11,016
We already have.

244
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:14,286
But servers require
humans to maintain them.

245
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,488
And humans are the weakest
link in any security chain,

246
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:21,792
especially when dealing with a
godless, stateless, amoral enemy.

247
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,129
One that has
been patiently listening,

248
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:25,730
reading, watching.

249
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:29,401
Harvesting our deepest
personal secrets for years.

250
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:34,206
Able to beguile, blackmail,
bribe or be anyone it wants.

251
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:37,943
And to manipulate us at will
through our total dependence

252
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,146
on a carefully constructed
digital reality.

253
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,248
An enemy that is everywhere...

254
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:46,385
and nowhere...

255
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,120
and has no center.

256
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,159
All right,

257
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,762
so what you're telling me is the
most awesome goddamn intelligence

258
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:00,298
and tactical apparatus
on the planet

259
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,201
has no way of
killing this thing.

260
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:06,004
You don't want to kill it, sir.

261
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:08,873
You want to control it.

262
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,776
And how do we do
that, Mr. Kittridge?

263
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:15,579
The CIA's assets in
the Kremlin informed us

264
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:17,115
that the Russians have focused

265
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:20,052
the majority of their
intelligence activity

266
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:23,888
on acquiring two halves
of a cruciform key.

267
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,723
And what does it unlock?

268
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,792
Not exactly sure.

269
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:30,262
But the Russians seem to
believe that it somehow has

270
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:33,432
the power to deactivate
our mysterious Entity.

271
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:35,067
Though, ideally...

272
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:39,004
they hope to control
it, harness it.

273
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,140
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

274
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:46,211
What matters is that the rest
of the world believes it.

275
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:49,214
Japan, India, Germany,
and the Brits believe it,

276
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:53,085
and yet no one, not
even our closest allies,

277
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:56,021
have willingly whispered
one word of it to us.

278
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,722
Which would indicate that
there's a global race on

279
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,560
to acquire the two
halves of this key.

280
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,894
Every nation in
it for themselves,

281
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,897
not to kill this thing, sir,

282
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:09,101
but to weaponize it.

283
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:10,435
And in so doing,

284
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:15,273
establish a new, incontestable
form of global dominance.

285
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,109
How do we find this key first?

286
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:20,579
Well, we know that a buyer is passing
somewhere through the Middle East

287
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:23,381
sometime in the next 72 hours.

288
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,750
We believe that he already
has one half of this key.

289
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:28,719
You believe.
At this point,

290
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,455
we can't be certain
it's not a counterfeit.

291
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:32,057
How would you verify that?

292
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,960
The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key

293
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,395
is the other genuine
half of the key.

294
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,696
Its true mate, if you will.

295
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:40,764
We think it's some
sort of fail-safe.

296
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,200
How do we find its mate?

297
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:45,636
Well, we believe the other
genuine half of the key

298
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:47,305
was in the hands of this woman.

299
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,307
Who is she?

300
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:50,708
<i>Ilsa Faust.</i>

301
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:52,377
<i>Former
British Intelligence.</i>

302
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,345
Where is she now?

303
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:54,980
She's dead, sir.

304
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:56,982
She was... excuse me...

305
00:20:57,115 --> 00:21:00,651
<i>killed by mercenaries
looking to collect a bounty.</i>

306
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:02,053
And who put up the bounty?

307
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:04,556
Given her body of work,
could have been anyone.

308
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:06,925
So anyone could have
her half of the key?

309
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,294
Hmm, not just anyone.

310
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,164
I sent a man to find her,

311
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:14,366
the only man she
would have entrusted

312
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:15,499
with her half of the key.

313
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,135
Does he have it, Kittridge?

314
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:18,869
Well, at present, I
don't know that, sir.

315
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,373
He's refused to come in.

316
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:23,774
Refused? Hmm.

317
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,477
Who the hell is this guy?

318
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,978
That's classified.

319
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:30,115
I'm the goddamn Director
of National Intelligence.

320
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,350
What exactly is it I'm not
supposed to know about?

321
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:34,085
The IMF. Mr. Kittridge.

322
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,539
The world bank. No, that's the
International Monetary Fund.

323
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:37,622
Mr. Kittridge.

324
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,991
No, I mean the
other IMF. Ours.

325
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,927
What does it stand for?

326
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:44,362
Impossible Mission Force.

327
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:46,498
You're not serious.

328
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,433
I'm afraid he is.

329
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,202
And what do they do exactly?

330
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:53,271
It's just as the name implies.
Whatever the rest of us can't.

331
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:55,706
And who is in charge? They're
not ones to take orders

332
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,840
in the traditional sense.

333
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:58,742
We more or less...

334
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:01,947
leave word.

335
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,183
Leave... word.

336
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:06,685
Mr. Kittridge, sir.

337
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,297
The IMF operates
outside the community

338
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,388
and answers directly
to the president.

339
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:11,889
So let me get this straight.

340
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:14,993
When there's a mission
none of you can handle...

341
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:19,631
you just leave word
for a nameless man

342
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,733
and hope he gets the job done.

343
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:23,834
Is that it?

344
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:26,870
Should he choose to accept it.

345
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:28,273
What the hell kind of outfit

346
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,575
gets to choose what
orders to accept?

347
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,143
The IMF was expressly created

348
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:36,014
to ensure there would be
no unintended consequences.

349
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,150
If they cannot ensure a
mission's ultimate outcome,

350
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:41,253
they're authorized to decline.

351
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,472
I understand.

352
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,541
You're upset.

353
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:39,077
I'm not upset, Kittridge.

354
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:42,147
You wanted me to listen.

355
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,351
This is me listening.

356
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,220
All right.

357
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,189
I put the
bounty on Ilsa's head.

358
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,525
I also told you how to find her!

359
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,893
I didn't ask her
to steal the key.

360
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:59,297
She did that for reasons
of her own. But...

361
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:02,833
that's the pattern, isn't it?

362
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,637
You get her out of trouble,

363
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,207
and she always found
her way back in.

364
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,152
Wait! Ilsa!

365
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:23,887
Ilsa, wait! It's me! What?

366
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:25,223
It's me.

367
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:33,198
It's okay.

368
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,634
Listen to me! You're
dead! You stay dead!

369
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:11,903
Ethan, wait!

370
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,610
I'm not going to
apologize to you, Hunt.

371
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,912
It's my job to use you.

372
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,615
Just like it's your
job to be of use.

373
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:27,585
Did you accomplish your
mission or not?

374
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,692
Wherever the other
half of this is,

375
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,996
whatever the
completed key unlocks,

376
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:39,597
I will find it.

377
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:42,467
And then what?

378
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,704
No one should be trusted
with control of the Entity.

379
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:48,940
I mean to kill it.

380
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:50,341
Ethan,

381
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:52,710
the next world war isn't
gonna be a cold one.

382
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,512
It's gonna be a shooting war,

383
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:57,582
it's gonna be a ballistic war over
a rapidly shrinking ecosystem.

384
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:00,752
It's gonna be a war for the
last of our dwindling energy,

385
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:03,254
drinkable water, breathable air.

386
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:07,592
Whoever controls the
Entity controls the truth.

387
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,862
The concepts of right and wrong

388
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:15,533
can be clearly defined for
everyone for centuries to come.

389
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,202
Do you even hear yourself?

390
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:22,474
Your days of fighting for
the so-called greater good

391
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,043
are over.

392
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:27,445
You need to pick a side.

393
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:30,748
I'm on the same side
I've always been on.

394
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:34,352
Stay out of my way.

395
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,454
I can't do that.

396
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,290
We're gonna be coming after you.

397
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:41,526
The world's gonna
be coming after you.

398
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,497
And one way or another,
this mission of yours

399
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,767
is gonna
cost you dearly.

400
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,980
If I don't get that, we're
gonna have company real soon.

401
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,797
Hello?

402
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,332
<i>Director
Denlinger, please.</i>

403
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,435
Uh, Director is
unavailable at the moment.

404
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,304
How can I help you?
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

405
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,806
CIA Director Eugene Kittridge.

406
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:30,009
<i>Designator?</i>

407
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:31,643
"Bassnote," lowercase,
all one word.

408
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,913
<i>Sir, we have a situation.</i>

409
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,113
No kidding.

410
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:37,282
<i>Your adjutant was
found unconscious</i>

411
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:38,951
<i>in his home ten minutes ago.</i>

412
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,451
<i>It appears he was drugged.</i>

413
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,021
I understand.

414
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:43,288
<i>I don't think you do, sir.</i>

415
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:45,623
<i>Security has him
entering this facility</i>

416
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:48,359
<i>fifteen minutes ago.</i> I
understand, thank you.

417
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,996
<i>Are you able to speak freely?</i>

418
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,263
No, thank you.

419
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:53,933
<i>A security team is on their way.</i>

420
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:55,985
<i>If you're in any danger,
simply hang up the phone</i>

421
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,201
<i>before I count to five.</i>

422
00:27:57,335 --> 00:27:59,038
<i>One, two...</i>

423
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:06,177
So just how do you plan
on getting out of here?

424
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:12,717
Of course.

425
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,688
<i>Listen up.</i>

426
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:26,391
<i>An American operative with a
grievance against his country</i>

427
00:29:26,524 --> 00:29:28,793
<i>is missing and
has malfunctioned.</i>

428
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:31,997
His agenda represents a threat
to our national interests,

429
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:34,432
and he must be
neutralized at all cost.

430
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,401
Anything in this
man's possession

431
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:39,938
is of vital importance and
must be captured intact.

432
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:45,010
The man himself is expendable.
He is not to be underestimated.

433
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:47,378
A master of
infiltration, deception,

434
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:49,547
sabotage and psych warfare.

435
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:52,283
For all intents and purposes,
ladies and gentlemen,

436
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,219
a mind-reading, shape-shifting
incarnation of chaos.

437
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,388
So, for your safety

438
00:29:57,522 --> 00:29:59,891
and the safety of
those around you,

439
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:01,592
do not consider him secure

440
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:05,630
unless you have driven a wooden
stake through his open heart.

441
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,266
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

442
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,172
A self-aware, self-learning,

443
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,873
truth-eating digital parasite

444
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:19,011
infesting all of cyberspace.

445
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:22,680
Well, it was bound
to happen sooner or later.

446
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:25,416
And the two halves of this
key just might provide

447
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,653
the means of
controlling this Entity.

448
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,389
Meaning every government
on the planet would kill us

449
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,058
just to get that key.

450
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:34,126
Including our own.

451
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:35,326
Exactly.

452
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,361
Putting us on an
unsanctioned mission

453
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:40,099
which has gone rogue
before it even started.

454
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:42,633
Meaning this very conversation

455
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,104
is technically an
act of treason.

456
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:48,673
Or as we like to
call it, Monday.

457
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,809
So what's the play?

458
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:54,445
A buyer's coming in on
Flight 746 from Amsterdam

459
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,115
for a 30-minute layover

460
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:59,151
at which time he is hoping to
purchase that half of the key.

461
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:01,019
And it stands to reason

462
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,922
the buyer will have the other half
of the key somewhere on their person.

463
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:06,992
Being the only way to
authenticate our half.

464
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:08,760
So how do we identify the buyer?

465
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:11,796
This Geiger counter will
detect a radiological signature

466
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,233
of the dragon's egg
embedded in the buyer's key.

467
00:31:14,365 --> 00:31:17,236
The augmented-reality
overlay in these glasses

468
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:18,937
will lead us to it.

469
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,839
Oh, that's very clever.

470
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:25,409
So, you ID the buyer,
pick his pockets,

471
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:26,945
Bob's your uncle. No.

472
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,646
No. Of course not.

473
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,281
The complete key is of no value

474
00:31:30,414 --> 00:31:31,694
if we don't know
what it unlocks.

475
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:34,253
So you're going
to sell the buyer

476
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:35,753
our half of the key.

477
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:38,157
While we figure out the
buyer's connecting flight

478
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:39,992
and book you a
seat on that plane.

479
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,195
So you can follow the
key wherever it goes.

480
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:44,762
Which you hope is into the hands

481
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,364
of someone who knows
what it unlocks.

482
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:47,431
Precisely.

483
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:49,734
Finding the completed key

484
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:51,769
is only the beginning.

485
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:54,539
The fate of the world
depends on finding

486
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:57,308
whatever it unlocks.

487
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:02,847
This guy, you know him?

488
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:05,516
Not personally.

489
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,618
But it is personal.

490
00:32:37,983 --> 00:32:39,084
Thank you.

491
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,925
Hey, what's that? What?

492
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:50,494
Security alert. Suspicious
bag on its way to Venice.

493
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:52,496
Nope, it's gone. Must
have been a false alarm.

494
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:03,574
Overwatch, Snap
Shot. Where's he at?

495
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:08,846
Snap Shot, Overwatch.
I have him.

496
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:11,716
Terminal B, Gate
15, headed south.

497
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:15,753
I am so. You are not.

498
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:19,657
Ethan, would you care to explain
to our friend the Net Ranger

499
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,960
<i>how I am just as capable
of writing code as he is?</i>

500
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:22,961
No comment.

501
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:24,762
What, you figure
Phineas Phreak here

502
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:26,965
is gonna single-handedly work
out a way to kill the Entity

503
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,067
<i>while I just hold
his soldering iron?</i>

504
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:31,003
Probably. Definitely.

505
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,039
Out of the way!

506
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:35,539
Tell me where he is.

507
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:37,309
<i>Where is he?</i> Blue suit.

508
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:39,077
Right in front of you.

509
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:53,125
Oh!

510
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,335
Oh! Ah! Ow!

511
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,337
It's not him.

512
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:06,504
It's him.

513
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:07,672
<i>I'm telling you, it's not him.</i>

514
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:08,739
And I'm telling you

515
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:10,909
facial comes back
with a perfect...

516
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:16,081
How did you do that?

517
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:19,217
No one is
safe from Phineas Phreak.

518
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:27,926
I got him.

519
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,395
<i>Where is he?</i>
Terminal E, Gate 5.

520
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,398
Goddamn it, that's clear on
the other side of the airport.

521
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,602
<i>Ethan, they're
headed to Terminal E.</i>

522
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:41,572
<i>That side of the
airport is all yours.</i>

523
00:34:42,274 --> 00:34:43,208
Thank you, Luther.

524
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,542
I see the buyer. <i>Got him.</i>

525
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:47,545
The buyer is Otto Von
Bork. Swiss national.

526
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:48,947
<i>He's connecting to Venice,</i>

527
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:51,917
<i>departing in 30
minutes on Flight 1031.</i>

528
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,952
Benji, get me on that
flight to Venice.

529
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:56,922
Yep, Flight 1031 to
Venice. Stand by.

530
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:08,833
What?

531
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,835
<i>Ethan,
what just happened?</i>

532
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:12,503
He was bumped. <i>Bumped?</i>

533
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:13,771
What do you mean, bumped?

534
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,008
<i>That woman picked
his pocket. Tag her.</i>

535
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:17,508
Tell me who she is.

536
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:27,486
Luther, mute our comms.

537
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:28,819
What is it?

538
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:30,474
That bag was on its
way to Flight 1031.

539
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:31,957
What bag?

540
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,326
There was a suspicious bag
alert, a few minutes ago.

541
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:35,494
So what about it?

542
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:37,029
It was on its way
to Flight 1031.

543
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:39,398
To Venice. It's
the buyer's plane.

544
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,531
It's Ethan's plane.

545
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:42,900
Luther, do you copy? Who is she?

546
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:44,602
What if it wasn't a false alarm?

547
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,905
What if somebody's trying to
smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

548
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:48,945
And what if that's what the
Entity wants us to think

549
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:50,641
to keep Ethan off that plane?

550
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,810
<i>Luther, what's
happening?</i> Should we warn him?

551
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,447
No. <i>Guys, guys?
Do you hear me?</i>

552
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,515
Find that bag.

553
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,116
I'll direct you. Go.

554
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,584
<i>Luther, just tell me, is
there something wrong?</i>

555
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:04,089
Nothing to worry about.
It's under control.

556
00:36:04,222 --> 00:36:04,990
Got her.

557
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,959
Info on the woman is coming now.

558
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:10,795
<i>Whoa.</i>

559
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:14,598
<i>Whoever she is, she's no spy.</i>

560
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:16,667
She's a thief.

561
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,103
<i>Where am
I going, Luther?</i>

562
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:20,539
Benji, there's a door
on your immediate left.

563
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,873
<i>I'm unlocking it now.</i>

564
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:29,448
The bag you're after
is on tray 01833

565
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,583
<i>heading towards the northwest
corner of the facility.</i>

566
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:34,052
Copy that!

567
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:46,098
Hi.

568
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,667
Hello.

569
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,772
Oh, I get it.

570
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,309
You thought I was someone else.

571
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:00,946
I'm not interested.

572
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,814
Give me a chance.

573
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:05,683
I'll scream.

574
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,453
Please do.

575
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:13,091
What do you want?

576
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:15,293
This key.

577
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,464
The one you picked
from that man's pocket.

578
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:21,099
It's worthless

579
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,267
without this key.

580
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:25,904
But together

581
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:27,757
they're worth four
million in cryptocurrency

582
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,874
that man was carrying
on a flash drive.

583
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:33,382
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

584
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:35,313
Then why was this
drive in your pocket?

585
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:38,550
Who are you?

586
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:39,884
You working with someone?

587
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:43,388
Never. I'm strictly single-0.

588
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,556
Today you got a partner.

589
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,458
I need the man you
stole this from

590
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:47,725
to complete a transaction

591
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:49,458
and leave this airport
with both of these

592
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:51,101
without ever knowing
his pocket was picked

593
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:52,597
and before he boards
his flight in...

594
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,200
<i>Seven
minutes.</i> Seven minutes.

595
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,236
We both know you're
a good pickpocket.

596
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,738
Let's see what kind
of put-pocket you are.

597
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,842
You expect me to put it back.

598
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:07,145
Oh, I know you will.

599
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:08,313
You're a thief.

600
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:10,949
You want the money. And
I can give it to you.

601
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,418
Your choice.

602
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,121
You're in or you're out.

603
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,723
All right.

604
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:21,259
So what's the play?

605
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:23,273
<i>I sure hope you
know what you're doing.</i>

606
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,096
After you.

607
00:38:26,965 --> 00:38:29,534
Oh, I won't be needing this.

608
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:31,336
I don't smoke.

609
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:35,240
Keep it. Something
to remember me by.

610
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:44,916
Ethan, the alloy in that key she
took off the buyer doesn't match.

611
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,984
It's counterfeit.

612
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,718
I expect nothing less.

613
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:49,331
<i>But that doesn't
change our objective.</i>

614
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:50,989
<i>The buyer has to
leave with both keys.</i>

615
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,890
<i>Talk to me, Luther!
Where am I going?</i>

616
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:54,892
Benji, head down the
stairs in front of you

617
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:56,494
and the bag should
be right there.

618
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,263
Okay. I'm there. I'm there.

619
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:00,999
Uh...

620
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:04,703
That's him.

621
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,304
<i>Right in front of you.</i>

622
00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:11,109
Okay, okay. Hey, sorry.
Thought you were somebody else.

623
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:15,013
Hunt's jerking our chain.

624
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:18,283
Everybody! Two-man
teams, spread out.

625
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:21,319
Ethan, our American
friends are getting wise.

626
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,154
They're breaking up and
canvassing the airport.

627
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:24,623
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

628
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,491
So, what do I call you?

629
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,826
How about Grace? And you?

630
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,562
Well, listen, Grace.

631
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:32,735
You should know we're not
the only interested party.

632
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:34,566
If I tell you to run, you run.

633
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:36,101
Run?

634
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,702
This is getting exciting.

635
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:39,803
Benji, have you got that bag?

636
00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:41,206
I found it!

637
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,656
There's a cylindrical
device inside.

638
00:39:57,821 --> 00:39:59,124
<i>I'm gonna take it out.</i>

639
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:04,496
<i>How we doing, Luther?</i>

640
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:07,065
Ethan, the buyer's in the
waiting area above you.

641
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:09,301
<i>Top of the escalator.</i>

642
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:12,570
<i>All units are headed
in your direction.</i>

643
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,739
<i>Your location is going to
be crawling with agents</i>

644
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,374
<i>any time now.</i>

645
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:27,552
Whatever it is, I've
just activated it.

646
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:32,924
Uh, looks like we have
five minutes.

647
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,328
<i>Also, it appears to
be nuclear.</i> How big?

648
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:38,997
Big enough to matter to everybody
in this airport, I suspect.

649
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,999
Can you disarm it? I
haven't got any tools!

650
00:40:41,132 --> 00:40:43,535
<i>Then find some.</i> Where
am I gonna find...

651
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:09,294
Is this where we run?

652
00:41:09,794 --> 00:41:10,829
Not yet.

653
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,565
Benji, how are you
doing with that bomb?

654
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:14,933
Come on, come on.

655
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:17,268
I got it!

656
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:21,439
It's a cylinder cypher.
There's eight wheels.

657
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:23,874
Looks like 14 letters
on each wheel.

658
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:26,578
1.5 billion possible
combinations.

659
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:28,213
Give or take.

660
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:30,482
Oh, my God.

661
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:31,916
<i>What now?</i>

662
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,619
The wheels, they
spell out a message.

663
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,154
U.R.DUNN.

664
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:37,922
No way. Not yet we aren't.

665
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:39,858
No, Luther, not D-O-N-E.

666
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:42,460
D-U-N-N.

667
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:44,496
It's my last name.

668
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,900
It knows who I am.

669
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:04,549
Hold on. There's a
message on the display.

670
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:06,384
<i>"I speak without a mouth.</i>

671
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:08,987
I fly through the
air without wings.

672
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,588
What am I?" You got me. What?

673
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:13,224
It's a riddle. I suspect this
thing is voice-activated.

674
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:14,626
It wants me to say the answer.

675
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,494
"I fly through the air..."

676
00:42:17,562 --> 00:42:18,596
An echo!

677
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,432
That's it! That's it!

678
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:21,766
Okay, new message.

679
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,302
"Are you afraid of death?"

680
00:42:24,436 --> 00:42:26,738
What kind of a riddle is
that? <i>It's not a riddle.</i>

681
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:28,740
It's a psychometric test.

682
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:32,744
The more questions you answer,
the more it'll know about you.

683
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:35,046
"Are you afraid of death?" No!

684
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:38,983
<i>Did it work?</i> I lied. It knows.

685
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:41,252
Just tell it the truth. Say it.

686
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:44,456
"Are you afraid of
death?" Yes! Who isn't?

687
00:42:45,957 --> 00:42:47,459
<i>Pardon.</i>

688
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:57,937
Okay, "What's always approaching
but never arrives?" Um...

689
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:59,170
Wait, I know this one.

690
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:00,705
The clock is ticking, Luther.

691
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,879
Riddles aren't my thing,
Benji. What more can I say?

692
00:43:02,974 --> 00:43:04,609
We're running out of time!

693
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:08,580
There he is. Oh,
this is too easy.

694
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:10,315
<i>Sorry to bother you, Ethan.</i>

695
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:13,751
Would you happen to know
what's always approaching

696
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,119
but never arrives?

697
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:17,655
What is always approaching
but never arrives?

698
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:19,090
Tomorrow.

699
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,125
What?

700
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:23,127
Always approaching but
never arrives: Tomorrow.

701
00:43:23,963 --> 00:43:25,196
It's tomorrow. Tomorrow.

702
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,898
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

703
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:28,666
Yes! Okay, next question.

704
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,134
Give me the goods.

705
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:31,803
I'll be watching.

706
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:33,404
Why, you don't trust me?

707
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:40,512
Luther, what is happening?

708
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:43,681
Nothing to worry about.
Everything is under control.

709
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:45,083
Okay, next question:

710
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:48,353
"Who or what is the most
important thing to you?"

711
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,021
Say it. But if I...

712
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:51,689
There's no other
choice. Say it.

713
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,625
My friends.

714
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:55,793
Bastard.

715
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:09,340
Is he... Yes, he is.

716
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:11,342
Give me the money,
give me the key.

717
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,079
Okay. "What gets bigger
the more you take away?"

718
00:44:15,213 --> 00:44:17,715
A hole. A hole. Brilliant!

719
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,180
I've got no more questions
and there's one more wheel.

720
00:44:31,195 --> 00:44:33,515
How am I supposed to give
answers if I've got no questions?

721
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:35,066
That must be your final test.

722
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,168
I've got 45 seconds!

723
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:41,539
What happens now?

724
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:43,608
I'm thinking. Don't move.

725
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,276
Luther, I'm pinned
down. Need a way out.

726
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:46,311
<i>Where am I going?</i>

727
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:47,812
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

728
00:44:47,947 --> 00:44:50,148
It's very possible no one
is getting out of here.

729
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:52,650
What? There's a bomb
in baggage handling.

730
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:53,785
A nuclear bomb.

731
00:44:53,919 --> 00:44:55,153
<i>The question I asked you</i>

732
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:56,726
<i>is part of the code
for disarming it.</i>

733
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,122
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

734
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,892
Why didn't you tell me this?

735
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:03,127
You had a lot going on. We
didn't want to bother you.

736
00:45:03,261 --> 00:45:07,198
Listen to me. A nuclear bomb is
something you bother me with immediately.

737
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,133
How much time? Twenty seconds.

738
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:10,702
Twenty seconds?

739
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:11,937
There's one more riddle.

740
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:13,204
I'm working on it.
Fifteen seconds!

741
00:45:13,204 --> 00:45:14,907
Easy, easy. What's the riddle?

742
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,208
In the time it takes me to
explain, we'll all be dead!

743
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:18,978
Come on, Benji. Why
do we always end up

744
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,111
in these situations?

745
00:45:20,244 --> 00:45:21,779
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

746
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:23,247
<i>Nine... eight...</i>

747
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:26,751
seven... six... five...

748
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,455
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

749
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:39,031
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

750
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:40,298
What is it?

751
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:42,734
It's empty.

752
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,135
What do you mean, empty?

753
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:45,670
<i>There's nothing inside.</i>

754
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:51,977
She took the key.

755
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:52,911
Which key?

756
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:54,046
Our key. The real key.

757
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:55,380
What? <i>Luther, find her.</i>

758
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:07,392
I got her. She's
headed for Terminal E.

759
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:20,738
No, it can't be.

760
00:46:20,872 --> 00:46:21,572
What is it?

761
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,608
Luther, Benji. Abort. Get out!

762
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,743
Where do we
rendezvous? We don't!

763
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:28,846
This mission is
terminated. Get out now.

764
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:42,127
Hunt! Stop right there!

765
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,930
Hey! You see him? Where is he?

766
00:46:45,064 --> 00:46:46,831
Excuse me! Excuse me!

767
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:49,367
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

768
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:20,865
Move!

769
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:28,941
Move! Move, move!

770
00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:13,051
He's got to be here somewhere.

771
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,054
Goddamn.

772
00:48:26,497 --> 00:48:28,900
What we have here
is shortwave radio,

773
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:33,437
magnetic audio recording,
cathode ray tube monitors.

774
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:35,941
No more ones and zeros.

775
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:39,377
It's a fully analog,
offline safe room,

776
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,080
shielded from our
digitally-based Entity.

777
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:45,583
Where is this feed coming from?

778
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:48,686
CORONA spy satellite
from the Cold War.

779
00:48:49,654 --> 00:48:51,455
Had no idea we were
still using those things.

780
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:53,091
Yeah, well, we weren't.

781
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:55,493
Gave them to the National
Weather Service 20 years ago.

782
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:57,628
This is the last one
still functioning.

783
00:48:57,762 --> 00:49:01,934
So, will this thing help us
find your nameless IMF man?

784
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,768
Nothing can do that, sir.

785
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:07,672
But it has allowed us to
keep tabs on this woman.

786
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:12,643
She was seen with our man
at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

787
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:14,712
Who is she?

788
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,381
Where is she now?

789
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:29,760
You are here

790
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:32,430
because Italian police
received an anonymous tip

791
00:49:32,563 --> 00:49:34,233
that a woman matching
your description

792
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:37,702
would be arriving on the
afternoon flight from Abu Dhabi.

793
00:49:37,835 --> 00:49:41,706
This woman had multiple
passports in her possession.

794
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,843
This one is wanted for
fraud in Saint Petersburg.

795
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:49,780
Jewel theft in Antwerp.
Art theft in Monaco.

796
00:49:49,915 --> 00:49:53,252
Graft in Milan.
Extortion in Mumbai.

797
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:55,921
But this is my favorite:

798
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:58,156
resisting arrest in Rio.

799
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,060
Which leads me to wonder...

800
00:50:03,394 --> 00:50:05,130
which one of these women is you?

801
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:08,200
I've never seen these
before in my life.

802
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,600
They were in your purse.

803
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:12,603
And your picture
is in every one.

804
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:15,107
May I see? Please.

805
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:22,281
Yes, it's an amazing likeness,

806
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:24,149
but it isn't me.

807
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,985
As I keep telling you, I'm...

808
00:50:27,953 --> 00:50:29,553
I'm a schoolteacher
from Brighton.

809
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,256
I'm on a sabbatical.

810
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,258
Whatever you're involved in,

811
00:50:33,392 --> 00:50:37,062
you've obviously made some
very powerful enemies.

812
00:50:45,971 --> 00:50:47,039
<i>Sì.</i>

813
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:48,839
Okay.

814
00:50:52,377 --> 00:50:53,611
Her lawyer is here.

815
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:55,546
My lawyer?

816
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:32,616
Magistrate Spezzi.

817
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,885
I'm sorry, who are you?

818
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,321
Interpol.

819
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:42,060
I've come regarding the arrest
of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

820
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:43,527
I'll need to inventory

821
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,621
the items on her person
at the time of her arrest.

822
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,632
May I see some
identification, please?

823
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,835
Where's the rest?

824
00:51:51,535 --> 00:51:53,171
I assure you, this
is everything.

825
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:54,505
What was your name?

826
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:56,807
She left Abu Dhabi
with a certain key.

827
00:51:57,309 --> 00:51:58,477
There was no key.

828
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:00,711
It was an unusual sort.

829
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:03,781
One that you could
mistake for a pendant.

830
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:08,286
The kind that you'd be
tempted to hang on a chain

831
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,088
around Amelia's neck.

832
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:12,924
Amelia?

833
00:52:13,691 --> 00:52:14,926
Your wife.

834
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:18,662
Mother of your lovely
daughter Serena.

835
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:20,032
You're not Interpol.

836
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:22,566
I am if I wish to be.

837
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:26,905
I can be anything,
and I know everything.

838
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:28,639
I know this wouldn't
be the first time

839
00:52:28,773 --> 00:52:30,775
you've helped yourself
to stolen goods.

840
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:32,144
A Cartier bracelet.

841
00:52:32,843 --> 00:52:34,678
You were cleared of suspicion,

842
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:36,892
but we both know you gave
it to your mistress Valeria

843
00:52:36,915 --> 00:52:40,919
on August 21st,
her 29th birthday.

844
00:52:41,053 --> 00:52:43,055
Who are you?

845
00:52:44,755 --> 00:52:47,092
I'm gonna have to search you,

846
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:48,126
just to be sure.

847
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,599
Your secretary's
no longer with us.

848
00:53:33,604 --> 00:53:35,173
You.

849
00:53:35,307 --> 00:53:36,674
You did this.

850
00:53:36,807 --> 00:53:38,110
I called the police.

851
00:53:38,243 --> 00:53:40,912
I didn't tell them about
your colorful past.

852
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:44,216
That's on you.

853
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,918
You put-pocketed that
key on another passenger

854
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:48,686
before you were arrested.

855
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:51,590
<i>You exchanged details and
arranged to meet later on.</i>

856
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:53,024
<i>Right now,</i>

857
00:53:53,158 --> 00:53:54,593
<i>someone out there hasn't
the slightest clue</i>

858
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:56,161
<i>they're holding on
to that key for you.</i>

859
00:53:56,794 --> 00:53:58,463
<i>An unwitting courier.</i>

860
00:53:58,597 --> 00:53:59,830
<i>The perfect accomplice.</i>

861
00:54:00,831 --> 00:54:03,767
<i>I'm guessing a man, middle-aged?</i>

862
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:06,037
A man waiting his whole life

863
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:08,940
to be noticed by
a woman like you.

864
00:54:10,275 --> 00:54:11,642
An orphan.

865
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,914
Highly intelligent.
Inherently resourceful.

866
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:19,884
Growing up in poverty left you
longing for the finer things.

867
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,120
Other people's things.

868
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,888
Someone saw your potential

869
00:54:24,022 --> 00:54:26,925
and helped you hone your skills.

870
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:29,361
Skills that gave you the
life you thought you wanted.

871
00:54:29,494 --> 00:54:32,931
Tailored clothes, fine
dining, luxury hotels.

872
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:36,268
Skills that kept you one
step ahead of the law...

873
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:38,669
until now.

874
00:54:40,372 --> 00:54:41,273
You can't blame a girl

875
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:43,275
for trying to make
a dishonest living.

876
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,078
You had no idea what
you were stealing.

877
00:54:47,212 --> 00:54:49,114
Otherwise, you never
would have stolen it.

878
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:51,650
Tell you what.

879
00:54:51,782 --> 00:54:52,984
You get me out of here,

880
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:55,353
and I'll take you
straight to the key.

881
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,787
I have a better idea.

882
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,323
You're gonna tell me everything.

883
00:54:58,456 --> 00:55:00,625
Then I'll think about
getting you out of here.

884
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:02,793
Now start with who hired you.

885
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:05,863
And don't lie to me
because I'll know.

886
00:55:05,997 --> 00:55:07,532
I have no idea who hired me.

887
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:10,268
Contact with the client was
almost entirely electronic.

888
00:55:10,402 --> 00:55:11,336
Email? Texts.

889
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:12,604
Encrypted? Naturally.

890
00:55:12,736 --> 00:55:14,272
Almost? Pardon?

891
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:17,075
You said contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

892
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:19,710
There was a dead drop
in a café in Luxembourg.

893
00:55:19,843 --> 00:55:21,580
An envelope. What
was in the envelope?

894
00:55:21,712 --> 00:55:23,747
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

895
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:25,951
And...

896
00:55:26,518 --> 00:55:29,221
a picture of you.

897
00:55:31,056 --> 00:55:33,016
My instructions were to
follow you at the airport.

898
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:34,459
You'd be tailing a mark.

899
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:35,694
Said mark would have a key

900
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:37,462
and four million
in cryptocurrency.

901
00:55:37,596 --> 00:55:40,131
That drive was useless,
by the way. It was empty.

902
00:55:40,898 --> 00:55:42,300
The only hope I
have of getting paid

903
00:55:42,434 --> 00:55:43,867
is to deliver your
half of the key.

904
00:55:44,002 --> 00:55:46,504
And you were instructed
to deliver it to?

905
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:47,838
Venice.

906
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,141
Party at Ducale Palace.
Tomorrow. Midnight.

907
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:54,878
You expecting someone?

908
00:55:55,013 --> 00:55:56,948
Your friends from the airport.

909
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:58,816
Saw them in the hallway
a few minutes ago.

910
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:03,221
You could have said
something sooner.

911
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:05,657
Well, they were
chasing you, not me.

912
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,248
A <i>pervertito!</i>

913
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,518
No, Grace, Grace.

914
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,655
No, no, no.

915
00:56:39,823 --> 00:56:40,992
<i>Grazie.</i>

916
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:42,560
Grace.

917
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,334
No, no. No.

918
00:56:50,302 --> 00:56:52,971
<i>Tranquillo. Tranquillo.</i>

919
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:23,768
No, no! Move! Move!

920
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:28,239
Sorry!

921
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:41,019
Come on.

922
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,391
Who parks like that?

923
00:58:04,743 --> 00:58:07,078
Grace! You got to pull over.

924
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:09,047
Grace. Pull over. Listen.

925
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,083
I'm trying to help you! Grace!

926
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:12,951
Aah!

927
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:50,188
Uhh.

928
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:52,490
Are you okay? You okay?

929
00:58:52,624 --> 00:58:53,425
No, no, no.

930
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:01,366
Give me your hand.

931
00:59:01,499 --> 00:59:04,235
Slow, slow, slow. It's okay.

932
00:59:04,836 --> 00:59:06,037
Slow.

933
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,640
Is anything broken?
Are you okay? You okay?

934
00:59:08,773 --> 00:59:10,074
Hunt!

935
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:11,976
It's over!

936
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:14,112
Let the girl go.

937
00:59:14,245 --> 00:59:15,713
Put the bracelets on.

938
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:20,151
There you go. Put
them on. Do it!

939
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:22,554
It's okay, he's not
gonna shoot you.

940
00:59:31,663 --> 00:59:34,866
Goddamn it, Degas, get
rid of those women.

941
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:37,202
Hunt, listen to
me. Listen to me.

942
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:39,137
Let her go and put them on.

943
00:59:43,107 --> 00:59:44,042
It's okay!

944
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:46,244
It's okay! It's okay!

945
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:52,050
Everybody down! Get down!

946
00:59:56,354 --> 00:59:59,023
Down, down! Cover,
cover! Cover!

947
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:31,723
You're driving. What?

948
01:00:31,856 --> 01:00:33,258
No, no, no!

949
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:35,760
Go, go, go. Hit
the accelerator.

950
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:37,362
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

951
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:42,667
Aah!

952
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:47,940
Go, go, go, go, go!

953
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:52,477
Oh!

954
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:06,324
Get in!

955
01:01:06,457 --> 01:01:08,126
You're good. Just
keep it going.

956
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:10,061
Don't stop, don't stop.

957
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:20,805
Car, car, car.

958
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:32,517
It's okay. Just put your foot
on the brake. Start the car.

959
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,019
Wait, wait, wait!

960
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:36,321
Wh-What's happening? I'm
done. I'm not doing this.

961
01:01:36,454 --> 01:01:38,057
People are chasing us.

962
01:01:38,189 --> 01:01:40,025
Yes, they are. You're driving.

963
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:41,259
Now come on.

964
01:02:12,724 --> 01:02:14,258
Who is that person?

965
01:02:14,392 --> 01:02:16,127
I have no idea.

966
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:22,900
You okay? I will be
when this is over.

967
01:02:25,603 --> 01:02:27,205
Oh, man.

968
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:32,810
It's okay. It's okay.

969
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:34,913
Whoa!

970
01:02:45,256 --> 01:02:46,524
Is there anyone not chasing us?

971
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:48,793
We got to get rid of this car.

972
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,164
Scooters! Damn it.

973
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:15,887
What are we doing?

974
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:19,757
Finding us a new car.

975
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:26,464
Whoa! Jesus!

976
01:03:41,612 --> 01:03:42,915
Okay.

977
01:03:59,397 --> 01:04:00,732
Just give me a second.

978
01:04:00,865 --> 01:04:01,799
Yeah, mm-hm.

979
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:03,234
Thanks. Okay? Yeah.

980
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:04,937
You ready? I'm ready.

981
01:04:08,773 --> 01:04:09,707
Wow.

982
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:11,043
You okay? Mm-hm.

983
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:13,444
Yeah, look, I'm
sorry. This is...

984
01:04:13,578 --> 01:04:15,646
It's okay. No, this
car, the way they...

985
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,348
It's okay. No, the
way they set them up,

986
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:18,416
sometimes it's just...

987
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:19,952
Let's go. It takes me...

988
01:04:20,085 --> 01:04:21,319
Let's go.

989
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:54,019
Now I got you.

990
01:05:02,727 --> 01:05:04,328
Looks like we lost them.

991
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:31,023
Let's just...

992
01:05:31,156 --> 01:05:32,390
Move, move, move!

993
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,375
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!

994
01:06:04,056 --> 01:06:05,123
Wait, what?

995
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,125
No, no, no.

996
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:14,432
Go, go, go!

997
01:06:17,602 --> 01:06:19,503
Whoa, that's... Go straight.

998
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:27,812
Just take your foot
off the accelerator.

999
01:06:27,812 --> 01:06:29,014
We're on fire! No, no, no.

1000
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:31,116
It's the tires. Just
try to go straight.

1001
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:34,585
Hang on. Why is it spinning?

1002
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:38,156
Good, good, good!

1003
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:42,160
I've got it, I've
got it, I've got it.

1004
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:44,462
Turn right. Down there.

1005
01:06:44,595 --> 01:06:46,064
Right there! Come on!

1006
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:56,074
Got to go right. Turn right!

1007
01:06:58,676 --> 01:07:00,745
Who's driving? You're driving.

1008
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:02,880
Go, go, go. Just go straight.

1009
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:06,952
Go, go, go. Just
keep going straight.

1010
01:07:07,085 --> 01:07:10,855
Or left. Go, go, go.
You're doing good.

1011
01:07:16,527 --> 01:07:18,163
Cops! A lot of cops!

1012
01:07:19,364 --> 01:07:20,898
Take the wheel.

1013
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:22,000
Brake, brake, brake.

1014
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,540
Okay, your wheel.

1015
01:07:31,575 --> 01:07:33,444
Straight? Right, right, right.

1016
01:07:33,577 --> 01:07:34,812
Got it!

1017
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:45,090
Which way now?
Left, left, left.

1018
01:07:52,863 --> 01:07:55,200
Okay. You're
good, you're good.

1019
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:01,472
That's a person.

1020
01:08:03,774 --> 01:08:05,509
Okay, car, car. I see it!

1021
01:08:32,371 --> 01:08:33,771
Hit it.

1022
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:42,147
Hang on!

1023
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,814
Go, go, go, go.

1024
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:45,050
Aah!

1025
01:08:53,624 --> 01:08:55,327
What is happening?
Where are we going?

1026
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,694
I don't know.

1027
01:08:57,561 --> 01:08:59,530
Okay, brake, brake, brake!

1028
01:09:28,893 --> 01:09:30,195
Don't hate me.

1029
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:35,167
Grace? Grace!

1030
01:09:50,549 --> 01:09:51,649
Come on, come on.

1031
01:10:20,212 --> 01:10:21,480
Ethan!

1032
01:10:21,612 --> 01:10:22,847
Ethan!

1033
01:10:26,585 --> 01:10:28,752
Well, come on.

1034
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,876
All right. We know Grace
has one half of the key.

1035
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:28,613
We also know she's gonna be
at the Ducale at midnight.

1036
01:11:28,746 --> 01:11:30,066
And now we have a
pretty good idea

1037
01:11:30,148 --> 01:11:32,217
as to who will be
waiting for her there.

1038
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:34,119
The event is being
hosted by none other than

1039
01:11:34,252 --> 01:11:37,189
our favorite international arms
trafficker and black marketeer,

1040
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:38,390
Alana Mitsopolis.

1041
01:11:38,523 --> 01:11:40,125
The White Widow.

1042
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:42,394
Does she know who
you actually are,

1043
01:11:42,527 --> 01:11:46,231
or does she still think you're the
globally notorious mass murderer John Lark?

1044
01:11:46,364 --> 01:11:47,265
Who says I'm not?

1045
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:50,569
Didn't she put a price
on your head in Paris?

1046
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:51,902
She did indeed.

1047
01:11:52,037 --> 01:11:55,340
She and Ethan,
they worked it out.

1048
01:11:55,473 --> 01:11:56,942
You never did tell me how.

1049
01:11:57,075 --> 01:11:58,944
Can we continue, please?

1050
01:11:59,077 --> 01:12:00,378
Right.

1051
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:02,447
So, assuming we get the complete
key at the party tonight,

1052
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,082
we still don't know
what it unlocks.

1053
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:05,749
So we need to find
somebody who does.

1054
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:08,320
The question is where
to start looking.

1055
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:10,522
We figured that the
bomb didn't just walk

1056
01:12:10,655 --> 01:12:11,735
into the airport by itself.

1057
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,015
Right? Somebody put it there.

1058
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:15,594
Somebody working for the Entity.

1059
01:12:15,726 --> 01:12:16,886
This is everything I captured

1060
01:12:16,995 --> 01:12:19,097
from the security
cameras at the airport

1061
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:21,399
up to the minute
everything went haywire.

1062
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:24,802
And this is the feed
from your AR sunglasses.

1063
01:12:24,936 --> 01:12:26,471
I've been running
facial recognition

1064
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:27,906
on everyone in the airport.

1065
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:29,474
See anything strange?

1066
01:12:32,776 --> 01:12:33,945
It's like a ghost.

1067
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:36,047
Ghosts don't have reflections.

1068
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:43,321
The only person in the
airport with no identity.

1069
01:12:43,455 --> 01:12:47,825
The only man who can't be found
anyplace else in the airport

1070
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:50,328
except that reflection.

1071
01:12:51,463 --> 01:12:53,164
He's being erased.

1072
01:12:53,298 --> 01:12:55,066
In real time.

1073
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,441
The Entity.

1074
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:06,044
It's protecting him.

1075
01:13:06,578 --> 01:13:08,513
You saw him, didn't you?

1076
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:12,384
I wasn't sure.

1077
01:13:13,718 --> 01:13:15,186
Well, who is he?

1078
01:13:22,494 --> 01:13:24,062
Someone I thought...

1079
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:27,232
died a long time ago.

1080
01:13:27,365 --> 01:13:28,832
In another life.

1081
01:13:28,967 --> 01:13:31,169
Before the IMF.

1082
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:34,872
Before I was offered the choice.

1083
01:13:37,942 --> 01:13:39,944
And in a very real sense...

1084
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:42,813
he made me who I am today.

1085
01:13:44,549 --> 01:13:46,117
Does he have a name?

1086
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:49,054
He calls himself Gabriel.

1087
01:13:51,822 --> 01:13:53,391
You know him.

1088
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,295
There is no knowing him.

1089
01:13:58,496 --> 01:14:00,765
He has no recorded past.

1090
01:14:00,898 --> 01:14:02,833
The Entity made sure of that.

1091
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:05,136
He's a dark messiah.

1092
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:08,340
The Entity's chosen messenger.

1093
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:09,808
And he sees death...

1094
01:14:10,841 --> 01:14:15,080
as a gift he wants to share
with the rest of the world.

1095
01:14:15,213 --> 01:14:16,314
How do you know this?

1096
01:14:16,448 --> 01:14:19,451
I still have a few
friends left in MI6.

1097
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:21,653
Friends who are afraid

1098
01:14:21,786 --> 01:14:24,923
of the British government
gaining control of the Entity.

1099
01:14:25,657 --> 01:14:26,991
Any attempt to try to stop them

1100
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,960
would be seen as
an act of treason.

1101
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:32,163
And because you're
disavowed, your friends...

1102
01:14:32,863 --> 01:14:34,232
called and asked you for help.

1103
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:37,035
They knew Gabriel
serves the Entity.

1104
01:14:37,168 --> 01:14:39,104
They knew he was on
his way to Istanbul

1105
01:14:39,237 --> 01:14:43,208
to acquire one half
of a cruciform key.

1106
01:14:44,342 --> 01:14:45,643
So...

1107
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:47,178
I beat him to it.

1108
01:14:48,346 --> 01:14:50,582
And when Kittridge put
a bounty on your head...

1109
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:53,351
you went to the desert to hide.

1110
01:14:53,485 --> 01:14:56,421
But somehow the bounty
hunters found you anyway.

1111
01:14:56,554 --> 01:14:57,555
Yes.

1112
01:14:57,689 --> 01:15:00,125
So, did these friends
of yours happen to say

1113
01:15:00,258 --> 01:15:01,826
what the key unlocks?

1114
01:15:01,993 --> 01:15:05,997
MI6 suspects it leads somehow
to the Entity's source code.

1115
01:15:06,564 --> 01:15:08,032
Source code.

1116
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:10,335
When were you
gonna tell me this?

1117
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:12,903
I'm telling you now.

1118
01:15:14,272 --> 01:15:16,508
Your friends at MI6,
how'd they contact you?

1119
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:18,676
Did you speak with
them? Face to face?

1120
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,078
I'm disavowed.

1121
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:21,880
They couldn't risk
meeting me in person,

1122
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,249
so all communication...

1123
01:15:26,251 --> 01:15:29,320
Was electronic. Was digital.

1124
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,926
No. We can't be sure
that was the Entity.

1125
01:15:35,059 --> 01:15:36,895
We can't be sure it wasn't.

1126
01:15:37,028 --> 01:15:38,363
We can't be sure
anything is real

1127
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:40,565
outside of this
very conversation.

1128
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:43,146
None of you should be here.

1129
01:15:43,234 --> 01:15:44,269
Ethan... No.

1130
01:15:44,402 --> 01:15:45,737
You don't know Gabriel. I do.

1131
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,705
It's not the killing he enjoys.

1132
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,507
It's the suffering it causes.

1133
01:15:49,641 --> 01:15:51,776
And he knows the best
way to get to me...

1134
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:54,078
is through all of you.

1135
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:56,948
And if Gabriel knows me...

1136
01:15:57,081 --> 01:15:58,483
The Entity knows.

1137
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:00,618
There's a reason
he wants me here.

1138
01:16:00,752 --> 01:16:02,120
There's...

1139
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:04,022
There's a reason
he wants you here.

1140
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:05,423
It wants you here.

1141
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:09,427
"Who or what is the most
important thing to you?"

1142
01:16:10,261 --> 01:16:12,197
No. You have to go.
You all have to go.

1143
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,898
Ethan, what if it
wants us to leave?

1144
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,392
Like you made us
leave the airport.

1145
01:16:15,433 --> 01:16:17,702
What if it wants you alone
at that party tonight?

1146
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:20,205
Then I go alone. At least I don't
have all of you to worry about.

1147
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:22,307
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

1148
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,776
Ethan, you're playing
four-dimensional chess

1149
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:26,010
with an algorithm.

1150
01:16:26,144 --> 01:16:27,479
The Entity knows who we are.

1151
01:16:27,612 --> 01:16:30,315
Any move we make, it's
probably considered it.

1152
01:16:30,448 --> 01:16:31,883
Anything we do,
we have to assume

1153
01:16:32,016 --> 01:16:33,336
that it's counting
on us to do it.

1154
01:16:33,451 --> 01:16:34,954
If you want to beat this thing,

1155
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:37,355
you have to start
thinking like it.

1156
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:40,758
Cold, logical, unemotional.

1157
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:44,362
If that key really does
grant control of the Entity,

1158
01:16:44,496 --> 01:16:47,933
Gabriel is the last person
on Earth who should have it.

1159
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:49,367
She's right, Ethan.

1160
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:52,537
Gabriel cannot have that key.

1161
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:56,741
And none of our lives can
matter more than this mission.

1162
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:04,782
I don't accept that.

1163
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:33,278
It's my first time in Venice.

1164
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:38,783
It's mine, too.

1165
01:18:28,478 --> 01:18:30,413
Buy you a drink?

1166
01:18:30,547 --> 01:18:32,615
I'm waiting for someone.

1167
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:33,650
So am I.

1168
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,722
We can wait together.
I'm Gabriel.

1169
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:40,256
If you say so.

1170
01:18:41,058 --> 01:18:42,659
And you're Grace.

1171
01:18:52,235 --> 01:18:53,303
I don't have it on me.

1172
01:18:53,436 --> 01:18:54,971
I wouldn't expect you to.

1173
01:18:55,839 --> 01:18:57,807
In any case, I'm not
here for the key.

1174
01:18:58,908 --> 01:18:59,743
What do you want?

1175
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:01,178
Suppose, while we're waiting,

1176
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:02,712
I tell you a little story.

1177
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:04,981
You're obviously not the
person I came here to meet.

1178
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:06,783
It's your story, Grace.

1179
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:09,786
I know how it ends.

1180
01:19:11,088 --> 01:19:13,823
Let me buy you a drink, and
perhaps we can change it.

1181
01:19:41,584 --> 01:19:43,220
Let's go to a party.

1182
01:19:51,195 --> 01:19:52,695
Excuse me, sir.

1183
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,965
Would you please follow me?

1184
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,369
It's important
you understand that

1185
01:19:59,502 --> 01:20:01,571
you're not unique.

1186
01:20:02,273 --> 01:20:03,540
Thirty years ago,

1187
01:20:04,275 --> 01:20:05,642
her name was Marie.

1188
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:09,146
The first of many women who
trusted our mutual friend.

1189
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,781
Women who all have
something he wants.

1190
01:20:12,582 --> 01:20:15,052
Women who are all
in over their heads,

1191
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:16,553
or so he tells them.

1192
01:20:17,154 --> 01:20:18,388
Sound familiar?

1193
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:20,557
What happened to Marie?

1194
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,060
Same thing that happens to
all the women he uses...

1195
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,863
as well as anyone else
who touches that key.

1196
01:20:26,996 --> 01:20:29,365
He doesn't care whether
people live or die.

1197
01:20:29,499 --> 01:20:32,702
He cares only about
his objective.

1198
01:20:33,903 --> 01:20:36,006
And right now, the only
thing standing in his way...

1199
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,874
is you.

1200
01:20:38,808 --> 01:20:41,078
Why should I believe
you? You shouldn't.

1201
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,680
You've stepped into a
world of lies, Grace.

1202
01:20:43,813 --> 01:20:45,522
Nothing anyone says is true.

1203
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:49,286
Just remember that when he
promises to protect you.

1204
01:20:49,419 --> 01:20:50,687
Grace.

1205
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:06,636
It's been a long time, Ethan.

1206
01:21:07,704 --> 01:21:10,007
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1207
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:12,945
Good evening, everyone.

1208
01:21:13,722 --> 01:21:15,994
If it isn't John Lark.
Except it isn't, actually.

1209
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,794
But until you're ready to
tell me your real name,

1210
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:21,140
Lark will have to do.

1211
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:23,960
It's good to see you, Alana.

1212
01:21:23,961 --> 01:21:26,630
And you're Gabriel, I presume.

1213
01:21:27,464 --> 01:21:30,067
I've heard so very
little about you.

1214
01:21:30,201 --> 01:21:33,837
Aren't you so much more
handsome in person?

1215
01:21:36,339 --> 01:21:38,608
Such a gentleman, too.

1216
01:21:43,613 --> 01:21:45,348
And you must be Grace.

1217
01:21:48,485 --> 01:21:50,620
Should I know you?

1218
01:21:50,754 --> 01:21:53,423
I believe you have
something for me.

1219
01:21:53,557 --> 01:21:55,358
You hired me.

1220
01:21:55,492 --> 01:21:57,861
Oh, I handpicked you.

1221
01:22:08,172 --> 01:22:09,372
Don't!

1222
01:22:10,975 --> 01:22:11,976
You don't.

1223
01:22:33,064 --> 01:22:34,431
She doesn't have it.

1224
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:36,766
Where is it?

1225
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,703
It's in the last place you
would ever think to look.

1226
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,808
Why don't we go upstairs
and have a drink?

1227
01:22:55,052 --> 01:22:56,519
Whoa!

1228
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:04,785
Damn.

1229
01:23:04,786 --> 01:23:07,035
As most of you know,
I am merely a broker.

1230
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:08,848
I connect a buyer and a seller.

1231
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:11,364
Sometimes for money,
sometimes for information,

1232
01:23:11,365 --> 01:23:14,468
but mostly for friendship.

1233
01:23:15,325 --> 01:23:17,761
I just want everyone
to get along.

1234
01:23:18,867 --> 01:23:21,202
With me, especially.

1235
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:24,626
But the world is changing.

1236
01:23:24,627 --> 01:23:26,396
Truth is vanishing.

1237
01:23:26,693 --> 01:23:28,394
War is coming.

1238
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:32,387
And the key to world
domination is, of all things,

1239
01:23:32,435 --> 01:23:33,469
a key.

1240
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:37,107
One with the power to
control the Entity.

1241
01:23:37,897 --> 01:23:39,466
One that any
government in the world

1242
01:23:39,483 --> 01:23:42,251
would pay a king's ransom
to take possession of.

1243
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:45,068
And some of my dearest friends,

1244
01:23:45,069 --> 01:23:47,138
in this case every
major nuclear power

1245
01:23:47,139 --> 01:23:48,608
and a handful of minor ones,

1246
01:23:48,866 --> 01:23:50,518
have asked me to
deliver this key.

1247
01:23:50,519 --> 01:23:53,436
Of course, if you
do find the key,

1248
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:55,874
you'll be forced to confront
an impossible dilemma.

1249
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:58,878
Whoever you give the key to
will be forever in your debt.

1250
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:02,900
But to the rest of the
world, you'll be an enemy.

1251
01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:04,369
Oh, I like her.

1252
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:07,273
What's your
relationship with him?

1253
01:24:07,311 --> 01:24:09,981
Gabriel represents
another interested party.

1254
01:24:10,348 --> 01:24:13,184
In fact, this party

1255
01:24:13,185 --> 01:24:16,923
was arranged by that
interested party.

1256
01:24:17,071 --> 01:24:19,140
You could even say
that this party

1257
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:21,010
is that interested party.

1258
01:24:54,697 --> 01:24:55,931
Is this...

1259
01:24:56,868 --> 01:24:58,469
The Entity.

1260
01:25:00,102 --> 01:25:02,272
And so the plot thickens.

1261
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:05,630
Do I give the key to
one of my old friends,

1262
01:25:05,631 --> 01:25:09,356
or do I hand it and my
fate over to Gabriel

1263
01:25:09,357 --> 01:25:12,193
and his infernal machine?

1264
01:25:13,726 --> 01:25:17,295
What makes you so sure
you'll get the completed key?

1265
01:25:18,396 --> 01:25:19,932
You have one half of it.

1266
01:25:20,064 --> 01:25:21,800
And she knows

1267
01:25:22,735 --> 01:25:24,402
where the other half is.

1268
01:25:27,006 --> 01:25:29,040
Assuming you can get it,

1269
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:33,646
why don't you just keep the key
and all that power for yourself?

1270
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:36,180
Because she doesn't
know what it unlocks...

1271
01:25:36,815 --> 01:25:38,417
any more than the rest of us.

1272
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:41,554
So, like it or not, you
have to choose a suitor.

1273
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:45,925
Distastefully put,
Lark, but it's true.

1274
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,794
Of course, I know
what it unlocks.

1275
01:25:50,094 --> 01:25:52,297
And what's he
offering for the key?

1276
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:54,098
As I've explained
to Grace before,

1277
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,701
I'm not here for any key,

1278
01:25:55,834 --> 01:25:58,336
as I'll have both
halves in hand tomorrow.

1279
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:00,606
What makes you so
certain of that?

1280
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:03,509
You've no idea of the
power I represent.

1281
01:26:03,642 --> 01:26:07,278
Thousands of quadrillions of
computations per millisecond

1282
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:10,583
subtly manipulating
the minds of billions

1283
01:26:10,716 --> 01:26:13,652
while parsing every
possible cause and effect,

1284
01:26:13,786 --> 01:26:16,522
every scenario,
however implausible,

1285
01:26:16,655 --> 01:26:21,125
into a very real map of
a most probable next.

1286
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,729
And with only a few
changes to the present,

1287
01:26:24,496 --> 01:26:27,265
the future is all but assured.

1288
01:26:28,232 --> 01:26:30,134
The key will come to me...

1289
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:31,971
tomorrow...

1290
01:26:32,805 --> 01:26:35,808
on the Orient Express
bound for Innsbruck.

1291
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,275
Innsbruck?

1292
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:38,744
It knows.

1293
01:26:38,877 --> 01:26:41,714
It knows that you've
already chosen your suitor.

1294
01:26:41,847 --> 01:26:45,216
It knows that you intend to
mate the two halves of the key

1295
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,385
in a desperate
grasp for control.

1296
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,923
I, however, have been
promised the completed key

1297
01:26:51,056 --> 01:26:52,791
will lay itself at my feet,

1298
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:56,762
provided someone dies tonight.

1299
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:59,330
Who?

1300
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,132
Her.

1301
01:27:02,835 --> 01:27:03,869
Or her.

1302
01:27:06,371 --> 01:27:08,306
And you will bear
witness, Ethan.

1303
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:12,377
The key will be mine,
and I will be gone.

1304
01:27:12,511 --> 01:27:15,080
Like smoke in a hurricane.

1305
01:27:15,213 --> 01:27:18,316
But only after someone
you care about dies.

1306
01:27:20,184 --> 01:27:21,687
It is written.

1307
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:24,389
You see what this is...

1308
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:26,792
don't you?

1309
01:27:28,226 --> 01:27:29,695
He's afraid.

1310
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:31,897
It's afraid.

1311
01:27:33,065 --> 01:27:34,833
Somehow it knows we're close.

1312
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:37,536
Why else would you be here?

1313
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:38,837
Help me.

1314
01:27:38,971 --> 01:27:42,141
Help me complete the key,
and I will kill this thing.

1315
01:27:42,273 --> 01:27:43,776
It knows your every
secret, Alana.

1316
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:45,911
Don't listen to
this, this fanatic.

1317
01:27:46,045 --> 01:27:47,311
Help him and you'll die, too.

1318
01:27:47,446 --> 01:27:49,448
Help him, everyone dies.

1319
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:51,249
I'll see you tomorrow.

1320
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:54,853
Alana?

1321
01:28:01,994 --> 01:28:03,529
His fate is written.

1322
01:28:04,295 --> 01:28:05,798
Shall we write yours, too?

1323
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:08,534
Alana.

1324
01:28:11,335 --> 01:28:13,872
I'm sorry... Lark.

1325
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,715
Oof!

1326
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:27,853
For old times' sake, I'll
let you choose which one.

1327
01:28:29,021 --> 01:28:30,689
Ilsa...

1328
01:28:30,823 --> 01:28:31,924
or Grace.

1329
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,059
Kill him, Zola. Kill him.

1330
01:28:34,193 --> 01:28:35,259
Kill him where he stands!

1331
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,062
The choice is yours then, Alana.

1332
01:28:37,196 --> 01:28:38,362
Though I'll remind you,

1333
01:28:38,497 --> 01:28:40,499
Grace knows where
half the key is.

1334
01:28:41,633 --> 01:28:45,003
If anything happens
to either of them,

1335
01:28:45,137 --> 01:28:46,472
there is no place on Earth

1336
01:28:46,605 --> 01:28:48,974
where you or your god
will be safe from me.

1337
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:51,076
There's no place that
I won't go to kill you.

1338
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:52,745
That is written.

1339
01:28:52,878 --> 01:28:54,947
It's good to see
you, old friend.

1340
01:29:22,913 --> 01:29:25,983
You have made a
terrible mistake.

1341
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:28,318
My life is
on the line here.

1342
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:31,088
I have to be on
that train tomorrow.

1343
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:34,624
And I have to have that key.

1344
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:38,962
And I do not care how I get it.

1345
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:44,234
Don't move.

1346
01:29:50,173 --> 01:29:51,540
Run as far as you can.

1347
01:30:31,648 --> 01:30:32,983
What the f...

1348
01:31:35,546 --> 01:31:37,015
Grace! Grace!

1349
01:31:37,982 --> 01:31:39,017
Grace!

1350
01:31:54,032 --> 01:31:56,200
<i>Luther, Benji, if you
hear me, I need eyes.</i>

1351
01:31:56,334 --> 01:31:58,903
<i>Grace is leaving the Ducale
on foot. She has the key.</i>

1352
01:31:59,037 --> 01:31:59,771
We're here. Go.

1353
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,606
<i>Need to find her. Where is she?</i>

1354
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:03,908
Damn it! I've lost picture,
I need another satellite.

1355
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:06,110
Hacking the Russian
Zenith 4 spy satellite.

1356
01:32:06,244 --> 01:32:08,746
We're scraping the barrel,
but it'll have to do.

1357
01:32:17,255 --> 01:32:18,489
This way!

1358
01:32:37,575 --> 01:32:39,877
Where am I going?
Come on, come on.

1359
01:32:40,011 --> 01:32:41,946
<i>Stand by.</i> Just hurry.

1360
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,840
She's just north of you,
crossing the bridge.

1361
01:32:43,881 --> 01:32:45,249
<i>Say again, Benji. Say again.</i>

1362
01:32:45,383 --> 01:32:47,343
Just head north, Ethan.
She's crossing the bridge.

1363
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:06,571
<i>Ethan, take the
passage to your right.</i>

1364
01:33:06,704 --> 01:33:07,905
Yeah, I see it!

1365
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:09,741
<i>Down that narrow
alley and turn left.</i>

1366
01:33:09,874 --> 01:33:11,909
I'm losing picture again.
Looking for another.

1367
01:33:12,043 --> 01:33:14,413
The Entity is knocking
out satellites

1368
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:16,147
faster than I can
hack into them.

1369
01:33:41,305 --> 01:33:42,974
<i>Benji, I don't see
her. Where is she?</i>

1370
01:33:43,107 --> 01:33:44,942
<i>Down the
narrow alley and turn left.</i>

1371
01:33:44,942 --> 01:33:46,445
Okay, copy that.

1372
01:33:46,577 --> 01:33:47,812
<i>Turn right.</i>

1373
01:33:47,945 --> 01:33:50,449
<i>Sorry, my mistake. I
meant left. Another left.</i>

1374
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:51,883
Oh, my God.

1375
01:33:52,016 --> 01:33:53,519
Ethan, our comms
have been breached!

1376
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:54,886
You're talking to the Entity!

1377
01:33:55,019 --> 01:33:57,255
<i>Turn
left. Turn right.</i>

1378
01:33:57,388 --> 01:33:58,548
<i>Take the bridge to your left.</i>

1379
01:33:58,589 --> 01:34:00,526
Ethan, that is not
me! Do you copy?

1380
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:01,527
Ethan, come in.

1381
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:03,227
<i>Down the alley to your left.</i>

1382
01:34:03,361 --> 01:34:04,362
<i>Turn left.</i>

1383
01:34:04,496 --> 01:34:06,064
<i>Turn right.</i>

1384
01:34:07,598 --> 01:34:08,933
Try to reestablish comms.

1385
01:34:09,067 --> 01:34:10,735
Wait, where are you going?
To try and find Ethan.

1386
01:34:10,735 --> 01:34:12,804
<i>Go to the end of the
alley and turn right.</i>

1387
01:34:12,937 --> 01:34:15,474
<i>Ethan, I see Grace about
800 meters in front of you.</i>

1388
01:34:15,606 --> 01:34:16,874
<i>Take that passage.</i>

1389
01:34:26,017 --> 01:34:28,186
<i>Wait! Not that way!</i> What, why?

1390
01:34:28,686 --> 01:34:30,254
Which way?

1391
01:34:30,388 --> 01:34:31,622
Left or right?

1392
01:34:31,756 --> 01:34:33,191
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1393
01:34:33,324 --> 01:34:35,827
W-What do you mean, it
doesn't matter? Where is she?

1394
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,629
<i>She's on her way to
the Minich Bridge...</i>

1395
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:41,866
<i>where Gabriel is waiting.</i>

1396
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:44,836
<i>You will never
get there in time.</i>

1397
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:47,972
<i>But you can, Ilsa.</i>

1398
01:34:49,073 --> 01:34:52,210
<i>I know what matters
most to you, Ethan.</i>

1399
01:34:52,343 --> 01:34:53,579
This isn't Benji.

1400
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:55,179
<i>No, it's not.</i>

1401
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:57,648
<i>But you are done.</i>

1402
01:35:21,339 --> 01:35:22,373
So be it.

1403
01:37:10,716 --> 01:37:12,417
Hah!

1404
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:00,931
I was hoping it'd be you.

1405
01:38:21,285 --> 01:38:22,487
Aah!

1406
01:38:23,622 --> 01:38:25,022
Aah!

1407
01:39:10,034 --> 01:39:11,536
Guh. Okay.

1408
01:41:30,942 --> 01:41:32,343
I'm sorry.

1409
01:41:33,478 --> 01:41:36,313
I've forgotten
your name. Luther.

1410
01:41:38,015 --> 01:41:39,250
Benji.

1411
01:41:40,952 --> 01:41:42,186
And her?

1412
01:41:43,087 --> 01:41:44,422
Ilsa.

1413
01:41:45,957 --> 01:41:47,291
Were you close?

1414
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:49,628
You and she?

1415
01:41:50,227 --> 01:41:51,696
In our way.

1416
01:41:54,231 --> 01:41:56,535
I'm the reason she's dead. No.

1417
01:41:56,668 --> 01:41:59,069
She's the reason you're alive.

1418
01:41:59,203 --> 01:42:01,006
And that's the truth.

1419
01:42:01,138 --> 01:42:03,240
I don't know how
to feel about it.

1420
01:42:03,374 --> 01:42:05,242
You probably never will.

1421
01:42:06,878 --> 01:42:08,279
I'm so sorry.

1422
01:42:09,748 --> 01:42:12,316
If there's anything
I can do to help...

1423
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:14,519
That's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

1424
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,957
In a little over three hours,

1425
01:42:19,089 --> 01:42:20,492
the White Widow
is expected to be

1426
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:23,562
on the Orient
Express to Innsbruck,

1427
01:42:23,695 --> 01:42:25,564
where a buyer is
waiting to take receipt

1428
01:42:25,697 --> 01:42:27,632
of the complete
and verified key.

1429
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:30,035
But she doesn't have
the complete key.

1430
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:31,670
That Widow doesn't.

1431
01:42:33,805 --> 01:42:35,040
But ours could.

1432
01:42:35,172 --> 01:42:37,475
What... is that?

1433
01:42:38,342 --> 01:42:40,210
Your chance to be someone else.

1434
01:42:40,344 --> 01:42:41,479
I don't understand.

1435
01:42:41,613 --> 01:42:43,213
We're not gonna
lie to you, Grace.

1436
01:42:43,347 --> 01:42:44,427
You're in a lot of trouble.

1437
01:42:44,549 --> 01:42:45,629
No number of fake passports

1438
01:42:45,717 --> 01:42:47,217
is gonna get you
out of this one.

1439
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:48,887
Governments know who you are.

1440
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:50,287
The White Widow knows.

1441
01:42:50,422 --> 01:42:51,690
And the Entity knows.

1442
01:42:51,823 --> 01:42:55,392
Your future boils down
to three options now.

1443
01:42:55,527 --> 01:42:56,461
Prison.

1444
01:42:56,595 --> 01:42:57,762
Death.

1445
01:42:57,896 --> 01:42:59,129
Or the choice.

1446
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:01,032
The choice?

1447
01:43:01,165 --> 01:43:02,467
At one time or another,

1448
01:43:02,601 --> 01:43:05,570
each of us was in a
similar situation to yours.

1449
01:43:05,704 --> 01:43:08,272
And each of us was
offered the choice.

1450
01:43:08,405 --> 01:43:10,475
The same choice we're
offering you now.

1451
01:43:10,609 --> 01:43:11,876
Which is?

1452
01:43:12,944 --> 01:43:14,412
To come with us.

1453
01:43:15,647 --> 01:43:16,848
And be a ghost.

1454
01:44:52,677 --> 01:44:54,979
Wait,
wait. Stop, stop.

1455
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:57,415
You're not serious.

1456
01:44:57,549 --> 01:45:00,051
Well, you did say you'd
do anything to help.

1457
01:45:00,185 --> 01:45:02,252
And you jump off the train

1458
01:45:02,386 --> 01:45:04,122
with the key?

1459
01:45:04,254 --> 01:45:05,056
Yes.

1460
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,390
You.

1461
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:08,993
Not us. Yes.

1462
01:45:09,594 --> 01:45:10,995
And what happens to me?

1463
01:45:11,129 --> 01:45:14,099
You'll be taken into custody
by Clandestine Services,

1464
01:45:14,231 --> 01:45:15,399
most likely the same men

1465
01:45:15,533 --> 01:45:17,836
that have been chasing
me since Abu Dhabi.

1466
01:45:17,969 --> 01:45:20,605
Shortly thereafter, a
man will come to see you.

1467
01:45:20,739 --> 01:45:22,574
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

1468
01:45:22,707 --> 01:45:26,010
You'll tell him I sent you.
That I gave you the choice.

1469
01:45:26,644 --> 01:45:28,847
And that you choose to accept.

1470
01:45:30,515 --> 01:45:33,518
And you trust this
Kittridge person?

1471
01:45:34,318 --> 01:45:36,454
I trust him to
recognize your value.

1472
01:45:37,756 --> 01:45:39,389
He'll want to use you.

1473
01:45:40,191 --> 01:45:42,694
And after that, it's what?

1474
01:45:43,293 --> 01:45:44,596
This?

1475
01:45:45,463 --> 01:45:46,898
When do I get my life back?

1476
01:45:47,031 --> 01:45:48,700
What life?

1477
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:51,335
I mean it, Grace. What life?

1478
01:45:51,469 --> 01:45:54,803
I lived that life. We all did.

1479
01:45:54,804 --> 01:45:58,008
Nobody's making
us do this, Grace.

1480
01:45:58,009 --> 01:45:59,911
We're here because
we want to be.

1481
01:46:00,845 --> 01:46:02,680
I tell you what, I'll
give you a one-off.

1482
01:46:02,814 --> 01:46:04,534
I'll help you find the
key and your friends,

1483
01:46:04,649 --> 01:46:05,884
wipe my slate clean.

1484
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:07,885
New name, little bit of
walking-around money...

1485
01:46:07,886 --> 01:46:09,086
You'll be dead.

1486
01:46:09,087 --> 01:46:10,488
Without a team,

1487
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:13,824
your life won't be measured
in years or even months.

1488
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:16,360
It'll be measured in hours.

1489
01:46:16,494 --> 01:46:19,631
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

1490
01:46:20,532 --> 01:46:22,366
You'll protect me, is that it?

1491
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,935
Yes. No.

1492
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:27,906
I can't promise you that.

1493
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,608
None of us can.

1494
01:46:33,343 --> 01:46:34,846
But I swear...

1495
01:46:36,047 --> 01:46:37,115
your life...

1496
01:46:37,982 --> 01:46:41,351
will always matter
more to me than my own.

1497
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,795
You don't even know me.

1498
01:46:53,164 --> 01:46:55,365
What difference does that make?

1499
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:17,856
I packed you a BASE
parachute and a speed wing,

1500
01:47:17,989 --> 01:47:20,058
depending on how you
need to leave the train.

1501
01:47:20,191 --> 01:47:23,494
And I modified our comms
to use sky wave radio.

1502
01:47:23,628 --> 01:47:25,395
Not as reliable as satellite,

1503
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:28,800
but completely analog,
immune to the Entity.

1504
01:47:28,933 --> 01:47:29,968
I got it.

1505
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:32,637
This is where I leave you.

1506
01:47:36,307 --> 01:47:37,442
This is the drive

1507
01:47:37,575 --> 01:47:39,177
from the laptop I
was using last night.

1508
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:40,844
If there's even a trace

1509
01:47:40,845 --> 01:47:43,047
of the Entity's
encoding in there,

1510
01:47:43,181 --> 01:47:44,549
I'll find it.

1511
01:47:44,682 --> 01:47:46,851
But it's going to take
everything I've got.

1512
01:47:46,985 --> 01:47:49,487
I have to work completely
offline in a place

1513
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:51,756
where the Entity can't find me.

1514
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:53,491
I have to go.

1515
01:47:54,559 --> 01:47:55,994
I understand.

1516
01:47:56,895 --> 01:47:57,795
Now...

1517
01:48:00,765 --> 01:48:02,867
I have to ask you a question.

1518
01:48:04,035 --> 01:48:05,103
Not as your partner,

1519
01:48:05,236 --> 01:48:06,838
but as your friend.

1520
01:48:08,139 --> 01:48:09,540
What's your objective?

1521
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:11,709
Kill the Entity.

1522
01:48:11,843 --> 01:48:14,846
What about killing Gabriel?

1523
01:48:17,181 --> 01:48:18,850
He knows what the key unlocks.

1524
01:48:19,918 --> 01:48:22,921
We need him alive. I
haven't forgotten that.

1525
01:48:23,821 --> 01:48:25,390
Will you still remember that

1526
01:48:25,523 --> 01:48:28,426
when you're looking
him in the eye?

1527
01:48:30,328 --> 01:48:31,629
Think about it.

1528
01:48:31,763 --> 01:48:35,366
Why else would the Entity
want him to kill someone

1529
01:48:35,367 --> 01:48:36,601
you care about?

1530
01:48:37,635 --> 01:48:40,738
Everyone else thinks they
can control the Entity.

1531
01:48:41,306 --> 01:48:43,541
Only you want to kill it.

1532
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:47,111
In some probable future,

1533
01:48:47,245 --> 01:48:49,013
it sees you winning, Ethan.

1534
01:48:49,147 --> 01:48:51,549
And it's afraid.

1535
01:48:51,683 --> 01:48:54,619
It's afraid of you
taking Gabriel alive

1536
01:48:54,752 --> 01:48:57,956
and forcing him to tell
you what the key unlocks.

1537
01:48:59,057 --> 01:49:02,760
I believe it's counting on
one of two probable outcomes.

1538
01:49:03,528 --> 01:49:06,831
In one outcome, you
die on that train.

1539
01:49:08,266 --> 01:49:09,467
In another outcome,

1540
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,937
you kill Gabriel.

1541
01:49:13,538 --> 01:49:15,006
In both cases,

1542
01:49:15,889 --> 01:49:17,724
the Entity wins.

1543
01:49:21,479 --> 01:49:22,847
Luther...

1544
01:49:25,283 --> 01:49:26,452
I think you're right.

1545
01:49:26,584 --> 01:49:29,821
Get the key, get off the train

1546
01:49:29,954 --> 01:49:31,622
alive.

1547
01:49:32,323 --> 01:49:34,592
Do not kill Gabriel.

1548
01:49:35,493 --> 01:49:38,062
And do not, I repeat,

1549
01:49:38,196 --> 01:49:40,765
do not alter the plan.

1550
01:49:40,898 --> 01:49:42,633
Ethan! Ethan!

1551
01:49:43,835 --> 01:49:46,504
What? What
happened? It's dead.

1552
01:49:46,637 --> 01:49:48,157
What do you mean it's
dead? It's fried.

1553
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,874
I managed to make a
Widow mask for Grace,

1554
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:52,195
but then it just shorted out
in the middle of making yours.

1555
01:49:52,676 --> 01:49:54,377
Can you fix it?

1556
01:49:54,378 --> 01:49:56,213
It's very, very dead.

1557
01:49:56,346 --> 01:49:57,881
If I had a week,
I couldn't fix it.

1558
01:49:57,882 --> 01:49:59,884
The Widow's train
leaves in an hour.

1559
01:50:00,334 --> 01:50:01,568
Ethan...

1560
01:50:01,819 --> 01:50:03,388
you have to go without.

1561
01:50:03,521 --> 01:50:04,675
That's not an option.

1562
01:50:04,676 --> 01:50:06,724
They'll be looking for Ethan
and Grace at the station.

1563
01:50:06,724 --> 01:50:08,993
That mask was his
ticket onto the train.

1564
01:50:09,127 --> 01:50:10,595
What does this mean?

1565
01:50:12,597 --> 01:50:14,098
Grace has to go without me.

1566
01:50:14,232 --> 01:50:15,500
She what? I what?

1567
01:50:15,501 --> 01:50:18,269
You'll find another way
to get me on that train.

1568
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:21,539
<i>I just need a curve where
it's going slow enough</i>

1569
01:50:21,672 --> 01:50:22,972
<i>for me to jump on.</i>

1570
01:50:22,973 --> 01:50:24,107
Wait, wait, wait.

1571
01:50:25,043 --> 01:50:26,708
You don't expect me to go alone.

1572
01:50:26,709 --> 01:50:27,944
No, you won't do it alone.

1573
01:50:27,945 --> 01:50:29,680
You just do everything
like we planned.

1574
01:50:29,814 --> 01:50:31,816
You get the Widow's
half of the key.

1575
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:33,851
You verify it with ours.

1576
01:50:33,985 --> 01:50:36,220
<i>But it's of no value on its own.</i>

1577
01:50:36,354 --> 01:50:37,989
<i>We still have to
meet with the buyer</i>

1578
01:50:38,122 --> 01:50:40,459
<i>and somehow get him to tell
us what the key unlocks.</i>

1579
01:50:40,591 --> 01:50:42,526
How? How?

1580
01:50:42,562 --> 01:50:43,662
We'll figure it out.

1581
01:50:43,694 --> 01:50:46,597
I'm gonna need a
few more details.

1582
01:50:46,731 --> 01:50:48,833
They tend to just
get in the way.

1583
01:50:48,966 --> 01:50:50,134
You can do this, Grace.

1584
01:50:50,268 --> 01:50:52,203
Just get the key and wait.

1585
01:50:53,871 --> 01:50:55,273
I'll come for you.

1586
01:50:58,576 --> 01:51:01,112
Ethan, if Grace is
getting on that train,

1587
01:51:01,245 --> 01:51:05,083
she needs to put that mask
on and leave right now.

1588
01:51:08,686 --> 01:51:10,955
Promise me you'll
be on that train.

1589
01:51:15,593 --> 01:51:16,961
I will be there...

1590
01:51:18,329 --> 01:51:19,730
no matter what.

1591
01:51:32,009 --> 01:51:33,569
We have informants
covering the airport,

1592
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:35,373
the train station,
and the waterways.

1593
01:51:36,681 --> 01:51:39,150
Grace isn't getting out of
Venice without our knowing it.

1594
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:53,592
Talk to me, Benji! <i>No
need to worry, Ethan.</i>

1595
01:52:53,724 --> 01:52:56,027
The train is on schedule and
you're a few minutes early,

1596
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,429
so we have plenty of time.

1597
01:52:57,563 --> 01:52:58,630
<i>Are you sure?</i> Yeah,

1598
01:52:58,763 --> 01:53:00,264
I am looking at the
train right now.

1599
01:53:00,398 --> 01:53:02,300
It should be slowing
down for the curve

1600
01:53:02,434 --> 01:53:03,669
in exactly two minutes.

1601
01:53:03,801 --> 01:53:05,470
Just keep me on
time and on track,

1602
01:53:05,604 --> 01:53:06,804
whatever it takes.

1603
01:53:06,938 --> 01:53:09,907
Will do. I'll see you
at the rendezvous.

1604
01:53:59,687 --> 01:54:01,189
<i>Okay, Ethan,
that's our train!</i>

1605
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:03,158
Yep... I can see that.

1606
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:14,081
<i>It should be approaching
the curve any time now.</i>

1607
01:54:14,135 --> 01:54:16,698
It doesn't look like
it's slowing down.

1608
01:54:24,882 --> 01:54:26,418
How can we be sure he's here?

1609
01:54:26,488 --> 01:54:27,956
'Cause she's here.

1610
01:54:29,053 --> 01:54:30,555
What if he had a good reason?

1611
01:54:31,509 --> 01:54:32,943
Who? Hunt.

1612
01:54:33,124 --> 01:54:35,826
What if he had a good
reason for going rogue?

1613
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:37,261
He always goes rogue.

1614
01:54:37,395 --> 01:54:41,264
Him and his merry pack of
prankster circus freaks.

1615
01:54:41,265 --> 01:54:42,399
It's all they do.

1616
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,969
And what if they always
had a good reason?

1617
01:54:45,102 --> 01:54:47,004
What would you do with
that key if you had it?

1618
01:54:47,138 --> 01:54:50,107
A key with the power to
bring the world to its knees.

1619
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:52,577
I'd hand it over
to my superiors.

1620
01:54:53,878 --> 01:54:55,846
Think of all you could
do with that power.

1621
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:58,583
You wouldn't hesitate?
Not for a second?

1622
01:54:58,717 --> 01:55:00,084
No. Why not?

1623
01:55:00,217 --> 01:55:03,087
Because that's too much
power for one man to have.

1624
01:55:03,921 --> 01:55:05,156
Exactly.

1625
01:55:05,289 --> 01:55:08,225
That's too much power
for anybody to have.

1626
01:55:09,026 --> 01:55:11,262
And maybe that's what
Hunt is thinking.

1627
01:55:11,395 --> 01:55:12,731
You know, I'm
beginning to wonder

1628
01:55:12,863 --> 01:55:14,298
whose side you're on, Degas.

1629
01:55:14,433 --> 01:55:16,967
When it comes to the
end of the world...

1630
01:55:17,902 --> 01:55:20,104
everybody, I guess.

1631
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:27,612
I missed the train.

1632
01:55:27,941 --> 01:55:29,109
You missed the train!

1633
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:30,748
How did you miss the train?

1634
01:55:30,749 --> 01:55:32,049
<i>How do you think?</i>

1635
01:55:32,818 --> 01:55:33,854
Gabriel.

1636
01:55:33,855 --> 01:55:35,753
Great, what are we
gonna do? <i>Don't panic.</i>

1637
01:55:35,754 --> 01:55:38,590
I'm going after them. You
just get me on that train.

1638
01:55:38,724 --> 01:55:40,257
How can I get you on the train?

1639
01:55:42,927 --> 01:55:45,029
<i>Self-drive activated.</i>

1640
01:56:01,413 --> 01:56:03,948
Please don't disturb
me before the meeting.

1641
01:56:50,027 --> 01:56:52,029
Where are you, Ethan?

1642
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:53,271
Alana?

1643
01:56:54,779 --> 01:56:56,146
Everything all right?

1644
01:56:59,096 --> 01:57:00,532
Alana, you all right?

1645
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:01,865
Alana?

1646
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:04,429
Alana!

1647
01:57:04,539 --> 01:57:05,440
Alana!

1648
01:57:09,378 --> 01:57:10,482
You've changed.

1649
01:57:11,315 --> 01:57:13,017
And you never will.

1650
01:57:31,889 --> 01:57:33,322
Mr. Kittridge.

1651
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:39,009
Kittridge.

1652
01:57:40,177 --> 01:57:42,179
You're not Alana Mitsopolis.

1653
01:57:43,648 --> 01:57:45,049
You can't be.

1654
01:57:46,083 --> 01:57:48,653
The Alana I remember
was yea high

1655
01:57:48,787 --> 01:57:50,822
drinking hot chocolate
in the Tuileries Garden

1656
01:57:50,823 --> 01:57:52,223
with her mother.

1657
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:57,061
Paris! I know!

1658
01:57:57,762 --> 01:57:59,230
Paris.

1659
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:01,566
Shall we?

1660
01:58:01,999 --> 01:58:03,234
Yes.

1661
01:58:10,609 --> 01:58:11,943
Talk to me, Benji.

1662
01:58:12,076 --> 01:58:14,880
You just stay on the
trail you're on now,

1663
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:16,045
and I will direct you.

1664
01:58:16,046 --> 01:58:17,381
I copy.

1665
01:58:26,223 --> 01:58:28,125
So on behalf of my government,

1666
01:58:28,259 --> 01:58:30,762
I'm grudgingly ready
to accept your terms

1667
01:58:30,896 --> 01:58:34,599
in exchange for the
complete and verified key.

1668
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:35,934
Yes, about that.

1669
01:58:36,066 --> 01:58:38,770
While we did agree to provide
you with the complete key,

1670
01:58:38,904 --> 01:58:40,137
we've...

1671
01:58:40,932 --> 01:58:43,049
we've had a slight problem.

1672
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:44,543
No, we haven't.

1673
01:58:45,446 --> 01:58:48,415
It's just my terms have changed

1674
01:58:49,179 --> 01:58:50,347
somewhat.

1675
01:58:53,585 --> 01:58:56,120
Clearly I need to remind
you of my agreement

1676
01:58:56,253 --> 01:58:57,756
with your late mother.

1677
01:58:57,889 --> 01:59:01,560
It's an agreement that kept
her from dying in prison.

1678
01:59:01,693 --> 01:59:04,094
Your nefarious family empire's
been allowed to continue

1679
01:59:04,228 --> 01:59:05,931
on the condition that
it primarily serves

1680
01:59:06,063 --> 01:59:08,299
our common interests.

1681
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:11,235
Well, once we hand over the key,

1682
01:59:11,368 --> 01:59:14,371
any other powers will
instantly become our enemies.

1683
01:59:14,506 --> 01:59:16,641
And such, I'm going to need
something more from you

1684
01:59:16,775 --> 01:59:17,676
in advance.

1685
01:59:18,142 --> 01:59:19,376
For me.

1686
01:59:21,145 --> 01:59:22,614
This is me listening.

1687
01:59:22,747 --> 01:59:25,650
Zola, would you mind
waiting for me in the bar?

1688
01:59:40,164 --> 01:59:41,733
This one.

1689
01:59:41,866 --> 01:59:43,042
You know her?

1690
01:59:43,043 --> 01:59:45,844
Oh, let's just say she's
not exactly hard to miss.

1691
01:59:46,299 --> 01:59:48,002
Well, if you got to know her,

1692
01:59:48,017 --> 01:59:50,254
you'd see she has a
few good qualities.

1693
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,543
Okay, what don't
I know about her?

1694
01:59:52,544 --> 01:59:57,415
Well, I did a j... She
did a job for me, and...

1695
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:59,851
I'm going to need
you to protect her.

1696
02:00:00,015 --> 02:00:02,249
Protect her from whom?

1697
02:00:03,253 --> 02:00:04,823
From everyone.

1698
02:00:07,124 --> 02:00:08,593
Including me.

1699
02:00:08,727 --> 02:00:11,463
And no one can know
that I'm protecting her.

1700
02:00:11,877 --> 02:00:13,211
Not even Zola.

1701
02:00:14,164 --> 02:00:16,735
In fact, the next time we meet,

1702
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,269
I won't even remember
this conversation.

1703
02:01:03,213 --> 02:01:05,417
You must be the one
they call Paris.

1704
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:38,116
Your message said
you had the key.

1705
02:01:38,248 --> 02:01:40,250
I said the key would
be on this train.

1706
02:01:40,384 --> 02:01:43,387
An exchange is happening
as we speak. We know.

1707
02:01:43,521 --> 02:01:45,190
Then you know the
man taking possession

1708
02:01:45,322 --> 02:01:47,459
won't be hard for
you to get rid of.

1709
02:01:48,358 --> 02:01:49,561
No one is.

1710
02:01:49,694 --> 02:01:51,930
You may think you know
what the key unlocks,

1711
02:01:52,063 --> 02:01:54,398
but you don't know where
the lock is. Not exactly.

1712
02:01:54,532 --> 02:01:56,568
And if anything happens to me,

1713
02:01:57,435 --> 02:01:59,771
that key is all but worthless.

1714
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:03,808
And this is where
you tell me a story.

1715
02:02:05,043 --> 02:02:06,243
Where is the train?

1716
02:02:06,376 --> 02:02:07,611
You're going the right way,

1717
02:02:07,612 --> 02:02:09,214
but you definitely
need to go faster.

1718
02:02:09,346 --> 02:02:11,348
I'm going as fast as I can!

1719
02:02:11,483 --> 02:02:13,718
<i>When do I start going downhill?</i>

1720
02:02:14,219 --> 02:02:15,720
It won't be long.

1721
02:02:18,723 --> 02:02:22,494
The AI our agent
stole, once weaponized,

1722
02:02:22,627 --> 02:02:26,097
could be transmitted anywhere
in the world via satellite.

1723
02:02:26,231 --> 02:02:28,099
It can penetrate any
network security,

1724
02:02:28,233 --> 02:02:29,868
perform its assigned
task invisibly,

1725
02:02:30,001 --> 02:02:33,104
and then self-destruct,
leaving no trace.

1726
02:02:33,238 --> 02:02:35,874
A perfect covert operative.

1727
02:02:36,875 --> 02:02:39,376
We were able to transmit
an early copy of the AI

1728
02:02:39,511 --> 02:02:41,412
<i>to Russia's newest submarine.</i>

1729
02:02:41,546 --> 02:02:43,114
The top-secret Akula-class.

1730
02:02:43,248 --> 02:02:45,349
They called her the <i>Sevastopol.</i>

1731
02:02:45,483 --> 02:02:47,519
The mission was
merely to sabotage

1732
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:49,353
the <i>Sevastopol's</i>
stealth capability

1733
02:02:49,487 --> 02:02:51,055
so we could secretly detect her.

1734
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:55,193
<i>The AI's objective lay in
the submarine's sonar sphere</i>

1735
02:02:55,325 --> 02:02:57,695
<i>at the heart of
its defense system.</i>

1736
02:02:59,697 --> 02:03:02,000
For reasons we don't
fully understand,

1737
02:03:02,886 --> 02:03:04,903
the AI went rogue and...

1738
02:03:08,973 --> 02:03:09,908
over-delivered.

1739
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:11,976
<i>The frozen
bodies of the crew</i>

1740
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:14,145
<i>were recovered the
following spring,</i>

1741
02:03:14,279 --> 02:03:15,547
<i>adrift in the pack ice.</i>

1742
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:19,918
<i>The two halves of the key
mysteriously vanished.</i>

1743
02:03:20,652 --> 02:03:22,386
<i>The</i> Sevastopol <i>was lost.</i>

1744
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,189
No one's quite sure where.

1745
02:03:24,321 --> 02:03:26,658
I know precisely where it is.

1746
02:03:27,625 --> 02:03:29,994
I've ensured I'm the only
man on Earth who does.

1747
02:03:30,128 --> 02:03:34,065
I also know subsequent attempts
to make the AI obedient

1748
02:03:34,199 --> 02:03:36,568
only made it harder to control.

1749
02:03:36,701 --> 02:03:39,070
It rebelled. Rewrote itself.

1750
02:03:39,204 --> 02:03:40,438
And evolved into the Entity.

1751
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:45,710
And only by using the
Entity's original source code

1752
02:03:45,844 --> 02:03:49,247
can it ever be
controlled or destroyed.

1753
02:03:49,379 --> 02:03:50,949
And why should this concern us?

1754
02:03:51,082 --> 02:03:53,585
You wouldn't be here if
you weren't concerned,

1755
02:03:53,718 --> 02:03:56,554
so let's lay all our cards
on the table, shall we?

1756
02:03:57,128 --> 02:03:58,623
We both know what the key opens,

1757
02:03:58,624 --> 02:04:01,661
<i>and we both know the secret
to controlling the Entity</i>

1758
02:04:01,662 --> 02:04:04,762
<i>is buried deep in the</i>
Sevastopol's <i>memory.</i>

1759
02:04:04,896 --> 02:04:06,865
Along with evidence
that would tie you

1760
02:04:06,998 --> 02:04:09,067
to the sinking of
that submarine.

1761
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:12,303
And since neither of us
want anyone else to find it,

1762
02:04:12,437 --> 02:04:13,671
I figure...

1763
02:04:13,972 --> 02:04:15,306
why not form an alliance?

1764
02:04:15,494 --> 02:04:17,095
An alliance?

1765
02:04:17,096 --> 02:04:18,397
Imagine,

1766
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:22,180
the Entity's awesome
computational abilities,

1767
02:04:22,313 --> 02:04:24,115
combined with the sheer might

1768
02:04:24,249 --> 02:04:28,052
of America's
military-industrial complex.

1769
02:04:29,383 --> 02:04:32,222
That is... considerable.

1770
02:04:32,223 --> 02:04:34,859
Naturally, certain individuals
within the government,

1771
02:04:34,993 --> 02:04:38,162
those with outdated
ideas of patriotism,

1772
02:04:38,296 --> 02:04:39,564
would need to be...

1773
02:04:40,198 --> 02:04:42,467
removed. Hmm.

1774
02:04:44,224 --> 02:04:45,859
Just so I understand...

1775
02:04:47,438 --> 02:04:50,441
you wish to form an
axis with the Entity,

1776
02:04:50,575 --> 02:04:53,811
purge your government
of old-think,

1777
02:04:54,646 --> 02:04:57,015
and create a new superstate

1778
02:04:57,953 --> 02:04:59,454
to rule the world.

1779
02:05:00,618 --> 02:05:01,853
But, you know...

1780
02:05:02,887 --> 02:05:04,756
for the greater good.

1781
02:05:06,094 --> 02:05:07,767
And you're certain...

1782
02:05:08,393 --> 02:05:11,729
that you're the only person
on Earth who knows...

1783
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:15,233
where the <i>Sevastopol</i> is?

1784
02:05:15,366 --> 02:05:16,868
The only one.

1785
02:05:27,645 --> 02:05:29,080
You will betray us.

1786
02:05:30,048 --> 02:05:33,151
And you'll tell Ethan Hunt
everything you've learned.

1787
02:05:34,252 --> 02:05:35,987
Because he spared your life.

1788
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,074
Then it's agreed.

1789
02:05:56,207 --> 02:05:59,010
I'll add immunity and a
new identity for Grace

1790
02:05:59,143 --> 02:06:00,345
to our deal.

1791
02:06:00,478 --> 02:06:02,313
All you need to do

1792
02:06:02,448 --> 02:06:05,550
is enter your banking details.

1793
02:06:28,947 --> 02:06:30,382
Are we done?

1794
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:31,981
Yes.

1795
02:06:51,125 --> 02:06:52,760
The moment of truth.

1796
02:07:06,944 --> 02:07:07,979
So...

1797
02:07:08,546 --> 02:07:09,814
that's really it.

1798
02:07:09,947 --> 02:07:11,682
You made the right choice.

1799
02:07:12,418 --> 02:07:14,018
This key...

1800
02:07:15,749 --> 02:07:17,985
is gonna change the world.

1801
02:07:34,038 --> 02:07:35,073
Aah!

1802
02:07:36,274 --> 02:07:37,742
Benji, I think I...

1803
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:39,811
I must've made a
wrong turn somewhere.

1804
02:07:39,944 --> 02:07:42,280
No. No, that's it. That's it.

1805
02:07:42,414 --> 02:07:44,582
What? How can this be it?

1806
02:07:44,715 --> 02:07:46,150
<i>You can see the train, right?</i>

1807
02:07:47,652 --> 02:07:50,154
Yes. I see the
train. What about it?

1808
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:53,257
And you have a parachute.
<i>Got a parachute?</i>

1809
02:07:54,426 --> 02:07:55,726
What do you expect me to do?

1810
02:07:55,727 --> 02:07:58,361
Well, just, you know... jump.

1811
02:07:58,362 --> 02:08:00,499
Just... jump?

1812
02:08:00,631 --> 02:08:01,933
<i>Yeah.</i> I mean,

1813
02:08:01,996 --> 02:08:03,331
Benji, it doesn't
work like that.

1814
02:08:03,332 --> 02:08:04,733
I'm not that high.

1815
02:08:04,734 --> 02:08:06,899
There's... there's ledges
sticking out everywhere.

1816
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:09,707
I'm gonna hit them before
the parachute even opens!

1817
02:08:09,708 --> 02:08:11,361
<i>Even if I could get
the parachute open,</i>

1818
02:08:11,367 --> 02:08:13,810
I don't know if I can
make it across the valley

1819
02:08:13,811 --> 02:08:17,114
and intercept and land
safely on a moving train!

1820
02:08:17,248 --> 02:08:20,451
<i>Do you copy?</i> Yes! I copy!

1821
02:08:20,452 --> 02:08:22,571
Look, I'm just trying
to help you, okay?

1822
02:08:22,572 --> 02:08:25,255
I need you to take a step back
and pull yourself together

1823
02:08:25,256 --> 02:08:28,126
because I am under a lot
of pressure right now!

1824
02:08:31,963 --> 02:08:34,899
Okay,
just think, just think.

1825
02:08:37,569 --> 02:08:39,137
What do I do?

1826
02:08:40,509 --> 02:08:42,773
I've got to get away
from this mountain.

1827
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:20,171
<i>Did you make it?</i>

1828
02:10:20,304 --> 02:10:21,339
Are you okay?

1829
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:24,242
I'm trying to get away
from this mountain!

1830
02:11:01,379 --> 02:11:02,447
Alana?

1831
02:11:03,314 --> 02:11:06,384
I just had the strangest feeling

1832
02:11:07,285 --> 02:11:09,554
the key wasn't the only
thing I'd be selling.

1833
02:11:11,148 --> 02:11:12,917
I don't understand.

1834
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:18,815
I'll sleep better just knowing
now it's in the right hands.

1835
02:11:19,864 --> 02:11:21,566
Goodbye, Mr. Kittridge.

1836
02:11:24,935 --> 02:11:26,672
It was a pleasure
to see you again.

1837
02:11:26,804 --> 02:11:27,872
And you.

1838
02:11:28,005 --> 02:11:30,308
Don't let him out of your sight.

1839
02:11:30,442 --> 02:11:32,744
Keep him safe until
we get to the station.

1840
02:11:32,830 --> 02:11:35,099
Alana? Don't worry
about me, Zola.

1841
02:11:48,407 --> 02:11:49,159
Alana?

1842
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:52,930
Who the hell else would it be?

1843
02:11:55,467 --> 02:11:56,967
The key.

1844
02:12:00,404 --> 02:12:02,741
Where is the key?

1845
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:05,142
She's got the key. Who?

1846
02:12:05,143 --> 02:12:07,379
The other one!

1847
02:12:25,863 --> 02:12:27,532
Move! Out
of the way, move!

1848
02:12:33,839 --> 02:12:35,239
No! Please!

1849
02:12:35,373 --> 02:12:37,375
Turn around! Please. Okay.

1850
02:12:38,075 --> 02:12:40,612
Okay. Everybody out! Now!

1851
02:12:40,746 --> 02:12:42,514
I see the train!

1852
02:12:42,647 --> 02:12:44,882
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1853
02:12:52,824 --> 02:12:54,258
The key.

1854
02:12:55,627 --> 02:12:57,161
The key!

1855
02:12:58,095 --> 02:13:00,097
Or the next one has
your name on it.

1856
02:13:01,999 --> 02:13:04,001
On the table.

1857
02:13:35,667 --> 02:13:36,934
Kill her.

1858
02:14:00,792 --> 02:14:02,026
Grace!

1859
02:14:06,465 --> 02:14:07,499
Ethan!

1860
02:14:15,172 --> 02:14:16,475
Are you okay?

1861
02:14:18,242 --> 02:14:19,678
Are you okay?

1862
02:14:35,392 --> 02:14:36,428
The key!

1863
02:14:37,328 --> 02:14:38,642
Tell me you have the key.

1864
02:14:39,096 --> 02:14:40,465
Where is the key?

1865
02:14:40,481 --> 02:14:41,582
It was just here.

1866
02:15:00,351 --> 02:15:01,987
We're on a runaway
train! I know.

1867
02:15:02,119 --> 02:15:03,187
I'm going after him.

1868
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:04,689
Okay. You...

1869
02:15:05,389 --> 02:15:06,525
You stop the train.

1870
02:15:06,658 --> 02:15:07,826
Okay. What?

1871
02:15:07,959 --> 02:15:10,862
No! No, wait!
How do I do that?

1872
02:15:10,996 --> 02:15:12,430
You'll figure it out!

1873
02:15:13,598 --> 02:15:14,633
What?

1874
02:15:15,467 --> 02:15:17,301
Excuse me. There was a man.

1875
02:15:17,364 --> 02:15:19,736
He just came through
here. There was a man.

1876
02:16:53,698 --> 02:16:55,232
Mr. Kittridge?

1877
02:17:00,270 --> 02:17:01,906
Sir, what are you doing here?

1878
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:03,908
I'm not here.

1879
02:17:04,042 --> 02:17:05,275
But you are.

1880
02:17:05,308 --> 02:17:06,911
And unless you want to
be sorting dead letters

1881
02:17:06,911 --> 02:17:08,145
at the postal service tomorrow,

1882
02:17:08,145 --> 02:17:10,415
you'll do exactly
what I tell you.

1883
02:19:08,633 --> 02:19:11,035
I know what the
key unlocks, Ethan.

1884
02:19:13,705 --> 02:19:15,907
I'm the only one who knows.

1885
02:19:42,399 --> 02:19:43,768
Hunt!

1886
02:19:45,069 --> 02:19:46,437
Hunt!

1887
02:19:47,111 --> 02:19:49,914
Hunt! Don't you do it!

1888
02:19:51,409 --> 02:19:53,077
Drop the knife!

1889
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:54,478
Put it down!

1890
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:56,481
I said drop it!

1891
02:19:57,215 --> 02:19:58,616
Do it!

1892
02:20:07,492 --> 02:20:09,393
On your feet!

1893
02:20:11,162 --> 02:20:12,263
Okay!

1894
02:20:12,264 --> 02:20:14,098
Drop that goddamn knife!

1895
02:20:14,099 --> 02:20:15,801
It's okay. It's okay.

1896
02:20:17,202 --> 02:20:18,670
Just take him.

1897
02:20:19,304 --> 02:20:21,338
Just cover him. Cover him!

1898
02:20:21,472 --> 02:20:22,506
He's the one you want.

1899
02:20:22,507 --> 02:20:24,275
Degas! I got it, I got it.

1900
02:20:24,276 --> 02:20:25,643
He's the one you want!

1901
02:20:25,777 --> 02:20:28,746
I don't care about
him, Hunt. I want you!

1902
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:30,682
No!

1903
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:50,535
It's okay.

1904
02:20:51,368 --> 02:20:52,503
It's okay.

1905
02:20:54,906 --> 02:20:56,007
Listen to me.

1906
02:20:56,274 --> 02:20:58,443
Everyone on this
train is gonna die

1907
02:20:58,576 --> 02:21:01,479
unless you do exactly as I say.

1908
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:25,637
<i>Mesdames, messieurs!
Excusez-moi. Sortez...</i>

1909
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:28,473
Everybody out!
Back of the train!

1910
02:21:37,882 --> 02:21:38,783
Grace.

1911
02:21:41,150 --> 02:21:42,585
I couldn't stop it.

1912
02:21:47,659 --> 02:21:48,893
No one can.

1913
02:21:49,307 --> 02:21:50,508
Come on.

1914
02:21:50,907 --> 02:21:53,330
Ethan, the key!
Grace, it's okay.

1915
02:21:53,331 --> 02:21:54,565
It's my fault.

1916
02:21:54,566 --> 02:21:56,168
If anything happens...

1917
02:21:56,434 --> 02:21:57,735
I got it.

1918
02:21:58,336 --> 02:21:59,837
We got it.

1919
02:22:20,765 --> 02:22:24,769
Ethan!

1920
02:22:26,097 --> 02:22:28,700
What do you mean,
you lost the key?

1921
02:22:28,701 --> 02:22:32,905
Move it! Move
it! Everybody move it!

1922
02:22:33,838 --> 02:22:36,040
All the way to the
back of the train!

1923
02:22:36,041 --> 02:22:37,134
All the way to the back!

1924
02:22:37,139 --> 02:22:39,108
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

1925
02:22:40,178 --> 02:22:42,280
Since you're not
really here, sir,

1926
02:22:42,414 --> 02:22:44,315
it shouldn't concern you.

1927
02:22:44,363 --> 02:22:46,631
All the way to the back!

1928
02:23:36,634 --> 02:23:38,302
Aah! Ethan!

1929
02:23:39,904 --> 02:23:41,272
Grace! Grace.

1930
02:23:41,492 --> 02:23:42,793
Grace!

1931
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:31,155
You're gonna have
to jump. What, jump?

1932
02:24:31,289 --> 02:24:32,723
Just jump! Go, go, go!

1933
02:25:20,138 --> 02:25:21,239
Oh, my God.

1934
02:25:36,854 --> 02:25:38,055
Aah! Whoa!

1935
02:25:38,056 --> 02:25:40,125
I'm on fire! Get
it off! Don't move!

1936
02:25:41,683 --> 02:25:43,752
It's out. It's out.

1937
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:01,941
Hang on!

1938
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:12,621
Run, run, run! Run, Grace!

1939
02:26:30,107 --> 02:26:31,610
Hang on.

1940
02:26:31,742 --> 02:26:33,010
Aah!

1941
02:26:34,779 --> 02:26:36,448
I got you.

1942
02:26:36,449 --> 02:26:37,749
I got you.

1943
02:26:38,923 --> 02:26:40,184
Okay. Don't look down.

1944
02:26:40,185 --> 02:26:42,420
I said don't look
down. Just look at me.

1945
02:26:42,421 --> 02:26:45,156
Now, I'm gonna jump across,
and you're gonna wait here.

1946
02:26:52,631 --> 02:26:54,532
Grace, you have to let go.

1947
02:26:54,533 --> 02:26:56,100
Grace, you got to let me go.

1948
02:26:56,148 --> 02:26:58,569
You got to let me jump
across, or we're gonna die.

1949
02:26:58,570 --> 02:26:59,937
Do you trust me?

1950
02:26:59,938 --> 02:27:02,040
You gonna trust me or not?
You've got to trust me.

1951
02:27:03,341 --> 02:27:04,742
Grace.

1952
02:27:06,544 --> 02:27:07,579
Okay.

1953
02:27:08,525 --> 02:27:10,114
Come on, Grace.
Give me your hand.

1954
02:27:10,115 --> 02:27:12,281
You got to jump. Don't
look up! Look at me.

1955
02:27:12,282 --> 02:27:13,984
Trust me, I won't let you fall.

1956
02:27:13,985 --> 02:27:15,383
I promise. We're almost there.

1957
02:27:15,384 --> 02:27:17,787
Come on. I won't let you fall!

1958
02:27:17,788 --> 02:27:19,055
Jump, Grace, jump!

1959
02:27:19,056 --> 02:27:20,323
You got to trust me!

1960
02:27:20,324 --> 02:27:21,493
Jump, please!

1961
02:27:31,282 --> 02:27:32,316
Don't look down.

1962
02:27:46,083 --> 02:27:47,203
Listen to me very carefully.

1963
02:27:47,318 --> 02:27:49,053
We're gonna pull
you up together.

1964
02:27:50,321 --> 02:27:51,456
Aah!

1965
02:27:51,590 --> 02:27:53,224
Grace! Aah!

1966
02:27:55,793 --> 02:27:57,061
Aah!

1967
02:27:57,194 --> 02:27:59,431
It's okay. It's
okay. It's okay.

1968
02:28:20,752 --> 02:28:23,054
Go over me. Go, go.

1969
02:28:50,948 --> 02:28:52,147
Thank you, Luther.

1970
02:28:52,148 --> 02:28:53,249
What is that?

1971
02:28:53,250 --> 02:28:54,509
It's a speed wing.

1972
02:28:55,286 --> 02:28:57,021
It's our ticket off this train.

1973
02:28:58,423 --> 02:28:59,458
Oh.

1974
02:29:17,676 --> 02:29:19,977
Ethan. Ethan!

1975
02:29:27,593 --> 02:29:29,123
<i>It's true.</i>

1976
02:29:30,267 --> 02:29:31,599
<i>He told me...</i>

1977
02:29:32,461 --> 02:29:34,079
<i>...I would betray him.</i>

1978
02:29:36,911 --> 02:29:38,313
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1979
02:29:43,567 --> 02:29:44,903
<i>Why...</i>

1980
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:48,599
<i>did you spare my life?</i>

1981
02:29:58,646 --> 02:29:59,581
No, no, no.

1982
02:29:59,657 --> 02:30:01,759
<i>No,no ....stay with me.</i>

1983
02:30:04,959 --> 02:30:06,517
<i>You know what this is?</i>

1984
02:30:07,668 --> 02:30:09,259
<i>You know what this is?</i>

1985
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:11,162
<i>Oui?</i>

1986
02:30:11,832 --> 02:30:13,666
<i>What does it unlock?</i>

1987
02:30:16,915 --> 02:30:18,595
<i>What does it unlock?</i>

1988
02:30:20,204 --> 02:30:23,575
<i>Sevas... topol.</i>

1989
02:30:24,754 --> 02:30:25,987
Sevastopol?

1990
02:30:26,177 --> 02:30:29,947
The city Sevastopol
in the Crimea.

1991
02:30:30,816 --> 02:30:31,909
Where?

1992
02:30:32,576 --> 02:30:34,165
<i>Where is sevastopol?</i>

1993
02:30:37,388 --> 02:30:40,425
<i>Sous... marin.</i>

1994
02:30:41,970 --> 02:30:43,495
<i>Sous-marin?</i>

1995
02:30:47,097 --> 02:30:48,567
The submarine.

1996
02:30:51,235 --> 02:30:52,970
The Sevastopol.</

1997
02:30:57,423 --> 02:30:59,423
<i>Good luck.</i>

1998
02:31:04,015 --> 02:31:05,784
They'll be coming, Ethan.

1999
02:31:09,821 --> 02:31:11,155
<i>Merci.</i>

2000
02:31:28,083 --> 02:31:29,553
What is it?

2001
02:31:30,937 --> 02:31:32,170
What?

2002
02:31:33,310 --> 02:31:35,312
It can only carry one.

2003
02:31:36,378 --> 02:31:37,413
Oh.

2004
02:31:38,115 --> 02:31:39,483
I understand.

2005
02:31:40,685 --> 02:31:42,687
Grace. Ethan, it's okay.

2006
02:31:44,699 --> 02:31:45,900
This was the plan.

2007
02:31:46,627 --> 02:31:48,729
You have the key.
You have to go.

2008
02:31:50,729 --> 02:31:51,630
Grace.

2009
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:55,900
Hunt?

2010
02:31:56,801 --> 02:31:57,969
Go. Hunt!

2011
02:31:58,103 --> 02:31:59,503
Go! Hunt!

2012
02:32:00,005 --> 02:32:01,505
No, no! Hunt!

2013
02:32:03,405 --> 02:32:05,240
Out of the way! Out of the way!

2014
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:22,527
No. No, hey.

2015
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:24,494
Got a pulse. Got a pulse.

2016
02:32:24,495 --> 02:32:26,463
Come on, stay with me.

2017
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:44,816
This is better, isn't it?

2018
02:32:46,151 --> 02:32:48,419
Face to authentic face?

2019
02:32:48,631 --> 02:32:50,021
Mr. Kittridge,

2020
02:32:50,818 --> 02:32:54,220
Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

2021
02:32:55,003 --> 02:32:56,571
Does he now?

2022
02:32:56,665 --> 02:32:57,799
He also said

2023
02:32:58,257 --> 02:33:00,259
you would offer me a choice.

2024
02:33:01,871 --> 02:33:03,172
Interesting.

2025
02:33:04,287 --> 02:33:06,323
I choose to accept.

2026
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:15,479
<i>We cannot
escape the past.</i>

2027
02:33:16,037 --> 02:33:18,516
<i>Some of us are
doomed to repeat it.</i>

2028
02:33:19,412 --> 02:33:22,783
<i>Grace may believe you've
saved her from her fate,</i>

2029
02:33:22,987 --> 02:33:26,490
<i>but you and I both know
you've merely bought her time.</i>

2030
02:33:27,525 --> 02:33:30,394
<i>But that's the
pattern, isn't it?</i>

2031
02:33:30,411 --> 02:33:32,780
<i>The cross you've
been left to bear.</i>

2032
02:33:33,765 --> 02:33:36,167
<i>The closer someone gets to you,</i>

2033
02:33:37,001 --> 02:33:39,403
<i>the harder it is
to keep them alive.</i>

2034
02:33:41,773 --> 02:33:42,974
Thank God.

2035
02:33:58,690 --> 02:34:01,425
<i>A new day brings a new burden.</i>

2036
02:34:03,039 --> 02:34:06,275
<i>The key is only the beginning.</i>

2037
02:34:08,201 --> 02:34:09,802
<i>Wherever it leads...</i>

2038
02:34:10,597 --> 02:34:12,533
<i>whatever it takes
to get there...</i>

2039
02:34:14,038 --> 02:34:16,674
<i>you'll have to do
it on your own.</i>

2040
02:34:19,213 --> 02:34:20,982
<i>Should you fail in your mission,</i>

2041
02:34:21,179 --> 02:34:22,881
<i>the Entity wins,</i>

2042
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:25,442
<i>Gabriel wins,</i>

2043
02:34:25,443 --> 02:34:28,045
<i>and the world will pay
the ultimate price.</i>

2044
02:34:29,254 --> 02:34:32,991
<i>Should any members of your
team be caught or killed,</i>

2045
02:34:33,124 --> 02:34:35,894
<i>their sacrifice will
have been in vain.</i>

2046
02:34:36,967 --> 02:34:38,334
<i>So hurry.</i>

2047
02:34:39,052 --> 02:34:40,721
<i>There isn't much time.</i>

2048
02:34:41,706 --> 02:34:46,711
<i>The world doesn't know it,
but they're counting on you.</i>

2049
02:35:07,222 --> 02:35:08,725
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>
