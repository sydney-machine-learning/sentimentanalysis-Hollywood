91
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,837

cold for camping.

00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,665

120
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,831
Oh, you'd love

121
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,067
- No.
- Oh, I'm holding out for someone

122
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,636
far superior to
that idle peasant.

123
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,572
Chin-chin.

124
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,676
That is extremely strong stuff.

125
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,144
Yeah, you can run cars on that.

126
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,814
So, what is it I can do
for you? Room, is it?

127
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,016
Well, yes, but, uh...

128
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,120
Mr. Wonka is
temporarily embarrassed.

129
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,422
Oh, no. You don't say.

130
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,867
I'm afraid that's
true, Mrs. Scrubitt.

131
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,192
But...

132
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,194
- all that's about to change.
- Oh, yeah?

133
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,162
You see, I'm something
of a magician,

134
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,098
inventor and chocolate maker.

135
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,634
And first thing tomorrow
at the Galeries Gourmet,

136
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,570
I plan to unveil my most
astonishing creation yet.

137
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,972
- Oh?
- Prepare to be amazed

138
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,595
as I present to you...

139
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,577
A teapot?

140
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,978
No, that's just for making tea.

141
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,788
One second.

142
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,118
That's for my stew.

143
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,001
It's in here somewhere.

144
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,765
Don't you worry, Mr. Wonka. I can
see you're a man of great ingenuity.

145
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,591
And we've got just
the thing for ya.

146
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,459
The entrepreneurial package.

147
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,870
Now, the room is one
sovereign a night,

148
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,796
but you don't have to
pay till 6:00 tomorrow.

149
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,741
Does that give you enough
time to earn a few pennies?

150
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,767
More than enough,
Mrs. Scrubitt.

151
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,908
Thank you.

152
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,871
Oh, it's the least I can
do for a stranger in need.

153
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,807
Now, sign here and
we're all done.

154
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,076

156
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,236
What?

157
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:11,551
- Thank you,
Noodle. That'll do.

158
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,053
Ooh. What'd she say?

159
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,688
- Who's that, then?
- The girl.

160
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,697
-What girl?
-That girl. It sounded like,

161
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,660
"Read the small print." And
there does seem to be a lot of...

162
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,486
Oh. Oh. Oh.

163
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,066
Oh. Oh.

164
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,668
Oh. Just keeps on coming.

165
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,704
Yeah, you don't wanna
listen to Noodle, Mr. Wonka.

166
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,605
- She's damaged.
- Damaged?

167
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,210
Orphan Syndrome.

168
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,336
Orphan Syndrome?

169
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,543
Orphan Syndrome.

170
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,353
Orphan Syndrome.

171
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,890
She was dropped down the laundry
chute as a bab, and I took her in

172
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,582
out the goodness of my heart,

173
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,684
and I've done my best,
Mr. Wonka, honest, I have,

174
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,820
but she's been left with
a suspicious nature.

175
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,222
She sees conspiracy everywhere.

176
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,558
- Poor girl.
- I know.

177
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,827
These are just your
standard Ts and Cs,

178
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,163
but you're welcome to
take a look if you want.

179
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,865
I'll just give it a once-over.

180
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,542
Well, that all seems
to be in order.

181
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,944
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

182
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,746
- Hello.
- Ah!

183
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,103
Then welcome to Scrubitt's.

184
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,986
There you are, Mr. Wonka.
The entrepreneurial suite.

185
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,889
There's your four-poster,
and your sink plus soap,

186
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:23,966
and there's a little
mint on your pillow.

187
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,592
Fantastic.

188
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,960
What kind people.

189
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,836
Noodle!

190
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,839
Oh, Noodle!

191
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,502
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt?

192
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:42,709
I've been lookin' for you.

193
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,822
What do you want?

194
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,658
I wanna teach you a lesson,
you miserable little bookworm.

195
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:46,818
What did I do wrong?

196
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,189
You know what you did, you brat.

197
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,749
- Stop squirming!
- What? No, please.

198
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,586
You ever interfere
in my business again,

199
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,022
and you'll be in this coop
all week. Do you understand?

200
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,059
Yes, Mrs. Scrubitt.
Sorry, Mrs. Scrubitt.

201
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,791
I should think so, too.

202
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,192
Here we go, Mamma.

203
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,594
Ladies and gentlemen of
the Galeries Gourmet,

204
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,838
my name is Willy Wonka,

205
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,273
and I have come to show
you a marvelous morsel,

206
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,275
an incredible edible,

207
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:52,112
an unbeatable eatable,

208
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,913
the likes of which this
world has never seen.

209
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,749
So quiet up and listen down.

210
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,685
No, scratch that, reverse it.

211
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,386
I give to you

212
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,754
the Hoverchoc.

Bravo!

239
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,402
Thank you.

240
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,803
- Miss Bon-Bon?
- Yes, Mr. Slugworth.

241
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,071
Call the police.

242
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,806
Very good, sir.

243
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,175
Well, who wants to try one?

244
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,077
- Me, please!
- I will.

245
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,814
- Mr. Slugworth, sir.
- 'Scuse me.

246
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,049
Mr. Fickelgruber.

247
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,084
And Mr. Prodnose.

248
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,319
What an honor.

249
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,987
Ever since I was a little boy...

250
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,956
That is quite a handshake.

251
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,191
It's a business
handshake, Mr. Wonka.

252
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,961
Lets people know
I mean business.

253
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,395
- Huh...
- Now, come along.

254
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,233
Let's try one of these
so-called Hoverchocs.

255
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,911
Ooh.

256
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,447
It's not just chocolate, is it?

257
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,815
There's...

258
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,350
- marshmallow.
- That's right.

259
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,486
Harvested from the
mallow marshes of Peru.

260
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,954
And caramel.

261
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,090
- But... but it's...
- Salted.

262
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,993
With the bittersweet
tears of a Russian clown.

263
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,894
And is that...

264
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:22,929
Surely not?

265
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,098
Cherry?

266
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,509
Cherry-picked by the pick
of the cherry pickers

267
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,435
from the Imperial
Gardens in Japan.

268
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:32,071
Well, Mr. Wonka.

269
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,840
I've been in this
business a very long time,

270
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,409
and I can safely say

271
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,111
that of all the chocolate
I have ever tasted,

272
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,146
this is without doubt

273
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,417
the absolute 100% worst.

274
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,917
Whoo!

275
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,028
There we have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

276
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,054
An endorsement from Mr...

277
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,289
Wait. The worst?

278
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,125
We three are the
fiercest of rivals,

279
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,893
and yet we agree on one thing.

280
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,962
A good chocolate
should be simple.

281
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,064
Plain. Uncomplicated.

282
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,167
Whereas this, with all
its bells and whistles...

283
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,169
Well, it's just...

284
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,304
Weird.

285
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,206
That's a shame.

286
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,243
- If you thought the
chocolate was weird,

287
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,878
you're gonna hate
what happens next.

288
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,847
Hmm?

289
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,916
What's happening?
Whoa, what's going on?

290
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,452
That's the hoverfly.

291
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,119
It's broken out of its cocoon.

292
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,121
It's flapping its
wings like billy-oh.

293
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,025
My hair! You mean a
fly is doing this?

294
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,494
Yes. But don't worry.

295
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,430
- It'll be completely unharmed.
- Oh, thank you.

296
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,197
In about 20 minutes,
it'll get tired

297
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,865
and exit through your rear.

298
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,468
You what?

299
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,045
He means we're going to fart
them out of our botties!

300
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,870
Yes, I know what he meant.

301
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,172
You're off your rocker, Wonka!

302
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,441
Who in their right mind

303
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,175
wants a chocolate
that makes you fly?

304
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,448
Well, let's find out, shall we?

305
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,345
Who's for a Hoverchoc?

306
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,548
I want one!

307
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,982
One sovereign,
please. Thank you.

308
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,918
Thank you very much.

309
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,986
One sovereign.
Thank you, madam.

310
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Enjoy your flight.

311
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,990
Look, I'm flying! I'm flying!

312
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:02,862
How's the view up there?

313
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,332
Not too high, darling!

314
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,604
Beat it, kid.

315
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,206
All right, folks.
Nothin' to see here.

316
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,943
Just a small group of people
defyin' the laws of gravity.

317
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,512
- Yeah.
- Hook 'em, boys.

318
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,547
That's the Hoverchoc,
sir. That's the point.

319
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,683
I'm afraid we've had some
complaints about you, sir.

320
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,451
Complaints?

321
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,195
That you're disrupting the
trade of other businesses.

322
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,354
I'm regrettably
obliged to move you on

323
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,089
and to confiscate

324
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,658
your earnings.

325
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,393
- Hey! What are you doing?
- No!

326
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,937
Don't worry, it's
going to a good cause.

327
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,497
- Get off.
- Sick kids, or something.

328
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,465
Sorry, sir. Rules is rules.

329
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,099
Cheeky devil, you! Come here!

330
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,669
Could you at least
leave me a sovereign?

331
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,237
I need to pay for my room.

332
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:49,643
Here.

333
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,044
Thank you.

334
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,183
Evening, Mr. Wonka.

335
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,453
How'd it go?

336
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,287
Not quite as well as I'd hoped.

337
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,357
Oh, shame. Well, I'm afraid
we do have to settle up now.

338
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,192
Well, thankfully, the
room's taken care of.

339
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,629
Believe we said a sovereign.

340
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,096
For the room, yes.

341
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,166
But you have
incurred a few extras

342
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,235
during the course of your
residency with ourselves.

343
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,673
- Have I?
- Yes, you have.

344
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,476
There was that glass of
gin you had on arrival,

345
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,076
and if I remember rightly,

346
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,447
you warmed your
cockles by the fire.

347
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,281
He did indeed, Mrs. Scrubitt.

348
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,584
Cockle-warming is extra, see?

349
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,286
Used the stairs to get
to his room, and all.

350
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,021
Oh, then you've got
your stair charge,

351
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,624
and that is per step,
I'm afraid. Up and down.

352
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,325
Now, tell me, Mr. Wonka,

353
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,595
did you happen to
use the mini bar?

354
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,729
There's a minibar?

355
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:44,063
Mini bar of soap.

356
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,398
By the sink.

357
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,601
- Uh... I might have, briefly.
- Oh-ho!

358
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,770
See? Even Bleacher knows you
never touch the mini bar,

359
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,738
and he was raised in a ditch.

360
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,607
Add in your mattress hire,

361
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,742
your linen lease, and
your pillow penalty,

362
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,444
and you are looking at...

363
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:59,278
Ten thousand sovereigns.

364
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,581
You gotta be kidding me?

365
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,115
It's all in the
small print, dearie.

366
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,518
I don't have 10,000 sovereigns.

367
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,588
Then we have a
problem, Mr. Wonka.

368
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,288
You're gonna have to work it off

369
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,657
in the Wash House, ain't ya?

370
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,158
At a sovereign a day.

371
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,460
Ten thousand days is...

372
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:14,595
Twenty-seven years.

373
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:15,629
- Hey!
- Four months.

374
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,531
And 16 days.

375
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,338
Ah.

376
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,040
- You must be Mr. Wonka.
- Who are you?

377
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,244
Abacus Crunch,
chartered accountant.

378
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,746
At least, I was.

379
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,047
- Now, uh...
- He runs the place.

380
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,350
And you best do as he says,
or you'll answer to me.

381
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,352
Piper Benz. Plumber by trade.

382
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,455
This is Miss Lottie Bell.

383
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,055
Hi.

384
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,458
She don't talk much.

385
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:48,261
And I'm Larry Chucklesworth!

386
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,262
Comedian.

387
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,531
Hmm.

388
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,164
So they got all of
you, too, did they?

389
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,433
I'm afraid so.

390
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,735
We each of us found ourselves

391
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,335
in need of a cheap
place to stay,

392
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,171
and neglected to
read the small print.

393
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:03,175
One moment of stupidity,
followed by endless regret.

394
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,746
Sounds like my third marriage.

395
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,448
I'm sorry, I do that a lot.

396
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,082
- He does.
- A lot.

397
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,518
I've only been married once,

398
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,252
and it didn't work out.

399
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,597
There's gotta be
some way outta here.

400
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,456
You don't think we've tried?

401
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,468
There are bars on the window
and there's a dog on the door.

402
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,760
And even if you could get out,

403
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,261
that contract is watertight.

404
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,507
If you're not here at roll call,
Mrs. Scrubitt will call the police,

405
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,433
they'll bring you right back,

406
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,586
and she'll charge you a
thousand for the inconvenience.

407
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,513
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

408
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,705
Come along, Mr. Wonka.

409
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,541
You come with me.

410
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,276
You're in here. On suds.

411
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,785

See clause five.

433
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,623
- Section 7A.
- Paragraph 22.

434
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,924
Part D.

435
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,660
Which says...

436
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:00,861

00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:04,864

440

Room service.

441
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,270
Told you to read
the small print.

442
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,773
Slight problem with that.

443
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,944
You can't read, can you?

444
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,914
I focused my studies almost
exclusively on chocolate.

445
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:56,483
I see.

446
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,318
For everything else, I've relied
on the kindness of strangers.

447
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,955
And look where that's got
you. The staff quarters.

448
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:03,923
You've got a bed.

449
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,029
You had a bed.

450
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:13,332
Desk, and a wash basin/toilet.

451
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,768
- Ugh.
- The water comes

452
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,437
in two temperatures. Cold...

453
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,638
and colder.

454
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,875
How much do you owe them?

455
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,543
Ten thousand.

456
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:25,946
Count yourself
lucky. I owe 30.

457
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,048
What? How do you
owe them money?

458
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,282
I thought they found you
down a laundry chute.

459
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,752
Oh, they did.

460
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,429
Took me in out of the
goodness of their hearts

461
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,689
and charged me
for the privilege.

462
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,457
What a pair of monsters.

463
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:40,627
The greedy beat the needy
every time, Mr. Wonka.

464
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,394
Guess it's just the
way of the world.

465
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,797
Oh, come on, Noodle.

466
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,866
That's just your Orphan
Syndrome talking.

467
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,436
- My what?
- Your Orphan Syndrome.

468
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,639
And we are not gonna
be eating any slops.

469
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,508
What are you doing?

470
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,909
I'm making chocolate, o' course.

471
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,343
How do you like it? Dark?

472
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,846
White? Nutty?
Absolutely insane?

473
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,347
I don't know.

474
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,417
I've never had any.

475
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,920
You've never had chocolate?

476
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,588
- No.
- What?

477
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,890
You've never had chocolate?

478
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,659
Still no.

479
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,361
Well, this is unbelievable.
I mean, this is outrageous.

480
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,363
Well, lucky for you,
Noodle, I have a selection

481
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,799
of the world's
finest ingredients

482
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,600
right here in my travel factory.

483
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,040
Whoa.

484
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,909
Where to begin?
That's the question.

485
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,477
I know!

486
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,678
Silver Linings.

487
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,747
Made of condensed thunder clouds

488
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,349
and liquid sunlight.

489
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,419
Helps you see that
faint ray o' hope

490
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,353
beyond the shadow of despair.

491
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,656
Just what we need,

492
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,024
wouldn't you say?

493
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,725
Did you always wanna
make chocolate?

494
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,694
No.

495
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,129
Back when I was your age,

496
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,064
I wanted to be a magician.

497
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,767
My mom was a cook.

498
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,368
We lived on the river,
just the two of us.

499
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:59,338
In a perfect little
world of our own.

500
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,743
<i>The way I remember
it, I used to spend</i>

501
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,445
<i>every waking hour
trying to come up</i>

502
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,647
<i>with some new trick
to impress my mom.</i>

503
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:11,051
Bravo!

504
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,587
<i>But the real magic
came from her.</i>

505
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,491
<i>We didn't have a lotta
money, but each week,</i>

506
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,627
<i>she brought home one cocoa bean.</i>

507
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,495
<i>And by the time my
birthday came around,</i>

508
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,731
<i>there was enough to make
a single bar o' chocolate.</i>

509
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,802
<i>But it wasn't just
any old chocolate.</i>

510
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,538
<i>Far from it.</i>

511
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,074
This has to be the best
chocolate in the world.

512
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,775
Oh, don't know about that.

513
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,078
They say the very best
comes from a place

514
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,180
called the Galeries Gourmet.

515
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,949
Theirs can't be any
better than yours, Mamma.

516
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,584
It's impossible.

517
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:47,854
Well, as it so happens,

518
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,656
I do know a little secret

519
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,958
that even those
fancy-pants don't.

520
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,027
What is it?

521
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,729
I'll tell ya.

522
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,531
When you're older.
Now get to sleep.

523
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,606
We should go, Amma.

524
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,108
Where's that, then?

525
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:10,210
- To the Galeries Gourmet.
- What?

526
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,212
- And start a shop?
- Yeah.

527
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,915
With our name above the
door and everything.

528
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:16,950
That's a wonderful dream, honey.

529
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,653
Is that all it is?

530
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,489
Just a dream?

531
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,025
Hey now.

532
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:32,232
Every good thing in this
world started with a dream.

533
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,701
So you hold on to yours.

534
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,937
And when you do share
chocolate with the world,

535
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,540
oh, I'll be right
there beside ya.

536
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:41,541
Promise?

537
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:42,776
Do better than that.

538
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,078
I pinkie promise.

539
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,581
Now,

540
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,616
sleep.

541
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,955
<i>So, what was it, Willy?</i>

542
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,958
<i>What was the secret?</i>

543
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,592
<i>I never found out.</i>

544
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:04,164
<i>Soon after, she fell sick.</i>

545
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:07,534
<i>And before I knew it, all I had
left was her bar of chocolate.</i>

546
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,274
That's why I'm here, Noodle.

547
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:17,544
So I can feel the same
way I did back then,

548
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,179
eating chocolate with her.

549
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,916
What do you mean?

550
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,127
My mom once promised that when I
share chocolate with the world,

551
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:27,020
she'd be right there beside me.

552
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:31,024
I know it sounds crazy,
but I always hoped

553
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,337
she'd somehow keep that promise.

554
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,529
She might even
tell me her secret.

555
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,237
Here. Try one.

556
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,091
Wish you hadn't done that.

557
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,761
- You don't like it?
- No,

558
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,163
I like it. It's just...

559
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,033
What?

560
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:17,604
Now each day I don't have
chocolate will be a little harder.

561
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,207
Then how would you like to have all
the chocolate you can eat, every day,

562
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,742
for the rest of your life?

563
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:23,910
A lifetime supply?

564
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,179
A lifetime supply.

565
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,313
What would I have to do?

566
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:29,182
Not much. Just get
me out of here.

567
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,184
- Are you crazy?
- Shh!

568
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,186
It's easy. I'll get
someone to cover my shift,

569
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,830
and you could smuggle me
out in your laundry cart.

570
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,098
- But I...
- Just for a few hours, mind.

571
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,791
No one will even
know I was gone.

572
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,626
What's the point of that?

573
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,303
To sell chocolate, o' course!
We'll split the profits

574
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,671
and pay off Mrs.
Scrubitt in no time.

575
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,097
It's a nice idea, Willy.

576
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,099
- It's a great idea.
- But it'll never work.

577
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,834
'Course it will.
Eat your chocolate.

578
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,969
You don't understand.

579
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,605
Mrs. Scrubitt's like a hawk. She
keeps her beady eye on everything

580
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,874
that comes in and out of
the Wash House except...

581
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:56,910
Huh.

582
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,678
What is it?

583
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,780
No, it's nothing.

584
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:01,915
Oh, okay.

585
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,817
Huh.

586
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,285
Double-huh! That's
not nothing.

587
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,029
That's the Silver Lining.
It's given you an idea.

588
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,656
Okay. So, the one time
she dropped her guard

589
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,624
was when this aristocrat
came to the laundry.

590
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,393
He was only asking
for directions,

591
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:15,628
but she was all over
him like a rash.

592
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:16,996
It was disgusting.

593
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,331
That's it, Noodle.

594
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,899
All we have to do is
find an aristocrat

595
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,768
and slip out while
she's distracted.

596
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,404
Yeah, but...

597
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,672
where are we going to
find an aristocrat?

598
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,776
Huh.

599
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,810
Huh?

600
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,879
Huh.

601
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,114
A double-huh.

602
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,324
Do you have a pencil and paper?

603
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,851
- Uh-huh.
- I got an idea.

604
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,440
I've come to make a confession.

605
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,144
You sound great,
fellas. Keep it up.

606
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,418
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

607
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,923
I have had 150 of these
since my last confession.

608
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,228
Temptation is very
hard to resist.

609
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,434
Mmm.

610
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,935
Send me down.

611
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,672
I'll see you later.

612
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,679
Good evening, Chief.

613
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,482
They're all waiting.

614
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:42,916
Thank you very much.

615
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:47,787
Good evening, gentlemen.
I've brought my invoice.

616
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,492
One chocolatier moved
on for the usual fee.

617
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:53,059
Oh.

618
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,394
Here we go, baby.

619
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:56,095
There's the good stuff. Yeah.

620
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,064
- Tell me, Chief...
- Mm-hmm?

621
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,042
How would you like to
earn a few more of those?

622
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,435
Oh, I am listening.

623
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,236
We think that Mr. Wonka

624
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,207
might require a little
more than simply moving on.

625
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,808
- Oh.
- He's good.

626
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:09,976
Too good.

627
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,277
And what's more,

628
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,813
he only charges a
sovereign a chocolate.

629
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,249
So anyone can afford
them, even the...

630
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,953
You know, the...

631
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:22,489
- The poor?
- Oh, dear.

632
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:25,325
I've just been a little
bit sick in my mouth.

633
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,026
Could you please
refrain from mentioning

634
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,828
that demographic in my presence?

635
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,407
He doesn't like it
when people say "poor."

636
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:32,265
Sorry, Felix.

637
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:35,168
We want you to send
Wonka a message.

638
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,404
Backed up by physical force.

639
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:40,073
That if he attempts to sell
chocolate in this town again,

640
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:43,410
he is liable to meet
with a little accident.

641
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:46,212
In which he dies.

642
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,847
Yeah, no, I... I
got that already.

643
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,349
You don't have to
keep saying it.

644
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:51,060
I'm just making sure we're
all on the same page.

645
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,952
Well, no one's on your page.

646
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:54,096
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I know what it means...

647
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,197
Actually, what does it mean?

648
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,423
Gentlemen, please.

649
00:30:58,124 --> 00:30:59,892
So, what do you say, Chief?

650
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,394
Do we have a deal?

651
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:04,330
Well, listen, fellas, I'm
an officer of the law.

652
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,434
I can't just go around
roughin' up your competition.

653
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,769
I'm sorry.

654
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,238
Well now, Chief.

655
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,443
I can see that you're
a man of integrity.

656
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,580
Thank you.

657
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,482

00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:29,142
- Here.
- Wonka.

707
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,444
Bleacher!

708
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:32,945
Toilet's blocked again.

709
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,080
Oh, wow.

710
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,015
The unmistakable sound of love.

711
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,485
You what?

712
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,052
Don't tell me you
hadn't noticed.

713
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,220
What?

714
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:42,723
She's madly in love with you.

715
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,591
Mrs. Scrubitt?

716
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,025
Besotted.

717
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,227
And why not? Look at you.

718
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:49,730
Fine figure of a man.

719
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,632
You just need to tidy
yourself up a little bit.

720
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:53,366
Get some new clothes.

721
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,034
Have a bath.

722
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,302
A bath?

723
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,271
You do know what
they say, right?

724
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,040
What do they say?

725
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,709
She'll be thankful for an ankle.

726
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:05,144
- Yes.
- And pleased to see your knees.

727
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:06,218
- Right.
- But if you wanna

728
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,214
- make her sigh...
- Tell me.

729
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,349
Show her some thigh.

730
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,186
Bleacher!

731
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,688
It's overflowing now.

732
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,490
- Get in there. Back to work.
- All right.

733
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:17,758
It's up to me ankles!

734
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,626
Time-waster.

735
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,127
Bleacher!

736
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,329
Curse that idle peasant.

737
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,173
What you got there?

738
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,341
Nothing.

739
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,779
Do you like that coop, Noodle?

740
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,747
All right.

741
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:43,025
I was collecting laundry from
Professor Monocle the other day.

742
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,518
Yeah.

743
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:46,228
He's writing a book about
the Bavarian Royal Family.

744
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,721
Boring.

745
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,432
He's got sketches of
noblemen all over his wall.

746
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:50,591
So?

747
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:52,391
This one looked rather familiar.

748
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,529
Oh.

749
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,598
Blow me. That looks
exactly like...

Mr. Bleacher.

751
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:03,604

is a Bavarian aristocrat?

752
00:35:03,637 --> 00:35:05,271
Uh-huh.

- Where?
- Where you're from.

802
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,690
Oh, yes. It's very...

803
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,859
- Bavarian.
- Oh, whoo.

804
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,833
All clear.

805
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,534
- Really?
- Yeah.

806
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,603
We did it! Well done, Noodle.

807
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,405
I can't believe it worked.

812
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,346
Not again.

813
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,849
Where are the chocolates?

814
00:37:28,882 --> 00:37:31,384
I don't know how to tell
you this, Noodle, but...

815
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,686
they've been stolen.

816
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,220
- Stolen?
- Mm-hmm.

817
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,589
Who by?

818
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:37,924
The Little Orange Man.

819
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,660
What?

820
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:41,404
The Little Orange Man. I
didn't tell you about him?

821
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,295
No, ya didn't.

822
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,465
He's my nemesis.
About yea high.

823
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:46,643
Comes in the dead of the night,

824
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,769
and he steals all my chocolate.

825
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:51,370
Been happening every few weeks for
the past three, four years now.

826
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:52,439
Really?

827
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,874
Sometimes I spy him

828
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,208
in that strange realm
'twixt sleep and wake,

829
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,654
green hair glinting
in the moonlight.

830
00:37:57,678 --> 00:37:58,979
Green hair?

831
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:00,514
One day I shall
catch him, Noodle.

832
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:01,581
- Willy.
- When I do...

833
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,315
- Willy!
- Hmm?

834
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,485
You don't seriously expect
me to believe this, do you?

835
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,654
Of course I do. What other
explanation is there?

836
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:08,755
I don't know,

837
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,457
- that you go to sleep...
- Mm-hmm.

838
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,668
Dream 'bout Little Green Man...

839
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:12,802
Orange man, green hair. Yeah.

840
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:14,226
And while you're dreaming,

841
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,829
stuff your face with chocolate!

842
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:17,229
Stuff my...

843
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:19,433
That makes a lot more sense.

844
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,834
Why'd I ever think
this would work?

845
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,602
I've been eating all
my own chocolate?

846
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:23,235
- Stupid Silver Linings.
- I don't think I have been.

847
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:24,638
Hey!

848
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:25,948
There's nothing stupid
about my chocolate.

849
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,374
If Mrs. Scrubitt
had spotted us,

850
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:29,910
I'd be in the coop right now.

851
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,445
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

852
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,345
But we can make more chocolate.

853
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:35,582
Only problem is I'm
all out of milk.

854
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:37,451
Well, that's not a problem.

855
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:40,319
Milk.

856
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,388
A, that is stealing.

857
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,757
And C,

858
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,826
Willy Wonka does not
use any old cow's milk.

859
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,259
For this particular creation,

860
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,563
I require the milk of a giraffe.

861
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,397
Okay... fine.

862
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,975
As a matter of fact,
there's one at the zoo.

863
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,434
Bingala!

864
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:56,570
But A, the zoo is not that way.

865
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:57,637
Great.

866
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,473
And B,

867
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,274
they're not gonna let you just
walk in there and milk it.

868
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:05,846
Mm. That, my dear Noodle,
is why we're very lucky

869
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:08,515
the Little Orange
Man didn't find this.

870
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:14,386
What is it?

871
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:15,689
From Zoo Management.

872
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:19,025
In recognition of
your years of service.

873
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,627
But I've only been here a year.

874
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:25,297
Which is why there's
only one chocolate.

875
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:27,534
Huh.

876
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:28,969
Well, thank you very much.

877
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,771
You're welcome. Good night!

878
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:33,740
Hey, well done, Noodle.

879
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:35,809
So, what is it really?

880
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:37,611
It's called A Big Night Out.

881
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:39,021
A single chocolate
that perfectly mimics

882
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:40,814
- a night on the town.
- Mmm.

883
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:43,382
The outer layer, a
champagne truffle.

884
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,551
That's lovely.

885
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,052
The next is white wine.

886
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:47,087
Mmm.

887
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,421
Followed by red.

888
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:50,090
Now we are talking!

889
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:52,025
That's when the singing
and dancing starts.

890
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:54,861
♪ <i>We're gonna Have
a party tonight! ♪</i>

891
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,731
It's when he hits the layer o'
whiskey fudge he'll get emotional.

892
00:39:57,764 --> 00:40:00,433
She was the only
woman I ever loved!

893
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,502
He might do something reckless.

894
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:03,837
I'll give her a call.

895
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,406
What harm could it do?

896
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,542
Hello, Gwennie? It's Basil.

897
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,811
I just wanted to say,
I've always loved you.

898
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:12,913
I love you so much. What?

899
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:14,481
It's Basil Bond.

900
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:15,858
We sat together in
chemistry at school.

901
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:17,884
No, no, don't hang up!

902
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,620
Finally, some old port from the
back of the cupboard, and...

903
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,090
Hmm.

904
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:26,358
Let's go.

905
00:40:26,392 --> 00:40:27,494
Noodle, let's go.

906
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,765
Why don't they fly away?

907
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:34,701
I don't know. Perhaps they
haven't thought of it.

908
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,736
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm serious.

909
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,505
That's the thing
about flamingos.

910
00:40:38,538 --> 00:40:40,440
They need someone
to show 'em the way.

911
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:41,474
Huh.

912
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,713
Giraffe.

913
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,750
Giraffe. Giraffe.

914
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,787
Ah! Giraffe.

915
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:01,728
You have got to
learn how to read.

916
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:03,063
Why?

917
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:04,698
You were nearly
eaten by a tiger.

918
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,175
"Nearly" is the key
word there, Noodle.

919
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,868
I've nearly been eaten
by a lot of things,

920
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:09,870
and none of them got
more than a nibble.

921
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:12,973
Giraffe.

922
00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:14,441
Okay, I'll learn how to read.

923
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:38,431
Good evening, Miss, um...

924
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:39,933
- Abigail.
- Abigail.

925
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,669
Whoa! Easy, now.

926
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:44,004
I brought acacia mints.

927
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:52,178
Oh.

928
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:55,148
Giraffes are just crazy
about my acacia mints.

929
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:56,917
Love 'em more than
anything else.

930
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,818
Except being scratched
under the chin, you see?

931
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,989
You wanna give it a go, Noodle?

932
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,624
Me?

933
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:05,959
Yeah. Why not?

934
00:42:07,627 --> 00:42:08,762
Okay.

935
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,502
- Ugh!
- Oh!

936
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:17,604
Think she likes you.

937
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,941
Miss Abigail,

938
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:23,510
if my colleague here
gives you a good scratch,

939
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:24,987
do you think you could
possibly spare us

940
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,446
a pint or two of your milk?

941
00:42:31,518 --> 00:42:34,220
So, have you done this before?

942
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:36,589
Once. In Africa.

943
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,792
Magnificent beast.

944
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:41,094
- Was she wild?
- Wild?

945
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:43,596
She was absolutely furious.

946
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,498
You sure can be silly, Willy.

947
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,867
I suppose that's
true-dle, Noodle.

948
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,602
True-dle?

949
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:51,104
That doesn't work, does it?

950
00:42:51,137 --> 00:42:52,806
Nothing rhymes with Noodle.

951
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,208
Where'd you get
that name, anyway?

952
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,241
Doesn't matter.

953
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,111
No, go on.

954
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:02,047
This.

955
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:06,586
It's all I have of
my real parents. See?

956
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:10,056
"N" for Noodle.
Or Nora, or Nina,

957
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,059
or nothing at all.

958
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,627
Can't you trace the owner?

959
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:15,929
You don't think I've tried?

960
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,999
When I was a kid,

961
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:22,235
I always hoped that
I'd find my parents.

962
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:26,039
And they'd live in this beautiful
old building full of books.

963
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:30,010
My mom, she'd be waiting
there for me at the door,

964
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,811
and I'd run into her arms.

965
00:43:31,845 --> 00:43:34,814
She'd give me this big hug
like she'd never let me go.

966
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:39,753
But then I realized it
was just a stupid dream.

967
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,657
There's nothing
stupid about that.

968
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:46,292
Isn't there?

969
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,828
I know things haven't
been easy for you, Noodle.

970
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:50,630
But they're gonna get better.

971
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:53,633
I'm not gonna let you rot
in that Wash House forever.

972
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:54,868
You promise?

973
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:56,669
I can do better than that.

974
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:59,606
I pinkie promise.

975
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,908
And that's the most
solemn vow there is.

976
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,746
Get scratchin'.

977
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,183
We don't have long until that
guard comes to-dle, Noodle.

978
00:44:10,216 --> 00:44:12,886
- To-dle!
- It's not even a word!

979
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:14,687
Oh.

980
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,322

Mr. Wonka! A word in
private, if I may.

1020
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:18,972
Certainly, Officer.

1021
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,174
- Be on your way, Affable.
- Are you sure, sir?

1022
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:23,810
Oh, yeah. This is
between me and Mr. Wonka.

1023
00:47:23,843 --> 00:47:25,120
You better get
outta here, Noodle.

1024
00:47:25,144 --> 00:47:26,846
- But Willy...
- Don't worry about me.

1025
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:28,023
I've talked my way out of
tighter spots than this.

1026
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:29,287
I'll meet you back at the cart.

1027
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:32,852
Now, Officer, if this
is about Abigail...

1028
00:47:32,885 --> 00:47:34,254
I got a message for you, pal.

1029
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:35,321
Whoa! No.

1030
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:40,360
Do not sell chocolate
in this town!

1031
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:42,061
You got it?

1032
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,131
Not really, I'm afraid.

1033
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:48,001
Oh, so you got a mouth
on you, huh, Candy Man?

1034
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,436
I said...

1035
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,238
Don't sell chocolate!

1036
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:55,241
You hear me that time?

1037
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,043
I have water in my ears.

1038
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:58,878
Oh.

1039
00:47:58,911 --> 00:48:00,880
Yeah, that... You've...

1040
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:02,982
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

1041
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,084
Listen, I'm sorry.

1042
00:48:05,118 --> 00:48:06,953
I'm all outta whack.

1043
00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:09,822
Truth is, I don't
wanna be doin' this.

1044
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:11,425
I don't want you
to be doing this.

1045
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,192
But I still gotta
give ya a message.

1046
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:15,361
Sell chocolate in
this town again,

1047
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,997
you're gonna get more
than a bonk on the head.

1048
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:19,365
I don't have a bonk on the head.

1049
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:23,970
What is with me today? I...

1050
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:25,523
- Can you give me just a second?
- Sure.

1051
00:48:28,941 --> 00:48:30,611
Lord Bleachowitz.

1052
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:34,481
Mrs. Scrubitt. Your eyes are
like two rabbit droppings

1053
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:35,848
in a couple of bowls

1054
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:37,250
- of custard.
- Oh!

1055
00:48:37,283 --> 00:48:39,052
You really do have
a way with words.

1056
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,953
See you downstairs.

1057
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:42,955
Geronimo!

1058
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,857
Ah, Mr. Wonka.

1059
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,527
Good of you to join us.

1060
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,895
- Not late, am I?
- Well, no.

1061
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:50,396
Cutting it a bit fine, but...

1062
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,964
Has Tiddles been
pulling his weight?

1063
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:53,066
As a matter of fact,

1064
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,310
Tiddles has been
a very good boy,

1065
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:56,336
and productivity is up 30%.

1066
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,004
We took the afternoon off.

1067
00:48:58,037 --> 00:48:59,138
But that's not the point.

1068
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:00,441
This is the point.

1069
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:01,908
- Not now, Larry.
- Sorry.

1070
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,477
The point is...

1071
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:04,911
Where have you been?

1072
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:07,648
And why do you smell of giraffe?

1073
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:09,282
Guess I owe you
guys an explanation.

1074
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:11,184
- Mm.
- The truth is,

1075
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:12,919
I'm a chocolate maker.

1076
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:16,089
Not just any chocolate.
The best in the world.

1077
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,592
Ah, well, Noodle's flattering
me, but she's right.

1078
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,293
They're exquisite.

1079
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:23,162
Plan is to sell chocolate
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt.

1080
00:49:23,196 --> 00:49:25,331
At least, that was
the plan, until...

1081
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:26,999
Oh, let me guess.

1082
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:30,169
You had a little run-in
with the Chief of Police?

1083
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:31,505
How do you know that?

1084
00:49:31,538 --> 00:49:34,508
Because I was
Slugworth's accountant.

1085
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,275
For a week, at least.

1086
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:38,277
<i>His regular bookkeeper
was off sick.</i>

1087
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:40,146
- Station, please.
<i>- And I was called</i>

1088
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,348
<i>halfway across the
country to take his place.</i>

1089
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:44,283
Good evening, Mr. Slugworth.

1090
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:47,186
I just need your signature on...

1091
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,122
<i>Seemed a straightforward job.</i>

1092
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:50,256
Oh.

1093
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:52,392
<i>Until I realized</i>

1094
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:54,994
<i>there were two sets of books.</i>

1095
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:57,130
<i>One for the authorities,</i>

1096
00:49:57,163 --> 00:50:00,233
<i>and one which told the truth.</i>

1097
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:04,003
<i>Slugworth, Fickelgruber,
and Prodnose</i>

1098
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:06,038
<i>have been in cahoots for years.</i>

1099
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:08,642
<i>A sort of chocolate
cartel, if you will.</i>

1100
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,943
<i>They've been watering
down their chocolate</i>

1101
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:13,547
<i>and storing the excess
in a secret vault</i>

1102
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,516
<i>deep beneath the cathedral,</i>

1103
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:18,351
<i>guarded round the clock
by a corrupt cleric</i>

1104
00:50:18,384 --> 00:50:22,589
<i>and 500 chocoholic monks.</i>

1105
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:26,560
<i>The only way in is down a
secret elevator, and past</i>

1106
00:50:26,593 --> 00:50:29,061
<i>the Mistress of the Keys.</i>

1107
00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:31,097
<i>A subterranean sentinel...</i>

1108
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,232
<i>who hasn't seen
sunlight in years.</i>

1109
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:35,034
<i>Good evening.</i>

1110
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:36,579
<i>There's thousands of
gallons of chocolate</i>

1111
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:40,106
<i>down there, and the
Cartel use it to bribe,</i>

1112
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:43,276
<i>blackmail, and bludgeon
the competition.</i>

1113
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:45,412
- I do not care that they
were school children...

1114
00:50:45,446 --> 00:50:48,080
they were in our way. Next
time, put your foot down.

1115
00:50:48,114 --> 00:50:49,483
Miss Bon-Bon?

1116
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,184
Good morning, Mr. Slugworth.

1117
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:53,687
From now on, I'll be keeping
the ledger in the vault.

1118
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,987
Very good, sir.

1119
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,524
Oh, and Mr. Crunch?

1120
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:00,359
Yes?

1121
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:01,662
You're fired.

1122
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:04,997
Very good, sir.

1123
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:08,535
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka,</i>

1124
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:11,605
<i>but they've got you right
where they want you.</i>

1125
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:14,441
<i>You can't get a shop
without selling chocolate,</i>

1126
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:18,277
<i>and you can't sell
chocolate without a shop.</i>

1127
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:22,315
Hey, Noodle!

1128
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:24,050
Noodle! Psst!

1129
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:26,620
What is it, Willy?

1130
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,020
Watch out.

1131
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:29,054
Whoa!

1132
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,229
What's this for?

1133
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:39,666
Your wages. A lifetime
supply, remember?

1134
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,400
You didn't have to do that.

1135
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,003
Of course I did. I
gave you my word.

1136
00:51:44,705 --> 00:51:47,106
Well, thanks.

1137
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,409
- I've got something for you, too.
- For me?

1138
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:56,617
What's this?

1139
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,553
- Glass half full?
- Other way up.

1140
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:01,220
Glass half empty.

1141
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:03,557
It's an "A." Your
first letter.

1142
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,592
I'm teaching you to read.

1143
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,494
Oh, Noodle.

1144
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:09,506
Well, I can't have my business
partner eaten by a tiger.

1145
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,364
Or nearly eaten.

1146
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:13,366
So we're still partners?

1147
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:15,802
Sure, but I don't know how
we're gonna sell any chocolate.

1148
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:18,438
Every time the police show up,
you'd have to vanish into thin air.

1149
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:20,373
Like a magician.

1150
00:52:20,407 --> 00:52:21,742
Right!

1151
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:23,777
Yeah, but it's one thing
when you're onstage.

1152
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,513
You have ropes and
pulleys and trapdoors.

1153
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,080
There's none of
those on the street.

1154
00:52:28,114 --> 00:52:30,082
As a matter of fact, there are.

1155
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:32,184
There are trapdoors
all over the city.

1156
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:33,854
They're called storm drains.

1157
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:35,288
I'd be happy to show you around

1158
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:36,690
if you cut me in on the action.

1159
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,357
If you're recruiting,

1160
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:39,860
I'd do anything
to get out of here

1161
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:41,394
and make up with my wife.

1162
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:44,163
I don't have any
practical skills, but,

1163
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:46,667
I can talk like I'm under water.

1164
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,268
And if you need someone
to handle communications,

1165
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,771
I'm your woman.

1166
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,773
Lottie?

1167
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:54,508
What? Why you all
staring at me?

1168
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,543
I did not know she could speak.

1169
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,779
- I thought you were a mime.
- No,

1170
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:01,748
I actually used to work
at the telephone exchange.

1171
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:04,651
But back then, I was
quite the chatterbox.

1172
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,085
But since I came here,

1173
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:09,255
I haven't had much
to chat about.

1174
00:53:09,288 --> 00:53:10,791
Far be it from me

1175
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:12,893
to pour cold water
on all your fun,

1176
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:15,495
but if Mrs. Scrubitt catches
you trying to escape,

1177
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:18,297
you'll all get six
months in the coop.

1178
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:19,866
So just think about that

1179
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,769
before getting involved in
this harebrained scheme.

1180
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:25,271
But it's not
harebrained, Abacus.

1181
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:27,407
Willy's chocolates
are incredible.

1182
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:28,875
Try one.

1183
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,510
That's very kind of you, Noodle.

1184
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:33,112
I don't care how good
his chocolates are.

1185
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,182
When do we start?

1186
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:49,596
I guess what I'm trying
to say, Barbara, is, um,

1187
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,198
- will you marry me?
- Oh.

1188
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,700
I dunno, Colin.

1189
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,277
You're a lovely man, but
I'm looking for someone

1190
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:56,613
to sweep me off
my feet. You know,

1191
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:59,406
whisk me off to a
life of adventure.

1192
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:00,674
Could that be you?

1193
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,410
- No.
- Oh.

1194
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:05,879
Not with my chronic
lack of self-confidence.

1195
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:08,615
- Uh, I best be off.
- Oh, but Colin...

1196
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:10,417
Sorry to have wasted
your time, Barbara.

1197
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:12,318
Uh, taxi!

1198
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:19,926
Uh, <i>monsieur,</i> can I help you?

1199
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,928
Oh, waiter.

1200
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:24,931

01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,268
What the devil?

1306
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:04,871
Let me out of here. I
demand to be released.

1307
01:00:04,904 --> 01:00:06,873
Incredible. It can speak.

1308
01:00:06,906 --> 01:00:08,274
Well, of course I can speak.

1309
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:09,976
Now let me out of here,
or I shall shriek.

1310
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,845
- Wow.
- Let me out!

1311
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:14,114
Not until I take a
good look at you.

1312
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:17,050
Wow.

1313
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,785
Good evening.

1314
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:21,021
So you're the funny little
man who's been following me.

1315
01:00:21,054 --> 01:00:23,256
"Funny little
man"? How dare you.

1316
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:24,724
I will have you know

1317
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:26,693
that I am a perfectly
respectable size

1318
01:00:26,726 --> 01:00:28,294
for an Oompa Loompa.

1319
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:30,597
An Oompa-what-now?

1320
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:33,075
In fact, in Loompaland, I am
regarded as something of a whopper.

1321
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:34,901
They call me Lofty.

1322
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:36,903
So, I will thank you
to stop gawping at me

1323
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:38,180
as though I was
something unpleasant

1324
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:39,806
you'd found in
your handkerchief.

1325
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,176
I find it uncomfortable
and, frankly, rude.

1326
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:44,644
Um...

1327
01:00:44,677 --> 01:00:46,012
- Sorry.
- Now let me out of here.

1328
01:00:46,046 --> 01:00:47,881
You have absolutely no right

1329
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:50,116
to go around embottling
innocent strangers.

1330
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,818
Innocent?

1331
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:53,953
Hold on, you've been
stealing from me. For years.

1332
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:55,655
Well, you started it.

1333
01:00:55,688 --> 01:00:56,723
Me?

1334
01:00:56,756 --> 01:00:59,025
You stole our cocoa beans.

1335
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:01,761
What are you talking about?

1336
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:04,731
Do you mean that you
don't even remember?

1337
01:01:04,764 --> 01:01:06,366
Remember what?

1338
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:08,234
The day you...

1339
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:11,237
destroyed my life.

1340
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:13,673
No, I don't remember that.

1341
01:01:13,706 --> 01:01:14,908
Well then, young man.

1342
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:16,810
Allow me to refresh your memory

1343
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:19,879
in the form of a song
so ruinously catchy

1344
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:21,915

leave your mind.

1345
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:24,617
Oh, I don't think
I wanna hear that.

1346
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:25,752

Good day, sir.

1397
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:23,236
But that's my last jar!

1398
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:25,338
I said good day.

1399
01:03:27,874 --> 01:03:29,842
<i>He came back?</i>

1400
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,878
Yes, Noodle, but this
time I set a trap.

1401
01:03:31,911 --> 01:03:33,179
And he walked right into it.

1402
01:03:33,947 --> 01:03:35,315
So, where is he?

1403
01:03:35,348 --> 01:03:37,350
Ah, well, we had a
fight, you see. He won.

1404
01:03:37,383 --> 01:03:38,851
Hit me on the head
with a frying pan

1405
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:40,186
and jumped out of the window.

1406
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,188
Of course he did.

1407
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:44,958
You don't believe me, do you?

1408
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:46,226
Honestly? No.

1409
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:47,327
No!

1410
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,394
No.

1411
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,196
- No.
- Definitely not.

1412
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,264
But,

1413
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:53,132
as it so happens,

1414
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,867
we don't need to
sell chocolate today.

1415
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:56,035
And why is that?

1416
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:57,203
You know that shop?

1417
01:03:57,237 --> 01:03:58,871
The one you've been dreaming of?

1418
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:16,789
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

1419
01:04:16,823 --> 01:04:19,025
It may need a little work.

1420
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:22,972
Looks like someone
left the water running

1421
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,064
twenty years ago and the
ceiling fell through.

1422
01:04:25,098 --> 01:04:27,534
And the ceiling above that,
and the ceiling above that.

1423
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:29,869
But that means we can afford it.

1424
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:31,371
For a week, anyway.

1425
01:04:31,405 --> 01:04:33,206
And we'd finally be legitimate.

1426
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:34,874
The police wouldn't
have any excuse

1427
01:04:34,907 --> 01:04:37,143
to keep bothering us.

1428
01:04:37,176 --> 01:04:39,580
So, what do you think, Willy?

1429
01:04:39,613 --> 01:04:40,813
Do you like it?

1430
01:04:43,149 --> 01:04:44,384
Do I like it?

1431
01:04:47,488 --> 01:04:49,456
Noodle, it's just as
I always imagined.

1432
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,892
No, scratch that, it's
better than I imagined.

1433
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:54,428
I mean, look at this place.

1434
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:56,497
I mean, yeah, it's a wreck,
but... the potential!

1435
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,499
The bones!

1436
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:00,410
You mark my words, this is
gonna be the best chocolate shop

1437
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:02,368
- the world has ever seen.
- Whoo!

1438
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,179
You won't be scrub-scrubbin'
much longer, Noodle.

1439
01:05:04,203 --> 01:05:05,838
We'll all be free.

1440
01:05:05,872 --> 01:05:07,408
As free as flamingos!

1441
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,287
There's six of them in total.

1442
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:22,889
Including the little girl.

1443
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:25,258
She seems to be the
brains of the operation.

1444
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:28,261
They're based out of a laundry
called Scrubitt and Bleacher.

1445
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:30,396
Scrubitt's?

1446
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:32,599
That's right. Why, you know it?

1447
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:35,101
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

1448
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:36,570
They just rented a shop.

1449
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:38,871
So, legally, I can't
touch them. But illegally,

1450
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:41,341
I'm happy to do
whatever you guys want.

1451
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,951
You want 'em all to
have a little accident?

1452
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:44,210
In which they die?

1453
01:05:44,243 --> 01:05:45,878
Not a problem.

1454
01:05:45,912 --> 01:05:47,390
But it's gonna cost you
a lot more chocolate.

1455
01:05:47,414 --> 01:05:49,182
It's all right, Chief.

1456
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:51,250
And also, I'd, uh, be
grateful for an advance.

1457
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:53,386
'Cause the last
boxes you gave me...

1458
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,954
they're gone.

1459
01:05:54,987 --> 01:05:56,189
All of them?

1460
01:05:56,222 --> 01:05:57,667
I've been eating these
little paper cases

1461
01:05:57,691 --> 01:05:59,493
for the... for the
past three days.

1462
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,270
You know, you think they're
gonna give you the same hit.

1463
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,430
They don't.

1464
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:04,665
Oh.

1465
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:06,265
There you go, Chief.

1466
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:08,134
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1467
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,370
You stand down for now.

1468
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:12,163
We'll give you a call
when the time is right.

1469
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:19,446
What is it, Arthur?

1470
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,415
The girl.

1471
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:23,288
You don't really think
it could be her, do you?

1472
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,619
I do.

1473
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:28,522
You always assured us she
wouldn't be a problem.

1474
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:30,524
He's right. You did assure us.

1475
01:06:30,557 --> 01:06:32,291
And she won't be.

1476
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:33,694
<i>Nor will Wonka.</i>

1477
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,463
<i>I'll see to it, personally.</i>

1478
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,667
Who is it? What d'you want?

1479
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:46,507
Mr. Slugworth.

1480
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,907
Just a minute, sir.

1481
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,077
Good evening.

1482
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,980
- Good evening.
- -Who is it, puffy-wu...

1483
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:55,248
Stone me.

1484
01:06:55,281 --> 01:06:56,650
It's Mr. Slugworth.

1485
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:59,118
To what do we owe the honor?

1486
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:01,722
You have a guest. A Mr. Wonka?

1487
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:03,557
He's been sneaking
out to sell chocolate

1488
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,158
with the help of
your serving girl.

1489
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:06,993
Why, that little brat.

1490
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:08,595
Well, quite.

1491
01:07:08,629 --> 01:07:11,397
I wondered if you might help
me put an end to their...

1492
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:14,033
business.

1493
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:24,343
Here we go, Mamma.

1494
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:37,323
Ladies and gentlemen,
greetings to you all,

1495
01:07:37,356 --> 01:07:40,594
and welcome to Wonka's.

1496
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:42,596
Tremendous things are in store,

1497
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:45,766
both literally and
metaphorically.

1498
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:47,366
What?

1499
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,469
In there?

1500
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:50,603

That comes to 89 sovereigns.

1560
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,659
A bargain at twice the price.

1561
01:11:32,693 --> 01:11:33,960
Thank you, sir.

1562
01:11:33,994 --> 01:11:35,996
And how would you
like your change?

1563
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:38,264
Spendable or edible?

1564
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:39,766
Oh, edible, please.

1565
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:43,470
Enjoy.

1566
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:45,706
And, uh, don't forget
to eat your basket.

1567
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:47,708
Oh.

1568
01:11:47,741 --> 01:11:50,376
Abacus, that man just
gave us 100 sovereigns.

1569
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,679
I know, Noodle!

1570
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:53,947
Who's next?

1571
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,980
- That'll be me.
- Me!

1572
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:00,554
Uh...

1573
01:12:00,587 --> 01:12:01,621
Mr. Wonka?

1574
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:02,756
Yes?

1575
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:05,525
What's going on here?

1576
01:12:05,559 --> 01:12:06,893
Oh, my goodness.

1577
01:12:06,927 --> 01:12:08,327
That's impossible.

1578
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,496
Unless...

1579
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,434
Yeti sweat?

1580
01:12:14,468 --> 01:12:15,869
Yeti sweat?

1581
01:12:15,902 --> 01:12:17,704
The most powerful hair
potion in the world.

1582
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:19,940
But I didn't put it in there.

1583
01:12:19,973 --> 01:12:22,642
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention, please!

1584
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:24,578
There appears to be a
manufacturing error.

1585
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:26,378
Nobody eat the flowers!

1586
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:28,548
Uh, why not?

1587
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:29,950
What's wrong with them?

1588
01:12:29,983 --> 01:12:31,651
What's the matter
with this toadstool?

1589
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:34,286
My daughter took one bite,
and just look at her!

1590
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,355
There's nothing wrong
with the chocolate milk,

1591
01:12:36,388 --> 01:12:37,424
is there?

1592
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:38,792
I'm terribly sorry, everyone,

1593
01:12:38,825 --> 01:12:40,727
and I don't know how
to explain this, but...

1594
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:42,796
it appears that the
chocolates have been poisoned!

1595
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:44,030
Poisoned?

1596
01:12:44,064 --> 01:12:45,966
- Poisoned?
- He poisoned my child!

1597
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:47,667
I didn't... I
didn't poison them.

1598
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:49,469
I want my money back.

1599
01:12:49,503 --> 01:12:50,670
I want compensation.

1600
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:51,938
I want revenge.

1601
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:54,608
Whoa!

1602
01:12:59,913 --> 01:13:00,914
No, no! Please!

1603
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:08,889
This is what you get for
mustach-ing my daughter!

1604
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:14,946
I'll wait for you. Help! I have
to get away from this place.

1605
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:18,064
And that, I believe,

1606
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:20,967
is the end of Wonka's
Chocolate Shop.

1607
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:41,888
I don't understand. What...

1608
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,390
What...

1609
01:13:46,459 --> 01:13:47,594
What happened?

1610
01:13:47,627 --> 01:13:49,395
Isn't it obvious?

1611
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:51,097
The Chocolate Cartel.

1612
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,837
It's okay, Willy.
We can rebuild.

1613
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,104
We can start again.

1614
01:13:58,138 --> 01:13:59,706
There's no point, Noodle.

1615
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:03,043
It didn't work.

1616
01:14:03,076 --> 01:14:04,845
What do you mean?

1617
01:14:04,878 --> 01:14:06,580
She promised she would be here.

1618
01:14:08,648 --> 01:14:10,483
She wasn't.

1619
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:12,118
You didn't actually
think that...

1620
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:13,152
No, I did.

1621
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:17,691
Stupid dream.

1622
01:14:17,724 --> 01:14:19,593
Don't say that, Willy.
Please don't ever...

1623
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:21,561
Come on, Noodle.

1624
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:24,130
I think Mr. Wonka
needs to be alone.

1625
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:40,580
<i>Every good thing in this
world started with a dream.</i>

1626
01:14:44,084 --> 01:14:47,754
<i>So you hold on to yours.</i>

1627
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:51,424
<i>And when you do share
chocolate with the world, oh...</i>

1628
01:14:53,026 --> 01:14:55,695
<i>I'll be right there beside ya.</i>

1629
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:00,399
Terrible shame,
what happened here.

1630
01:15:02,769 --> 01:15:04,204
Take it you're responsible?

1631
01:15:04,237 --> 01:15:07,107
Us? Oh, no. Well,
not personally.

1632
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,610
We may have encouraged
Mrs. Scrubitt

1633
01:15:10,644 --> 01:15:12,679
to enhance your creations.

1634
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:14,648
We paid her to poison them.

1635
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,150
- Yes, thank you, Gerald.
- You're welcome.

1636
01:15:17,183 --> 01:15:19,452
So why have you come?

1637
01:15:19,486 --> 01:15:21,554
- To gloat?
- Oh, no, Mr. Wonka,

1638
01:15:21,588 --> 01:15:23,657
I don't waste my time
with that sort of thing.

1639
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,960
We've come to offer you a deal.

1640
01:15:26,993 --> 01:15:32,565
This is the precise amount
you owe Mrs. Scrubitt.

1641
01:15:32,599 --> 01:15:34,834
This is for the number cruncher,

1642
01:15:35,769 --> 01:15:37,003
the plumber,

1643
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:39,472
the telephonist,

1644
01:15:39,506 --> 01:15:42,442
the so-called funny-man,

1645
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:44,644
and this...

1646
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:47,881
is for the girl.

1647
01:15:47,914 --> 01:15:49,916
Now, we put in a
bit extra for her.

1648
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,751
So that she can get
a place to live,

1649
01:15:51,785 --> 01:15:52,886
clothes, toys...

1650
01:15:54,154 --> 01:15:55,588
books.

1651
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,225
Oh, yes, Mr. Wonka.

1652
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:03,630
You could change her life.
Change all their lives.

1653
01:16:05,298 --> 01:16:06,633
And what would I have to do?

1654
01:16:07,534 --> 01:16:08,568
Leave town.

1655
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:10,670
Oh, and, um,

1656
01:16:11,805 --> 01:16:15,208
never make chocolate again.

1657
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:17,811
There's a boat
sailing at midnight.

1658
01:16:17,844 --> 01:16:19,646
<i>And for their sake,
as much as your own,</i>

1659
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,815

Your ticket. Uh, one-way.

1671
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,643
To the North Pole.

1672
01:17:23,676 --> 01:17:25,578

Yeah, it's basically economy.

I mean, yeah, you get
a little more legroom.

1675
01:17:28,915 --> 01:17:30,316
A complimentary
packet of peanuts.

1676
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,985
Is it worth the extra?

1677
01:17:32,018 --> 01:17:35,221
- I don't know.

1678

Oh, I'm not going to let you

Not till you've paid your debt.

1690
01:18:54,968 --> 01:18:58,138
But I bring glad
tidings on that score.

1691

What's that?

1692
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,141
I've been doing my sums.

1693
01:19:01,174 --> 01:19:03,843
One more jar, and we're even.

1694
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:06,980
Or, if you prefer, I
will accept half a jar

1695
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:08,982
of those rather
amusing Hoverchocs.

1696
01:19:09,015 --> 01:19:10,984
You're outta luck.

1697
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:13,386
I don't make chocolate anymore.

1698
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,998
Oh, dear, please don't tell me you're going
to go through with this ridiculous deal?

1699
01:19:16,022 --> 01:19:17,056
I have to.

1700
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,159
For Noodle.

1701
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:20,927
I promised her a better life.

1702
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:23,263
I pinkie promised.

1703
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:24,931
You should stand up
to those bullies.

1704
01:19:24,964 --> 01:19:26,399
Give 'em the old one-two.

1705
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,168
That's what an Oompa
Loompa would do.

1706
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:32,705
But if you are determined

1707
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:34,974
to just sit there feeling
sorry for yourself,

1708
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:36,743
I am going flat.

1709
01:19:36,776 --> 01:19:38,278
Good night, sir.

1710
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:48,154
Huh.

1711
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,993
What is it?

1712
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:55,728
No, nothing.

1713
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:58,465
Well, it's obviously something
because you said, "Huh."

1714
01:19:58,499 --> 01:20:00,133
I'm sorry. Forget it.

1715
01:20:01,834 --> 01:20:04,137
Very well.

1716
01:20:08,775 --> 01:20:10,043
Huh.

1717
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:11,412
Oh, you did it again.

1718
01:20:11,445 --> 01:20:12,955
Tell me what it is,
or I shall poke you

1719
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:14,256
quite viciously with
a cocktail stick.

1720
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,182
Look. Where Slugworth
shook my hand.

1721
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:18,251
His ring left a mark. See?

1722
01:20:18,284 --> 01:20:20,253
It's an "A," surrounded by "S"s.

1723
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:22,822
So what? His name
is Arthur Slugworth.

1724
01:20:22,855 --> 01:20:24,425
It's probably a family ring.

1725
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,159
Yes, but Noodle has
one just like it.

1726
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:28,027
- Noodle?
- Uh-huh.

1727
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:31,798
Why would Noodle the orphan
have a Slugworth family ring?

1728
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:33,467
There's only one
reason I can think of.

1729
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,168
Which is?

1730
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:36,779
And if I'm correct, Noodle
could be in grave danger.

1731
01:20:36,803 --> 01:20:38,871
Well, come on,
Wonka. Spit it out.

1732
01:20:38,905 --> 01:20:40,773
Produce your owl
pellet of wisdom.

1733
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:42,242
There's no time.
I gotta get back.

1734
01:20:42,275 --> 01:20:44,177
- Captain!
- Wonka?

1735
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:47,481
Come back here. Wonka!
I demand an explanation.

1736
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:48,514
Captain?

1737
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:54,220
On second thoughts, the
explanation can wait.

1738
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:55,288
Good day to you.

1739
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:05,898
Well, gentlemen,

1740
01:21:05,932 --> 01:21:08,535
one dead chocolatier,
as requested.

1741
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,871
Miss Bon-Bon?

1742
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:13,239
<i>Yes, Mr. Slugworth?</i>

1743
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:14,774
Give the chief his chocolate.

1744
01:21:23,316 --> 01:21:25,084
<i>My, my.</i>

1745
01:21:25,118 --> 01:21:27,920
What a lot o' long
faces this morning.

1746
01:21:27,954 --> 01:21:30,923
It's almost as though you lot
had a sneaky little scheme

1747
01:21:30,957 --> 01:21:33,026
to try and wriggle
out of your contracts.

1748
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:36,162
Which spectacularly misfired.

1749
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:38,097
But I've got some
good news for you lot,

1750
01:21:38,131 --> 01:21:39,932
not that you deserve it.

1751
01:21:39,966 --> 01:21:43,202
Your friend, Mr. Wonka, done
a deal with Mr. Slugworth.

1752
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:44,571
What?

1753
01:21:44,605 --> 01:21:47,907
Gave up on his dream to
settle your accounts.

1754
01:21:48,975 --> 01:21:50,343
- Mr. Crunch.
- Present.

1755
01:21:54,347 --> 01:21:55,416
You're free to go.

1756
01:21:57,016 --> 01:21:58,318
Scram, bookworm.

1757
01:21:58,351 --> 01:21:59,852
- Bell.
- Hello.

1758
01:21:59,886 --> 01:22:01,020
Sling yer hook.

1759
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:02,388
Benz.

1760
01:22:02,423 --> 01:22:04,223
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

1761
01:22:04,257 --> 01:22:05,559
Chucklesworth.

1762
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:07,193
You've been a terrible audience.

1763
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:08,895
Good night!

1764
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:10,072
Yeah, well, you ain't been
much of a comedian, mate.

1765
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:12,365
- I know.
- Hey, Larry.

1766
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:15,134
Keep going. You've
got something.

1767
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,437
You scare me.

1768
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,440
And finally, Noodle.

1769
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:22,175
Biggest pile o' the lot.

1770
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:24,611
But this isn't to pay your bill.

1771
01:22:24,645 --> 01:22:27,080
This is to keep you here.

1772
01:22:27,113 --> 01:22:28,482
What do you mean?

1773
01:22:28,515 --> 01:22:30,950
My friend, Mr. Slugworth,

1774
01:22:30,983 --> 01:22:32,985
doesn't think nasty
little urchins like you

1775
01:22:33,019 --> 01:22:34,187
should be out on the streets,

1776
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,888
lowering the tone.

1777
01:22:35,922 --> 01:22:38,024
So, he gave me this money

1778
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:41,495
to keep you down in the
Wash House for good.

1779
01:22:41,528 --> 01:22:44,297
And I'm only too
happy to oblige.

1780
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,666
- I hate you!
- Hey!

1781
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:47,066
Hey, hey, hey.

1782
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,001
Look at her go,
Lord Bleachowitz.

1783
01:22:49,035 --> 01:22:50,671
Lord Bleachowitz?

1784
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:52,539
You don't still think
he's a lord, do you?

1785
01:22:52,573 --> 01:22:54,006
What?

1786
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,142
We made it up, you
stupid old hag.

1787
01:22:56,175 --> 01:22:57,910
She's... she's lying.

1788
01:22:57,944 --> 01:23:00,279
Right, that's it, you
horrible little brat.

1789
01:23:00,313 --> 01:23:03,049
You're goin' in
the coop, my girl.

1790
01:23:03,082 --> 01:23:05,952
And you! Take them
dungarees off,

1791
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:08,955
you... you peasant.

1792
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:10,691
But Puffy-wuffy.

1793
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:12,158
I wuv you.

1794
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:40,654
Hello, Noodle.

1795
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:43,557
Willy. I thought you'd gone.

1796
01:23:44,257 --> 01:23:45,526
I did.

1797
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:47,293
Slugworth promised
you a better life,

1798
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:49,630
but he didn't exactly keep
his side of the bargain.

1799
01:23:49,663 --> 01:23:51,498
So I came back. We all did.

1800
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:53,065
- Hey, Noodle.
- How do?

1801
01:23:53,099 --> 01:23:54,568
Hey. Surprise!

1802
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:56,302
He wants me locked up forever.

1803
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:58,004
Yeah, well, that figures.

1804
01:23:58,037 --> 01:24:00,273
Why? What's he got against me?

1805
01:24:00,306 --> 01:24:02,308
I don't know,
Noodle. Not for sure.

1806
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:04,521
All I know for certain is that
you won't be safe until Slugworth

1807
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:07,514
is behind bars.

1808
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:10,451
And how exactly is that
supposed to happen?

1809
01:24:10,484 --> 01:24:12,385
Abacus. You said
the Cartel keep

1810
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:13,696
a record of all
their dirty deeds.

1811
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,388
In the green ledger, yes.

1812
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:16,989
So if we can get hold o' that,

1813
01:24:17,023 --> 01:24:18,300
we can prove that they
poisoned our chocolate.

1814
01:24:18,324 --> 01:24:19,636
Scrubitt and Bleacher
would go to jail,

1815
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,993
and we'll all be free.

1816
01:24:21,027 --> 01:24:23,129
Uh, yes, but may I remind you,

1817
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:25,064
they keep that
ledger in a vault.

1818
01:24:25,097 --> 01:24:26,533
Guarded by a corrupt cleric.

1819
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,035
And 500 chocoholic monks.

1820
01:24:29,068 --> 01:24:31,404
- Mm-hmm.
- That's all true.

1821
01:24:31,438 --> 01:24:34,040
But I went for a long,
cold swim this morning.

1822
01:24:34,073 --> 01:24:35,485
Cold water is very
good for the brain.

1823
01:24:35,509 --> 01:24:37,376
Stimulates the neural pathways.

1824
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:39,413
And after just four
miles, it came to me.

1825
01:24:39,446 --> 01:24:41,214
How an ingenious orphan,

1826
01:24:41,247 --> 01:24:42,381
an accountant, a plumber,

1827
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,418
a telephone exchange operator,

1828
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:46,152
and a man who can
speak underwater,

1829
01:24:46,185 --> 01:24:47,488
could combine those talents,

1830
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:49,355
and pull off the
heist of the century.

1831
01:24:49,388 --> 01:24:52,258
But even if we do get
our hands on that ledger,

1832
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:55,127
the Cartel will simply bribe
their way out of trouble.

1833
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,330
It's what they do.

1834
01:24:57,363 --> 01:24:59,098
The greedy beat
the needy, Willy.

1835
01:24:59,131 --> 01:25:01,067
It's just the way of the world.

1836
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,569
You're right, Noodle.

1837
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:04,447
I guess that's why there's
one other thing to do.

1838
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,773
- What's that?
- Change the world.

1839
01:25:10,276 --> 01:25:11,310
Whoa!

1840
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:13,780
Where do we start?

1841
01:25:26,392 --> 01:25:28,361
'Scuse me, sir.

1842
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:31,063
Could you spare a piece of
chocolate for a starvin' orphan?

1843
01:25:31,097 --> 01:25:34,568
I'm sorry, my child. I
don't have any on me.

1844
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,102
Oh.

1845
01:25:37,838 --> 01:25:39,506
Then have some acacia mints.

1846
01:25:40,607 --> 01:25:41,608
Yes!

1847
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:47,213
"To Basil Bond,
employee of the week."

1848
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:48,515
Oh, that's lovely...

1849
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:02,361
Everything all right back there?

1850
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:04,798
Everything's fine.
Isn't it, Abigail?

1851
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,535
Tell her she might want to duck.

1852
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:10,336
Tell her she might wanna what?

1853
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:11,369
Duck!

1854
01:26:15,374 --> 01:26:16,643
Good morning, brethren.

1855
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:18,177
Good morning, Father.

1856
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,780
Now, as you all know,

1857
01:26:19,813 --> 01:26:22,348
it's Baron von
Schmeichelhammer's funeral today.

1858
01:26:22,381 --> 01:26:25,752
And his widow is...

1859
01:26:25,786 --> 01:26:28,622
- a bit of a pious type.
- Ugh!

1860
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:30,189
So, I don't want to see anyone

1861
01:26:30,222 --> 01:26:32,258
eating chocolate
during the service.

1862
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:33,894
Yes, Father.

1863
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:35,429
We all know that one day,

1864
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,431
we shall be judged for our sins,

1865
01:26:37,464 --> 01:26:40,634
but it's not going to be today.

1866
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,436
Amen.

1867
01:26:56,382 --> 01:26:57,918
There, there.

1868
01:26:57,951 --> 01:27:00,319

1888

we did lose a giraffe.

I'm a sinner!

1893

A weak and wicked chocoholic!

1894
01:28:22,769 --> 01:28:24,604
Good morning, everyone.

1895
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:27,373
- Welcome to St. Benedict's.

1896
01:28:27,407 --> 01:28:31,011
Baroness, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

1897
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:35,615

down for a minute.

1900
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,955
Ah, the cavalry.

1901
01:28:41,988 --> 01:28:44,458
Are you the cleric who
called about a giraffe?

1902
01:28:50,697 --> 01:28:51,898
All clear.

1903
01:29:18,024 --> 01:29:20,527
Huh. "Thanks for
all your hard work."

1904
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,663
"Father Julius and
the Chocolate Cartel."

1905
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:25,264
Oh, that's nice.

1906
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:27,734
Mmm.

1907
01:29:27,768 --> 01:29:28,902
Here we are, Father.

1908
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:30,971
One giraffe.

1909
01:29:31,004 --> 01:29:32,839
- Marvelous.
- Thank you, thank you.

1910
01:29:32,873 --> 01:29:34,641

01:29:57,998 --> 01:29:59,032
Hello?

1919
01:29:59,065 --> 01:30:01,434
Basil? It's Gwennie.

1920
01:30:01,468 --> 01:30:02,502
You were right.

1921
01:30:02,536 --> 01:30:04,403
What are the chances?

1922
01:30:04,437 --> 01:30:07,674
Those days in chemistry class
were the happiest of my life.

1923
01:30:27,494 --> 01:30:29,062
Cool.

1924
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:37,571
Sorry about this, sir.

1925
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,439
The seafood truck
spilled its load.

1926
01:30:39,472 --> 01:30:41,575
There's so many blasted
flamingos about these days.

1927
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:43,710
Well, hurry it
along now, will you?

1928
01:30:43,743 --> 01:30:45,879
<i>The town square was
closed this morning</i>

1929
01:30:45,912 --> 01:30:48,849
<i>after a bizarre incident
at the city cathedral.</i>

1930
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:51,952
<i>Delaying the funeral of
noted philanthropist,</i>

1931
01:30:51,985 --> 01:30:54,120
<i>Baron von Schmeichelhammer.</i>

1932
01:30:54,154 --> 01:30:55,989
<i>In nomine Patris,</i>

1933
01:30:56,022 --> 01:30:59,426
<i>et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

1934
01:30:59,893 --> 01:31:01,628
Amen.

1935
01:31:05,966 --> 01:31:08,400
Sorry, I'd best get that.

1936
01:31:09,936 --> 01:31:11,605
- Hello, pulpit?
<i>- Father.</i>

1937
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:13,006
Everything all right there?

1938
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:14,474
<i>Oh, yes, Mr. Slugworth.</i>

1939
01:31:14,507 --> 01:31:16,476
All tickety-boo.

1940
01:31:16,509 --> 01:31:17,978
At least, it is now.

1941
01:31:18,011 --> 01:31:19,713
What do you mean by that?

1942
01:31:19,746 --> 01:31:21,581
<i>Oh, we had a giraffe
in here earlier.</i>

1943
01:31:21,615 --> 01:31:23,092
<i>Had to clear the whole
place for about 20 minutes,</i>

1944
01:31:23,116 --> 01:31:24,784
but everything's back to normal.

1945
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,622
Hello?

1946
01:31:28,655 --> 01:31:30,724
Damn the flamingos,
Donovan! Floor it!

1947
01:31:30,757 --> 01:31:32,158
Yes, sir!

1948
01:31:35,095 --> 01:31:36,830
Idiot!

1949
01:31:40,467 --> 01:31:42,102
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1950
01:31:42,135 --> 01:31:43,203
Well, keep looking.

1951
01:31:43,236 --> 01:31:44,738
It's not in here, Willy.

1952
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:46,673
But Abacus said
that it was here.

1953
01:31:46,706 --> 01:31:48,784
Abacus has been in the Wash
House for the past four years.

1954
01:31:48,808 --> 01:31:51,011
Maybe all the scrubbing
has gone to his head.

1955
01:31:51,044 --> 01:31:53,684
'Cause all that's down here is just
a bunch of stupid old chocolate.

1956
01:32:09,095 --> 01:32:10,430
Willy, look!

1957
01:32:18,605 --> 01:32:20,206
We did it, Noodle.

1958
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,975
We got 'em.

1959
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:26,212
Naughty, naughty, Mr. Wonka.

1960
01:32:26,246 --> 01:32:29,149
You've caused us quite
a bit of trouble.

1961
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:31,117
You and your urchin.

1962
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:32,852
Yeah, but she's
not just an urchin,

1963
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:33,954
is she, Mr. Slugworth?

1964
01:32:35,789 --> 01:32:37,023
You're family.

1965
01:32:37,857 --> 01:32:39,092
What?

1966
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:40,760
What are you talking
about, Willy?

1967
01:32:42,595 --> 01:32:44,564
You know that ring, Noodle?

1968
01:32:44,597 --> 01:32:46,566
The one your parents gave you?

1969
01:32:46,599 --> 01:32:48,735
Mr. Slugworth has
one just like it.

1970
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,037
Don't you, Mr. Slugworth?

1971
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:53,773
As a matter of fact, I do.

1972
01:32:53,807 --> 01:32:58,645
That belonged to my
brother. Zebedee.

1973
01:32:58,678 --> 01:33:00,046
Was he my father?

1974
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,882
A hopeless romantic
is what he was.

1975
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,251
Fell in love with a
common little bookworm,

1976
01:33:05,285 --> 01:33:07,554
died before they could marry.

1977
01:33:07,587 --> 01:33:11,057
Leaving me sole heir
to the family fortune.

1978
01:33:12,058 --> 01:33:14,661
Or so I thought.

1979
01:33:14,694 --> 01:33:16,663
<i>But nine months later,</i>

1980
01:33:16,696 --> 01:33:18,932
<i>your mother turned
up on my doorstep,</i>

1981
01:33:18,965 --> 01:33:22,035
<i>begging me to get a doctor
for her sick little newborn.</i>

1982
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:25,205
<i>I said I would help.</i>

1983
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:27,073
<i>But you didn't. Did you?</i>

1984
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:28,942
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1985
01:33:28,975 --> 01:33:30,977
<i>Instead, you put me
down a laundry chute.</i>

1986
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:32,912
Bye-bye, baby.

1987
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:34,981
<i>Mrs. Scrubitt found me.</i>

1988
01:33:35,015 --> 01:33:36,683
<i>She saw the ring.</i>

1989
01:33:36,716 --> 01:33:38,885
<i>Thought it was an "N,"
and called me Noodle.</i>

1990
01:33:39,819 --> 01:33:40,954
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

1991
01:33:40,987 --> 01:33:43,123
<i>It was "Z." For Zebedee.</i>

1992
01:33:43,156 --> 01:33:45,658
<i>Well, quite.</i>

1993
01:33:45,692 --> 01:33:47,737
<i>- When your mother returned, I told her you had died.</i>
- Oh, no!

1994
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:49,262
<i>She was heartbroken, of course.</i>

1995
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:51,031
<i>But, uh, I gave her a
handful of sovereigns</i>

1996
01:33:51,064 --> 01:33:53,099
<i>and had her escorted
from my property.</i>

1997
01:33:55,168 --> 01:33:56,703
What was her name?

1998
01:33:57,203 --> 01:33:58,705
Eh?

1999
01:33:58,738 --> 01:34:00,774
My mom. What was her name?

2000
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:03,576
Ooh.

2001
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:04,778
Let me see. Um...

2002
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:09,049
No, I don't think I
could remember that.

2003
01:34:09,082 --> 01:34:12,085
Sorry. But you
have to understand,

2004
01:34:12,118 --> 01:34:13,920
she was very poor.

2005
01:34:13,953 --> 01:34:16,122
Sorry, Felix.

2006
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:18,258
Her name was Dorothy.

2007
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:20,126
Dorothy Smith. It
says so right here.

2008
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:22,328
Dorothy?

2009
01:34:22,362 --> 01:34:24,064
Well, what do you know?

2010
01:34:24,097 --> 01:34:26,266
I guess you did teach
me to read after all.

2011
01:34:27,867 --> 01:34:29,169
Well, this is all very touching,

2012
01:34:29,202 --> 01:34:30,904
but back to business.

2013
01:34:30,937 --> 01:34:33,139
We'll take that, thank you.

2014
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:35,842
How much chocolate do you have at
your factory, Mr. Fickelgruber?

2015
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,977
Oh, about 80,000 gallons.

2016
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:40,013
Prodnose?

2017
01:34:40,046 --> 01:34:41,114
Seventy-five?

2018
01:34:41,147 --> 01:34:42,582
And I've got 150.

2019
01:34:43,417 --> 01:34:45,051
That should be enough.

2020
01:34:45,085 --> 01:34:46,085
For what?

2021
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,756
Death by chocolate.

2022
01:35:07,974 --> 01:35:09,175
On you go.

2023
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:28,962
Uh, gentlemen.

2024
01:35:30,363 --> 01:35:32,065
Considering the situation,

2025
01:35:32,098 --> 01:35:34,300
I wondered if you'd do a
good deed on my behalf.

2026
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:35,436
A what?

2027
01:35:35,469 --> 01:35:37,103
"A good deed."

2028
01:35:37,137 --> 01:35:39,072
It's a sort of pointless
act of selflessness...

2029
01:35:39,105 --> 01:35:41,442
Yes, of course, Mr. Wonka.

2030
01:35:41,475 --> 01:35:43,743
What would you like us to do?

2031
01:35:43,776 --> 01:35:45,736
I was wondering if you
could give this to someone.

2032
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:48,681
Only if you happen to see him.

2033
01:35:48,715 --> 01:35:49,816
And who is it?

2034
01:35:49,849 --> 01:35:52,152
- A little orange man.
- Eh?

2035
01:35:52,185 --> 01:35:53,786
A little orange man.

2036
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,054
About eight inches high,

2037
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:56,990
with orange skin and
bright green hair.

2038
01:35:57,023 --> 01:36:00,226
I owe him a jar of chocolates,
you see. And, well,

2039
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,962
I think these might be
the best I ever made.

2040
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:04,230
Well, in that case,

2041
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:06,232
I'll make sure he
gets them personally.

2042
01:36:11,204 --> 01:36:12,705
Farewell, Mr. Wonka.

2043
01:36:14,073 --> 01:36:15,073
Urchin.

2044
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:29,189
Willy...

2045
01:36:54,914 --> 01:36:56,950
What are we gonna do, Willy?

2046
01:36:56,983 --> 01:36:59,453
I don't know, Noodle.
I'll think of something.

2047
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:08,795
Best chocolate he ever made, eh?

2048
01:37:10,997 --> 01:37:12,865
- Whoo-hoo.
- Oh!

2049
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:15,835
I got it!

2050
01:37:15,868 --> 01:37:17,012
What is it? Did you
think of something?

2051
01:37:17,036 --> 01:37:18,404
Yes, I did.

2052
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:20,139
If we're gonna drown
in chocolate, Noodle,

2053
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:22,375
and let's face it, we're
gonna drown in chocolate,

2054
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:24,143
then it's gonna be
Wonka chocolate.

2055
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:27,113
We're not gonna drown,
Willy. Look, there's a light.

2056
01:37:27,146 --> 01:37:29,048
We'll let the
chocolate lift us up,

2057
01:37:29,082 --> 01:37:30,383
we'll bang on the glass,

2058
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:32,952
and pray somebody hears us.

2059
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:34,287
That's a much better idea.

2060
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,492
Ah, gentlemen.

2061
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:40,393
It was a bit of a close
shave this morning,

2062
01:37:40,427 --> 01:37:42,128
and I was wondering if perhaps

2063
01:37:42,161 --> 01:37:44,797
we could rethink our
arrangement. Or...

2064
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:51,137
Or... just leave
things as they are.

2065
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,171
Father.

2066
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,808
Well, Wonka might be as
nutty as a fruitcake,

2067
01:37:55,842 --> 01:37:57,377
but he sure knew how
to make chocolate.

2068
01:37:57,411 --> 01:37:59,078
- Mmm.
- But do you think

2069
01:37:59,112 --> 01:38:01,023
we should have saved some
for the Little Orange Man?

2070
01:38:01,047 --> 01:38:02,483
Tell me you're joking.

2071
01:38:02,516 --> 01:38:05,985
Uh, yes. Yes, I am.
Sorry, why am I?

2072
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:07,320
Because there's no such thing

2073
01:38:07,353 --> 01:38:09,523
as a little orange
man, ya nincompoop.

2074
01:38:12,925 --> 01:38:14,595
- Help!
- Help!

2075
01:38:14,628 --> 01:38:16,195
Somebody help, please!

2076
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:18,231
- Please help!
- Help!

2077
01:38:18,264 --> 01:38:20,567
Look. Look, somebody's
coming. Look.

2078
01:38:20,601 --> 01:38:22,268
Willy, we're saved!

2079
01:38:35,549 --> 01:38:37,917
- I'm sorry, Noodle.
- Don't be.

2080
01:38:38,918 --> 01:38:41,120
You found my family.

2081
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:43,089
A mom who loved me.

2082
01:38:44,057 --> 01:38:45,892
That's all I ever wanted.

2083
01:38:47,894 --> 01:38:49,062
Deep breath now.

2084
01:39:03,376 --> 01:39:07,146
Mmm! Exquisite.

2085
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:09,583
You mustn't let yourself
get so worked up.

2086
01:39:09,616 --> 01:39:12,085
It's just a bit of chocolate.

2087
01:39:12,118 --> 01:39:13,520
Correction.

2088
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:16,856
It was actually my chocolate.

2089
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:27,434
You have made a very
grave error, gentlemen.

2090
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:29,302
You steal from an Oompa Loompa,

2091
01:39:29,335 --> 01:39:30,403
we take back

2092
01:39:30,437 --> 01:39:31,638
a thousandfold.

2093
01:39:39,646 --> 01:39:41,080
What's going on, Willy?

2094
01:39:42,081 --> 01:39:44,050
It's draining, Noodle.

2095
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,052
We've been saved!

2096
01:39:46,085 --> 01:39:48,154
- By who?
- I don't know.

2097
01:39:49,523 --> 01:39:51,525
By the Little Orange Man!

2098
01:39:51,558 --> 01:39:52,593
- Look.
- Wh...

2099
01:39:52,626 --> 01:39:55,027
The Little Orange Man!

2100
01:39:55,061 --> 01:39:57,464
Thank you, Little
Orange Man! Thank you!

2101
01:40:20,621 --> 01:40:23,156
Gentlemen. Thank
goodness you're okay.

2102
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:24,491
I came as fast as I could.

2103
01:40:33,332 --> 01:40:35,201
Whew! Car shrunk.

2104
01:40:35,234 --> 01:40:36,570
I'm sure it did.

2105
01:40:36,603 --> 01:40:38,180
And you've nothing to
worry about, Chief.

2106
01:40:38,204 --> 01:40:39,606
All under control.

2107
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,983
A couple of thieves
broke in, but I'm afraid

2108
01:40:41,007 --> 01:40:44,043
they met with a
little... accident.

2109
01:40:44,076 --> 01:40:46,747
In which they died.

2110
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:50,049
That's actually
rather good, Gerald.

2111
01:40:50,082 --> 01:40:51,618
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

2112
01:40:51,652 --> 01:40:53,487
Officer, would you kindly
take a look at this?

2113
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,188
Wonka!

2114
01:40:55,221 --> 01:40:56,122
It details every
single illegal payment

2115
01:40:56,155 --> 01:40:58,024
these men have ever made.

2116
01:40:58,057 --> 01:40:59,560
Thousands of them.

2117
01:40:59,593 --> 01:41:02,161
Affable, don't listen
to her. She's lyin'.

2118
01:41:02,195 --> 01:41:03,730
Well, of course she is.

2119
01:41:03,764 --> 01:41:05,298
She's not, sir.

2120
01:41:05,331 --> 01:41:06,633
She's absolutely right.

2121
01:41:07,434 --> 01:41:08,435
It's incredible.

2122
01:41:09,302 --> 01:41:10,637
Oh. Well.

2123
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:12,606
Then that sounds like a case

2124
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:15,007
for the Chief of Police.

2125
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:17,152
So you give it to me, Affable, I'll,
uh... I'll take it off your hands.

2126
01:41:17,176 --> 01:41:18,455
You know, save
you the paperwork.

2127
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:20,213
I can't do that,
I'm afraid, sir.

2128
01:41:20,246 --> 01:41:21,582
Why's that?

2129
01:41:21,615 --> 01:41:23,484
Because your name is
written down here.

2130
01:41:23,517 --> 01:41:24,551
Huh?

2131
01:41:24,585 --> 01:41:26,520
- A lot.
- Gentlemen...

2132
01:41:26,553 --> 01:41:28,254
- You're under arrest.
- Run.

2133
01:41:28,287 --> 01:41:29,399
We puttin' handcuffs on, here?

2134
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:30,323
That's okay, Noodle.

2135
01:41:30,356 --> 01:41:32,091
Give it one second.

2136
01:41:34,293 --> 01:41:36,095
What's happening?

2137
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,498
Why are we airborne?

2138
01:41:37,531 --> 01:41:38,775
You didn't eat any
of those chocolates,

2139
01:41:38,799 --> 01:41:41,033
- did you, Mr. Slugworth?
- Why?

2140
01:41:41,067 --> 01:41:42,301
Because they're Hoverchocs.

2141
01:41:42,335 --> 01:41:45,204
Delayed action,
but extra strong.

2142
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:47,273
You think you're very
clever, don't you, Wonka?

2143
01:41:47,306 --> 01:41:50,243
Well, there's a billion sovereigns
of chocolate beneath our feet.

2144
01:41:50,276 --> 01:41:51,612
We'll get the best lawyers,

2145
01:41:51,645 --> 01:41:54,046
bribe the judge, rig
the jury if we have to.

2146
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,315
We'll be fine.

2147
01:41:56,349 --> 01:41:58,017
I wish I'd thought of that.

2148
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:02,421
Hey, Noodle!

2149
01:42:21,107 --> 01:42:22,409
What is that?

2150
01:42:22,442 --> 01:42:23,644
It's our chocolate!

2151
01:42:23,677 --> 01:42:25,378
All our chocolate!

2152
01:42:25,412 --> 01:42:26,613
We're ruined!

2153
01:42:26,647 --> 01:42:27,848
Hey, don't worry, gentlemen.

2154
01:42:27,881 --> 01:42:30,383
You'll come down eventually.

2155
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:33,386
Probably. I think.

2156
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,721
But until then,

2157
01:42:35,722 --> 01:42:38,592
ladies and gentlemen,

2158
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:42,261
Willy Wonka and friends...

2159
01:42:42,295 --> 01:42:45,732
invite you to enjoy
our chocolate.

2160
01:42:45,766 --> 01:42:47,834
Yay! Magic Wonka!

2161
01:42:51,337 --> 01:42:52,337
Gwennie?

2162
01:42:52,906 --> 01:42:54,541
Basil!

2163
01:42:55,809 --> 01:42:57,176
What did I say, Abacus,

2164
01:42:57,209 --> 01:42:58,512
I told you we could fix it all.

2165
01:43:16,563 --> 01:43:17,631
Your cup.

2166
01:43:18,498 --> 01:43:19,833
Thank you.

2167
01:43:19,866 --> 01:43:21,334
- There you are.
- There you go.

2168
01:43:21,367 --> 01:43:21,802
Careful, not too much.

2169
01:43:21,835 --> 01:43:22,835
Okay.

2170
01:45:01,468 --> 01:45:04,438
- Mmm.
- Oh, thank you.

2171
01:45:04,471 --> 01:45:06,238
Thank you.

2172
01:45:06,272 --> 01:45:08,442
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

2173
01:45:08,475 --> 01:45:09,943
- Mmm.
- Oh.

2174
01:45:19,052 --> 01:45:20,286
Huh.

2175
01:45:24,323 --> 01:45:27,326
So... how does it feel, Willy?

2176
01:45:28,394 --> 01:45:29,830
Is it as good as you remember?

2177
01:45:31,465 --> 01:45:32,899
Every little bit.

2178
01:45:36,603 --> 01:45:37,971
I wish it could last forever.

2179
01:45:44,544 --> 01:45:45,712
I guess it's time.

2180
01:45:47,814 --> 01:45:49,816
Time for what?

2181
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:52,318
Do you know how many people in
this city are named D. Smith?

2182
01:45:52,753 --> 01:45:55,387
106.

2183
01:45:55,422 --> 01:45:57,667
And luckily, you have a friend who
works at the telephone exchange.

2184
01:45:57,691 --> 01:45:59,693
And she spent the
entire afternoon

2185
01:45:59,726 --> 01:46:01,293
ringing around.

2186
01:46:01,327 --> 01:46:02,562
And guess what?

2187
01:46:04,064 --> 01:46:05,297
We found her.

2188
01:46:06,433 --> 01:46:07,968
You found my mom?

2189
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:09,636
She works in the library.

2190
01:46:11,104 --> 01:46:12,539
That's where she lives.

2191
01:46:14,674 --> 01:46:15,709

So goes a good deed

2211
01:47:58,545 --> 01:48:00,146
in a weary world.

2212
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:02,048
I was wondering if
I'd see you again.

2213
01:48:02,082 --> 01:48:04,084
I'm not going
anywhere, Willy Wonka.

2214
01:48:04,117 --> 01:48:05,785
Not until you've paid your debt.

2215
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:07,554
Now, I know you tried.

2216
01:48:07,587 --> 01:48:09,923
Loompa law is very
clear on this subject.

2217
01:48:09,956 --> 01:48:11,558
Until such time

2218
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:13,793
as the chocolate is
physically in my hand...

2219
01:48:15,662 --> 01:48:17,530
Oh. Thank you.

2220
01:48:17,564 --> 01:48:20,000
Thank you. For saving my life.

2221
01:48:21,668 --> 01:48:23,670
Well, I suppose that
concludes our business.

2222
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:26,806
I will now return to
my beloved Loompaland.

2223
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:30,911
Where the cocoa beans grow in
disappointingly small numbers,

2224
01:48:30,944 --> 01:48:32,746
and my friends look down on me.

2225
01:48:32,779 --> 01:48:35,048
What? I thought they
called you Lofty.

2226
01:48:35,081 --> 01:48:37,751
The truth is that
I am a quarter-inch

2227
01:48:37,784 --> 01:48:39,986
below average.

2228
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:41,721
They call me Shorty-pants.

2229
01:48:41,755 --> 01:48:43,690
But there it is.

2230
01:48:43,723 --> 01:48:45,158
Good day to you, sir.

2231
01:48:45,191 --> 01:48:46,726
Uh, it's a shame you have to go.

2232
01:48:47,694 --> 01:48:49,129
I said good day.

2233
01:48:49,162 --> 01:48:50,907
If I'm gonna share my
chocolate with the world,

2234
01:48:50,931 --> 01:48:52,141
I'm gonna need more than a shop.

2235
01:48:52,165 --> 01:48:53,233
I'm sure you will.

2236
01:48:53,266 --> 01:48:54,834
I'm gonna need a factory.

2237
01:48:54,868 --> 01:48:56,503
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

2238
01:48:56,536 --> 01:48:58,872
And someone to head up
the tasting department.

2239
01:48:58,905 --> 01:49:00,540
