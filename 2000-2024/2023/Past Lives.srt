1
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,830
<i>Who do you think
they are to each other?</i>

2
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,250
<i>Hm...</i>

3
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,290
<i>I don't know.</i>

4
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,250
<i>Yeah, this is a hard one.</i>

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
<i>I think</i>

6
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,890
<i>the white guy and the
Asian girl are a couple,</i>

7
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,060
<i>and the Asian guy
is her brother.</i>

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,350
<i>Or the Asian girl</i>

9
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,430
<i>and the Asian guy are a couple,</i>

10
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,360
<i>and the white guy is
their American friend.</i>

11
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,530
<i>They're not even
talking to the white guy.</i>

12
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,990
<i>Maybe they are tourists,</i>

13
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>and the white guy
is their tour guide.</i>

14
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,530
<i>Drinking at 4:00 a.m.?</i>

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>Yeah, you're right,
that makes no sense.</i>

16
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,620
<i>Hm. Maybe they're
all just colleagues?</i>

17
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,250
<i>I have no idea.</i>

18
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,110
Na Young.

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,660
Why are you crying?

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,440
Are you crying because you got
second-best marks in the exams?

21
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Are you mad at me because
I got first place?

22
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,390
Yes.

23
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,070
Hey! I'm always
second place to you,

24
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,400
but I never cry.

25
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,240
If I beat you for the first
time ever and you cry,

26
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,070
how do you think
that makes me feel?

27
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,120
You psycho.

28
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,730
Don't come in!

29
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,570
Talk from over there.

30
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,280
We decided.

31
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,990
What did you decide?

32
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,250
My name will be Michelle,
and Si Young's will be Mary.

33
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,620
I thought Si Young said that
she wants to be Michelle.

34
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,510
Why would you take
your sister's name?

35
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,510
I don't have an
English name I like.

36
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,350
Na Young, you still
shouldn't take Si Young's name.

37
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,970
But I hate all the names.

38
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,640
Let's
think more about it.

39
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,810
How's Leonore?

40
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,020
For short, Nora.

41
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,230
Nora.

42
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,730
Nora Moon.

43
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,490
Na Young.

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,160
Hm?

45
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Who do you
like at school nowadays?

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,686
What do you want to draw?

47
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,266
Ah,
I'm thinking two things.

48
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,090
I want you to draw a tree.

49
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,720
Tree? That's
what I'm good at.

50
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,890
A tree doesn't have feelers.

51
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,890
Hae Sung.

52
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Why?

53
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,150
He's manly.

54
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,860
He's manly?

55
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,240
Hm. Yeah. I will
probably marry him.

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,700
Really?

57
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,160
Does he want to marry you, too?

58
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,830
He likes me, so
he will if I tell him to.

59
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,370
Do you want to go
on a date with him?

60
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,860
They
look so good together.

61
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,480
Hae Sung talks about
Na Young a lot.

62
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,370
Na Young told me
that she likes him.

63
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,580
We're immigrating soon.

64
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,920
So I wanted to make
good memories for her.

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
You're immigrating?

66
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,680
Yes.

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,940
But why are you immigrating?

68
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,360
Na Young's dad is
a film director,

69
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,070
and you're an artist.

70
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,780
Why would you leave
all that behind?

71
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,500
If you leave something behind,
you gain something, too.

72
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,460
It all
looks the same to me.

73
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,610
- Black barks and white...
- What is it?

74
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,070
This is called "blue".

75
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,040
This is called "yellow".

76
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,820
You're really leaving?

77
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,900
Yeah.

78
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,400
You're never coming back?

79
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,570
No.

80
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,990
Why are you leaving?

81
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,280
Because I want to.

82
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,990
Why do you want to leave?

83
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,950
Because Koreans don't win the
Nobel Prize for Literature.

84
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,230
Bye!

85
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,440
Na Young, take care!

86
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,560
Bye.

87
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,660
Hey.

88
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,330
What?

89
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,750
Bye.

90
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,270
- <i>Hello.</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

91
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,520
<i>My name is
Nora, what's your name?</i>

92
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,400
My name is Michelle.

93
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,270
How are you, Michelle?

94
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm fine, and you?

95
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,040
I'm fine, and you?

96
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm fine, and you?

97
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm fine, and you?

98
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,756
I'm fine, and you?

99
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm fine, and you?

100
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,710
I'm fine, and you?

101
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,750
- I'm fine, and you?
- I'm fine, and you?

102
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,670
I'm...

103
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,670
{\an8}<i>Toronto Pearson
International Airport...</i>

104
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,116
{\an8}<i>Toronto Pearson
International Airport...</i>

105
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,246
{\an8}Na Young, Si Young!

106
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,100
{\an8}Let's go.

107
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,650
{\an8}Hurry up!

108
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,650
This is from Korea.

109
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,580
This is our passport, and...

110
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,730
Whoa!

111
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,740
I mean, there is so much in
it that... that I responded to.

112
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,210
But the one phrase that
sticks with me most...

113
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,910
- Mm-hmm.
- "The long journey of rotting."

114
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,460
I liked it, too.

115
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,380
We liked how you
used the long pauses.

116
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,550
Woah, Dong Yun...

117
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,880
He's a lawyer now.

118
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,300
<i>He was a really good kid.</i>

119
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,180
He helped me cover up
when I peed my pants in class.

120
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,180
<i>You'd pee
your pants all the time.</i>

121
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,940
A bedwetter
lives in New York City.

122
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,060
<i>Yeah.</i>

123
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,980
<i>This bedwetter is killing it.</i>

124
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,860
Who else should we look up?

125
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,080
- What's his name?
<i>- Hmm?</i>

126
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,660
The boy I had a
massive crush on?

127
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,580
I went on a date with him.

128
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,370
Hmm...

129
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,840
<i>- Uh... Jung Hae Sung.</i>
<i>- </i>Hae Sung.

130
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,480
Whoa! Mom, this is crazy.

131
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,150
He posted on Dad's movie's
Facebook page asking for me.

132
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,010
<i>What are
you talking about?</i>

133
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,370
He posted a few months ago.

134
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,120
"I am looking for Na Young...

135
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,870
I am her childhood friend.

136
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,040
I want to get in
touch with her."

137
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
<i>Wow. Really?</i>

138
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,250
Let me call you
back in a minute.

139
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,790
<i>Okay.</i>

140
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Um...

141
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,360
Oh, shit.

142
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,420
Hae
Sung! This is Na Young.

143
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,800
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

144
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,090
Listen...

145
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,560
This is a good thing...

146
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,710
It's a good thing!

147
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Think of it as a
blessing that you broke up,

148
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,880
and consider this
a new beginning.

149
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,570
There are
a lot of women in the world.

150
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,990
Don't worry!

151
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,200
Shit, I must be an idiot...

152
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,370
Why do I miss that bitch?

153
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,840
Of course you miss
her, you moron!

154
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,680
If you don't miss her

155
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,930
after being with
her for two years,

156
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,470
are you even human?

157
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,770
Hey, no problem. Cry hard.

158
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,060
Hey.

159
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,810
This is a good thing...

160
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,960
a good thing!

161
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,730
She didn't deserve
you. This is a good thing.

162
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,820
Hey!

163
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,530
Do you have a secret
girlfriend or something?

164
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,740
What are
you talking about?

165
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,040
Who's messaging
you at 3:00 a.m.?

166
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,380
I have no idea.

167
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,930
Huh?

168
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,860
Hae Sung, wake up!

169
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,470
Thank you for this meal.

170
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,820
Did you drink a lot last night?

171
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,530
Hmm.

172
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,070
Kind of.

173
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,790
Why are you in such a good mood?

174
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,030
<i>Woah.</i>

175
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,070
Woah.

176
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,080
<i>Woah.</i>

177
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,370
<i>It's you.</i>

178
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,370
Woah.

179
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,250
<i>I recognize you.</i>

180
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,170
You, too.

181
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,090
<i>I didn't even know
that you remembered me.</i>

182
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,680
<i>I just looked for
you as a joke...</i>

183
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,890
<i>then I saw that you'd
been looking for me.</i>

184
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,020
It
wasn't a joke for me.

185
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,020
I tried really hard to find you.

186
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,940
It looks like you
changed your name?

187
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,270
<i>Yeah. It's Nora now.</i>

188
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,610
That's why I couldn't find you.

189
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,040
Can I just call you Na Young?

190
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,280
<i>Of course.</i>

191
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,080
<i>But nowadays my mom doesn't
even call me Na Young.</i>

192
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh.

193
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,580
<i>It looked like
you're in New York.</i>

194
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,170
Yeah, I'm...

195
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,050
a writer here.

196
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,210
A playwright.

197
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,090
<i>Hmm.</i>

198
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,140
<i>Kinda like your father.</i>

199
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,550
Yeah.

200
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,850
<i>Hey, that's cool.</i>

201
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,810
Hmm, oh...

202
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,810
Hello?

203
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,350
<i>Hello?</i>

204
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,230
<i>Can you hear me? I'm here.</i>

205
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
Hmm.

206
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,900
Are you home?

207
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,740
<i>Yeah. I have to
go to class later.</i>

208
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,080
My mom says your
school is a good one.

209
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,790
<i>It's not bad.</i>

210
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,580
I guess you got good grades.

211
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,960
<i>I was ordinary.</i>

212
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,470
We used to compete
a lot in school.

213
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,350
You cried because
you lost to me.

214
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,020
<i>I lost once.</i>

215
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,140
Do you still cry a lot?

216
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,940
<i>No.</i>

217
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,900
Really?

218
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,730
You used to cry a lot
back in those days.

219
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,480
<i>Almost every day.</i>

220
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,320
<i>You would stay with me
whenever I was crying.</i>

221
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
Hmm.

222
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,410
Why don't you cry now?

223
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,490
You can't cry in New York City?

224
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,750
<i>Hmm...</i>

225
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,830
<i>When I first immigrated,</i>

226
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,510
<i>I used to cry a lot,</i>

227
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,220
<i>but then I realized
that nobody cared.</i>

228
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,850
I see.

229
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,680
<i>What do you study at school?</i>

230
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,320
Uh... Engineering.

231
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,690
<i>I know nothing about that.</i>

232
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,700
I like this.

233
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,460
<i>What?</i>

234
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,630
Just...

235
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,300
<i>talking to you.</i>

236
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>Yeah?</i>

237
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
<i>I'm a really fun
person to talk to.</i>

238
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,270
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

239
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,270
Yeah.

240
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,060
<i>Hmm.</i>

241
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,990
<i>I gotta go to class.</i>

242
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,110
Me, too. I have to eat dinner.

243
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,580
<i>You haven't eaten dinner yet?</i>

244
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Not yet.

245
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
<i>Hmm... What time is it there?</i>

246
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,170
Hmm. Midnight.

247
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,750
<i>And you still haven't eaten?</i>

248
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,210
No.

249
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,920
Go and eat right now.

250
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,930
<i>I will.</i>

251
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,270
What?

252
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,650
<i>It doesn't make sense but...</i>

253
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,610
<i>I'm not sure if I can
say something like this.</i>

254
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,030
What do you want to say?

255
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,710
<i>I missed you.</i>

256
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,100
<i>Me too.</i>

257
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,190
- Hmm.
<i>- It doesn't make any sense.</i>

258
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,910
<i>Umm, I really have to go now.</i>

259
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,400
<i>Class is starting soon.</i>

260
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,450
Okay. Bye.

261
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,080
Let's talk again.

262
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,830
<i>We should talk again.</i>

263
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,410
- <i>I'll send you an email.</i>
- Hmm.

264
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,670
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

265
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,290
<i>Hey.</i>

266
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,250
Hey.

267
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,790
Is it 7:00 in the morning there?

268
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,710
<i>I thought you said you
never wake up before 10:00.</i>

269
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,890
You said this is the only
time that works for you.

270
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,100
Don't you have class today?

271
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,350
<i>Yeah.</i>

272
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,690
<i>So I left home early.</i>

273
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,820
<i>How was rehearsal today?</i>

274
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,950
<i>Your Korean is rusty.</i>

275
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,000
Hey!

276
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,240
I only speak Korean
with you and my mom.

277
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,660
You said you're leaving
Korea to win the Nobel Prize.

278
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,670
You still want that?

279
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,590
<i>Hmm...</i>

280
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,760
<i>Nowadays,</i>

281
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,140
<i>I'm really interested
in the Pulitzer.</i>

282
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,850
<i>You're the same as the
12-year-old kid I remember.</i>

283
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,730
Greedy?

284
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,570
<i>Wants to do everything,
wants to have everything.</i>

285
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,240
Has a terrible temper.

286
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,950
<i>Exactly.</i>

287
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,460
<i>No, no, I'm kidding.</i>

288
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,210
So you're writing
there the whole month?

289
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,840
<i>Yeah.</i>

290
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,300
<i>It's an artist residency.</i>

291
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,630
<i>Can you see?</i>

292
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,550
<i>That's cool.</i>

293
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,260
<i>Where's Montauk?</i>

294
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,980
Hmm... From New York

295
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,940
about four hours east?

296
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,940
<i>Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.</i>

297
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,570
Have you seen it?

298
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,890
<i>What did I do?</i>

299
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,660
<i>I love you so much.</i>

300
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,240
<i>I'll do anything
to make you happy.</i>

301
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,200
<i>Tell me what you want
me to do and I'll do it.</i>

302
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,420
<i>Would
you ever come to New York?</i>

303
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,210
<i>Why would
I go to New York?</i>

304
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,920
Why are you going to China?

305
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,130
<i>To learn Mandarin.</i>

306
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,680
You should come to New York

307
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,720
<i>to learn English.</i>

308
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,690
I always wanted
to learn Mandarin.

309
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,980
It's also helpful for my work.

310
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
That's good.

311
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,820
<i>That's all I know.</i>

312
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,200
Hello?

313
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,540
Hello?

314
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,170
Hae Sung?

315
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,790
Na Young?

316
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,000
Can you hear me?

317
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,380
Hae Sung?

318
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,140
Can you hear me?

319
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,610
We're here.

320
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,700
You can see all of
Seoul from up here.

321
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,370
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

322
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,670
<i>Wish I were there.</i>

323
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,420
We should come here together.

324
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,140
I miss you.

325
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,060
Hello?

326
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,210
<i>Would you
ever come to Seoul?</i>

327
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,260
Why would I go to Seoul?

328
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,570
Have you done your homework?

329
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,860
I haven't.

330
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,570
You have to do it
for graduation.

331
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,860
I got under academic
probation last semester.

332
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,030
- Mm-hmm.
- Class captain's message.

333
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,530
Let me see your homework.

334
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,290
Maybe next time.

335
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,130
- I'm going.
- Oh. Huh?

336
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,120
Bye.

337
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,080
What's your plan
for the weekend?

338
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,420
Playing games.

339
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,130
<i>Hi.</i>

340
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,470
Hi.

341
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,970
<i>You're not asleep yet?</i>

342
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,600
Not yet.

343
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,070
You okay?

344
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,190
<i>Of course.</i>

345
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,780
What did you want to talk about?

346
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,330
When is it possible for you
to come visit me in New York?

347
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,710
<i>A year and a half or so,</i>

348
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,510
<i>because of my language
exchange program and...</i>

349
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,340
You don't have to
explain yourself.

350
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,020
It'll be at least a year before
I can come visit you in Seoul.

351
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,190
<i>I want us to stop
talking for a while.</i>

352
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,620
Why?

353
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,040
I immigrated twice to
be here in New York.

354
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,420
I want to accomplish
something here.

355
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,890
I want to commit
to my life here,

356
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,890
but I'm sitting around looking
up flights to Seoul instead.

357
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,810
So you want to
stop talking to me?

358
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,060
<i>Just for now.</i>

359
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,860
It took me 12 years
to find my friend.

360
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,740
<i>I'll be back before you know it.</i>

361
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,540
<i>We're just taking a brief break.</i>

362
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,510
I think it's a good idea.

363
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,720
Why am I like this?

364
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,690
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

365
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,740
What are you sorry about?

366
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,070
Were we dating or something?

367
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Okay.

368
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,840
Bye.

369
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,260
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

370
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,810
Okay.

371
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,230
Talk then.

372
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,510
Are you okay? We
walked around a lot.

373
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,470
My leg's a bit
hurt, but I'm okay.

374
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,640
- This leg hurt?
- It's okay.

375
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,770
- Rock, paper, scissor.
- No, thanks.

376
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,220
Hae Sung, you're late.

377
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,590
We're here because of you.

378
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,920
You all packed?

379
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,090
Almost.

380
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,140
So when are you flying out?

381
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,180
This Sunday.

382
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,850
So you'll be there all summer?

383
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,110
Hey, tonight we
drink 'til we die.

384
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,980
Why is he like this?

385
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,950
Hell yeah!

386
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,030
If Hae Sung says
we drink, we drink.

387
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,450
Another soju, please!

388
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,880
Hi.

389
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,550
Hi! I'm Nora.

390
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,390
I'm Arthur. Nice to meet you.

391
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,930
When'd you get in?

392
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,270
This morning.

393
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,650
- You got the worst room.
- Right?

394
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,480
I know.

395
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,080
<i>There
is a word in Korean.</i>

396
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,010
In-Yun.

397
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,970
<i>It means "providence".</i>

398
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,430
<i>Or... "fate".</i>

399
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,730
<i>But it's specifically</i>

400
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,230
<i>about relationships
between people.</i>

401
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,610
<i>I think it comes from Buddhism</i>

402
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,570
<i>and reincarnation.</i>

403
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,860
<i>It's an</i> In-Yun

404
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,910
<i>if two strangers even walk
by each other in the street</i>

405
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,790
<i>and their clothes
accidentally brush.</i>

406
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,870
<i>Because</i>

407
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,670
<i>it means there must have
been something between them</i>

408
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,500
<i>in their past lives.</i>

409
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,930
<i>If two people get married,</i>

410
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,770
<i>they say it's because there
have been 8,000 layers</i>

411
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,020
<i>of</i> In-Yun.

412
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,530
<i>Over 8,000 lifetimes.</i>

413
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,080
You believe in that?

414
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Believe what?

415
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
That...

416
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,130
you and I knew each
other in another life.

417
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,640
What, because we
are sitting here...

418
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,110
at the same table

419
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,570
in the same city

420
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,360
- in the same time?
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,270
Yeah, wouldn't that make this

422
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,610
an <i>In-Yun?</i>

423
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,570
Mm...

424
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,660
- Mm-mm.
- Mm.

425
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,420
That's just
something Koreans say

426
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,950
to seduce someone.

427
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

428
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,510
Where you going?

429
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,950
New York City.

430
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,716
Why're you going there?

431
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,740
We live there.

432
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,046
What's your occupation?

433
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,040
Writers.

434
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,520
You're what?

435
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,750
We're writers.

436
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,670
How long were you
visiting Toronto?

437
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,000
Ten days.

438
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,950
What was the purpose
of your visit?

439
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,420
We were visiting her family.

440
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,340
Are you two related?

441
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,680
We're married.

442
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,110
Thanks!

443
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,430
Hey.

444
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,526
<i>"If you bought a
ticket to see this show,</i>

445
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,300
<i>"took the subway or
a cab to be here,</i>

446
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,560
"it cost you
something to be here,

447
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,940
"and spend a couple hours
with these old women,

448
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,560
"that makes you some
kind of immigrant.

449
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,400
"And all this cost
me something, too.

450
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,410
"I crossed the Pacific
Ocean to be here.

451
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,660
"Some crossings cost
more than others.

452
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,750
"Some crossings you pay
for with your whole life."

453
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,016
Sit most of the day,

454
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,260
and in the end I...

455
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,340
And then I started
to write about...

456
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,880
<i>After Dinner.</i>

457
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,090
Um, yeah, I mean,
it's my kind of time.

458
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,970
Uh, but you're studying, right?

459
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,230
I'm hungry.

460
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,610
Me, too.

461
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,150
What do you want to eat?

462
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,430
I don't know.

463
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,660
Ah...
What can I do?

464
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,430
- You know what I want?
- What?

465
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,970
Chicken wings.

466
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,270
Holy shit.

467
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,060
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

468
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,070
Oh, genius.

469
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,560
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

470
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,440
Chicken wings!

471
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,820
Mm...

472
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:59,870
What're you thinking about?

473
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,080
Remember I told
you about Hae Sung?

474
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,250
Oh, yeah.

475
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,000
Is that this week?

476
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,670
Yeah.

477
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,420
Why is he coming here again?

478
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,590
I think vacation.

479
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,890
Why are
you going to New York?

480
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
Vacation.

481
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,480
Rest, enjoy, have fun.

482
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,520
You're not going there
to see that girl, right?

483
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Who?

484
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,170
Why are you pretending
not to know who I'm talking about?

485
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,160
Your first love. I
thought she lives there.

486
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,730
You gonna see her now that you
broke up with your girlfriend?

487
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,580
You think I'm nuts?
She's married.

488
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,250
Really?

489
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,540
Hmm.

490
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,130
I think it's been
about seven years.

491
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,010
She married early.

492
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,930
Ah,
you poor bastard.

493
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,930
What?

494
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,940
It's going to rain the
whole time you're there.

495
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,250
Look.
"Severe thunderstorm".

496
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,280
Hey, don't forget
your rain boots and raincoat.

497
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,320
It really does say
"severe thunderstorm."

498
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,470
Uh, trunk? Trunk?

499
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,150
Hae Sung!

500
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,810
Woah. It's you.

501
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,480
Ah, what can I do?

502
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,790
What should I say?

503
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,090
I don't know.

504
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,470
Was the last time we
talked twelve years ago?

505
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,200
Glad the weather is nice today.

506
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,200
You're right.

507
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,550
Should we go?

508
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,260
Yes.

509
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,560
Before I got married,

510
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,890
I went to Korea with my husband.

511
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,480
I know.

512
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,570
I emailed you,

513
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,030
but you didn't respond.

514
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,370
I wanted to see you.

515
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,040
I was disappointed.

516
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,340
I'm sorry.

517
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,760
I wanted to meet
your girlfriend, too.

518
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,260
How are you two doing?

519
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,810
We're not
together right now.

520
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,360
You broke up?

521
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,280
No.

522
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,240
It's not that.

523
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,280
We just need time to think.

524
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,500
We just started talking
about getting married.

525
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,840
Do you not
want to get married?

526
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,550
I don't know.

527
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,800
If you love her,
why don't you know?

528
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,640
It's a little complicated.

529
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,180
What's complicated?

530
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,640
The conditions are not met.

531
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,310
What do you mean?

532
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,530
I'm an only child.

533
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,490
If you're going to
marry an only son,

534
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,320
he should make more
money and be better.

535
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,990
I'm too ordinary.

536
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,070
You're ordinary?

537
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,700
My job is ordinary,
my income is ordinary.

538
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,160
It's all ordinary.

539
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,790
She should meet someone
more impressive than me.

540
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,220
Is it hard to get married if
you don't make a ton of money?

541
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,640
At first we didn't think so,

542
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,520
but then we started
thinking that way.

543
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,320
Want me to take a photo of you?

544
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,110
Okay.

545
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,630
You look good.

546
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,770
Would you and your husband
come out here often on dates?

547
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,520
Hmm.

548
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:35,070
We lived near here before we
moved to the East Village.

549
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,690
We did all our dating here.

550
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,200
We would fight here, too.

551
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,830
- You two fight?
- Oh yeah, we don't fuck around.

552
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,330
Why do you fight?

553
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,700
Just because.

554
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:54,040
It's like planting
two trees in one pot.

555
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,710
Our roots need to
find their place.

556
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,260
Does your husband get
along with your family?

557
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:10,810
Yeah. He plays <i>Hwa-Too</i>
with them all the time.

558
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,600
He plays <i>Hwa-Too?</i>

559
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,980
Of course.

560
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,110
He knows how?

561
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,980
He's good.

562
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,940
Is his Korean good, too?

563
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,450
No.

564
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,660
But he can say a few things.

565
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,160
Oh, yeah?

566
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,950
His favorite food
is <i>Yook-Gae-Jang.</i>

567
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,380
<i>Yook-Gae-Jung?</i> He's
not fucking around.

568
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,630
He's not fucking around.

569
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,420
Do you and your girlfriend...

570
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,970
fight?

571
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,300
No.

572
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,020
She's not really my
girlfriend right now.

573
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,560
You should get married well.

574
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,270
You're worrying about me?

575
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:05,740
Getting married is hard for
idealistic people like you.

576
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:10,410
Hey, I'm not so
old that you should worry.

577
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,950
Hae Sung.

578
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,870
Hmm?

579
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,580
Why did you look for me?

580
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,130
- 12 years ago?
- Hmm.

581
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,300
Do you really want to know?

582
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,600
I just wanted to see
you one more time.

583
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,850
I don't know.

584
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,320
Because you just
left so suddenly...

585
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,450
I was a little pissed off.

586
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,410
Sorry.

587
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,450
What are you sorry about?

588
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,330
You're right. There's
nothing to be sorry about.

589
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,550
You disappeared from my
life, and I just bam...

590
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,840
found you again.

591
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:49,380
Why would you do that?

592
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,310
I don't know.

593
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,060
Just because...

594
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,940
You kept entering my mind
when I was in the military.

595
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,950
I see.

596
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,710
We were babies then.

597
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,340
Right.

598
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,510
And when we met 12 years ago,

599
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,550
we were babies then, too.

600
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
We're not babies anymore.

601
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,190
- Hi.
- Hi, my love.

602
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,900
How was it?

603
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,160
You were right.

604
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,530
I was?

605
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:38,950
Yeah.

606
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,370
He came here to see me.

607
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:32,090
It's so crazy to see
him be this grown-up man

608
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:36,390
with a normal job
and a normal life.

609
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,640
He's so Korean.

610
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,440
He still lives with his parents,

611
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,270
which is really Korean.

612
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,940
And he has all these
really Korean views

613
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,400
about everything.

614
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,480
And I feel so not Korean
when I'm with him.

615
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,400
But also,

616
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,200
in some way, more Korean?

617
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,160
It's so weird.

618
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,290
I mean, I have Korean friends,

619
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:07,300
but he's not, like,
Korean-American.

620
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,670
He's Korean-Korean.

621
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,800
Is he attractive?

622
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,630
I think so.

623
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,850
He's really
masculine in this way

624
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,640
that I think is so Korean.

625
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,230
Are you attracted to him?

626
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,190
I don't think so.

627
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:34,910
I don't know, I mean...

628
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,400
I don't think so.

629
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,210
He was just this kid in my head

630
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:47,870
for such a long time,

631
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:52,170
and then he was just
this image on my laptop,

632
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:55,880
and now he's a physical person.

633
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,260
It's really intense,

634
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,430
but I don't think that
that's attraction.

635
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,430
I think I just missed him a lot.

636
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,760
I think I missed Seoul.

637
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,310
Did he miss you?

638
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,730
I think he missed the
12-year-old crybaby

639
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,650
he knew a long time ago.

640
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,150
You were a crybaby?

641
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:17,820
Yeah.

642
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,280
Most of the time he'd have to
just stand there and watch me.

643
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,750
When is he leaving again?

644
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,510
Morning after tomorrow.

645
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:36,630
Mm-hmm.

646
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,410
Are you mad?

647
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,120
No.

648
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,420
It feels like you are.

649
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,330
I don't have
a right to be mad.

650
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,670
What do you mean?
Of course, you do.

651
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:14,760
No...

652
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,550
That guy flew 13
hours to be here.

653
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,630
I'm not gonna tell you

654
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,300
that you can't see
him or something.

655
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,550
He's your childhood sweetheart.

656
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,010
And it's not like you're
gonna run away with him.

657
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,890
Are you?

658
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,690
Definitely. I'm gonna
throw away my life here...

659
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:36,810
and run away with him to Seoul.

660
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,940
Do you even know me?

661
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,780
I'm not gonna miss my
rehearsals for some dude.

662
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:47,830
I know.

663
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,040
I know you.

664
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,720
What?

665
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,100
I was just thinking about
what a good story this is.

666
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,980
- The story of Hae Sung and me?
- Yeah.

667
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,020
I just can't compete.

668
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,230
What do you mean?

669
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:10,370
Childhood sweethearts
who reconnect 20 years later

670
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,700
only to realize they were
meant for each other.

671
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:15,250
- We're not meant for each other.
- I know.

672
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,130
I know. In the story, I would be
the evil white American husband

673
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,500
standing in the way of destiny.

674
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,760
Shut up.

675
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,800
What do you not like about it?
Our story's just so boring.

676
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,020
We met at an artists' residency.

677
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,480
Slept together because we
both happened to be single.

678
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,996
We realized we both
live in New York,

679
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,030
so, we moved in together
to save money on rent.

680
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,830
We got married so you could
get a green card. So...

681
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:49,910
Oh, you make it
sound so romantic.

682
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,310
Right, that's what I'm saying.

683
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,130
I'm the guy you
leave in the story

684
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:59,000
when your ex-lover
comes to take you away.

685
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,830
He's not my ex-lover.

686
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,470
What if you met somebody else

687
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,180
at that residency?

688
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,810
What if there was another
writer from New York

689
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,520
who had also read all
the same books you had,

690
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,600
and watched all the same movies,

691
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,060
who could give you useful
notes on your plays,

692
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,860
and listen to you complain
about your rehearsals?

693
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,450
- That's not how life works.
- Oh.

694
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,070
Yeah.

695
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:35,450
But wouldn't you be
laying here with him?

696
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,670
This is my life, and
I'm living it with you.

697
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,710
Are you happy with it?

698
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,890
Is this what you
imagined for yourself

699
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:50,220
when you left Seoul?

700
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,840
When I was a 12-year-old?

701
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,430
Yeah. Is this what you
pictured for yourself?

702
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:57,810
Lying in bed in some

703
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,190
tiny apartment in
the East Village

704
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,610
with some Jewish guy
who writes books?

705
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,110
Is that what your
parents wanted for you?

706
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,950
You're asking me if
you, Arthur Zaturansky,

707
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,700
are the answer to my
family's immigrant dream?

708
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,830
- Yeah.
- Wow.

709
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,450
I know.

710
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,710
This is where we ended up.

711
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,880
This is where I'm
supposed to be.

712
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,220
Okay.

713
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,520
What?

714
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:48,730
It's just that you make
my life so much bigger.

715
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,450
And I'm wondering if I do
the same thing for you.

716
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,240
You do.

717
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,800
I'm just a girl from
Korea, you know?

718
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,060
And you're forgetting the
part where I love you.

719
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,640
I don't forget that.

720
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,600
I have trouble
believing it sometimes.

721
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,840
Do you know you
only speak in Korean

722
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,880
when you talk in your sleep?

723
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,430
- I do?
- Yeah.

724
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,890
You never sleep talk in English.

725
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,560
You only dream in Korean.

726
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,490
I didn't know that.

727
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:11,780
Yeah.

728
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,280
You never told me that.

729
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,610
Well, sometimes I
think it's cute.

730
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,410
Sometimes, I don't know,

731
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,540
I guess I get scared.

732
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,330
Scared of what?

733
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,260
You dream in a language
that I can't understand.

734
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:39,510
It's like there's
this whole place

735
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,350
inside of you where I can't go.

736
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,400
I think that's why I've
been trying to learn Korean,

737
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,650
even though I know
it's annoying for you.

738
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:01,290
You want to understand
me when I'm dreaming?

739
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,620
Yeah.

740
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,790
I'm sure I'm just
saying gibberish.

741
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:42,950
- Hey.
- Hey.

742
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,370
Did you get home
safe last night?

743
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:46,620
Yeah.

744
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,170
Sorry I'm late.

745
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,000
Did you eat something?

746
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,630
No.

747
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,050
Eat this.

748
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,930
Is it for me?

749
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,400
I wanted to ask you yesterday...

750
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:20,990
What prize do you
want to win nowadays?

751
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,320
Hmm?

752
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:27,040
When you were little, you
wanted to win the Nobel Prize,

753
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,750
and 12 years ago you
wanted to win the Pulitzer.

754
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,290
What do you want to win now?

755
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,930
I haven't thought of
things like that recently.

756
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:39,130
Really?

757
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,840
Then think about
it for a moment.

758
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,550
There must be an award you want.

759
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,690
A Tony.

760
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,860
You really are exactly the
same as I remember you.

761
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,150
Still psycho?

762
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,400
Still psycho.

763
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,490
A little bit to your left.

764
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,910
One, two... three!

765
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:55,750
One more.

766
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,590
Why are you taking
it so close up?

767
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,540
Fine. Go back a little bit.

768
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,860
She's
turned against us.

769
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,020
Hold on.

770
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,320
You look young.

771
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,200
Because of my green card,

772
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,660
we got married a little
earlier than planned.

773
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,630
He knows I'm coming over?

774
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Of course.

775
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:33,350
He knows who I am?

776
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,180
Of course!

777
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:37,850
He wants to meet you.

778
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,130
Come in.

779
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,200
Um...

780
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,950
Hello.

781
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,830
Nice to meet you.

782
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:49,010
Uh, hi.
Nice to meet you, also.

783
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,390
His Korean is good.

784
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:53,680
No.

785
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,520
Uh...

786
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,940
Are you hungry?

787
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:05,010
Are you hungry?

788
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,730
- Hmm?
- Oh...

789
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,480
Hungry?

790
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,030
Ah, oh. Yes.

791
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:13,400
What
would you like to eat?

792
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,950
Uh...

793
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,660
Pasta?

794
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,250
Pasta? Yeah.

795
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,460
You like pasta?

796
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,790
Yes.

797
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

798
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:26,670
- Let's get pasta.
- Pasta.

799
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,880
What did you two do today?

800
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,510
Uh...

801
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,350
The Statue of Liberty.

802
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:43,520
You took the ferry.

803
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,940
- Yes.
- Yeah.

804
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,810
It's, um, nice.

805
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,490
I've never been.

806
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:49,740
- What?
- Really?

807
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:52,320
Yeah, I've never
actually been there.

808
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,200
Hey, you
should take your husband.

809
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,086
Have we seriously
never been there together?

810
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:01,580
No.

811
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,760
<i>When I was 24 years,</i>

812
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,390
I, uh... Um...

813
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,770
Oh.
Military service?

814
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:25,400
Yes.

815
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,400
Oh,
military service.

816
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,610
Right.

817
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:30,916
You know how Korean men have
mandatory military service?

818
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:33,360
Yeah, your dad talks
about it. How was it?

819
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,490
You like it?

820
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,530
How was
it? Did you like it?

821
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:39,580
No.

822
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:44,540
Uh, but military and work, same.

823
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,290
Same?

824
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:47,880
Same? How?

825
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,750
Uh, you have, um...

826
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,630
You have a boss.

827
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:53,760
Hmm.

828
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,300
There's
overtime pay,

829
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,476
stuff like that here, right?

830
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,360
In Korea, you work
overtime all the time,

831
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,010
but there's no overtime pay.

832
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,350
There's no
overtime pay in Korea.

833
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:06,850
- Really?
- Mm.

834
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,980
You have to do
all of your boss's work first,

835
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:13,020
then you do your own work,

836
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,740
and then you can go home.

837
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,950
Late at night?

838
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,580
That's so hard.

839
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,290
It's, uh, very hard.

840
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:28,500
Hmm. Uh, work. Work is hard.

841
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,550
Hard physically or mentally?

842
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,470
Physically,
or mentally?

843
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:36,720
Uh, yes. Uh, both.

844
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,880
Physical, very hard.

845
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:44,050
- Uh, and, um...
- Hmm. Mentally.

846
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,480
Uh, mentally, I'm strong.

847
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,310
Mm!

848
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,980
You're
strong mentally?

849
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,610
Yes, right.

850
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,370
It was good that you immigrated.

851
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:14,420
Mm. I agree.

852
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,460
Korea is too small
of a country for you.

853
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:20,220
It's not enough to
satisfy your ambition.

854
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,760
I'm glad to have seen you.

855
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,100
Yeah.

856
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,480
And thank you for introducing
me to your husband.

857
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,770
I can tell he really loves you.

858
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,440
Hmm.

859
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,160
I didn't know that liking your
husband would hurt this much.

860
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,040
Yeah?

861
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,380
Hmm.

862
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:06,850
When we stopped talking,

863
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:09,310
I really missed you.

864
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,900
Did you miss me?

865
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,020
Of course.

866
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,600
But you met your husband then.

867
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,400
You got a girlfriend then, too.

868
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:24,490
Sorry.

869
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:30,950
It's okay.

870
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,160
Seeing you again

871
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,590
and being here

872
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,710
makes me have a lot
of weird thoughts.

873
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,380
What kind of thoughts?

874
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:47,600
What if I'd come
to New York 12 years ago?

875
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,270
What if you had
never left Seoul?

876
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,730
If you hadn't just
left like that,

877
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:56,400
and we just grew up together,

878
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,070
would I still have
looked for you?

879
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,360
Would we have dated? Broken up?

880
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,160
Gotten married?

881
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,750
Would we have had kids together?

882
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,200
Thoughts like that.

883
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,130
But the truth I learned here is,

884
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,090
you had to leave
because you're you.

885
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:34,140
And the reason I liked
you is because you're you.

886
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:41,650
And who you are is
someone who leaves.

887
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:47,450
The Na
Young you remember

888
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,320
doesn't exist here.

889
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,780
I know.

890
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,160
But...

891
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,790
that little girl did exist.

892
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,840
She's not sitting
here in front of you,

893
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,010
but it doesn't mean
she's not real.

894
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:10,890
20 years ago,

895
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:15,100
I left her behind with you.

896
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,190
I know.

897
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,940
And even though I was only 12,

898
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,150
I loved her.

899
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,910
You psycho.

900
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:45,670
I think there was something
in our past lives.

901
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,930
Otherwise, why would we be
here together right now?

902
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,440
But in this life,

903
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,440
we don't have the <i>In-Yun</i> to be

904
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,310
that kind of person
to each other.

905
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,270
Because now, finally,

906
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,940
we're in the same city

907
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,650
for the first time
in 20 years...

908
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,240
We're sitting here
with your husband.

909
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,880
In this life, you and Arthur are
that kind of <i>In-Yun</i> to each other.

910
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,550
You two have the 8,000
layers of <i>In-Yun.</i>

911
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:34,180
To Arthur,

912
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,390
you're someone who stays.

913
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:43,690
He's
talking about you.

914
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,086
Who do you think

915
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:52,586
we were to each other
in our past lives?

916
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:53,850
I don't know.

917
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,870
Maybe... an impossible affair?

918
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,000
Between the queen and
the king's henchman?

919
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:03,630
Or maybe we were
forced to live together

920
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,510
in a political marriage,

921
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:07,510
and we were awful to each other.

922
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,930
Cheat on each other a bunch.

923
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:10,590
Say hurtful things
to each other.

924
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:14,276
Or maybe we were just
sitting next to each other

925
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,310
on the same train.

926
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:16,640
Why?

927
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,730
Just because that's
what our tickets said.

928
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,270
Maybe,

929
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:26,440
we were just a bird

930
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,690
and the branch it
sat on one morning.

931
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:16,450
I'm
sorry we speak alone.

932
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:19,240
Uh, we will stop.

933
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,380
It's okay.

934
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:31,250
You haven't seen each
other in a long time.

935
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:42,600
I never thought I'd be a
part of something like this.

936
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,270
Hmm?

937
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,600
Sitting here with you.

938
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:55,150
Do you know what <i>In-Yun?</i>

939
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:59,280
Yeah. Nora told me about
it when we first met.

940
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,660
You and me.

941
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:07,880
Yeah. Yeah, you and I

942
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,790
are <i>In-Yun</i> too.

943
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:11,290
Right?

944
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:20,800
I'm really glad you came here.

945
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,100
It was the right thing to do.

946
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:51,040
Mm. I'm gonna walk
him to his Uber.

947
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,880
Okay.

948
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:58,300
Uh, nice to meet you.

949
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,220
Nice to meet you, too.

950
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:03,720
Uh, come visit me in Korea.

951
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,100
Definitely.

952
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:15,390
I'll be right back.

953
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,440
Okay.

954
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,110
Will
it be here soon?

955
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:46,780
Hmm.

956
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,370
Two minutes.

957
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,960
Hey!

958
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:32,050
Na Young.

959
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:34,760
Hmm?

960
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:47,610
What if this is a
past life as well,

961
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:51,110
and we are already

962
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,740
something else to each
other in our next life?

963
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:03,040
Who do you think we are then?

964
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,130
I don't know.

965
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:13,930
Me neither.

966
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,940
See you then.

967
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:57,950
I'm sorry!

968
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:10,270
<i>Building statues In the park</i>

969
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:17,230
<i>Mosaic faces Fading in the rain</i>

970
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:22,450
<i>Recalling memories of love</i>

971
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:29,330
<i>We're untouched And unscathed</i>

972
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:38,470
<i>Is this really A mystery life?</i>

973
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:45,300
<i>We all learn from
Our own mistakes</i>

974
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:51,270
<i>We stare, fall down stairs</i>

975
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:56,860
<i>Maybe you're Too much for me</i>

976
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:02,990
<i>We cry out</i>

977
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:07,530
<i>Break my heart, now</i>

978
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:15,130
<i>You called it out
You called it out</i>

979
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,920
<i>To stay here</i>

980
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:26,180
<i>A long car drive</i>

981
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:32,690
<i>Music in my head</i>

982
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:38,810
<i>Come from a place</i>

983
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:45,240
<i>I don't know where</i>

984
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:53,370
<i>Swear that stars
Are aligning but</i>

985
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:59,510
<i>On a faraway stair
On a torched midnight</i>

986
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:05,800
<i>A field of death On
those marble steps</i>

987
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,510
<i>We'll meet again in life</i>

988
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:13,770
<i>That's how it's done</i>

989
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,600
<i>That's how it's done</i>

990
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,770
<i>And I would soon burn</i>

991
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:29,570
<i>That's how it starts
That's how it starts</i>

992
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:34,200
<i>And I will soon know</i>

993
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:40,420
<i>Fall, fall</i>

994
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:47,420
<i>Falling down In spite of it all</i>

995
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:52,930
<i>Fall, fall</i>

996
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:58,350
<i>Will we meet Again and again?</i>

997
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:04,650
<i>Ooh</i>

998
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:10,780
<i>Ooh</i>
