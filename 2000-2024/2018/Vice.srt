1
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,585
The following is a true story.

2
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,610
Or as true as it can be
given that Dick Cheney

3
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:43,367
is one of the most
secretive leaders in history

4
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:47,451
But we did our fucking best.

5
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,133
How you doing tonight?

6
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:40,637
I need you to get
out of the car.

7
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:46,374
C'mon, let's get out.

8
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:09,438
Move, get cleared!

9
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,688
Move, clear.

10
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:15,219
- Move, move, move.
- Clear.

11
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,626
A plane just struck
The Pentagon.

12
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,149
Let's make sure
those phone lines

13
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,698
- are working.
- Phone's are a go sir.

14
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:38,175
SIVITS. Let's contact the FAA. Find
out how many planes are in the air.

15
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,932
- Yes.
- Let's get these televisions working.

16
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,308
May I get the President
on the line, please?

17
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:44,172
That's right. We've got planes in
the air nowhere for them to land.

18
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,288
I need permission for them to
land at the Canadian airport.

19
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,441
If I go to Pennsylvania on course,

20
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,609
and three other planes
are unaccounted for.

21
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,796
I am seeing five planes unaccounted for.

22
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,840
No, no. Scratch that,
I am seeing four.

23
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:01,888
I have got three in
international air.

24
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,569
I have NOID on the line.

25
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:06,019
That is correct, he
has, that is correct.

26
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:09,387
Mr. Vice President,
POTUS, line 1 sir.

27
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,976
Mr. President.

28
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,749
This situation is
extremely fluidic.

29
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,442
Strongly recommending
you stay in the air.

30
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,436
I've sequestered
Congressional leadership.

31
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,324
Okay then.

32
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,623
Sir, Don Rumsfeld is at
The Pentagon, on line 3.

33
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,062
- That?
- Uh huh.

34
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,233
Yes sir.

35
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,655
Dick, are there still passenger planes
in the air? I need rules of engagement.

36
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,926
Let's get to President back on line sir.

37
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:47,915
You have authorization to shoot
down any aircraft deemed a threat.

38
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,928
- Presidential authority?
- That is correct.

39
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,521
- All orders are UNODIR.
- UNODIR sir?

40
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,823
Unless otherwise directed.

41
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:03,630
By all accounts of what
people saw in that room

42
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:05,970
on that terrible day,

43
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,443
there was confusion,

44
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,822
fear,

45
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,228
uncertainty,

46
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:19,654
but Dick Cheney saw something
else that no one else did...

47
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,888
he saw an opportunity.

48
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:31,604
As the world becomes
more and more confusing,

49
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:36,395
we tend to focus on the things that
are right there in front of us.

50
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:42,826
While ignoring the massive
forces that actually change

51
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,807
and shape our lives.

52
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,811
With people working longer and
longer hours,

53
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,574
for less and less.

54
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,309
When we do have free time,

55
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:59,150
the last thing we want is complicated
analysis of our government,

56
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:04,894
lobbying, international trade
agreements, and tax bills.

57
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:09,896
So it's no surprise that

58
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,511
when a monotone bureaucratic
Vice President came to power

59
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:17,738
we hardly noticed.

60
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,317
As he achieved

61
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,922
a position of authority
that very few leaders

62
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:27,299
in the history of
America ever have.

63
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:38,188
Forever changing the
course of history

64
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,208
for millions and
millions of lives.

65
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:46,089
And he did it like a ghost.

66
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:49,905
With most people having
no idea who he is

67
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,300
or where he came from.

68
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:14,722
How does a man...
go on to become...

69
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,172
who he is.

70
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,141
Well...

71
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,266
it starts in 1963.

72
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:27,478
Dick's best girl Lynne was getting
straight A's at Colorado College.

73
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,956
Lynne had helped Dick get
a scholarship at Yale,

74
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:42,111
where he did way more
drinking than class attending.

75
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:47,232
Pretty soon Dick got the boot.

76
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,861
Then he went back
home to Wyoming

77
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:52,193
where he got a job
working as a lineman

78
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,025
for the state.

79
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,973
Back then, they would have called
a guy like him a nerd-do-well.

80
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,328
In today's parlance

81
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:10,045
I think they would just
call him a dirt bag.

82
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:14,035
Man down!

83
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:26,878
His leg looks like
an Elvis dance move.

84
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,554
Somebody give that poor son
of a bitch a shot of whiskey.

85
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:32,798
Alright, back to work.

86
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:35,341
I said, back to work!

87
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:41,195
Take him into town,
put $5 in his pocket.

88
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,008
Find another man for tomorrow.

89
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:44,404
Help.

90
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:47,684
You got a problem Cheney?

91
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,611
- Help me please.
- No sir.

92
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,686
Are we becoming friends?

93
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,756
Will you stop touching me?

94
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:11,631
What? What you gonna do
about it, Mr. Yale?

95
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:18,056
The fuck you gonna do about
it, Mr. Yale? Come on!

96
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,211
Two times...

97
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,638
Two times!

98
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:59,307
I have to drag you out
of that jail like a...

99
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,745
filthy hobo!

100
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,227
- I'm sorry, Lynne.
- What?

101
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,374
- What did you just say?
- I'm sorry, Lynnie.

102
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:09,887
You're sorry? Don't
call me “Lynnie!”

103
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:13,723
You're sorry.

104
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:18,743
One time is “I'm sorry.”

105
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,670
Two times makes me think that
I've picked the wrong man!

106
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:28,482
You already got your ass thrown out
of Yale for drinking... and fighting.

107
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,301
And now you are just gonna be a lush
that hangs power lines for the state?

108
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,514
Are you gonna live in a trailer
and we're gonna have ten kids?

109
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,466
- Is that the plan?!
- Can we discuss this later... Please?

110
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,370
No. We are gonna discuss this right
now, while you smell like vomit

111
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,440
and cheap booze.

112
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,920
- Does Dick want some coffee?
- What?

113
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,512
Mum, get out!

114
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,325
Get out! Does Dick want some coffee?
Jesus Christ!

115
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:52,051
OK. Here's my plan.

116
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,223
Right.

117
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:59,222
Either you stand up straight,

118
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,761
and you get your back straight

119
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,990
and you have the courage to
become someone, or I am gone!

120
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:10,878
I know a dozen guys and a few
Professors at school who would date me!

121
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:12,533
I love you, Lynne.

122
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,710
Then prove it!

123
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,247
Prove it!

124
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:20,852
I can't...

125
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,357
go to a big Ivy League school!
And I can't...

126
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:29,388
run a company or be Mayor! That's
just the way the world is for a girl!

127
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,971
I need you.

128
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:33,623
And right now you're a

129
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:37,478
big fat piss soaked ze-ro!

130
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,263
I've seen my mom waiting up all
night for my father to get home

131
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:50,224
and I've seen my father drunk in
this house and raising his voice

132
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:54,079
and way worse and I'm not dancing
that dance anymore... I'm not!

133
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,940
Do you know why I fuck her?

134
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:03,982
I'm not.

135
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:06,864
So, can you change?

136
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:11,305
Can you change, or am I
wasting my goddamn time?

137
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,031
I won't ever disappoint
you again Lynne.

142
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:51,418
Fellowship, you're a train
goes back one hundred years.

143
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,606
You were chosen because
of your hard work,

144
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,173
your diligence and dedication.

145
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,184
State it simply,

146
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,009
you are America's
best and brightest.

147
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:10,785
So, let's go forward and
learn and be of service.

148
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:15,310
God bless you all...
and God bless this great

149
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,498
nation.

150
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:22,199
And now, I would like to introduce
some young man from Illinois

151
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:25,115
who's done quite well for
himself here in The Capitol.

152
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:29,170
Representative... Donald Rumsfeld.

153
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:40,488
Did Bob tell you
that this internship

154
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:42,681
is a great honor?

155
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,186
Huh?

156
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,279
Did he?

157
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,154
Huh? Yeah?

158
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,889
Well...

159
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,649
it's not.

160
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,372
It's what we called in
the Navy “a shit detail.”

161
00:13:56,513 --> 00:14:00,736
Donald Rumsfeld, or
Rummy as they called him,

162
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,546
was the former captain of the
Princeton wrestling team...

163
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,988
and an elite navy jet pilot.

164
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:11,251
Most Congressmen used
their power like an axe,

165
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,607
Best and brightest.

166
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:16,942
Rumsfeld on the
other hand, used his

167
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,920
like a master of the
butterfly knives.

168
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:25,394
And like any master if you got
in his way, he would cut you.

169
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,523
This can be a great opportunity.

170
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:31,975
An opportunity, to work in the

171
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:37,499
hallways of decision making in the most
powerful country in the goddamn world.

172
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,960
And if that doesn't give you a hard
on, I don't know what will.

173
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:43,117
Sorry to the,

174
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,138
few ladies in the room.

175
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:48,237
This program didn't use to
have girls, now it does.

176
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:51,823
Anyway, I'm done,
whatever you do...

177
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:55,721
Don't work for Bob over here.

178
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:59,871
He's the most boring son of a bitch in DC.
Isn't that right Bob?

179
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:04,375
Alright. That's it. Go, get a
Congressman a cup of coffee!

180
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,609
And if his wife calls, he's
always in a meeting! Alright?

181
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,513
That's it. Scat.

182
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,231
Hey, I'm Alan.

183
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,668
You're the other guy from the
university of Wisconsin right?

184
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:18,470
Right.

185
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:22,784
So, one of us is supposed to start with
a Democrat, the other, a Republican.

186
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,981
Do you care if I go
with the Dem cause

187
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:27,555
I did a lot of work with
the DNC on campus. Umm...

188
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,034
What party is uh...

189
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,046
The guy we just heard?

190
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,358
- Three penises walking down the street.
- Yeah, you know who are the other two.

191
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:39,387
Rumsfeld is a Republican.

192
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:43,523
Perfect, cause uh...

193
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,593
It's what I am.

194
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,496
Don't lurk. Come in dammit.

195
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,380
Dick Cheney...
Reporting for work.

196
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:11,691
You're Congressional relations for
my Office of Economic Opportunity.

197
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:15,336
And you'll assist me in my job
as councilor to the President.

198
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:17,991
Right.

199
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,482
Jesus Christ. You want
me to pin your mittens to

200
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,897
your sleeves, so you don't
fucking lose them? Go!

201
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,078
Oh Cheney,

202
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:29,737
your two DUls came up on your transcript.
Don't worry. I vouched for you.

203
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,166
Thank you sir.

204
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,960
No. Thanks are when your neighbor Dottie
pulls your pud for the first time.

205
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:37,269
You owe me.

206
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:39,391
- Yes sir.
- Go!

207
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:44,407
The first thing our department did

208
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,870
was to conduct a sweeping audit.

209
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:52,010
At the population distribution
across the nation.

210
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:55,329
You'll see the office of
economic opportunity

211
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:56,281
benefits...

212
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:58,023
You're Rumsfeld's lackey right?

213
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,758
Make sure he sees this.

214
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:01,837
You gotta get that
on Nixon's desk, huh?

215
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,794
Roger Ailes,
founder of FOX News.

216
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,659
He first pitched the
idea as conservative news

217
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:10,159
when he worked for
Nixon as a media consultant.

218
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:11,446
Hey Don.

219
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:14,816
Roger wants Nixon to start a
republican news TV network.

220
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,900
Forget it. Roger knows TV.
But he doesn't know politics.

221
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,450
So I would do this flaming
baton trick and Dick

222
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,308
would wait backstage
with a bucket of water.

223
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:29,676
So I'm at the State Finals and I throw
up the baton... and it doesn't come down.

224
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:32,238
Shady.

225
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,766
Oh, where did you find her?

226
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,219
It is doing nothing but damage to
our private healthcare institutions.

227
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,217
But I still got second place.

228
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:44,291
White families, males,
women, Hispanics, minorities.

229
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,537
You're quiet. I like that.

230
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:49,845
You don't go blabbing
about what cards you have.

231
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,663
I missed my flush
draw about a month ago,

232
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:56,380
but everybody still thinks
I have pocket kings.

233
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:57,888
Except maybe fucking Haldeman.

234
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:00,530
I mostly play
hearts, so I'm not...

235
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:01,530
No, no...

236
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:03,882
For a man like Donald Rumsfeld,

237
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:07,496
he only wanted three
things from his lackey.

238
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:10,734
He had to keep his mouth shut,

239
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,468
do what he was told

240
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:16,965
and always, always...

241
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:17,996
be loyal.

242
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,840
What it means is, Nixon likes
me, but his circle hates me.

243
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,033
- No, I'm sure that's not true.
- So...

244
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,693
What's it gonna be?
Is it a yes, or a no?

245
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:26,789
It's a yes.

246
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:29,263
You don't even know what
the question is, do you?

247
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:32,466
- I am assuming...
- No, no, no. It's OK.

248
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,899
That's exactly the kind of
“yes” I was looking for.

249
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:39,512
Cheney had always been a so so
student and a mediocre athlete,

250
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:44,142
But now finally he had
found his life's calling.

251
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:49,668
He would be a dedicated and
humble servant to power.

252
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,298
Here's your new office.

253
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,622
No windows, but all you'd see are a
bunch of hippies flipping off Nixon.

254
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,318
Alright then.

255
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:03,408
Now,

256
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,901
at this point, you're
probably wondering

257
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,100
who exactly I am.

258
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:12,095
Well, let me introduce myself.
My name is Kurt.

259
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:15,243
My favorite football
team is The Steelers.

260
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,773
And me and my son,
we love Spongebob.

261
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:23,293
And if you are wondering how I
know so much about Dick Cheney,

262
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,773
well, let's just say we are...

263
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,848
kind of related...
We'll get to that later.

264
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:43,394
- Hello.
- Lynnie... guess where I'm calling from?

265
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:48,386
I am so proud of you right now
Dick Cheney...

266
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:52,253
I knew I picked the right man.
I knew it even when I didn't...

267
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,222
We did it.

268
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,348
Have you seen Nixon?

269
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,127
I did. I met him.

270
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,562
- I shook his hand.
- Oh my gosh.

271
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,601
He gave me that...

272
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,211
That impish smile of his.

273
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,523
I gotta pinch myself.

274
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,000
Pardon my French.

275
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:19,950
It is the best...
fucking feeling...

276
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,481
in the world.

277
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:24,713
I can only imagine, I am so proud of you.

278
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,593
- I love you.
- We are proud of you.

279
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:29,101
Girls are proud of you.
Are you proud of your daddy?

280
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,184
- Yes.
- You say you're proud of your daddy.

281
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:33,669
Proud of my daddy.

282
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:35,746
Proud of your
daddy, oh my goodness.

283
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:56,013
Dick Cheney's office.

284
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:59,410
So now, that I'm not
just flipping cards

285
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:02,118
- I have a few ideas...
- Stop.

286
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:04,736
See that door?

287
00:21:05,102 --> 00:21:07,187
To Kissinger's office?

288
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,630
That's right.

289
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:12,039
I happen to know that Nixon's
in there right now. Now why

290
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,968
would Nixon not be meeting
Kissinger in the Oval Office?

291
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:17,499
He's having a conversation he
doesn't want to go on the record?

292
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:18,723
Very good.

293
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,755
What is the conversation?

294
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:23,047
They're going to bomb Cambodia.

295
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,853
No, no. That's impossible.
That needs approval by Congress

296
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,331
- No.
- And I go there everyday.

297
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:29,803
Fuck Congress.
Unless you're in it.

298
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:32,472
Then it's the greatest
deliberative body on earth.

299
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:33,983
But we're not, so fuck it.

300
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,366
But didn't the President
campaigned on ending the war?

301
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,301
Shhh, listen to me.

302
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:43,407
Because of the discussion that Nixon
and Kissinger are having right now

303
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:46,335
behind that door,
five feet away from us

304
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,172
in a couple of days, 10
thousand miles away...

305
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,785
a rain of 750 pound bombs

306
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,876
dropped from B-52s,
twenty thousand feet

307
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,475
will hit villages and
towns all across Cambodia.

308
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,325
Thousands will die...

309
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:05,083
The world will change
for better, or worse.

310
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:17,015
That is the kind of power that exists
in this squat little ugly building.

311
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,599
Screw Kissinger, he's overrated.

312
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:21,990
Let's go.

313
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,171
So... what do we...

314
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,057
Spit it out. What
are you trying to say?

315
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:34,672
I mean aren't we against
spending... What do we believe?

316
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,420
What do we believe?

317
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:48,988
What do we believe?!

318
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,535
Oh, that's very good!
What do we believe?

319
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,671
Oh, shit!

320
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:13,999
Like that, through
there, you wanna try?

321
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,013
- Yeah.
- You find out what the

322
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:18,069
fish want, in this
case it's a worm

323
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:19,874
and then uh...

324
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,557
we use it to catch them.

325
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,398
Look here, look here, dad, dad, look.

326
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,690
Family gets to eat.

327
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:28,515
Is it a good trick we're playing?
With the worms?

328
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:31,687
It's not good, or bad.
It's fishing.

329
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:34,255
I don't want this one hurt.

330
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:39,019
Dick had taken a job as a political
consultant for a large financial firm.

331
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,540
Where he was finally
making good money.

332
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,946
He took the job because Nixon's inner
circle have had enough of Donald Rumsfeld.

333
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:49,429
I'm out.

334
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:51,922
They're sending me to Brussels.

335
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,016
- What?

336
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,676
- Nixon is making me

337
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,496
permanent ambassador to NATO.

338
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,397
Or as he called it,
a fuck off assignment.

339
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:03,116
Kissinger and Haldeman won.
I want you to come with me.

340
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,457
I got a four and
a seven year old, Donald.

341
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:11,054
Tell Don we're not moving just because
everyone at the White House hates him!

342
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,444
Good boy. I taught you well
these past couple of years.

343
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,213
I am sorry Don.

344
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:19,248
I really am.

345
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,675
Don't worry. I'm like bed bugs.

346
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:24,550
You have to burn the
mattress to get rid of me!

347
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,982
Dick was becoming sharper and
sharper as a D.C. insider.

348
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:32,892
And Lynne had started
to write articles

349
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,419
and explore ideas
for her first novel.

350
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:36,748
Dick.

351
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:39,151
Dick.

352
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,225
Then...

353
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:44,754
she received news from
back home in Casper.

354
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,082
Lynne's mother Edna,

355
00:24:54,106 --> 00:25:00,295
who had avoided the water her whole life,
was found drowned in the local Casper Lake.

356
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:03,958
They said her and
Wayne, Lynne's Dad,

357
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:07,098
they had had a nasty
argument an hour before.

358
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:08,994
She doesn't swim, Dick.

359
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,662
- My Mother doesn't swim.
- What happened?

360
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,545
She never swam.

361
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:17,239
I don't know. She
just never swims. And then...

362
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:22,771
There was never a serious
investigation into Lynne's mom's death.

363
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:37,833
So listen, after this... What should we do?
Should we go get some food?

364
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:41,025
Girls, Lynne. Why don't
you go to the car?

365
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:46,103
Come on girls. Let's... Listen
to your Father. Alright?

366
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,872
They getting so beautiful Dick.

367
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:58,434
It's amazing.

368
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,815
You catching any fish?

369
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,526
How are you Dick?

370
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:16,807
Things going good in DC?

371
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:22,610
Don't ever go near my
daughters, or my wife again.

372
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:42,653
Big shot!

373
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:46,022
Big shot in D.C. Dick!

374
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:56,221
Sir?

375
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,080
Thanks.

376
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:15,546
So...

377
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,653
- What do you got?
- Page eight.

378
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,279
Hassan Mustafa Nasser.

379
00:27:24,337 --> 00:27:27,084
A cleric based in Milan, Italy.

380
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:30,306
He's a member of
Al-Gama'a Al-Islamiyya,

381
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,178
- the group that killed Anwar Sadat.
- That's The Blind Sheikh, right?

382
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:36,694
There's some debate
at Langley on

383
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,928
- whether they're a threat, or not.
- They claim to be peaceful now.

384
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:43,858
I “claim”

385
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:45,483
to be eating healthy.

386
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,682
Okay...

387
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,588
You'll pick him up.

388
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:26,416
What's the next name?

389
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:30,915
Well Mr. Vice President,
there's been some chatter about

390
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,448
an engineering
student from Berlin...

391
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:38,136
I have never been a quitter.

392
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:41,357
To leave the office before
my term is completed,

393
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,537
is of harm to every
instinct in my body.

394
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,548
But as president,

395
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:51,471
I must put the interest
of America first.

396
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:56,432
America needs a
full time president.

397
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:59,898
Nixon forgot about the voice
activated recorders.

398
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:02,343
He got sloppy.

399
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,617
- Is the President being punished?
- No, no. The President has lot of enemies.

400
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:08,776
Brussels please...

401
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,562
You need to remember

402
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,726
Lizzy...

403
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:18,065
that if you have power, people will
always try to take it from you. Always.

404
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,877
- Yes Ma'am.
- Remember that.

405
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:26,154
- Donald Rumsfeld please...
- This is a tragedy.

406
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:28,003
That is our president.

407
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:31,909
- This is ridiculous.
- I actually think this could be

408
00:29:32,232 --> 00:29:34,229
very, very good news.

409
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:39,588
The way I see it,

410
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:44,275
any Republican not touched by
Watergate is golden right now.

411
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:48,792
Ford called me before my plane took off.
I think we're in.

412
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:50,866
Still...

413
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:52,603
driving this chick magnet, huh?

414
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,204
You can always take the bus.

415
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:59,772
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

416
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:02,725
Vice President Ford

417
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:05,006
will be sworn in as President

418
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:06,268
at that hour.

419
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,741
- So what's the plan?
- Well, the plan...

420
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,144
is to take over
the damn place...

421
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,266
Who lit a fire under your ass?

422
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,978
I haven't flipped cards
for a long time Don.

423
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,527
They gave me

424
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,723
the keys to the damn palace!

425
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:30,121
Chief of Staff.

426
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,605
Holy shit!

427
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,168
You salty son of a bitch.

428
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:36,836
You did it.

429
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:39,703
Part, we have work to do.

430
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:43,336
Kissinger is trying to kiss
and make up with the Soviets.

431
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,861
Well,

432
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,827
let's make sure that
shit doesn't happen.

433
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,197
Yeah.

434
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,544
If I may, I believe
I may have a way

435
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:07,411
to put an ore in the
water, on Russia.

436
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:08,643
What if...

437
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,786
- We create...
- Mr. President.

438
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,152
Come on Henry, let's
hear Dick out.

439
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:16,581
One of Dick Cheney's
special super powers,

440
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:21,385
was the ability to make the
most wild and extreme ideas

441
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,111
sound measured and professional.

442
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:26,642
What if on a unilateral basis,

443
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:30,236
we all put miniature
wigs on our penises

444
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,591
and we walked out to
the White House lawn,

445
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:35,571
and jerked each other off.

446
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:39,789
So, like a puppet show,
but much more enjoyable?

447
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:43,753
I do like a good puppet show.

448
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:45,305
I say we do it.

449
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,928
Henry Kissinger has been
relieved as National

450
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:50,920
Security Adviser and
replaced by Brent Scowcroft.

451
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:55,599
They're calling it the
Halloween Massacre.

452
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,366
- Mr President.
- Hold on...

453
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,497
Donald Rumsfeld has replaced
Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger.

454
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,318
And Dick Cheney has
been chosen, as the

455
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:05,655
the youngest Chief of Staff in history!
It's amazing. It's a dream.

456
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,956
It's real.

457
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:08,578
Don...

458
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:11,082
is the youngest Secretary
of Defense ever.

459
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:15,087
Well, I'm not talking about
Don, I'm talking about you

460
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,360
And I'm going to give you

461
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:21,368
a kiss, right here
in the White House.

462
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:25,902
Excuse me Mr. and Mrs. Cheney. These girls
were trying to enter the Oval Office.

463
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:28,633
Oh dear, oh dear.

464
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,858
- Girls...
- Hey you!

465
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,395
Girls this is not a
playground, please do not...

466
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:38,096
Is this where Santa lives?

467
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:42,135
It's even better,
it's even better.

468
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,105
This...

469
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:45,836
is where

470
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,805
the leader

471
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,858
of the greatest
nation on earth lives.

472
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,179
- Are you one of his elves Daddy?
- In a way, yes.

473
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:58,470
No he's not Mary. Your
Father is Chief of Staff.

474
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:00,669
Chief... Of Staff.

475
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:04,343
If you're silly with her
she'll grow up to be a silly woman.

476
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,130
Right, of course.

477
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:08,927
I forgot, that's just

478
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:10,872
that's just silly, Mary.

479
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:13,446
And as the new Chief of Staff

480
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,314
and with the Presidency
weakened by Watergate,

481
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:21,420
Dick Cheney wanted to find out exactly
how much power did the President have.

482
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:24,489
I would like to reinstate
Executive Authority

483
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:25,915
Now.

484
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,818
Antonin Scalia,

485
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:29,866
a young lawyer with the
justice department

486
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,740
who would later go on to serve
on the Supreme Court,

487
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:34,225
rocked Dick's world.

488
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:35,842
Interesting you should ask.

489
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:39,295
Are you familiar with the
theory of the unitary executive?

490
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,945
No. Tell me about it.

491
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,329
There is an
interpretation that few

492
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:46,369
like myself happen to believe, in
Article two of the Constitution

493
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,852
that vests the President

494
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:50,537
with absolute
executive authority.

495
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,225
And I mean absolute.

496
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:07,109
Baby, baby...

497
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,497
you wanna take Cole
to the high chair?

498
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,947
- Come on buddy.
- I've gotta try

499
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:14,287
and explain this
thing to the people.

500
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,005
Aren't you hungry?

501
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:21,072
The Unitary Executive Theory.

502
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:25,822
Certain legal scholars believed
that, if the President does anything

503
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:28,947
it must be legal, because
it's the President.

504
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,260
To hell with checks
and balances,

505
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:34,068
especially during times of war.

506
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:37,449
This was the power of kings,

507
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,767
pharaohs, dictators.

508
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,193
This is perfect.

509
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:46,664
Dick Cheney was a foot soldier in
the power games of Washington DC.

510
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:49,696
But with the Unitary
Executive Theory,

511
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,068
he could become Galactus,
devourer of planets.

512
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:59,851
But then, it was Election Day.

513
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:02,378
- And there was one big problem...
- Carter is the winner with

514
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,753
two hundred and seventy
two electoral votes...

515
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:07,332
we have wondered which of us
gonna make this announcement

516
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:12,051
James Earl Carter, the next
President of the United States.

517
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:13,736
And just like that...

518
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:15,644
it was all over.

519
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:20,456
Dick Cheney, the president's chief
of staff, he does not have a job.

520
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:23,929
It can't be. It's got to be some
sort of a mistake, or miscalculation.

521
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:25,911
There goes the neighbourhood.

522
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:32,375
Well, thank you all.

523
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:36,672
The Republicans have
lost the Presidency.

524
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:41,180
They are the minority in Congress in most
states. With America demanding change

525
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:47,458
And President Carter went up on
the roof of The White House today,

526
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:50,468
to show off the new solar
water heaters installed there.

527
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:53,079
Today, and directly
harnessing the power of the

528
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:55,888
sun, we are taking the
energy that God gave us.

529
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:59,297
The most renewable energy
that we will ever see.

530
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:03,904
And using it to replace our
dwindling supplies of fossil fuel.

531
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,474
There is no longer any
question that solar energy...

532
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,280
Well, not me, not me, sir.

533
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:48,473
I will become the
gentleman from Wyoming.

534
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,798
Most of all, and hear this...

535
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,388
Taxes must go down.

536
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,384
I'll say it again,
taxes must go down

537
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:58,989
we must ameliorate pain of
taxes for the working man...

538
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,452
and bring...

539
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:04,322
perspicacity to the fore.

540
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:12,474
Thank God for name recognition.

541
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,025
Well, enough of
the horsing around.

542
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:19,676
Although, that is of course,
what us cowboys do.

543
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,112
Vote for Cheney in Congress.

544
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:28,125
I will not let you down,
you can count on me.

545
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:31,734
And uh, thank you,
and vote for Cheney...

546
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,461
in congress.

547
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:38,385
Either he drinks
next time, or I do.

548
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,035
I, uh...

549
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,878
I don't want anyone
to panic, but...

550
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:47,809
But I do believe I have
to go to the hospital.

551
00:37:48,937 --> 00:37:50,598
Now.

552
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,195
It's an inferior wall infarct.

553
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:06,421
But that can be fixed, right?

554
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:09,716
If it was up to me you'd
drop out of the election.

555
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:14,044
But you've both made that
clear that it's not an option.

556
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:17,832
So you must have a minimum
of two weeks bed rest.

557
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,949
Two weeks off.
We'll lose our lead.

558
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:21,884
Like hell we will.

559
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:25,673
Dick Cheney has an illness,
so he can't be here today.

560
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:27,746
But we got his his wife.

561
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,259
And she's a darn pretty girl.

562
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:32,431
Lynne Cheney!

563
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,731
Hello!

564
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:37,791
Hello, how are you today?

565
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:40,959
Good, good, good to hear.
It's really nice...

566
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:43,358
to be back in my home state.

567
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:45,336
See, I grew up in Wyoming.

568
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:49,000
But it seems that somewhere
along the line...

569
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:52,945
Washington DC stopped listening
to real folks like us!

570
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:54,939
And started only listening...

571
00:38:54,963 --> 00:39:00,186
to liberal snobs who want us all to
lose our jobs to affirmative action!

572
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,217
Okay Lynne...

573
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:07,162
That's right.

574
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:08,899
You know, I am...

575
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:13,631
went to New York City, women in
New York City are burning their bras.

576
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,608
Well you know what women in
Wyoming do with our bras?

577
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,171
We wear them!

578
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:22,469
We wear them.

579
00:39:23,023 --> 00:39:26,097
Here in Wyoming we believe
there is a right and wrong.

580
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,451
Because I'm a mom and
a wife from Wyoming.

581
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:33,678
And I know how it feels
to make every penny count.

582
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:37,312
Not only do I speak for you,
but my husband Dick Cheney...

583
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:41,036
A hard wind of change had been
blowing through America.

584
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:45,298
Civil rights, Roe versus
Wade, environmentalism.

585
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,672
But there was a part of the country
that was angry about this change.

586
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:51,357
Thanks to...

587
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:54,172
My amazing wife...

588
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:58,593
It's good to be joining
you all here in D.C.

589
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,945
as Wyoming's sole
Congressional Representative!

590
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:03,914
And then...

591
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:07,460
big money families like
the Kochs and the Coors

592
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:10,824
that were sick of paying
income taxes, rolled

593
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:14,853
right into Washington DC and
started writing fat checks

594
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:17,283
to fund right-wing think tanks.

595
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,756
That would change the way many
Americans looked at the world.

596
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:27,712
Finally in 1980,

597
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:30,617
this unlikely revolution
of the super rich

598
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,452
and white conservatives
found its face.

599
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:35,865
For those without skills,

600
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:38,646
we will find a way to
help them get new skills.

601
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,701
For those without
job opportunities,

602
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:43,303
we will stimulate new
opportunities particularly

603
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:45,472
in the inner cities
where they live.

604
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:47,597
For those who have
abandoned hope,

605
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:51,615
we'll restore hope, and we'll welcome
them into a great national crusade...

606
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:54,113
to make America great again!

607
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:07,386
It was...

608
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:10,625
The fucking 1980's...

609
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:13,830
and it was a hell of a
time to be Dick Cheney.

610
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:21,755
Vote on HR4445 the
undetectable fire arms act

611
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,378
to ban plastic guns that
can evade metal detectors.

612
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,626
Thank you Congressman Cheney.

613
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:32,337
I hear you have
been quite the ally.

614
00:41:54,122 --> 00:41:56,900
Someone call an ambulance!

615
00:41:58,052 --> 00:42:01,775
- Can you breathe?
- I'm having a heart attack, you idiot...

616
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,723
Very nice to see you.

617
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:44,531
Thank you.

618
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,644
They're both
brilliant, but broke.

619
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:53,519
Hey Dick!
Hello Lynne!

620
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,845
- Congratulations on your appointment.
- Well, thank you Mr. Vice President.

621
00:42:57,869 --> 00:42:59,392
How is your lovely family?

622
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,553
Well, we think our son Jeb
seems cut out for office.

623
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:06,874
We may be asking you for
endorsements in a few years.

624
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:08,860
Oh well, if he's half
as charming as you are

625
00:43:08,884 --> 00:43:10,758
George, then he'll
have both of our votes.

626
00:43:10,782 --> 00:43:13,469
- Ah, can I get that in writing?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

627
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:16,050
Dick, I just wanted to say
thank you for getting the House

628
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:18,799
not to override the President's
veto the fairness doctrine.

629
00:43:18,823 --> 00:43:22,768
Not a problem. Happy to get rid
of any big government regulations.

630
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,099
Thank you.

631
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:26,506
The fairness doctrine was
a law from the forties

632
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,533
that required any
broadcast TV, or radio news

633
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:32,583
to present both sides
of an issue equally.

634
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:35,924
Its repeal would lead to
the rise of opinion news.

635
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:40,342
Let me tell you something, you
skinny, human prophylactic.

636
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:43,343
Love is the only human
emotion that you can't

637
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,898
fake except women, and
thank God they can.

638
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:52,102
And eventually to the realization
of Roger Aile's dream.

639
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:54,051
FOX news,

640
00:43:54,075 --> 00:43:58,450
which would go on to become the no.
1 news station in the United States

641
00:43:58,473 --> 00:44:01,884
and swing America even
more to the right.

642
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,046
Alright. Lighten up sweet heart!
It's a party!

643
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,725
Let me go see, if I can see, if
everything's okay over there.

644
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:15,579
Great to see you both.
Love to the girls...

645
00:44:15,603 --> 00:44:17,981
- Love to Barbara.
- Will do.

646
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:20,732
- That's his son.
- Oh, crap.

647
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:23,523
George W, the black
sheep of the family.

648
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,090
A little too much
unconditional love there.

649
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:32,098
Can you feel it Dick?

650
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,062
Half the room wants to be us

651
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:36,247
the other half fears us.

652
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,576
I know George is
next in line but,

653
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:42,842
after that, who knows?

654
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:46,764
I respect the hell out of Reagan.

655
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:52,609
But no one has shown the world the
true power of the American Presidency.

656
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,683
Excuse me Miss Mary!

657
00:45:21,707 --> 00:45:25,516
You cannot leave the grounds
during school hours! Mary!

658
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:35,892
What, I don't
understand you just...

659
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,728
left school? Why? It
doesn't make sense.

660
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,650
It was Susan...

661
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:45,523
Susan... Your best friend?

662
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:50,393
Oh, honey, did you get in
a fight over a boy, or...

663
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:57,310
She broke up with me.

664
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,683
Mom... Dad...

665
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,197
I like girls...

666
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:09,498
I'm gay.

667
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,191
It doesn't matter sweetheart.

668
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,832
We love you no matter what.

669
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:38,902
Daddy!

670
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,516
- I love you so much.
- I love you Mary.

671
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:46,441
This is going to make things...

672
00:46:46,465 --> 00:46:48,493
so hard for you.

673
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,329
When George Bush Sr.
Was elected President,

674
00:46:58,353 --> 00:47:01,795
Dick Cheney was made
Secretary of Defense.

675
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:04,483
Sixth in line to the Presidency.

676
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,085
And after a few years,

677
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:09,582
it was Dick's turn
to run for President,

678
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:13,473
so they decided to do some
early polling numbers.

679
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,436
Oh, yeah, that's it?

680
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:20,217
We can move those numbers...
just...

681
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:24,701
Go after the welfare state,
regulations, government waste...

682
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:29,416
I can't put Mary through that.

683
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:33,916
Every primary opponent
will go after her...

684
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:40,985
And we deny.

685
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:45,766
Shame them for going after
the family and...

686
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:34,916
Who is calling on
a Sunday morning?!

687
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,971
I don't know.

688
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:44,337
I'm coming.

689
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:49,048
Hello.

690
00:49:52,316 --> 00:49:53,915
That's right.

691
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,558
Any way I can be of assistance.

692
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,443
Yeah. That should work... 3pm...

693
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,920
Of course...

694
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:15,705
That...

695
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,231
goes without saying...

696
00:50:20,028 --> 00:50:21,267
Thank you.

697
00:50:21,512 --> 00:50:22,863
Thank you.

698
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,736
Who is that?

699
00:50:26,304 --> 00:50:27,996
It was someone from...

700
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,607
- George Bush's son's campaign.
- Jeb?

701
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:35,327
No. George W... Jeb's Florida.

702
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:36,462
Right. Right.

703
00:50:36,486 --> 00:50:40,231
Oh, I still can't believe they've got
that poor boy running for President.

704
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:42,654
What they want?

705
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:47,294
They want to talk to me
about being his running mate.

706
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:50,044
What?

707
00:50:51,192 --> 00:50:54,142
They didn't say it
outright, but...

708
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,775
I've made that call myself

709
00:50:57,185 --> 00:50:58,916
that's what they want.

710
00:51:00,286 --> 00:51:02,924
Vice President is a nothing job.

711
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:07,801
Gonna just hear them out.

712
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:08,989
I owe that to the father.

713
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:11,916
The VP just sits around,
and waits for the

714
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,041
President to die.
You've said so yourself.

715
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,695
- Yeah it's a credit job.
- Yeah.

716
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,453
That's just a meeting.

717
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:23,880
Is it just a meeting?

718
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,735
It's just a meeting.

719
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:33,686
Good.

720
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,866
Yes, Mr. Governor?

721
00:51:57,932 --> 00:51:59,265
Of course.

722
00:52:00,307 --> 00:52:02,835
The Governor will see
you now Secretary Cheney.

723
00:52:08,288 --> 00:52:09,668
Sure.

724
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:14,560
Hey, hello Dick.

725
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:16,259
Hello, George.

726
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:19,272
- It's been a while.
- Last year...

727
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:21,856
foreign policy sessions.

728
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:23,930
That's right. Yeah, that's right.

729
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,918
Those meetings were...

730
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,684
very engaging.

731
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,484
Do you remember?

732
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:33,351
We both agreed my Dad
would have been reelected

733
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,490
- if he had taken out Saddam.
- Right.

734
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:37,605
Yeah... War time Presidents

735
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:39,778
very popular.

736
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:41,807
That they are. That they are.

737
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,232
So...

738
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:48,786
Congratulations on a...

739
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:51,139
successful primary.

740
00:52:51,163 --> 00:52:52,227
I have...

741
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:56,336
been through a few myself and
they can be... Shall we say

742
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,435
- Fucking exhausting!
- Right.

743
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,511
It's a grind.

744
00:53:03,535 --> 00:53:07,376
It's a grind, I tell you.
Buses, baloney sandwiches...

745
00:53:08,178 --> 00:53:12,073
I like people, but I mean,
you know, enough's enough.

746
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,363
So...

747
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,479
- the call I received...
- I forgot

748
00:53:19,503 --> 00:53:22,155
you're a brass tacks guy aren't you?
I like that.

749
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:25,895
Are you surprised I'm
running for President?

750
00:53:25,919 --> 00:53:29,071
He wants to outrace his father.

751
00:53:29,427 --> 00:53:30,827
More than anything.

752
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:33,942
After my, shall we say,
wild years?

753
00:53:33,995 --> 00:53:39,023
Well, Gorge, I sowed some
oats myself back in the day.

754
00:53:39,475 --> 00:53:42,784
And still enjoy a
cold beer on occasion.

755
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:44,651
I bet you did.

756
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:48,797
I bet you did you rascal. Well
I can't anymore. It got bad.

757
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,516
Yeah.

758
00:53:51,052 --> 00:53:52,564
Good times.

759
00:53:52,723 --> 00:53:54,478
What does he really want?

760
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:56,615
What does he need?

761
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:58,563
It's tough, I tell you...

762
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,323
Lost my first congressional
race, that was...

763
00:54:03,669 --> 00:54:05,088
not good.

764
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:10,474
- How about some brisket?
- George... um...

765
00:54:12,063 --> 00:54:13,501
Hey Theresa!

766
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:15,350
Hey Theresa!

767
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:16,718
Get some brisket?!

768
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:18,624
- I will find...
- Get the burnt ends!

769
00:54:18,648 --> 00:54:21,035
- 'Course.
- So listen, I've got a...

770
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:24,633
lack of experience
problem in the polls

771
00:54:24,657 --> 00:54:26,483
and you're one of the
most experienced guys around

772
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:29,561
you wanna jump
on board and be my Vice?

773
00:54:30,072 --> 00:54:32,069
I'm honored.

774
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:34,334
Don't be honored. Fucking
say yes, Mr. Brass tacks.

775
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,019
I have to say no.

776
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:39,504
Dick c'mon, we'll
have a lot of fun.

777
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:41,298
What are you doing right now?

778
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:43,707
- You in the private sector?
- Yeah.

779
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:47,634
- Come on. I know you love politics.
- No. George.

780
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,900
- Let's go.
- Not gonna happen.

781
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:51,210
Come on now!

782
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,144
That's a shame. It is.

783
00:54:57,855 --> 00:55:00,399
Perhaps I could...

784
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:04,075
help you find the
right running mate.

785
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:08,326
- Run my VP search team?
- No team. Just me.

786
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:17,068
Yeah, yeah, that could work.

787
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:19,831
I'll have to run it
by Rove of course, but...

788
00:55:21,296 --> 00:55:25,566
if I lose maybe I can become
commissioner of baseball, you know!

789
00:55:25,968 --> 00:55:27,332
But the...

790
00:55:27,617 --> 00:55:29,153
idea...

791
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:31,172
is to win?!

792
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:34,987
I'm going to keep you
in the back of my mind.

793
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:45,520
So are you going to tell me
how it went today, or not?

794
00:55:49,034 --> 00:55:51,250
It was... very interesting.

795
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,086
He is a...

796
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:57,001
green.

797
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,524
He's very green.

798
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:04,235
And you told him no?

799
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:05,920
I, uh...

800
00:56:05,944 --> 00:56:08,066
I told him I would help

801
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:10,328
with the...

802
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:12,985
search.

803
00:56:27,361 --> 00:56:28,967
What are you thinking?

804
00:56:31,144 --> 00:56:33,141
I can tell you're thinking.

805
00:56:40,298 --> 00:56:42,951
What was Dick Cheney thinking?

806
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:45,977
I'm thinking I've never
seen anything like this.

807
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:49,073
After his first
meeting with George W.

808
00:56:49,097 --> 00:56:52,007
We've had a lot
of successes Dick.

809
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,029
The Vice President...

810
00:56:57,157 --> 00:56:58,940
is a nothing job.

811
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:02,232
How many steps ahead
was he looking?

812
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:06,751
How did he feel about the
opportunity that was in front of him?

813
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:09,579
There are...

814
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:12,896
certain moments, so delicate...

815
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:16,943
like a teacup and saucer...

816
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:23,507
stacked on a teacup
and saucer...

817
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,963
on a teacup...

818
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:27,843
and saucer.

819
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:32,897
And on and on.

820
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:42,595
That this moment could
fall in any direction...

821
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,642
and change everything.

822
00:57:48,982 --> 00:57:51,603
Sadly there is no
real way to know

823
00:57:51,627 --> 00:57:56,229
exactly what was going on inside the
Cheneys at this history changing moment.

824
00:57:56,603 --> 00:58:00,746
We can't just snap into
a Shakespearean Soliloquy

825
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:04,430
that dramatizes every
feeling and motivation.

826
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,188
It's just not the
way the world works.

827
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:17,733
My sweet Richard.

828
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:20,965
Dance'd nimbly round the
King's hearth thou hath.

829
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,992
Even whilst clamored I for more,

830
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:25,361
more!

831
00:58:25,385 --> 00:58:30,350
Parched maw craned towards the
drip, drip of imagined waters.

832
00:58:30,815 --> 00:58:32,773
But I say to you now,

833
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:35,020
rest, retire.

834
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:37,636
Thou hast honored thy vows to

835
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,735
wife and crown.

836
00:58:40,136 --> 00:58:43,969
Has blindness usurped
vision in you my wife?

837
00:58:46,475 --> 00:58:49,722
No mere treaty is our union!

838
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:55,916
Thou shared thy torch's flame with
mine revealing halls and spires of

839
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:58,996
long faded empires.

840
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:03,075
And now, I, may hold aloft

841
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:06,035
mine own fiery credit

842
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,082
to make flesh our bond of power.

843
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,675
Dare I?

844
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:19,694
Dare I let hope's peak place gathered
bramble upon my heart for future's nest?

845
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:23,389
Many winters past hath
I let this hope die,

846
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,251
cruel winds silencing
tiny birds needy cries.

847
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:30,306
Now that it hath
arrived I say yea, yea!

848
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,311
Yea!

849
00:59:32,915 --> 00:59:35,630
Mine own blood and will

850
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,291
are yours,

851
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:40,596
til pierced be the last
soldier's breast plate,

852
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,671
spilling forth its
ruby jellied treasures!

853
00:59:54,203 --> 00:59:55,410
So...

854
00:59:56,023 --> 00:59:59,825
So... I think we... proceed.

855
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:02,520
What about Mary?

856
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,642
It's VP.

857
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:07,927
Not the same scrutiny.

858
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,712
He has allies Dick.

859
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:15,665
Connections. You're new to his world.
You don't know the landscape.

860
01:00:21,181 --> 01:00:23,057
I had better

861
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:26,185
conduct a very thorough search.

862
01:00:26,782 --> 01:00:28,959
Every stone. Hell,

863
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:31,130
every grain of sand

864
01:00:31,134 --> 01:00:33,025
needs to be looked under
for this questionnaire.

865
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,720
Dick, we are asking for...

866
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:39,209
all financials, all medical,
all interviews, press, writings,

867
01:00:39,237 --> 01:00:40,800
all legal records,

868
01:00:40,824 --> 01:00:42,883
family medical and
family financials.

869
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:43,849
And?

870
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:46,411
Any more “comprehensive”
and we'd need a rubber glove.

871
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:47,599
Sorry Liz.

872
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:50,245
That wasn't offensive.
Should I be offended?

873
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:52,848
I'm offended. Dave didn't
worry, if I'd be offended.

874
01:00:52,872 --> 01:00:56,336
Oh, a rubber glove.
Like a proctology exam.

875
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,830
- That's... that's disgusting.
- Hello!

876
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:00,876
Oh. Hello!

877
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:09,716
David, thoughts?

878
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:12,138
One... big one.

879
01:01:12,766 --> 01:01:14,186
David Addington,

880
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:18,796
Dicks main legal adviser and a huge
believer in the Unitary Executive Theory.

881
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,387
He was known for telling people to
their face that they're stupid.

882
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,618
So the...

883
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,588
Vice Presidency is part
of the executive branch and

884
01:01:27,612 --> 01:01:30,619
because the VP casts tie
breaking votes to the Senate

885
01:01:30,643 --> 01:01:31,916
also part

886
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,265
- of the legislative branch, right?
- Right.

887
01:01:34,452 --> 01:01:35,761
That means,

888
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:38,521
The VP is also...

889
01:01:38,545 --> 01:01:41,807
not part of the executive,
or the legislative.

890
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:43,673
So...

891
01:01:43,697 --> 01:01:46,303
one could argue that

892
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:48,807
neither branch

893
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:51,262
has oversight of the VP?

894
01:01:51,788 --> 01:01:53,715
Not only could “one” argue that

895
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:55,801
I'm arguing you.

896
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,488
- That's brilliant David.
- I know.

897
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:00,144
Right?

898
01:02:00,234 --> 01:02:03,184
Carl Rove want me
to buy this ranch.

899
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:06,731
Distance myself from my years
at Yale and Harvard.

900
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:09,324
Make me more of a man of
the people for the election.

901
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:11,606
Smart.

902
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:17,427
So, we gonna do this thing or what?
I mean, is this happening?

903
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:18,698
No.

904
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:23,347
I have found some very
interesting candidates.

905
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:25,668
If we could schedule,

906
01:02:25,945 --> 01:02:28,765
three hour window to go...

907
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:31,544
No, I meant you. I want
you to be my VP.

908
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,278
- You're the solution to my problem.
- No.

909
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:37,137
I'm CEO of a large company.

910
01:02:38,346 --> 01:02:41,812
I've been Secretary of Defense,

911
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:44,721
I've been Chief of Staff.

912
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:47,961
The Vice Presidency is mostly a

913
01:02:48,417 --> 01:02:51,000
- a symbolic job.
- Right, right.

914
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:53,864
I can see how that wouldn't be

915
01:02:55,446 --> 01:02:58,591
- enticing to you.
- However...

916
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,485
The Vice Presidency
is also defined by

917
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:06,599
The President.

918
01:03:06,775 --> 01:03:09,350
Unless we were to come to a...

919
01:03:10,001 --> 01:03:12,186
different understanding...

920
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:15,233
Uh-huh. Go on.

921
01:03:16,246 --> 01:03:17,775
I'm listening.

922
01:03:19,123 --> 01:03:21,034
I sense that...

923
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:26,552
you're a, kinetic leader. You
make decisions based on instinct.

924
01:03:27,328 --> 01:03:29,119
I am. People have said that.

925
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:32,727
Yeah, yeah, very different.
Very different from...

926
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:34,246
your father,

927
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,080
in that regard.

928
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:37,390
Now,

929
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:41,554
Maybe I can handle, some of the
more mundane jobs

930
01:03:41,578 --> 01:03:44,239
overseeing bureaucracy,

931
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,512
managing military,

932
01:03:46,627 --> 01:03:50,131
uh energy, uh, foreign policy.

933
01:03:56,094 --> 01:03:57,608
That sounds good.

934
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:05,096
There won't be the kind of
team owner that pulls the starter

935
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,166
- in the 4th inning.
- Yeah.

936
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,469
That's the manager's job.

937
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,141
One more thing.

938
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:16,266
My daughter Mary,

939
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:19,939
Right... Rove told
me she likes girls.

940
01:04:20,645 --> 01:04:23,130
Now, I know you'll have to...

941
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:25,615
run against gay marriage,

942
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:26,802
in the south,

943
01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:28,359
mid-west and...

944
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:31,843
it is my daughter,

945
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:35,106
and that line is drawn concrete.

946
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:37,340
Don't you say another word.

947
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:39,695
So long as you don't mind
us pushing that messaging,

948
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:41,648
we're okay with you
sitting that one out.

949
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:43,499
I think it's
important for all the

950
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:45,957
all the Marys in
the world, you know?

951
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,457
No problemo. We got a deal?

952
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:51,958
Then I believe...

953
01:04:51,982 --> 01:04:53,408
this can work.

954
01:04:54,794 --> 01:04:56,026
Hot damn!

955
01:04:56,836 --> 01:04:58,140
Well, good.

956
01:04:58,164 --> 01:04:59,450
Hey...

957
01:04:59,914 --> 01:05:01,685
let's celebrate!

958
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:03,310
Cheers!

959
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:08,187
I realized

960
01:05:08,307 --> 01:05:09,616
best choices

961
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,320
standing by my side.

962
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,760
Please welcome, my friend
and my running mate,

963
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,987
Dick Cheney.

964
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:27,979
Dick never filled out his own
83 question questionnaire.

965
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:30,926
Full medical records
were never handed over.

966
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:34,494
No tax or corporate
filings, nothing.

967
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,512
Gore rescinded his concession.

968
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:03,418
They're claiming Florida
is too close to call.

969
01:06:04,523 --> 01:06:07,975
He can't fucking
rescind his concession.

970
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,355
He just did.

971
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:12,613
- Russians are loving this.
- There is gonna be a recount.

972
01:06:12,992 --> 01:06:14,540
- So...
- How you doing?

973
01:06:14,564 --> 01:06:16,044
What should we do?

974
01:06:16,867 --> 01:06:19,708
We play it like
we've already won.

975
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,063
Which means,

976
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:24,534
we need to staff
the White House.

977
01:06:25,638 --> 01:06:26,922
Alright.

978
01:06:26,946 --> 01:06:30,060
- Who's leading the transition team?
- I'll do it.

979
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:33,650
That's not something a Vice
President really does, is it?

980
01:06:33,674 --> 01:06:35,044
Uh huh...

981
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:37,078
It is now.

982
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:39,228
Gore has called Governor Bush

983
01:06:39,252 --> 01:06:41,478
and retracted his concession.

984
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:43,131
- No. No!
- What!

985
01:06:53,898 --> 01:06:55,395
Wolfowitz.

986
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,203
State, or Pentagon?

987
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:01,689
Depends on who your
Secretary of Defense is.

988
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:03,317
- Rummy.
- Hundred percent.

989
01:07:03,439 --> 01:07:06,876
- Rumsfeld?
- Doesn't Bush Sr. hate Rummy?

990
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,280
Not such a bad thing with W.
He wants to be his own man.

991
01:07:10,603 --> 01:07:14,339
Rumsfeld believes in a robust Executive.
That's good for us on war powers.

992
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,022
Just keep him out of state,
he'll start World War three.

993
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:23,711
Halliburton just gave us a 26
million dollar exit package.

994
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:25,998
Twice of what we expected.

995
01:07:26,157 --> 01:07:27,841
They're no dummies.

996
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:32,006
Sorry gang.

997
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,950
Thank God. Perhaps I should...

998
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:38,927
go to the hospital.

999
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:42,017
Oh my God! Are you kidding me?

1000
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,764
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

1001
01:07:45,788 --> 01:07:47,917
All persons having business
with the Honorable,

1002
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:49,619
the Supreme Court of
the United States,

1003
01:07:49,643 --> 01:07:52,674
are admonished to draw near and
give their attention, Oh yeah!

1004
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:54,679
For the Court is now sitting.

1005
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:57,941
God bless the United States
and this Honorable Court.

1006
01:07:57,965 --> 01:08:01,562
December 12th 2000. Antonin
Scalia, remember him?

1007
01:08:01,907 --> 01:08:06,247
And the Supreme Court stopped the state
of Florida from completing their recount.

1008
01:08:06,952 --> 01:08:11,554
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were
going to the White House by a margin

1009
01:08:11,578 --> 01:08:14,841
of 537 votes.

1010
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:02,486
Hey, hey, little Mary Claire.

1011
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:05,006
Hey little Mary. My little Mary.

1012
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:06,986
Hey, what are you doing?

1013
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,725
What are you doing?

1014
01:09:13,308 --> 01:09:15,884
Ah, they're both doing really well.

1015
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:18,906
Except I'm trying to
make this dinner and it's

1016
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:20,664
it's a,

1017
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:25,516
Macaroni and Cheese that you said
was easy but it keeps just coming out

1018
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,892
like little watery.

1019
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:30,741
It's the milk, remember.
You gotta add more milk.

1020
01:09:30,862 --> 01:09:33,515
Yeah, make it thicker.

1021
01:09:34,286 --> 01:09:35,872
No, no, no, no.

1022
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:38,079
Yeah, it's much better.

1023
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,299
So much, so much
I wanna say right now.

1024
01:09:41,395 --> 01:09:45,033
You just... You keep doing what
you're doing. You're doing so great.

1025
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:50,657
You have earned something very special...
from your wife.

1026
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,571
Listen! Listen! Listen!

1027
01:09:53,405 --> 01:09:57,879
I'm buying wine... and I'm
picking something up... Chinese?

1028
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:01,666
OK I, I really love you.

1029
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:04,759
I love you.

1030
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:06,085
Yeah.

1031
01:10:16,438 --> 01:10:17,633
Good morning to you too!

1032
01:10:17,657 --> 01:10:19,532
We've met a few times,
it's nice to see you.

1033
01:10:19,556 --> 01:10:20,643
Of course.

1034
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,659
Alright, listen...

1035
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:24,121
We get this thing underway...

1036
01:10:24,145 --> 01:10:27,488
Scooter, why don't you let
everyone know the lay of the land?

1037
01:10:27,512 --> 01:10:30,263
Of course. As you all
know, I am Scooter Libby,

1038
01:10:30,287 --> 01:10:31,923
Dick's Chief of Staff...

1039
01:10:32,425 --> 01:10:34,872
I'm also his national security adviser

1040
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:38,181
and a special adviser
to the President.

1041
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:41,311
Technically, Scooter outranks
any of Bush's people.

1042
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:42,766
Mary Matlin

1043
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:46,673
will serve as councilor to
the VP and assistant to Bush.

1044
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,525
David Addington

1045
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:49,751
Dick's main legal counsel,

1046
01:10:49,775 --> 01:10:54,184
will play center field on all
matters relating to executive power.

1047
01:10:54,538 --> 01:10:57,882
The President has Alberto Gonzales,

1048
01:10:57,906 --> 01:10:59,507
Karl Rove,

1049
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:01,110
Karen Hughes

1050
01:11:01,134 --> 01:11:02,669
as his team.

1051
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:06,080
Quite frankly
Gonzales has no clue,

1052
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:08,539
Rove is a hack,

1053
01:11:09,211 --> 01:11:11,309
Hughes should be
in double A ball.

1054
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:15,029
So, we will have fairly
unobstructed access

1055
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:16,814
to the Oval office.

1056
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,554
We will be automatically

1057
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:23,289
BCC'd on all e-mails that
the President receives,

1058
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:26,802
or sends, as well as have
access to his schedule

1059
01:11:26,806 --> 01:11:29,412
the second it is set, or changed.

1060
01:11:29,658 --> 01:11:33,918
We'll also be receiving the daily
intelligence briefing before

1061
01:11:33,942 --> 01:11:37,033
the President and it gets us
inside the decision curve.

1062
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:39,306
Which will actually be reading.

1063
01:11:40,028 --> 01:11:41,810
Bush approved all of this?

1064
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:44,292
We have...

1065
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,057
an understanding.

1066
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:49,003
What about the e-mails? Paper
shredders don't work for e-mails.

1067
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:52,864
The entire administration will run
off of the RNC's private server.

1068
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:55,589
And we've deactivated
automatic archiving.

1069
01:11:55,613 --> 01:11:56,955
We're clean.

1070
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:00,769
Okay, so over at The
Pentagon we have Don...

1071
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:02,256
Secretary of Defense.

1072
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,717
Paul Wolfowitz, who
worked with Team B

1073
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:08,249
in the Ford days,
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

1074
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:13,266
Let's check, see, what plans
they have to invade Iraq.

1075
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,895
It's already in the works.

1076
01:12:14,919 --> 01:12:17,408
Got Ashcroft over at the DOJ.

1077
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:21,756
State, seems to be the only tricky
department. That's Colin Powell

1078
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,539
his guy Lawrence Wilkerson.

1079
01:12:23,563 --> 01:12:25,687
Collin Powell who never
run a camp he didn't like.

1080
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:27,173
Wilkerson is a true believer.

1081
01:12:27,197 --> 01:12:30,497
We've got Bolton over there. He's
a loose cannon, but he's loyal.

1082
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:34,393
I want to get Liz in there as well.
Let's make sure that happens.

1083
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,624
OK Dick, consider it done.

1084
01:12:36,776 --> 01:12:38,731
And this list of

1085
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,981
“our” people doesn't include

1086
01:12:41,005 --> 01:12:42,865
about 800 others

1087
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:47,542
lobbyists, industry insiders that
we placed in the regulatory jobs.

1088
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:50,668
What about Bush's friends?
Ridge, Pataki, Thompson?

1089
01:12:50,692 --> 01:12:52,082
I haven't heard their names.

1090
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,887
No, they were not...

1091
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,498
offered jobs in this
administration at this time.

1092
01:12:57,522 --> 01:12:59,656
“Not offered jobs at
this time?” Are you

1093
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,060
even more ruthless, than
you used to be there Dick?

1094
01:13:02,084 --> 01:13:04,214
You're just not getting laid.

1095
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,134
Alright, moving on!
We got Paul O'Neill.

1096
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:20,441
You haven't been
here over 20 years.

1097
01:13:20,465 --> 01:13:21,848
Times have changed.

1098
01:13:21,872 --> 01:13:25,595
We have softer touch,
that's the norm now.

1099
01:13:25,997 --> 01:13:28,699
We have the conservative TV

1100
01:13:28,723 --> 01:13:31,181
radio, doing the yelling for us

1101
01:13:32,614 --> 01:13:35,493
Is your old friend embarrassing you?
Is that it Dick?

1102
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:40,120
Soft touch.

1103
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,345
That's all.

1104
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:44,619
Alright. I have to go to my office
at the House of Representatives.

1105
01:13:44,643 --> 01:13:47,983
You mean the senate, Vice President,
tie breaker in the senate.

1106
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,444
Nope, I mean the house.

1107
01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:55,663
Dick Cheney had used an old
connection with former wrestling coach

1108
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:57,755
and speaker of the
house, Dennis Hastert

1109
01:13:57,779 --> 01:14:00,292
to get an office at the
House of Representatives.

1110
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:02,717
The house is where
revenue bills originate

1111
01:14:02,741 --> 01:14:04,999
and he wanted to be
near the money faucet.

1112
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,540
Hey Dick!

1113
01:14:06,564 --> 01:14:08,528
Will this work for you?

1114
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:11,161
Two more offices
in the Senate...

1115
01:14:11,789 --> 01:14:15,880
Hey Dick. I found this extra office.
I hope it works for you.

1116
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:17,857
One in the Pentagon.

1117
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:20,610
Welcome to your new
home away from home.

1118
01:14:20,634 --> 01:14:23,327
I got you a little
house warming gift.

1119
01:14:23,882 --> 01:14:27,624
And later when Cheney needed
intelligence to invade Iraq,

1120
01:14:27,648 --> 01:14:29,563
a conference room at the CIA.

1121
01:14:29,587 --> 01:14:32,223
The room is
soundproof and secure.

1122
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:35,791
Cheney was everywhere.

1123
01:14:35,962 --> 01:14:38,896
But the most powerful
place in all of DC was

1124
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:41,061
a non descript conference room

1125
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:45,394
for relatively new think tank
called Americans for Tax Reform.

1126
01:14:45,696 --> 01:14:50,966
Grover Norquist ran the anti-tax group with
huge funding from the Koch brothers network

1127
01:14:51,076 --> 01:14:53,198
big oil and big tobacco.

1128
01:14:54,232 --> 01:14:57,397
His Wednesday meeting
as it was called

1129
01:14:57,421 --> 01:14:59,436
had become the center

1130
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,371
of the Republican world.

1131
01:15:02,328 --> 01:15:04,262
Well, let's go ahead and start

1132
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:06,395
with the estate tax.

1133
01:15:07,052 --> 01:15:09,294
Now this has been
hard to eliminate

1134
01:15:09,318 --> 01:15:13,947
because the tax only affects
those estates with over 2 million.

1135
01:15:14,091 --> 01:15:15,994
But we have made strides

1136
01:15:16,436 --> 01:15:19,902
and marketing guru Frank
Luntz is here to help.

1137
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:26,966
Hello all.

1138
01:15:28,492 --> 01:15:32,423
Getting regular people to support
cutting taxes on the very wealthy

1139
01:15:32,447 --> 01:15:34,419
has always been extremely hard.

1140
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:37,242
We have had some
success in the past.

1141
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:40,309
But these estate taxes has
always been very difficult.

1142
01:15:41,213 --> 01:15:42,483
However...

1143
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:45,745
I think we may have
had a breakthrough.

1144
01:15:46,186 --> 01:15:48,394
Now, the Estate Tax

1145
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:49,964
kicks in

1146
01:15:50,077 --> 01:15:54,089
on anyone inheriting
over $2 Million dollars.

1147
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,425
How many of you have
a problem with that?

1148
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:58,273
Okay.

1149
01:15:58,297 --> 01:16:01,264
How many of you would have a
problem with something called a

1150
01:16:01,288 --> 01:16:03,082
“death tax?”

1151
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:10,442
Instead of global warming,

1152
01:16:10,822 --> 01:16:13,538
which we all agree
sounds very scary,

1153
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:16,791
we call it

1154
01:16:17,677 --> 01:16:18,966
climate change.

1155
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:22,776
Folks, the government is taking
your money after you die!

1156
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,903
It's a death tax...

1157
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:37,892
The death tax has to go.

1158
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:42,428
The elite liberals at Washington would tax
us for laughing, or crying if they could.

1159
01:16:42,452 --> 01:16:46,600
So with one of the biggest
media and political machines

1160
01:16:46,624 --> 01:16:48,316
ever created behind him

1161
01:16:49,335 --> 01:16:52,730
Cheney was able to squash
action on Global Warming

1162
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:58,056
cut taxes for the super rich and got
regulations for massive corporations.

1163
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,256
And then there was Cheney's National
Energy Policy Development Group.

1164
01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:04,081
His first major test

1165
01:17:04,105 --> 01:17:06,488
to expand executive power.

1166
01:17:06,512 --> 01:17:08,615
I don't understand what
the goddamn problem is!

1167
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:11,421
I want to hear what the energy
CEOs need and I'm not allowed to?

1168
01:17:11,445 --> 01:17:12,649
It's called FACA.

1169
01:17:12,673 --> 01:17:15,375
- The hell is FACA?
- It's the Federal Advisory Committees Act.

1170
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:18,209
Congress got their panties
in a bunch that you know,

1171
01:17:18,352 --> 01:17:21,873
elected officials would
just let CEOs roll in and,

1172
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:23,685
you know, write the laws.

1173
01:17:25,181 --> 01:17:27,172
The Act demands that

1174
01:17:27,196 --> 01:17:31,459
appropriate government employees...
be present.

1175
01:17:31,509 --> 01:17:33,248
Hold on a second.

1176
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:35,673
What's your name?

1177
01:17:35,997 --> 01:17:37,291
Doug.

1178
01:17:37,472 --> 01:17:42,062
Doug, how long have you been working
reception at the Department of Energy?

1179
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:44,430
Three months?

1180
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:46,356
Perfect.

1181
01:17:49,702 --> 01:17:51,998
So what am I
supposed to do here?

1182
01:17:52,022 --> 01:17:54,304
Just sit there and be quiet.

1183
01:17:54,328 --> 01:17:55,597
Got it.

1184
01:18:00,061 --> 01:18:01,339
Gentlemen,

1185
01:18:03,787 --> 01:18:05,011
Hello...

1186
01:18:05,076 --> 01:18:06,276
...

1187
01:18:06,357 --> 01:18:08,655
How's... How's the
business at...

1188
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:11,948
We're good. Our stock...

1189
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,942
And California
has been really...

1190
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:17,540
- since the regulation.
- Great to hear.

1191
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:18,959
Oh...

1192
01:18:18,983 --> 01:18:20,814
He's with the Energy Department.

1193
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:29,460
The details of Cheney's meetings with
the energy CEO's were never disclosed.

1194
01:18:29,898 --> 01:18:34,411
But, a freedom of information
request did provide some documents

1195
01:18:34,774 --> 01:18:36,885
including a map of
Iraq's oil fields

1196
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:39,988
with all of the oil companies
that would be interested

1197
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:41,639
in acquiring them if

1198
01:18:41,793 --> 01:18:45,306
somehow they were ever
to become available.

1199
01:18:48,268 --> 01:18:49,671
And then,

1200
01:18:49,846 --> 01:18:51,025
it happened.

1201
01:18:51,049 --> 01:18:54,350
Would you like to lower your
monthly mortgage payments?

1202
01:18:54,374 --> 01:18:55,879
Or use the equity in your home

1203
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:58,387
to consolidate your credit
card or other debts?

1204
01:18:58,411 --> 01:18:59,609
Just log on...

1205
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:03,986
Yeah, this just in, you are looking at
obviously a very disturbing live shot there

1206
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:07,996
that is the World Trade Center and we
have unconfirmed reports this morning

1207
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:11,313
that a plane has crashed
into one of the towers.

1208
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:16,650
It does not appear that there is
any kind of an effort up there yet.

1209
01:19:16,674 --> 01:19:18,101
Now, remember, oh my God!

1210
01:19:20,582 --> 01:19:21,730
That looks like a second plane.

1211
01:19:21,754 --> 01:19:23,324
Vice President, we have
information that a plane

1212
01:19:23,348 --> 01:19:24,693
is headed to the White
House at this moment.

1213
01:19:24,717 --> 01:19:25,951
We have less than
a minute to get

1214
01:19:25,975 --> 01:19:28,792
to the secure underground bunker.
Let's go! Move!

1215
01:19:29,313 --> 01:19:30,595
Move!

1216
01:19:30,619 --> 01:19:32,631
Move, it's clear.

1217
01:19:33,095 --> 01:19:35,230
Move. The Capitol is being
evacuated, we're told. And

1218
01:19:35,254 --> 01:19:38,441
clearly that shot, that we
have on our screen now

1219
01:19:38,465 --> 01:19:39,985
this is the the
Pentagon, just across

1220
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:42,088
the river from Washington D.C.

1221
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,246
you gotta believe...

1222
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,295
I need you to take me to Dick.

1223
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:48,293
Mrs. Cheney, we cannot go
back to the White House.

1224
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:51,519
I'm being told no one is to go to
the White House. It is not safe.

1225
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,846
You got the Prime Minister yet?

1226
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:15,855
Canada's Prime minister's on the phone.
That's right, we got planes in the air

1227
01:20:15,879 --> 01:20:17,469
nowhere for them to land.

1228
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:20,338
Permission for them to
land at Canadian Airports.

1229
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:22,923
International flights
into Newfoundland.

1230
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:26,922
Sir, Don Rumsfeld is at
the Pentagon, line 2.

1231
01:20:26,946 --> 01:20:29,189
- That?
- Uh huh, yes sir.

1232
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,148
You have authorization

1233
01:20:33,172 --> 01:20:37,403
to shoot down any
aircraft deemed a threat.

1234
01:20:37,406 --> 01:20:38,993
Presidential authority?

1235
01:20:39,017 --> 01:20:41,938
That is correct. All
orders are UNODIR.

1236
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,455
- UNODIR sir?
- Unless otherwise directed.

1237
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:48,993
Mr. Vice President are we sure these
are the proper rules of engagement?

1238
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:52,232
The country's under attack,
the ROE is fluid. David?

1239
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:57,500
Now we don't know what exactly what
the people in that room were thinking

1240
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:58,738
but

1241
01:20:58,762 --> 01:21:03,001
it's safe to assume that at
least one person wondered why,

1242
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:06,846
in the midst of the most
fateful day in American history,

1243
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,354
was Dick Cheney
talking to his lawyer?

1244
01:21:11,739 --> 01:21:13,681
Mr. Vice President,

1245
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:17,478
Mr. Vice President,

1246
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:19,470
the Congressional
Members you sent to

1247
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:21,230
Mount Weather Emergency
Operations Center

1248
01:21:21,254 --> 01:21:23,204
- want to leave.
- Nope.

1249
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:24,819
Excuse me?

1250
01:21:25,713 --> 01:21:28,976
They're not going anywhere.
Just tell them,

1251
01:21:29,705 --> 01:21:31,679
we've all the helicopters.

1252
01:21:31,901 --> 01:21:33,195
Yes, sir.

1253
01:21:33,993 --> 01:21:36,273
Thank you very much for
your call Mr. Prime Minister,

1254
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:38,482
we have the situation
under control.

1255
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,803
Are we at war?

1256
01:21:49,452 --> 01:21:52,066
- Yes we are.
- With whom?

1257
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:25,156
We've picked up chatter from

1258
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,466
well known Al-Qaeda operatives
celebrating today's attack.

1259
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,076
We shouldn't rule out Iraq.

1260
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:34,291
- What's Al-Qaeda's Leader's name?
- His name is Osama Bin Laden.

1261
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,648
But this is clearly Al-Qaeda.
I've been

1262
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:39,485
tracking their movements for years.
They're fingerprints are all over this.

1263
01:22:39,509 --> 01:22:41,888
Iraq has all the good targets.

1264
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:44,564
Iraq has nothing
to do with this, Don.

1265
01:22:44,588 --> 01:22:46,471
- Richard you don't know that for sure.
- I do know...

1266
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,327
Mr. President, if I may,

1267
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:53,641
Afghanistan is Al-Qaeda's headquarters.
That is where our focus should be.

1268
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:56,286
And the CIA would be capable of

1269
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,512
taking out the Taliban's
power structure?

1270
01:22:58,536 --> 01:23:00,815
Yeah, all due respect, George,

1271
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:03,295
Mr. President, we
are the Pentagon.

1272
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:06,156
- And this is what we do.
- Don...

1273
01:23:17,645 --> 01:23:19,368
OK. We'll...

1274
01:23:19,621 --> 01:23:21,591
We'll go with Tenet and the CIA.

1275
01:23:21,615 --> 01:23:23,411
I'll make some calls to our allies.

1276
01:23:23,435 --> 01:23:24,940
Thank you, sir.

1277
01:23:29,344 --> 01:23:31,770
Given the current
situation Mr. President

1278
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:34,274
it is wise that we not

1279
01:23:34,298 --> 01:23:37,376
be in the same location for, COG.

1280
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,248
Continuity of Government.

1281
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,499
Of course.

1282
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:44,796
We're gonna be alright on this...
Are we?

1283
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:47,132
Yes sir.

1284
01:23:47,776 --> 01:23:49,679
Yes, we are.

1285
01:23:53,045 --> 01:23:57,073
Angler has taken off to an undisclosed
location. I repeat, Angler is airborne.

1286
01:23:57,427 --> 01:23:59,510
Angler? That's the VP?

1287
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:02,916
I thought only the President could
land and take off from the south lawn?

1288
01:24:03,232 --> 01:24:05,385
What can I tell you?
Today's fucked.

1289
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:32,547
This intelligence
has been edited

1290
01:24:33,113 --> 01:24:35,430
redacted and reduced.

1291
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:36,852
Mr. Vice President,

1292
01:24:36,876 --> 01:24:39,361
usually we vet the daily
intelligence threat matrix

1293
01:24:39,385 --> 01:24:41,534
to eliminate unreliable
sources, non-players

1294
01:24:41,558 --> 01:24:43,329
Stop! Don't you dare.

1295
01:24:43,353 --> 01:24:46,522
Give me a damn disquisition

1296
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:48,781
on what I cannot hear.

1297
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,297
Mr Vice President, a lot of this
intelligence is not verified.

1298
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:56,468
I'm gonna say this for the last time.
I want to hear everything.

1299
01:24:56,565 --> 01:24:57,808
Everyday,

1300
01:24:57,832 --> 01:24:59,983
- from now on.
- Yes sir.

1301
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,606
Proceed.

1302
01:25:02,476 --> 01:25:06,194
We're tracking the possibility
of bio-attacks using sarin gas,

1303
01:25:06,218 --> 01:25:08,124
cow pox, Ebola...

1304
01:25:08,148 --> 01:25:11,145
There was a post
on a darkweb site

1305
01:25:12,172 --> 01:25:14,845
about mass beheadings
in residential areas.

1306
01:25:14,869 --> 01:25:19,301
Movie studios, museums, subways,
day care centers may all be targets.

1307
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,918
A source has told me asset about
fire bombs targeting hospitals.

1308
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:26,249
A video was captured
describing televised executions

1309
01:25:26,273 --> 01:25:28,545
interrupting
American network TV.

1310
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:42,013
Water filtration plants
targeting bio-weapons...

1311
01:26:07,173 --> 01:26:09,084
I'm scared Dick...

1312
01:26:16,782 --> 01:26:18,724
I'll always take care of you, Lynne.

1313
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:21,529
You know that.

1314
01:26:24,474 --> 01:26:26,603
What are you going to do?

1315
01:27:14,918 --> 01:27:17,356
So while Powell, the CIA

1316
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:19,281
and their international
coalition

1317
01:27:19,305 --> 01:27:23,026
toppled the Taliban and took
Afghanistan in a matter of weeks

1318
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:26,124
Cheney found something
much more powerful,

1319
01:27:26,148 --> 01:27:29,426
than missiles, or jet planes.

1320
01:27:30,132 --> 01:27:32,234
Mr. Vice President,
this is John Yoo.

1321
01:27:32,258 --> 01:27:34,692
It's a pleasure to meet
you Mr. Vice President.

1322
01:27:36,503 --> 01:27:40,179
So, David told me you're looking for...
executive authority.

1323
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,039
John, here is definitely your guy.

1324
01:27:44,037 --> 01:27:45,467
Now, the war

1325
01:27:45,491 --> 01:27:46,687
we are now fighting

1326
01:27:46,711 --> 01:27:50,402
will require resources
and abilities that the

1327
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:53,809
current interpretation of the law

1328
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:55,939
impedes.

1329
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:57,569
The Vice President believes

1330
01:27:57,593 --> 01:28:00,624
it is the duty of The Commander in
Chief to protect the Nation.

1331
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:03,492
And that no other obligation whether
the Congress, or existing treaties

1332
01:28:03,516 --> 01:28:04,919
supersedes that duty.

1333
01:28:05,843 --> 01:28:07,668
How do you feel
about that statement?

1334
01:28:08,734 --> 01:28:10,371
I couldn't agree more.

1335
01:28:11,581 --> 01:28:16,124
John Yoo's first legal opinion
allowed the US government

1336
01:28:16,143 --> 01:28:22,507
to monitor every citizen's phone calls,
texts and e-mails without a warrant.

1337
01:28:22,853 --> 01:28:25,979
It was a giant legal leap

1338
01:28:26,003 --> 01:28:28,850
based on sketchy law at best.

1339
01:28:29,019 --> 01:28:31,707
But John Yoo's masterpiece,

1340
01:28:31,731 --> 01:28:35,524
his Moby Dick, if you will

1341
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:37,791
was the torture memo.

1342
01:28:42,703 --> 01:28:44,942
What about the
Geneva Convention?

1343
01:28:45,694 --> 01:28:48,195
Geneva Convention
is open to... interpretation.

1344
01:28:48,219 --> 01:28:50,020
What exactly does that mean?

1345
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:52,098
Stress positions,

1346
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:54,314
water boarding,
confined spaces, dogs.

1347
01:28:54,338 --> 01:28:56,435
We're calling it
enhanced interrogation.

1348
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:04,071
But torture and privacy laws weren't the
only laws Cheney rewrote with John Yoo.

1349
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,183
They had a full menu

1350
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,893
of legal opinions
stretching and challenging

1351
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:11,222
Constitutional and
International law.

1352
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:12,962
Good evening, gentlemen.

1353
01:29:12,997 --> 01:29:14,684
Tonight we are offering

1354
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,368
the enemy combatant

1355
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:19,744
whereby a person is not a
prisoner of war, or a criminal

1356
01:29:19,768 --> 01:29:23,119
which means of course he has
absolutely no protection under the law.

1357
01:29:23,143 --> 01:29:25,869
We are also offering an
extraordinary rendition

1358
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,480
where suspects are
abducted without record

1359
01:29:28,504 --> 01:29:32,303
on foreign soil and taken to foreign
prisons in countries that still torture.

1360
01:29:32,496 --> 01:29:33,812
Well, that sounds delicious.

1361
01:29:33,836 --> 01:29:35,900
We also have Guantanamo Bay,

1362
01:29:35,924 --> 01:29:37,847
which is very, very complicated

1363
01:29:37,871 --> 01:29:41,831
but it does allow you to operate
outside the purview of due process

1364
01:29:41,855 --> 01:29:44,448
on land which isn't
technically US territory

1365
01:29:44,472 --> 01:29:46,383
but where we still
do have control.

1366
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:49,012
And also we have a very
fresh and delicious

1367
01:29:49,036 --> 01:29:51,214
War Powers Act interpretation,

1368
01:29:51,237 --> 01:29:54,439
which gives the executive
branch broad power to attack

1369
01:29:54,463 --> 01:29:58,158
nations, or people who are deems
still possibly a threat.

1370
01:29:58,182 --> 01:30:01,269
We have the fact that under
the Unitary Executive Theory,

1371
01:30:01,293 --> 01:30:03,275
if the President does anything

1372
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:04,652
it must be legal.

1373
01:30:04,676 --> 01:30:07,207
Which of course means you can
do whatever the fuck you want.

1374
01:30:07,231 --> 01:30:08,720
Sir, gentlemen,

1375
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:10,181
which would you?

1376
01:30:10,918 --> 01:30:13,243
We'll... we'll have them all.

1377
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:14,954
Excellent choice.

1378
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:18,478
Look, Dick...

1379
01:30:18,898 --> 01:30:21,657
we've been working with these
focus groups, advertising

1380
01:30:21,681 --> 01:30:23,947
executives to try and
sell the war on terror.

1381
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:27,577
To reiterate, we are still being
recorded and there still may

1382
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:30,300
or may not be clients back
behind the two way mirror.

1383
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:32,569
These guys are pretty sharp.

1384
01:30:34,874 --> 01:30:38,194
There's a problem. The results
show that people are confused.

1385
01:30:38,218 --> 01:30:40,004
You all support the President.

1386
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:41,826
You hate terrorism.

1387
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:44,238
Yet, you're still confused.

1388
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:45,864
Can you tell me why?

1389
01:30:46,019 --> 01:30:47,531
Anybody?

1390
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:51,489
Don't we just have to just get
Osama bin Laden? He did it.

1391
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:54,669
So why are they calling it a war?
A war with who?

1392
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,657
OK, thank you, Mark. Uh...

1393
01:30:56,681 --> 01:30:58,442
Jasmine, jump in please.

1394
01:30:58,466 --> 01:31:01,106
I don't get what
this Al-Qaeda is.

1395
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:03,575
Are they a country? Like
why can't we just bomb them?

1396
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:05,734
That's really interesting. Um...

1397
01:31:05,758 --> 01:31:08,695
Is anybody else confused
about what Al-Queda is?

1398
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,137
Show off hands please.

1399
01:31:10,304 --> 01:31:14,102
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
that's a lot of you.

1400
01:31:14,126 --> 01:31:15,304
Right?

1401
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,686
Would it be less confusing
if it was a country?

1402
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,590
Damn right. I'm angry as hell.

1403
01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:24,718
We've gotta fuck someone up.

1404
01:31:24,742 --> 01:31:27,821
Got it, Marcus. Really
strong feelings from Marc,

1405
01:31:27,845 --> 01:31:30,196
I'm interested, does
anybody else feels the same.

1406
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:32,647
They understand we are at war, but

1407
01:31:33,048 --> 01:31:34,807
they don't know against who.

1408
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:36,446
They want a country.

1409
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,963
It's cleaner, simpler.

1410
01:31:37,987 --> 01:31:39,715
That would certainly
help us legally.

1411
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:44,734
Looks like it's time to take Iraq.

1412
01:31:46,729 --> 01:31:49,054
It is about goddamn time.

1413
01:31:52,483 --> 01:31:55,071
It's called the Office

1414
01:31:55,095 --> 01:31:56,968
of Special Plans.

1415
01:31:56,992 --> 01:31:59,771
Tenet is not yet serious enough

1416
01:32:00,142 --> 01:32:02,821
about the threat
that Saddam poses

1417
01:32:02,845 --> 01:32:04,654
the global war on terror.

1418
01:32:05,392 --> 01:32:07,118
But I can promise you

1419
01:32:07,142 --> 01:32:09,417
that this intelligence
group will be.

1420
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,368
Wolfie, I got something.

1421
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,651
I think that's an excellent idea.

1422
01:32:18,802 --> 01:32:21,939
Go on take that motherfucker
Saddam down for a long time.

1423
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,869
Here's a report that
says Mohamed Atta

1424
01:32:24,893 --> 01:32:28,924
one of the 9/11 hijackers may have
met with an Iraqi spy in Prague.

1425
01:32:28,948 --> 01:32:32,283
It's really a strong statement, does
anybody agree with that statement?

1426
01:32:32,307 --> 01:32:35,586
Wait a minute, we
can't just bomb people.

1427
01:32:36,186 --> 01:32:38,935
It's from Czech intelligence and
they question its credibility.

1428
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:41,023
I've been to Prague.
They question everything.

1429
01:32:41,047 --> 01:32:43,683
Who wants to be an
“anonymous source?”

1430
01:32:44,334 --> 01:32:45,984
Make sure you work in the phrase

1431
01:32:46,008 --> 01:32:48,310
“we don't want the smoking
gun to be a mushroom cloud.”

1432
01:32:48,334 --> 01:32:50,171
That focus group
through the roof!

1433
01:32:50,195 --> 01:32:52,490
There will always be uncertainty

1434
01:32:52,514 --> 01:32:55,378
about when he'll
acquire nuclear weapons.

1435
01:32:55,381 --> 01:32:57,857
But we don't want
the smoking gun

1436
01:32:57,881 --> 01:32:59,373
- to be a mushroom cloud.
- There is a smoking gun,

1437
01:32:59,397 --> 01:33:03,380
or a mushroom cloud...
if we're waiting too long...

1438
01:33:03,404 --> 01:33:04,741
There is no doubt

1439
01:33:04,765 --> 01:33:07,945
that Saddam Hussein now has
Weapons of Mass destruction.

1440
01:33:07,969 --> 01:33:11,611
We gotta get rid of this dictator. He's
got anthrax. He's got all these weapons.

1441
01:33:11,635 --> 01:33:15,217
There is no doubt, he is amassing them
to use them against our friends.

1442
01:33:15,276 --> 01:33:17,667
Against our allies...
And against us.

1443
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:20,152
When and not if, but when

1444
01:33:20,152 --> 01:33:22,987
Saddam creates and uses
his nuclear weapons...

1445
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:25,236
what will we tell
the American people?

1446
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:28,129
Saddam Hussein will
continue to increase his

1447
01:33:28,153 --> 01:33:31,538
capacity to wage biological
and chemical warfare.

1448
01:33:36,338 --> 01:33:39,303
To show that we will stand up
for what we know to be right.

1449
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,088
To show that we will confront

1450
01:33:41,112 --> 01:33:43,368
the tyrannies and
dictatorships and terrorists

1451
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:45,561
who put our way of life at risk.

1452
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:54,572
Tribe has spoken.

1453
01:33:57,107 --> 01:33:59,459
Polling for an invasion of Iraq

1454
01:33:59,483 --> 01:34:01,528
is at fifty three percent.

1455
01:34:01,544 --> 01:34:04,966
Focus groups show people still
aren't sure about a connection

1456
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:07,416
between Saddam and Al-Qaeda.

1457
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:09,320
And the France and
Germany have both said

1458
01:34:09,344 --> 01:34:11,109
that they will not
join our coalition.

1459
01:34:11,133 --> 01:34:12,857
And neither will Israel.

1460
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:15,717
Harry and I, we went
to the wall together.

1461
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:17,849
We conned. We prayed together.

1462
01:34:17,873 --> 01:34:19,623
Israel is one of
our closest allies.

1463
01:34:19,647 --> 01:34:22,386
They said an invasion
of Iraq would

1464
01:34:22,702 --> 01:34:25,037
destabilize the region, Sir.
And...

1465
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:27,394
they don't believe Saddam
is an immediate threat.

1466
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:29,198
That's not good.

1467
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:31,948
I really want a strong
coalition for this.

1468
01:34:31,972 --> 01:34:33,586
I have an idea.

1469
01:34:33,662 --> 01:34:37,963
Secretary Powell has the highest
trustworthy ratings of all of us.

1470
01:34:38,797 --> 01:34:42,664
What if he gave an address to the U.N.
and the American people

1471
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,822
to push this over
the finish line?

1472
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,028
Karl, I've been very vocal,

1473
01:34:47,052 --> 01:34:49,248
very vocal, about my
reservations about invading Iraq.

1474
01:34:49,272 --> 01:34:53,049
No! Colin, you're such
a nervous Nellie.

1475
01:34:53,249 --> 01:34:55,523
We're talking about invading

1476
01:34:55,547 --> 01:34:59,422
a sovereign nation without
any provocation Don!

1477
01:34:59,446 --> 01:35:01,685
It's a sovereign nation, Don.

1478
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:04,914
What's the exit strategy?
What about the intelligence.

1479
01:35:05,036 --> 01:35:07,457
Does the intelligence
matter to you at all?

1480
01:35:07,481 --> 01:35:08,693
You break it, you bought it.

1481
01:35:08,717 --> 01:35:10,654
You break it, you bought it!

1482
01:35:10,678 --> 01:35:12,619
Hey, hey, hey, alright.

1483
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:15,927
Let's slow down.

1484
01:35:16,657 --> 01:35:18,482
That's enough of that guys.

1485
01:35:20,688 --> 01:35:23,849
Are you going to take
Saddam down, or not?

1486
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:26,700
You are the President.

1487
01:35:29,414 --> 01:35:31,294
War...

1488
01:35:31,781 --> 01:35:33,325
is yours.

1489
01:35:35,016 --> 01:35:36,617
Not...

1490
01:35:36,641 --> 01:35:40,443
the U.N. or some coalition.
Do not share powers

1491
01:35:41,524 --> 01:35:43,521
that are yours alone.

1492
01:35:50,785 --> 01:35:53,688
George, make sure Powell
sees the intelligence.

1493
01:35:54,035 --> 01:35:56,977
- Sir.
- Colin I want you to make that speech.

1494
01:35:57,446 --> 01:35:59,740
I'm President and
I want this to happen!

1495
01:36:01,329 --> 01:36:02,405
Yes sir.

1496
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:04,608
I look forward to being
briefed on that intelligence.

1497
01:36:04,632 --> 01:36:07,538
On another note, I've been
handed a credible report

1498
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:11,090
of a small terrorist enclave
in Northeastern Iraq.

1499
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:13,773
If we're going to invade we
suggest taking it out before.

1500
01:36:13,797 --> 01:36:16,250
Let it go, George, we
have bigger fish to fry.

1501
01:36:16,274 --> 01:36:17,781
Let me see that intelligence.

1502
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,200
Of course.

1503
01:36:19,633 --> 01:36:20,903
That...

1504
01:36:20,927 --> 01:36:22,633
classified document

1505
01:36:22,657 --> 01:36:26,994
described a terrorist
named Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi

1506
01:36:27,018 --> 01:36:29,458
who had started as a
drug dealer and pimp

1507
01:36:29,482 --> 01:36:32,991
before becoming fully radicalized
in a Jordanian prison.

1508
01:36:33,138 --> 01:36:36,299
Zarqawi went to meet Bin
Laden in Afghanistan.

1509
01:36:36,498 --> 01:36:39,432
Did he, or did he not
meet with Al-Qaeda?

1510
01:36:39,474 --> 01:36:43,674
But Zarqawi had vowed
to kill all Shia Muslims

1511
01:36:43,913 --> 01:36:46,831
and Bin Laden's mother was Shia

1512
01:36:47,124 --> 01:36:49,230
so the meeting
didn't go over well.

1513
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:52,132
- They had no operational contact.
- Hogwash.

1514
01:36:52,156 --> 01:36:53,706
Larry...

1515
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,231
have you seen this speech?

1516
01:36:55,255 --> 01:36:57,014
Yes sir. It's beyond thin.

1517
01:36:57,038 --> 01:36:59,561
I saw at least five pieces of
disproved Intel in there.

1518
01:36:59,585 --> 01:37:00,648
Who wrote it?

1519
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:03,164
They said it was the President, but I
think you can guess who really wrote it.

1520
01:37:03,188 --> 01:37:05,715
No, there's no need
to yell, Larry.

1521
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:07,950
Yeah, look.

1522
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:11,559
Well, we'll review the
speech and give some notes.

1523
01:37:13,282 --> 01:37:16,717
Powell really doesn't
have a clue. Does he?

1524
01:37:16,954 --> 01:37:21,920
After the US invaded Afghanistan
Zarqawi set up shop in Iraq.

1525
01:37:22,205 --> 01:37:26,635
It was the only connection Cheney
had between Al-Qaeda and Iraq.

1526
01:37:26,659 --> 01:37:29,118
The Security Counsel
will now begin

1527
01:37:29,142 --> 01:37:32,701
its consideration of
item 2 of the agenda.

1528
01:37:33,098 --> 01:37:36,412
I call now on the distinguished
Secretary of State of

1529
01:37:36,436 --> 01:37:39,669
the United States of
America, his excellency

1530
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:40,968
Mr. Colin Powell.

1531
01:37:40,992 --> 01:37:42,650
My purpose here today

1532
01:37:42,674 --> 01:37:45,079
is to share with you
what the United States

1533
01:37:45,103 --> 01:37:47,870
knows about Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction

1534
01:37:47,885 --> 01:37:50,702
as well as Iraq's
involvement in terrorism.

1535
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:54,324
Iraq today harbors a
deadly terrorist network

1536
01:37:54,348 --> 01:37:57,182
headed by Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi

1537
01:37:57,231 --> 01:37:58,591
an associate and collaborator of

1538
01:37:58,615 --> 01:38:00,858
- Osama Bin Laden.
- Powell's UN Address was seen by

1539
01:38:00,882 --> 01:38:02,252
millions of Americas.

1540
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:05,181
But other people were
watching as well.

1541
01:38:05,205 --> 01:38:08,476
Collaborator of Osama Bin
Laden and his Al-Qaeda lieutenants.

1542
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:10,933
Zarqawi's activities
are not confined...

1543
01:38:10,957 --> 01:38:14,611
The great general of America
saying his name over and over again

1544
01:38:14,635 --> 01:38:16,897
immediately made Zarqawi a star.

1545
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:20,110
Allahu Akbar!

1546
01:38:20,134 --> 01:38:22,165
Within a day he had
gone into hiding

1547
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:23,885
Allahu Akbar!

1548
01:38:23,909 --> 01:38:25,795
Allahu Akbar!

1549
01:38:30,806 --> 01:38:33,001
An Al-Qaeda source tells us that

1550
01:38:33,025 --> 01:38:37,264
Saddam and Bin Laden reached an
understanding that Al-Qaeda would no longer

1551
01:38:37,648 --> 01:38:40,056
support activities
against Baghdad.

1552
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,762
By the time we invaded Iraq

1553
01:38:41,786 --> 01:38:46,220
70% of Americans thought that
Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11.

1554
01:38:48,425 --> 01:38:51,406
Later... Colin Powell
would call the speech

1555
01:38:51,745 --> 01:38:54,531
the most painful
moment of his life.

1556
01:38:57,238 --> 01:38:58,484
Thank you, sir.

1557
01:38:59,282 --> 01:39:02,013
I just push for it, and
it was Justin right?

1558
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:06,949
- No, Kelly, right?
- And then Justin.

1559
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:08,820
- What are you talking about?

1560
01:39:08,844 --> 01:39:11,042
American Idol, dad.

1561
01:39:13,071 --> 01:39:15,555
- You've seen it.
- We watched it at your house.

1562
01:39:15,579 --> 01:39:17,771
The singing and the mean judge.

1563
01:39:20,842 --> 01:39:22,285
Oh, I like him.

1564
01:39:23,631 --> 01:39:26,136
How do you stop a
fish from smelling?

1565
01:39:33,523 --> 01:39:36,152
You just cut off its nose.

1566
01:39:36,249 --> 01:39:38,606
Honestly, was I inspired because...

1567
01:39:43,935 --> 01:39:47,056
No, we are not
revisiting your father's

1568
01:39:47,084 --> 01:39:49,924
colorful conversations.

1569
01:40:13,579 --> 01:40:15,373
Yeah, yeah.

1570
01:40:15,423 --> 01:40:17,139
Bring it a little closer, yeah.

1571
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:18,974
How's my hair?

1572
01:40:21,902 --> 01:40:25,719
We are five, four, three...

1573
01:40:26,035 --> 01:40:28,370
My fellow citizens,
at this hour,

1574
01:40:28,394 --> 01:40:30,403
American and coalition forces

1575
01:40:30,427 --> 01:40:33,806
are in the early stages
of military operations

1576
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:35,637
to disarm Iraq,

1577
01:40:35,661 --> 01:40:39,791
to free its people and to defend
the world from grave danger.

1578
01:40:40,216 --> 01:40:41,831
On my orders,

1579
01:40:41,855 --> 01:40:45,307
coalition forces have begun
striking selected targets

1580
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:46,809
of military importance

1581
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:51,095
to undermine Saddam Hussein's
ability to wage war.

1582
01:40:51,303 --> 01:40:54,296
These are opening stages
of what will be a broad

1583
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,425
and concerted campaign.

1584
01:40:57,038 --> 01:41:01,621
To all of the men and women of the United
States armed forces now in the Middle East,

1585
01:41:01,845 --> 01:41:06,584
the peace of a troubled world and
the hopes of an oppressed people...

1586
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:45,805
The statement from
The White House

1587
01:41:45,829 --> 01:41:49,273
President Bush regards this
as an historic moment.

1588
01:41:49,284 --> 01:41:54,202
The scenes on TV show, the thirst
of freedom is unquenchable.

1589
01:42:09,319 --> 01:42:13,809
USA! USA! USA! USA!

1590
01:42:19,602 --> 01:42:20,896
Hi.

1591
01:42:23,467 --> 01:42:26,537
Seems like they've been
shipping men and equipment

1592
01:42:26,561 --> 01:42:28,746
out of Afghanistan into Iraq.

1593
01:42:30,189 --> 01:42:32,556
And at the moment we're a little

1594
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:35,491
unsure of what's going on.

1595
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:40,951
I don't want you
to worry about me.

1596
01:42:48,447 --> 01:42:51,814
Major Combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

1597
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:53,405
In the Battle of Iraq

1598
01:42:53,423 --> 01:42:56,975
the United States and our
allies have prevailed.

1599
01:42:57,711 --> 01:43:01,418
We have concerns over Halliburton
KBR's billing practices.

1600
01:43:02,062 --> 01:43:05,536
As you know, the no-bid contracts
they received were quite sizable

1601
01:43:05,781 --> 01:43:06,985
- and now...
- Well...

1602
01:43:07,009 --> 01:43:10,144
- We're not concerned. Are we?
- Not at all.

1603
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:15,112
The Secretary of Defense and the Vice
President just said they're not concerned.

1604
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:18,181
Now can we please
talk about Iran?

1605
01:43:29,441 --> 01:43:34,307
To this day, Dick Cheney has never
apologized for this incident.

1606
01:43:34,331 --> 01:43:36,524
Jesus, Dick...

1607
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,279
But, someone else did.

1608
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:42,214
My family and I are deeply sorry

1609
01:43:42,217 --> 01:43:44,479
for all that Vice
President Cheney and his

1610
01:43:44,503 --> 01:43:47,121
family have had to go
through this past week.

1611
01:43:47,495 --> 01:43:50,484
We send our love
and respect to them.

1612
01:43:51,117 --> 01:43:54,004
And we hope that he will
continue to come to Texas

1613
01:43:54,836 --> 01:43:58,083
and seek the relaxation
that he deserves.

1614
01:43:59,008 --> 01:44:01,075
So, this...

1615
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:03,966
Joe Wilson,

1616
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,505
asshole,

1617
01:44:06,375 --> 01:44:09,497
is questioning our intelligence
in the New York Times?

1618
01:44:11,813 --> 01:44:13,427
What's his wife's name again?

1619
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:18,997
Valerie Plame. I confirmed it.
She's undercover CIA.

1620
01:44:19,824 --> 01:44:21,095
Leak it.

1621
01:44:37,268 --> 01:44:40,199
Okay, okay, like... they don't
care about their dogs, man.

1622
01:44:40,223 --> 01:44:42,128
I mean, they shoot them,
they let'em run wild...

1623
01:44:42,152 --> 01:44:44,051
What kind of a man
don't love a dog?

1624
01:44:44,075 --> 01:44:46,179
People in India love cows.

1625
01:44:46,203 --> 01:44:49,317
They would look at us and how we
treat cows and think the same thing.

1626
01:44:49,719 --> 01:44:50,946
With all due respect

1627
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:53,290
that sounds like some liberal
ass scratching bullshit.

1628
01:45:01,972 --> 01:45:03,266
Linda,

1629
01:45:07,003 --> 01:45:09,395
Look at this crap. Goddammit.

1630
01:45:09,419 --> 01:45:10,619
Hello Don.

1631
01:45:11,618 --> 01:45:13,846
That report says Zarqawi,

1632
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:16,622
the same fucking Zarqawi
we talked up for months,

1633
01:45:16,646 --> 01:45:19,210
is now leading a major
insurgency in Iraq.

1634
01:45:19,486 --> 01:45:22,946
And the implication is it's
because we talked him up!

1635
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:25,502
- Has POTUS seen this?
- No, no.

1636
01:45:25,526 --> 01:45:28,963
No I, I, intercepted it before
it got across the hallway.

1637
01:45:28,987 --> 01:45:32,742
- This is generated by an analyst.
- Get me Tenet.

1638
01:45:33,346 --> 01:45:34,851
This stops here.

1639
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:36,669
Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi

1640
01:45:36,693 --> 01:45:41,928
had taken his fame from Powell's UN speech
and turned it into his own new thing.

1641
01:45:43,104 --> 01:45:46,644
The Islamic State
of Iraq and Levant

1642
01:45:46,668 --> 01:45:48,047
or ISIS.

1643
01:45:48,379 --> 01:45:50,125
And because that intelligence

1644
01:45:50,149 --> 01:45:53,838
somehow found itself on the
bottom of a stack of papers,

1645
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:59,310
Zarqawi had a whole year to just
do whatever the hell he wanted.

1646
01:45:59,891 --> 01:46:01,826
And what he wanted

1647
01:46:02,547 --> 01:46:04,021
was carnage.

1648
01:46:05,375 --> 01:46:07,622
Shia versus Sunni,

1649
01:46:08,969 --> 01:46:11,208
the West versus Islam

1650
01:46:13,428 --> 01:46:15,777
and death versus life.

1651
01:46:16,968 --> 01:46:18,518
And on top of that

1652
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:23,388
the US forces couldn't find any
WMD's or nuclear programs in Iraq.

1653
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:25,608
Turns out that
Saddam and his son's

1654
01:46:25,632 --> 01:46:29,198
mostly liked cocaine and
American movies from the 80's.

1655
01:46:29,581 --> 01:46:32,479
Vice President Dick
Cheney is being sued

1656
01:46:32,503 --> 01:46:35,633
by Valerie Plame and her
husband Joseph Wilson.

1657
01:46:36,566 --> 01:46:39,238
The White House announced
four cabinet resignations

1658
01:46:39,262 --> 01:46:42,200
including that of Secretary
of State Colin Powell.

1659
01:46:42,224 --> 01:46:43,775
Dick,

1660
01:46:44,325 --> 01:46:46,832
Look, I hope there's no
hard feelings about us

1661
01:46:46,856 --> 01:46:50,037
investigating the no-bid Iraq
contract for Halliburton.

1662
01:46:50,061 --> 01:46:52,529
You know, I'm just doing my job.

1663
01:46:52,553 --> 01:46:54,097
Go fuck yourself.

1664
01:47:04,267 --> 01:47:07,975
Dick Cheney, emerges from the
dugout on the third base side.

1665
01:47:32,262 --> 01:47:34,123
Dick Cheney, a little
bit low on the outside.

1666
01:47:34,147 --> 01:47:37,946
Much of the intelligence from the
Iraq war now proven to be false.

1667
01:47:37,974 --> 01:47:42,139
There is a chorus of people calling for
Vice President Dick Cheney to step aside

1668
01:47:42,163 --> 01:47:43,908
and resign.

1669
01:47:44,321 --> 01:47:45,811
Go away!

1670
01:47:54,164 --> 01:47:57,575
I swear to God this whole
place is turning against me.

1671
01:48:01,116 --> 01:48:02,268
Where are you?

1672
01:48:02,292 --> 01:48:05,633
I'm in an empty office just trying
to get a clean phone line. Listen,

1673
01:48:06,356 --> 01:48:09,614
if we could just get an
air bombardment in Iraq,

1674
01:48:09,638 --> 01:48:11,158
I think it'll make a statement.

1675
01:48:11,294 --> 01:48:13,194
And it would give us
some political cover.

1676
01:48:13,218 --> 01:48:14,533
It's over Don.

1677
01:48:15,005 --> 01:48:16,549
What's that?

1678
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:18,018
What is?

1679
01:48:18,546 --> 01:48:21,461
It's over. The President
wants you to step down.

1680
01:48:21,485 --> 01:48:23,481
He appreciates your service.

1681
01:48:29,089 --> 01:48:30,360
Don,

1682
01:48:33,175 --> 01:48:34,448
Well...

1683
01:48:34,472 --> 01:48:38,781
Does Bush's kid want
me out, or do you?

1684
01:48:41,803 --> 01:48:45,941
- I can't win every fight Don.
- You are a little piece of shit.

1685
01:48:47,951 --> 01:48:51,276
Wow, how did you become
such a cold son of a bitch!

1686
01:48:51,654 --> 01:48:53,416
Sorry Don.

1687
01:48:53,925 --> 01:48:55,859
I really am.

1688
01:48:57,331 --> 01:48:59,929
Well, you know how
I know you're not?

1689
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,977
Cause I wouldn't be.

1690
01:49:08,858 --> 01:49:10,941
Think they'll prosecute us?

1691
01:49:15,219 --> 01:49:16,786
Okay then.

1692
01:49:19,629 --> 01:49:21,243
Okay then.

1693
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,913
I Barrack Hussein
Obama, do solemnly swear

1694
01:49:46,586 --> 01:49:51,270
that I will, execute the office of
President to the United States faithfully.

1695
01:49:58,232 --> 01:50:00,119
A few years later

1696
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:02,484
Dick's heart trouble
started up again.

1697
01:50:03,421 --> 01:50:05,613
With no donor available,

1698
01:50:05,687 --> 01:50:07,422
he finally found himself

1699
01:50:07,446 --> 01:50:08,993
at death's door.

1700
01:50:17,179 --> 01:50:20,238
I wish I had better news.

1701
01:50:20,435 --> 01:50:25,088
Your heart just isn't pumping enough
oxygen to keep your vital organs alive.

1702
01:50:26,897 --> 01:50:30,176
- Should I call for a Minister?
- No.

1703
01:50:30,444 --> 01:50:32,746
No. He's not going anywhere.

1704
01:50:34,369 --> 01:50:35,811
Okay then.

1705
01:50:39,221 --> 01:50:40,744
Dick Cheney,

1706
01:50:40,768 --> 01:50:44,311
you are not going
anywhere, do you hear me?

1707
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:47,389
- You are not going anywhere.
- This may be the...

1708
01:50:48,814 --> 01:50:51,632
one time I can't do

1709
01:50:52,674 --> 01:50:55,153
what your Mother says.
Girls...

1710
01:51:04,608 --> 01:51:07,051
- I love you Dad.
- I love you Mary.

1711
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,933
I love you Lizzy.

1712
01:51:22,444 --> 01:51:24,410
I love you girls.

1713
01:51:38,008 --> 01:51:40,727
So, Dick Cheney told his family

1714
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:42,438
that he was ready to die

1715
01:51:42,462 --> 01:51:44,590
and that he wasn't afraid.

1716
01:51:44,743 --> 01:51:47,623
Told them he had
lived a full life.

1717
01:51:48,155 --> 01:51:50,050
And he had zero regrets...

1718
01:52:41,617 --> 01:52:44,403
Vice President Cheney,
cross your arms please.

1719
01:52:44,992 --> 01:52:48,176
There you go, OK,
on count of three

1720
01:52:48,523 --> 01:52:50,325
One, two, three.

1721
01:52:53,498 --> 01:52:56,228
They say my heart could
give him another ten years.

1722
01:52:57,967 --> 01:53:01,652
Cheney doesn't like to refer
to it as someone else's heart,

1723
01:53:02,303 --> 01:53:05,074
he likes to refer to
it as his new heart.

1724
01:53:06,393 --> 01:53:09,414
Which, even though I'm
dead, I have to say

1725
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:12,320
it still makes me
feel pretty shitty.

1726
01:53:14,473 --> 01:53:15,735
And so,

1727
01:53:15,993 --> 01:53:19,787
when Liz decided to run for
one of Wyoming two senate seats

1728
01:53:19,811 --> 01:53:22,538
against Republican
incumbent Mike Enzi,

1729
01:53:23,081 --> 01:53:25,599
our Dick was right
there to hopefully

1730
01:53:25,623 --> 01:53:28,584
see the Cheney legacy
of power continue.

1731
01:53:28,608 --> 01:53:33,013
Are you aware Wyoming Senate candidate
Liz Cheney supports gay marriage?

1732
01:53:33,037 --> 01:53:35,561
Her sister is married
to another woman and Liz

1733
01:53:35,585 --> 01:53:38,429
Chenny refuses to support
a constitutional amendment

1734
01:53:38,453 --> 01:53:39,939
banning same sex marriage.

1735
01:53:39,963 --> 01:53:43,448
Instead she equivocates claiming
it's a state's right issue.

1736
01:53:43,472 --> 01:53:47,026
Don't you agree, Wyoming deserves
a Senator who believes marriage

1737
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:49,468
should be between
a man and a woman.

1738
01:53:49,495 --> 01:53:51,828
These calls went to
every house in Wyoming.

1739
01:53:52,612 --> 01:53:54,586
Every single house.

1740
01:53:57,401 --> 01:53:59,390
I will never win!

1741
01:54:01,158 --> 01:54:03,015
What are we gonna do?

1742
01:54:11,043 --> 01:54:13,144
We're joined here
today by Liz Cheney

1743
01:54:13,168 --> 01:54:14,762
who is running for the Senate

1744
01:54:14,786 --> 01:54:17,683
from the state of Wyoming.
According to one poll

1745
01:54:17,707 --> 01:54:20,365
she is behind by double digits.

1746
01:54:20,512 --> 01:54:21,585
Welcome.

1747
01:54:21,609 --> 01:54:24,195
Thank you for having me here Chris.
Great being with you. And may

1748
01:54:24,219 --> 01:54:26,880
I point out there are other
polls that have me much closer.

1749
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:31,261
Your opponent Senator Mike
Enzi claims that you support

1750
01:54:31,285 --> 01:54:33,079
gay marriage. In part

1751
01:54:33,082 --> 01:54:36,509
because you support your
gay sister Mary's union

1752
01:54:36,512 --> 01:54:39,185
with her wife. How
do you respond?

1753
01:54:39,209 --> 01:54:42,399
Let me be very, very clear

1754
01:54:43,466 --> 01:54:46,736
I do not support gay marriage.

1755
01:54:47,225 --> 01:54:51,027
I believe that marriage is
between a man and a woman.

1756
01:54:51,224 --> 01:54:54,137
But you've always claimed gay
marriage is a state issue.

1757
01:54:54,161 --> 01:54:57,760
Your opponent claims
this is an equivocation.

1758
01:54:59,114 --> 01:55:00,623
Cut me aorta.
Do you have the specimen bowl ready?

1759
01:55:00,647 --> 01:55:01,824
It's on the field.

1760
01:55:01,848 --> 01:55:03,029
Alright.
Here's the heart.

1761
01:55:03,053 --> 01:55:07,685
I know that Liz wouldn't have done any of
this if you and Dad didn't approve. So,

1762
01:55:08,587 --> 01:55:12,643
I can't believe you would do this.
I really thought there was a limit to...

1763
01:55:12,667 --> 01:55:14,587
No, now you're just
being hysterical.

1764
01:55:14,611 --> 01:55:17,899
I can't talk to you when you get this way.
You need to settle down.

1765
01:55:17,923 --> 01:55:19,221
Okay?

1766
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:21,225
You're being hysterical.

1767
01:56:53,335 --> 01:56:54,606
Dad?

1768
01:58:17,105 --> 01:58:19,180
Patient's heart rate is stable.

1769
01:58:19,987 --> 01:58:21,890
Blood pressure increasing.

1770
01:58:22,507 --> 01:58:24,733
I'm gonna notify the family.
What should I tell them?

1771
01:58:24,757 --> 01:58:27,231
- Tell them the patient's doing well.
- Okay.

1772
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,898
Mr. Vice President.

1773
01:59:01,922 --> 01:59:04,544
- This must be the right place.
- Yes.

1774
01:59:05,184 --> 01:59:06,800
- Hello Martha.
- Hi.

1775
01:59:06,824 --> 01:59:08,289
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

1776
01:59:08,394 --> 01:59:10,063
Sit right there.

1777
01:59:10,761 --> 01:59:12,387
So, um...

1778
01:59:12,411 --> 01:59:14,023
is it gonna be just

1779
01:59:14,047 --> 01:59:15,810
me on camera, or...

1780
01:59:15,941 --> 01:59:18,599
Primarily you. A'right,
cut back to me.

1781
01:59:18,623 --> 01:59:21,235
Eddie's got you on the “A” camera.
I'm just gonna bench.

1782
01:59:51,982 --> 01:59:53,416
Ready?

1783
01:59:55,755 --> 01:59:58,645
Two-thirds of Americans
say the Iraq war

1784
01:59:58,669 --> 02:00:00,709
is not worth fighting.

1785
02:00:00,733 --> 02:00:05,188
And their looking at the value gained
versus the cost of American lives.

1786
02:00:05,212 --> 02:00:06,871
And Iraqi lives.

1787
02:00:06,874 --> 02:00:08,176
So?

1788
02:00:09,601 --> 02:00:13,254
So... don't you care what
the American People think?

1789
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:15,919
No...

1790
02:00:16,087 --> 02:00:17,711
I think you

1791
02:00:17,735 --> 02:00:20,084
cannot be

1792
02:00:20,352 --> 02:00:22,615
blown off course.

1793
02:00:30,797 --> 02:00:32,661
I can feel

1794
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:35,309
your recriminations

1795
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,934
and your judgment.

1796
02:00:38,015 --> 02:00:40,504
And I am fine with it.

1797
02:00:42,717 --> 02:00:46,191
You want to be loved,
go be a movie star.

1798
02:00:48,014 --> 02:00:49,351
The world

1799
02:00:49,375 --> 02:00:51,038
is as you find it.

1800
02:00:51,062 --> 02:00:54,132
You gotta deal
with that reality.

1801
02:00:54,156 --> 02:00:56,733
And there are monsters
in this world.

1802
02:00:56,757 --> 02:00:58,200
We saw

1803
02:00:58,304 --> 02:01:00,684
three thousand

1804
02:01:00,836 --> 02:01:03,400
innocent people burned to death

1805
02:01:03,424 --> 02:01:06,966
by those monsters.
And yet, you object,

1806
02:01:07,759 --> 02:01:13,584
when I refuse to kiss those monsters
on the cheek and say, “pretty please.”

1807
02:01:14,163 --> 02:01:17,668
You answer me this,
what terrorist attack

1808
02:01:18,046 --> 02:01:20,149
would you have let go forward

1809
02:01:20,173 --> 02:01:24,917
so you wouldn't seem like
a mean and nasty fella?

1810
02:01:26,247 --> 02:01:29,002
I will not apologise

1811
02:01:30,014 --> 02:01:32,167
for keeping your families safe.

1812
02:01:32,736 --> 02:01:35,194
And I will not apologise

1813
02:01:35,668 --> 02:01:38,415
for doing what needed to be done

1814
02:01:39,644 --> 02:01:43,602
so that your loved ones can
sleep peacefully at night.

1815
02:01:50,659 --> 02:01:52,398
It has been my honor

1816
02:01:53,261 --> 02:01:54,875
to be your servant.

1817
02:01:56,825 --> 02:01:58,642
You chose me

1818
02:01:59,801 --> 02:02:01,345
and I did

1819
02:02:01,644 --> 02:02:03,266
what you asked.

1820
02:04:56,353 --> 02:04:59,627
Sorry to interrupt, but Mark wanted
to share something with everyone.

1821
02:04:59,651 --> 02:05:02,080
Something's been bothering
me this whole movie

1822
02:05:02,104 --> 02:05:03,957
and I just figured it out.

1823
02:05:03,981 --> 02:05:05,804
The whole thing is liberal.

1824
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:07,864
It's got a liberal bias.

1825
02:05:07,888 --> 02:05:10,446
Interesting. Does anyone
else feel that way?

1826
02:05:11,146 --> 02:05:14,022
One, two, three, four people.
Yeah, go ahead.

1827
02:05:14,046 --> 02:05:15,944
This is all facts.

1828
02:05:15,968 --> 02:05:18,627
Right? I mean, they
had to vet all this.

1829
02:05:18,739 --> 02:05:20,131
How does it make it what's...

1830
02:05:20,155 --> 02:05:23,020
You would say that libtard.

1831
02:05:23,247 --> 02:05:24,364
OK. I'm sorry.

1832
02:05:24,388 --> 02:05:27,014
So because I have the
ability to understand facts,

1833
02:05:27,038 --> 02:05:28,397
that makes me a liberal?

1834
02:05:28,421 --> 02:05:29,936
OK guys, let's just take it down.

1835
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,288
You probably like Killary!

1836
02:05:31,312 --> 02:05:33,524
Let's just take it down
a notch, or two. OK?

1837
02:05:33,548 --> 02:05:35,569
OK, first of all, Hillary's not President!

1838
02:05:35,593 --> 02:05:39,823
OK, the orange cheeto that
you hired is the President.

1839
02:05:39,847 --> 02:05:42,582
And he's ruining the country
that you claim to love!

1840
02:05:42,729 --> 02:05:44,093
You chicken shit!

1841
02:05:46,893 --> 02:05:49,160
Stop the fight! Knock it off!

1842
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:53,093
I can't wait to see the new FAST AND
THE FURIOUS MOVIE. That looks lit!
