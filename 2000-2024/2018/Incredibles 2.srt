00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,707
File 82-712:
Agent Rick Dicker interrogating.

3
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,621
State your name, please.

4
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,830
Uh... Tony.

5
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,510
Tony Rydinger.

6
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,801
Tell me about the incident.

7
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:51,897
<i>Well, there's this girl in my class.

8
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,745
<i>I saw her at the track meet.

9
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,372
- You're Violet, right?
- That's me.

10
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:59,277
<i>I sorta knew her, but she'd changed.
For better.

11
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,888
<i>She was more sure of herself, cool, cute.

12
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,622
<i>I asked her out for a movie.

13
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:05,411
- So, Friday?
- Friday.☻

14
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:07,495
<i>And then I went to watch the track meet.

15
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:11,979
<i>Not long after, this 'thing'
happened in the parking lot.

16
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:27,431
Behold, the Underminer!

17
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:32,864
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me.

18
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,396
<i>As if things aren't weird enough,
I look over and I see these boots.

19
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,514
- You two stay here.
- Wait, should we be doing this?

20
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:39,884
It is still illegal.

21
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:41,739
<i>It looked like super heroes.

22
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,778
- We're going to lose him.
- Oh, all right.

23
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:46,379
One of you control the perimeter,
keep the crowd back and safe.

24
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,620
The other watch after Jack-jack.

25
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,924
- But, I thought we were gonna...
- You heard your mother.

26
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:52,059
Trampoline me.

27
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,473
I call perimeter.

28
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:00,490
You're not going anywhere.
Come back here!

29
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:02,513
<i>I see my chance to get out of there.

30
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,888
<i>But, there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.

31
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:09,029
<i>The girl, she's upset, and
she throws down her mask,

32
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,396
and it's her!

33
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,232
Oh, Tony!

34
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:15,227
Hi. This isn't what you think it is.

35
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:18,483
<i>This was getting too freaky
I couldn't handle it and ran off.

36
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:20,428
I feel kinda bad about it.

37
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,422
Maybe I should've said, hi, or something.

38
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:25,433
It's not her fault superheroes are illegal.

39
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,485
And it's not like I don't like
strong girls,

40
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,745
I'm pretty secure, manhood-wise...
What is that?

41
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,557
Have you told anyone else about this?
Your parents?

42
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,753
No, they'd only think
I was high on something.

43
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,803
- I think you know what I mean.
- Sure, kid.

44
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:39,268
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker,

45
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm supposed to go out
with her Friday night.

46
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,595
Now things are just gonna be weird.

47
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,888
I wish I could forget I ever saw her
in that suit.

48
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,439
You will, kid.

49
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,618
You will.

50
00:10:56,382 --> 00:11:01,254
[INCREDIBLES 2]

51
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,573
Come on!

52
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:27,949
Consider yourselves undermined!

53
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,106
- Underminer, we meet again!
- Huh?

54
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,575
Oh, great! Now he's having
a* dead end.

55
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,347
Oh!

56
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:17,854
Incredible,...

57
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,049
meet Jackhammer!

58
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:23,093
(...)*

59
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,039
Bye-bye!

60
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,101
No no no...

61
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,889
Everyboy, stand back, okay?

62
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,577
Stay back!

63
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:01,397
Dash, can't you see we're babysitting.

64
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:09,629
I can't steer it, or stop it
and the Underminer's escaped.

65
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:13,004
We'll have to stop it...
Bob, the monorail!

66
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,871
Frozone! Yeah!

67
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:27,709
We have to stop this thing
before it gets to the overpass.

68
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,599
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings.

69
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:41,984
Hey, lady!

70
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:46,171
Thank you so much, young man.

71
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,608
Violet!

72
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:09,967
Stop!

73
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,936
Everybody stop!

74
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,066
- Heads up, dad!
- Dash!

75
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,472
- Violet, who's watching Jack-Jack?
- Dad's watching him.

76
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,679
Violet, here, you take him.

77
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,858
It's headed for City Hall.

78
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:04,726
Mom needs help.

79
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,965
They're out in public again.
This is our chance!

80
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,401
Follow them.
Follow Frozone!

81
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,229
Bob!
Help me with the boiler.

82
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,604
That should do it.

83
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,816
What are you kids doing?
Get outta here!

84
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,435
This thing's gonna blow!

85
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:55,092
There's no time!

86
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,569
We did it!

87
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:10,278
Freeze, supers!

88
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,194
Oh, what did we do!

89
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,457
Excuse me, Mr. 'Zone?

90
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:24,254
Sorry, but, I'm not really
supposed to be here.

91
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:27,170
Which seems wrong, doesn't it?

92
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:31,076
Perhaps you'd be interested in
changing that law?

93
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:36,241
<i>Superheroes, including Frozone,
Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl,

94
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,325
<i>caused further damage to the city.

95
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,581
<i>The Underminer remains at large.

96
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:43,581
- We didn't start this fight.
- Well, you didn't finish it, either!

97
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:46,499
- Dd you stop Underminer from
inflicting more damage? - No.

98
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,273
- Did you stop him from robbing
the banks? - No.

99
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,069
- Did you catch him?
- No.

100
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,848
The banks were insured, we
have infrastructure in place

101
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:55,225
to deal with these matters.

102
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,869
If you had simply done nothing,

103
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:59,950
everything would now be
proceeding in an orderly fashion.

104
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,309
You'd have preferred we do nothing?

105
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,286
Without a doubt.

106
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,660
You weren't much help.

107
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,724
You want out of the hole?

108
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,689
First you gotta put down
the shovel.

109
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,565
Uh, that went poorly.

110
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,704
Dad, this is probably
not the best time

111
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,002
to tell you about this, but,

112
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,197
something else happened today:

113
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:31,164
about a kid, and my mask.

114
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:49,230
Oh hey, Rick, Violet's friend,
a kid named Tony,

115
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:52,431
might have seen her in the outfit
without her mask.

116
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:55,821
- Talkative type?
- Dunno, last name is Rydinger.

117
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:59,260
Tony Rydinger. I'll check it out.

118
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,413
Bob, Helen.

119
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,632
A word if you don't mind.

120
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,825
The program's been shut down.

121
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,289
What?

122
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,445
Politicians don't understand
people who do good

123
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,221
simply because it's right.

124
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,249
Makes them nervous.

125
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,878
They've been gunning
for supers for years.

126
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:20,261
Today was all they needed.

127
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,360
Anyway, I'm done.

128
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:27,509
I'm afraid two more weeks in the motel
was the best I can do for you.

129
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,733
- It's ain't much.
- You've done plenty, Rick.

130
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,404
We won't forget it.

131
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,943
Well, it has been a great honor
working with you good people.

132
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:37,586
Thanks for everything. And good luck.

133
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,844
Yeah, you too.

134
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,401
Did you wash your hands?

135
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,067
With the soap?

136
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:03,201
Did you dry them?

137
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,694
What?! Is this all vegetables?

138
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:11,585
Who ordered all vegetables?

139
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,604
I did. They're good and
you're going to have some.

140
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:17,570
Are we going to talk about it?

141
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,696
- What?
- The elephant in the room.

142
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,374
- What elephant?
- I guess not, then.

143
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,577
- You're referring to today?
- Yeah! What's the deal with today?

144
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,052
We all make mistakes.

145
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:29,941
For example, you kids were
supposed to watch Jack-Jack.

146
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:33,070
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

147
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,391
We talked about this.

148
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,461
You're not old enough to decide
about these things.

149
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,606
- We are old enough to help out.
- Yeah!

150
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:40,358
Isn't that what you tell us, dad?

151
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:43,443
Yeah, well, help out can mean
many different things.

152
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:46,225
- But we're supposed to help
if there's trouble. - Yeah.

153
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,549
- Aren't you glad we helped today?
- I know, but...

154
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:51,615
- You said that you were proud of us.
- Well, I was, 'am'.

155
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,629
We wanna fight bad guys!

156
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,043
No, you don't!

157
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,294
You said things were different, now.

158
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,557
And they were 'on the island'.

159
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,560
But, I didn't mean that from now on...

160
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,761
So, now, we gotta go back to
never using our powers!

161
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,679
- It defines who I am!
- We're not saying...

162
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,058
- What?
- Some actor* said it.

163
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,488
Can we just eat the dinner,

164
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,538
while it's hot?

165
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:17,464
Did we do something wrong?
- Yes. - No.

166
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,900
We didn't do anything wrong.

167
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:22,265
Superheroes are illegal.

168
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,974
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

169
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:27,027
The law should be fair.
What are we teaching our kids?

170
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:30,098
- To respect the law.
- Even when the law is disrepectful?

171
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:34,237
If laws are unjust, there are laws to
change them. Otherwise it's chaos.

172
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:36,986
Which is exactly what we have!

173
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,328
- I just thought it was kinda cool.
- What was?

174
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:48,272
Fighting crime as a family.

175
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,082
It was cool.

176
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:52,910
But, it's over.

177
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,507
The world is what it is.
We have to adapt.

178
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:58,419
Are things bad?

179
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:00,201
Things are fine.

180
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,038
Can I be excused?

181
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:09,211
How much longer in the motel, dad?

182
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,505
Not much longer, sweetie.

183
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:22,224
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

184
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,665
- Maybe Dicker will find something.
- Dicker is gone, Bob.

185
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,782
Any thought we had about
being supers again, is fantasy.

186
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:30,466
One of us has gotta get a job.

187
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,910
One of us?

188
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:33,890
You did a long stint at Insuricare.

189
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:37,335
- Hated every minute of it.
- I know it was hard on you.

190
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,030
Maybe it's my turn in the
private sector and you take...

191
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,759
No, I'm doing this.

192
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:43,681
I need to do this.

193
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:47,536
- Do you know where suit and my ties are?
- Burned up when...

194
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:49,894
- the jet destroyed our house.
- the jet destroyed our house.

195
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,243
Yeah.

196
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,771
We can't count on anyone
else now, Bob. It's just us.

197
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:57,092
We can't wait for...

198
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:07,172
No lifeguard on duty.

199
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:08,811
Swim at your own risk.

200
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,492
Oh, where'd you go today?

201
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,508
I noticed you missed all the fun.

202
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,420
Don't be mad, because I know
when to leave a party.

203
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:19,355
I'm just as illegal as you guys, besides
I knew the cops would let you go.

204
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:22,585
- Yeah. It's quite a far fetched excuse*
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,392
I heard the program shut down.

206
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:28,820
- How much longer are you in this motel?
- 2 weeks.

207
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,790
And you know the offer still stands.

208
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:32,924
You're very generous,
but there's five of us.

209
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,715
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

210
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,457
The door's always open.

211
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,720
You know the news isn't all bad.

212
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,471
While you guys were
being detained,

213
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,097
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

214
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,544
Winston Deavor.

215
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:50,854
Wants to talk with me,
with you too, about hero stuff.

216
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,598
I checked him out, he's legit,

217
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,847
trained under Dicker,
he wants to meet.

218
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:56,941
Aw, jeez, more Superhero trouble?

219
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,403
We just came from the police
station Lucius.

220
00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:02,492
- When?
- Tonight, I'm going there, now.

221
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:04,936
You enjoy. I'm sittin' this one out.

222
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,641
He wants all three of us.

223
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:10,004
Honey, let's just, at least
hear what he has to say.

224
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:12,865
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

225
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,877
We go in our supersuits?

226
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:19,167
Yeah. Might wanna wear the old supersuits.

227
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:22,128
Got a feeling he's nostalgic.

228
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,417
Where are you going?

229
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:30,017
The fresh air is
especially good tonight.

230
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:33,228
- If Jack-Jack wakes up...
- I know the drill.

231
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:44,191
Your security badge.

232
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:46,129
Please this way.

233
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,430
Hey listen, you're my biggest fan.
What am I saying? I'm your biggest...

234
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,937
Shoot.

235
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:18,497
I love superheroes!

236
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:22,325
The powers, the costumes,
the mythic struggles!

237
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,375
Winston Deavor. You can call me Win.

238
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,158
Genuine pleasure to meet you.

239
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:27,604
Frozone!

240
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,393
- Elastigirl.
- Nice to meet you.

241
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:31,163
- Mr. Incredible.
- Hello.

Can't tell you what
a thrill this is.

251
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,179
- And this is ...
- Oh, hello there.

252
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,257
Superheroes, I'm so sorry.

253
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,374
...is my TARDY sister, Evelyn.

254
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,178
And I'm scolding myself, so,
you don't have to, Winston.

255
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,577
Spectacular.

256
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,333
My father was so proud

257
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:11,201
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

258
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:14,018
He used to call you,
the last line of defense.

259
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:16,057
He was your top supporter.

260
00:25:16,402 --> 00:25:18,597
He donated to superhero causes,

261
00:25:18,622 --> 00:25:21,616
he raised money for the
Dynaguy statue in Avery Park.

262
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:23,780
He got to know many supers, personally.

263
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:26,531
Even installed a phone
with direct lines

264
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:30,254
to Gazerbeam and Bionic
in case of emergencies.

265
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:32,707
He loved that.
Showed it off to everyone.

266
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,809
He was heartbroken when you were
all forced to go underground.

267
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:39,583
Father believed the world be
more dangerous without you.

268
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,024
But, you know how right he was.

269
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:45,642
There was a break-in.

270
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:50,693
My father called Gazerbeam,
the direct line.

271
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:52,751
No answer.

272
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:54,384
He called Bionic.

273
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:55,750
No answer.

274
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,642
Superheroes had just been made illegal.

275
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:03,151
The robbers discovered him
on the phone, and shot him.

276
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:05,500
So...

277
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:07,614
Must've been hard.

278
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:09,341
Especially for mother.

279
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:12,425
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

280
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,312
If superheroes had not been forced
underground it never would've happened.

281
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:19,862
Or dad could've taken mom to his safe-room
as soon as he knew there was trouble.

282
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:24,221
I disagree strongly, but we're
not going into it right now.

283
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:27,375
The point is nobody expected us

284
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:30,363
to be able to actually
run dad's company.

285
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:33,763
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator,

286
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:37,926
we threw ourselves into building
Devtech into what it is today.

287
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,621
A world-class
telecommunications company.

288
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:41,956
Bigger than ever.

289
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:45,206
and perfectly positioned to
make some wrong things, right.

290
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,199
Hence, this meeting.

291
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,797
Let me ask you something.

292
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,948
What is the main you were
all forced underground?

293
00:26:52,214 --> 00:26:54,479
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

294
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:56,855
Take today, for example,
with the Underminer.

295
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,496
Difficult situation: you were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

296
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:02,920
- Oh, tell me about it.
- I can't.

297
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,579
Because, I didn't see it.

298
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:07,391
Neither did anyone else.

299
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,878
So, when you fight bad guys, like today,

300
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:12,683
people don't see the fight,
or what led up to it.

301
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,945
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

302
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:17,674
They see the destruction,
and they see you.

303
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:21,845
So if we want change people's
perceptions about superheroes,

304
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:25,769
we need YOU to share YOUR
perceptions with the world.

305
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:28,128
- How do we do that?
- With cameras.

306
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:31,778
<i>we need YOU to share YOUR
perceptions with the world.

307
00:27:31,803 --> 00:27:33,012
<i>How do we do that?

308
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:36,461
We embed tiny cameras like those
into your super suit.

309
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:37,855
Wow, so small!

310
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:41,008
- And the picture is outstanding.
- Thanks, I designed it myself.

311
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:45,477
We've got resources, lobbyists, world-wide
connections and, very important,

312
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,763
- Insurance.
- Insurance is key.

313
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:50,243
All we need now,
are the superest superheroes.

314
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,960
It means you three.

315
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:55,680
Come on, help me make
all supers legal again!

316
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,219
This sounds great!

317
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,616
Let's get this going,
what's my first assignment?

318
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:02,790
That enthusiasm is golden.
Hold onto it.

319
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:06,541
But for our first move, well,
Elastigirl is our best play.

320
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:10,168
- Better than me?
- Ahem!

321
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:15,422
I mean, she's good.
She's, really, a credit to her, but...

322
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,721
you know ... You know.

323
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:20,098
With great respect,
let's not test the whole,

324
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:24,439
'insurance-will-pay-for-everything' idea,
on the first go 'round, OK?

325
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:27,887
Wait a minute, you're saying what?
I'm messy?

326
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:30,422
Well, Evelyn did a cost-benefit
analysis comparing

327
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:33,867
all your last 5 years of crime-fighting,
before going underground.

328
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:36,175
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

329
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:38,174
Oh, it's not a fair comparison.

330
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,884
Heavyweight problems,
need heavyweight solutions.

331
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,711
Of course! We're gonna solve
all kinds of problems together.

332
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:49,344
After a perfect launch with Elastigirl!

333
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:53,646
- So, what do you say?
- What do I say?

334
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:57,650
I don't know.

335
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,702
What do you mean,
you don't know?

336
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:02,146
A few hours ago, you were saying
it was over.

337
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,189
That being a superhero
was a fantasy.

338
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,597
Now, you get the offer of a lifetime
and you don't know?

339
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:11,025
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids.

340
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,184
- So do I.
- From jail, Bob!

341
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,783
How do you do that?
By turning down the chance

342
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,228
to change the law that's forcing
them to hide what they are?

343
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:21,867
They haven't decided what they are!
They're still kids.

344
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:24,514
Kids with powers,
which makes them supers.

345
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,872
Whether they decide to use
those powers, or not.

346
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:30,421
- This will benefit them.
- Look, it's not a good time to be away.

347
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:32,235
Dashiel's having trouble
with homework,

348
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,320
Violet's worried about her first
date with that boy she likes, Tony.

349
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:38,774
- And Jack-Jack ...
- Jack-Jack? What's wrong with him?

350
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,569
OK, nothing's wrong with Jack-Jack.

351
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:43,139
But, even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

352
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,258
- I'm just not sure I can leave.
- Of course you can leave.

353
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,292
You've got to, so that I...

354
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,034
WE could be supers, again.

355
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,386
So, our kids can have that choice.

356
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,652
- So you can have that choice.
- All right, yes!

357
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:57,727
So I can have that choice.

358
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,419
And I would do a great job.

359
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:04,316
Regardless of what those dumb
pie charts say, or whatever.

360
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,644
But they want you.

361
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,201
And you'll do a great...

362
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,232
job.

363
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,119
Sure.

364
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:18,455
That was excruciating to watch.

365
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,922
I can't lie to you,
it's nice to be wanted.

366
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:24,697
- Flattery, you know. But...
- What's the choice?

367
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,543
1: do this right, get well paid,
we're out of the motel,

368
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:30,688
and things get better for all supers,
including our kids.

369
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,716
Or, 2: I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

370
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,416
You know it's crazy, right?

371
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:40,496
To help my family, I gotta leave it.
To fix the law, I gotta break it.

372
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:42,624
- You'll be great.
- I know I will.

373
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:45,835
- But what about you? We have kids.
- I'll watch the kids. No problem.

374
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,638
- Easy.
- Easy, huh? You're adorable.

375
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:51,695
Well, if there is a problem, I'll drop
this thing and come right back.

376
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,187
You won't need to.
I got it, you go. Do this thing.

377
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:57,422
Do it so,...

378
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:59,662
I can do it better.

379
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:05,332
- Deavor, here.
- This is Elastigirl, I'm in.

380
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,496
Mr. Deavor, it's wonderful,
but, it's too generous.

381
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:14,402
Nonsense. It's the least we could do.

382
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:17,776
We're partners, now!
Can't have my partners living in a motel.

383
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,211
Wh-whose is the house?

384
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:21,947
It's my house. I have several.

385
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,857
I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.

386
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,076
- I don't know what to say.
- How about, thanks?

387
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,501
This is our new house?!

388
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:34,058
It's OK, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

389
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:37,510
- Yeah. - This is homey.
- I mean, look at this place.

390
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,027
Deavor bought it from an
eccentric billionaire

391
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:42,567
who liked to come and go,
without being seen,

392
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,778
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

393
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,747
Good thing we won't stand out.

394
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,793
Wouldn't wanna attract any
unecessary attention.

395
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:51,809
It's got a big yard!

396
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:55,844
- Isn't... Isn't it a bit much?
- Near a forest!

397
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:59,889
- Would you rather be at the motel?
- And a pool!

398
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:02,337
What exactly is mom's new job?

399
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,789
The important thing is,
we're out of the motel.

400
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,405
I like mom's new job!

401
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,296

410
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:47,878

- No.

lot about me, you don't know.

That's fine. Stay calm, or
I'll turn this bus right 'round.

- But, I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:03,662
They are, for now.

445
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,510

She's not break...

She's an advocate for superheroes.
It's a new job.

So, mom is going out, illegally,

be illegal.

It's going the wrong direction.

511
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:58,919
We're going the wrong way.

512
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:00,701
I'm going after it.

513
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:08,569
This thing's really moving!
100 and climbing.

514
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:10,429
How much track is built?

515
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,964
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

516
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:22,317
Nobody can shut this thing down?

517
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:24,130
<i>They've tried, no go.</i>

518
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,671
Is that Elastigirl?

519
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:32,399
Look out!

520
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:37,537
- Override!
- They're locked out of the system.

521
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,907
- What about a fail-safe.
<i>- Not enough time.</i>

522
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:51,351
<i>- Someone's calling?</i>
- Switch it over.

523
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:54,480
<i>Hey, mom, I can't find my high socks,
and dad can't find them either</i>

524
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,923
<i>but he won't call you and ask, so, I am.</i>

525
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:58,344
<i>You're not calling your mother!</i>

526
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,287
Dash, honey, can't talk right now.
But look under your bed, OK?

527
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:03,890
- How much time?
<i>- Approximately 2 minutes.</i>

528
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,262
<i>There's a shortcut
through the corridor up ahead.</i>

529
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,148
I dunno if I can stay with him.

530
00:40:40,913 --> 00:40:42,639
Come on!

531
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:26,363
What the heck?

532
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:30,241
Everybody alright? Is anybody injured?
You alright?

533
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:35,497
Your story better be good!

534
00:42:36,574 --> 00:42:38,724
Hey? HEY?

535
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:40,695
What happened?

536
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:44,730
[Welcome back, Elastigirl]
.

537
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:48,230
[Welcome back, Elastigirl]
[Screenslaver]

538
00:43:13,898 --> 00:43:17,351
- Honey, why are you?...
- Don't say anything.

539
00:43:22,196 --> 00:43:25,290
- It's dad. Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

540
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,331
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Tony didn't even call?

541
00:43:29,402 --> 00:43:32,927
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Oh honey... - Dad!

542
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:38,131
If you want me to feel better,
then, leave me alone. Please.

543
00:43:38,924 --> 00:43:40,070
Huh?

544
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,758
<i>...only my kid brother's son.</i>

545
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:43,507
<i>Today is his first birthday.</i>

546
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:46,558
<i>He's not as mature, as you, Roy.</i>

547
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:49,376
<i>'Cause you're a wonderful policeman.</i>

548
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:51,322
<i>This is a holdup.</i>

549
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:54,623
<i>Right, get your hands up,
turn your back.</i>

550
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:58,504
<i>Put your hands behind your head
and keep'em there. Don't move.</i>

551
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,168
<i>Drop it! And get over there.</i>

552
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,966
<i>Watch the door.</i>

553
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:06,422
<i>Do you think I'm kiddin'?</i>

554
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,671
<i>Now.</i>

555
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,982
<i>- I said, now!
- I got'im!</i>

556
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:17,748
<i>Come on!</i>

557
00:45:56,216 --> 00:45:58,345
No, no, no, no, no!

558
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,760
No!

559
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,385
No, no!

560
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,931
No, no, no! NO!

561
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:11,517
No, no, no, no! NO!

562
00:46:19,203 --> 00:46:22,322
You have POWERS!

563
00:46:22,494 --> 00:46:24,094
Yeah, baby!

564
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,175
And there's not a scratch
on you!

565
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,068
How'd you go through the locked door?
Are those your powers?

566
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:34,454
You can multiply like rabbits and
go right through anything solid.

567
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,079
Oh, my God!

568
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:49,464
- Hello.
- Hey, honey. You weren't gonna call me?

569
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:52,539
Hi, hey, no. I mean, yes, yeah.

570
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,839
I just didn't wanna... wait.

571
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,715
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

572
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,431
Sounds like I just woke you up.

573
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:01,381
No, no, it's just, Jack-Jack.

574
00:47:01,406 --> 00:47:04,020
He's had an accident? I knew it.
I'm coming home, right now.

575
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:06,024
- I never should've...
- No, no, no. No accidents.

576
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:07,657
Stay there and
finish your mission.

577
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:11,316
And you never, should... What?!
You don't think I can do this?

578
00:47:11,357 --> 00:47:13,357
Sorry, I misspoke.

579
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,309
Do you need me to come back?

580
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:18,175
No, no, no, I've got this.
Everything's great.

581
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:20,269
What happened with Jack-Jack?

582
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,019
- Nothing, he's in excellent health.
- Well, that's good.

583
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:29,500
How was Violet's date?
That was tonight, right?

584
00:47:29,525 --> 00:47:32,143
Oh, yeah. Yes. Good.

585
00:47:32,507 --> 00:47:34,232
All, fine, and good.

586
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:36,543
And Jack-Jack went down,
with no trouble?

587
00:47:36,568 --> 00:47:38,371
Fine, yes, no trouble.

588
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:40,043
And Dash got his homework done?

589
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:43,576
- All done. - So, things haven't spiraled
out of control, the moment I left?

590
00:47:43,616 --> 00:47:48,013
Amazing as it may seem, it has
been quite uneventful, in fact.

591
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,703
How about you?

592
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,871
I saved a runaway train!

593
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,758
It was so great! The mayor was there
to cut the ribbon on this new train.

594
00:47:57,783 --> 00:48:00,243
<i>...opening ceremony,
Elastigirl pursued the train</i>

595
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:02,261
<i>and was able to
successfully activate...</i>

596
00:48:02,286 --> 00:48:04,705
Bla-bla-bla, he says a few
words, cut the ribbon

597
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,668
and the train starts pulling
out of the station, backwards, then...

598
00:48:07,693 --> 00:48:10,714
<i>- the track of the brand new hover-train
- ...the train malfunctioned

599
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:13,389
<i>- ...due to Elastigirl...
- ...came to an almost...

600
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:15,882
<i>...superhero. Elastigirl...
- Elastigirl... - Elastigirl...

601
00:48:15,907 --> 00:48:18,864
BOOM! NO CASUALTIES!

602
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,876
<i>...specialized motorbike...

603
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:26,556
<i>And I go after it, I'm tellin'ya
honey, it was a saga!

604
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:30,782
That's fantastic honey!
And on your first night!

605
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,767
I'm so proud of you. Really.

606
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:35,590
<i>I'm proud of you, honey.</i>

607
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:38,512
I know you wanna get out there
and you will soon, OK?

608
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:40,389
You will be amazing!

609
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:42,933
I couldn't have done this,
if you hadn't taken over so well.

610
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:44,952
<i>Thanks for handling everything.

611
00:48:44,977 --> 00:48:46,494
It's nothing.

612
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:49,187
I love you, honey. I'll be back soon.

613
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:52,419
<i>- Sweet dreams.</i>
- Sweet dreams, honey.

614
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,752
...I can't explain...

615
00:49:08,827 --> 00:49:11,085
Hey, dad, it's okay.

616
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,189
I'll just wait for mom to get home.

617
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:17,067
As if she could... ah...

618
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:19,958
I can do math.

619
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:31,811
Oh, that's not a good sign...

620
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:35,949
Weak command!

621
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:39,624
Am I a substitute parent?

622
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:45,241
It's not my fault, they changed math.

623
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:55,056
Hey, buddy. Come on.

624
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,976
I think I understad your
math assignment.

625
00:49:58,054 --> 00:50:01,521
We still have some time to
finish it before your test.

626
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:05,297
First, you wanna put all the
numbers by themselves....

627
00:50:06,898 --> 00:50:10,386
And now that means the
plus becomes a minus and the minus....

628
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:13,321
You got it? Yeah, baby!

629
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:29,398
Oh. Hello.

630
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,552
We're in a new house.

631
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:34,515
I did write my address
on your locker,

632
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:36,548
in permanent ink.

633
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:38,711
Oh, is that, what that is?

634
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:40,465
Did you forget?

635
00:50:40,698 --> 00:50:42,723
Forget? ... What?

636
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:46,203
That's funny.

637
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:50,247
Funny for honey.

638
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:53,690
Oh, was it the weird outfit?

639
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:57,177
'Cause there's a reason!
I'm in a drama class,

640
00:50:57,202 --> 00:50:59,662
and they just wanna
do Shakespeare,

641
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:02,490
but they were like, try to
make it relevant for the kids.

642
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,051
So, like, superheroes.
Kids love superheroes. - Yeah, yeah.

643
00:51:05,076 --> 00:51:06,491
You wanna wear one
kind of tights

644
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:08,572
and then they're like, no,
wear these other kind.

645
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:11,314
Do... Do I know you?

646
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:21,661
<i>Many say your speech today
is critical.

647
00:51:21,686 --> 00:51:24,372
<i>Both sides just want the
best for their people.

648
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:27,571
<i>We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.

649
00:51:27,946 --> 00:51:29,827
I haven't done this in a while.

650
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:32,336
This is good.
The train gives us momentum.

651
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:35,757
Just go out there and be your
charming self and capitalize.

652
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:38,416
Ms. Elastigirl, they're ready for you.

653
00:51:38,446 --> 00:51:40,639
Hey, spread your legs.

654
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:44,937
- Thank you Chad.
- My pleasure, Ambassador.

655
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,160
<i>Gloria.

656
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:49,284
Madam Ambassador, hello!

657
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:53,056
You are Elastigirl! This is why,
now, I'm shaking your hands.

658
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,679
Oh, I was so sad when
you went ungerground.

659
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:59,030
I'm glad to see you back!
In your shiny outfit.

660
00:51:59,088 --> 00:52:02,826
- That means so much coming from you.
Good luck with your speech.

661
00:52:02,861 --> 00:52:07,068
- Bring lasting peace.
- I will, when you defeat evil!

662
00:52:07,517 --> 00:52:08,776
Okay.

663
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:10,486
Three, two ...

664
00:52:11,302 --> 00:52:14,250
For over 15 years, superheroes
have been in hiding.

665
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:17,613
Forced into it by a society,
no longer willing to support them.

666
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:21,797
That may soon be changing due to a
growing movement to bring supers back.

667
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,123
Here, fresh on the heels of her own
heroic save of a runaway train

668
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:28,877
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

669
00:52:28,902 --> 00:52:32,648
- Welcome. - Hello, Chad. - Well all the
polls are going in your direction.

670
00:52:32,673 --> 00:52:33,860
That's true. Things are good.

671
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:35,118
Hello.

672
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,867
Uh, hello.

673
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:39,505
Do I have your attention?

674
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,808
Yes, Chad?

675
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,806
Of course, I do,
I'm appearing on your screen.

676
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,798
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

677
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:48,902
Screens are everywhere.

678
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,607
We are controlled by screens.

679
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:56,813
And screens are controlled by me:

680
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:58,715
<i>SCREENSLAVER!</i>

681
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,408
- Hey!
<i>- I control this broadcast.</i>

682
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:04,501
<i>And this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.</i>

683
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:06,646
- What's wrong with him?
- The signal's been hijacked!

684
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:08,857
- I'll check it out.
- Don't look at any monitors.

685
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,385
<i>I could hijack the ambassador's
aerocade,</i>

686
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:15,533
<i>while it's still airborne,
right, Elastigirl?</i>

687
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:19,858
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

688
00:53:20,078 --> 00:53:21,625
There.

689
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:34,601
- What's going on?
- Where's Elastigirl?

690
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,354
Which one?

691
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:47,900
- What are you doing here?
- The Ambassador is in danger.

692
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:50,639
Which chopper is she in?
Look out!

693
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:53,661
Follow them and get me close!

694
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:59,635
Get out of the sky. Touchdown safely!

695
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:11,304
Stand down, it's Elastigirl.

696
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:14,054
Stay in your seat, Ma'am!

697
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,294
We're under attack!

698
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:24,762
Quick go.
Protect the Ambassador!

699
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:31,343
- Open the door!
- Do as she says!

700
00:54:32,952 --> 00:54:36,104
- Can you all, swim?
- Yeah. - Yeah. - No.

701
00:54:57,036 --> 00:55:00,130
We're gonna have to switch sides, hang on!

702
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:09,371
Are you all right, Ma'am?

703
00:55:09,396 --> 00:55:11,109
I'm perfectly fine.

704
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,780
Boys are dirt and superheroes suck.

705
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:26,989
- Good morning.
- He took one look at me in that suit,

706
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:30,844
and decided to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

707
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,937
Oh, he's protecting himself.

708
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,681
If he really see you,
it's best that he forgets.

709
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:37,459
It's better for you, too.

710
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:39,732
I can't tell you how many
memories

711
00:55:39,757 --> 00:55:42,550
Dicker's had to erase,
over the years, when...

712
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,417
someone figured out your
mother's or my identity.

713
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,431
It was Dicker!

714
00:55:48,456 --> 00:55:50,675
- You told him about Tony!
- Honey.

715
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,733
You had me erased from
Tony's mind!

716
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:08,675
I hate superheroes!

717
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,591
And I renounce them!

718
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:20,750
I renounce th...!

719
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,913
Is she having adolescence?

720
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:32,342
<i>a new report out
today shows that</i>

721
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:34,026
<i>when it comes to decision making</i>

722
00:56:34,051 --> 00:56:37,395
<i>people have more trust in a monkey
throwing darts than Congress.</i>

723
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,637
What's going on Tommy? The President?

724
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:41,652
They're here in support.

725
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,185
Support? Support for what?

726
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:46,411
In support of you.

727
00:56:48,924 --> 00:56:51,104
Hello, all of you!

728
00:56:51,502 --> 00:56:54,004
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

729
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:56,728
Oh, my goodnes, thanks so much!

730
00:56:57,056 --> 00:56:59,720
Hello. What's your sign say?

731
00:57:00,162 --> 00:57:02,139
[SCREENSLAVER IS STILL AT IT*]

732
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:09,252
'Sup?

733
00:57:09,277 --> 00:57:11,465
Oh, what do you know, Ellen Wood!

734
00:57:11,507 --> 00:57:14,674
Oh, now you wanna return my calls
about superheroes, huh?

735
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,697
Oh, I'll have to call YOU back.
Oh, that felt good!

736
00:57:17,722 --> 00:57:19,305
Felicia, hold my calls, please.

737
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,893
Hey, it's working!

738
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:24,381
Hey, the ambassador made a big
speech about superheroes, today.

739
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:27,786
Turns out, saving someone's life makes
a good impression on them. Who knew?

740
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,844
I'm getting calls from
all over the world.

741
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:32,543
Media awareness is up 72%

742
00:57:32,568 --> 00:57:34,943
The push for superhero
legalization's becoming

743
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:36,630
a world-wide movement!

744
00:57:36,677 --> 00:57:38,564
I have big plans for our next move.

745
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,423
We're gonna have a summit at sea.

746
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:42,794
We'll use our ship we'll gather
leaders

747
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:44,900
and supers from all over
the world.

748
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:47,177
That's great. I'm happy.

749
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:48,963
I'm happy the numbers are up.

750
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:52,083
I'm happy the ambassador is
pro-superheroes.

751
00:57:52,129 --> 00:57:53,844
And I'm happy, you're happy.

752
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,019
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

753
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:59,851
Because I didn't get him.
Screenslaver's still out there.

754
00:57:59,885 --> 00:58:02,877
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

755
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:06,706
He's gonna want more and as long
as he gets to play, he wins!

756
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:10,167
One thing I've learned in business:
smell the flowers.

757
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:11,737
They don't bloom that often.

758
00:58:11,762 --> 00:58:14,695
What do you want on your tombstone,
"She worried a lot"?

759
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:17,771
All right, stop talking,
show her.

760
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,789
Wow, ah...

761
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:33,279
Wow! Elastigirl, there you are.

762
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:35,710
- Hello.
- I-I didn't... wow!

763
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:38,421
Ahem! (Get yourself together, Karen)

764
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,735
Hi, my superhero name is Voyd,

765
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:44,915
I just wanna thank you, for like,
for being you.

766
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:48,441
And I'd... really like to say... Okay.

767
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,324
What I can do, um, is this.

768
00:58:57,532 --> 00:58:59,453
Yeah, that is impressive

769
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:01,803
Very interdimensional.

770
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:03,946
I felt like an outcast. Before.

771
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:07,693
But now, with you being... you.

772
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:09,227
I really...

773
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:11,831
Yay, me.

774
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,495
I flew them in, from all over.

775
00:59:14,505 --> 00:59:16,470
They've all been in hiding.

776
00:59:16,495 --> 00:59:18,775
With powers, secret identities,
and

777
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,087
names they've given themselves.

778
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,594
I'm Screech, a pleasure.

779
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:26,566
I always considered you as
the gold standard for the superhero.

780
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:28,988
Well, thanks. You're too nice.

781
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,876
- I am called Brick.
- Nice to meet you, Brick.

782
00:59:32,962 --> 00:59:35,626
- Where are you from?
- Winsconsin.

783
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,062
Oh, Elastigirl. I assume your powers are...

784
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:41,536
You know, zapping things electrically,

785
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:43,870
charging things, bolts of lightning,
that kinda stuff.

786
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:45,302
Name's Reflux.

787
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:48,101
Medical condition, or superpower?
You decide.

788
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:51,487
That's a little line I say
just to put people at ease.

789
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:53,323
- By the way: big fan.
- Oh, no, no.

790
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,010
Reflux, love it.

791
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:02,181
Yeah, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

792
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,086
Ow!

793
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:09,253
Well, I'm beat.

794
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:11,314
Congratulations. Big day.

795
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:13,841
Good night ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

796
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:15,196
G'night.

797
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,277
Must be nice for you,
being out front,

798
01:00:17,302 --> 01:00:19,560
- after all this time?
- Out front?

799
01:00:19,585 --> 01:00:22,697
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days.

800
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:25,984
And, even then, you were kind of
in Mr. Incredible's shadow.

801
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:27,602
Nah, I beg to differ.

802
01:00:27,627 --> 01:00:31,472
I'm not saying you weren't big.
And you were and ARE a superstar.

803
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:34,534
But, you have the stage
to yourself, now.

804
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,759
People have to pay attention, now.

805
01:00:36,784 --> 01:00:38,737
You mean it's a man's
world and all that bull?

806
01:00:38,762 --> 01:00:39,925
What world do you live in?

807
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:42,929
- Your brother runs Devtech.
- I don't want his job.

808
01:00:42,954 --> 01:00:45,673
I invent. He sells.

809
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,845
I ask you, which of us has
the greater influence?

810
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,916
Which side of me are you asking?
The believer or the cynic?

811
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:54,646
- The cynic.
- Would say, selling is more important

812
01:00:54,671 --> 01:00:57,105
because the best sellers
have the most buyers.

813
01:00:57,145 --> 01:01:00,652
Doesn't matter what you're selling.
It only matters what people buy.

814
01:01:00,677 --> 01:01:04,386
This is true. If I discovered
the origin of the universe,

815
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,448
my brother would find a way
to market it as a...

816
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,214
foot massager.

817
01:01:11,164 --> 01:01:12,873
So, what would the believer say?

818
01:01:12,898 --> 01:01:15,781
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

819
01:01:15,814 --> 01:01:17,814
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

820
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,719
and impose your will
on the status quo.

821
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:21,327
- Sounds like my brother.
- What?

822
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:23,750
- You sound like my brother.
- Well, he's not wrong.

823
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:25,984
There's an art to
getting a reaction.

824
01:01:26,009 --> 01:01:27,876
- Oh, I know how to get him!
- My brother?

825
01:01:27,907 --> 01:01:30,116
Which... No! Screenslaver!

826
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:33,608
You're tech savvy; I need to lock
onto his signal and trace its origin.

827
01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:36,348
How fast can you slap something
together and meet me at the airport?

828
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:38,364
- Airport?
- Need to get out of town, pronto.

829
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:40,335
I can get your contraption
together by 5:am.

830
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,297
We need to get on TV. Chad!

831
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:45,172
I'll get my brother to set up an exclusive
with him tonight on the newscast

832
01:01:45,203 --> 01:01:47,637
- Finish our interview by phone!
- Promote the hell out of it!

833
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,075
Independent from screen slavery!

834
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,273
'Chad Tonight. BOOM!'

835
01:01:55,396 --> 01:01:56,935
- Dicker.
- Yeah, hey Rick.

836
01:01:56,982 --> 01:01:59,756
You remember that kid I mentioned
to you, Tony Rydinger?

837
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:01,550
Mind-wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

838
01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:05,339
Well, you also wiped out a Friday
night date, my daughter had with him.

839
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:07,586
In fact, you wiped out my daughter.

840
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:09,859
Oops. Not an exact science, Bob

841
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:11,801
Rick, you gotta help me here.

842
01:02:11,836 --> 01:02:14,795
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

843
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,225
I gotta fix this.

844
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,389
What do you know about Tony?

845
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,879
Er... Not much. Seems like a good kid.

846
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:26,019
Popular, plays sports, music.
Parents own the 'Happy Platter'.

847
01:02:26,091 --> 01:02:28,113
Kid works there, part-time.

848
01:02:28,138 --> 01:02:30,412
Happy Platter?

849
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:37,315
Why did we drive all the way across
town for the 'Happy Platter'?

850
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,846
We'd like a booth, over there,
near the Philodendron.

851
01:02:40,871 --> 01:02:43,563
Good, right, near the Philodendron?

852
01:02:45,312 --> 01:02:48,281
This platter doesn't look
all that happy, to me.

853
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,287
It looks bored.

854
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,399
The Bored Platter!

855
01:02:52,424 --> 01:02:55,484
I thought Vi would want a change
of pace from drive-in food.

856
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:57,510
I like drive-in food.

857
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,463
Does this mean, vegetables?

858
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:03,338
A balanced diet needs vegetables,
kiddo. Get ussed to it.

859
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:05,638
Good evening, everyone.

860
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:07,976
- OH!
- Gross!

861
01:03:08,024 --> 01:03:10,442
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, it's OK.

862
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:13,854
- Let me help you. - That's fine sir.
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

863
01:03:13,898 --> 01:03:16,695
Normally she doesn't ever drink like that.

864
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,822
OK, would you like
some water, sir?

865
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:20,744
Yes. Yes, I would.

866
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:23,699
This is my daughter, whom,
you must know, right?

867
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,699
- Hello. - (Violet).
- Hello, Violet.

868
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:30,448
- Hey, Vi, say hi to...
- Don't push it, dad!

869
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,220
I'm Dash, her little brother.

870
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:33,697
Hello.

871
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:37,096
Really good water, very refreshing!

872
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:41,128
- Mineral water*?
- I don't know, sir, I think it's tap.

873
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:44,347
- Ah! Very delicious.
- Excellent tap.

874
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:48,288
Nice to meet you.

875
01:03:48,313 --> 01:03:49,874
Where'd she go?

876
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:52,231
To find a good place to be angry?

877
01:03:53,106 --> 01:03:57,024
Tonight, we go now to a special
remote interview with Elastigirl.

878
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:59,414
<i>How you feeling, Chad? You doing all right?</i>

879
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:01,946
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

880
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:03,975
I have no memory of the event.

881
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,500
<i>I gotta tell you, it's pretty strange
to see a recording of yourself</i>

882
01:04:07,525 --> 01:04:10,141
<i>the night before, and
have no recollection</i>

883
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:13,987
<i>I don't think anyyone needs to worry,
we've taken many precautions tonight.</i>

884
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,032
<i>- Where are you, right now?</i>
- On a case.

885
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:18,369
In a secure undisclosed location.

886
01:04:18,394 --> 01:04:19,992
<i>I want to talk about you,</i>

887
01:04:20,017 --> 01:04:22,534
starting with your save
of a runaway train.

888
01:04:22,644 --> 01:04:26,183
<i>Here's an exclusive, unedited
clip, from your own suit-cam.</i>

889
01:04:26,285 --> 01:04:27,854
Roll the clip.

890
01:04:27,945 --> 01:04:29,934
<i>This thing's really moving.</i>

891
01:04:30,189 --> 01:04:32,915
<i>100 and climbing.
How much track is built?</i>

892
01:04:32,948 --> 01:04:35,032
<i>Around 25 miles.</i>

893
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:40,453
Screenslaver interrupts this program
for an important announcement.

894
01:04:40,488 --> 01:04:42,501
I'll be damned, she knew!

895
01:04:42,526 --> 01:04:44,234
Let's see if her gadget works.

896
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:47,171
- Don't bother wathing the rest...
- Gotcha!

897
01:04:47,204 --> 01:04:50,115
<i>Elastigirl doesn't save the day.</i>

898
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:53,098
<i>She only postpones her defeat.</i>

899
01:04:53,282 --> 01:04:55,257
<i>And whie she postpones
her defeat,</i>

900
01:04:55,289 --> 01:04:58,166
<i>you eat chips and watch her
confront problems</i>

901
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:00,851
<i>that you are too lazy to deal with.</i>

902
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,979
<i>Superheroes are part of
your brainless desire</i>

903
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:07,016
<i>to replace true experiences
with stimulation.</i>

904
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:10,781
<i>You don't talk,
you watch talk-shows.</i>

905
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:14,186
<i>You have craving to watch
game shows.</i>

906
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:19,607
<i>Travel, relationships, risk,
every meaningful experience</i>

907
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:23,691
<i>must be packaged and
delivered to you to watch at a distance*</i>

908
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:27,791
<i>So that you can remain ever
sheltered, ever passive,</i>

909
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:30,289
<i>ever ravenous consumers</i>

910
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:33,672
<i>who can't bring themseves

911
01:05:33,922 --> 01:05:37,398
<i>break a sweat and participate
in life.</i>

912
01:05:37,842 --> 01:05:40,699
<i>You want superheroes
to protect you,</i>

913
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,635
<i>and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process,</i>

914
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:48,189
<i>while you tell yourselves
you're being looked after,</i>

915
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:53,428
<i>that your futures are being
served and your rights are being upheld.</i>

916
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:56,485
<i>So that the system keeps
you *stealing from you,</i>

917
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,500
<i>smiling at you all the while.</i>

918
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:02,779
<i>Go ahead, send your supers
to stop me.</i>

919
01:06:02,881 --> 01:06:07,184
<i>Grab your snacks, watch your
screens and see what happens.</i>

920
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:10,587
<i>You are no longer in control,</i>

921
01:06:10,636 --> 01:06:12,776
<i>I am.</i>

922
01:07:53,701 --> 01:07:55,427
Find anything?

923
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:47,867
Sorry!

924
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,828
What happened?

925
01:09:20,853 --> 01:09:23,860
What happened, is,
you destroyed my evidence!

926
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:25,879
What's going on? What'd I do?

927
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:30,035
- What'd you guys do to me?
- That's right punk, blame the system!

928
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:33,807
Your tracker worked like a charm,
Evelyn, you're a genius.

929
01:09:33,832 --> 01:09:37,619
Aw, shucks! I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

930
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:39,308
<i>The New Urban city council...

931
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:44,345
Dad, we're doing fractions and
'dennis-mals' and percentages

932
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,594
- I don't get'em.
- Aren't you ...

933
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:49,051
- Didn't we get all caught up?
- Yeah, we were caught up

934
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,644
And now, we're doing fractions
and percentages and 'demisals'

935
01:09:52,669 --> 01:09:53,796
Decimals

936
01:09:53,828 --> 01:09:56,434
<i>...of the Incredibile, or the supercar</i>

937
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:59,404
once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.

938
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:02,535
It's the kind of thing you buy,
when you have everything else.

939
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,198
They said it was beyond repair.

940
01:10:04,222 --> 01:10:05,908
<i>Hey, it was in perfect condition.</i>

941
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,868
You used to have that?

942
01:10:07,879 --> 01:10:09,520
They said it was destroyed.

943
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:13,447
Once thought lost or destroyed the
famous car turned up at private auction.

944
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:14,940
They said it was...

945
01:10:14,971 --> 01:10:17,011
That's my car!

946
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:27,271
(...stupid car's features...)

947
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,203
This car's just loaded
with amazing gadgets.

948
01:10:30,228 --> 01:10:32,490
- Care to demonstrate?
- I'd love to, but,

949
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:35,443
we haven't figured out how
to make them work, yet.

950
01:10:36,639 --> 01:10:39,170
Wow! You do that?!

951
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,326
Huh?

952
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:44,776
What are you doing? This is not a toy!

953
01:10:44,896 --> 01:10:46,516
That's a rocket launcher!

954
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,399
NO WAY?!
Which one launches the rocket?

955
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:49,843
Hey, this is not your car.

956
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:51,209
It's not your car, either.

957
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:52,865
It is, so! It's the Incredibile.

958
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,069
- Well why's that guy have it?
- He shouldn't.

959
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,778
Launch the rocket!
Launch the rocket!

960
01:10:56,803 --> 01:10:57,905
LAUNCH! THE! ROCKET!!

961
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:59,429
We're not launching anything.

962
01:10:59,454 --> 01:11:02,610
Do you think I want an angry rich
guy coming after me right now,

963
01:11:02,635 --> 01:11:04,426
when I'm trying to not to...

964
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:06,000
distract...

965
01:11:06,532 --> 01:11:08,129
your mother

966
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:11,680
Hm... rich guy!...

967
01:11:13,552 --> 01:11:18,041
So you're not gonna steal your car
back from the rich guy?

968
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:34,965
- Jack-Jack has the powers?
- Well, yeah, but...

969
01:11:35,059 --> 01:11:36,767
- You knew about this?
- Yeah.

970
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,534
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I dunno.

971
01:11:38,559 --> 01:11:40,811
We're your kids.
We need to know these things.

972
01:11:40,836 --> 01:11:42,833
- You tell mom?
- No! - Why not?

973
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:45,304
Your mother is not
what we're talking about.

974
01:11:45,329 --> 01:11:47,945
- Why not tell mom?
- Because, I didn't want... - What?

975
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,045
- Because, it's not the time.
- Come on, man. - Why?

976
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,779
- Because ...
- It's, so, uncool.

977
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:53,908
Because I'm fomulating OK?

978
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:56,630
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing.

979
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,031
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend

980
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:01,746
and keeping the baby from
turning into a flaming monster.

981
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:03,664
How do I do it?

982
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:08,688
By rolling with the punches, baby!
I ain't doing no crash landing, OK? *

983
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:13,938
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible,
not Mr. Softsoap, or Mr. Mediocre Guy.

984
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:17,133
Mr. Incredible!

985
01:12:17,949 --> 01:12:19,849
We should call Lucius.

986
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:25,444
No! I can handle it.
There's no way I'm gonna...

987
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:38,407
I'm gonna call Lucius.

988
01:12:41,564 --> 01:12:44,328
Looks normal to me.
When did this start happening?

989
01:12:44,353 --> 01:12:47,219
- Well, since Helen got the job.
- I assume she knows.

990
01:12:47,244 --> 01:12:49,515
Are you kidding?
I can't tell her about this.

991
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,155
Not while she's doing hero work.

992
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,318
Mama.

993
01:12:52,343 --> 01:12:54,607
<i>Girls, come on. Leave the saving
of the world to the men?!</i>

994
01:12:54,632 --> 01:12:56,228
I don't think so!

995
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:59,710
I've got to succeed so she can succeed.

996
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,817
So we... can succeed.

997
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:03,863
I get it, Bob. I get it.

998
01:13:03,888 --> 01:13:05,459
When was the last time you slept?

999
01:13:05,484 --> 01:13:07,253
Who keeps track of that?

1000
01:13:07,278 --> 01:13:11,106
Besides, he's a baby, I can handle it.
I got this handled.

1001
01:13:11,146 --> 01:13:13,310
So... you're good then?

1002
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:16,104
You got everything under control,
right?

1003
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,364
What the?!...

1004
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:22,752
Okay, Jack-Jack want a cookie?

1005
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,701
Yum-yum, cookie. Jack-Jack...

1006
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:27,407
Yum-yum, cookie.

1007
01:13:27,432 --> 01:13:28,654
Cookie.

1008
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:31,422
- You're not?... -  Cookie.
- Oh my God!

1009
01:13:32,139 --> 01:13:33,795
Woah, daddy!

1010
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,851
So, he can hear you...

1011
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:39,135
from the other dimension. Yeah.

1012
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:41,217
That, is creepy. And that's not good.

1013
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:44,263
Not like our other kids. No, it is not!

1014
01:13:44,423 --> 01:13:46,529
Full power: totally random.

1015
01:13:46,592 --> 01:13:49,356
So, now he's, what ... *physically there?

1016
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,405
Yeah, well, you'd think so, right?

1017
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,657
Obviously, I can't keep giving him cookies!

1018
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:57,019
But if I stop...

1019
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:05,066
No! No biting, dad. Don't bite!

1020
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:12,828
OK.

1021
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:17,080
I think I just need a little bit of
me time.

1022
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:18,705
Then I'll be good to go.

1023
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,991
Oh, you need more than me time, Bob.

1024
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:24,293
You need major life realignment
on a number of levels.

1025
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:26,693
Starting with baby super-freak,
here!

1026
01:14:26,757 --> 01:14:30,678
You need some solid
outside the box thinking.

1027
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:40,856
Galbaki?

1028
01:14:40,895 --> 01:14:44,886
Elastigirl's supersuit is by Galbaki?!

1029
01:14:45,056 --> 01:14:47,050
Explain yourself.

1030
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:52,469
Bob Parr, son, you're
worse than I thought*.

1031
01:14:52,494 --> 01:14:55,621
It's the baby. I brought the baby.

1032
01:14:57,372 --> 01:14:59,275
Highly unusual.

1033
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,930
You look ghastly Robert Parr.

1034
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,384
I broke my daughter.

1035
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:14,269
They keep changing math.

1036
01:15:14,386 --> 01:15:17,605
I need AA batteries, but I got AAAs

1037
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:20,255
So, I still need AA batteries.

1038
01:15:20,506 --> 01:15:24,567
Put one red thing with a load of
whites, now everything's pink.

1039
01:15:24,622 --> 01:15:26,042
There's not many eggs....

1040
01:15:26,091 --> 01:15:29,589
Done properly, parenting is a heroic act.

1041
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:31,552
Done 'properly'.

1042
01:15:31,585 --> 01:15:34,645
And fortunately,
it has never affected me.

1043
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:38,831
But, you do not come to me for
eggs and batteries, Robert.

1044
01:15:38,843 --> 01:15:42,786
I designing hero wear, and
Elastigirl must have a new suit!

1045
01:15:43,322 --> 01:15:45,224
Actually it's Jack-Jack.

1046
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:48,484
You also wish a new suit for the baby?

1047
01:15:48,509 --> 01:15:51,706
I would hardly classify this
as an emergency.

1048
01:15:51,902 --> 01:15:55,033
Well, it's a special case,
worth studying.

1049
01:15:55,095 --> 01:15:57,451
If I could just leave him
with you for a while.

1050
01:15:57,476 --> 01:15:59,607
Leave him?! Here?!

1051
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,453
I'm not a baby person, Robert.

1052
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:05,383
I have no baby facilties.
I am an artist.

1053
01:16:05,413 --> 01:16:08,631
I do not involve myself in
the prosaic day-to-day....

1054
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:20,417
Did *you see this, Robert?

1055
01:16:33,753 --> 01:16:35,366
My God!

1056
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:37,247
Yes.

1057
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:40,218
Of course you can leave the baby
overnight, after all filling in for Helen

1058
01:16:40,243 --> 01:16:41,746
is challenging and
you are very tired

1059
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:44,617
and the other children need you and miss
you and need you close to them.

1060
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:46,681
Auntie Edna will take
care of everything

1061
01:16:46,706 --> 01:16:49,640
so drive carefully and good bye,
I enjoy our visits.

1062
01:16:51,786 --> 01:16:53,995
'Auntie' Edna?

1063
01:16:57,924 --> 01:17:00,190
Attention, attention.

1064
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,854
I wanna thank everyone
that came out, tonight,

1065
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:07,796
in support of superheroes and
bringing them back into society.

1066
01:17:07,898 --> 01:17:09,423
You all made it happen.

1067
01:17:09,448 --> 01:17:11,641
And the need for this has
been made crystal clear

1068
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,547
in recent days,
with bad actors, like

1069
01:17:13,572 --> 01:17:16,516
the self proclaimed Screenslaver,
threatening our peace.

1070
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,619
His reign was short, huh?

1071
01:17:18,653 --> 01:17:21,393
I think* to this woman, a great super,

1072
01:17:21,418 --> 01:17:23,386
You love her, you missed her.

1073
01:17:23,411 --> 01:17:26,167
Welcome back, Elastigirl!

1074
01:17:27,177 --> 01:17:29,366
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1075
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:31,273
Come on, get up here.

1076
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:34,665
I want you to have this.

1077
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:36,868
A memento.

1078
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:40,542
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
*I never would've guessed it.

1079
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:42,615
I'm forever in your debt.

1080
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,013
And thanks to all of you. Your
*pressure changed all the right minds.

1081
01:17:47,268 --> 01:17:49,834
We made amazing headway
in a very short time,

1082
01:17:49,859 --> 01:17:52,728
which leads me to an
important announcement.

1083
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:55,484
Just now, at a world-wide summit,

1084
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:58,910
leaders from more than a hundred
of the world's top countries

1085
01:17:58,935 --> 01:18:02,588
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1086
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:06,041
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1087
01:18:06,066 --> 01:18:08,762
from all over the planet
on our boat the Everjust,

1088
01:18:08,787 --> 01:18:11,965
for a televised signing
ceremony at sea!

1089
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:16,356
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1090
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,681
Hey, hi... me again...

1091
01:18:23,874 --> 01:18:27,255
Um, there's ... something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1092
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,993
How do you balance the superhero
stuff with *your life?

1093
01:18:31,236 --> 01:18:33,283
*I'd really like to know.

1094
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:39,722
Uhuh... Oh, would you, please,
excuse me for a moment?

1095
01:18:40,489 --> 01:18:43,631
Yeah, OK, see you later.* Good talk.

1096
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,650
- Hey, Vi.
- Hey.

1097
01:19:07,644 --> 01:19:10,279
- Where's Jack-Jack?
- E's taking him for a little bit.

1098
01:19:10,303 --> 01:19:12,591
- Edna is babysitting?
- Yeah.

1099
01:19:12,616 --> 01:19:14,709
And you're OK with this?

1100
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,059
Yeah, I dunno why.

1101
01:19:19,495 --> 01:19:22,296
I wanted to say something to you.

1102
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:24,991
Sorry about Tony.

1103
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:28,568
I didn't think about
Dicker erasing his memory,

1104
01:19:28,593 --> 01:19:31,693
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice

1105
01:19:31,718 --> 01:19:33,224
you never made.

1106
01:19:33,249 --> 01:19:35,882
It's not fair, I know.

1107
01:19:36,102 --> 01:19:39,649
And then I made it worse at the
restaurant by trying to ...

1108
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,642
Anyway, anyway...

1109
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:43,430
I'm sorry.

1110
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:46,589
I'm used to knowing what
the right thing to do is.

1111
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,062
But now, I'm not sure, anymore.

1112
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:52,343
I just wanna be...

1113
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,354
a good dad.

1114
01:19:59,807 --> 01:20:02,078
You're not good,...

1115
01:20:03,825 --> 01:20:05,780
you're super.

1116
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:17,881
Are superheroes allowed to
drink on duty?

1117
01:20:17,906 --> 01:20:20,857
I am, definitely, not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1118
01:20:20,893 --> 01:20:22,513
I know, I should be up there,

1119
01:20:22,538 --> 01:20:25,610
but, I had to step away from
the *primp and glitter, you know?

1120
01:20:25,663 --> 01:20:28,739
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

1121
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,731
What are you getting away from?

1122
01:20:30,768 --> 01:20:33,751
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1123
01:20:33,782 --> 01:20:35,076
But you love him.

1124
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:37,108
You two *are this company.
Yin and Yang.

1125
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,662
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people:

1126
01:20:39,687 --> 01:20:43,674
pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1127
01:20:44,021 --> 01:20:46,083
I never know what people want.

1128
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:48,143
What do you think they want?

1129
01:20:48,406 --> 01:20:52,602
Ease. People will trade quality
for ease, every time.

1130
01:20:52,627 --> 01:20:55,670
It may be crap, but,
hey, it's convenient!

1131
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:57,439
Yeah, kinda like this case.

1132
01:20:57,464 --> 01:21:00,490
- What the Screenslaver?
- Yeah, something doesn't seem right.

1133
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:02,266
It was too easy.

1134
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,336
That was too easy?

1135
01:21:05,618 --> 01:21:07,243
- Finally.
- What?

1136
01:21:07,268 --> 01:21:08,774
What is that?

1137
01:21:09,021 --> 01:21:13,373
It's one of the Screenslaver's
monitors it's tuned into my suit-cam.

1138
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,207
- Isn't the suit-cam closed circuit?
- Yes.

1139
01:21:18,232 --> 01:21:20,823
Then, how come the Screenslaver has it?

1140
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,672
Maybe he hacked it?

1141
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:25,339
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that,

1142
01:21:25,364 --> 01:21:27,806
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1143
01:21:27,858 --> 01:21:29,826
Maybe he wanted you to find him.

1144
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,457
He wanted to get caught?

1145
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:34,546
- He wanted you to win.
- That makes no sense.

1146
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:38,676
He's a brilliant guy. If he's smart enough
to conceive of technology like this,

1147
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:41,510
he's smart enough think of
something to do with it.

1148
01:21:41,535 --> 01:21:43,503
The guy we put put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1149
01:21:43,528 --> 01:21:45,818
So? Einstein was a patent clerk! He...

1150
01:21:45,843 --> 01:21:47,347
Look, you won.

1151
01:21:47,372 --> 01:21:49,271
- You've got the guy...
- Wait!

1152
01:21:49,296 --> 01:21:51,958
All Screenslaver needs to do,
to hypnotize someone,

1153
01:21:51,983 --> 01:21:54,232
is get a screen in front of their eyes.

1154
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:58,120
But, what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

1155
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:04,929
What if... the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy

1156
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:08,569
but, he was controlled by the
screens built into his glasses...?

1157
01:22:09,048 --> 01:22:11,140
You are good.

1158
01:22:14,991 --> 01:22:17,081
<i>Look, a robot. It's taking off.</i>

1159
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:18,932
<i>I'm not getting a reading, yet.</i>

1160
01:22:18,957 --> 01:22:20,550
<i>- Fire?
- Now.</i>

1161
01:22:22,902 --> 01:22:24,271
<i>More power.</i>

1162
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:25,812
<i>I hope it works dad.</i>

1163
01:22:27,418 --> 01:22:30,009
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1164
01:22:30,185 --> 01:22:32,474
17 hours!

1165
01:22:32,856 --> 01:22:34,403
How do you feel?

1166
01:22:35,324 --> 01:22:36,888
Super.

1167
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:38,825
<i>-You got it, dad!
- Hurray!</i>

1168
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:43,781
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you watching Jack-Jack for me, E.

1169
01:22:43,806 --> 01:22:46,775
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1170
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,746
Don't ask me to do it again, darling,
my rates are far too high.

1171
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:53,556
I am joking, Robert,
I enjoyed the assignment.

1172
01:22:53,581 --> 01:22:57,009
He is bright and I am stimuated,
we deserve each other.

1173
01:22:57,608 --> 01:22:59,629
You child is a polymorph.

1174
01:22:59,716 --> 01:23:02,369
Like all babies, he has
enormous potential.

1175
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:05,845
It's not unknown for supers to have
more than one power, when young,

1176
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:07,990
but, this little one has many.

1177
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:11,897
Yes, you have many powers?

1178
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,797
Ba ba ba...

1179
01:23:25,676 --> 01:23:29,208
I understand your lack of sleep
is *confusing you, Robert.

1180
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:32,536
Babies can be anything,
and your child is no exception.

1181
01:23:32,601 --> 01:23:35,312
Shows unlimited potential, Robert.

1182
01:23:35,413 --> 01:23:38,156
That's why I worked in a creative fever.

1183
01:23:38,202 --> 01:23:40,552
Auntie E has stayed
up all night,

1184
01:23:40,577 --> 01:23:43,598
making sure you look
fabulous in your *uniform

1185
01:23:43,635 --> 01:23:45,792
What're...
You're putting him in...

1186
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:47,233
In the chamber, Robert.

1187
01:23:47,258 --> 01:23:50,286
He is part of the demonstration
and will be fine.

1188
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,769
Your challenge is to manage
a baby who has

1189
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,282
multiple powers and no control
over them, yes?

1190
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,579
Well, uh...That sums it up.

1191
01:23:58,604 --> 01:24:02,665
I often work to music, and I noticed
the baby responds to it as well.

1192
01:24:02,946 --> 01:24:05,201
Specifically Mozart.

1193
01:24:05,547 --> 01:24:10,644
I blended kevlar with *carbide for
durability under duress and comfort also.

1194
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:14,377
Interwoven with these fabrics,
are a mesh of tiny sensors

1195
01:24:14,402 --> 01:24:17,380
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1196
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:20,448
Oh Lord ! What's he... what is he doing?

1197
01:24:20,475 --> 01:24:23,371
Well, it's Mozart, Robert!
Can you blame him?

1198
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:25,683
The important thing is
that the suit and tracker

1199
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:27,824
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1200
01:24:27,871 --> 01:24:30,596
Oh no! Cookies, I gotta get cookies!

1201
01:24:30,621 --> 01:24:34,847
You do not need cookies, as I learned
quite painfully, last night.

1202
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:39,588
Any solution involving cookies will
inevitably result in the demon phase.

1203
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,518
"Combustion imminent"?
What does that mean?

1204
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:49,055
It means fire, Robert.
Though, the suit has ...*

1205
01:24:49,134 --> 01:24:51,671
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames,

1206
01:24:51,702 --> 01:24:54,241
before he tests the
sprinkler system.

1207
01:24:56,588 --> 01:25:00,100
Flame retardant
blackberry-lavender foam.

1208
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,816
Effective, edible and delicious .

1209
01:25:02,942 --> 01:25:04,697
Oh, *what's going on in here*

1210
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,471
That, is useful.

1211
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:11,091
Although I have doubtlessly ecceded your
expectations for a SINGLE night's work.

1212
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:14,645
the suit and device contain a few
more features we need to discuss.

1213
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:17,233
Thanks again, E., for everything.

1214
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:19,872
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, pish-posh, darling.

1215
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:21,820
Your bill will be covered by my fee

1216
01:25:21,845 --> 01:25:24,706
for being Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl
and Frozone's

1217
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:27,642
exclusive designer throughout
the known universe

1218
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:29,127
and until the end of time.

1219
01:25:29,152 --> 01:25:31,248
But babysitting this one,

1220
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:33,487
I do for free, darling.

1221
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:54,246
I would resist the temptation
to stretch,

1222
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:57,481
the temperature around you
is well below freezing.

1223
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:00,267
Try to stretch and you'll break.

1224
01:26:00,307 --> 01:26:02,586
So you're the Screenslaver?

1225
01:26:02,817 --> 01:26:05,175
Yes... And no.

1226
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:09,848
Let's say, I created the character
and pre-recorded the messages.

1227
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,402
Does Winston know?

1228
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:14,274
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not!

1229
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,537
Can you imagine what
'Mr. Free Enterprise'

1230
01:26:16,562 --> 01:26:18,567
would do with my
hypnosis technology?

1231
01:26:18,592 --> 01:26:20,167
Worse than what you're doing?

1232
01:26:20,192 --> 01:26:24,352
Hey, I'm using the technology
to destroy people's trust in it.

1233
01:26:24,461 --> 01:26:26,592
Like I'm using superheroes.

1234
01:26:26,647 --> 01:26:29,443
- Who did I put in jail?
- Pizza delivery guy.

1235
01:26:29,468 --> 01:26:31,388
Seemed the right height, build.

1236
01:26:31,413 --> 01:26:33,423
He gave you a pretty good fight.

1237
01:26:33,456 --> 01:26:37,126
I should say I gave you
a pretty good fight, through him.

1238
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:39,793
But, it doesn't bother you that
an innocent man is in jail?

1239
01:26:39,818 --> 01:26:41,339
Eh, he was surly.

1240
01:26:41,645 --> 01:26:43,191
And the pizza was cold.

1241
01:26:43,263 --> 01:26:44,714
I counted on you.

1242
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:46,637
That's why you failed.

1243
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:49,254
- What?
- Why would you count on me?

1244
01:26:49,285 --> 01:26:51,072
Because I built you a bike?

1245
01:26:51,142 --> 01:26:54,332
Because my brother knows the words
to your theme song?

1246
01:26:54,357 --> 01:26:55,827
We don't know each other.

1247
01:26:55,852 --> 01:26:57,636
But you can count on me, anyway.

1248
01:26:57,661 --> 01:26:59,571
I'm supposed to, aren't I?

1249
01:26:59,596 --> 01:27:02,934
Because you have some strange
abilities and a shiny costume,

1250
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:07,414
the rest of us are supposed to put
our lives into your gloved hands.

1251
01:27:07,599 --> 01:27:09,760
That's what my father believed.

1252
01:27:10,088 --> 01:27:13,703
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1253
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:16,278
Begged my father to use
the safe room.

1254
01:27:16,473 --> 01:27:20,699
But, father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1255
01:27:20,844 --> 01:27:23,604
He died. Pointlessly.

1256
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:25,643
Stupidly.

1257
01:27:25,668 --> 01:27:28,292
Waiting for heroes to save the day.

1258
01:27:28,317 --> 01:27:31,690
- But, why would?... Your brother...
- IS A CHILD!

1259
01:27:31,902 --> 01:27:35,867
He remembers the time when we had
parents AND superheroes.

1260
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:39,555
So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.

1261
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:43,422
Mommy and Daddy went away,
because supers went away.

1262
01:27:43,447 --> 01:27:48,007
Our sweet parents were fools to put
their lives in anybody else's hands.

1263
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:50,522
Superheroes keep us weak!

1264
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,910
Are you gonna kill me?

1265
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:55,129
Nah.

1266
01:27:56,386 --> 01:27:57,924
Using you, is better.

1267
01:27:57,949 --> 01:28:00,994
You're gonna help me
make supers illegal,

1268
01:28:01,315 --> 01:28:03,040
forever.

1269
01:28:10,175 --> 01:28:12,613
- Ready? - Ga.
- Laser eyes.

1270
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:15,180
- Stop!
- Wow!

1271
01:28:15,205 --> 01:28:16,622
Yay, Jack-Jack!

1272
01:28:16,647 --> 01:28:18,219
That's not all. Watch this.

1273
01:28:18,244 --> 01:28:20,271
Jack-Jack, *blaster ready?

1274
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,382
- No way?!
- Crazy cool!

1275
01:28:27,453 --> 01:28:30,281
- I get to fire him now!
- Hey, it's demonstration!

1276
01:28:30,362 --> 01:28:33,619
No firing the baby around the house,
you understand?

1277
01:28:33,644 --> 01:28:35,983
This is potentially dangerous.

1278
01:28:36,207 --> 01:28:39,382
We're trying to teach him
to control his powers, OK?

1279
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:41,468
Stop! See the screen?

1280
01:28:42,593 --> 01:28:43,835
He vanished!

1281
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,425
That's really cool!

1282
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:48,721
OK, good. Use the thing.
See that's called a readout.

1283
01:28:48,746 --> 01:28:52,463
Click. See the readout, dimensions?
See the shape? That's the room.

1284
01:28:52,488 --> 01:28:55,406
See where he is in relation?
So, where is he?

1285
01:28:56,841 --> 01:28:58,360
There!

1286
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:01,189
OK, come out. Num-num, cookie?

1287
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:05,194
- Yayy! - Jack-Jack!
- Really cool!

1288
01:29:12,767 --> 01:29:14,694
- Hello?
- Elastigirl's in trouble.

1289
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,193
What? What happened to her?

1290
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:19,318
Sorry, to tell you on the phone.
Meet me on our ship at Devtech.

1291
01:29:19,343 --> 01:29:21,841
The ship at Devtech.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1292
01:29:21,866 --> 01:29:23,801
<i>What's with the ship at Devtech?</i>

1293
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:27,183
Lucius? Bob. Helen's in trouble.
I need someone to watch the kids.

1294
01:29:27,215 --> 01:29:30,469
- Suit up, it might get weird.
- I'll be there, ASAP, 15 tops.

1295
01:29:30,494 --> 01:29:32,775
<i>Where are you going, ASAP?</i>

1296
01:29:33,459 --> 01:29:35,295
<i>And wearing that suit?</i>

1297
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,220
I gotta go. Be home soon.
Lucius will be here, sooner.

1298
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:40,461
No firing the baby
around the house, OK?

1299
01:29:40,486 --> 01:29:42,336
What's at the ship at Devtech?

1300
01:29:42,361 --> 01:29:44,680
And why are you in your super suit?

1301
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:58,167
Is that mom's super suit?

1302
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,198
She may need it. You never know.

1303
01:30:00,223 --> 01:30:01,721
What's going on?

1304
01:30:01,816 --> 01:30:05,681
I dunno. But dad called Lucius
AFTER getting a call about mom,

1305
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:07,181
and then LEFT.

1306
01:30:07,206 --> 01:30:09,035
I thought you renounced superheroes.

1307
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,878
Yeah, well, I renounce my
renunciation!

1308
01:30:11,965 --> 01:30:13,753
Put that on.

1309
01:30:24,622 --> 01:30:27,213
Hello there, little fella.

1310
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,676
Hello.

1311
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:30,308
You kids aren't safe.

1312
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:34,176
- The Deavors sent us to take you...
- Well, isn't that redundant!

1313
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,915
The Deavors just sent ME here
to guard the house.

1314
01:30:39,595 --> 01:30:41,821
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1315
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:44,187
I get it, managerial screw-up.

1316
01:30:44,212 --> 01:30:47,204
Tell Winston, I have this*.
You understand, Ms? ...

1317
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:48,611
Voyd.

1318
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:50,556
Ms. Voyd1

1319
01:30:51,426 --> 01:30:53,099
*I'll see-ya.

1320
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:03,375
But, the thing is,

1321
01:31:03,556 --> 01:31:06,072
he wants us to bring you, too.

1322
01:31:06,263 --> 01:31:07,716
Hey!

1323
01:31:08,724 --> 01:31:10,996
That isn't gonna hold them long.

1324
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:13,059
Dash, grab the baby!

1325
01:31:15,808 --> 01:31:17,339
Spread out!

1326
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:24,117
Dash, we gotta get to my car!

1327
01:31:33,525 --> 01:31:35,850
What? What's going on?

1328
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,450
Little fella?

1329
01:31:55,838 --> 01:31:57,434
It worked!

1330
01:32:02,561 --> 01:32:04,837
Incredibile, windows down!

1331
01:32:05,959 --> 01:32:07,637
Climb in!

1332
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:17,777
Incredibile, *transport is under your
protection, now. Say your names.

1333
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:20,642
- Violet Parr.
- Dashiell Robert Parr.

1334
01:32:25,065 --> 01:32:26,960
- Lucius!
- Harrgh!

1335
01:32:27,001 --> 01:32:28,784
Incredibile, escape!

1336
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,917
- Fill me in.
- Good news and bad news.

1337
01:32:38,942 --> 01:32:42,178
We found her, she seems physically
fine but she's had an ecounter

1338
01:32:42,203 --> 01:32:44,815
with Screenslaver and she's
acting kinda strange.

1339
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,332
In here.

1340
01:32:49,037 --> 01:32:50,568
Strange, how?

1341
01:32:58,468 --> 01:32:59,908
Helen?

1342
01:33:00,369 --> 01:33:02,400
Helen, what are you?...

1343
01:33:10,693 --> 01:33:12,708
Helen, it's me.

1344
01:33:28,976 --> 01:33:31,179
Incredibile, pull over.

1345
01:33:36,886 --> 01:33:38,548
We can't go to E's.

1346
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,282
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius,

1347
01:33:41,307 --> 01:33:42,939
they were wearing them, too.

1348
01:33:42,964 --> 01:33:45,720
They're all under someone's control.

1349
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:48,999
They've probably done the same
to mom.

1350
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:54,763
OK, bad guys after us,
no mom, no dad, no Lucius.

1351
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:58,941
But, we have our powers, this car

1352
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:00,999
and...

1353
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,675
what?

1354
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:18,005
Incredibile, take us to Devtech!

1355
01:34:21,474 --> 01:34:25,317
Kids have escaped in a tricked out car,
but we got Frozone.

1356
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:28,102
Bring him to the ship at Devtech,
immediately.

1357
01:34:33,195 --> 01:34:35,670
Aww! We missed'em.

1358
01:34:35,845 --> 01:34:39,874
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1359
01:34:42,478 --> 01:34:44,503
- What did you do?
- I dunno.

1360
01:34:44,536 --> 01:34:48,003
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

1361
01:34:55,302 --> 01:34:58,278
Wow, this car does anything I say!

1362
01:35:05,662 --> 01:35:09,217
- We didn't plan this, well.
- What do you mean? We're here, aren't we?

1363
01:35:09,242 --> 01:35:13,154
Yes, we're here.
We need to be up there.

1364
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:15,382
Hm...

1365
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:19,169
I think, the Incredibile has
ejector seats.

1366
01:35:20,032 --> 01:35:21,725
Wait, what? No.

1367
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,475
- Yeah, baby, let's go!
- No, no.

1368
01:35:32,049 --> 01:35:33,539
Come on.

1369
01:35:36,424 --> 01:35:38,193
Hello, glad you could come.

1370
01:35:38,218 --> 01:35:40,522
- Welcome to the conference.
- Good to be here.

1371
01:35:50,361 --> 01:35:53,592
Our stars, where are they?
The event's about to start.

1372
01:35:53,617 --> 01:35:55,682
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1373
01:35:55,707 --> 01:35:57,659
<i>They'll join for the signing.</i>

1374
01:35:58,176 --> 01:36:00,640
Welcme guests, you're in for a treat.

1375
01:36:00,689 --> 01:36:04,682
This ship is the largest hydrofoil
on the planet.

1376
01:36:04,796 --> 01:36:09,342
So, hold onto something because
we're gonna open her up!

1377
01:36:27,278 --> 01:36:29,119
We need to find mom and dad.

1378
01:36:29,144 --> 01:36:30,964
Stay here, I'm gonna
search for them.

1379
01:36:30,989 --> 01:36:33,760
Wait, who's gonna watch Jack-Jack?

1380
01:36:33,785 --> 01:36:35,815
Suck it up, I won't be long.

1381
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,402
Wait. What? But, but... Wait!

1382
01:36:38,427 --> 01:36:41,049
This is important,
they are in trouble.

1383
01:36:41,074 --> 01:36:44,116
It's up to us.
'To us', understand?

1384
01:36:44,141 --> 01:36:46,826
Keep him amused, but quiet!

1385
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,550
Ohhh...

1386
01:37:07,211 --> 01:37:08,739
Jack-Jack?

1387
01:37:18,086 --> 01:37:20,447
Jack-Jack? Jack-Jack!

1388
01:37:53,423 --> 01:37:56,195
- Jack-Jack.
- *Now, the supers know we're here.

1389
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,531
But, I found mom and dad.

1390
01:37:57,563 --> 01:37:59,198
- Where is Jack-Jack?
- I dunno.

1391
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:02,238
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1392
01:38:02,263 --> 01:38:04,631
The tracker. Use the tracker.

1393
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,155
- He's going up?
- He's in an elevator.

1394
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:11,772
Let's go!

1395
01:38:13,449 --> 01:38:15,989
Hey, little baby,
where are your paren...?

1396
01:38:18,318 --> 01:38:19,925
And here they are, folks!

1397
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:23,528
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1398
01:38:23,577 --> 01:38:25,636
<i>I told you they'd be there in time.</i>

1399
01:38:25,763 --> 01:38:27,970
Hey, did you make them new masks?

1400
01:38:27,995 --> 01:38:31,213
Yeah, night vision, etcetera...
They look, good, right?

1401
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:33,058
So simple, even he can do it.

1402
01:38:33,129 --> 01:38:34,878
And we're back, live, in ...

1403
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:37,032
3, 2, 1.

1404
01:38:37,075 --> 01:38:38,751
This is a momentous occasion.

1405
01:38:38,776 --> 01:38:41,521
We've all managed to
accomplish something

1406
01:38:41,546 --> 01:38:44,192
extraordinarily rare
in today's world:

1407
01:38:44,243 --> 01:38:46,372
we agree on something.

1408
01:38:48,857 --> 01:38:52,168
We agree to undo a bad decision.

1409
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:54,886
To make sure a few
extraordinarily gifted members

1410
01:38:54,911 --> 01:38:57,880
of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.

1411
01:38:57,905 --> 01:38:59,801
To invite them once again,

1412
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:02,501
to use their gifts to benefit the world.

1413
01:39:02,533 --> 01:39:03,926
I thank all of you

1414
01:39:03,951 --> 01:39:07,280
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1415
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:09,764
With special thanks to
Ambassador Salomon.

1416
01:39:09,789 --> 01:39:11,848
Yup, it's OK, let her hear you.

1417
01:39:11,873 --> 01:39:14,049
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Ambassador,

1418
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:16,522
for your early and very crucial support.

1419
01:39:16,547 --> 01:39:19,198
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you

1420
01:39:19,223 --> 01:39:21,021
to be the first signature on the

1421
01:39:21,046 --> 01:39:24,695
International Superhero Accord.

1422
01:39:25,201 --> 01:39:26,748
There it is.

1423
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,924
Holy cow!

1424
01:39:42,949 --> 01:39:45,824
- *He's always on fire.
- Just put him out!

1425
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:53,974
They're coming.

1426
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:04,522
Is he okay?

1427
01:40:04,547 --> 01:40:07,436
*Yeah, unless you have a beter idea.

1428
01:40:31,814 --> 01:40:33,237
No!

1429
01:40:34,267 --> 01:40:36,094
Come on, Jack-Jack, we have to go.

1430
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:37,922
Cookie, num-num?

1431
01:40:51,174 --> 01:40:53,897
- I see him. He's getting away.
- Stand back!

1432
01:40:58,172 --> 01:41:00,798
- Darn it.
- He's heading for mom.

1433
01:41:02,539 --> 01:41:06,126
It is done, the world is super again!

1434
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,132
Group photo, come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1435
01:41:14,157 --> 01:41:16,318
Squeeze in, that's it, historic occasion.

1436
01:41:16,807 --> 01:41:18,442
Everyone smile.

1437
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:26,825
Go for Phase 2.

1438
01:41:26,871 --> 01:41:30,832
Years of mandated hiding and
silence have made us bitter.

1439
01:41:30,857 --> 01:41:32,789
You bring us out into the light,

1440
01:41:32,814 --> 01:41:36,379
only to clean up the messes your
lack of discipline creates.

1441
01:41:36,404 --> 01:41:39,129
Your bodies and your
character are weak.

1442
01:41:39,154 --> 01:41:42,644
Your promises are empty
and you will pay for it.

1443
01:41:42,669 --> 01:41:45,940
We no longer serve you.
We serve only us.

1444
01:41:45,979 --> 01:41:48,197
May the fittest survive.

1445
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:51,867
Well, we, uh...

1446
01:41:51,944 --> 01:41:54,395
Some very alarming moments there...

1447
01:41:54,437 --> 01:41:57,106
before the technical difficulties.

1448
01:41:57,131 --> 01:41:58,840
Please, bear with us.

1449
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:15,710
- Mayday, mayday, mayday ...
- Hold it. Let him talk.

1450
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:17,934
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat:...

1451
01:42:17,959 --> 01:42:19,529
Now!

1452
01:42:30,286 --> 01:42:32,903
A little further...
A little further...

1453
01:42:32,936 --> 01:42:34,575
Stop!

1454
01:42:39,543 --> 01:42:41,788
What the? A baby?!

1455
01:42:41,937 --> 01:42:44,320
Mom and dad! Uncle Lucius?

1456
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:49,295
Jack-Jack, no!

1457
01:42:51,218 --> 01:42:54,708
A, superbaby? No, no, no.

1458
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:01,227
No, no, no, no, put him down!

1459
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:05,358
- Grab her!
- Mom. - Get Jack-Jack to safety!*

1460
01:43:13,288 --> 01:43:14,850
NO!

1461
01:43:15,979 --> 01:43:19,401
- Hey, it's me!
- Yeah, that's what I thought, last time.

1462
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,178
What?...

1463
01:43:22,982 --> 01:43:25,358
You came for us?

1464
01:43:25,604 --> 01:43:28,060
- Don't be mad.
- Oh sweetie.

1465
01:43:28,287 --> 01:43:30,149
How could I be mad?

1466
01:43:30,384 --> 01:43:32,157
I'm proud.

1467
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:34,750
Not to break up a tender moment,
but,

1468
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:37,139
where are we?
Is this Devtech's ship?

1469
01:43:37,164 --> 01:43:39,338
Evelyn Deavor, controls
the Screenslaver,

1470
01:43:39,363 --> 01:43:41,992
and until a second ago, us.

1471
01:43:43,453 --> 01:43:46,379
- Where the crew?
<i>- Collision detected, correct course.</i>

1472
01:43:46,437 --> 01:43:48,410
- Did I do that?
- Mom?

1473
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,595
Here, try this.

1474
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:52,880
<i>Collision detected, correct course.</i>

1475
01:43:53,551 --> 01:43:56,323
Phase 3. Go on phase 3!

1476
01:43:59,142 --> 01:44:01,397
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1477
01:44:01,422 --> 01:44:03,467
I went to the house!
You didn't escape?

1478
01:44:03,492 --> 01:44:06,321
- How did you not escape?
- Hey, we saved you!

1479
01:44:06,346 --> 01:44:08,289
Escape? Escape from what?

1480
01:44:11,312 --> 01:44:12,839
Those guys!

1481
01:44:15,963 --> 01:44:17,713
Jack-Jack, has powers?!

1482
01:44:17,738 --> 01:44:20,088
We know. Fight, now, talk later.

1483
01:44:55,046 --> 01:44:56,711
Laser eyes.

1484
01:45:17,897 --> 01:45:19,140
Oh!

1485
01:45:24,097 --> 01:45:26,640
- Come with me, Winston.
- Did I faint?

1486
01:45:26,665 --> 01:45:29,975
- You'll be safe here.
- Safe? Safe from what?

1487
01:45:31,067 --> 01:45:34,838
- What about those diplomats and the supers?
- Still hypnotized.

1488
01:45:35,559 --> 01:45:37,426
What have you done?

1489
01:45:41,318 --> 01:45:43,269
Evelyn. She's escaping!

1490
01:45:43,294 --> 01:45:45,597
Well, go after her.
Finish your mission.

1491
01:45:45,622 --> 01:45:47,050
I can't just go.

1492
01:45:47,075 --> 01:45:48,644
What about the kids? Jack-Jack?

1493
01:45:48,669 --> 01:45:50,409
- Who's gonna?...
- Mom!

1494
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:52,562
Go! We've got this.

1495
01:45:54,371 --> 01:45:55,998
Voyd, come with me.

1496
01:45:56,023 --> 01:45:58,902
- I'll go shut down the engine.
- I'll try to to slow the ship from the bow*.

1497
01:45:58,927 --> 01:46:02,192
Wait, something's missing.
Where the Crusher gone?

1498
01:46:02,258 --> 01:46:04,106
Strap in, now!

1499
01:46:19,301 --> 01:46:21,231
It's for your own good.

1500
01:46:21,287 --> 01:46:22,793
NO!

1501
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:24,650
This is!

1502
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:38,254
- Were too late.
- Get me up to the jet.

1503
01:47:01,676 --> 01:47:04,668
Hey, you did this. Can you undo it?

1504
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,708
You want me to un-crush?

1505
01:47:06,733 --> 01:47:08,871
What, no one's ever asked
for that?

1506
01:47:08,896 --> 01:47:11,621
No, to un-crush is silly!
Why un-crush?

1507
01:47:11,646 --> 01:47:14,811
To get into the engine room. Aw,
forget, it, we don't have enough time.

1508
01:47:14,836 --> 01:47:18,375
What if I said to un-punch someone?
What you do*?

1509
01:47:21,876 --> 01:47:23,663
Welcome aboard Elastigirl.

1510
01:47:23,723 --> 01:47:26,864
Although, we haven't yet
reached our cruising altitude...

1511
01:47:27,821 --> 01:47:30,335
feel free to roam about the cabin.

1512
01:47:30,546 --> 01:47:33,599
*Just relax, I'll take care
of everything.

1513
01:47:33,624 --> 01:47:35,609
We're all about you.

1514
01:47:44,966 --> 01:47:48,249
- I can't get to the engine room.
- Well, we gotta to do something.

1515
01:47:48,274 --> 01:47:49,847
'Cause trying to slow it down
ain't working.

1516
01:47:49,872 --> 01:47:53,010
- Hey, what about turning the boat?
- The steering's been destroyed.

1517
01:47:53,035 --> 01:47:55,267
- Dash means, from the outside.
- Yeah!

1518
01:47:55,292 --> 01:47:58,087
If we break off one of the
foils arnd turn the rudder

1519
01:47:58,112 --> 01:48:00,233
we can steer the ship
away from the city.

1520
01:48:00,258 --> 01:48:02,926
- That might work.
- I'll turn the front, you turn the rear.

1521
01:48:02,951 --> 01:48:05,231
Using the rudder?
That's under water!

1522
01:48:05,256 --> 01:48:07,469
How am I supposed to?...
Oh, great.

1523
01:48:07,579 --> 01:48:09,638
- Come on, kids.
- Dad!

1524
01:48:09,782 --> 01:48:14,085
I know this is going to work,
but, if it doesn't, and we crash,

1525
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:17,651
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1526
01:48:17,676 --> 01:48:21,174
I should stay here, with Jack-Jack.

1527
01:48:21,471 --> 01:48:22,954
That's my girl.

1528
01:48:22,986 --> 01:48:26,184
Remember Bob,
we're both turning right.

1529
01:48:32,608 --> 01:48:34,701
You know what's sad?

1530
01:48:37,853 --> 01:48:40,149
If it weren't for your core beliefs,

1531
01:48:40,196 --> 01:48:42,482
I think we copuld've been
good friends.

1532
01:48:43,148 --> 01:48:44,838
I wish I ha...

1533
01:48:45,643 --> 01:48:47,463
had core beliefs.

1534
01:48:49,236 --> 01:48:50,775
We have breaking news.

1535
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,439
While there is still no radio contact,
the ship has changed direction

1536
01:48:54,464 --> 01:48:57,618
and is heading towards land
at a high rate of speed.

1537
01:49:01,604 --> 01:49:03,074
Dash.

1538
01:49:04,015 --> 01:49:05,896
I am going to the rudder.

1539
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:08,887
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1540
01:49:08,912 --> 01:49:11,841
- OK, dad.
- Now, lower me dow ...

1541
01:49:14,835 --> 01:49:18,169
The reputations of superheroes
are ruined.

1542
01:49:18,371 --> 01:49:20,763
You will never become legal.

1543
01:49:20,788 --> 01:49:22,231
Ever!

1544
01:49:22,279 --> 01:49:24,873
- Never?
- No.

1545
01:49:25,178 --> 01:49:27,073
- Ever?
- No!

1546
01:49:27,121 --> 01:49:30,211
Not even a little smidgie-widgie?

1547
01:49:30,236 --> 01:49:31,773
Ah, hypoxia!

1548
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:35,552
When you don't have enough oxygen
things *seem incredibly silly.

1549
01:49:42,939 --> 01:49:46,305
*Things get sillier and sillier
and then you die.

1550
01:49:46,883 --> 01:49:49,905
- I don't wanna die.
- Ah, nobody does.

1551
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:52,421
Really.

1552
01:49:52,446 --> 01:49:54,516
Not such a bad way to go.

1553
01:50:12,707 --> 01:50:15,582
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1554
01:50:15,622 --> 01:50:18,104
All supers protect
your ambassadors.

1555
01:50:18,951 --> 01:50:20,521
Follow!

1556
01:50:22,925 --> 01:50:25,765
Dad's been underwater for too long.

1557
01:50:33,409 --> 01:50:35,053
Gotta pull him up!

1558
01:50:35,078 --> 01:50:36,987
Wait, it's too soon.

1559
01:50:50,328 --> 01:50:53,425
- I'm gonna press the button!
- Not yet!

1560
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:10,471
It's turning. It's working!

1561
01:51:13,472 --> 01:51:15,814
- Now!
- Dash, now!

1562
01:51:18,905 --> 01:51:21,153
Save yourself, make a chute.

1563
01:51:24,171 --> 01:51:26,375
Make a chute. Make a chute!

1564
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:30,860
*Dash, brace yourself!

1565
01:51:38,405 --> 01:51:40,590
*We're out of position!

1566
01:52:01,648 --> 01:52:04,388
I missed Jack-Jack's first power?

1567
01:52:04,413 --> 01:52:07,374
Actually, you missed the first 17.

1568
01:52:08,045 --> 01:52:09,467
Oh!

1569
01:52:20,618 --> 01:52:24,240
The fact you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1570
01:52:24,807 --> 01:52:28,546
- But, it does make you alive.
- And I'm grateful for that.

1571
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:31,479
I'm sorry, but she'll go to prison.

1572
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,911
Well, I'm sorry, she's rich
and will probably get

1573
01:52:33,936 --> 01:52:35,701
no more than a slap on the wrist.

1574
01:52:35,726 --> 01:52:38,247
First of all, Violet I like you.

1575
01:52:38,702 --> 01:52:41,522
And who knows what the
future may bring?

1576
01:52:41,637 --> 01:52:45,094
But, I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1577
01:52:45,692 --> 01:52:48,371
Good feeling?
Should we be worried?

1578
01:52:48,568 --> 01:52:50,987
You guys got the next shift.
Come here.

1579
01:52:51,012 --> 01:52:53,339
I saw what you did back there,
that was incredible.

1580
01:52:53,365 --> 01:52:56,465
- I mean, no pun intended.
- Sorry I had to punch you.

1581
01:52:57,862 --> 01:53:00,721
Ah, *here's my sweet ride!

1582
01:53:13,766 --> 01:53:18,233
And in recognition of the extraordinary
service they have demonstrated,

1583
01:53:18,258 --> 01:53:23,115
the legal status of superheroes
is hereby restored.

1584
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:36,444
- You don't know me, do you?
- No, I don't, wait ...

1585
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:40,064
- Are you the girl with the water...?
- I'm Violet Parr.

1586
01:53:41,282 --> 01:53:42,817
I'm Tony.

1587
01:53:53,471 --> 01:53:55,790
- Tony, this is my mom.
- Pleased to meet you.

1588
01:53:55,862 --> 01:53:58,196
- It's my dad.
- Oh, we've met.♥

1589
01:53:58,221 --> 01:54:01,230
- This is embarrassing.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

1590
01:54:01,255 --> 01:54:02,817
My little brother Dash.

1591
01:54:03,049 --> 01:54:05,141
And baby is Jack-Jack.

1592
01:54:05,742 --> 01:54:09,100
I tried to limit it
to ONE parent.

1593
01:54:09,103 --> 01:54:11,663
We're all going to a movie, too, Tony.
Don't mind us.

1594
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:14,124
We'll be sitting on the other
side of theater.

1595
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:16,038
- Not watching you.
- Hah!

1596
01:54:16,581 --> 01:54:20,665
H-He's kidding, they're only
dropping us off at the theater.

1597
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:23,395
They have OTHER things to do.

1598
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:27,295
- So, you guys are close, I guess.
- Yeah, I guess.

1599
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,527
- We can get closer.
- Bob.

1600
01:54:44,234 --> 01:54:45,852
Stop! Let us out.

1601
01:54:45,976 --> 01:54:50,015
Here: large popcorn, small soda,
save me a seat. *Center rear preferably

1602
01:54:50,126 --> 01:54:53,767
I'll be back before the
previews are over.

1603
