AMERICAN MINISTRY OF MAGIC

2
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:53,617
NEW YORK, 1927

3
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,799
You'll be glad to be rid of him, I expect.

4
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,614
We'd be more than happy to
keep him here in custody.

5
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,576
Six months are enough.

6
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:41,564
It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.

7
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:44,809
President Picquery, Mr. Spielman, sir.

8
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:47,483
Prisoner is secured and ready
to travel.

9
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,880
You've thrown everything at him, I see.

10
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,650
It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.

11
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:05,016
We've had to change his
guard three times, he's very... persuasive.

12
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:06,964
So we removed his tongue.

13
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,325
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

14
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:18,271
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

15
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:22,969
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

16
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,969
The wizarding community worldwide owes
you a great debt, Madam President.

17
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,554
Do not underestimate him.

18
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,938
Mr. Spielman, we found
his wand hidden away.

19
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,349
Abernathy?

20
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:53,515
And we found this.

21
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,309
No more silver tongue, hmm?

22
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:05,310
You have joined a noble cause, my friend.

23
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:19,080
I know. I know. I know, Antonio

24
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:26,875
So needy.

FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD
<font color="#ff00ff">Subtitled by Clarity.</font>

00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,434
BRITISH MINISTRY OF MAGIC

27
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,403
THREE MONTHS LATER

28
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,159
They're ready for you, Newt.

29
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,391
Leta...

30
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:44,778
What are you doing here?

31
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:48,723
Theseus thought it would be good if I
became part of the Ministry family.

32
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:52,420
Did he actually say the
words “Ministry family”?

33
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,968
That sounds like my brother

34
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,823
Theseus was disappointed you
couldn't come to dinner.

35
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,255
Any of the nights we've asked you.

36
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,623
Well, I've been busy.

37
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:20,875
He's your brother, Newt.

38
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,723
He likes spending time with you.

39
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:24,973
And so do I.

40
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:32,636
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

41
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:36,859
Why do strange creatures love you so much?

42
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,318
- Well, there are no strange creatures...
- Only blinkered people!

43
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:47,054
How long did you get in detention
for saying that to Prendergast?

44
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:49,682
You know, I think it was a month that time.

45
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:54,432
And I set off a Dung bomb under his desk
so I could join you, do you remember?

46
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,724
No, I actually don't remember that.

47
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:03,831
Hello.

48
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:07,773
Theseus. We were just talking
about Newt coming for dinner

49
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,131
Really? Well...

50
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,576
Look, before we go in there I

51
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,467
It's my fifth attempt, Theseus.
I know the form.

52
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,805
This isn't going to be like
the other times. This is...

53
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:19,897
Just try and
keep an open mind, will you?

54
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:23,227
- And maybe a little less.
- Like me?

55
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:28,076
Well, it can't hurt.
Come on. Let's go.

56
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,543
Hearing commences...

57
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,643
You want an end to the ban on your
traveling internationally. Why?

58
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:45,376
Because I like to
travel internationally.

59
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:50,602
Subject uncooperative and evasive on
reasons for last international trip.

60
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,268
It was a field trip.

61
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:55,357
So I was collecting material for
my book on magical beasts

62
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,042
You destroyed half of New York.

63
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,477
No, that's actually factually
incorrect on two counts

64
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,044
Newt!

65
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:03,690
Mr. Scamander...

66
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:08,556
it's clear you're frustrated
and, frankly, so are we.

67
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:14,186
In the spirit of compromise,
we'd like to make a proposition.

68
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,483
What kind of proposition?

69
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,754
The committee will agree to lift
your travel ban under one condition.

70
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,784
You join the Ministry.

71
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,641
Specifically, your brother's department.

72
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:29,943
No.

73
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,491
I-that isn't my kind of...

74
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,272
Theseus is the Auror...

75
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:37,796
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

76
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,953
Mr. Scamander. The wizarding
and non-wizarding

77
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,247
worlds have been at peace
for over a century.

78
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,005
Grindelwald wants to see that peace
destroyed.

79
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,263
And for certain members of our
community his message is very seductive.

80
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:56,979
Many pure-bloods believe it
is their birthright to rule

81
00:11:57,004 --> 00:12:00,886
not only our world but the
non-magic world as well.

82
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,435
They see Grindelwald as their hero,

83
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:07,916
and Grindelwald sees this boy

84
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,956
as a means
to make this all come true.

85
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:16,262
I'm sorry. You're talking about
Credence as if he were still here.

86
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,406
He survived, Newt.

87
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:21,696
He is still alive.

88
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:24,554
He left New York months ago.

89
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:27,963
He's somewhere in Europe. Where
exactly, we don't know, but...

90
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,472
And you want me to hunt Credence down?

91
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:32,614
To kill him?

92
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,698
Same old Scamander.

93
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,757
What's he doing here?

94
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:42,768
Taking on the job you're too soft to do.

95
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,146
Is that it?

96
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,908
Travel documentation denied.

97
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,096
Newt!

98
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,601
You think I like the idea of
Grimmson any more than you do?

99
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,846
Listen, I don't want to hear how
the ends justify the means, Theseus.

100
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,307
I think you're gonna have to
pull your head out of the sand!

101
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,860
Okay, right, here we go. What a selfish...
irresponsible...

102
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,718
You know, the time is
coming when everyone's

103
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:14,227
everyone's gonna have to pick a side.
Even you.

104
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,858
I don't do sides.

105
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,162
Newt.

106
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,428
Newt.

107
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,277
C'mere.

108
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,999
They are watching you.

109
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,519
Well, gentlemen.

110
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:56,229
I assume this means
I have the job.

111
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:07,374
PARIS, FRANCE

112
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:46,298
Chérie?

113
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,716
Who's there?

114
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:21,190
This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.

115
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:24,959
I want you to
go to the circus now.

116
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,469
Give my note to Credence,

117
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,150
begin his journey.

118
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:32,707
When we've won, they'll flee
cities in the millions.

119
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,370
They've had their time.

120
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:37,316
We don't say such things out loud.

121
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:39,084
We want only freedom.

122
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,488
Freedom to be ourselves.

123
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,848
To annihilate non-wizards.

124
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,192
Not all of them. Not all.

125
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,575
We're not merciless.

126
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:53,004
The beast of burden
will always be necessary.

127
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,636
[London, UK]

128
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:01,979
Ventus.

129
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,607
Dumbledore.

130
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:51,487
Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?

131
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,513
I do enjoy a view.

132
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:57,497
Nebulus.

133
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,243
How was it?

134
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,837
They're still convinced that
you sent me to New York.

135
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,034
You told them I didn't?

136
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,035
Yes.

137
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:13,543
Even though you did.

138
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,246
You told me where to find
that trafficked Thunderbird,

139
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,211
Dumbledore. You knew that I
would take him home and you

140
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,767
knew I'd have to take him through
a Muggle port.

141
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:23,502
Well, I've always felt an affinity with
the great magical birds..

142
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,902
There's a story in my family

143
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:29,957
that a phoenix will come to any
Dumbledore who is in desperate need.

144
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:34,930
They say my great-great grandfather had
one, but that it took flight when he died,

145
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:36,589
never to return.

146
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:39,887
With all due respect, I
don't believe for a minute

147
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,520
that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.

148
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,814
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

149
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,060
He's trying to trace his real family.

150
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,481
I take it.

151
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:56,838
You've heard the rumors

152
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:57,984
about who he really is?

153
00:18:58,644 --> 00:18:59,859
No.

154
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:11,502
The pure-bloods think he's
the last of an important French line,

155
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,101
a baby whom
everyone thought lost

156
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:19,486
- Not Leta's brother?
- That's what they're whispering.

157
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:23,064
Pure-blood or not, I know this...

158
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:26,131
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

159
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,528
as a dark twin, an only friend.

160
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,024
If Credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,

161
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,619
he might yet be saved.

162
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:40,412
Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's
either in danger or a danger to others.

163
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,479
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

164
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:48,151
And I rather hoped you might
be the one to find him.

165
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,754
What's that?

166
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:59,256
An address of a very
old acquaintance of mine.

167
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:03,634
A safe house in Paris,
reinforced with enchantments.

168
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,040
Safe house? Why would I
need a safe house in Paris?

169
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,705
One hopes you won't, but
should things at some point

170
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,217
go terribly wrong,
it's good to have a place to go.

171
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,644
You know, for a cup of tea.

172
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:16,558
No, no, no, absolutely not.

173
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,658
I'm banned from international
travel, Dumbledore.

174
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,754
If I leave the country, they will put
me in Azkaban and throw away the key.

175
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,577
Do you know why I admire you, Newt?

176
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:25,598
What?

177
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,157
More, perhaps, than any
man I know?

178
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:34,250
You don't seek power or popularity.

179
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:39,909
You simply ask, is the thing
right in itself?

180
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,862
If it is, you do
it, no matter the cost.

181
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,803
That's all very well, Dumbledore,
but, forgive me for asking,

182
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,779
why can't you go?

183
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,618
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

184
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:00,916
It has to be you.

185
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,283
Well, I can't blame you,

186
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:12,132
in your shoes I'd probably refuse too.

187
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,415
- What...?
- It's late.

188
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,479
- Good evening, Newt.
- Wait. No!

189
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,617
Oh, come on.

190
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:33,969
Dumbledore.

191
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,671
Bunty!

192
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,090
Bunty!

193
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:51,763
Bunty, the baby Nifflers are loose again!

194
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:03,417
Well done

195
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:04,768
I'm so sorry, Newt.

196
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,769
They must have picked the lock while I was
cleaning out the Augureys

197
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,808
Not to worry.

198
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:17,613
I've fed nearly everyone,
Pinky's had his nose drops, and

199
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:18,448
And Elsie?

200
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:21,874
- Elsie's droppings are nearly normal again.
- Wonderful.

201
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,007
You can clock off now...

202
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:30,667
- I told you to leave the Kelpie to me.
- That wound needs more ointment.

203
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:32,731
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

204
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:45,014
Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.

205
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:47,455
You must be exhausted.

206
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,883
You know the Kelpie's easier with two.

207
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,418
Perhaps you should take off your shirt?

208
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,132
Don't worry, I'll dry off quickly enough.

209
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,901
Someone needed to let off some steam.

210
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,514
Ointment, Bunty?

211
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,216
You bite Bunty again and
there'll be trouble, mister.

212
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:02,216
- What was that?
- I don't know.

213
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,993
But I want you to go home now, Bunty.

214
00:25:06,994 --> 00:25:10,807
- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No, I want you to go home. Please.

215
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:20,527
If you could just give it to me...

216
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,059
Honey, if you could just give it to me.

217
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,182
- He doesn't care. Hold it.
- If you could just give it to me.

218
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,227
Hey...

219
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:37,868
NEWT! Get over here, you maniac.

220
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,305
We hope you don't mind, Newt?
We let ourselves in...

221
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,902
it's raining
out there-cats and dogs!

222
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:45,391
London's cold!

223
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:48,196
But you were supposed
to have been Obliviated!

224
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,631
I know!
It didn't work, pal.

225
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:54,032
I mean, you said it, the potion
only erases bad memories.

226
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,276
I didn't have any.

227
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:59,670
I mean, don't get me wrong, I had
some weird ones...

228
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:00,979
but this angel...

229
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:05,035
this angel over here, she filled
me in on all the bad parts.

230
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,668
And here we are, I guess, huh?

231
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:10,423
This is wonderful!

232
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:16,171
Is ...Tina?

233
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:18,751
Tina?

234
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:22,803
Oh it's just us, honey.

235
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:25,026
Me and Jacob.

236
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,788
Why don't I make us some dinner, huh?

237
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:29,814
Yes!

238
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:38,325
Tina and I aren't talking.

239
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:39,667
Why?

240
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:42,322
Oh well, you know, she
found out about Jacob and

241
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,814
I seeing each other and
she didn't like it,

242
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:46,352
cause of the “law.”

243
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:50,538
Not allowed oops, not
allowed to date No-Majs,

244
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,851
not allowed to marry them blah, blah, blah.

245
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:57,606
Well, she was all in a tizzy
anyway, 'cause of you.

246
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:58,791
Me?

247
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,593
Yeah, you, Newt.

248
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,661
It was in Spellbound.

249
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,606
Here-I brought it for you-

250
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:12,473
Newt Scamander with
fiancée, Leta Lestrange...

251
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,632
brother, Theseus
and unknown woman.

252
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:18,472
No. Theseus is marrying Leta, not me.

253
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,651
Oh!

254
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,451
Oh, oh dear.

255
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:25,667
Wah.

256
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:31,554
So Tina read that, and she started dating
someone else.

257
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:35,114
He's an Auror. His name's
Achilles Tolliver.

258
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:36,399
Tolliver?

259
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:46,141
Anyway... We're real
excited to be here, Newt.

260
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:49,661
This is a, oh
it's a special trip for us

261
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,514
You see, Jacob and I,

262
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,894
we're getting married.

263
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,813
I'm marrying Jacob!

264
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,255
You've enchanted him, haven't you?

265
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:11,401
What?

266
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,122
I have not.

267
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,632
Will you stop reading my mind?

268
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,429
Queenie, you've brought him
here against his will.

269
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:21,537
Oh, that is an
outrageous accusation.

270
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:25,570
Look at him. He's just happy.

271
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,443
Then you won't mind if I...

272
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:30,369
Please don't!

273
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,109
Queenie, you've got nothing to
fear if he wants to get married.

274
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,059
We can just lift the enchantment...
and he can tell us himself.

275
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,506
What you got there?

276
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:51,510
Whatchu gonna do? Whatchu gonna do with
that, Mr. Scamander?

277
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,772
<i>Surgito.</i>

278
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:06,324
Congratulations on
your engagement, Jacob.

279
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,349
Wait, what?

280
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,351
Oh no, you didn't.

281
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,958
Queen. A second.

282
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:20,229
Queenie!

283
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:22,929
It's very nice to see you.

284
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,625
Where the hell am I right now?

285
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:25,626
Uh, uh, London.

286
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,514
Oh! I always wanted to go here!

287
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,935
Queenie!

288
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,867
Oh Queenie, honey.

289
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:40,230
Well, I'm just curious, when were you going
to wake me up? After we'd had five kids?

290
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:45,956
- Why is it wrong to want to marry you?
- Okay.

291
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:48,609
To wanna have a family?

292
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,444
I just want what everyone
else has, that's all.

293
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:54,591
Okay, wait..

294
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,351
We talked about this,
like, a million times.

295
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:59,068
If we get married and
they find out, they're

296
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,478
gonna throw you in
jail, sweetheart.

297
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,509
I can't have that.

298
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:05,918
They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.

299
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,918
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

300
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:13,453
They're really progressive here, and
they'll let us get married properly.

301
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:16,008
Sweetheart, you don't need to enchant me.

302
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,129
I'm already enchanted!

303
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:21,268
I love you so much.

304
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:22,977
- Yeah??
- Yeah.

305
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:26,481
But I can't have you risking
everything like this, you know?

306
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:29,357
You're not giving us a choice, sweetheart.

307
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:34,212
You're not givin' me a choice.

308
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:37,969
One of us had to be brave, and you
were being a coward!

309
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,856
I was being a coward?

310
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,115
If I'm a coward, you're...

311
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,703
Crazy!

312
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,694
I didn't say it...

313
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:50,838
You didn't have to.

314
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,653
No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

315
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:54,802
Yeah, you did.

316
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:56,856
No!

317
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:58,325
I'm gonna go see my sister.

318
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:00,897
Fine. See your sister.

319
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:02,244
- Fine.
- No! Wait!

320
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,037
Queenie! No! Queenie!

321
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,505
I didn't mean it.

322
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,831
I didn't say nothing.

323
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,557
PARIS

324
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:41,142
My dear Queenie,
what a beautiful city.

325
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,702
I'm thinking of you, Tina.

326
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,416
Hey, Newt?

327
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,617
Down here, Jacob.
I'll be with you in a second.

328
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,672
I got my own problems.

329
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,761
BUNTY! DON'T FORGET TO
GIVE PATRICK PELLETS.

330
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:27,387
Queenie left a postcard.

331
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,659
Tina's in Paris looking for Credence.

332
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,948
Genius!

333
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,621
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

334
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:34,694
Okay, we're going to France, pal!

335
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,032
Hold on. I'll get my jacket.

336
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,033
I've got it.

337
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:46,585
Oh. Beautiful.

338
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,769
BUNTY, GONE TO PARIS. HAVE
TAKEN NIFFLERS WITH ME. NEWT.

339
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,966
Nagini.

340
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:13,855
Credence.

341
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,605
I think I know where she is.

342
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:26,764
We escape tonight.

343
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:27,765
Hey.

344
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:36,490
I've told you to stay away from her, boy.

345
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,907
Did I say you could
take a break?

346
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:40,982
Clean out the Kappa.

347
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,570
And you, get ready!

348
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:01,873
Next in our little show of
freaks and oddities...

349
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:04,508
I present to you...

350
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,234
a Maledictus!

351
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:12,961
Once trapped in the jungles of Indonesia,

352
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:16,481
she is the carrier of a
blood curse.

353
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,875
Such Under-beings are destined,
through the course of their lives...

354
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,922
to turn permanently into beasts.

355
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,206
But look at her. So beautiful, yes?

356
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:36,864
So desirable.

357
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:42,018
But soon she will be trapped
forever in a very different body.

358
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,621
Every night, when she sleeps...

359
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:47,948
mesdames et messieurs...

360
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,070
She is forced to become...

361
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:01,086
She is forced to become...

362
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:09,050
She is forced to become...

363
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,408
Over time, she will not be
able to transform back.

364
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,590
She will be
forever trapped in the body of a snake.

365
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:02,847
Credence!

366
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,408
Pack it up!

367
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:15,776
Paris is done for us now.

368
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,440
The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?

369
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:53,714
He's looking for his mother.

370
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,800
All my freaks think they can go home.

371
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,548
Okay, let's go.

372
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:21,041
Look, I think we were both at the circus
for the same reason, monsieur ...?

373
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:23,752
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

374
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,149
And you think right.

375
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,808
- What do you want with Credence?
- The same as you.

376
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,334
- Which is?
- To prove who the boy really is.

377
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:38,553
If the rumors of his identity are
correct, he and

378
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,841
I are distantly related.

379
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,519
I am the last male of my
pure-blooded line.

380
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,390
And so, if the rumors are correct, is he.

381
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:52,853
Have you read The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus?

382
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,893
Yeah.
But that's poetry, not proof.

383
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,562
If I could show you something better

384
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:07,711
more concrete, something
that proves who he is

385
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:11,549
would the Ministries of Europe and America
let him live?

386
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:13,483
They might.

387
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,212
Then come.

388
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:43,167
So...

389
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,577
Credence Barebone.

390
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,714
Nearly destroyed by the woman who
raised him.

391
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:58,120
Yet now he seeks the mother who bore him.

392
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:00,853
He's desperate for family.

393
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,015
He's desperate for love.

394
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:07,154
He's the key to our victory.

395
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:10,134
Well, we know where the boy is, don't we?

396
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:14,791
- Why don't we grab him and leave!
- He must come to me freely...

397
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,401
and he will.

398
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:22,114
The path has been laid,
and he is following it.

399
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:26,039
The trail that will lead him to me,

400
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:30,737
and the strange and glorious
truth of who he is.

401
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,602
Why is he so important?

402
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,395
Who represents the greatest
threat to our cause?

403
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,727
Albus Dumbledore.

404
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:50,870
If I asked you now to go to the school...
where he is

405
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:55,369
hiding and kill him for me,
would you do it for me, Krall?

406
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:04,886
Credence is the only entity alive...

407
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,302
who can kill him.

408
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,217
You really think that he
can kill the great...

409
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,092
can kill Albus Dumbledore?

410
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:17,944
I know he can.

411
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:23,221
But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?

412
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:27,905
Will you?

413
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,420
Jacob, that man Tina's been seeing...

414
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,019
Don't worry, she's gonna see you.

415
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,828
And she'll see the four of
us together, it'll be just

416
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:47,567
like New York all over again.
Don't worry about it.

417
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,688
- Yes, but he's an Auror, Queenie said?
- Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?

418
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:51,763
Don't worry about him.

419
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,991
What do you think I should
say to her, if I see her?

420
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,310
Oh, well, it's best not
to plan these things.

421
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,210
You know, you just say
whatever comes to you in the moment.

422
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:13,477
She has eyes just like a salamander.

423
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,111
Don't say that.

424
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:22,227
Nah, look, you just tell
her that you missed her.

425
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:26,715
Right, and then you
came all the way to Paris just to find her.

426
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:28,771
She'll love that.

427
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:33,609
And then, tell her you're losing
sleep at night for thinking of her.

428
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,097
Just don't say
anything about no salamanders, all right?

429
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,363
Right. Okay.

430
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:43,478
Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be all right.

431
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:45,080
We're in this together, pal.

432
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,364
Okay, I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna
help you find Tina, find Queenie,

433
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:52,561
and we'll all be happy again.
Just like old times.

434
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:53,586
Who is this guy?

435
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,354
He's the only way I can leave the
country without documentation.

436
00:42:58,355 --> 00:43:01,116
Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?

437
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,728
I don't do well on boats, Newt.

438
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:04,864
You'll be fine.

439
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,462
Stir your stumps-it leaves in one minute!

440
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:09,877
Fifty Galleons.

441
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:11,637
No, we said thirty.

442
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:13,519
Thirty to go to France,

443
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,659
twenty not to tell anyone, I seen Newt
Scamander leaving the country illegally.

444
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,939
Price of fame, pal.

445
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:27,484
Ten seconds.

446
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:30,194
Jacob.

447
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:31,361
Seven.

448
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:33,686
Six

449
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:37,586
Four.

450
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Three.

451
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,742
Two. One.

452
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:54,344
I didn't like that Portkey, Newt.

453
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:55,905
So you keep saying.

454
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:57,263
Follow me.

455
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,393
<i>Confundus.</i>

456
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,232
Come on. That'll wear off in a few minutes.

457
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:26,268
<i>Appare vestigium.</i>

458
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,852
<i>Accio Niffler...</i>

459
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,333
Get looking. Oi! Get looking.

460
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:41,727
That's a Kappa.

461
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,415
That's a Japanese water demon.

462
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:49,895
Tina?

463
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:51,773
Tina?!

464
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,765
What have you found?

465
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,043
And we're licking the dirt now.
Revelio.

466
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:25,828
Newt... what made those?

467
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:27,842
That is a Zouwu.

468
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:34,735
It's a Chinese creature. They are
incredibly fast and incredibly powerful.

469
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:37,062
They can travel a thousand miles in a
day

470
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:41,094
and this one could take you from one part
of Paris to the next in a single leap.

471
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:46,352
Oh, good boy.

472
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,102
Jacob, she was here.
Tina stood here.

473
00:45:51,504 --> 00:45:53,835
She has incredibly narrow
feet, have you noticed?

474
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:57,150
Can't say that I have.

475
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:03,128
Then someone came towards her.

476
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:16,852
<i>Avenseguim.</i>

477
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,851
- Follow that feather.
- What?

478
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:24,812
- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.

479
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,518
Where is he? Ah, Accio Niffler.

480
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:36,918
Let go of the bucket!

481
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,176
<i>Bienvenue Au Ministère
des Affaires Magiques.</i>

482
00:47:17,354 --> 00:47:20,309
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you just said at all.

483
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:25,174
Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic.
What is your business, please?

484
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:29,877
I need to speak to Tina Goldstein.

485
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:35,502
She's an American Auror working
on a case here.

486
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:42,197
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

487
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:45,373
No, it's... I'm sorry there
must be some sort of mistake.

488
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:48,273
See, I know she's in Paris,
she sent me a postcard.

489
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:50,754
I brought it, I can show it to you.
Maybe you

490
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:53,258
can help me find her here?
It's just in here.

491
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,531
Oh rabbits!

492
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:57,017
If you can just wait one moment!

493
00:47:57,018 --> 00:48:00,154
I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it. Where?

494
00:48:00,768 --> 00:48:02,178
One second.

495
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:07,296
<i>Please.</i>

496
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,615
Could we at least stop
for a coffee, or like a...

497
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,693
Not now, Jacob.

498
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:49,970
This way. Come on.

499
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:54,017
Pain Au chocolat? Half a
croissant, or like, a bonbon?

500
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,018
This way.

501
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,267
Jacob!

502
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:16,414
Jacob?

503
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,069
Madame?

504
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,357
Tout Va bien, Madame?

505
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:01,078
She's home.

506
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,460
Qui est là?

507
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,044
C'est votre fils, madame.

508
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:48,316
Qui êtes-vous?

509
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,927
Are you Irma?

510
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:53,464
Are you ...? Are you Irma Dugard?

511
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:59,544
I'm sorry. Your name is
on my adoption paper.

512
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:02,674
Does this make sense?

513
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:07,651
You gave me to Mrs. Barebone in New York.

514
00:52:26,524 --> 00:52:28,083
I am not your mother.

515
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:30,546
I was only a servant.

516
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:36,371
You were so beautiful baby.

517
00:52:39,147 --> 00:52:41,373
And you are a beautiful man.

518
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:54,344
I have missed you.

519
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,463
Why didn't they want me?

520
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:03,883
But why is your name on my adoption
paper?

521
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:06,589
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

522
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:11,322
because she was supposed to look after
you.

523
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:20,257
She's dead.

524
00:55:22,856 --> 00:55:25,488
How did the boy take it?

525
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:27,376
He's sensitive.

526
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:33,483
The Ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I've missed.

527
00:55:33,484 --> 00:55:35,943
- They know my reputation..
- Listen to me...

528
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:40,228
The disapproval of cowards
is praise to the brave.

529
00:55:40,229 --> 00:55:45,729
Your name will be written in glory
when wizards rule the world.

530
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:49,328
And the clock is ticking faster.

531
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:51,621
You watch over Credence.

532
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,568
Keep him safe.

533
00:55:54,468 --> 00:55:56,029
For the greater good.

534
00:55:57,675 --> 00:55:58,989
For the greater good.

535
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:04,858
You know what I miss about Queenie?

536
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:07,885
Everything.

537
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:13,297
I even miss the
stuff that drove me nuts.

538
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:15,019
Like the mind reading.

539
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,710
I was lucky to have someone like her

540
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:26,002
even interested in anything
I thought.

541
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,018
You know what I mean?

542
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,779
Sorry?

543
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,460
I was saying, you're sure the guy
is here that we're looking for?

544
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,633
Definitely. The feather says so.

545
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:15,540
- Is that the guy we're looking for?
- Yes.

546
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:22,391
Sire.

547
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,314
Err... bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.

548
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:27,684
Oh wait, no, sorry!

549
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:31,685
We were just wondering if
you'd come across uh, a friend of ours...

550
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:33,390
Tina Goldstein.

551
00:57:34,004 --> 00:57:36,252
Monsieur, Paris is a large city.

552
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:37,852
She's an Auror..

553
00:57:38,097 --> 00:57:42,723
When Aurors go missing, the
Ministry tend to come looking. So...

554
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:47,614
No, now I suppose it would probably
be better if we just report her absence.

555
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:48,638
Is she tall? Dark? Rather

556
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,912
Dark rather...

557
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,404
- intense?
- Beautiful.

558
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:56,042
Yeah, what I meant to say-

559
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:58,357
she's very-very pretty!

560
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:02,633
I think I saw someone like this last night.

561
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,120
- Perhaps if I showed you where?
- If you wouldn't mind. That would be...

562
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:10,427
- That would be lovely.
- Sure.

563
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:50,252
Tina?

564
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,185
- Newt!
<i>- Expelliarmus!</i>

565
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:59,918
My apologies, Mr. Scamander!

566
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:03,918
I shall return and release you once
Credence is dead!

567
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:04,947
Kama, wait!

568
00:59:04,948 --> 00:59:08,626
You see, either he dies... or I do.

569
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:11,087
No, no, no.

570
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:17,337
Oh no. No, no, no.

571
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,185
Well, that's not the best
start to a rescue attempt.

572
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:28,177
This was a rescue attempt?

573
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:30,778
You've just lost me my only lead.

574
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,667
Well, how was the interrogation
going before we turned up?

575
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:38,518
Newt!

576
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:44,072
Well done, Pick.

577
00:59:46,742 --> 00:59:50,227
- So, you need this man, you say?
- Yeah.

578
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:53,810
I think this man knows where
Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

579
00:59:58,256 --> 01:00:00,261
Well, that'll be the Zouwu.

580
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,527
Come on, Newt, get out of there!

581
01:01:47,594 --> 01:01:51,736
What were the three biggest
mistakes that you made last time?

582
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:54,120
Caught by surprise, sir.

583
01:01:54,518 --> 01:01:55,799
What else?

584
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,245
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

585
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:00,178
Very good. And the last one...

586
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,106
the most important one?

587
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:13,978
Not learning from the first two.

588
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:17,768
This is a school, you've no right

589
01:02:18,018 --> 01:02:22,533
I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement and
I have the right to go wherever I please.

590
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:25,417
Out of here.

591
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,219
Go with Professor McGonagall, please.

592
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:40,479
He's the best teacher we've got.

593
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,765
- Thanks, McClaggan.
- Get out!

594
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:44,318
Come, McClaggan.

595
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,624
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

596
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:54,013
Really?

597
01:02:54,044 --> 01:02:56,579
Cut the pretense. I know
he's there on your orders.

598
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,487
If you'd ever had the
pleasure to teach him, you'd

599
01:02:59,512 --> 01:03:02,076
know Newt is not a great
follower of orders.

600
01:03:04,722 --> 01:03:07,138
You've read The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus??

601
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:08,190
Many years ago.

602
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:13,419
“A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter"

603
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:14,557
- Return.
- Yes, I know it.

604
01:03:16,946 --> 01:03:20,024
There's a rumor this prediction
refers to the Obscurial.

605
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:22,514
They say that Grindelwald wants.

606
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:25,124
A highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.

607
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:30,686
And yet Scamander appears wherever
the Obscurial goes, to protect him.

608
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,908
Meanwhile you have built up quite a
little network of international contacts.

609
01:03:35,909 --> 01:03:39,803
However long you keep me and my
friends under surveillance...

610
01:03:39,804 --> 01:03:43,102
You're not going to discover
plots against you, Travers.

611
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,561
Because we want the same thing:
the defeat of Grindelwald.

612
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:53,829
But I warn you,
your policies of suppression and violence

613
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,285
are pushing supporters
into his arms.

614
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:58,403
I'm not interested in your warnings!

615
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:05,581
Now, it pains me to say it, because

616
01:04:05,872 --> 01:04:07,083
Well, I don't like you.

617
01:04:09,255 --> 01:04:10,352
But...

618
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:17,548
you are the only
wizard who is his equal.

619
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,579
I need you to fight him.

620
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:28,511
I cannot.

621
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,085
Because of this?

622
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:45,477
You and Grindelwald were
as close as brothers.

623
01:04:46,738 --> 01:04:48,617
We were closer than brothers.

624
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,810
Will you fight him?

625
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,393
I can't.

626
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,018
Then you have chosen your side.

627
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:15,597
From now on, I shall know
every spell you cast..

628
01:05:15,598 --> 01:05:16,780
I'm doubling the watch on you

629
01:05:16,781 --> 01:05:19,965
and you will no longer teach
Defense Against the Dark Arts.

630
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:23,977
Where's Leta? We
need to go to Paris!

631
01:05:30,102 --> 01:05:31,258
Theseus.

632
01:05:31,402 --> 01:05:35,615
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally...

633
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:37,459
don't try and break it up.

634
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,832
Don't let Travers send you in there.

635
01:05:41,096 --> 01:05:42,984
If you ever trusted me...

636
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:46,039
Theseus!
Theseus!

637
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:29,365
Even Lestranges makes me feel sick.

638
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:31,180
You know she stays here every vacation.

639
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:32,763
Her family don't actually
want her home.

640
01:06:32,764 --> 01:06:34,591
I don't blame them,
she's so annoying.

641
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,228
- Did you see her last week?
- <i>Oscausi!</i>

642
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,857
Professor McGonagall!
Lestrange has done it again!

643
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:46,942
Lestrange, stop running!

644
01:06:47,105 --> 01:06:50,835
- Lestrange! Disobedient children! Stop!
- She needs to come back!

645
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:52,317
Shame on the House of Slytherin.

646
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:54,345
A hundred points! Two
hundred!

647
01:06:54,346 --> 01:06:56,537
Get back here, right now!

648
01:06:58,794 --> 01:07:03,595
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! You stop
it! Get back!

649
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:11,258
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible!

650
01:07:20,693 --> 01:07:23,072
Scamander... why aren't you packing?

651
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:24,832
I'm not going home.

652
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,489
Why not?

653
01:07:27,426 --> 01:07:28,497
He needs me.

654
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:36,602
It was hurt.

655
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,690
What is that?

656
01:07:45,804 --> 01:07:46,903
A raven chick.

657
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,815
Isn't Raven your family emblem.

658
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,002
Yes it is.

659
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,807
All right, Newt.

660
01:08:06,808 --> 01:08:08,909
Be brave.

661
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:14,681
That's an unusual one.

662
01:08:14,682 --> 01:08:19,653
So Mrs. Scamander fears what more
than anything else in the world?

663
01:08:19,654 --> 01:08:22,404
Having to work in an office, sir.

664
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:24,565
Go ahead, Newt.

665
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

666
01:08:29,078 --> 01:08:30,078
Well done.

667
01:08:31,195 --> 01:08:32,918
Good job. Leta?

668
01:08:35,692 --> 01:08:37,103
It's only a Boggart,

669
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:38,936
it can't hurt you.

670
01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:43,254
Everyone's scared of something

671
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,694
I've been looking forward to this.

672
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,170
I don't want to talk about it!

673
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:52,676
They know me, or they'd hide.

674
01:09:55,907 --> 01:09:59,657
They only nest in trees with wand quality
wood,

675
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:01,817
did you know that?

676
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,446
And they have very complex social lives.

677
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:11,139
If you watch them for
long enough, you realize.

678
01:10:28,953 --> 01:10:30,259
Hello, Leta.

679
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,980
This is a surprise.

680
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,102
Finding me in a classroom?

681
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:40,736
Was I such a bad student?

682
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,998
On the contrary, you
were one of my cleverest

683
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:44,699
I said bad, not stupid.

684
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:52,096
Don't bother answering.

685
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:56,398
- I know you never liked me..
- Well, you're wrong.

686
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,076
I never thought you bad.

687
01:10:58,077 --> 01:11:00,828
You were alone, then. Everybody else did.

688
01:11:01,296 --> 01:11:02,312
And they were right.

689
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:05,052
I was wicked.

690
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:10,111
Leta, I know how painful the rumors
about your brother Corvus must

691
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:11,151
be for you.

692
01:11:11,176 --> 01:11:15,602
No, you don't. Not unless you
had a brother who died too.

693
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,674
In my case, it was my sister.

694
01:11:20,968 --> 01:11:22,463
Did you love her?

695
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,499
Not as well as I
should have done.

696
01:11:37,185 --> 01:11:39,102
Never too late to free yourself.

697
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:46,491
Confession is a relief, I'm told.
A great weight lifted.

698
01:11:49,668 --> 01:11:51,908
Regret is my constant companion.

699
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:54,824
Do not let it become yours.

700
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,264
Oh No, thank you.

701
01:12:07,853 --> 01:12:11,532
Well, you've been real kind, but...

702
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:16,654
my sister Tina's
probably worried sick about me...

703
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:19,093
you know, banging on all the doors
and things...

704
01:12:20,505 --> 01:12:21,916
so I think I'd better be going.

705
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:24,184
But you haven't met your host.

706
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:25,633
Oh, are you married?

707
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:31,062
Let's say... deeply committed.

708
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:36,500
You see, I can't tell
if you're making a joke

709
01:12:37,965 --> 01:12:39,435
or if you're just...
French.

710
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:51,784
Hey, knock it off.

711
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:00,478
You stay right there.

712
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,281
I know what you are.

713
01:13:03,523 --> 01:13:04,607
Quennie.

714
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:08,200
We are not here to hurt you.

715
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:10,935
We only want to help you.

716
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:15,185
You're so very, very far from home.

717
01:13:15,995 --> 01:13:20,370
Far away from everything you
love. Everything that was comfortable.

718
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:26,496
I would never see you harmed, ever.

719
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,276
It is not your fault that your
sister is an Auror.

720
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:38,500
I wish you were working
with me now towards a

721
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:42,837
world where we wizards
are free to live openly,

722
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:46,098
and to love freely.

723
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:59,279
You are an innocent.

724
01:14:01,627 --> 01:14:03,227
So go now.

725
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,269
Leave this place.

726
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:32,359
Hey, Newt, buddy.

727
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:36,453
Tina's up here. She's all by her lonesome

728
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:39,007
and maybe you want to come
up and keep her company?

729
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,577
I've been looking for food, and
I ain't found any. So, I guess I'm

730
01:15:44,602 --> 01:15:48,838
gonna go upstairs and try my
luck in the-I dunno-the attic!

731
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:53,185
You're all right.
<i>Relaxio.</i>

732
01:15:58,992 --> 01:15:59,997
Okay.

733
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:14,665
She's responded well to the Dittany.

734
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,956
She was born to run, you see.

735
01:16:18,462 --> 01:16:21,405
I think she's just lacking in confidence

736
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,444
Mr. Scamander, have you got anything in
your case that might help revive this man?

737
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:27,819
I need to question him.

738
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,496
I think he knows who
Credence really is.

739
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:31,580
The scars on his hand suggest
an unbreakable vow...

740
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:35,269
- an unbreakable vow.
- Unbreakable vow. I noticed that too.

741
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,694
<i>Lumos.</i>

742
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,080
What was that?

743
01:16:55,085 --> 01:16:57,407
There must be a water dragon in that sewer

744
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:01,453
they carry these
parasites, you see. They...

745
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:03,932
- Jacob?
- Yeah?

746
01:17:05,617 --> 01:17:08,797
In my case, in the pocket there,
you'll find a pair of tweezers.

747
01:17:08,822 --> 01:17:09,881
Tweezers?

748
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:12,650
- They're thin and pointy...
- Thin, little pointy things.

749
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:14,371
Yes, I know what tweezers are.

750
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:19,324
You might not want to watch this...

751
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,833
I can handle it.

752
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:27,200
Come on.

753
01:17:27,616 --> 01:17:29,512
Come on.

754
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:31,726
Oh come on.

755
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:35,617
Jacob, will you take that for me?

756
01:17:38,852 --> 01:17:40,698
Calamari..

757
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:44,590
I must kill him.

758
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:45,957
Who?

759
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:47,329
Credence?

760
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:52,965
It may take him a few hours to recover.
The parasite's poison is quite strong.

761
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:56,933
I'll have to go back to the
Ministry with what I've got.

762
01:17:58,978 --> 01:18:00,737
It was nice to see you
again, Mr. Scamander.

763
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:04,018
Hey, hold on one second, will you?
Well, hold on!

764
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,275
Wait! Tina!

765
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,663
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

766
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:15,389
No, she just ran.
I don't know...

767
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:17,797
So you chase after her!

768
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:21,353
Tina. Please, just listen to me-

769
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,413
Mr. Scamander, I need to
go talk to the Ministry.

770
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:27,816
And I know how
you feel about Aurors.

771
01:18:27,817 --> 01:18:30,861
I may have been a little strong in the way
that I expressed myself in that letters.

772
01:18:30,862 --> 01:18:34,021
What was the exact phrase? “A
bunch of careerist hypocrites”?

773
01:18:34,022 --> 01:18:35,847
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

774
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:38,989
whose answer to everything that
they fear or misunderstand is “kill it”!

775
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,383
I'm an Auror and I don't...

776
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,587
Yes, and that's because
you've gone middle head!

777
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:44,999
Excuse me?

778
01:18:45,437 --> 01:18:48,277
It's an expression derived from
the three heads of the Runespoor.

779
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:49,611
The middle one is a visionary.

780
01:18:49,612 --> 01:18:54,238
Every Auror in Europe wants Credence
dead-except you. You've gone middle head.

781
01:18:55,126 --> 01:18:58,451
Who else uses that
expression, Mr. Scamander?

782
01:18:59,405 --> 01:19:00,910
I think it might just be me.

783
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,069
It's Grindelwald. He's
calling his followers.

784
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,768
It's too late.

785
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:53,967
Grindelwald's come for Credence.

786
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:56,855
He might already have him.

787
01:19:56,856 --> 01:20:00,136
It's not too late.
We can still get to him first.

788
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:03,961
Where are you going?

789
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,525
The French Ministry of Magic.

790
01:20:05,554 --> 01:20:07,760
That's the last place Credence would go!

791
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,958
There's a box hidden
at the Ministry Tina.

792
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,615
It's a box that can tell
us who Credence really is.

793
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,941
A box? What are you talking about?

794
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:16,642
Trust me.

795
01:20:19,926 --> 01:20:23,160
You wanna come out?
Just for a little while?

796
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,131
Credence.

797
01:20:37,935 --> 01:20:43,088
- Shh.
- What do you want?

798
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,831
From you?

799
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:46,645
Nothing.

800
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:51,343
For you?

801
01:20:52,626 --> 01:20:54,830
Everything I never had.

802
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,607
But what is it you want, my boy?

803
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,963
I want to know who I am.

804
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:16,435
This is where you will find
proof of your true identity.

805
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:25,068
Come to Père Lachaise tonight and
you will discover the truth.

806
01:21:43,102 --> 01:21:45,750
Father... why did you make me ...?

807
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,709
Wait!

808
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:51,560
Wait!

809
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,994
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

810
01:22:17,862 --> 01:22:19,822
Are you a ghost?

811
01:22:19,823 --> 01:22:23,662
No, no, I am alive,

812
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,822
but I am an alchemist,
and therefore immortal.

813
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:32,310
You don't look a day
over three-seventy-five.

814
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,000
Hey, sorry we didn't knock.

815
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:38,636
No, no matter.

816
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:41,196
Albus told me some
friends might be dropping in.

817
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:43,527
Nicolas Flamel.

818
01:22:47,481 --> 01:22:48,561
- Jacob Kowalski.
- Oh.

819
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,102
- I'm Sorry.
- It's alright.

820
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,440
I didn't.

821
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:56,441
Ah!

822
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:09,771
At last, we see some developments!

823
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:12,072
I've seen one of these before.

824
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:14,079
It was at the fair.

825
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,333
There was this dame there, and she
had a veil.. I gave her a nickel and

826
01:23:17,334 --> 01:23:19,777
she told me about my future.

827
01:23:19,778 --> 01:23:23,056
And she missed out on quite a bit actually.

828
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,283
Wait a minute! I know him. That's that kid.
That's Credence

829
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:35,684
Jesus.

830
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:41,455
Hey! That's Queenie! There she is

831
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:42,680
Hi, baby!

832
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,232
Where is this? Is this-is this here?

833
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,475
Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.

834
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:49,976
It lies in the cemetery of Père
Lachaise

835
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:53,467
I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.

836
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:55,509
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Flamel!

837
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,969
- Ahh!
- Ooh no. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay?

838
01:23:57,994 --> 01:24:00,014
Oh-look after
Mr. Tentacles for me.

839
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:05,146
- Oh no. I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Please, you must not go to the cemetery!

840
01:24:22,136 --> 01:24:23,833
Oh dear

841
01:24:28,054 --> 01:24:31,454
- What's happening?
- Exactly what he said would happen.

842
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:36,145
Grindelwald rallies at the cemetery
tonight, and there will be death!

843
01:24:36,146 --> 01:24:37,721
- Then you gotta go!
- What?

844
01:24:37,722 --> 01:24:40,076
I haven't seen action
in two hundred years...

845
01:24:40,177 --> 01:24:42,928
Flamel, you can do this. We believe in you.

846
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,443
The box is in the ancestral
records room, Tina.

847
01:24:54,468 --> 01:24:55,867
So, three floors down.

848
01:24:55,868 --> 01:24:57,527
Is that Polyjuice?

849
01:24:57,528 --> 01:24:59,869
Just enough to get me inside.

850
01:25:07,962 --> 01:25:09,668
- Who...?
- That's my brother, Theseus.

851
01:25:10,066 --> 01:25:11,201
He's an Auror.

852
01:25:11,502 --> 01:25:13,202
And a hugger.

853
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:15,908
What's happening?

854
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:19,831
Grindelwald's rallying. We don't know
where, but we think it's tonight.

855
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:25,767
- Be careful.
- Of course.

856
01:25:25,768 --> 01:25:28,519
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course, I'm going to be careful.

857
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:31,066
Listen, I want you to hear this
from me.

858
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:33,422
They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.

859
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:36,000
- My brother is dead. He died..
- I know. I know.

860
01:25:36,001 --> 01:25:37,147
How many times, Theseus?

861
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:39,582
And the records, the
records will prove that,

862
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:40,788
okay?

863
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,645
- They can't lie.
- Theseus.

864
01:25:48,656 --> 01:25:51,872
I want every person at
that rally arrested...

865
01:25:51,873 --> 01:25:53,673
- If they resist...
- Sir-forgive me but if we go in too heavy,

866
01:25:53,674 --> 01:25:56,104
- don't we run the risk of adding to the.
- Just do it.

867
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:15,675
I don't suppose you can Disapparate on
Ministry premises in France, can you?

868
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:16,776
No.

869
01:26:18,164 --> 01:26:19,164
Pity.

870
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,071
- Newt.
- Yes, I know. I know there's-

871
01:26:22,072 --> 01:26:24,712
<i>Emergency! Emergency! A
tracked wizard, Newt</i>

872
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:27,527
<i>Scamander, has entered
the Department of Magic!</i>

873
01:26:27,528 --> 01:26:29,028
Newt!

874
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:30,929
Newt!

875
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,250
That's your brother?

876
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:33,856
Yes, I think I may have
mentioned in my letters

877
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,426
that we have quite a
complicated relationship.

878
01:26:35,427 --> 01:26:36,315
Newt, stop!

879
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:39,356
- Does he want to kill you?
- Frequently.

880
01:26:46,315 --> 01:26:48,293
He needs to control his temper!

881
01:26:53,643 --> 01:26:56,106
I think that might have been
the best moment of my life.

882
01:27:40,893 --> 01:27:41,919
Quennie?

883
01:27:46,859 --> 01:27:48,645
Queenie, honey?

884
01:27:50,989 --> 01:27:52,141
Don't.

885
01:27:52,497 --> 01:27:54,159
Don't move.

886
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:03,773
Puis-je vous aider?

887
01:28:03,774 --> 01:28:05,774
Yes, this is Leta Lestrange.

888
01:28:09,413 --> 01:28:12,165
And-I'm her...

889
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:13,553
Fiancé.

890
01:28:16,902 --> 01:28:17,965
In you go.

891
01:28:18,769 --> 01:28:19,929
Thank you.

892
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:34,299
Tina, about that fiancée business...

893
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,638
Sorry, yeah. I should
have congratulated you.

894
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,567
- No, that's...
- Lumos.

895
01:28:41,177 --> 01:28:42,281
Lestrange.

896
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:51,024
Tina, about Leta...

897
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:52,789
Yes, I've just said, I am happy for you.

898
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:55,177
Yeah, well, I don't.
Please don't be happy.

899
01:28:58,037 --> 01:28:59,861
Uh, no, no. I'm sorry. I don't...

900
01:29:00,414 --> 01:29:03,591
Uh, obviously, I obviously I
want you to be.

901
01:29:04,415 --> 01:29:06,745
And I hear that you are now.

902
01:29:06,746 --> 01:29:08,746
Uh, which is
wonderful. Sorry.

903
01:29:10,034 --> 01:29:12,991
What I'm trying to say is,

904
01:29:12,992 --> 01:29:16,993
I don't want you to be happy
that I am happy because I'm not...

905
01:29:18,997 --> 01:29:20,633
happy.

906
01:29:21,067 --> 01:29:22,493
Or engaged.

907
01:29:24,296 --> 01:29:26,486
- What?
- It was a mistake in a stupid magazine.

908
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:30,444
My brother's marrying Leta,
June the sixth... I'm supposed

909
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:33,822
to be best man Which is
sort of mildly hilarious.

910
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:37,549
Does he think you're here to win her back?

911
01:29:38,692 --> 01:29:43,005
- Are you here to win her back?
- No, I'm here to...

912
01:29:46,366 --> 01:29:48,270
you know, your eyes really are.

913
01:29:51,368 --> 01:29:52,468
Are what?

914
01:29:53,816 --> 01:29:55,407
I'm not supposed to say.

915
01:29:59,065 --> 01:30:01,057
Newt, I read your
book, and did you...

916
01:30:01,082 --> 01:30:03,840
I still have a picture
of you-wait, did you read?

917
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:09,743
I got this...

918
01:30:09,744 --> 01:30:12,720
I mean, it's just a picture
of you from the paper.

919
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:16,278
It's interesting because
your eyes in newsprint...

920
01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:20,995
See, in reality they
have this effect in them, Tina,

921
01:30:20,996 --> 01:30:25,133
it's like fire in water, in dark water..

922
01:30:28,194 --> 01:30:30,507
I've only ever seen that.

923
01:30:33,156 --> 01:30:36,172
I've only ever seen that in...

924
01:30:39,825 --> 01:30:41,334
Salamanders?

925
01:30:45,557 --> 01:30:46,894
Come.

926
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:53,710
Lestrange.

927
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:42,217
Records moved to Lestrange
family tomb at Père Lachaise.

928
01:31:56,891 --> 01:31:58,377
Circumrota.

929
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:10,403
Hello, Newt.

930
01:32:14,979 --> 01:32:16,186
Hello, Leta

931
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,434
Hi.

932
01:32:24,758 --> 01:32:25,805
Oh no.

933
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:32,799
What kind of cats are those?

934
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,812
These aren't cats.

935
01:32:33,813 --> 01:32:36,284
They're Matagots.
They're spirit familiars.

936
01:32:36,285 --> 01:32:38,109
They guard the Ministry.

937
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,900
- But they won't hurt you...

938
01:32:42,278 --> 01:32:43,841
- unless you attack them.
- Stupefy!

939
01:32:45,762 --> 01:32:48,018
- Leta!
<i>- Reverte!</i>

940
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,060
<i>Accio!</i>

941
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:28,352
<i>Ascendio!</i>

942
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:23,322
Okay. Wait.

943
01:34:25,056 --> 01:34:26,072
Come on.

944
01:34:28,934 --> 01:34:31,013
All right. All right.

945
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:34,777
Wait.

946
01:34:49,171 --> 01:34:50,474
Move back!

947
01:34:50,475 --> 01:34:52,075
Move! Out of the way!

948
01:34:54,001 --> 01:34:57,439
If you are looking for Credence, me too.

949
01:34:57,603 --> 01:34:58,696
Stop!

950
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,123
Yusuf?

951
01:35:05,347 --> 01:35:06,624
Is that really you?

952
01:35:13,171 --> 01:35:14,563
My little sister .?

953
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:19,071
So, he's your brother?

954
01:35:21,058 --> 01:35:22,381
Who am I?

955
01:35:23,789 --> 01:35:24,716
I don't know.

956
01:35:24,717 --> 01:35:27,967
I'm tired of living with
no name and no history.

957
01:35:30,279 --> 01:35:33,041
Just tell me my
story-then you can end it.

958
01:35:33,142 --> 01:35:34,939
Your story is our story.

959
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:40,101
Our story.

960
01:35:40,325 --> 01:35:41,768
No, Yusuf.

961
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,585
My father was Mustafa Kama.

962
01:36:01,133 --> 01:36:04,963
A pure-blood of Sénégalese descent
and most accomplished.

963
01:36:05,855 --> 01:36:08,758
My mother, Laurena,

964
01:36:09,153 --> 01:36:12,229
was equally high-bred-a noted beauty.

965
01:36:13,136 --> 01:36:15,163
They were deeply in love.

966
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:21,876
They knew a man of great influence, from a
famous French pure-blood family.

967
01:36:23,014 --> 01:36:25,123
He desired her.

968
01:36:28,994 --> 01:36:33,562
Lestrange used the Imperius
Curse to seduce and abduct her.

969
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:37,639
I tried to prevent it but he attacked me.

970
01:36:39,095 --> 01:36:41,440
That was the last time I ever saw her.

971
01:36:43,768 --> 01:36:47,334
She died, giving birth to a
little girl.

972
01:36:48,404 --> 01:36:49,671
You.

973
01:36:53,379 --> 01:36:57,097
The news of her death
drove my father insane.

974
01:36:58,153 --> 01:37:04,343
With his dying breath, my father
charged me to seek revenge.

975
01:37:06,505 --> 01:37:10,103
Kill the person Lestrange
loves best in the world.

976
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:12,163
I thought at
first it would be easy.

977
01:37:12,937 --> 01:37:15,015
He had only one close relative

978
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,060
You.

979
01:37:17,477 --> 01:37:18,054
But...

980
01:37:18,126 --> 01:37:19,134
Say it.

981
01:37:20,977 --> 01:37:23,077
He never loved you.

982
01:37:26,957 --> 01:37:31,020
He remarried not three
months after her death.

983
01:37:33,477 --> 01:37:36,173
He loved her no
more than he had loved you

984
01:37:40,026 --> 01:37:41,272
But then...

985
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:44,202
his son, Corvus, was born at last.

986
01:37:44,757 --> 01:37:47,794
And that man who had never
known...

987
01:37:47,847 --> 01:37:49,692
love was filled with it.

988
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:53,778
All he cared about was little Corvus.

989
01:37:57,264 --> 01:37:58,979
So... this is the truth?

990
01:38:00,351 --> 01:38:02,288
I am Corvus Lestrange?

991
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,288
- Yes.
- No.

992
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:08,071
Realizing that Mustafa Kama's
son had sworn revenge,

993
01:38:08,072 --> 01:38:11,214
your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.

994
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:16,354
So he confided you to his servant,
who boarded a ship for America.

995
01:38:16,355 --> 01:38:19,731
- He did send Corvus to America, but...
- His servant, Irma Dugard,

996
01:38:19,732 --> 01:38:21,325
was a half-elf...

997
01:38:21,326 --> 01:38:23,001
Her magic was weak and

998
01:38:23,002 --> 01:38:25,940
therefore left no trace I could follow,

999
01:38:27,042 --> 01:38:30,509
I had only just discovered
how you had escaped

1000
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:33,460
when I received news I never expected.

1001
01:38:33,461 --> 01:38:36,389
The ship had gone down at sea.

1002
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:38,350
But you survived, didn't you?

1003
01:38:39,543 --> 01:38:42,704
Somehow, someone had
pulled you from the water!

1004
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:46,354
A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter.

1005
01:38:46,355 --> 01:38:49,602
Return, great avenger
with wings from the water.

1006
01:38:49,603 --> 01:38:52,090
There, stands the despairing daughter.

1007
01:38:52,256 --> 01:38:56,032
You are the winged raven returned
from the sea, but I

1008
01:38:56,033 --> 01:39:00,008
I am the avenger of my family's ruin.

1009
01:39:02,613 --> 01:39:03,768
I pity you, Corvus,

1010
01:39:05,768 --> 01:39:06,893
but you must die.

1011
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:10,293
Corvus Lestrange is already dead.
I killed him.

1012
01:39:17,393 --> 01:39:18,393
Accio.

1013
01:39:35,796 --> 01:39:39,011
My father owned a very strange family tree.

1014
01:39:42,497 --> 01:39:44,635
It only recorded the men...

1015
01:39:48,627 --> 01:39:51,467
The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.

1016
01:39:54,316 --> 01:39:55,399
Beautiful.

1017
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:58,947
Separate.

1018
01:40:01,557 --> 01:40:03,997
My father sent me to
America, along Corvus..

1019
01:40:09,951 --> 01:40:13,498
Irma was to pose as a grandmother
with two grandchildren...

1020
01:40:18,433 --> 01:40:21,473
Corvus never stopped crying.

1021
01:40:39,477 --> 01:40:41,103
I never wanted to hurt him.

1022
01:40:46,854 --> 01:40:49,060
I only wanted to be free of him

1023
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,310
Just for a moment.

1024
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:58,310
Just a single moment.

1025
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:10,143
They want us to put on life jackets!

1026
01:42:09,101 --> 01:42:11,677
You didn't mean to do it, Leta.

1027
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:15,200
So it wasn't your fault.

1028
01:42:18,352 --> 01:42:19,458
Oh, Newt.

1029
01:42:23,726 --> 01:42:26,755
You never met a monster you couldn't love.

1030
01:42:31,184 --> 01:42:35,206
Leta, do you know who Credence really is?

1031
01:42:36,687 --> 01:42:39,527
Did you know, when
you swapped him?

1032
01:42:39,528 --> 01:42:40,907
No.

1033
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:06,023
Queenie?

1034
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,813
They're pure-bloods.

1035
01:43:33,512 --> 01:43:35,677
They kill the likes of us for sport!

1036
01:43:38,575 --> 01:43:40,195
- Quennie.
- Jacob.

1037
01:43:40,576 --> 01:43:42,951
Honey, you're here! Hi!

1038
01:43:42,952 --> 01:43:44,140
Hi, dear, do not.

1039
01:43:44,962 --> 01:43:47,217
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,

1040
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:49,472
I never should have done it, I love you so
much.

1041
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:51,810
- And you know that I love you, right?
- Yeah.

1042
01:43:51,811 --> 01:43:55,310
- Good, now let's get the hell out of here.
- Oh, wait. Wait a second.

1043
01:43:57,810 --> 01:44:00,752
I just thought maybe we could hear him
first.

1044
01:44:00,753 --> 01:44:03,474
You know, just listen, that's all.

1045
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:05,841
What are you talking about?

1046
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:12,343
It's a trap.

1047
01:44:12,693 --> 01:44:13,745
Yeah.

1048
01:44:14,938 --> 01:44:18,997
Queenie-the family
tree-it's all been bait.

1049
01:44:20,073 --> 01:44:22,386
We have to find a way
out of here, right now

1050
01:44:23,673 --> 01:44:25,294
You go find the others.

1051
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:26,535
What are you gonna do?

1052
01:44:27,196 --> 01:44:28,279
I'll think of something.

1053
01:45:17,117 --> 01:45:22,747
My brothers, my sisters, my friends:

1054
01:45:24,204 --> 01:45:28,155
the great gift of your applause
is not for me...

1055
01:45:29,069 --> 01:45:30,854
No. It is for yourselves.

1056
01:45:33,636 --> 01:45:36,032
You came today
because of a craving

1057
01:45:37,353 --> 01:45:39,102
and a knowledge

1058
01:45:40,852 --> 01:45:44,292
that the old
ways serve us no longer.

1059
01:45:47,065 --> 01:45:51,175
You come today because you crave
something new.

1060
01:45:52,768 --> 01:45:54,518
Something different.

1061
01:45:56,794 --> 01:46:02,786
It is said that I hate Les Non-Magiques,

1062
01:46:02,787 --> 01:46:04,325
The Muggle.

1063
01:46:04,409 --> 01:46:05,760
The No-Maj.

1064
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:08,561
The Can't-Spells.

1065
01:46:11,061 --> 01:46:14,558
I do not hate them. I do not.

1066
01:46:16,768 --> 01:46:18,552
For I do not fight out of hatred.

1067
01:46:21,264 --> 01:46:27,185
I say the Muggles are not lesser, but
other.

1068
01:46:27,935 --> 01:46:32,187
Not worthless,
but of other value.

1069
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:36,820
Not disposable,

1070
01:46:36,821 --> 01:46:39,204
but of a different disposition.

1071
01:46:39,352 --> 01:46:42,736
Magic blooms

1072
01:46:42,737 --> 01:46:46,299
only in rare souls.

1073
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:57,327
Oh, and what a world we could
make, for all of humanity...

1074
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,157
We who live for freedom,

1075
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:02,593
for truth.

1076
01:47:04,569 --> 01:47:06,522
And for love.

1077
01:47:16,425 --> 01:47:18,303
It isn't illegal to listen to him!

1078
01:47:19,249 --> 01:47:21,527
Use minimum of force on the crowd.

1079
01:47:22,857 --> 01:47:24,749
We mustn't be what he says we are!

1080
01:47:30,733 --> 01:47:35,231
The moment has come to share
my vision of the future.

1081
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:40,169
That awaits if we do not rise up

1082
01:47:42,115 --> 01:47:46,652
and take our rightful place in the world.

1083
01:48:30,943 --> 01:48:32,806
Not another war.

1084
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:41,979
That is what we are fighting!

1085
01:48:43,047 --> 01:48:44,699
That is the enemy.

1086
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,942
Their arrogance.

1087
01:48:49,098 --> 01:48:50,939
Their power lust.

1088
01:48:53,151 --> 01:48:54,814
Their barbarity.

1089
01:48:56,436 --> 01:49:00,627
How long will it take before they
turn their weapons on us?

1090
01:49:02,626 --> 01:49:05,434
Do nothing when I speak of this.

1091
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,838
You must remain calm

1092
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,017
and contain your emotions.

1093
01:49:16,343 --> 01:49:18,572
There are Aurors here among us.

1094
01:49:28,647 --> 01:49:31,536
Come closer, brother wizards! Join us.

1095
01:49:32,798 --> 01:49:34,142
Do nothing.

1096
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:36,809
No force.

1097
01:49:52,582 --> 01:49:55,614
They have killed many of my followers.

1098
01:49:56,024 --> 01:49:57,536
It is true.

1099
01:49:59,102 --> 01:50:03,270
They confined me
tortured me in New York.

1100
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:09,682
They had struck down their fellow
witches and wizards...

1101
01:50:10,478 --> 01:50:15,850
For the simple crime of seeking the truth.

1102
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:18,402
For wanting freedom...

1103
01:50:23,304 --> 01:50:26,948
Your anger, your desire
for revenge is natural.

1104
01:50:30,563 --> 01:50:33,803
No!

1105
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,518
Take this young warrior back to her family.

1106
01:51:14,102 --> 01:51:17,966
Disapparate. Leave.
Go forth from

1107
01:51:17,991 --> 01:51:21,602
this place and spread the word.

1108
01:51:22,685 --> 01:51:26,030
It is not we who are violent.

1109
01:52:14,426 --> 01:52:18,395
Aurors, join me in this circle.

1110
01:52:19,964 --> 01:52:24,333
Pledge to me your eternal allegiance.

1111
01:52:24,868 --> 01:52:26,231
Or die.

1112
01:52:26,529 --> 01:52:29,014
Only here shall you know freedom.

1113
01:52:29,015 --> 01:52:32,070
Only here shall you know
yourself.

1114
01:52:39,322 --> 01:52:40,930
Play by the rules.

1115
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:42,988
No cheating, children.

1116
01:52:48,536 --> 01:52:50,246
He knows who I am.

1117
01:52:50,474 --> 01:52:54,201
He knows what you were
born, not who you are...

1118
01:52:54,202 --> 01:52:56,202
Credence!

1119
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:12,545
Queenie. You gotta wake up!

1120
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:17,463
Jacob, he's the answer.

1121
01:53:17,889 --> 01:53:20,181
- He wants what we wants.
- No, no, no.

1122
01:53:20,182 --> 01:53:21,182
Why?

1123
01:53:30,475 --> 01:53:32,807
This has all been for you, Credence.

1124
01:53:36,354 --> 01:53:37,540
Walk with me.

1125
01:53:39,643 --> 01:53:41,142
Honey, no!

1126
01:53:41,143 --> 01:53:42,971
Walk with me!

1127
01:53:44,915 --> 01:53:46,324
You're crazy.

1128
01:53:50,304 --> 01:53:51,309
Not!

1129
01:53:51,310 --> 01:53:54,030
No! Queenie, don't do it!

1130
01:54:05,227 --> 01:54:06,685
Queenie!

1131
01:54:23,552 --> 01:54:25,121
Mr. Scamander.

1132
01:54:25,181 --> 01:54:29,149
Do you think Dumbledore will mourn for you?

1133
01:54:39,443 --> 01:54:42,079
Grindelwald! Stop!

1134
01:54:49,566 --> 01:54:50,666
Leta...

1135
01:55:00,925 --> 01:55:03,005
This one I believe I know.

1136
01:55:04,169 --> 01:55:05,905
Leta Lestrange.

1137
01:55:07,185 --> 01:55:09,857
Despised entirely amongst wizards.

1138
01:55:09,858 --> 01:55:13,145
Unloved, mistreated...

1139
01:55:14,237 --> 01:55:15,730
yet brave.

1140
01:55:16,873 --> 01:55:18,783
So very brave.

1141
01:55:23,475 --> 01:55:25,106
Time to come home.

1142
01:55:43,257 --> 01:55:44,516
I love you.

1143
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:54,601
Go!

1144
01:55:55,927 --> 01:55:56,931
Go!

1145
01:56:20,579 --> 01:56:22,151
I hate Paris.

1146
01:57:01,994 --> 01:57:05,495
Together! In a circle,
your wand into the earth.

1147
01:57:05,765 --> 01:57:08,179
Or all Paris will be lost!

1148
01:57:15,268 --> 01:57:16,368
<i>Finite!</i>

1149
01:57:18,349 --> 01:57:19,492
<i>Finite!</i>

1150
01:57:19,493 --> 01:57:20,860
<i>Finite!</i>

1151
01:57:22,262 --> 01:57:23,292
<i>Finite!</i>

1152
01:59:33,185 --> 01:59:34,745
I've chosen my side.

1153
01:59:55,663 --> 02:00:01,543
Oh come here. I've got you.
I've got you.

1154
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:48,159
I think it's best if he
speaks to him alone.

1155
02:01:22,227 --> 02:01:25,273
Is he frightened of me still?

1156
02:01:25,274 --> 02:01:26,546
You need to be careful ..

1157
02:01:27,904 --> 02:01:30,224
He's not sure he made the right choice.

1158
02:01:31,464 --> 02:01:34,984
Be very gentle with him.

1159
02:01:40,185 --> 02:01:42,685
I have a gift for you, my boy.

1160
02:01:54,592 --> 02:01:58,412
Is it true about Leta?

1161
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,557
Yes.

1162
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,143
I'm so sorry.

1163
02:02:11,893 --> 02:02:13,965
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

1164
02:02:16,676 --> 02:02:18,987
You swore not to fight each other.

1165
02:02:26,667 --> 02:02:28,960
How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get?

1166
02:02:33,418 --> 02:02:37,641
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand the
nature of things he considers simple...

1167
02:02:53,817 --> 02:02:55,046
Can you destroy it?

1168
02:02:55,247 --> 02:02:56,309
Maybe.

1169
02:02:58,583 --> 02:02:59,612
Maybe.

1170
02:03:05,805 --> 02:03:07,573
Would he like a cup of tea?

1171
02:03:08,933 --> 02:03:10,551
He'll have some milk.

1172
02:03:12,841 --> 02:03:14,805
Hide the teaspoons.

1173
02:03:20,545 --> 02:03:25,458
You have suffered the most
heinous of betrayals,

1174
02:03:25,459 --> 02:03:29,674
most purposely bestowed
upon you by your

1175
02:03:29,699 --> 02:03:33,443
own blood. Your own
flesh and blood.

1176
02:03:33,444 --> 02:03:36,292
And just as he has celebrated your torment,

1177
02:03:38,763 --> 02:03:42,459
your brother seeks to
destroy you.

1178
02:04:03,407 --> 02:04:07,444
There is a legend in your family that
a phoenix will come to any member

1179
02:04:07,445 --> 02:04:09,143
who is in dire need.

1180
02:04:16,519 --> 02:04:18,672
It is your birthright, my boy.

1181
02:04:23,264 --> 02:04:25,403
As is

1182
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:28,534
the name I now restore to you.

1183
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:32,475
Aurelius.

1184
02:04:34,141 --> 02:04:36,995
Aurelius Dumbledore.

1185
02:04:38,673 --> 02:04:42,915
We will go down in history together
as we remake this world.
