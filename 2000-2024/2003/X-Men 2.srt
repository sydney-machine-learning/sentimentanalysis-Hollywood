1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,543
Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence...

2
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,628
they have been
regarded with fear...

3
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,798
suspicion, often hatred.

4
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,134
Across the planet, debate rages.

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,637
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain...

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,140
or simply a new species
of humanity...

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,310
fighting for their share
of the world?

8
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,396
Either way,
it is an historical fact:

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,984
Sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.

10
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,278
"We are not enemies, but friends.

11
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,280
"We must not be enemies.

12
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,282
"Though passion
may have strained...

13
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,619
it must not break the bonds
of our affection. "

14
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:05,833
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,418
It's one of my favorites.

16
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,587
So, if you’ll please
have your tickets ready...

17
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,673
we can begin the tour.

18
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,390
Jackie, could you clear
my schedule this evening?

19
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,393
I wanna have dinner with
my son. Yes, Mr. President.

20
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,090
Excuse me, sir.
Are you lost?

21
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,436
Perimeter breach
at visitor's checkpoint.

22
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,567
Multiple subjects.

23
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,447
Mr. President, security breach. Jackie,
leave. Let's get him out to the car.

24
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,201
Exit's not clear. We don't
know how many there are.

25
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,286
Post five. Secure.

26
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,089
- There's something in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

27
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,342
Negative! Not clear!

28
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,017
- It's outside the oval office.
- Lock this place down!

29
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,328
- Don't shoot!
- There!

30
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,854
My God.

31
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,226
Neanderthals. We once believed
that they were wiped out...

32
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,896
by years of conflict with a much
more advanced branch of humanity...

33
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,898
called Cro-Magnon man.

34
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,900
But recent research
into our own DNA...

35
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,654
suggests that these two species
may have interbred...

36
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,490
evolving into modern humans.

37
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,492
In other words, into what?
Us.

38
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,537
Us. Right.

39
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,498
Artie, not here.

40
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,923
Come on.
Pay attention.

41
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,940
Makes me insane
when she does this.

42
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,736
What are you looking at, you sick—

43
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,155
Busted my lip.

44
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,199
- I have cancer.
- To the shelter!

45
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,117
- No!
- Hi.

46
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,078
They're gonna kill—

47
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,623
What's wrong with this?
It doesn't work.

48
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,213
Jean? You okay?
Yeah.

49
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,965
Yeah, I'm fine.

50
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,927
It's just, uh—
just a headache.

51
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,306
It's not just a headache,
is it?

52
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,309
Listen, I— I wasn't really
sure how to say this...

53
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,270
but ever since Liberty
Island, you've been— Scott.

54
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,314
You've been different.

55
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,274
My telepathy's been off lately.

56
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,778
I can't seem to focus. I can hear
everything. It's not just your telepathy.

57
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,740
A month ago, you had to concentrate just to
levitate a book or a chair across the room.

58
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,618
Now, when you have a nightmare,
the entire bedroom shakes.

59
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,831
My dreams are getting worse.

60
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,000
Scott.

61
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,630
I keep feeling something terrible
is about to happen.

62
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,681
I would never let anything
happen to you.

63
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,642
Hey. Have you guys
seen Bobby and Rogue?

64
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,479
Something's happening
in the food court.

65
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,065
My brother asked you a simple
question. Why are you being such a dick?

66
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,150
Yeah, why are you
being such a dick?

67
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,904
Because I can.

68
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,990
Can I have a light?

69
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,119
Hmm.

70
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,246
- Sorry. I can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

71
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,707
- Why don't
you stop showing off?

72
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,918
For her? I can't help it if your
girlfriend's getting excited.

73
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,796
- I don't think she's getting excited.
- Trying to have a good time.

74
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,465
I think you're the only one
having a good time.

75
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,385
Hey!

76
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,346
That's real cute, man.
What are you gonna do?

77
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,059
Suddenly,
you're not so tough.

78
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,054
Hello? Honey, can you hear me?

79
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,607
Bobby, what did you do?

80
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,109
I didn't do this.
No.

81
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,528
I did.

82
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,624
And the next time you
feel like showing off, don't.

83
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:15,173
Breaking news. We're coming
to you live from Washington...

84
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,051
where there's been an attack in
the Oval Office of the White House.

85
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,595
Details are still coming in,
but we have been informed...

86
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,598
that the president and
vice-president were not harmed.

87
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,267
Sources say the attack
involved one or more mutants.

88
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,395
I think
it's time to leave, Professor.

89
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,231
Authorities have closed off-
I think you're right.

90
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,779
Yearrgh! Unh!

91
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,285
My opinion?
Magneto's behind this.

92
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,287
No. I don't
think so, Scott.

93
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,332
While Eric is capable of organizing
something like this from prison...

94
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,334
for him
it would be irrational.

95
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,336
It would only hurt his goal
of mutant prosperity.

96
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,880
You mean superiority.
You're right.

97
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,000
If Eric had his way—

98
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,634
Of course, you know how
the government will respond.

99
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,886
They'll reintroduce
the Registration Act.

100
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,141
Or worse. The president could
declare a state of emergency.

101
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,727
Place every mutant
in the country under arrest.

102
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,895
Do you think the assassin
was working alone?

103
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,399
Well, we'll only know that if we
find him before the authorities do.

104
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,651
I've been trying to
track him using Cerebro...

105
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,239
but his movements
are inexplicably erratic.

106
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,867
When I have
more exact coordinates...

107
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,036
Storm, Jean, I'll need you to take
the jet and try and pick him up.

108
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,417
It was close, wasn't it?

109
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,378
Closer than anyone's admitted.

110
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,089
What do you need, William?
Just your authorization...

111
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,467
for a special operation.

112
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,429
Uh, no, thank you,
Mr. President.

113
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,265
And somehow I thought you were
here to talk about school reform.

114
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,642
Funny you should say that,
Mr. President.

115
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,229
Senator.
Mr. President.

116
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,539
Thank you for having me.

117
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,941
Senator Kelly, this is
Colonel William Stryker.

118
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,759
How do you do?

119
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,737
His department has been dealing
with the mutant phenomenon...

120
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,281
since before my time.

121
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,534
As I recall, you were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act, Senator.

122
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,871
It seems your ideas on the mutant
problem have changed recently.

123
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,123
For the best,
I hope.

124
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,126
So, what are you proposing,
Mr. Stryker?

125
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,504
Uh, may I,
Mr. President?

126
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,103
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility...

127
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,607
in the Salem region
of upstate New York.

128
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,651
Where did you
get this information?

129
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,320
Interrogation of one of
the mutant terrorists...

130
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,447
from the Liberty Island
incident.

131
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,908
Eric? Eric Lehnsherr?

132
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,161
You have access to him?
Magneto. Yes.

133
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,414
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

134
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,297
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

135
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,262
What the hell is that?
Ajet.

136
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,473
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know...

137
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,144
but it comes up
out of the basketball court.

138
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,529
If we’d been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr. President, before this incident—

139
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,948
All right. Listen.

140
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,246
William, you enter,
you detain, you question...

141
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,582
but the last thing
we need to see...

142
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,585
is the body of a mutant kid
on the 6:00 news.

143
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,304
Mr. Stryker.
Senator Kelly.

144
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,558
This is Yuriko,
my personal assistant.

145
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,603
Quite a handshake.
What can I do for you?

146
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,440
Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison. I'd
like to arrange a visit if possible.

147
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,567
It isn't a petting zoo,
Senator.

148
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,569
In this conflict,
he is the enemy.

149
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,906
You're just a spectator. So why
don't you sit this one out, all right?

150
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,410
Conflict? Mr. Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

151
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,418
I was piloting black-ops missions
in the jungles of North Vietnam...

152
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,755
while you were sucking on your
mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly.

153
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,757
Don't lecture me
about war.

154
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,009
This already is a war.

155
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,522
You're dead. You're so dead.
You're dead.

156
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,863
I—I don't
wanna hurt you.

157
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,951
I'm not afraid.

158
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,995
Hey.

159
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,721
Logan!
It's Logan.

160
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,100
You miss me, kid?

161
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,519
Not really.
Mm. How you doing?

162
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,063
I'm okay. How are you? Who's this?

163
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,400
Oh, this is Bobby. He's
my— I'm her boyfriend.

164
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,902
Call me Iceman.

165
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,158
Right.
Boyfriend?

166
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,577
So how do you guys—

167
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,872
Well, we're still
working on that.

168
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,917
Look who's come back.
Just in time.

169
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,254
For what?
We need a baby-sitter.

170
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,841
Baby-sitter? Nice to
see you again, Logan.

171
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:54,429
- Hi, Logan.
- Hi, Jean.

172
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,182
Uh, I should go
and get the jet ready.

173
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,768
Yeah, well,
it was good to meet you.

174
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,937
Come on. Let's go. Bye, Logan.

175
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,898
I'll see you later.
- Okay.

176
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,113
Storm and I
are heading to Boston.

177
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,115
We won't be gone long.

178
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,452
The professor wants us to track down
a mutant who attacked the president.

179
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,454
So it was a mutant?

180
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,539
You'll be here
when we get back—

181
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,542
unless you plan
on running off again.

182
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,629
Well, I can probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

183
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,592
Find what you were
looking for, Logan?

184
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,635
More or less.

185
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,430
I'll see you boys later.

186
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,224
- Be safe, okay?
- You too.

187
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,852
- Bye.
- See ya.

188
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,648
Aren't you gonna
welcome me home?

189
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,903
Your bike needs gas.

190
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,155
Then fill her up.

191
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,718
Mr. Laurio.

192
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,720
How long
can we keep this up?

193
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,016
How long is your sentence?

194
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,561
Forever. Not necessarily
forever, Mr. Lehnsherr.

195
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,064
Just until
I've got all that I need.

196
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,274
Mr. Stryker.
How kind of you to visit.

197
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,072
Have you come back to make sure the
tax-payers' dollars are keeping me comfortable?

198
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,869
Ohh!

199
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,599
Done. You can go.

200
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,937
Now...

201
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,900
Mr. Lehnsherr...

202
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,531
I'd like to have one final talk...

203
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,284
about the house
that Xavier built...

204
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,453
and the machine
called Cerebro.

205
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,507
Logan, my tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding...

206
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,386
continue smoking that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days...

207
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,722
under the belief that
you're a six-year-old girl.

208
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,851
- You'd do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

209
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,812
Welcome back.

210
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,741
Ooh.

211
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,999
You want me to leave?

212
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,627
No. Just don't move.

213
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,345
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

214
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,309
White lights are humans.

215
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,731
And these
are the mutants.

216
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,945
Through Cerebro,
I'm connected to them.

217
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,197
And they to me.

218
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,285
You see, Logan...

219
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,621
We're not as alone
as you think.

220
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,376
I found the base
at Alkali Lake.

221
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,462
There was
nothing there.

222
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:01,300
The broken line represents the path of
the mutant who attacked the president.

223
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,137
I've been finding it difficult
to get a lock on him.

224
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,599
Well, can't you just
concentrate harder?

225
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,227
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

226
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,856
There.

227
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,484
Looks like
he's finally stopped running.

228
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,460
I need you
to read my mind again.

229
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,423
Logan...

230
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,515
I'm afraid the results
will be the same as before.

231
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,464
We had a deal.

232
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:53,978
The mind is not a box that can
be simply unlocked and opened.

233
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,952
It's a beehive with a
million different compartments.

234
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,190
Spare me the lecture.

235
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,403
I have no doubt that your amnesia,
your adamantium skeleton, the claws...

236
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,405
are all somehow connected.

237
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,407
But, Logan...

238
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:11,454
sometimes the mind needs to
discover things for itself.

239
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,165
I promise you we'll
talk again when I return.

240
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:19,420
Oh. If you will be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight...

241
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,173
Scott and I are going to
visit an old friend.

242
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,857
I'm sending coordinates of where the
mutant seems to have settled for now.

243
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,610
Soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.

244
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,612
Let's hope
he cooperates.

245
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,531
Yes. For his sake.
Good luck.

246
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,642
Stryker, William.

247
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,085
What are you
doing in here?

248
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,338
Estoy tirando la basura.

249
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,507
Garbage.

250
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,515
These are
the coordinates.

251
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,745
He's a teleporter.

252
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,832
- Must be why the professor
had trouble locking onto him.

253
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,586
We're not here to hurt you!

254
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,631
We just wanna talk!

255
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,722
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

256
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,224
Sure you don't wanna come down?

257
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,417
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

258
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,795
Are you?

259
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,214
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

260
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,758
Now why would people
have gotten that impression?

261
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:03,097
What's your name?
Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

262
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,853
There was so much shooting...

263
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,855
such fear...

264
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,941
and then
there was only pain.

265
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,946
I could see it all happening...

266
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,532
but I couldn't stop myself.

267
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,118
It was like a bad dream.

268
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,955
Perhaps He is testing me.

269
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,876
And before you were
in the White House...

270
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,878
what do you remember?

271
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,923
Nothing. I was here.

272
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,928
Jean.

273
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,098
I'd rather get him
back to the professor.

274
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,975
The professor?

275
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,649
Did you do these yourself?

276
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,694
Yes.

277
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,951
And what about this?

278
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,223
I need you
to read my mind again.

279
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,684
I'm afraid the results
will be the same as before.

280
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,020
He'll be indestructible.
His entire skeleton—

281
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:38,525
Adamantium. Sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

282
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,446
Wolverine.

283
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,157
No memory. He'll have no memory.

284
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,213
A dozen tourists in
the White House during the attack...

285
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,215
are still being
held for questioning.

286
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,676
Best tasting food.
A machine that's so darn easy—

287
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,223
...president will
address the nation—

288
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,773
For the White House assassin,
following hundreds of-

289
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,358
Can't sleep?

290
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,196
- How can you tell?
- 'Cause you're awake.

291
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,491
Right. How about you?

292
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,785
I don't sleep.

293
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,876
Hey.

294
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,962
Doesn't anybody
sleep around here?

295
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,047
Apparently not.

296
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,885
Got any beer?
This is a school.

297
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,887
So that's a "no"?
Yeah, that's a "no. "

298
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,889
Got anything other
than chocolate milk?

299
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,101
There should be some soda
in that small cupboard.

300
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,242
Thanks.
No problem.

301
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,003
I'll take him from here.

302
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,882
It's all right, Scott.

303
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,509
Nice shades.
Thanks.

304
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,417
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

305
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,377
Sorry, Eric. Not today.

306
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,339
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

307
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,093
The assassination attempt
on the president—

308
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,263
What do you know about it? Nothing.

309
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,641
Only what I read
in the papers.

310
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,353
You really shouldn't
have to ask, Charles.

311
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,688
What's happened to you?

312
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,275
I've had frequent visits
from William Stryker.

313
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,195
You remember him,
don't you?

314
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,615
William Stryker.

315
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,994
His son, Jason, was once a
student of yours, wasn't he?

316
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,121
Yes. Years ago.

317
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,959
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to help him...

318
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,294
at least not in the way
that his father wanted.

319
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,797
And now you think
that taking in the Wolverine...

320
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,509
will make up for your failure
with Stryker's son.

321
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,724
How long you been here?
Couple years.

322
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,978
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

323
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,775
Actually, my parents
think this is a prep school.

324
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,945
Oh, I see.

325
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,699
I suppose lots of prep schools have
their own dorms, campuses— Jets.

326
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,079
So you and Rogue, huh? Yeah.

327
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,249
It's not what you think.
I'd like it to be, but it's just—

328
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,919
It's just that it's not easy...

329
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,296
when you wanna be
closer to someone...

330
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,300
but you can't.

331
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,722
You know, I've seen how
you look at Dr. Grey.

332
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,601
Excuse me?
Nothing.

333
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,229
You haven't told him
about his past, have you?

334
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,523
I've put him on the path.

335
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,192
Logan's mind is still fragile.

336
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,278
Is it?

337
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,948
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men...

338
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,117
old friend?

339
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,622
Eric, what have you done?

340
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,585
I'm sorry, Charles.

341
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,297
I couldn't help it.

342
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,425
What have you told Stryker?

343
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,637
Everything.

344
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,812
The war has begun.

345
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:35,822
Scott! You should've killed
me when you had the chance!

346
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,566
But now and then...

347
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,610
every mother needs to get away.

348
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,947
Without her,
the babies are helpless.

349
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:21,409
Sensing danger,
the mother rat races home.

350
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,871
The babies can't
even see the killer.

351
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,999
And someone uninvited
is coming to dinner.

352
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,462
She arrives too late
for one baby.

353
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,507
The centipede was deadly.

354
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,177
Hi.

355
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,029
- What is it?
- Shh, shh.

356
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,941
You picked
the wrong house, bub.

357
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,815
You all right?

358
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,118
Stay here.

359
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,214
Come on!
Run!

360
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,492
Move, move, move!

361
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,626
This way.
Let's go. Come on!

362
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,718
Go, go, go!

363
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,227
Run!

364
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,855
Run! John! Hey. Where's Rogue?

365
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,649
I don't know.
I gotta find her.

366
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,234
Hey!

367
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,904
Come on!
Here. Take her.

368
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,157
Hurry!

369
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,079
Go on. Get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

370
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,081
Come on.
Let's go! Come on!

371
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,879
Hey. Take him.
He's stunned.

372
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,964
I can help you.
Help them.

373
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,864
Rogue!
Bobby!

374
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,949
This way.

375
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,005
Come on. Everybody,
follow me up here.

376
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,931
Move! Move!
Go! Go!

377
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,607
Come on.

378
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,873
Let's go.

379
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,835
Come on. This way.

380
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,634
This is it.

381
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,846
Logan!

382
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,889
You wanna shoot me?
Shoot me!

383
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,016
Don't shoot him!

384
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,352
Not yet.

385
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,897
Wolverine?

386
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,358
Well, I must admit, this is
certainly the last place...

387
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,694
I'd expect to find you.

388
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,530
How long has it been?
Fifteen years?

389
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,033
You haven't
changed one bit.

390
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,495
Me, on the other hand—

391
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,833
Nature.

392
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,340
Wait! Wait! You guys, we gotta do
something. They're gonna kill him.

393
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,885
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby!

394
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,430
Please.

395
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,933
I didn't realize Xavier
was taking in animals—

396
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,102
even animals
as unique as you.

397
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,271
Who are you?

398
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,275
Don't you remember?

399
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,459
No! No!

400
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,422
Logan, come on.
Let's go.

401
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:06,189
Logan.
Go! I'll be fine.

402
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,441
But we won't.

403
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,993
Go. Keep going.

404
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,105
All right. Get in. Get in! I'm driving.

405
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,857
Hey. Maybe next time.

406
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,487
This is Cyclops's car.

407
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,198
Oh, yeah?

408
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,218
What the hell
was that back there?

409
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,265
Stryker. His name is Stryker.

410
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,392
Who is he?

411
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,644
I can't remember.

412
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,646
Zone one clear.

413
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,024
Roger that.

414
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,073
Here. This is yours.

415
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,294
I don't like
uncomfortable silences.

416
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,421
What are you doing?

417
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,055
I don't think
that's the CD player.

418
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,601
Whoa.

419
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,439
Sit back.

420
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,262
Where we going?

421
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:14,609
Storm and Jean are in
Boston. We'll head that way.

422
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,905
- My parents live in Boston.
- Good.

423
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,589
Sergeant?

424
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,842
Most of the mutants escaped through a series
of tunnels that weren't in our schematics.

425
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,803
We have several in custody.

426
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,763
How many?
Six, sir.

427
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,291
Welcome, Professor.

428
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,648
Take what we need, gentlemen.

429
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,236
Look, I just think all this
anti-mutant protesting...

430
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,948
underscores the genuine growing
concern among most Americans.

431
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,950
I think mutant registration—
But why stop there?

432
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,495
Maybe it would be easier to
round up mutants by the truckload.

433
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,290
Or maybe you'd like all-out
war, Mr. Shaw. Oh, please.

434
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,917
Turn that shit off, Lou.

435
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,503
Lot on your mind?

436
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,468
Mr. Laurio?

437
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,847
I'm Grace.

438
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,026
You want another beer?

439
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,321
Of course you do.

440
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,582
You're really aggressive.
Yes, I am.

441
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,087
Oh, I— I've never hooked up
with a girl like you before.

442
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,381
I know.

443
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,677
It's, uh, kinda dirty in here,
don't you think?

444
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,514
That's the idea. Velcro.

445
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,725
Nice.
Bottom's up.

446
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,019
I certainly hope so.

447
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,120
Bottom's up.

448
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,768
- William.
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.

449
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,231
I call it
the neural inhibitor.

450
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,484
It keeps you outta here.

451
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,863
What have you
done with Scott?

452
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,992
Don't worry. I'm just giving
him a little reeducation.

453
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,328
Of course, you know
all about that, don't you?

454
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,455
William, you wanted me
to cure your son.

455
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,083
But mutation is not a
disease. You're lying!

456
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,671
You were more frightened
of him than I was.

457
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:08,050
You know, just one year after
Jason returned from your school...

458
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,052
my wife—

459
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,055
You see he resented us.

460
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,641
He blamed us
for his condition.

461
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,269
So he would
toy with our minds...

462
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,439
projecting visions
and scenarios into our brains.

463
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,776
Well, my wife,
in the end—

464
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,071
She took a power drill
to her left temple...

465
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,824
in an attempt
to bore the images out.

466
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,495
My boy, the great illusionist.

467
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,463
For someone
who hates mutants...

468
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,466
you certainly keep
some strange company.

469
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,177
Oh, they serve
their purpose...

470
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,472
as long as
they can be controlled.

471
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,104
You arranged the attack
on the president.

472
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,734
You didn't even
have to read my mind.

473
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,532
You know, I've been working with
mutants as long as you have, Xavier...

474
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,701
but the most frustrating thing
I've learned...

475
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,663
is that nobody really knows
how many even exist...

476
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,873
or how to find them—

477
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,169
except you.

478
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,047
Unfortunately, this little potion
won't work on you, will it?

479
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,383
You're much too powerful
for that.

480
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,303
Instead, we'll go
right to the source.

481
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,892
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.

482
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:46,148
The fluid secreted by his brain
acts as a mind-controlling agent.

483
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,360
But that's only
where it begins.

484
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,404
Jason.

485
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,032
Oh, my God, William.
This is your son.

486
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,326
What have you done to him? No, Charles!

487
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,913
My son is dead...

488
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,290
just like the rest of you.

489
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,525
Mom? Dad? Ronny?

490
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,863
Is anybody home?

491
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,948
I'll try and find you
some clothes.

492
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,160
Don't burn anything.

493
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,383
Hey. I found some of
my mom's old clothes.

494
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,635
I think they're from
before I was born.

495
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,140
Groovy.

496
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:13,235
Hello.

497
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,113
Come on, Jean.
Where are you?

498
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,147
These are
my grandmother's.

499
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,525
Thanks.

500
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,695
You won't hurt me.

501
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,332
Wow.

502
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,969
I'm— I'm sorry.

503
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,431
It's okay.

504
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,354
Mmm.

505
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,378
Hey, Ronny. Next time you—

506
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,465
Who the hell are you?

507
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,759
Uh—
Bobby.

508
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,387
Honey, aren't you
supposed to be at school?

509
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:09,268
Bobby, who is this guy?
- Uh, this is Professor Logan.

510
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,943
There's something I need to tell you.

511
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,841
You're clear.

512
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,817
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?

513
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,241
There's something different
about you, Mr. Laurio.

514
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,244
Yeah. I was having
a good day.

515
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,997
No. No, it's not that.

516
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,335
- Sit down.
- No.

517
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,587
Sit your ass down.

518
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,049
What could it be?

519
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,010
What are you doing?

520
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,014
Ahh. There it is.

521
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,352
Too much iron in your blood.

522
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,249
Mr. Laurio, never trust
a beautiful woman...

523
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,502
especially one
who's interested in you.

524
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,926
So, uh...

525
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,512
when did you first know
you were a—

526
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,266
A-
A mutant?

527
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,728
Would you cut that out?

528
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,813
You have to understand,

529
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,149
We thought Bobby was going
to a school for the gifted.

530
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,131
Bobby is gifted.

531
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:05,527
We know that. We just
didn't realize he was—

532
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:10,407
We still love you, Bobby. It's just
this mutant problem is a little—

533
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:15,245
- What mutant problem?
- Complicated.

534
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,457
What exactly are you a
professor of, Mr. Logan?

535
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,335
Art.

536
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,670
Well, you should see
what Bobby can do.

537
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,679
Bobby.

538
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,894
I can do a lot more than that.

539
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,026
Oh. Ronny!

540
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,783
This is all my fault.
Actually...

541
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:56,161
they discovered that males are the ones
who carry the mutant gene and pass it on...

542
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,038
so it's his fault.

543
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,040
...the assassination
attempt...

544
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,212
911. Please state your emergency.

545
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,673
I need the police. There
are people in our house.

546
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,883
They won't let us leave.
Authorities refused to comment...

547
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,761
but it's believed that a manhunt for
several fugitives from the facility...

548
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,847
is now underway.

549
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:21,270
Nobody's responding.
I can't get a signal.

550
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,355
Why don't you take a break?
I'll keep trying.

551
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,441
Right.

552
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:58,182
So, what are they?

553
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,059
They are angelic symbols...

554
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:05,147
passed on to mankind
by the Archangel Gabriel.

555
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:10,903
They're beautiful.
How many do you have?

556
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,780
One for every sin...

557
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,365
so quite a few.

558
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,413
You and Miss Grey
are schoolteachers?

559
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:26,835
Yes. At a school for people
like us... where we can be safe.

560
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,087
Safe from what?

561
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,256
Everyone else.

562
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:38,305
You know, outside of the circus,
most people were afraid of me.

563
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:42,226
But I didn't hate them.
I pitied them.

564
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,646
Do you know why?

565
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,857
Because most people
will never know anything...

566
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,945
beyond what they see
with their own two eyes.

567
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:56,782
Well, I gave up on pity
a long time ago.

568
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:06,041
Someone so beautiful
should not be so angry.

569
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,379
Sometimes anger...

570
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,631
can help you survive.

571
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,552
So can faith.

572
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,888
Storm, I found
an active com device.

573
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,765
Where?

574
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,985
Oh, it's for me.

575
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,531
Bobby...

576
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:42,703
have you tried
not being a mutant?

577
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:46,290
No one's left, Jean.
Soldiers came.

578
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,210
What about the children? Some of them
escaped. I'm not sure about the rest.

579
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,046
We haven't been able to reach
the professor or Scott either.

580
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:56,842
Where are you, Logan? Boston,
with Bobby Drake's family.

581
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:01,597
- Okay. We're on our way.
- And Storm? Make it fast.

582
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,354
We have to go now.
Why?

583
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,023
Now!
Logan, what's wrong?

584
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,905
Drop the knives
and put your hands in the air.

585
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,200
What's going on here?
- Ronny.

586
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,870
I said drop the knives.

587
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:28,248
Open the door!
Break it.

588
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,626
Turn around.

589
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,044
- Up against the wall.
- Okay!

590
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:37,257
This is just a misunderstanding.
Put the knives down.

591
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,801
I can't.

592
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,387
Look.

593
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,889
Oh!

594
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,437
All right, the rest of you,
on the ground now.

595
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,231
Look, kid,
I said on the ground.

596
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,075
We don't want to
hurt you, kid.

597
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:10,874
You know all those dangerous
mutants you hear about on the news?

598
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,920
I'm the worst one.

599
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,280
Look out!

600
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,340
Guten tag.

601
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,803
Who the hell is this?
Kurt Wagner.

602
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,139
But in the Munich circus, I was known
as "the Incredible Night crawler"—

603
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,309
- Aw, save it. Storm?
We're outta here.

604
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,853
Whoa.

605
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,791
Jason, stop it!

606
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:22,691
It's all right.

607
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,026
You can come out.
Have they gone?

608
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,696
Yes.

609
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,785
- Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.

610
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,288
Well, then, we'll have to
find them, won't we?

611
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,797
We'll use Cerebro.

612
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,383
Come on.

613
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,562
How far are we?

614
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,148
We're actually coming up
on the mansion now.

615
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,360
I've got two signals approaching.

616
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,114
Coming in fast.

617
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:19,748
Unidentified aircraft, you are ordered
to descend to 20,000 feet.

618
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:24,294
Return with our escort to Hanscom Air
Force base. You have 10 seconds to comply.

619
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,297
- Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.

620
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:31,927
We are coming up alongside you to
escort you to Hanscom Air Force base.

621
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:35,013
Lower your altitude now.

622
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:41,478
Repeat, lower your altitude to 20,000 feet.
This is your last warning.

623
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,777
They're falling back.

624
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,155
They're marking us.

625
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,032
- What?
- They're gonna fire. Hang on!

626
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,670
I gotta shake 'em.

627
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,054
- Please don't do that again.
- I agree.

628
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,101
Don't we have
any weapons in this heap?

629
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,583
Warning, warning, warning.

630
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,770
Warning, warning, warning,
warning, warning.

631
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:12,485
Warning, warning, warning,
warning, warning, warning.

632
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,779
Warning, warning, warning—

633
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:31,212
- Everybody okay back there?
- No.

634
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,305
Oh, my God.
There's two of 'em.

635
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:02,327
There's one more.

636
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,995
Jean—

637
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,290
Oh, God!

638
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,259
Rogue!

639
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,679
No!

640
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,389
- Jean?
- It's not me.

641
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,446
When will these people
learn how to fly?

642
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,551
Thank you.
Bitte schön.

643
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:52,478
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

644
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,607
His name is
Colonel William Stryker...

645
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,276
and he invaded your mansion
for one purpose:

646
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,905
He wanted Cerebro.

647
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,532
Or enough of it
to build one of his own.

648
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:09,913
But that doesn't make any sense.
Stryker would need the professor to operate it.

649
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,874
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend is still alive.

650
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,752
Oh, my God.

651
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,546
Now, what are you all so afraid of?

652
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,965
While Cerebro is working,
Charles' mind is connected...

653
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,218
to every living person
on the planet.

654
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,970
If he were forced to concentrate
hard enough on a particular group—

655
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,015
let's say, mutants,
for example—

656
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,477
- he could kill us all.
- Wait a minute.

657
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,272
How would Stryker even know where
to find Cerebro in the first place?

658
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,569
Because I told him.

659
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:46,032
I helped Charles build it,
remember?

660
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:50,411
Mr. Stryker has powerful
methods of persuasion.

661
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,956
Even against a mutant
as strong as Charles.

662
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:57,877
So who's this Stryker anyway?
He's a military scientist.

663
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:02,006
He spent his whole life trying
to solve the mutant problem.

664
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:06,844
If you want a more intimate
perspective, why don't you ask Wolverine?

665
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:10,556
You don't remember,
do you?

666
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,769
William Stryker, the only other man
I know who can manipulate adamantium.

667
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:19,357
The metal on your bones.
It carries his signature.

668
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:23,361
- But the professor-
- The professor trusted...

669
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:27,031
you were smart enough to
discover this on your own.

670
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,867
He gives you more credit
than I do.

671
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:34,747
- Why do you need us?
- Mystique has discovered plans of a base...

672
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:38,126
that Stryker's been
operating out off or decades.

673
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,461
We know that's where
he's building the second Cerebro...

674
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:44,173
but we don't know
where this base is...

675
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,676
and I believe
one of you might.

676
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:52,432
- The professor already tried.
- Once again, you think it's all about you.

677
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,187
Oh... hello.

678
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:07,613
I didn't mean to snoop.
Just try and relax.

679
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,381
I'm sorry.

680
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,220
Stryker's at Alkali Lake.

681
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,349
That's where the professor
sent me. There's nothing left.

682
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:39,395
There's nothing left on the surface,
Logan. The base is underground.

683
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,037
Hey.
Hey.

684
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,375
You okay?

685
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,835
Yeah.
You sure?

686
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:07,215
How we doing?
Not good.

687
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:10,093
It'll take four or five hours before
I can get it off the ground.

688
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,304
That's not what I meant.

689
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,767
I'm just worried about
Scott. I'm worried about you.

690
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,812
That was some display
of power up there.

691
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:25,274
Obviously, it wasn't enough.
Hey, hey. Come on. All right?

692
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:30,488
I love him.

693
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,826
Do you?

694
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,412
Girls flirt with
the dangerous guy, Logan...

695
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,497
they don't take him home.

696
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,291
They marry the good guy.

697
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,335
I could be the good guy.

698
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,171
Logan, the good guy
sticks around.

699
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:57,265
Jean.
Please. Please.

700
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,226
Don't make me do this. Do what?

701
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,813
This.

702
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,783
Excuse me.

703
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:20,455
They say you can imitate
anybody... even their voice.

704
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:24,041
Even their voice.

705
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,837
Then why not stay in
disguise all the time?

706
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:31,924
You know,
look like everyone else.

707
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,844
Because
we shouldn't have to.

708
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,708
Look—

709
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,151
No one's ever left a scar
quite like you.

710
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,487
What do you want,
an apology?

711
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,989
You know what I want.

712
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,911
But what do you want?

713
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,299
What do you really want?

714
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,803
I want you to get out.

715
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:06,811
Jesus.

716
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,319
Why don't we get uniforms?
Yeah, where's ours?

717
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,739
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.

718
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,833
We love what you've done
with your hair.

719
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:35,464
Hey, hey.
Come on. Let's go.

720
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,641
So, they say
you're the bad guy.

721
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:49,562
Is that what
they say?

722
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:57,069
That's a dorky-looking
helmet. What's it for?

723
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,947
This dorky-looking helmet is the
only thing that's gonna protect me...

724
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,700
from the real bad guys.

725
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,042
- What's your name?
- John.

726
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:15,588
What's your real name,
John?

727
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,596
Pyro.

728
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,806
Quite a talent
you have there, Pyro.

729
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,851
I can only manipulate
the fire.

730
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:30,645
I can't create it.

731
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,856
You are a god among insects.

732
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,567
Never let anyone tell you different.

733
01:17:56,505 --> 01:18:01,133
Sir, the machine has been
completed to all specifications.

734
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,010
Good.

735
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:06,472
Ow!

736
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:10,476
If I may ask, sir, why are we
keeping the children here?

737
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,270
I'm a scientist,
Sergeant Lyman.

738
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:18,442
When I build a machine, I wanna
make sure that it's working.

739
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:27,034
All right, this is a
topographic map of the dam.

740
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,036
This is the spillway.

741
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,289
You see these density
changes in the terrain?

742
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,333
They're tire tracks.
That's the entrance.

743
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:38,379
Mm-hmm. And this shows the depth of
the ice that's covering the ground.

744
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,965
Now, this is recent
water activity.

745
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,092
If we go in there, Stryker
could flood the spillway.

746
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,052
Can you teleport inside?

747
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:49,265
No. I have to be able
to see where I'm going...

748
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:52,101
otherwise I could
wind up inside a wall.

749
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:56,522
I'll go. I have a hunch
he'll want me alive.

750
01:18:56,606 --> 01:19:01,402
Wolverine, whoever goes into the dam needs
to be able to operate the spillway mechanism.

751
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,446
What do you intend to do?

752
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,365
Scratch it with your claws?

753
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,743
I'll take my chances.

754
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,328
But I won't.

755
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:36,353
Sir, there's someone
coming down the spillway.

756
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:42,526
I'm flooding it.
Wait.

757
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,701
Stryker!

758
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,836
Stryker!

759
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,050
Well, look who's come home.

760
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,398
Move and you're dead.

761
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,640
The one thing I know better
than anyone is my own work.

762
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:57,643
Seal the room. Shoot it.

763
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,436
Seal the room
Step away!

764
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:18,205
We have a metamorph loose.
Could be anybody.

765
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,416
Anybody?
What—

766
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,887
Can you override
the spillway mechanism?

767
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:35,681
Everything's controlled from inside that
room. That's why the doors are so thick.

768
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:39,143
Oh, really? Get some
charges! Blow the doors open!

769
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,022
Take out these cameras!

770
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,819
I'm in.

771
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:52,489
She's good.
You have no idea.

772
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:08,213
Fire in the hole.

773
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,511
Move, move, move.

774
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,530
Sergeant, she's opened
the spillway doors.

775
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,866
More mutants have entered
the base. How many?

776
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,494
We've lost coms. There's some
sort of electrical interference—

777
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:42,122
Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest of
your men and meet me outside Cerebro.

778
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,417
You carry on. When I come back,
I want this door open all the way!

779
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:02,351
Welcome, Professor.

780
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:06,897
- Don't leave me alone, please?
- You can come inside.

781
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,412
Have you found it?

782
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:07,958
A large portion of energy from the
dam has been diverted to this chamber.

783
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,626
Cerebro.
There it is.

784
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,963
Can you shut it down from here? No.

785
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:15,299
Come. There's little
time. Not without us.

786
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,264
Oh, my God.
The children.

787
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,433
- Kurt, will you come with me?
- Yes.

788
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,978
Where are they? They're being held
in a containment cell one level down.

789
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,482
Stryker.
All right...

790
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,442
we'll get the children
and meet you at Cerebro.

791
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:37,738
Okay. I'll try to find Scott
and the professor.

792
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:41,909
- Will you be all right without us?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

793
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,328
Where's Logan?

794
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:52,503
He's gone.

795
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,548
You, set up a perimeter.
Move, move.

796
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,882
Jason.

797
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,057
It's time.

798
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,439
Time to
find our friends.

799
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,906
Is it time to
find our friends?

800
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:06,201
- All of them.
- All of them?

801
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,912
- All of the mutants.
- All the mutants?

802
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:13,292
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

803
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,170
That's right.
Every one of them?

804
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,630
Oh, yes.
Good.

805
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:23,594
It's time to
bring it to an end.

806
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,931
Make me proud.

807
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,296
Just don't move.

808
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:05,510
Kill anyone who
approaches... even if it's me.

809
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,872
Go! I'll take care of him!

810
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:37,668
This is one lover's quarrel
we cannot get involved in, my dear.

811
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,721
Scott!

812
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,223
Scott?

813
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:56,520
Help us! Anybody!
- Listen.

814
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,689
Help! Get us out of here.

815
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,691
- Julie?
- Storm.

816
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,944
Get us out of here!
Okay, we're coming.

817
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,459
Scott!

818
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,440
Scott, don't do this!

819
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:35,744
Jean, no, no, no.
It's okay.

820
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:37,329
It's okay. It's me.

821
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,748
Scott.
I'm so sorry.

822
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,086
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh, God.

823
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,174
I'm so sorry. I could see you,
but I couldn't stop myself.

824
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,218
I tried. I'm sorry. I love you so much.

825
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:53,178
I love you.

826
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:58,600
My leg.
Okay, easy. Easy.

827
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:00,143
Scott...

828
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,648
something's wrong.

829
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:17,953
My God. No!

830
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:24,918
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

831
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,504
I'm trying.
There are so many of them.

832
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:30,298
Then concentrate.

833
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,342
Concentrate.

834
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:40,554
The tricky thing about
adamantium is...

835
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,139
that if you ever
manage to process...

836
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:48,436
its raw, liquid form,
you gotta keep it that way.

837
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:53,567
Keep it hot.

838
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:56,861
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

839
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,866
But you already
know that.

840
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,996
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

841
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:13,169
I was wrong.

842
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:33,940
Holy shit.

843
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:20,004
That's it.

844
01:35:21,924 --> 01:35:23,842
Whoa. Where do you
think you're going?

845
01:35:23,926 --> 01:35:26,219
I'm sick of this kid's table shit.
I'm going in there.

846
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:29,264
John, they told us to stay here.

847
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:31,307
You always do as you're told?

848
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:35,330
Find all the mutants.

849
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:37,332
Find them.

850
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:41,878
Find all the mutants. Find
them all. Each one. All of them.

851
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:44,005
Good.
Kill them.

852
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,723
Concentrate. Concentrate harder.

853
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:38,059
Now, find them all.
Find all the mutants.

854
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:40,478
You, concentrate harder.

855
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:46,025
Kill them.
Kill them all.

856
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,027
Kill them.

857
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:52,073
Cerebro.

858
01:37:52,157 --> 01:37:55,159
We're too late.

859
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:06,254
Eric, hurry!

860
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:57,180
That's strange.

861
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:36,594
How does it
look from there, Charles?

862
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,846
Still fighting the good fight?

863
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:43,434
From here, it doesn't look like
they're playing by your rules.

864
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:48,189
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.

865
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:28,479
There's been
a change of plan.

866
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:49,667
Good-bye, Charles.

867
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:07,393
There's been
a change of plans.

868
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:11,064
Now find them. Find
them all— the humans.

869
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,483
Find all the humans.
Every one.

870
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:36,005
How does it feel, bub?

871
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:43,805
Why did you come back? You
cut me open. You took my life!

872
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:47,058
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.

873
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:50,728
As I recall, it was you who
volunteered for the procedure.

874
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,525
Who am I?
You...

875
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:58,194
are just a failed experiment.

876
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,491
If you really knew
about your past...

877
01:42:03,575 --> 01:42:06,202
what kind of person you were...

878
01:42:06,286 --> 01:42:08,830
the work we did together-

879
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:12,917
People don't change,
Wolverine.

880
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:15,711
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.

881
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:18,172
I just gave you claws.

882
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:45,658
What the hell is that?
What is it?

883
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:49,787
The dam's ruptured. It's gonna
flood water into the spillway.

884
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:54,375
It's trying to relieve the pressure.
It's too late.

885
01:42:54,459 --> 01:42:56,836
In a few minutes,
we'll all be underwater.

886
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,839
Come with me, and I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

887
01:42:59,923 --> 01:43:04,010
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.

888
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:08,973
You're a survivor,
always have been.

889
01:43:09,057 --> 01:43:13,394
Oh, I thought I was just
an animal... with claws.

890
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,400
If we die, you die.

891
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:28,159
Aaah!

892
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:31,078
There are no exits that way, Wolverine!

893
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:36,083
Find all the humans.
Every one. Find them.

894
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,669
Find all the humans.
Find them all.

895
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:44,800
- What is this?
- Cerebro.

896
01:43:46,678 --> 01:43:48,304
Storm.

897
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:51,098
Jean. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine.

898
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,392
What's happening?

899
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:56,729
Professor's still in there...
with another mutant.

900
01:43:56,813 --> 01:44:00,066
He's trapped
in some kind of illusion.

901
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:02,693
Oh, my God.

902
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:05,738
Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants anymore.

903
01:44:05,822 --> 01:44:09,700
Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.

904
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,178
Impossible.

905
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:56,746
Everybody stand back.

906
01:44:56,747 --> 01:44:58,916
Scott, no. His mind
is connected to Cerebro.

907
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:02,753
Opening the door could kill him
and everyone his mind is linked to.

908
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:06,340
Wait. Kurt, I need
you to take me inside.

909
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:09,302
- Storm, who is this guy? Who are you?
- My name is Kurt Wagner...

910
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:13,389
but in the Munich circus—
He's a teleporter.

911
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:16,559
I told you, if I can't see
where I'm going—

912
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:19,562
I have faith in you.

913
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:25,776
Don't believe
anything you see in there.

914
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:34,118
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

915
01:45:34,202 --> 01:45:37,204
Thy kingdom come,
they will be done on Earth—

916
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:41,792
As it is in heaven.

917
01:45:51,386 --> 01:45:53,304
Hello.

918
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:56,599
What are you looking for?

919
01:45:58,393 --> 01:46:02,980
Professor, can you hear me?

920
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:07,151
- You've got to stop Cerebro now.
- Who are you talking to?

921
01:46:08,945 --> 01:46:10,696
No. Don't move.

922
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:13,199
But she's just a little girl.

923
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:15,576
No, she's not.

924
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:22,917
I've got my eyes on you.

925
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,715
Mr. Stryker.

926
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,426
Funny, we keep
running into each other.

927
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:36,555
Mark my words,
it'll never happen again.

928
01:46:39,684 --> 01:46:43,687
Kurt, it's about
to get very cold in here.

929
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:46,941
I'm not going anywhere.

930
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:54,490
What are you doing?

931
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,530
Find all the humans. Kill them.

932
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:36,699
Every single one.
Find all the humans.

933
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:43,497
Focus. Focus.
Find all the humans.

934
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:54,175
Stop it!

935
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:07,146
Jason. He's going to be so angry at me.

936
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,594
Logan. Logan, where are you?

937
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,960
We have to get out
through the spillway.

938
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:52,001
You don't want to go
that way. Trust me.

939
01:50:03,054 --> 01:50:06,682
Come on. There's
another way out of here.

940
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:40,716
The helicopter
was right here!

941
01:51:23,885 --> 01:51:27,721
I will take him.
Okay.

942
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:56,875
It's okay, Rogue. It's okay.
You can let go, honey.

943
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,920
- Let go.
- Go. I'll be fine.

944
01:52:00,046 --> 01:52:02,631
You sure?
Yeah.

945
01:52:14,352 --> 01:52:16,729
Who has the answers,
Wolverine?

946
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:19,523
Those people?

947
01:52:19,607 --> 01:52:23,110
That creature
in your arms?

948
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:28,449
Huh?

949
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:39,752
I'll take my chances with him.

950
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:46,383
One day, someone will finish
what I've started, Wolverine!

951
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:52,431
One day!

952
01:52:56,686 --> 01:53:01,356
Scott, we've got to
get to Washington.

953
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:07,362
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.

954
01:53:08,406 --> 01:53:10,491
Bobby.
I got 'im.

955
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,745
You okay?

956
01:53:14,829 --> 01:53:17,664
I am now.

957
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:27,841
- What's wrong?
- Vertical thrusters are off line.

958
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:29,092
So fix 'em.
I'm trying.

959
01:53:29,177 --> 01:53:31,929
- Has anyone seen John?
- Pyro?

960
01:53:32,013 --> 01:53:33,931
Where the hell
is he?

961
01:53:34,015 --> 01:53:36,600
He's with Magneto.

962
01:53:36,684 --> 01:53:39,853
They're functioning, but I don't
know how long they're going to last.

963
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:41,855
I'm trying to override.
It's not responding.

964
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:47,027
- Come on!
- Oh, no, we've lost the power.

965
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:59,331
There's power in the fuel cells,
we're just not connecting.

966
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:01,333
Okay. I've—

967
01:54:19,477 --> 01:54:22,437
Scott, the engine
control system is shot.

968
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:26,483
- Which part?
- All of it.

969
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:33,156
Where's the override?
- It's gonna take some time.

970
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:50,507
Storm, we need some kind
of external power.

971
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:53,135
- Jean?
- Wait. Where is Jean?

972
01:54:55,305 --> 01:54:58,098
She's outside.

973
01:55:12,196 --> 01:55:14,281
No, we're not leaving!
Lower the ramp!

974
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:30,088
Storm, lower it!

975
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:32,341
I can't.

976
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:56,114
She's controlling the jet.

977
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:05,707
You, get her, now!
She's not letting me.

978
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:07,042
Damn it!

979
01:56:12,256 --> 01:56:16,385
I know what I'm doing.

980
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:19,346
- This is—
... the only way.

981
01:56:20,932 --> 01:56:25,102
Jean, listen to me.

982
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:29,648
Don't do this.
Good-bye.

983
01:56:29,732 --> 01:56:34,403
- Oh, no! No!
- No! No!

984
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:00,721
She's gone.

985
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:06,893
- She's gone.
- Don't you say that!

986
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,520
We gotta go back.
She's gone.

987
01:57:08,604 --> 01:57:12,399
No! No.

988
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:32,711
She's gone.
She's gone. She's—

989
01:57:35,548 --> 01:57:37,466
She's gone.

990
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:51,563
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

991
01:57:51,647 --> 01:57:56,443
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

992
01:57:56,527 --> 01:58:00,405
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of the death...

993
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:02,824
I will fear no evil...

994
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:07,579
for thou art with me.

995
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:22,636
Today I've been given an opportunity
to shed light on recent occurrences...

996
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,888
from the attack that ended
in this office— Good morning.

997
01:58:24,972 --> 01:58:27,349
Good morning— to the unexplained
phenomenon that swept the Earth...

998
01:58:27,475 --> 01:58:30,102
nearly annihilating our way of
life. Good morning, Mr. President.

999
01:58:30,186 --> 01:58:33,438
- Good morning. Do we like
this word "annihilating"?

1000
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:36,483
Good morning.

1001
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:39,945
Good morning,
Mr. President.

1002
01:58:40,029 --> 01:58:41,321
Thank you.

1003
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:52,040
Mr. President, we're live
in five, four, three, two—

1004
01:58:54,043 --> 01:58:58,463
My fellow Americans,
in this time of adversity...

1005
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,799
we are being offered
a moment...

1006
01:59:00,883 --> 01:59:04,803
a moment to recognize a growing
threat within our own population...

1007
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:09,057
and take a unique role
in the shape of human events.

1008
01:59:13,896 --> 01:59:16,565
Did we just lose the feed?
Are we still live?

1009
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:56,021
Good morning, Mr. President.

1010
01:59:56,105 --> 02:00:00,567
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.

1011
02:00:00,651 --> 02:00:04,696
- Who are you people?
- We're mutants.

1012
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:08,074
My name is Charles Xavier.
Please, sit down.

1013
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:12,746
- I'd rather stand.
- Rogue.

1014
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:17,250
These files were taken from the
private offices of William Stryker.

1015
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:28,553
How did you get this?

1016
02:00:28,638 --> 02:00:32,307
Well, let's just say I know a little girl
who can walk through walls.

1017
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:44,653
I've never seen this
information. I know.

1018
02:00:44,737 --> 02:00:46,905
Then you also know
I don't respond well to threats.

1019
02:00:46,989 --> 02:00:50,450
Mr. President, this is not a threat.
This is an opportunity.

1020
02:00:50,534 --> 02:00:54,663
There are forces in this world,
both mutant and human alike...

1021
02:00:54,747 --> 02:00:57,082
who believe that a war is coming.

1022
02:00:57,166 --> 02:01:01,002
You will see from those files that
some have already tried to start one...

1023
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:04,756
and there have been casualties.

1024
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:07,342
Losses on both sides.

1025
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:16,434
Mr. President...

1026
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:20,313
what you were about to tell the
world is true— this is a moment.

1027
02:01:20,398 --> 02:01:23,108
A moment to repeat
the mistakes of the past...

1028
02:01:23,192 --> 02:01:27,028
or to work together
for a better future.

1029
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:32,784
We're here to stay, Mr. President.
The next move is yours.

1030
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:35,620
We'll be watching.

1031
02:01:53,347 --> 02:01:57,225
Mr. President.

1032
02:02:24,253 --> 02:02:26,171
You know...

1033
02:02:26,255 --> 02:02:28,840
even when Jean
was a student...

1034
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:32,010
she was always hesitant
about her powers.

1035
02:02:32,094 --> 02:02:36,890
Always looking to others.

1036
02:02:36,974 --> 02:02:41,936
Feeling that in some way
she was left behind.

1037
02:02:45,858 --> 02:02:47,776
Do you think—

1038
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:51,654
Could we have done
more to save her?

1039
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:57,118
In the past, she may have let us.

1040
02:02:57,203 --> 02:03:00,789
There had to be another way.

1041
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:03,375
Why did she leave the plane?

1042
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:09,547
Because she made a choice.

1043
02:03:09,632 --> 02:03:13,551
Yes, come on in.

1044
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:27,315
Hey, hey.

1045
02:03:29,276 --> 02:03:32,821
Listen, she did make a choice.

1046
02:03:35,282 --> 02:03:37,283
It was you.

1047
02:04:10,025 --> 02:04:12,527
Professor?

1048
02:04:12,611 --> 02:04:14,654
Is everything all right?

1049
02:04:17,408 --> 02:04:20,618
Yes, I think it will be.

1050
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:23,663
Now, tell me, have any
of you read a book...

1051
02:04:23,747 --> 02:04:27,375
by an English novelist
named T.H. White...

1052
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:30,753
called The Once and Future King?

1053
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:33,423
No? Well—

1054
02:04:38,846 --> 02:04:40,388
Mutation.

1055
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:42,724
It is the key
to our evolution.

1056
02:04:42,808 --> 02:04:45,810
It is how we have evolved from
a single-celled organism...

1057
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:48,938
into the dominant species
on the planet.

1058
02:04:49,023 --> 02:04:50,857
This process is slow...

1059
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:54,652
normally taking thousands
and thousands of years.

1060
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:57,697
But every
few hundred millennia...

1061
02:04:57,781 --> 02:05:00,445
evolution leaps forward.
