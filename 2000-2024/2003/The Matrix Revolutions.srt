1
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,870
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,570
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,510
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,780
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

5
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,420
I was afraid you'd say that.

6
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,250
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

7
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,860
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

8
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,760
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.

9
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,800
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,470
Any change?

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,410
No.

12
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,280
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

13
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,040
At least until he wakes up.

14
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,420
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

15
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,750
He'd better have some good answers.

16
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,090
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,330
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,800
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

19
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,140
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.

20
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,510
- For what?
- For Neo.

21
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,050
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,450
Please, for me.

23
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,660
This is what keeps bothering me.

24
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,820
What?

25
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,700
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

26
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,810
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

27
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,270
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

28
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,320
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,690
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,390
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

31
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,200
Jesus H. Christ.

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,000
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

33
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,580
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,580
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,950
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

36
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,480
Operator.

37
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,260
It's Seraph.

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,650
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

39
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,140
Good morning.

40
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,910
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,110
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

42
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,320
Are you lost, Neo?

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,520
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

44
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,630
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,100
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

46
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,240
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

47
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,940
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,450
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

49
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,520
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

50
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,770
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

51
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,710
One thing I've learned in all my years...

52
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,970
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

53
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,180
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

54
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,220
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

55
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,260
I'm sorry this had to happen.

56
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

57
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,130
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

58
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,200
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

59
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,770
What choice?

60
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,080
To help you, to guide Neo.

61
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,180
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...

62
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,180
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

63
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,480
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

64
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,390
...because here I am, at it again.

65
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,430
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

66
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,330
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

67
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,800
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

68
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,540
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

69
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,880
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

70
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,490
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

71
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,820
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

72
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,820
The Merovingian.

73
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,520
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

74
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,230
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

75
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,170
For years he has protected me.

76
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,830
I hope he can do the same for you.

77
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,710
Please, follow me.

78
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,310
Oracle...

79
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,680
I know, Morpheus.

80
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,620
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

81
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,420
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

82
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,330
I don't.

83
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,160
I expect just what I've always expected:

84
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,640
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.

85
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,240
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

86
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,850
He needs all our help.

87
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,880
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

88
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,280
No.

89
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,480
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

90
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,660
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

91
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,590
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

92
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,260
Yes, Papa.

93
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,770
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

94
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,710
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

95
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,610
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,780
We are most honored to meet you.

97
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,550
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,180
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

99
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,460
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

100
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,120
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

101
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,200
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

102
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,940
It's okay.

103
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,800
I don't have an answer.

104
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,500
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

105
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,480
It is between your world and our world.

106
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,980
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

107
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,360
Why did I know you would say that?

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,460
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

109
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,520
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

110
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,630
I know that if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

111
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,070
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

112
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,870
Is that what you're doing here?

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,000
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

114
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,340
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

115
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,950
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,380
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

117
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,350
The answer is simple.

118
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,290
I love my daughter very much.

119
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,990
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

120
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,900
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

121
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,730
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

122
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,270
If it does not, it is deleted.

123
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,110
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

124
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,010
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

125
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,590
Heard a program speak of love.

126
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,690
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

127
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,260
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

128
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,660
I see that you are in love.

129
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,330
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

130
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,740
Anything.

131
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,340
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not
so different than the reason I am here.

132
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,950
That's him.

133
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,990
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

134
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,060
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

135
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,830
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

136
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,050
Oh, no!

137
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,660
Damn it!

138
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,330
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

139
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,700
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

140
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,800
- You think it has something to do with me?
- I cannot say.

141
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,850
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

142
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,880
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

143
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,820
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

144
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,520
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

145
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,660
Goodbye?

146
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,490
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

147
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,730
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

148
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,340
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

149
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,570
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

150
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,940
Karma is a word, like love.

151
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,910
A way of saying:

152
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,310
"What I am here to do."

153
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,110
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

154
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,810
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

155
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,050
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

156
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,400
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

157
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,070
Can I carry that for you?

158
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,260
All right.

159
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,980
Hurry it up, I'm late!

160
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,320
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.

161
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,890
I know you.

162
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,790
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

163
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,330
I'll pay you whatever you want.

164
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,970
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

165
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,830
Oh, no, no, no.

166
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,910
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

167
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,600
If I know him...

168
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,240
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

169
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,520
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

170
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,280
I built this place.

171
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,760
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

172
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,300
Down here, I'm God.

173
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,470
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

174
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,230
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

175
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,120
No. We know what has to be done.

176
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,200
Shit.

177
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,980
You gotta be kidding.

178
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,200
Holy shit, it's wingless.

179
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,500
I get it.

180
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,510
You must be ready to die.

181
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,380
I need to speak with him.

182
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,220
Only way you're getting through this door
is over my big, dead ass.

183
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,320
So be it.

184
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,980
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

185
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,590
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

186
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,950
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

187
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,290
And if we're unlucky?

188
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,290
There will be many men.

189
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,830
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.

190
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,070
What in the hell?

191
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,650
I don't believe this.

192
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,910
Hey!

193
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,250
The prodigal child returns.

194
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,500
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

195
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,440
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

196
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,770
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

197
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,780
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

198
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,320
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

199
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,680
I'll tell you what I will do.

200
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,820
Put down the guns, and I will promise you
a safe passage out of here.

201
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,590
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

202
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,490
Of course.

203
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,290
Who could have guessed we would see
each other so soon after our last meeting?

204
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,570
The Fates are too kind, eh?

205
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,230
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

206
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,240
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

207
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,680
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

208
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,340
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

209
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,820
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

210
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,080
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

211
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,060
You know why we are here?

212
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,820
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.

213
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,090
It is my business to know.

214
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,500
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

215
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,240
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

216
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,540
- Do you know?
- No.

217
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,440
No?

218
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,780
I did not think so.

219
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,890
But it is always best to ask, huh?

220
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,110
We want to make a deal.

221
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,090
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

222
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,600
Okay. I have something you want.

223
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,700
To make a deal...

224
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,430
...you must have something
I want, yes?

225
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,910
And it so happens
there is something I want.

226
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,450
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

227
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,420
It is said they cannot be taken...

228
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,150
...they can only be given.

229
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,550
What?

230
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,650
The eyes of the Oracle.

231
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,990
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

232
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,930
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

233
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,740
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

234
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,210
Where others see chance...

235
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,910
...I see cost.

236
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,380
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

237
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,860
...and I will give you back your savior.

238
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,760
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

239
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,860
Yes? No?

240
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,030
I don't have time for this shit.

241
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,530
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

242
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,770
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

243
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,680
Interesting deal.

244
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,650
You are really ready to die
for this man?

245
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,410
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

246
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,790
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

247
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,450
She's in love.

248
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,700
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

249
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,460
Time's up.

250
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,190
What's it gonna be, Merv?

251
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,680
Okay. You got yourself in here...

252
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,440
...you can get yourself out.

253
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,460
Are you ready for us?

254
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,600
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

255
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,900
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

256
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,010
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

257
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,100
I can't leave yet.

258
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,410
I have to see her.

259
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,310
Now?

260
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,820
It's my last chance.

261
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,820
That's it. That's the secret.

262
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,160
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

263
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,260
Cookies need love like everything does.

264
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,540
Neo!

265
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,810
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

266
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,900
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

267
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,080
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

268
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,340
Okay.

269
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,510
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

270
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,760
So do you recognize me?

271
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,130
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

272
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,130
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

273
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,140
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

274
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,670
...but I still love candy.

275
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,510
No, thank you.

276
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,810
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

277
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,080
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

278
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,490
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

279
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,950
You gave me a few surprises too.

280
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,430
I hope I helped.

281
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,000
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

282
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,960
Where is this going?

283
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,660
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

284
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,370
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

285
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,840
...no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand, and I mean no one.

286
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,350
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

287
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,050
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

288
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,290
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

289
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,990
- Of course not.
- Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?

290
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,400
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

291
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,200
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

292
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,300
You know who.

293
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,210
I did.

294
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,080
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

295
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,980
So do I.

296
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,090
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

297
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,960
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

298
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,260
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

299
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,900
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

300
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,630
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

301
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,040
- Where?
- The source.

302
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,880
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.

303
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,020
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

304
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,790
The Architect said that if I didn't return to
the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.

305
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,260
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

306
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,200
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

307
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,440
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

308
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,310
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

309
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,510
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

310
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,380
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

311
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,910
What's your purpose?

312
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,110
To unbalance it.

313
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,380
Why? What do you want?

314
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,490
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

315
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,530
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

316
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,540
The end of the war.

317
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,600
Is it going to end?

318
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,470
One way or another.

319
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,440
Can Zion be saved?

320
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,680
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

321
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,390
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

322
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,250
- Where?
- You know where.

323
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,320
And if you can't find the answer...

324
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,990
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

325
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,330
What does that mean?

326
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,970
Everything that has a beginning...

327
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,620
...has an end.

328
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,720
I see the end coming.

329
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,790
I see the darkness spreading.

330
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,390
I see death.

331
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,750
And you are all that stands in his way.

332
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,160
Smith.

333
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,470
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

334
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,370
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

335
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,600
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

336
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,310
What is he?

337
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,410
He is you.

338
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,010
Your opposite, your negative.

339
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,780
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

340
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,990
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

341
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,020
...this war is going to end.

342
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:04,100
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

343
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,100
...or in his.

344
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,140
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

345
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,620
I need time.

346
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,860
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

347
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,370
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

348
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,670
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

349
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,720
I love that smell.

350
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,810
I sure am going to miss it.

351
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,620
- Oracle.
- I know.

352
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,020
I know.

353
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,890
Sati, honey.

354
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,330
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

355
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,270
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

356
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,840
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

357
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,010
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

358
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm scared, Seraph.

359
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,570
Come.

360
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,450
He's following us.

361
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,420
Well, well, it's been a long time.

362
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,960
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

363
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,090
I have beaten you before.

364
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,040
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

365
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,970
And you must be the last exile.

366
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,140
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

367
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,210
What did she say about me?

368
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,310
That you were a bad man.

369
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,350
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

370
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,550
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

371
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,790
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

372
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,730
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.

373
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,600
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

374
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,830
Why wouldn't she leave?

375
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,840
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

376
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,580
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

377
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,450
...deliberately, purposefully...

378
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,650
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

379
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,560
What did you do with Sati?

380
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,830
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

381
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,360
You are a bastard.

382
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,510
You would know, Mom.

383
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,700
Do what you're here to do.

384
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,210
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,400
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

386
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,000
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

387
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,200
Yeah, definitely.

388
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,670
You're right about that, sir.

389
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,510
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

390
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,910
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

391
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,920
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

392
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,760
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

393
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,660
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

394
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,540
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

395
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,040
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

396
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,010
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

397
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,010
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

398
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
Sir, we found her.

399
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,300
- The Logos?
- Yes, sir.

400
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,570
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

401
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,670
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

402
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,340
No, sir. Nothing yet.

403
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,150
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.

404
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,380
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,640
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

406
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,750
Careful, sir.

407
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,430
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

408
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,920
What was that?

409
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,090
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

410
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,790
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

411
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,100
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

412
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,110
We didn't know what happened after...

413
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,070
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

414
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,270
I'm happy to see you too.

415
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,050
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

416
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,380
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

417
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,150
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

418
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,790
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

419
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,830
Exactly what I needed to hear.

420
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,330
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

421
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,040
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside the city...

422
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,800
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

423
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,970
Thus, our primary objective must be...

424
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,610
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

425
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,020
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent
them from ever reaching the city.

426
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,320
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

427
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,650
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

428
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,590
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

429
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,820
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

430
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,230
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

431
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,770
That is correct.

432
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,310
Precisely what size force are you planning
to commit to the primary dock objective?

433
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,000
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

434
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,210
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

435
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,650
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

436
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,690
...and march them into that dock.

437
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,620
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

438
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,760
Time will tell, councillor.

439
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,720
Commander, just one more question.

440
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,160
Has there been word
from the Nebuchadnezza?

441
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,790
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

442
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,960
Perhaps.

443
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,570
But we can hope.

444
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,140
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

445
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,990
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

446
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,820
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

447
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,290
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

448
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,990
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

449
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,100
Kids, you stay here.

450
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,410
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

451
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,600
- I have to.
- Why?

452
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,940
Because I love him.

453
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,980
I love him the same as he loves me.

454
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,490
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.

455
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,950
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

456
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,290
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

457
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,330
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

458
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,630
...what would you do?

459
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,670
Make shells.

460
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,320
What the shit is going on over here?

461
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,020
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

462
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,320
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

463
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,760
A unit volunteer, sir.

464
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,170
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

465
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,300
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

466
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,770
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

467
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,070
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

468
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,570
Okay, I'm 16.

469
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,410
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

470
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,390
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

471
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,890
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

472
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,730
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

473
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:58,670
You do, and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

474
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,180
Okay, charge the igniter.

475
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,260
She lives again.

476
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,620
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

477
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,200
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

478
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,630
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

479
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,570
Looking good, except...

480
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,440
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

481
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,810
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

482
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,480
-What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

483
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,480
The machines have taken Junction 21.

484
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:57,520
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

485
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,330
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

486
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,070
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can,
then blow our EMP.

487
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,230
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

488
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,610
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

489
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,270
No, it's not.

490
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,510
There's another way. A support line.

491
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,450
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

492
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,660
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down
without them ever knowing.

493
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,060
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

494
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,320
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.

495
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,990
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

496
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,040
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

497
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,840
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

498
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,910
Hi.

499
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:54,150
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

500
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,090
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

501
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,390
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

502
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,830
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

503
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,660
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

504
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,530
To go where?

505
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,870
To the machine city.

506
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,640
I know it's difficult to understand.

507
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,370
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

508
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,010
I still have to go.

509
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,380
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

510
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,250
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

511
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,410
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

512
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,930
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

513
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,190
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

514
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,300
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

515
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,660
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

516
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,670
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

517
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,370
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

518
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,320
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

519
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,780
...with my ship
after that little speech.

520
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:06,390
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

521
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,520
If we leave inside the hour,
we should reach Zion as the machines do.

522
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,260
That's as good a plan as any.

523
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,160
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

524
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,870
Two ships, two directions.

525
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,240
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

526
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,050
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

527
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,950
Then why are you doing this?

528
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,120
I believe in him.

529
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,980
Thank you.

530
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,890
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

531
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,940
To make it easier for you to remember.

532
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,770
What if I don't want to remember?

533
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,840
Why would you want that?

534
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,110
What if I blew that EMP?

535
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,080
What if I did destroy those ships...

536
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,050
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

537
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,090
If I did that...

538
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,030
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

539
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,140
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

540
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,120
I'm ready.

541
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,210
Trinity...

542
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,790
...there's something I have to say.

543
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,700
Something you need to understand.

544
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,770
I know I'm supposed to go.

545
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,200
But beyond that...

546
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,640
...I don't know. I...

547
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,750
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

548
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,550
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

549
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,890
Just like you knew the moment you looked
at me that I was coming with you.

550
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,590
I'm scared, Trin.

551
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,900
So am I.

552
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,360
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

553
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,430
But I'll tell you something.

554
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,540
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

555
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,700
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

556
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,810
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

557
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,510
No.

558
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,420
Nothing.

559
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,100
-Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.

560
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,600
Let's move it. We are out of time.

561
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,070
You're not leaving them anything?

562
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,410
He said he didn't need it.

563
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,740
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

564
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,990
Thank you.

565
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,730
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

566
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,330
Me too.

567
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,090
It was an honor, sir.

568
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,400
No, the honor is still mine.

569
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,350
-We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.

570
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,160
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

571
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,770
Bye, baby.

572
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,770
Take good care of them.

573
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,390
Ready?

574
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,200
Engine's still firing.

575
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,000
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

576
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,790
- I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
- Bane.

577
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,090
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

578
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,250
Every time, I thought it was the last.

579
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,270
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

580
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,000
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

581
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,370
What are you talking about?

582
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:30,780
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

583
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,890
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

584
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,370
You're gonna pay for that.

585
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,370
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
-We got an emergency.

586
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,070
- What is it, AK?
-It's Maggie, sir.

587
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,440
She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.

588
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,110
Goddamn it.

589
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,460
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

590
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,390
He fired that EMP.

591
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,220
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

592
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,330
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

593
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,330
- I know where he is.
- The Logos.

594
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,730
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

595
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,840
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

596
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,910
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

597
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,670
...he'll control another EMP.

598
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,020
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

599
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,280
Mr. Anderson.

600
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,090
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

601
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,120
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

602
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,230
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

603
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,300
...that appearances can be deceiving.

604
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:59,300
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

605
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,700
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

606
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,930
Don't do it.

607
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:09,340
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

608
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,780
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

609
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,950
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

610
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,120
- He can't.
- Do it.

611
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:32,170
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

612
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,510
Let her go.

613
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,720
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

614
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,060
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

615
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,860
I do. I think of nothing else.

616
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,540
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

617
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,210
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

618
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:24,720
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

619
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,790
Disgusting.

620
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,700
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

621
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,370
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

622
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,850
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

623
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,980
Look past the flesh.

624
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:58,490
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

625
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,590
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

626
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,860
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

627
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,930
There is nowhere I won't find you.

628
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,130
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

629
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,260
Inevitable.

630
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,080
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

631
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,940
This is it. It's gotta be.

632
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,650
Oh, no.

633
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:30,710
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

634
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,420
Blind messiah.

635
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,990
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

636
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,990
Helpless.

637
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,570
Pathetic.

638
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,780
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

639
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,520
I can see you.

640
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,190
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

641
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,270
It's not over.

642
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,120
- Trinity!
- Neo.

643
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,120
Neo.

644
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,250
Oh, no. Your eyes.

645
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,590
I'll be okay.

646
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,090
It's all right, Trin.

647
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,740
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

648
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,470
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

649
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,310
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

650
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,150
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

651
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,810
Yes, sir.

652
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,380
Come on, move.

653
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,180
All right!

654
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,190
This is it.

655
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,420
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

656
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,030
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

657
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,660
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

658
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,710
...we give them hell before we do!

659
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,880
Yeah!

660
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,560
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

661
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,120
But I'll make you a deal.

662
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,830
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

663
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,940
Deal.

664
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,410
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

665
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,790
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

666
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,660
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

667
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:40,590
- Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

668
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,940
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

669
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,140
If we can just get close enough...

670
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,020
Six hundred meters.

671
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,790
There.

672
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,930
Shit!

673
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,710
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

674
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,670
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

675
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,510
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

676
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,330
I'm coming, baby.

677
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,140
Here they come.

678
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:07,580
-Slow down, this ain't theLogos.
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

679
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:19,390
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

680
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,770
Breach! The dock is breached!

681
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,760
Knuckle up!

682
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,680
For Zion!

683
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,550
Shit.

684
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,520
Come on, let's go.

685
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,660
Knuckle up!

686
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,150
Reload!

687
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,790
Reload nine!

688
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,760
Go, go! Move, move!

689
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,800
Watch your left!

690
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,110
Don't let them through!

691
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,670
Zuka!

692
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,420
Oh, my God.

693
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:00,660
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

694
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,870
Dig this!

695
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,370
Oh, shit!

696
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,430
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!

697
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,620
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

698
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:45,370
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

699
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,900
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

700
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,010
Damn it!

701
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,310
Yeah.

702
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,920
Grab my belt.

703
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,800
Just give me one clean shot.

704
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,770
Damn it!

705
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,130
Charra!

706
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,810
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

707
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,450
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

708
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,810
I think it's one of ours, sir.

709
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,950
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

710
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,850
Contact them.
I want access codes.

711
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,550
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

712
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:17,620
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

713
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,600
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

714
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,110
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

715
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,180
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

716
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,050
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

717
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,710
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the Hammer,sir.

718
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,580
How can that be?

719
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,740
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

720
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,720
At its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

721
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,220
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

722
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:23,530
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

723
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,920
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

724
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,400
Sir, we already lost the dock.

725
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,900
Open the gate.

726
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:39,940
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

727
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,340
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

728
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,450
There's the exit.

729
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:57,080
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

730
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,330
Full power...

731
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,930
...ninety degrees.

732
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,570
Now!

733
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,070
Hold on, baby.

734
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,550
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

735
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,710
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

736
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,850
Sentinels are inside the dock.

737
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,590
Are we too late?

738
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,860
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

739
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,020
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

740
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,790
Reload!

741
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,190
He's pissing metal.

742
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,190
Go!

743
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,050
Go!

744
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,740
Heads up! They're coming around!

745
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:38,280
Behind you!

746
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,670
It's jammed!

747
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:02,140
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

748
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,910
Got it!

749
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,280
Captain Mifune.

750
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,320
Oh, no.

751
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,150
They're coming.

752
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,120
They're coming.

753
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,690
The Hammer.

754
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,630
What?

755
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:53,830
You have to open that gate.

756
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,260
Cut the counterweights.

757
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,770
You can do it.

758
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,330
Hurry. There's no time.

759
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:06,140
Captain...

760
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:08,680
...I didn't finish the training program.

761
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,680
Neither did I.

762
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,170
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

763
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,700
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

764
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,970
Come on, someone, please.

765
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,560
Keep the weight forward.

766
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,360
Light as a feather.

767
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,730
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU
is up and moving to Gate Three.

768
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,810
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

769
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:34,520
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

770
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,500
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

771
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,000
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

772
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:43,640
Mifune...

773
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:45,430
...this is Lock.

774
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,510
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

775
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,010
... theHammer's two minutes away.

776
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:55,780
You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.

777
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:58,380
Link.

778
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,590
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

779
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,860
Do it, kid.

780
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:46,800
Neo. I believe.

781
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,870
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

782
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,310
We ain't come this far.

783
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,730
Almost home, almost home.

784
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,350
Burn it, Link!

785
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,850
- You did it.
- No.

786
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,240
We did it.

787
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,250
You're a hell of a pilot.

788
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,220
Some things in this world never change.

789
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,930
But some things do?

790
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,160
Luckily...

791
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,260
...some things do.

792
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:34,240
Link!

793
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,570
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

794
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:46,390
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

795
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:49,080
I made a promise.

796
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,270
You did wear it.

797
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:04,570
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

798
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,310
Three captains, one ship.

799
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:20,480
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

800
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,280
Good to see you too, Jason.

801
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,790
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

802
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,090
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

803
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,430
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

804
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,470
That's the problem with you people.

805
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,200
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

806
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:41,070
That EMP knocked out almost every piece
of hardware and every APU.

807
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,210
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

808
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:48,140
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

809
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,880
Come on, get it cut.

810
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,790
The bridge is clear.

811
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,330
Do you hear that?

812
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,190
Get that cable run!

813
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:11,210
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

814
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,880
Order everyone to fall back.

815
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,740
Seal the shaft. Now.

816
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,180
Move it!

817
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,150
Oh, my God.

818
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:35,490
- All clear.
- Do it.

819
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,860
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

820
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,740
Your move.

821
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,580
So you gave them your ship?

822
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:03,190
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

823
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,690
The Oracle said nothing of this?

824
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:12,230
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

825
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,060
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

826
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,440
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

827
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:24,910
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

828
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,880
No, he wasn't.

829
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,420
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

830
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:37,020
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

831
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:39,820
...if he'll reach the machine city.

832
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,230
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

833
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:49,300
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

834
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,800
...he will not give up.

835
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,600
And neither can we.

836
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,450
Temperature's dropping.

837
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,290
Here we go.

838
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,560
We're over the fields, aren't we?

839
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:52,300
How do you know that?

840
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,940
I can feel them.

841
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:05,310
Over there.

842
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:10,050
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

843
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,480
Power lines.

844
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,250
Follow them.

845
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:33,070
What are they doing?

846
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,940
I don't know.

847
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:36,840
Lieutenant?

848
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,190
Goddamn it.

849
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,860
What do we do now?

850
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,660
It is now a matter of time.

851
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,930
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

852
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,740
I recommend that the Council join the other
non-military personnel inside the temple.

853
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,780
How long do we have?

854
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,950
Two hours. Maybe less.

855
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:22,890
My men have fortified the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last stand.

856
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:27,290
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

857
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,230
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

858
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,400
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

859
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:37,940
I would ask him.

860
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:42,470
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

861
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:52,280
There. Those mountains.

862
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,180
That's it.

863
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,300
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

864
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,460
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

865
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,290
We'll make it.

866
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:10,000
We have to.

867
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,980
Sentinels.

868
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:37,720
There's too many!

869
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,670
Gotcha!

870
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:58,610
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

871
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:01,220
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

872
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,480
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

873
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,190
Then up we go.

874
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:45,290
Beautiful.

875
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,810
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

876
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,700
Again. Slowly.

877
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,160
Now!

878
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,180
Trin?

879
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:55,030
Trinity?

880
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,760
Trinity?

881
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,100
- I'm here.
- Where?

882
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,500
Here.

883
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,210
We made it.

884
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,790
You said we would.

885
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,520
It's unbelievable, Trin.

886
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:25,220
Light everywhere.

887
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:28,400
Like the whole thing was built of light.

888
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,230
I wish you could see what I see.

889
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,870
You've already shown me so much.

890
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:40,440
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

891
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,340
I can't go with you, Neo.

892
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,810
I've gone as far as I can.

893
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:49,450
What?

894
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,890
Oh, no.

895
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,490
Oh, no. No, no.

896
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,890
It's all right.

897
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,890
It's time.

898
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,970
I've done all that I could do.

899
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,570
Now you have to do the rest.

900
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:12,430
You have to finish it.

901
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,940
You have to save Zion.

902
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:17,110
I can't.

903
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:20,880
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

904
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,110
You will.

905
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,280
I believe it. I always have.

906
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,390
Trinity.

907
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:37,100
Trinity, you can't die.

908
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:41,230
You can't.

909
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,130
You can't.

910
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:45,430
Yes, I can.

911
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:51,050
You brought me back once.

912
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,340
But not this time.

913
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,120
Do you remember...

914
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:07,860
...on that roof, after you caught me...

915
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:11,230
...the last thing I said to you?

916
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,490
You said, "I'm sorry."

917
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,930
I wish I hadn't.

918
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:24,280
That was my last thought.

919
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,520
I wished I had one more chance...

920
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,650
...to say what really mattered.

921
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:38,060
To say how much I loved you.

922
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:43,870
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

923
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:51,610
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

924
01:35:57,650 --> 01:36:00,170
But you brought me back.

925
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,350
You gave me my wish.

926
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:12,720
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

927
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,270
Kiss me.

928
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,000
Once more...

929
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,110
...kiss me.

930
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:58,600
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

931
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,070
Get that damn thing mounted!

932
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,640
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

933
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:24,900
Neo...

934
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,600
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

935
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:38,490
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

936
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:42,500
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

937
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:47,970
Speak.

938
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:51,680
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

939
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:55,250
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

940
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,750
You cannot stop him.

941
01:39:58,850 --> 01:40:01,190
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

942
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:04,520
We need nothing!

943
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:09,530
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

944
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,500
What do you want?

945
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,170
Peace.

946
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:46,900
What are they doing?

947
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,470
What are you doing?

948
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:59,580
Morpheus!

949
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,930
And if you fail?

950
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:30,170
I won't.

951
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:53,190
Neo.

952
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:55,060
He fights for us.

953
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:39,680
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

954
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,980
We missed you.

955
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,020
You like what I've done with the place?

956
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,320
It ends tonight.

957
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:55,250
I know it does. I've seen it.

958
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:59,200
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

959
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:03,000
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

960
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,220
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

961
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:00,820
...closing in on you?

962
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:03,150
Oh, I can.

963
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:08,620
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

964
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,390
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

965
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,330
The purpose of life is to end.

966
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:54,120
Why, Mr. Anderson?

967
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:58,230
Why, why, why?

968
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:59,620
Why do you do it?

969
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,390
Why? Why get up?

970
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,360
Why keep fighting?

971
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,390
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

972
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:11,230
For more than your survival?

973
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:14,710
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

974
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:19,910
Is it freedom or truth?

975
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,450
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

976
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:26,020
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

977
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:29,480
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

978
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:34,490
...trying desperately to justify an existence
that is without meaning or purpose!

979
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:38,120
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

980
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:44,430
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

981
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:50,400
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.

982
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:53,780
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.

983
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,780
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

984
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:05,290
Because I choose to.

985
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:13,320
This is my world! My world!

986
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:39,720
Wait.

987
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:42,050
I've seen this.

988
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,560
This is it. This is the end.

989
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:51,130
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

990
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,630
And I...

991
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:59,640
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

992
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:01,470
I say:

993
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:05,170
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

994
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,650
What? What did I just say?

995
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,870
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

996
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:36,000
Get away from me!

997
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:37,610
What are you afraid of?

998
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:39,710
It's a trick.

999
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:42,610
You were right, Smith.

1000
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,380
You were always right.

1001
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:50,350
It was inevitable.

1002
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,750
Is it over?

1003
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,160
Oh, no, no, no.

1004
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,850
No, it's not fair.

1005
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:55,480
It is done.

1006
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:29,750
It doesn't make sense.

1007
01:55:33,690 --> 01:55:35,350
He did it.

1008
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,350
He saved us.

1009
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:40,790
He saved us.

1010
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,630
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1011
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:46,200
He did it! It's over!

1012
01:55:46,370 --> 01:55:48,860
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1013
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:52,560
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1014
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:54,210
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1015
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,310
The machines, they're gone.

1016
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,810
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1017
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:04,820
Zion! Zion!

1018
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:06,750
Zion, it's over!

1019
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,550
It's over!

1020
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:11,390
The war is over!

1021
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,390
The war is over!

1022
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:38,690
I have imagined this moment...

1023
01:56:39,190 --> 01:56:41,490
...for so long.

1024
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,160
Is this real?

1025
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:58,770
Neo, wherever you are...

1026
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:01,830
...thank you.

1027
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:47,020
Good morning.

1028
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:12,210
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1029
01:58:12,610 --> 01:58:14,780
You played a very dangerous game.

1030
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:17,210
Change always is.

1031
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:21,120
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1032
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,690
As long as it can.

1033
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:29,950
What about the others?

1034
01:58:31,630 --> 01:58:33,030
What others?

1035
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:34,860
The ones that want out.

1036
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,730
Obviously, they will be freed.

1037
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:39,970
I have your word?

1038
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:43,910
What do you think I am? Human?

1039
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:59,490
Oracle!

1040
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:08,500
We were afraid we might not find you.

1041
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:11,330
Everything's okay now.

1042
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,600
Look, look.

1043
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:16,610
Just look at that.

1044
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:19,910
Beautiful.

1045
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:23,250
Did you do that?

1046
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:25,750
For Neo.

1047
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:28,080
That's nice.

1048
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:29,950
I know he'd love it.

1049
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:32,580
Will we ever see him again?

1050
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:35,930
I suspect so.

1051
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:37,830
Someday.

1052
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,400
Did you always know?

1053
01:59:44,570 --> 01:59:47,870
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1054
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,940
But I believed.

1055
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:54,280
I believed.
