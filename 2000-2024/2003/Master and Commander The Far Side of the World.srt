1
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,758
Come on. It's all right.

2
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,052
Yes, it's all right.

3
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,104
Wake up, Will.

4
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,154
Starboard bow ahoy.

5
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,040
- What is it, Slade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.

6
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,209
Sounded like a bell.

7
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,007
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.

8
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,051
Mr Calamy, the lead, if you please.

9
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,154
- By the mark, five fathom.
- Five fathom.

10
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,630
Sand and broken shell.

11
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,764
What is it?

12
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,477
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.

13
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,604
What was it? A sail?

14
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:59,192
- I don't know what it was.
- Should we beat to quarters?

15
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,828
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.

16
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,915
Hollom, you must make a decision.

17
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,752
We shall beat to quarters.

18
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,132
Rouse up. Sleepers awake.

19
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,472
Move. Move along.

20
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,684
Jump to it, boys. Jump to it.

21
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,062
Light along there.

22
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,460
Sighting in heavy fog.

23
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,089
- Handsomely on the yards tackle.
- Topmen aloft.

24
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,142
Where away?

25
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,980
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.

26
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,861
- You sure, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,323
Man-of-war?

28
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,201
I don't know, sir.

29
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,122
It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.

30
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,337
- Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
- No, sir.

31
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:49,093
You did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.

32
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,931
The deck's yours, Tom.

33
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,474
Sir.

34
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,772
Clear away. And launch boats.

35
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,574
- Quit your dawdling.
- You heard the man.

36
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,118
Lower away.

37
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,083
Haul both your yard tackles.

38
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,171
Strike the bell.

39
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,742
Down. All hands down.

40
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,261
Hands to your stations.
Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.

41
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,232
18-pounders. We'll have to get closer.
Run out the starboard battery.

42
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,111
Mr Allen, come up on the wind.
Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.

43
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,536
Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.

44
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,206
Sergeant. Take your section
into the main top.

45
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,250
We stand tall on the quarterdeck.
All of us.

46
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,338
- Mr Boyle, run up the colours.
- Aye, sir.

47
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,305
Note for the log, Mr Watt.
"Engaged enemy frigate at six bells."

48
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,437
- Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.

49
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,940
Bill.

50
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,901
Leave the swords.
Get the captain's silver below.

51
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:14,030
She's not in range yet.
Stand fast till she's close enough.

52
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,951
- Close with him amidships.
- Midships it is, sir.

53
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,954
For God's sake, don't drop anything.

54
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,460
Steady.

55
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,089
- Hold your positions.
- Hold your position. Courage, now.

56
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:36,553
- Hold steady, boys.
- Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet.

57
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:41,015
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

58
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,767
Aye, sir.

59
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,395
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.

60
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,231
Clear the forward pin rails.

61
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,281
More sand on the floor.

62
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,951
On the up-roll, fire!

63
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,632
Down!

64
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,146
Relieving-tackles on the tiller.
You men, collect these wounded.

65
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:35,361
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
- Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell.

66
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,806
Sir. To the taffrail.

67
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,441
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer.

68
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,818
We're fish in a barrel.

69
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,411
Why are we not firing?

70
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,376
Let me through.

71
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,962
Here, Joe.

72
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,130
Hold it in there.

73
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:45,598
- He's on the larboard bow, sir.
- Bring up your small arms.

74
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,187
Prepare to repel boarders.

75
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,440
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.

76
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,861
Your orders, sir?

77
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,200
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.

78
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,870
Put us in that fog, Tom.

79
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,383
Pull together, men.

80
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,594
Pull for the fog bank.

81
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,514
Run 'em out.

82
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,562
Fire!

83
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,901
She's opened up a seam.
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

84
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,737
Joe, a mallet and some irons.

85
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,870
She's gaining on us.

86
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,923
- We're nearly there, boys.
- Pull.

87
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,218
- Reach for it, men.
- We're home inside that fog.

88
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,307
Fire!

89
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,811
Pull for Lucky Jack.

90
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,064
We've done it.

91
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,236
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

92
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,290
They'll not find us in here.

93
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,002
Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.

94
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,199
Avast rowing.

95
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,538
Well done, lads.

96
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,899
Two feet six inches, sir, and holding.

97
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,280
- Good work, Mr Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.

98
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,001
So, what's the butcher's bill?

99
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,670
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

100
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,389
Joe Plaice.

101
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:18,811
He has a severely depressed fracture of
the skull. I don't think he'll see out the night.

102
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,689
Lord Blakeney.

103
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,361
Just a broken arm, sir.

104
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,615
You're in very good hands.

105
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,915
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.

106
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,378
His father would've understood.
He knew the life. His mother, however...

107
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,965
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.

108
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,925
What?

109
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,766
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.

110
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,980
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

111
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,315
Damn fine gunnery.

112
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:09,946
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

113
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,784
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

114
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:21,666
I have no idea what it is you're talking about,
but he did seem to come off rather well.

115
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:27,922
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.

116
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,429
The French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.

117
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,931
Indeed.

118
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:44,230
If he knew we were looking for him, he could
have stood to sea and passed well clear.

119
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,483
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.

120
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,221
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman.

121
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,265
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonour in it.

122
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,601
She was more like a ship of the line.

123
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,021
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

124
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,732
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.

125
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,569
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

126
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,239
What is the weather gauge?

127
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,867
- Shall I show you again, Stephen?
- Not on the cloth.

128
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:44,082
It means she had the wind in her favour,
therefore control of the engagement.

129
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,502
And she had longer guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.

130
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,256
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.

131
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:58,805
- Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific...
- Could tip the war in Napoleon's favour.

132
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:04,435
By comparison, the <i>Surprise</i>
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

133
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,944
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me an aged man of war?

134
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,364
The <i>Surprise</i> is not old.
No one would call her old.

135
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:22,620
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.
She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.

136
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:26,082
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

137
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,293
No, she's not old.

138
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,629
She's in her prime.

139
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:36,301
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.

140
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,471
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.

141
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,391
We're not going home.

142
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,487
But to refit we need a port,
and the <i>Acheron</i> may be still looking for us.

143
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,909
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.

144
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:06,873
As you said, she is taking the war to
the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.

145
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:14,214
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.

146
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,843
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.

147
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,597
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.

148
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,202
Is it true they put the last stitch
through your nose?

149
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,371
What do you mean?

150
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:52,752
Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your
hammock with the last stitch in your nose,

151
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,047
just to make sure you're not asleep.

152
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:03,137
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?

153
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,324
It's all right.
It's just the laudanum speaking.

154
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,693
I've never seen a braver patient.

155
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,577
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

156
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,621
I want good work now.

157
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:56,209
I'll need two men into the starboard
forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.

158
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,378
That's nice work there.

159
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,756
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.

160
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,808
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.

161
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,479
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.

162
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,439
He's known this ship man and boy.

163
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:23,736
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.

164
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,074
I do understand your point.
Your knowledge is beyond question.

165
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:33,580
However, a week in the Brazilian rainforest
looking for a new mast simply will not do.

166
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,915
The <i>Acheron</i> will be halfway to China.

167
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:41,754
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which
is all I can hope to expect from any man.

168
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,582
Is them his brains?

169
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:21,544
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.

170
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:30,220
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.

171
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,473
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.

172
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,939
He wouldn't look at you
for under ten guineas on land.

173
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,191
And he knows his birds and beasts.

174
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,653
You show him a beetle
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.

175
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,281
Back to work, you loafers.
Eckhart, use your pipe.

176
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,784
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

177
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:56,663
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here.

178
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,838
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

179
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:14,264
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?

180
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,432
Much better, thank you, sir.

181
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,601
Well, good. Good.

182
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:24,607
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I...

183
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,367
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.

184
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,369
Thank you, sir.

185
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,164
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

186
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,960
I had the honour of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.

187
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:50,133
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.

188
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,428
Yes.

189
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,229
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?

190
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,442
You should read the book.

191
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,111
I will, sir. Thank you.

192
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,929
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

193
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:39,933
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

194
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,653
How about this?

195
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:56,199
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?

196
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,733
Salute.

197
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,735
Hats off.

198
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,072
What's all this about?

199
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:24,162
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.

200
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:28,041
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the <i>Acheron,</i> sir.

201
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,044
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.

202
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:36,299
In Boston, sir. During the peace.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.

203
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,303
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,

204
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,639
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

205
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:47,977
Sir, I saw there was something right strange
about her, so I asked Joe...

206
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:51,356
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.

207
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:56,194
- And this framing is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.

208
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,863
- Thank you, lads.
- Thank you, sir.

209
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,200
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.

210
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,702
Thank you very much, sir.

211
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,789
- Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
- We'll drink wine.

212
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,999
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day.

213
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,752
Bluff above the water and sharp below.

214
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:18,258
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

215
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,969
Heavier, but fast despite it.

216
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:27,350
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we live in.

217
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,312
Planking and framing like that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

218
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:36,359
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

219
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:40,363
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.

220
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,408
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

221
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:49,539
Even if we did catch up with her,
I mean, to take her...

222
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:53,751
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.

223
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:59,799
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.

224
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:16,566
Hello, darling. How much for a kiss?

225
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,360
<i>Quanto</i> cost-o kiss-o?

226
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,655
- Name?
- My name is Maria.

227
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,034
Give us arrows. I give axe. Quick, mate.

228
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,369
Thank you, mate.

229
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,923
Gangway for the mail, please.

230
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,469
Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.

231
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,847
What's he saying?

232
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:55,271
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.

233
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,862
Somewhere here.

234
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,532
A full three weeks ahead.

235
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,492
Damn.

236
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,204
All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.

237
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:15,208
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar.
Let us complete our business here.

238
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,044
Hands, prepare to weigh anchor.

239
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:27,220
Put that woman down, Slade. This is a ship
of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello.

240
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:34,018
All hands, get these provisions stowed.

241
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,241
Well done.

242
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,410
Gentlemen.

243
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:56,416
To wives and to sweethearts.

244
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:59,878
May they never meet.

245
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:03,882
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.

246
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,801
Sir?

247
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:12,223
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

248
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:17,228
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,
not much older than you are now.

249
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:20,899
And Mr Pullings was
a snivelling midshipman,

250
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,359
still yearning for hearth and home.

251
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,613
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's like?

252
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:29,824
I have had the honour
of dining with him twice.

253
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,785
He spoke to me on both occasions.

254
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,039
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.

255
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:41,377
He always said in battle "Never mind
the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em."

256
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:45,632
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

257
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:48,760
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.

258
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,222
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

259
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:58,269
The first time that he spoke to me,

260
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:03,566
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

261
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,403
He leaned across the table,
he looked me straight in the eye,

262
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:12,158
and he said "Aubrey,
may I trouble you for the salt?"

263
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:19,374
I've always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.

264
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:30,552
The second time,
the second time he told me a story

265
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:34,180
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

266
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:39,143
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.

267
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:43,898
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.

268
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:48,027
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,

269
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:53,408
you'd cry out "What pitiful stuff"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

270
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,577
But with Nelson,

271
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,290
you felt your heart glow.

272
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:11,593
- Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
- You did indeed, sir.

273
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:18,641
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.

274
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:22,061
To Lord Nelson.

275
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:29,194
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

276
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:30,820
I do.

277
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,239
Which would you choose?

278
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:40,163
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.

279
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,665
If you had to choose.

280
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:46,211
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other...

281
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:49,923
Well then, if you're going to push me,

282
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:55,220
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

283
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:59,057
It has significant advantage
in both length and breadth.

284
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,477
There, I have you.
You're completely dished.

285
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,483
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the lesser of two weevils?

286
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:18,576
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

287
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,330
Really. Weevils.

288
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:27,752
To the lesser of two weevils.

289
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:41,349
Yay, Joe.

290
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,979
Go on, Joe.

291
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,916
The Lord taketh,

292
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,045
and the Lord giveth away.

293
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:14,007
You hear that? He said something.

294
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,968
Doctor. He spoke, Doctor.

295
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,970
Well done indeed, Stephen.

296
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,056
Adieu to you Spanish ladies

297
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,269
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain

298
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:31,274
For we've received orders
to sail for old England

299
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:37,530
We hope in a short time
to see you again

300
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:42,577
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.

301
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,205
Indeed.

302
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,042
Come, all you bold young thoughtless men

303
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,628
A warning take by me

304
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:56,216
And never leave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea

305
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:11,189
On deck there. Sail ho.

306
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:14,359
Looks like a frigate.

307
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:21,074
How did it get there?

308
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:24,827
- We must turn and fight.
- But he has the weather gauge again.

309
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:28,206
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.

310
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:35,713
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.

311
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,799
Run like smoke and oakum.

312
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:41,803
- We'll have to bend every sail.
- We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to.

313
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:45,848
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.

314
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,976
All hands, make sail.

315
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:52,981
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.

316
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:14,627
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.

317
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,130
You better hold fast.

318
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,555
What is it with this man?

319
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:31,436
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?

320
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,563
He fights like you, Jack.

321
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,084
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

322
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:59,380
When its lower limb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, look to your sextant.

323
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:03,343
When the orb is no longer rising,

324
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:07,013
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.

325
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:09,474
- Sir?
- Mr Pullings.

326
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,768
- Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

327
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,354
Call noon. It's your class.

328
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:20,026
- Sir, that's noon.
- Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

329
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,445
Six hours?

330
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,781
Five at most.

331
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:28,826
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.

332
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,881
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.

333
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:45,426
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.

334
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:51,599
- Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
- Your first command.

335
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:59,899
Quickly. She'll be on top of us.

336
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,902
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

337
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:05,280
Fend her off.

338
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,866
Lower away on the main.

339
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:18,001
- Wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.

340
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:34,642
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

341
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:39,022
Lively now.
We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.

342
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:49,032
- Mind what the captain told you.
- Pull, boys. That's it.

343
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:13,640
Now.

344
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:22,232
Killick there. Douse your light.

345
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,281
Mr Allen, make ready.

346
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,908
Hello. We caught a fish.

347
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,370
Take the helm, Bonden.

348
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:21,165
- Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:25,628
Hard a'larboard.

350
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:59,037
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I'll take this watch.

351
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,747
Aye, sir.

352
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,418
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.
You know his orders.

353
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:07,587
Well done, sir.

354
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,968
She's a right phantom, she is. The way
she come up again, right behind us like that.

355
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:19,390
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.

356
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,976
With our shot bouncin' off her.

357
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,021
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.

358
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:29,192
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'll have her.

359
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:32,195
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.

360
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:37,242
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

361
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:41,871
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.

362
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:44,749
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies

363
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:47,502
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.

364
00:43:47,585 --> 00:43:51,256
They go after rich merchantmen and the like.

365
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:55,093
But think on our share of the prize money.

366
00:43:55,176 --> 00:44:00,181
She'll be loaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

367
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:03,768
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.

368
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:06,187
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

369
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,233
And I've never met a live one
that you bought one for, neither.

370
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:17,740
Sitting up all night, catching your death
of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.

371
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:19,909
Thank you, Killick.

372
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,291
Bonden.

373
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:29,544
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'-sou'west.

374
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:33,631
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.

375
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:40,138
Sail.

376
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:43,433
Two points off starboard bow.

377
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:46,436
Three cheers for Lucky Jack.

378
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:54,944
She's ours, boys.

379
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:08,875
Foul. You got away before me.

380
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,007
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

381
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,593
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

382
00:45:18,676 --> 00:45:20,637
I've never seen the like.

383
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,682
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.

384
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:28,937
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

385
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,357
Told you it would work, Will.
We'll have them by nightfall.

386
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,944
- I think we've got him, sir.
- And the wind favours us this time.

387
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:39,322
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.

388
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:44,327
Still, if we can close this gap
and get up behind her, she may well be ours.

389
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,788
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

390
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:50,875
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.

391
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:08,184
Turn.

392
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:12,105
Move along, man.
We'll have lost him before you rig it up.

393
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:14,315
Hold.

394
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:18,695
- 12 knots, sir.
- That's 12 knots. That's good.

395
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:23,449
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

396
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:26,828
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

397
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:31,124
All hands on starboard rail.

398
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:35,169
Come up the larboard topsail sheets.

399
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:57,275
- We're crackin' on.
- We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it.

400
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,988
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.

401
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,580
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft.

402
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:12,373
No lounging, boy.

403
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:18,171
Lifelines, fore and aft.
Double-grape that launch.

404
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:22,800
Cape Horn, Doctor.

405
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:41,611
Close the lid.
There's enough water in the grog.

406
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:43,571
Thank you for that, Davies.

407
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:48,535
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

408
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:51,079
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.

409
00:47:51,162 --> 00:47:55,708
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's leadin' us right into a trap.

410
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,965
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

411
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:05,009
I'll not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.

412
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,137
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the log.

413
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:14,477
Sail trimmers to their stations.
Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.

414
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:16,729
Give 'em a pull and belay.

415
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:35,707
We're closing on her, Tom.
I'll not give up now.

416
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,043
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.

417
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,754
Sou'west by west, sir.

418
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:44,632
Mr Calamy.

419
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:47,427
Idlers and waisters below.

420
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:54,017
We're for the Horn, boys.

421
00:48:57,979 --> 00:48:59,939
Close reef topsails.

422
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,205
Lively, lads.

423
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,297
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom.

424
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,684
Johansson, Truelove. To the mizzen.

425
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:40,021
All secure.

426
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,065
Down ye go, lads.

427
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:53,243
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.

428
00:49:56,704 --> 00:50:00,083
- I'll need more men, sir.
- Yes. Go.

429
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:12,136
Mr Hollom, sir. Help me.

430
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:22,605
Tudor, Ellers. To Mr Allen.

431
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:27,694
You men, lay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along.

432
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,704
Help.

433
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:42,792
Help me.

434
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:51,426
Man overboard.

435
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:57,098
Mizzen's gone. Hands to the taffrail.

436
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:11,070
He's over there, sir.

437
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:14,824
Swim for the wreckage, man. Swim.

438
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,327
Over here.

439
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:22,707
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.

440
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,920
She's broaching. We're losing her.

441
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:30,340
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor.

442
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:33,968
We must cut it loose.
It's going to sink us.

443
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:37,889
Sir, he's going to make it. He can do it.

444
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:42,018
- Come on, Will.
- Come on. Hand over hand.

445
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:47,273
For God's sake, Will, swim.
Swim for the wreckage, Will.

446
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:57,825
You can do it, Will.

447
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:02,080
- Swim. Come on.
- Come on, Will. Swim.

448
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:35,149
- He's been at it again.
- Who's that, then?

449
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:38,069
- The Jonah.
- What's that?

450
00:54:48,454 --> 00:54:52,917
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.

451
00:54:53,626 --> 00:55:00,675
For my own part, those who die under my
knife, or from some subsequent infection,

452
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:06,681
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.

453
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,477
That young man was a casualty of war.

454
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:18,443
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the lesser of two evils.

455
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:20,612
Weevils.

456
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:28,453
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.

457
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:32,624
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?

458
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:42,926
Jack, before answering,
I'm compelled to ask,

459
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:47,138
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?

460
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,851
To the captain I'd say
there's little I detest more than an informer.

461
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:55,188
- Now you're talking like an Irishman.
- I am an Irishman.

462
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:57,315
As a friend, then.

463
00:55:57,398 --> 00:56:03,238
As a friend, I would say that I have never once
doubted your abilities as a captain.

464
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:05,240
Speak plainly, Stephen.

465
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:11,746
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.

466
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:15,708
The men, of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

467
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:18,044
rightfully confident of victory.

468
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:23,758
But therein lies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.

469
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:31,516
And chasing this larger, faster ship with
its long guns is beginning to smack of pride.

470
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,019
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.

471
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,564
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.

472
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:42,277
Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world
through a microscope is your prerogative.

473
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,906
This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever
grist the mill requires to fulfil my duty.

474
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,367
Whatever the cost?

475
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,703
Whatever the cost.

476
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:54,581
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

477
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:58,960
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?

478
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,546
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.

479
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:07,927
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a long time ago.

480
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:12,223
Got it.

481
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:18,771
The wind's backing, sir.

482
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:22,901
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any longer.

483
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:29,532
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.

484
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:32,619
How far south, sir?

485
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:36,247
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

486
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:38,791
- Aye, sir.
- Lively.

487
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:44,047
- Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
- Due south, sir.

488
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:49,761
Heave. Steady.

489
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:29,384
Clearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a loss.

490
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:33,972
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.

491
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:36,140
To the sun.

492
00:58:38,768 --> 00:58:42,397
And by way of anticipation of this event,

493
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,111
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.

494
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:52,490
- Killick. Killick there.
- I'm already here, ain't I?

495
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:59,205
Gentlemen, I give you,

496
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:02,292
our destination.

497
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:12,343
- It's the Galápagos Islands.
- The Galápagos Islands.

498
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,223
Our whaling fleet is there.

499
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:22,770
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

500
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:28,568
That's where the <i>Acheron</i> will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.

501
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:31,321
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me,

502
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:34,407
a slice of Albemarle.

503
00:59:35,366 --> 00:59:38,995
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

504
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,413
Perfect.

505
00:59:40,496 --> 00:59:43,249
And the <i>Acheron</i> for me.

506
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:54,677
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

507
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:59,724
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

508
00:59:59,807 --> 01:00:06,064
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

509
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:11,486
Don't forget your old shipmates

510
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:16,991
We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division

511
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:22,747
Sponger I, and loader you
Through the whole commission

512
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:29,212
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

513
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:36,553
Don't forget your old shipmates

514
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:27,687
The Enchanted Isles. They're said
to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.

515
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:31,608
When we get there,
we'll have to stop for food and water.

516
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:35,653
I promise you, during that time -
several days at least -

517
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:40,158
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.

518
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:44,746
You'll be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I'll wager.

519
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:48,208
I would like that of all things.

520
01:01:51,836 --> 01:01:55,089
- Is it an insect?
- Yes.

521
01:01:56,925 --> 01:02:01,763
Doesn't look like one.
I mean, it looks like a stick.

522
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:04,933
Yes, that's the whole point.

523
01:02:05,016 --> 01:02:08,978
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

524
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:17,654
There's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.

525
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:25,036
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.

526
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,748
Did God make them change?

527
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:32,210
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.

528
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:35,755
But do they also change themselves?

529
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:38,633
Now that is a question, isn't it?

530
01:02:40,718 --> 01:02:43,388
Sir, we've raised the Galápagos.

531
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:45,557
I'm coming.

532
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:24,220
- Look. Beyond the rock.
- Yes, I see.

533
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,974
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?

534
01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:33,521
- There's an ugly devil.
- Disgusting. It's got warts all over it.

535
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:36,566
Ugly devils, aren't they?

536
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:40,195
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and lizards.

537
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:43,198
What, no women? It ain't natural.

538
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:46,409
How extraordinary.

539
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:48,328
What is, sir?

540
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:52,457
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.

541
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,210
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

542
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:58,880
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.

543
01:03:58,963 --> 01:04:02,759
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

544
01:04:03,384 --> 01:04:07,847
They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.

545
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:11,017
- Will you catch one?
- A pair of them, I should think.

546
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,312
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.

547
01:04:14,395 --> 01:04:18,107
- Look. There's one going for a swim.
- Iguanas don't swim.

548
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:20,443
These ones do.

549
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:31,621
I'll be damned.

550
01:04:31,704 --> 01:04:37,961
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.

551
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:06,322
All hands about ship. Off tacks and sheets.
Prepare the mainsail to haul.

552
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:19,168
- Aubrey.
- Hogg. Master of the <i>Albatross.</i>

553
01:05:19,252 --> 01:05:22,714
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.

554
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:26,676
- Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
- Aye, sir.

555
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:30,221
- Mr Howard, stand your men down.
- Royal Marines, trail arms.

556
01:05:31,097 --> 01:05:34,142
We was coming back for fresh lines
no more than a week ago.

557
01:05:34,225 --> 01:05:39,689
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody
ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates.

558
01:05:39,772 --> 01:05:42,066
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

559
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:46,279
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.

560
01:05:46,362 --> 01:05:51,576
£12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they
took. We been out more than two years.

561
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:53,578
And her course?

562
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:56,831
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.

563
01:05:56,915 --> 01:06:00,126
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.

564
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:03,421
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.

565
01:06:03,504 --> 01:06:05,757
All hands, make sail.

566
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,885
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?

567
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:12,096
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.

568
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:32,283
- Have you forgotten your promise?
- Subject to the requirements of the service.

569
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:35,578
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.

570
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:39,123
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.

571
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:43,253
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.

572
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:46,464
As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.

573
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:50,093
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.

574
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:54,097
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.

575
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:58,142
I could walk briskly, pausing only
for important measurements.

576
01:06:58,226 --> 01:07:02,397
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.

577
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,568
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.

578
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:09,863
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.

579
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:15,243
I see. So after all this time in your service,

580
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:20,206
I must simply content myself
to form part of this belligerent expedition,

581
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:25,295
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power...

582
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:28,965
- You forget yourself, Doctor.
- No, Jack.

583
01:07:29,048 --> 01:07:33,344
You've forgotten yourself. For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.

584
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:37,765
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht.

585
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:41,978
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir.

586
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,383
All right.

587
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:19,933
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.

588
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:23,269
Davies, don't leave them there.
Get them below.

589
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:25,021
Mr Blakeney.

590
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:29,317
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.

591
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:35,365
I think it's a Galápagos beetle.

592
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:38,159
I'm sure of it.

593
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:44,541
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.

594
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:50,046
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

595
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:53,216
You can have it, sir.

596
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:12,193
Mr Blakeney.

597
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:16,406
- Thank you.
- Sir.

598
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:31,880
Last gun fired, sir.

599
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:35,592
- Timing?
- Two minutes and one second, sir.

600
01:09:35,675 --> 01:09:41,014
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

601
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:44,309
- Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
- No.

602
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:47,604
- Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
- No.

603
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:50,440
- Want your children to sing <i>The Marseillaise?</i>
- No.

604
01:09:50,523 --> 01:09:53,776
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery.

605
01:09:56,821 --> 01:10:00,116
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

606
01:10:02,785 --> 01:10:06,122
- Mark your targets.
- Come on, lads, faster now.

607
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,291
Come on, swab it.

608
01:10:20,094 --> 01:10:22,514
Heave.

609
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:25,808
- Report, Mr Mowett.
- Third and fourth divisions ready.

610
01:10:25,892 --> 01:10:28,770
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

611
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:04,848
One minute and ten seconds.

612
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:09,352
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.

613
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:15,942
Gangway for the captain, lads.

614
01:11:16,025 --> 01:11:18,695
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

615
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,864
Thank you, sir.

616
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:32,667
Killick. Killick there.
What do you have for us tonight?

617
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,295
Which it's soused hog's face.

618
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:40,049
- Which it is soused hog's face.
- My favourite.

619
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:46,764
And when they run, the <i>Surprise</i>
will blow her to kingdom come.

620
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:46,491
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.

621
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:48,743
I can't make it rain.

622
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:54,165
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.

623
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:56,834
I have never known such a run of bad luck.

624
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:19,190
"And they said unto him
'For what caused the evil?"'

625
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:25,363
Where'd that come from?

626
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:31,202
It's from the Bible, that. That is
from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.

627
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:35,164
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -

628
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:38,293
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.

629
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:44,007
Evil comes from him
who evil thinks and evil is.

630
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:48,803
No. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

631
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,349
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

632
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:10,491
It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

633
01:14:10,575 --> 01:14:15,205
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

634
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:19,083
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?

635
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,067
You there. Stand fast.

636
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:50,365
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.

637
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:53,993
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

638
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:55,787
Aye, sir.

639
01:14:57,205 --> 01:15:00,542
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

640
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:07,840
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?

641
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:10,844
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...

642
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:16,140
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.

643
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:19,310
I've tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,

644
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:22,856
but they've taken a set against me.

645
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:28,361
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.

646
01:15:28,444 --> 01:15:31,364
I'll set that to rights.
I'll be much tougher on them.

647
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:34,993
You don't make friends
with the foremastjacks, lad.

648
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:39,372
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.

649
01:15:39,455 --> 01:15:43,167
- Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
- No, sir.

650
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:45,545
I'm very sorry, sir.

651
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:49,048
- You're 26? 27?
- I'm 30 next Friday, sir.

652
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:50,717
30?

653
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,053
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

654
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:59,017
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.

655
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,729
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

656
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:07,692
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.

657
01:16:07,775 --> 01:16:09,819
Strength.

658
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:15,366
You find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.

659
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:20,538
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.

660
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,417
Yes, sir.

661
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:29,589
Strength, respect and discipline, sir.

662
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:37,472
It's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

663
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:41,309
Damned unfortunate.

664
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,938
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

665
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:52,195
- I am not a flogging captain.
- Hollom is a scapegoat for all the bad luck,

666
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:55,573
real or imagined, on this voyage.

667
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:58,201
Mr Lamb? If you please.

668
01:16:58,284 --> 01:17:01,538
They're exhausted.
These men are exhausted.

669
01:17:01,621 --> 01:17:04,499
You've pushed them too hard.

670
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:08,253
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.

671
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:12,632
Not to criticise nor to comment
on my command.

672
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:18,263
Shall I leave you until you're in
a more harmonious frame of mind?

673
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:23,309
- What would you have me do?
- Tip the ship's grog over the side.

674
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:26,855
- Stop their grog?
- Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

675
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:30,233
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

676
01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:33,486
I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind
than face a mutiny.

677
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,864
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.

678
01:17:35,947 --> 01:17:40,785
Men pressed from their homes, confined
for months aboard a wooden prison...

679
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:47,667
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.

680
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:53,381
I hate it when you talk of the service
in this way. It makes me so very low.

681
01:17:53,464 --> 01:17:55,216
You think I want to flog Nagle?

682
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,887
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?

683
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:01,848
Under my orders?

684
01:18:01,931 --> 01:18:06,269
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work...

685
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:08,771
Jack, the man failed to salute.

686
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:11,566
There's hierarchies even in nature.

687
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:16,905
- There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
- Men must be governed.

688
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:19,532
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.

689
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:23,912
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,
from Nero to Bonaparte.

690
01:18:23,995 --> 01:18:28,124
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.

691
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:32,670
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.

692
01:18:35,506 --> 01:18:37,342
Four.

693
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:40,178
Five.

694
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:44,140
Six.

695
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:47,185
Seven.

696
01:18:48,436 --> 01:18:49,979
Eight.

697
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,440
Nine.

698
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:56,694
Ten.

699
01:18:57,779 --> 01:18:58,988
Eleven.

700
01:19:01,032 --> 01:19:02,992
Twelve.

701
01:19:05,995 --> 01:19:08,206
Cut him down.

702
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:34,524
Not so loud.

703
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,331
Put that dirk down, Boyle.

704
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,419
You OK, Mr Hollom?

705
01:20:36,502 --> 01:20:39,589
- He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
- Shut up.

706
01:20:39,672 --> 01:20:42,759
- You shut up.
- Just leave him be.

707
01:20:42,842 --> 01:20:45,845
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

708
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,393
Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

709
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:05,490
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.

710
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:10,954
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.

711
01:21:11,621 --> 01:21:14,707
My God. You believe it too.

712
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,837
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

713
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:28,263
It's him, innit?

714
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,852
The Jonah.

715
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:35,937
He's causing it.

716
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:41,693
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

717
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:46,447
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.

718
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:52,579
You wait and see.

719
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:57,667
Any time tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

720
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:03,631
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.

721
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:26,654
Mr Hollom.

722
01:22:26,738 --> 01:22:29,449
You gave me such a start.

723
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,078
Are you feeling better now?

724
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:37,707
Yes. Much better, thank you.

725
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:53,389
The captain thinks
we'll get our wind tomorrow.

726
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,558
I'm sure of it.

727
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:28,049
You've always been very kind to me.

728
01:23:35,139 --> 01:23:37,559
Goodbye, Blakeney.

729
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:50,632
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.

730
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:53,676
But we are all God's creatures.

731
01:24:56,429 --> 01:25:00,767
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

732
01:25:01,684 --> 01:25:04,395
or spoke ill of him,

733
01:25:06,105 --> 01:25:09,734
or failed him in respect of fellowship,

734
01:25:10,985 --> 01:25:14,531
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

735
01:25:14,614 --> 01:25:16,783
And we ask for his.

736
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:35,134
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

737
01:26:00,493 --> 01:26:02,954
Avast there.

738
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:19,804
- Doctor, have you seen the bird?
- What sort of bird?

739
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:26,853
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or
he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.

740
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:37,113
There he is. My bird. Damn.

741
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:40,742
It's circling, lads.

742
01:26:47,874 --> 01:26:48,917
Doctor?

743
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,336
My God. Doctor.

744
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:57,592
I'm so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

745
01:27:00,303 --> 01:27:03,556
- Calamy, get Higgins.
- I'm fine, Jack.

746
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:19,864
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.

747
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:24,994
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.

748
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,038
Are you equal to the task?

749
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:33,211
I'll need to read up on the doctor's books.
Study some pictures he has.

750
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:35,213
Study some pictures?

751
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:38,383
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

752
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:45,098
It'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You wouldn't have the...

753
01:27:45,181 --> 01:27:47,684
I'll manage. You'll see.

754
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:15,837
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

755
01:28:16,379 --> 01:28:19,257
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

756
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:25,180
Better get...

757
01:28:26,556 --> 01:28:28,641
Goodbye, sir.

758
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:50,997
No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

759
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:01,716
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

760
01:29:40,129 --> 01:29:42,632
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

761
01:29:42,715 --> 01:29:47,846
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.

762
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:51,975
Gently there.

763
01:29:58,731 --> 01:30:02,527
Briskly now. Secure this line.

764
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:05,905
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

765
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,544
- All set, Higgins?
- Yes, sir.

766
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:22,046
No.

767
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,633
I do this with my own hand.

768
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:34,184
If everything is under control,
I'll just be outside.

769
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:37,353
A spare pair of steady hands
wouldn't go amiss.

770
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:42,942
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.

771
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:51,242
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.

772
01:30:51,784 --> 01:30:53,953
Good, then.

773
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:59,125
Put your hand on my belly,
pressing firmly when I give the word.

774
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:02,670
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

775
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:12,388
Padeen, please.

776
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:28,154
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

777
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:31,616
Swab.

778
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:43,753
All right.

779
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:49,926
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

780
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,975
Take a good grip with the square retractor.

781
01:32:00,436 --> 01:32:02,647
Right in.

782
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:04,691
And lift up.

783
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:06,234
Lift up.

784
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:21,916
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

785
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:29,340
Are you all right?

786
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:41,394
I got it.

787
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:55,325
A tad more pressure.

788
01:33:06,169 --> 01:33:08,880
- Is that all of it?
- Aye, sir.

789
01:33:09,589 --> 01:33:11,799
She'll patch up nicely.

790
01:33:11,883 --> 01:33:13,801
Thank God I got it.

791
01:33:59,597 --> 01:34:01,432
That's good.

792
01:34:09,065 --> 01:34:10,859
Sir.

793
01:34:10,942 --> 01:34:14,779
- Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
- Have you really?

794
01:34:14,863 --> 01:34:18,491
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.

795
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:21,035
Padeen, that one's got away.

796
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,373
Sir, I've made a few notes,
if you want to see them.

797
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:45,435
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.

798
01:34:45,518 --> 01:34:52,442
Perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

799
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:57,947
They don't combine too well, I find.

800
01:34:58,031 --> 01:34:59,073
Right.

801
01:34:59,157 --> 01:35:01,534
Should you really be getting up, sir?

802
01:35:01,618 --> 01:35:05,079
- Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
- No, sir.

803
01:35:05,163 --> 01:35:08,583
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

804
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:19,469
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?

805
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:23,806
- Oh, a week perhaps.
- A week?

806
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:27,936
- There's no great hurry.
- Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

807
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:30,939
I'm not even sure
it was the <i>Acheron</i> we sighted.

808
01:35:31,022 --> 01:35:36,069
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

809
01:35:36,152 --> 01:35:41,282
No, we shall head home. Before peace
breaks out with France, God forbid.

810
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:48,331
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.

811
01:35:48,414 --> 01:35:53,628
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

812
01:35:53,711 --> 01:35:58,383
A shrub? Nonsense.
I'll name a great tortoise after you.

813
01:35:58,466 --> 01:36:01,261
<i>Testudo aubreii.</i>

814
01:36:42,927 --> 01:36:46,264
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.

815
01:36:46,347 --> 01:36:49,559
- Back to camp, sir?
- No, to the other side of the island.

816
01:36:49,642 --> 01:36:54,105
- But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

817
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:57,192
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

818
01:36:57,275 --> 01:36:59,194
Come on.

819
01:37:10,121 --> 01:37:13,082
Seven inches in length.

820
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:16,127
Four inches wide.

821
01:37:16,211 --> 01:37:18,713
15-inches-long neck.

822
01:37:19,797 --> 01:37:24,135
Width at the widest point, six inches.

823
01:37:30,183 --> 01:37:33,728
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.

824
01:37:33,811 --> 01:37:36,064
Here's a good one.

825
01:37:37,815 --> 01:37:40,568
Pick them up carefully.

826
01:37:41,194 --> 01:37:44,072
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

827
01:37:44,155 --> 01:37:49,661
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

828
01:37:49,744 --> 01:37:52,413
And should it indeed prove flightless,

829
01:37:52,497 --> 01:37:56,334
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner
as co-discoverer.

830
01:39:20,084 --> 01:39:21,628
Mr Blakeney.

831
01:39:36,768 --> 01:39:39,062
Sir, we must hurry.

832
01:39:41,272 --> 01:39:46,986
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.
Leave them. Just put everything down.

833
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:53,243
Open the cages.

834
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:12,554
- All hands, unmoor ship.
- Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.

835
01:40:12,637 --> 01:40:15,849
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

836
01:40:15,932 --> 01:40:20,019
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.

837
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:25,483
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.

838
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:29,279
That can only mean King Charles Island.
He's looking for water.

839
01:40:29,362 --> 01:40:36,536
If we caught up with her, to take her,
we'd have to be bloody invisible.

840
01:40:37,745 --> 01:40:40,707
Brace the yards to starboard.

841
01:40:49,966 --> 01:40:53,094
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

842
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:57,182
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

843
01:40:57,891 --> 01:41:00,852
My greatest discovery was your phantom.

844
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:05,982
Indeed it was. I'm sorry you had to leave
the majority of your collection behind.

845
01:41:06,065 --> 01:41:12,071
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I
did make one very interesting find.

846
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:14,824
Is that right?

847
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:17,160
Let me guess. A stick?

848
01:41:24,292 --> 01:41:26,377
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

849
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:29,839
- It's a rare phasmid, sir.
- A phasmid?

850
01:41:29,923 --> 01:41:36,429
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick
in order to confuse its predators.

851
01:42:28,731 --> 01:42:30,984
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

852
01:42:31,067 --> 01:42:36,072
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.

853
01:42:36,155 --> 01:42:40,493
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.

854
01:42:40,577 --> 01:42:45,123
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.

855
01:42:45,206 --> 01:42:47,208
I see.

856
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:50,420
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.

857
01:42:50,503 --> 01:42:52,005
- Jack?
- Yes.

858
01:42:52,088 --> 01:42:54,924
You're the predator.

859
01:42:56,176 --> 01:43:01,264
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.

860
01:43:01,347 --> 01:43:03,266
That's a frigate, all right.

861
01:43:03,349 --> 01:43:06,561
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

862
01:43:06,644 --> 01:43:10,773
- Mr Allen. More smoke.
- Aye, sir.

863
01:43:10,857 --> 01:43:13,484
That'll bring 'em about.

864
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:29,125
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up
so they fly straight and true.

865
01:43:31,669 --> 01:43:34,756
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

866
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:48,728
Larboard battery,
unship your rear wheels.

867
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:55,318
Drop the gun.

868
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:02,158
- Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
- Oh, God.

869
01:44:02,242 --> 01:44:05,161
- Tom?
- Our preparations are completed, sir.

870
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:09,958
Good. Right, from now on
no "sirs", no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

871
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:11,709
Aye, sir.

872
01:44:11,793 --> 01:44:15,421
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.

873
01:44:16,339 --> 01:44:19,342
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the <i>Acheron's</i> hold.

874
01:44:19,425 --> 01:44:22,804
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.

875
01:44:22,887 --> 01:44:26,766
- You think him ready, sir?
- Were you ready, Tom?

876
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,644
- He may well turn the tide.
- Indeed, sir.

877
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:42,490
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

878
01:44:42,574 --> 01:44:46,619
Make a show of fleeing, panicky
and disorganised, like a whaler might.

879
01:44:46,703 --> 01:44:49,122
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

880
01:44:49,205 --> 01:44:51,082
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

881
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:55,420
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick
and get some whaler's slops on.

882
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:12,562
- Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
- Thank you.

883
01:45:12,645 --> 01:45:17,358
- I hear we're to free the whalers.
- You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

884
01:45:17,442 --> 01:45:19,861
I'm sorry, Will.

885
01:45:21,821 --> 01:45:27,285
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.

886
01:45:28,077 --> 01:45:31,039
- Excuse me, sir.
- Remove your hat. We're whalers.

887
01:45:31,122 --> 01:45:35,335
Mr Calamy says I'm not
on the boarding party. I want to say...

888
01:45:35,418 --> 01:45:39,506
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.

889
01:45:39,589 --> 01:45:43,968
You'll lead your gun crew, then when
we board, you'll take command of the ship.

890
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:48,431
- Do I make myself clear?
- Take command of the ship? Thank you, sir.

891
01:45:48,515 --> 01:45:51,059
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

892
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:57,440
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe.

893
01:45:57,524 --> 01:46:00,151
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

894
01:46:00,235 --> 01:46:03,988
- Is that the arm you got or don't got?
- Less of that cheek, Davies.

895
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:07,867
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.

896
01:46:07,951 --> 01:46:10,537
Make way for the captain.

897
01:46:11,913 --> 01:46:13,998
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

898
01:46:14,082 --> 01:46:15,625
Right, lads.

899
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:18,044
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

900
01:46:18,127 --> 01:46:21,923
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.

901
01:46:22,006 --> 01:46:25,593
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

902
01:46:25,677 --> 01:46:27,679
That will test our nerve.

903
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:31,850
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.

904
01:46:31,933 --> 01:46:37,355
The <i>Acheron</i> is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.

905
01:46:37,438 --> 01:46:40,692
And they will sell their lives dearly.

906
01:46:42,527 --> 01:46:46,781
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,

907
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:49,534
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.

908
01:46:49,617 --> 01:46:53,037
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.

909
01:46:53,121 --> 01:46:56,749
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

910
01:46:56,833 --> 01:47:02,130
With the rear wheels removed you've gained
elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.

911
01:47:02,213 --> 01:47:07,510
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.

912
01:47:07,594 --> 01:47:12,390
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.

913
01:47:12,473 --> 01:47:20,815
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

914
01:47:21,774 --> 01:47:23,818
Captain Howard and the marines

915
01:47:23,902 --> 01:47:28,198
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun
and musket fire from the tops.

916
01:47:28,281 --> 01:47:31,326
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.

917
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:36,664
They mean to take us as a prize.

918
01:47:36,748 --> 01:47:43,463
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed will be their downfall.

919
01:47:45,298 --> 01:47:48,134
England is under threat of invasion.

920
01:47:48,218 --> 01:47:52,388
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.

921
01:47:54,015 --> 01:47:56,893
This ship is England.

922
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:04,567
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

923
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:08,071
After all, surprise is on our side.

924
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:22,460
- Toss them high so they can see them.
- Hello, Doctor.

925
01:48:22,544 --> 01:48:23,920
Jack.

926
01:48:24,003 --> 01:48:26,256
- Care for a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

927
01:48:26,339 --> 01:48:28,925
If you please, Doctor.

928
01:48:30,343 --> 01:48:33,596
- I took the liberty, Doctor.
- Thank you, Killick.

929
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:38,351
- There's three lumps in there.
- How kind.

930
01:49:33,114 --> 01:49:35,617
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Peter.

931
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:40,955
- See you afterwards.
- And you.

932
01:49:41,998 --> 01:49:45,627
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

933
01:49:48,087 --> 01:49:51,674
English whaler <i>Syren,</i> this is <i>Acheron.</i>

934
01:49:51,758 --> 01:49:53,426
- Barret.
- Sir.

935
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:58,306
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.

936
01:49:58,389 --> 01:50:01,851
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

937
01:50:01,935 --> 01:50:05,355
English whaler, this is your last warning.

938
01:50:05,438 --> 01:50:09,734
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

939
01:50:09,817 --> 01:50:12,070
Let fly!

940
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:17,825
Haul your yards there.

941
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,329
Run out, boys.

942
01:50:21,412 --> 01:50:22,580
Fire!

943
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:25,583
Fire!

944
01:50:34,467 --> 01:50:37,136
For the mainmast, lads.

945
01:50:44,102 --> 01:50:46,563
- Let me through.
- Fire!

946
01:51:14,174 --> 01:51:16,259
Hard a-larboard.

947
01:51:16,968 --> 01:51:19,512
Right the headsails. Set the topsails.

948
01:51:19,596 --> 01:51:20,889
Heave.

949
01:51:21,973 --> 01:51:24,851
Man the starboard battery.

950
01:51:30,982 --> 01:51:33,359
Fire as she bears.

951
01:51:53,838 --> 01:51:56,799
Get to it.

952
01:51:56,883 --> 01:51:59,511
It's the fallen mast. We can't lay alongside.

953
01:51:59,594 --> 01:52:02,639
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I'll draw their fire.

954
01:52:02,722 --> 01:52:06,684
- My division to join Mr Pullings.
- Clew up topsails.

955
01:52:06,768 --> 01:52:09,771
Huzzah for Lucky Jack.

956
01:52:09,854 --> 01:52:12,482
Grappling hooks away.

957
01:52:12,565 --> 01:52:14,984
Run out the boarding planks.

958
01:52:17,111 --> 01:52:22,283
- My division, follow me.
- For England, for home, and for the prize.

959
01:52:22,909 --> 01:52:25,495
Here we go, lads.

960
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:31,751
Pipe down. Silence.

961
01:52:54,524 --> 01:52:56,526
Looks like the job is done, sir.

962
01:52:56,609 --> 01:52:58,361
<i>Acheron.</i>

963
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:13,877
Fire!

964
01:53:30,602 --> 01:53:32,979
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder.

965
01:53:33,062 --> 01:53:34,939
That's it.

966
01:53:35,023 --> 01:53:36,107
Fire!

967
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,694
Keep moving, men. Keep moving.

968
01:54:28,827 --> 01:54:30,703
Joe.

969
01:54:36,584 --> 01:54:38,211
Grenades, ready.

970
01:54:48,388 --> 01:54:51,349
They're aiming for our hull.

971
01:54:51,432 --> 01:54:54,102
They could sink us. Depress the muzzle.

972
01:54:54,185 --> 01:54:56,229
Padeen, train it aft.

973
01:54:56,312 --> 01:54:57,981
Together now.

974
01:54:58,898 --> 01:55:01,025
Stand clear.

975
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:02,902
Fire!

976
01:55:03,778 --> 01:55:06,197
Arm yourselves. We must board them.

977
01:55:07,574 --> 01:55:09,659
Follow me.

978
01:55:25,091 --> 01:55:26,843
Now.

979
01:55:31,514 --> 01:55:35,643
Whalers, follow me.
Mr Hogg, down below. Quickly now.

980
01:55:38,104 --> 01:55:41,900
Albatrosses. Albatrosses, do you hear me?

981
01:55:42,859 --> 01:55:44,903
To the guns.

982
01:55:48,489 --> 01:55:50,825
Boyle, douse that gun's priming.

983
01:56:26,027 --> 01:56:29,030
Lively there. Come on. Move.

984
01:56:32,575 --> 01:56:35,245
Now do your worst.

985
01:57:06,609 --> 01:57:08,570
- Mr Howard.
- Sir.

986
01:57:08,653 --> 01:57:11,281
- Have they struck their colours?
- I believe so.

987
01:57:11,364 --> 01:57:15,034
- Has their captain been sighted?
- Not yet, sir.

988
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:16,995
- Carry on.
- Aye, sir.

989
01:58:18,973 --> 01:58:21,392
<i>Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.</i>

990
01:58:21,476 --> 01:58:24,270
I did what I could for him.

991
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:33,488
Before the <i>capitaine</i> died,
he said I was to give you this.

992
02:00:03,495 --> 02:00:06,456
No. I'll do it.

993
02:00:20,178 --> 02:00:22,597
Can you help me?

994
02:00:46,454 --> 02:00:48,289
Our Father,

995
02:00:48,373 --> 02:00:52,418
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

996
02:00:52,502 --> 02:00:56,381
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

997
02:00:56,464 --> 02:00:58,842
on earth as it is in heaven.

998
02:00:59,509 --> 02:01:02,262
Give us this day our daily bread,

999
02:01:02,345 --> 02:01:07,267
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1000
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:11,437
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1001
02:01:11,521 --> 02:01:13,481
For thine is the kingdom,

1002
02:01:13,565 --> 02:01:15,608
the power and the glory,

1003
02:01:15,692 --> 02:01:17,777
forever and ever.

1004
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:19,404
Amen.

1005
02:01:20,029 --> 02:01:23,491
Robert Gardner, able seaman.

1006
02:01:23,575 --> 02:01:27,412
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.

1007
02:01:27,495 --> 02:01:30,540
Robert Kemp, able seaman.

1008
02:01:31,749 --> 02:01:35,670
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.

1009
02:01:36,921 --> 02:01:40,884
Michael Doudle, able seaman.

1010
02:01:42,385 --> 02:01:46,055
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.

1011
02:01:47,682 --> 02:01:50,935
John Allen, sailing master.

1012
02:01:56,441 --> 02:01:58,443
Peter Miles Calamy,

1013
02:02:03,156 --> 02:02:05,408
lieutenant.

1014
02:02:07,827 --> 02:02:11,080
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,

1015
02:02:11,164 --> 02:02:13,333
to be turned into corruption,

1016
02:02:13,416 --> 02:02:17,253
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,

1017
02:02:17,337 --> 02:02:20,215
and the life of the world to come,

1018
02:02:20,298 --> 02:02:23,635
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1019
02:02:23,718 --> 02:02:25,803
Amen.

1020
02:02:54,666 --> 02:02:56,960
It's our old friend.

1021
02:03:51,347 --> 02:03:54,350
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

1022
02:04:00,857 --> 02:04:05,028
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.

1023
02:04:05,111 --> 02:04:06,738
Good.

1024
02:04:06,821 --> 02:04:09,616
I think I shall return to the Galápagos.

1025
02:04:09,699 --> 02:04:13,453
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.

1026
02:04:13,536 --> 02:04:14,746
Very good, sir.

1027
02:04:14,829 --> 02:04:18,291
You, however,
shall take the <i>Acheron</i> south to Valparaíso.

1028
02:04:18,374 --> 02:04:23,588
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

1029
02:04:23,671 --> 02:04:26,716
I believe Mr Hogg
would be a good choice for sailing master.

1030
02:04:26,799 --> 02:04:31,554
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.

1031
02:04:36,476 --> 02:04:38,561
Your orders.

1032
02:04:42,357 --> 02:04:45,109
- Thank you, sir.
- Godspeed, Tom.

1033
02:04:45,193 --> 02:04:47,195
And to you, sir.

1034
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:54,911
- Mr Mowett?
- With pleasure, sir.

1035
02:04:54,994 --> 02:04:57,664
- Good luck.
- See you in Portsmouth.

1036
02:04:57,747 --> 02:05:01,251
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings.

1037
02:05:08,883 --> 02:05:12,637
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, Captain.

1038
02:05:28,653 --> 02:05:30,572
Here we go again.

1039
02:05:30,655 --> 02:05:33,116
Killick. Killick there.

1040
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:35,994
Which it will be ready when it's ready.

1041
02:05:41,541 --> 02:05:44,460
I'll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.

1042
02:05:44,544 --> 02:05:49,841
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

1043
02:05:49,924 --> 02:05:53,595
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

1044
02:05:53,678 --> 02:05:58,474
- I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
- No, he died of fever months ago.

1045
02:05:58,558 --> 02:06:01,144
De Vigny?

1046
02:06:12,655 --> 02:06:16,451
- Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
- Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

1047
02:06:16,534 --> 02:06:19,579
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

1048
02:06:20,538 --> 02:06:21,748
Sir.

1049
02:06:21,831 --> 02:06:24,876
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.

1050
02:06:24,959 --> 02:06:28,463
We'll intercept the <i>Acheron</i>
and escort them into Valparaíso.

1051
02:06:28,546 --> 02:06:31,424
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.

1052
02:06:32,467 --> 02:06:35,220
- And William.
- Sir?

1053
02:06:35,303 --> 02:06:38,056
- Beat to quarters.
- Very good, sir.

1054
02:06:43,102 --> 02:06:46,564
Subject to the requirements of the service.

1055
02:06:53,988 --> 02:06:57,325
Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?

1056
02:06:57,408 --> 02:06:58,493
Yes.

1057
02:06:59,577 --> 02:07:02,247
It's not going anywhere.

1058
02:17:25,328 --> 02:17:28,748
