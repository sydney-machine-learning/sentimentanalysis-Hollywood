1
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,661
They called it the car for Everyman.

2
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:35,197
Henry Ford himself called it
a car for the "great multitude."

3
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:42,106
It was functional and simple,
like your sewing machine
or your cast-iron stove.

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,979
You could learn to drive it
in less than a day,

5
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:52,753
and you could get any color
you wanted, so long as it was black.

6
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:59,796
When Ford first conceived the Model T,
it took 13 hours to assemble.

7
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:06,068
Within five years, he was
turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds.

8
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:14,504
Of course, the real invention wasn't the car,
it was the assembly line that built it.

9
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:20,476
Pretty soon, other businesses
had borrowed the same techniques.

10
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:23,681
Seamstresses became button sewers.

11
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:27,624
Furniture makers
became knob turners.

12
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:31,596
It was the beginning and the end
of imagination...

13
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:34,098
all at the same time.

14
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:48,914
Howard?

15
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:52,845
- Charles, I'm talking to you.
- Hmm?

16
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,379
They need spokes,
same as the others.
They oughta make a better spoke.

17
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,085
Yeah? Then what
would you do?

18
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:30,482
It was a land of opportunity.

19
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,214
The country was shrinking,
and there was life
to be made out West...

20
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,883
for any man with drive
and ambition.

21
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:43,088
If your dream was big enough
and you had the guts to follow it,

22
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:46,996
there was truly a fortune
to be made.

23
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:58,372
How are you, sir?

24
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,591
Damn thing blew on me.
What?

25
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,652
It's a Stanley Steamer.
The boiler blew.

26
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,722
- Oh?
- Can you fix it?

27
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,166
Uh...

28
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:03,573
Sure. Sure, I can fix it.

29
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,477
This is an amazing machine.

30
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,946
It's got a two-stroke boiler system...

31
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:45,984
that's heated
by this huge fire grate.

32
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:50,751
I mean, it's...
Well, it's basically
a very small locomotive.

33
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:53,485
Thank you.
Now, I made
some improvements.

34
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,392
It wasn't your boiler that was blowing;
it was your bleed valve.

35
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:59,954
So, with increased pressure,
I can see you getting
up to 40 miles an hour.

36
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:04,799
Really?
Oh, yeah. And if you superheat the excess,
I can see you reaching...

37
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,304
Fifty, maybe 60 miles an hour.
Is that right?

38
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:12,106
Easily. And the thing
of it is, Mr. Coughlin,
you don't feed it,

39
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:17,343
you don't stable it, and unless
you hit a lamppost, the thing's not
gonna get sick and die on ya.

40
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:21,352
- That's funny.
- To tell you the truth,

41
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,720
I wouldn't spend more than five dollars
on the best horse in America.

42
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:11,900
This is not the finish line, my friends.
This is the start of the race.

43
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:16,806
The future is the finish line!
And the new Buick White Streak
is just the car to take us there!

44
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:21,313
Four in-line cylinders,
42 1/2 horsepower,

45
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,148
- Wonderful.
- This is the same car you can buy at any
of our five showrooms across the Bay Area.

46
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:32,486
- "The age of the automobile is here,"
boasted Howard. "The future has arrived."

47
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,426
Oh, my.
Read the part about
the future again.

48
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:44,299
- Oh, I'm kind of
dealing with it right now.
- Oh, sorry. Here. I'll take him.

49
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,430
Come here, big guy.
Come here. Come here.

50
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:51,067
Oh, are you the future, huh?
Are you the future?

51
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:54,442
Are you gonna...

52
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,449
Are you going to the moon?

53
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:00,508
The moon! Whee!

54
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:05,119
- I'll take it.

55
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:09,025
Do we really
need all this?
No. No. We don't need it...

56
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:14,089
There's also a caretaker's house,
a paddock, a barn,
some very nice stables.

57
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,157
How big are the stables?

58
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:52,570
- Got it.

59
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:55,232
- Settle down. Settle down.

60
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:58,674
Quit. Quit. Whoa. Whoa.

61
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:02,510
- Whoa.

62
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,812
Whoa.

63
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,738
Come on, Dad.

64
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:38,507
Whoa.

65
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,260
There you go.

66
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:02,603
You're not getting him a horse.

67
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,576
Why not?
He's great at it.

68
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:09,546
Because he's 16 years old.
- So?

69
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:12,413
So... he should earn it.

70
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:18,753
All right.

71
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:22,419
- All... All right. Quiet.
- Everybody knows it.

72
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,962
Nobody knows Longfellow.
Dickinson.

73
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,555
Ooh!

74
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:32,398
"We never know how high we are..."

75
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,271
Oh, I know that.
Yeah. I know.

76
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:38,833
I know it.
Well?

77
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:45,943
"We never know
how high we are
till we are called to rise."

78
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,486
- Good.
- Very good, John.

79
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:51,580
"And then, if we are true to plan,
our statures touch the skies."

80
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:55,457
- Excellent.
- Yes.!
- That's really good.

81
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:02,128
Uh-oh.

82
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:06,169
- "The heroism..."
- Right.

83
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,798
Right. "The heroism..."

84
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:12,002
"The heroism we recite...

85
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:14,841
"would be a daily thing,

86
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:20,045
That's it.
"Did not ourselves
the cubits warp,

87
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,146
for fear to be a king. "

88
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:33,191
You should be riding it.
You knew the poem.

89
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:38,897
Yeah. But he
looks so perfect out there,
doesn't he?

90
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:42,304
Yeah. He does.

91
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:45,810
That's the poetry
right there, Agnes.

92
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:48,244
That's the poetry.

93
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:53,184
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

94
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:56,187
I came here 15 years ago
with 21 cents in my pocket.

95
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:59,156
I know a lot of us at the table
have a story like that.

96
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:02,352
And, you know,
I can't help thinking...

97
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:07,866
that if we can start out there
and end up here, where can't we go
in America?

98
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:13,701
Hmm? So, as corny as it sounds,
I'd like to propose a toast
to the future.

99
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:19,142
Because out here, my friends,
the sky is literally the limit.

100
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,202
To the future!
To the future!

101
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,216
To the future.!

102
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:50,738
There were no suicides
on Wall Street that day.

103
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,643
It was a myth
that would grow over time.

104
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:02,381
The real effect of October 29
took a little longer to sink in.

105
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:10,326
By noon, all the gains
of the previous year
had been obliterated.

106
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:15,993
By 4:00 p.m., nearly $ 10 billion
of market value was gone.

107
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:23,268
Over the next two weeks,
the hemorrhage continued.

108
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:30,443
And before long,
25% of the workforce was unemployed.

109
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:39,586
A great national migration began.

110
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:43,287
Displaced families
took to the American highway...

111
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:46,729
in the last possession
that remained to them:

112
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,768
Their automobile.

113
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:55,232
And all at once,
millions of Americans...

114
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:59,107
had a new definition of home.

115
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:27,528
I made two dollars today.

116
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:32,134
- What?
- I made two dollars.

117
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,009
Here.

118
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:42,086
Where did you get these?

119
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:49,052
Yeah, your boy combed 'em out,
changed all the tack. I didn't have
to tell him a thing.

120
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,863
- Hey, Red,
-
Attaboy!

121
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,926
Where'd a young fella
like you learn so much about horses?

122
00:15:59,004 --> 00:16:02,235
His name's Johnny.

123
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:04,366
You can call me Red.

124
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,442
Whoo!

125
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:19,522
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

126
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:57,828
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

127
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:07,797
What's that?
Everything.

128
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,501
Dickens, Wordsworth.

129
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:15,775
There's your Arabian Nights
and Moby Dick, even your Milne,
from when you were...

130
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:19,339
Why? What's wrong?

131
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:23,548
Mr. Blodget here,
he has a house, a real house.
Dad... Dad, what's wrong?

132
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,749
- And his wife cooks.
- She is a good cook.

133
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:29,453
No. No. Shh. Dad. Shh.
There's even a phone next door.
We'll call you.

134
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,156
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you,
and we'll tell you where we are.
No. No.

135
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,496
We're just gonna go home,
all right? Let's go.
Listen to me.

136
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:39,799
You have a gift.
You have a gift.

137
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:44,240
Don't... Don't do this.

138
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,301
Dad, don't do this.
We'll be back.

139
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,885
Go on. Go with Mr. Blodget.
No.

140
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,656
He's gonna take care of you, sweetie.
Go with him.
Mom, don't do this.

141
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:33,221
I don't know. You still
look pretty tall to be a jockey.

142
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,057
I've never been over 115.

143
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,189
Where'd you learn
to ride like that?
Home.

144
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,761
All right.
Here's the way it works.

145
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:48,397
I pay you $10 a week to ride.
You owe nine dollars for your meals,

146
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:51,465
six dollars to sleep in the stalls,
three dollar tack fee.

147
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:54,774
That's the deal.
How do I pay all that back?

148
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,007
You win.

149
00:18:57,082 --> 00:19:00,108
Ow.!

150
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:07,017
You son of a bitch.!
Get off of me.!

151
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,172
Yah!

152
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,585
Get lost!

153
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:54,138
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

154
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,980
Get off of me!

155
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:15,659
A nose?
You lose a race a nose,
you'd better fall off tryin.!

156
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:21,097
Here. Muck these stalls down,
every damn one of'em!

157
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,158
A nose!
For Christ's sake!

158
00:20:30,842 --> 00:20:34,175
No. No, Bill.
I'm not gonna do it.
No more layoffs.

159
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,215
Well, it can't
get any worse.

160
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:41,378
Look, if it stays like this,
we'll just...

161
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:46,413
Bill, we'll be fine, really.
We will.

162
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:50,791
All right. I'll see you in town.

163
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:01,534
Frankie, come on.
It's a glorious day outside.

164
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:05,372
- Why don't... Why don't you
go fishing or something?
- I'm reading.

165
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:10,211
You can read when it's raining.
Come on. I'll teach you to drive the truck.

166
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:13,809
You already taught me
to drive the truck.

167
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:16,877
- Well, what are you reading?
- Flash Gordon.

168
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:22,018
-
- Come on, Dad. It's about the future!

169
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,692
We'll be in San Francisco
till Wednesday.

170
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:54,477
Yeah? What?

171
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:11,822
Come inside.
- I'm not done.

172
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,381
Sam can do that.

173
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:19,522
I don't want Sam to do it.
I want to do it.

174
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:24,399
- Annie.
- Don... Don... No!

175
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:34,038
Ma'am.

176
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,826
Come on, Red!
Come on!

177
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,547
At a time when the world
really needed a drink,

178
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,750
you couldn't get one
in the United States of America.

179
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:30,226
Liquor was illegal.
Diversions were scarce,

180
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:34,197
and there's just so much
a human being can do without.

181
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,500
Soon, the border town was born,

182
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:44,008
providing everything to the south
that their neighbor to the north
would not.

183
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:49,672
You could find anything:
Food, companionship,

184
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:55,185
decent gin,
and with gambling outlawed as well,

185
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:59,553
- the chance
to turn bad luck into good.
-

186
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:07,662
Relax! You got it!
You got it! You got it!

187
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:10,394
Go!

188
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:14,097
That jockey was ridin'
like he's got an anvil in his pocket.

189
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:18,268
I'm gonna bet
with you no more.
I no like it.

190
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,242
Who's that?

191
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:28,285
George Woolf,
greatest jockey in the world.

192
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:43,789
That's Charles Howard?
Yeah.

193
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:46,928
I thought
he came down here for a...
Quickie divorce?

194
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:51,533
- Why?
Look at him.

195
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:55,439
Nothing quick about that.

196
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,162
It was in the palace
of the great sultan.

197
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:24,174
Sultan of where?
The Sultan of Araby.

198
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:29,339
I'd been living there
for almost a year, racing his Arabians
across the desert by day...

199
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:33,009
and finishing my personal history
of the region by night.

200
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:38,852
Then one day, the sultan
summons me into his throne room.

201
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:41,949
He looks at me and says,

202
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:46,087
- "John Pollard..."
- "John Pollard,
you are my greatest jockey.

203
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:51,932
It is you I have chosen
to ride my hundred-mile race
from Kusmat to Tripoli."

204
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:55,905
200-mile.

205
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,841
All right. 200-mile.
Excuse me, sahib.

206
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:06,413
- You didn't need to wreck it, Georgie.
- When you started tellin' that story,
it was only 50 miles.

207
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:10,079
Yeah, well,
everything gets longer
in the retellin'.

208
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:13,612
Just ask your friend Wanda
over there.

209
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:17,491
You know, if you start ridin'
a little more and talkin' a little less,
you might start winnin' some races.

210
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:20,463
- I got two bucks says
I beat you in this one.
- I'm not sure if you do,

211
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:23,056
but I got five says I beat you.
Done.

212
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:31,041
- Give me odds.
You're the favorite.
- Even money.

213
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:34,272
- Nah! Forget it! Two-to-one!
- Fine.

214
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:38,304
You got it. Hey, Johnny.
You're on a speed horse. What
are you doin' back here with me?

215
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:41,716
I like the conversation,
and it's not a speed horse.
Don't try to hook me.

216
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:43,947
You goin' tonight?
Nah. You?

217
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:46,422
Nah.
What time?

218
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,151
I don't know. 8:00?
Okeydoke.

219
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:53,629
Oops. There's my hole!
Gotta go! Yah!

220
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,939
Goddamn it!

221
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,643
- Whoa!

222
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,948
- We got him.!

223
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,480
- I'll take him.
- Get the hell out of here.

224
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,961
- I said, I'll take him.
- He's got a fractured foot.

225
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:27,827
If you're gonna shoot him anyway,
I'll save you the bullet.

226
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:34,504
- Whoa.
- Fine.

227
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:38,167
Let him go. Hey.
Let him have him.
Mira.

228
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,489
Now, bud.

229
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,564
Yeah, boy.

230
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:48,709
Okeydoke, Johnny.
There's the hole.! Gotta fly.!

231
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:57,079
Yeah.! Yeah.! Yeah.! Yeah.!

232
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,627
There once was a princess
from Siam...

233
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:09,427
who was sitting here
sort of like I am.

234
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,200
I wined her and dined her,
and then I reclined her.

235
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:23,905
Ah, shit.
What rhymes with Siam?

236
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:26,882
That's great.
You make that up?

237
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:30,717
Pretty obvious, huh?

238
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:36,055
- That's beautiful.
- No. You're beautiful.

239
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:39,221
Don't say that.
You pay me.

240
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:47,094
So, you wanna... you know...

241
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,435
get going?

242
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,835
Sure. Why not?

243
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:15,692
- How do you miss a hole like that?
- There's my hole! Gotta fly!

244
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,791
Are you blind?

245
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:27,570
ngel, are you okay?

246
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:32,877
Ol!

247
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,148
Ol!

248
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,505
You don't wanna watch?

249
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,652
No. Not really.

250
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:14,254
I don't either.

251
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:18,820
Ol!

252
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,061
So, what? They brought you
down here to make you feel better?
Is that it?

253
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:31,408
Yes. Sort of.

254
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:34,603
Those guys, they think
everything is fixed with a party.

255
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:40,208
I'm sorry. Who are you?

256
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:44,345
Oh. Marcela Zabala.

257
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:51,923
My sister, Isabella,
she's married...
No. No, no. I know.

258
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:55,932
Nice to meet you. Charles.
Mucho gusto.

259
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:12,146
So, do you feel better?

260
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:21,658
No. No, not really.

261
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,657
No. How could you?

262
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:29,598
With something like that.

263
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:06,593
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

264
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,332
Come on.

265
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:22,812
- Did I lose?
- Oh, no. You clobbered him.

266
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,992
Easy.

267
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:31,687
Easy, easy.
Nice and slow.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

268
00:37:31,762 --> 00:37:33,753
Come on. Let me
buy you some turtle soup.
I'm fine, George.

269
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:37,824
Go win yourself a race or something.
Let's go down to Sloan's,
and we'll just...

270
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:42,464
I'm fine, George.
I don't need your help, and I sure
as shit don't need your charity.

271
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:48,074
Leave me alone,
all right?

272
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,678
It's been 20 years
since I've been on a horse.
Don't worry.

273
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:00,986
It's the kind of thing
that comes right back.

274
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:23,375
Let's go.

275
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:34,055
Come on!

276
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:18,060
What? She got you back up on a horse,
and now you wanna buy 'em?

277
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:22,572
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe a couple.
You wanna win or just own 'em?

278
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,666
I wanna win.
What sort of question is that?

279
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,576
Well, you're gonna
need a trainer before
you buy horses.

280
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:31,740
No. You need two.
So you can fire one, eh?

281
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,256
Randy Thatcher's barn.
Trains about 50 or 60 ponies.

282
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:45,557
Good fella too.
Real horse person.
A real horse-shitter. Scusa.

283
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:48,996
Now, now. I don't know.
Maybe you want a smaller barn,
somebody who can take the time to...

284
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:53,093
Who's that?
- Huh?

285
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,834
Oh, he's a crackpot.
Lives alone in the bushes.

286
00:39:57,908 --> 00:40:00,604
What's he do?

287
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:06,378
I don't know. He used
to be a trainer, farrier. Now he just
looks after that horse.

288
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,016
Come on.
Let's look at another barn.

289
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:31,602
- Howdy.
- Hello.

290
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:40,043
Wh... You hungry?
No. No, thanks.

291
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:43,109
I'm fine.
Charles Howard.

292
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:46,350
Tom... Smith.
Nice to meet you, Tom.

293
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,754
What's... What's in his bandage?

294
00:40:54,665 --> 00:41:00,103
Oh, that's hawthorn root.
It increases circulation.

295
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,970
You wanna sit down?

296
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,033
Oh. All right.
Thank you.

297
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:14,206
Will he get better?

298
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:17,344
Already is... a little.

299
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:21,858
Will he race?

300
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:25,656
No. Not that one.

301
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:30,391
So why are you fixing him?

302
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,560
'Cause I can.

303
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:39,868
Every horse
is good for somethin'.

304
00:41:39,943 --> 00:41:43,970
He could be a cart horse
or a lead pony.

305
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:47,108
And he's still nice to look at.

306
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:51,644
You know, you don't
throw a whole life away...

307
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:54,316
just 'cause
he's banged up a little.

308
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:11,007
Is that coffee?

309
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:13,066
Yeah.

310
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:21,280
It's bad, though.

311
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:24,020
You always tell the truth?

312
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:27,148
Well, I try to.

313
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:46,675
It ain't just the speed.
It's the heart.

314
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:50,771
You want something
that's not afraid to compete.

315
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:54,545
Half these horses
are just show ponies.

316
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:58,019
You want something
that's not gonna run from a fight.

317
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:02,952
How do you find that?

318
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:06,621
Look, I won the Robles Handicap.
I was second in the Tijuana Derby.

319
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:09,791
I won the Manzanita Oaks.
You know, that used to be a stakes race.

320
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:13,530
I know.
I would've won T.J.,
but the piece of shit lugged out on me.

321
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:18,974
- Sounds great. We'll let ya know.
- Look. I can work 'em out in the morning.

322
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:24,344
Or even hot-walk 'em
if you need me to.

323
00:43:24,414 --> 00:43:28,077
Really? You'll hot-walk 'em?

324
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:31,417
This is somethin' else.

325
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:33,888
A dream come true,
walkin' you around.

326
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:38,519
Hook you up to a plow,
pull me around for a little while.
Come on.

327
00:43:38,595 --> 00:43:42,725
You ever run in the money?
Huh?

328
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,769
Hey. Hey.
You ever run in the money?

329
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:49,772
I don't think so. Couldn't beat
a human being, let alone another horse.

330
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,743
You goddamn sack-of-crap
old plater.

331
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:59,306
Probably the fastest
you're gonna run in your entire life,
you piece-of-shit old glue-pot.

332
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:03,342
- That's right.

333
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:26,036
The first time
he saw Seabiscuit, the colt was walking
through the fog at 5:00 in the morning.

334
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:31,572
Smith would say later that the horse
looked right through him...

335
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:34,913
as if to say,
"What the hell are you looking at?

336
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:39,820
- Who do you think you are?"

337
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,654
He was a small horse,
barely 15 hands.

338
00:44:42,726 --> 00:44:47,493
He was hurting too.
There was a limp in his walk,

339
00:44:47,564 --> 00:44:51,091
a wheezing when he breathed.

340
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:53,728
Smith didn't pay attention
to that.

341
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:58,468
He was looking the horse
in the eye.

342
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:02,342
God... damn.

343
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:13,114
He was the son of Hard Tack,
sired by the mighty Man O' War.

344
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,956
But the breeding did little
to impress anyone at Claiborne Farms.

345
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:19,928
Get rid of him.

346
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:28,968
At six months,
he was shipped off to train with
the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons,

347
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,770
who, over time,
developed a similar opinion of the colt.

348
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:36,609
Is that a racehorse
or a lead pony?

349
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:41,045
The judgment wasn't helped
by his gentle nature.

350
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:45,851
Where his sire had been a fierce,
almost violent competitor,

351
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:48,892
Seabiscuit took to sleeping
for huge chunks of the day...

352
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:54,158
and enjoyed lolling for hours
under the boughs of the juniper trees.

353
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:57,792
His other great talent was eating.

354
00:45:57,868 --> 00:46:03,238
Though half the size of other colts,
Seabiscuit could frequently
eat twice as much.

355
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:07,567
Fitzsimmons decided
the horse was lazy...

356
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:11,239
and felt sure he could train
the obstinance out of him.

357
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:15,752
I want you to hit him
as many times as you can
over a quarter of a mile.

358
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:20,188
When he didn't improve,
they decided the colt
was incorrigible.

359
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,616
They made him a training partner
to better horses,

360
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:27,186
forcing him to lose
head-to-head duels...

361
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:29,630
to boost the confidence
of the other animal.

362
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:32,868
By the time
he was three years old,

363
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:36,394
Seabiscuit was struggling
in two cheap claiming races a week.

364
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:42,175
Soon he grew as bitter and angry
as his sire Hard Tack had been.

365
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:48,084
He was sold
for the rock-bottom price
of $2,000.

366
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:54,752
And, of course,
it all made sense.

367
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:58,625
Champions were large,
they were sleek,

368
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:00,686
they were without imperfection.

369
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:06,124
When they finally did race him,
he did just what
they had trained him to do.

370
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,137
He lost.

371
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,508
What exactly
is it you like?

372
00:47:12,576 --> 00:47:15,602
He's got spirit.

373
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,239
I'll say.

374
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:23,110
Can... Can he be ridden?
Oh, sure.

375
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:29,716
Eventually.

376
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:33,729
He can be
a little touchy.
Yeah, I got it.

377
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:36,425
No. Really.

378
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,491
I'm fine.

379
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:49,712
Jesus Christ!
That horse is nuts!

380
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:11,100
Come on.!
Come on.! Come on.!

381
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:13,136
Let's go.! Come on,
you sons of bitches.!

382
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,074
Let's go.!
Come on.!

383
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:31,186
Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!

384
00:48:31,254 --> 00:48:33,984
I'll take all of you!
Come on! Come on!

385
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:01,216
It's okay.

386
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:06,047
- I'm not afraid of you.

387
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:09,115
Sure. I know.

388
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,754
I know what
you're all about.

389
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,105
You hungry?

390
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:27,466
Huh?

391
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,677
Yeah. Bet you are.

392
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,413
Huh? Come on.

393
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:39,478
Come on, boy.

394
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:51,256
Yeah.

395
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:58,466
Why don't you just
breeze him around
one turn.

396
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:01,204
Give the folks a look.
Right.

397
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:06,138
Red Pollard,
Mr. And Mrs. Howard.
Yeah. Hi.

398
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:09,652
Hello.

399
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,653
Well, we'll just
be movin' on.

400
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,688
Does he breeze?

401
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:22,163
Well, we'll find out.

402
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:43,511
Seems pretty fast.
Yeah.

403
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:45,612
In every direction.

404
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:50,220
Hell, he's so beat up,
it's hard to tell what he's like.

405
00:50:51,394 --> 00:50:53,692
I just can't help feelin'
they got him...

406
00:50:53,763 --> 00:50:56,323
so screwed up
runnin'in a circle,

407
00:50:56,399 --> 00:51:00,358
he's forgotten
what he was born to do.

408
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,734
He just needs to learn
how to be a horse again.

409
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:08,969
Well, how do
you do that?

410
00:51:16,419 --> 00:51:20,879
How far do you
want me to take him?
Till he stops.

411
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:24,953
Okay.

412
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,019
That seems like
a pretty good ride.

413
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:31,533
Hope so.

414
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,053
That's it, boy.

415
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:53,055
You're all right.

416
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:55,717
Let's see what you got, boy.
Ha! Ha!

417
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:59,250
Ha! Ha! Whoo!

418
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:02,196
That's it, boy. That's it!

419
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,398
Yeah!

420
00:52:17,113 --> 00:52:19,411
Whoo!

421
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:25,010
Whoo-hoo!

422
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:37,390
Well, at least
he wasn't expensive.
No. That's true.

423
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,837
Whoo!

424
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:51,245
Goddamn it!
You're an amazing animal!

425
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:58,851
Whoo!

426
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:20,165
You can
come inside, you know.

427
00:53:20,243 --> 00:53:23,440
I'm fine. Thank you.
Yeah,
you look it.

428
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:27,206
No, really, I'm fine.

429
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:31,219
Okay.
Suit yourself.

430
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,292
Welcome.

431
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,843
Thank you.
You're welcome.

432
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:15,187
It's okay.

433
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:18,200
Oh, I'm not that hungry.

434
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:20,896
Mmm. Sure you're not.

435
00:54:22,172 --> 00:54:24,106
It's just a lot of food.

436
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:31,904
It's okay.

437
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:34,347
Rather have you strong than thin.

438
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,168
They called it "relief,"

439
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:02,108
but it was
a lot more than that.

440
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:04,408
It had dozens of names:

441
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:06,972
N.R.A., W.P.A.,

442
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,484
the C.C.C.

443
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:12,316
But it really came down
to just one thing.

444
00:55:14,624 --> 00:55:17,092
For the first time
in a long time,

445
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,151
someone cared.

446
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:23,660
For the first time
in a long time,

447
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:26,224
you were no longer alone.

448
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,302
Goat racing?

449
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:17,312
Oh, no. Just trying
to calm him down a little.

450
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,247
Smart ones
hate being alone
all the time.

451
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:23,149
Oh.
And sometimes
another animal,

452
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:26,188
it just...
just soothes them a bit.

453
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:07,394
Pretty quiet in there.

454
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:10,057
What'd you do?

455
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,124
Go take a look.

456
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:23,605
Oh.

457
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,583
# Rock of ages, cleft for me #

458
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:33,645
# I am hid and safe in thee #

459
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:38,660
# For the water
and the blood #

460
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:40,795
# From thy riven...#

461
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:43,058
Okay. You don't
break him or anything,

462
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:46,158
but we gotta see
what he's got.

463
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:49,363
You take him
to the 5  pole...

464
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:51,771
and turn him loose.

465
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:54,935
Turn him loose?
Yeah, son.

466
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:57,002
He's a racehorse.

467
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,517
Ha! Ha!
Come on!

468
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,052
Come on!

469
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:16,189
Ha! Come on!
I know you got more than this!
Let's show 'em, boy!

470
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,004
How's he look?

471
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:25,199
Asleep.

472
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:30,243
Come on!
Let's show 'em, Pops!
Come on!

473
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:43,583
Whoo! There it is! Yeah!
Whoo!

474
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:45,820
Oh, my.

475
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,836
Yeah, you and me! Let's go!

476
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:01,604
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

477
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:15,155
- Boy. Fast?
- Oh. Yeah.

478
01:00:15,224 --> 01:00:17,215
How fast?

479
01:00:18,528 --> 01:00:21,986
Your horse just broke
the track record at Tanforan.

480
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:29,529
Sometimes they...
they just, uh,

481
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:31,539
hanker for a little competition.

482
01:00:38,714 --> 01:00:42,343
As long as we're talkin' long shots,
I got a real doozy for you, folks.

483
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:45,012
We got a horse
that's going off at 70-to-1,

484
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:47,055
and that's a short price, my friends.

485
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:50,149
This horse couldn't win
a church raffle, let alone
a $2,000 allowance.

486
01:00:50,226 --> 01:00:52,490
Yeah, talk about
a jump in class.

487
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:54,530
This is the skunk
of the garden party.

488
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:56,531
Yes, he's the surprise
in the punch bowl.

489
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,626
As a matter of fact, I'll lay
even money that this nag, Seabiscuit,
couldn't even finish six furlongs.

490
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:04,036
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin
live at Clockers' Corner.

491
01:01:07,643 --> 01:01:10,476
Wow.
I wanted maroon.
They only had bright red.

492
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:13,743
Oh, it looks great.
You don't think
the "H" is too big?

493
01:01:13,816 --> 01:01:16,148
You seen the size
of our jockey?

494
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:19,518
- Come on.

495
01:01:28,497 --> 01:01:32,695
Okay. Favorite's
that gray over there.

496
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:34,759
He's got a big late charge,

497
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:39,365
so lock in early with him
and stay right off his flank.

498
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:43,276
Okay.
Once our boy sees
who the competition is,

499
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:45,280
he'll do most of the work.

500
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:47,282
But don't move
till that gray does.

501
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,443
What if it's late?

502
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:52,043
- Let's go.

503
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:54,646
Twelve minutes to post.

504
01:01:54,724 --> 01:01:56,658
I don't think
it's gonna matter much.

505
01:01:56,726 --> 01:01:59,388
Honestly.

506
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:31,421
- Come on in.
Number 3, Pollard on Seabiscuit.

507
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:38,333
Hey, sahib.
Kinda small, isn't he?

508
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:41,029
Gonna look a lot smaller
in a second, Georgie.

509
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,900
I got five bucks
says he doesn't.

510
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:48,238
Starter's poised. The flag is up.

511
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:52,111
- And there they go.

512
01:02:52,181 --> 01:02:56,015
Pirate's Gold breaks first,
followed by Geronimo
on the outside.

513
01:02:56,085 --> 01:02:59,384
Silver Treasure is third,
followed by Seabiscuit.

514
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,932
They're coming by
the five-furlong pole.

515
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:18,099
It's Pirate's Gold, Geronimo,
Hill's Army and Agua Dulce.

516
01:03:22,778 --> 01:03:25,440
Whoa!

517
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:28,972
Son of a bitch!
Ha! Ha!

518
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:32,553
Piece of shit bastard!

519
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,325
What the hell is he doing?

520
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:40,226
...opening up a 3...
a 4-length lead...

521
01:03:40,296 --> 01:03:42,093
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

522
01:03:42,164 --> 01:03:45,224
I'm gonna put you on the rail,
you piece of shit!

523
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:49,265
- Get off of me!
- How do you like that,
you son of a bitch?

524
01:03:49,338 --> 01:03:52,307
You're gonna drop me, man!

525
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:56,311
The two horses are flying down...
- You like the rail?

526
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:08,081
- Here comes the cavalry charge.!
- Knock me off my horse!

527
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:12,089
It's Silver Treasure on the inside.

528
01:04:14,597 --> 01:04:17,259
Silver Treasure on the inside.
Silver Treasure and Pirate's Gold.

529
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:20,700
And at the wire
it's Silver Treasure.

530
01:04:25,841 --> 01:04:27,775
Aw, damn it.

531
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:29,936
What the hell
were you thinkin'?
He fouled me.

532
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:34,373
- What am I supposed to do,
let him get away with that?
- Well, yeah, when he's 40-to-1.

533
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,112
- He almost put me in the rail!
- Well, did he?

534
01:04:37,186 --> 01:04:39,484
Look, we had a plan.

535
01:04:39,555 --> 01:04:43,719
He fouled me, Tom!
What am I supposed to do?
He cut me off!

536
01:04:48,064 --> 01:04:50,259
He fouled me!

537
01:04:50,332 --> 01:04:52,994
Son? Son.

538
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:56,895
What are you so mad at?

539
01:05:08,317 --> 01:05:10,911
There's a phone next door.
We'll call you.

540
01:05:10,986 --> 01:05:13,648
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you
and tell you where we are.

541
01:05:13,722 --> 01:05:17,055
No. We're just gonna
go home. All right?

542
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:27,835
You have a gift.

543
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:30,371
You have a gift.

544
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:39,680
I need to borrow some money.

545
01:05:43,452 --> 01:05:45,920
All right.
I, uh,

546
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,548
I haven't been to a dentist,
and m...

547
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:53,192
Well, I-I need to borrow
some money.

548
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:56,959
- That's fine.
- I don't know when
I can pay you back.

549
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:01,069
I mean, when we win.
When we win, I can pay you back.

550
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:04,595
That is if you
still want me to ride.

551
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:08,936
Of course I want you to ride.

552
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:14,749
How much do you need?

553
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,751
Uh,

554
01:06:18,387 --> 01:06:20,378
ten dollars.

555
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:24,391
Here.

556
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,894
Than... Uh...
It's fine.

557
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,133
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

558
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:52,479
That's it, Pops.
We're okay now.
It's all right, boy.

559
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,358
Yeah, we're okay.

560
01:06:56,425 --> 01:06:58,655
Nothing to worry about.

561
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:01,821
All the time in the world, boy.
That's it, Pops.

562
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:04,661
Nice lead.
Just like that, boy.

563
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,257
Just like that.

564
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:13,004
What do you think, boy?
You ready to go?

565
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:16,272
You and me.
Let's go, boy. Let's go. Ha! Ha!

566
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:27,556
Ha.! Ha.!

567
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:59,179
Whoo!

568
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:03,888
In the end, it wasn't the dams...

569
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:07,292
or the roads
or the bridges or the parks.

570
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:11,660
Or the tunnels
or the thousands
of other public projects...

571
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,725
that were built
in those years.

572
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:17,064
It was more invisible
than that.

573
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:21,040
Men who were broken
only a year before...

574
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,101
suddenly felt restored.

575
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:27,546
Men who'd been shattered
suddenly found their voice.

576
01:08:27,616 --> 01:08:30,176
Well, I just think
this horse has a lot of heart.

577
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:32,447
He may have been down,
but he wasn't out.

578
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:35,581
He may have lost a few,
but he didn't
let it get to him.

579
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:38,058
We could all learn
a lick or two
from this little guy.

580
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:40,061
Oh, and by the way,
he doesn't know he's little.

581
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:42,256
He thinks he's
the biggest horse out there.

582
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:45,528
- So you got big plans
for this little horse?

583
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:47,865
Oh, yeah. See, sometimes
when the little guy,

584
01:08:47,936 --> 01:08:51,770
he doesn't know
he's a little guy,
he can do great big things.

585
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,967
- Can we get a shot here?

586
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:56,773
See, this isn't
the finish line.

587
01:08:56,845 --> 01:09:01,248
The future is the finish line,
and the Biscuit is just the horse
to get us there.

588
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:03,785
"Just the horse to get us there."

589
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:06,582
You certainly made a believer
out of me, Mr. Howard.

590
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:08,589
It's time for this old tout
to eat some crow.

591
01:09:08,657 --> 01:09:13,219
Four and 20 blackbirds,
to be exact, all baked up
in some humble pie,

592
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:15,388
and I'll take mine  la mode.

593
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:17,932
Oh.

594
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,093
And one more thing, Mr. Howard.
I just wanna say...

595
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:23,263
Thanks for the champagne.
Don't mention it.

596
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:25,398
Did you see the infield?
No, not yet.

597
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:28,807
Take a look.
Your little horse is sellin' out
the cheap seats.

598
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:41,195
Oh, my gosh.

599
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:44,494
Hey, what do you think
about all those folks
in the infield, Red?

600
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:47,400
That's who we're ridin' for,
folks with a quarter in their pocket.

601
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,404
Red! Red! Red!

602
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,963
That's an awful lot of hoopla
for such a little horse!

603
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:55,204
"Though he be but little,
he is fierce."

604
01:09:55,277 --> 01:09:57,404
What's that?
What?
That's Shakespeare, boys.

605
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,881
That's Shakespeare.
Oh, Shakespeare.

606
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:19,059
Holy cow!

607
01:10:22,304 --> 01:10:25,171
Look at that, Biscuit.
Look at that.

608
01:10:25,241 --> 01:10:27,766
There you go.
Oh, my God.

609
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:34,679
There he is!
Seabiscuit! Yea!

610
01:10:39,255 --> 01:10:41,348
That's for you, Pops.

611
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:43,414
That's for you.

612
01:11:17,093 --> 01:11:21,359
That makes six consecutive victories
for this little colt from nowhere,
one shy of the record.

613
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:24,627
Why, he may be
the biggest sensation on four legs
since Hope and Crosby.

614
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,659
Yes, it's standing room only
every time this pint-size pony
slips on a saddle,

615
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:32,367
and if you can't afford the quarter,
a comfy tree limb
will catch you a glimpse.

616
01:11:32,441 --> 01:11:34,966
So what is the secret
of this rags-to-riches story?

617
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:37,604
I have it on good authority
they feed Seabiscuit...

618
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,978
two pints of ice-cold beer
before every race.

619
01:11:40,049 --> 01:11:44,213
Reporting from trackside
in an equine exclusive,
Oh, my gosh!

620
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:47,551
- this is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin,
Movietone News.
- Who was that?

621
01:11:50,559 --> 01:11:52,618
Ahh.

622
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:56,988
Morning.

623
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:01,196
What... What's this?
It's beer.

624
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:03,397
From an admiring public.

625
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:05,838
It's pretty good too.
There's more in there.

626
01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:13,078
Where's the horse?
Signing autographs.

627
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:14,776
He what?

628
01:12:16,952 --> 01:12:19,819
Here you go, Max.
Let it dry for a minute
before you sell it.

629
01:12:19,889 --> 01:12:22,756
Hey, Charles. You think
you can break the record?

630
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:25,020
Oh, let's ask him.
Hey, Biscuit.

631
01:12:25,094 --> 01:12:27,756
You gonna win one more?
You gonna break the record?

632
01:12:29,331 --> 01:12:32,266
Hey, Charles.
What do you think finally
turned this horse around?

633
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:34,962
Well, I think we just
gave him a chance.

634
01:12:35,037 --> 01:12:37,130
Sometimes all somebody needs
is a second chance.

635
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:39,800
I think there are a lot
of people out there...

636
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:42,139
know just what
I'm talking about.

637
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:45,044
You got that right.

638
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:47,639
Here, boys.
Take some horseshoes with you.
Right here, Charles.

639
01:12:47,717 --> 01:12:50,379
Hey, thanks.
These are special.

640
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:53,684
- Never run out of luck.
- Great.

641
01:12:59,695 --> 01:13:03,290
Sam! Where the hell
are my horseshoes?

642
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:08,333
You quit?
I can't work like this.

643
01:13:08,404 --> 01:13:11,498
He's not a parade animal.
He's a racehorse.

644
01:13:11,574 --> 01:13:15,203
Look, Tom,
a little bit of public relations...

645
01:13:15,277 --> 01:13:17,370
I can't get him
to be a great horse...

646
01:13:17,446 --> 01:13:19,380
if I can't get the time
to work with him.

647
01:13:19,448 --> 01:13:21,746
What do you mean?
He is a great horse.

648
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:24,479
We don't know that yet.
He's won six stakes in a row.

649
01:13:24,553 --> 01:13:27,021
Against who?

650
01:13:28,758 --> 01:13:32,990
This... This is a great horse.

651
01:13:41,337 --> 01:13:44,204
First he smashed them
in the Kentucky Derby.

652
01:13:44,273 --> 01:13:46,503
Then he crushed them
in the Preakness.

653
01:13:47,877 --> 01:13:51,938
Then he destroyed
all comers in the Belmont
to snatch the Triple Crown.

654
01:13:52,014 --> 01:13:54,608
At almost 18 hands,
he's as big as he is fast.

655
01:13:54,683 --> 01:13:58,619
Eighteen hands?
Can't be too fast a runner.

656
01:13:58,687 --> 01:14:01,417
Yeah, he's big.

657
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:05,392
Born of perfect breeding,
displaying perfect form,
boasting a perfect record,

658
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:09,955
the millionaire Mr. Riddle
may have finally created
the perfect horse.

659
01:14:10,032 --> 01:14:13,468
Until next time,
this is Horace Halstedter
for Metrotone News.

660
01:14:15,004 --> 01:14:17,097
What the hell
does that mean anyway?

661
01:14:17,173 --> 01:14:19,403
Perfect. He's perfect.

662
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:21,443
What the hell
does "perfect" mean?

663
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:24,411
What?
You show me something
that's perfect,

664
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,074
I'll show you something
that's not.

665
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,713
Look, he's obviously
the best horse in the East.

666
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:35,723
We're obviously
the best horse in the West.

667
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:37,884
The country deserves
to see which horse is better.

668
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,260
Yo-ho-ho-ho! You may not be able
to see it, folks, but the gauntlet
just landed on my desk.

669
01:14:42,331 --> 01:14:44,595
Are we talking about
a match race?

670
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:48,501
Whatever Mr. Riddle wants.
Match race, stakes race,
potato sack race.

671
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:51,972
Just 'cause we're littler
doesn't mean we're scared.

672
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:53,975
Right you are, and in
the heartland of America,

673
01:14:54,043 --> 01:14:55,943
every little guy knows
exactly what you mean.

674
01:14:56,011 --> 01:14:59,674
You hear that, Mr. Riddle?
You have an appointment
with destiny, a date with...

675
01:15:02,518 --> 01:15:04,645
Destiny.
Destiny. Yes, exactly.

676
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,848
So destiny,
and his name is Seabiscuit.

677
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:10,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:14,621
Does Seabiscuit stand a chance...
I'm glad they finally have racing
in California.

679
01:15:14,697 --> 01:15:17,131
Do they use
Western saddles out there?

680
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,667
- Look.

681
01:15:19,735 --> 01:15:22,397
Comparing these two horses
is ridiculous.

682
01:15:22,471 --> 01:15:24,666
War Admiral
is a real racehorse...

683
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,334
who's won every prestigious race
in America.

684
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:31,311
This little colt of theirs
is running out on some cow track.

685
01:15:33,549 --> 01:15:35,540
If we responded
to every fledgling challenger...

686
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:38,519
who wants to make
a name for themselves,

687
01:15:38,587 --> 01:15:40,680
it wouldn't be fair to us.

688
01:15:40,756 --> 01:15:43,190
But it wouldn't be fair
to them either.

689
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:46,057
You wouldn't put Jack Dempsey
in the ring with a middleweight.

690
01:15:46,128 --> 01:15:47,561
Huh?

691
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,121
Would you?

692
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:53,066
"Middleweight"?
I'll kill him.

693
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:55,069
I'll knock
his goddamn block off!

694
01:15:55,137 --> 01:15:57,071
He's chicken!
I know. I know.

695
01:15:57,139 --> 01:15:59,232
"Middleweight"?
We just have to
flush him out.

696
01:15:59,308 --> 01:16:01,538
How?

697
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:04,807
Well, this is still America.
Right?
Yeah.

698
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,713
Cash.

699
01:16:07,783 --> 01:16:11,514
- A hundred thousand dollars?
- The biggest purse
in American history.

700
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:15,648
I sure hope so.
You'd get every top Eastern
thoroughbred. All of'em.

701
01:16:15,724 --> 01:16:18,249
You'd put this place on the map.

702
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:21,194
They might have all that
blue blood crap.

703
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:23,390
Our money
is just as good as theirs.

704
01:16:23,465 --> 01:16:26,298
Charlie...
Doc, this is our moment.

705
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:29,269
Now, they're stuck in the past.
This is the future.

706
01:16:29,338 --> 01:16:31,704
Great.

707
01:16:31,774 --> 01:16:34,743
Come here.
What?

708
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,903
Come on.
Don't you wanna see 'em?

709
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:42,178
Pilin' off of those train cars.
Comin' out here to your track.

710
01:16:43,285 --> 01:16:46,254
Huh? That's victory
in itself.

711
01:16:46,322 --> 01:16:48,085
Doc?

712
01:16:48,157 --> 01:16:51,285
That's...
That's the finish line
right there.

713
01:16:53,362 --> 01:16:55,421
You sell cars like this?

714
01:16:55,497 --> 01:16:57,431
Hundreds of'em.

715
01:16:57,499 --> 01:16:59,490
Hold your horses!
Hold your horses!

716
01:16:59,568 --> 01:17:02,935
Just when you thought you'd
seen it all, Doc Strub
has raided the cookie jar.

717
01:17:03,005 --> 01:17:07,169
He has smashed the piggy bank
and sold the family silver.
$100,000 for one horse race?

718
01:17:07,242 --> 01:17:09,802
Makes me want to
throw a saddle on my back.

719
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:13,905
Will the Biscuit be the favorite?
Not likely, folks.
We're about to be invaded.

720
01:17:13,983 --> 01:17:16,577
We're talking Derby winners,

721
01:17:16,652 --> 01:17:18,643
Preakness winners,
Belmont winners.

722
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,917
Hold on, hold on.
I guess that's all one horse.

723
01:17:21,991 --> 01:17:25,256
But at 100,000 bucks,
how can the Admiral
not want to dock his ship...

724
01:17:25,327 --> 01:17:27,261
in this friendly port?

725
01:17:27,329 --> 01:17:30,298
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin
live from Clockers' Corner.

726
01:17:32,668 --> 01:17:36,627
They raised a hundred grand!
Hey, how 'bout
that hundred grander?

727
01:17:38,007 --> 01:17:39,941
No, thanks.

728
01:17:40,009 --> 01:17:42,102
Excuse me, boys.

729
01:17:42,177 --> 01:17:44,077
Shit!
Charles!

730
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:47,343
Shit.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

731
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:49,407
The hell with it.
We'll run him anyway.

732
01:17:49,485 --> 01:17:52,079
There are still going to be
the greatest horses
in the world,

733
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:54,782
and if we win this thing,
they're gonna have to face us.

734
01:17:54,857 --> 01:17:58,088
He's gonna have to face us.

735
01:18:05,834 --> 01:18:09,270
Okay. Special Agent's
pure speed.

736
01:18:09,338 --> 01:18:12,034
He's gonna go to the lead,
but he can't handle the distance.

737
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:14,405
So don't get sucked in.
I won't.

738
01:18:14,476 --> 01:18:16,637
Indian Broom
could be there too.

739
01:18:16,712 --> 01:18:21,149
We'll know they're holdin' him back
if they use the ring bit.

740
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:26,210
Now, the one to worry about
is Rosemont.

741
01:18:26,288 --> 01:18:28,882
He closes
like a freight train,

742
01:18:28,957 --> 01:18:31,118
and he'll fight you for it
at the end.

743
01:18:31,193 --> 01:18:33,388
You gotta have
some momentum built up...

744
01:18:33,462 --> 01:18:36,022
by the time
he makes his move.

745
01:18:36,098 --> 01:18:39,363
It's still kind of soggy out there
from the other day,

746
01:18:39,435 --> 01:18:43,166
so try to stay off the rail
where it's deep.

747
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,230
I figured I'd sit back
about three wide.

748
01:18:46,308 --> 01:18:48,367
Yeah, that's fine.

749
01:18:50,045 --> 01:18:52,707
And other than that, just...

750
01:18:53,782 --> 01:18:55,716
just try to feel it.

751
01:18:57,786 --> 01:18:59,777
He'll tell you
when he's ready.

752
01:20:31,747 --> 01:20:33,942
Yeah, boy!

753
01:20:36,985 --> 01:20:38,452
Come on, Red!

754
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,990
Ha! Ha!

755
01:20:56,738 --> 01:20:58,865
Yeah, come on.
Go! Go!

756
01:21:07,249 --> 01:21:10,013
- Whoo-hoo!
- Watch him. Watch him.

757
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,656
Come on! Come on!

758
01:21:26,635 --> 01:21:28,569
It's not my fault.
Not this time.

759
01:21:28,637 --> 01:21:31,128
I told you look out
for Rosemont.
I thought I had it.

760
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:33,367
You stopped ridin'!
I couldn't see him!

761
01:21:33,442 --> 01:21:36,104
What are you talkin' about?
He was flyin' up your tail!

762
01:21:36,178 --> 01:21:38,646
Yeah, well, I can't...
What?

763
01:21:38,714 --> 01:21:40,705
See out there!

764
01:21:48,056 --> 01:21:50,422
He lied to us.
What?

765
01:21:50,492 --> 01:21:53,427
He lied to us.
You want a jockey
who lies to us?

766
01:21:53,495 --> 01:21:56,430
What do you mean?

767
01:21:56,498 --> 01:22:00,662
He can't see.
He's blind in one eye.

768
01:22:24,059 --> 01:22:26,118
It's fine, Tom.

769
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,698
- It's fine?
- Yeah, it's fine.

770
01:22:34,736 --> 01:22:36,795
"You don't throw
a whole life away...

771
01:22:36,872 --> 01:22:40,137
just 'cause it's banged up
a little bit."

772
01:22:43,178 --> 01:22:45,169
Good night.

773
01:22:47,349 --> 01:22:50,443
All right, all right.
Hold it.

774
01:22:50,519 --> 01:22:52,487
Well, I guess
that little horse of theirs...

775
01:22:52,554 --> 01:22:54,784
turned out to be
a glorified claimer after all.

776
01:22:54,856 --> 01:22:57,586
Huh?

777
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:01,390
Well, at least we don't have
to deal with this David and
Goliath nonsense anymore.

778
01:23:01,463 --> 01:23:04,193
Huh? Huh?
You can say that again.

779
01:23:04,266 --> 01:23:06,962
All right, boys.
Let me through.
Wait a minute. Mr. Riddle...

780
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,471
The hell with it.

781
01:23:23,151 --> 01:23:25,085
Just a couple of announcements.

782
01:23:25,153 --> 01:23:29,146
First, Red Pollard will remain
Seabiscuit's jockey,

783
01:23:29,224 --> 01:23:31,158
now and forever.

784
01:23:31,226 --> 01:23:35,663
Second, if they're too scared
to come and race us,
we're gonna go find them.

785
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:38,461
We're gonna enter every race
where War Admiral is on the card,

786
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:41,661
and if he scratches,
which he probably will,

787
01:23:41,737 --> 01:23:43,830
we'll enter the next race
he's on the card.

788
01:23:43,905 --> 01:23:47,136
And we won't come home
until we've faced him,
win, lose or draw.

789
01:23:49,144 --> 01:23:51,874
You know,

790
01:23:51,947 --> 01:23:54,780
I'd rather have one horse like this
than a hundred War Admirals.

791
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:58,809
- Thanks, fellas.

792
01:24:09,331 --> 01:24:11,561
Gotta see him.!
Come on.!

793
01:24:21,476 --> 01:24:24,445
Look, I, uh...
I really don't know what to say.

794
01:24:24,513 --> 01:24:26,447
Uh, we appreciate it.

795
01:24:26,515 --> 01:24:28,642
I'm sure the Biscuit
appreciates it too.

796
01:24:28,717 --> 01:24:31,811
He's just a little shy
about speaking in public.

797
01:24:31,887 --> 01:24:34,378
He'd thank you himself.

798
01:24:35,624 --> 01:24:39,492
I guess, uh,
you all are here today...

799
01:24:39,561 --> 01:24:42,758
because this is a horse
who won't give up.

800
01:24:42,831 --> 01:24:46,858
That's right.
Even when life
beats him by a nose.

801
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:49,028
That's right.!
Ain't that the truth.

802
01:24:50,138 --> 01:24:53,869
But, heck,
everybody loses a couple.

803
01:24:53,942 --> 01:24:56,308
Yes, sir.

804
01:24:56,378 --> 01:24:59,245
And you either pack up
and you go home,
or you keep fighting!

805
01:24:59,314 --> 01:25:00,906
Isn't that right?
Yeah!

806
01:25:00,982 --> 01:25:04,281
- That's right.!
- That's right.

807
01:25:04,352 --> 01:25:06,877
Now,

808
01:25:06,955 --> 01:25:09,116
do you want to see a match race?
Yeah.!

809
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,785
Yeah!
You do?

810
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:15,023
Yeah.!
You wanna see this young fella
ridin' that horse?

811
01:25:15,096 --> 01:25:16,927
- Yeah!
- Yes!

812
01:25:16,998 --> 01:25:18,590
Seabiscuit!

813
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:23,897
Extra.! Extra.!
Biscuit on the warpath.!

814
01:25:23,972 --> 01:25:27,464
Will there be a match race?
It's all right here.

815
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:30,010
Extra.! Extra.!
Biscuit on the warpath.!

816
01:25:30,078 --> 01:25:32,069
I don't know what
they're so worried about.

817
01:25:32,147 --> 01:25:35,639
I mean, look at us.
Our horse is too small.

818
01:25:35,717 --> 01:25:37,776
Our jockey's too big.

819
01:25:37,853 --> 01:25:40,287
- Our trainer is too old.

820
01:25:40,355 --> 01:25:43,483
Forgive me, Tom.
And I'm too dumb
to know the difference!

821
01:25:43,558 --> 01:25:47,551
- Yeah, Charlie!
- You'd think they'd want to race us
instead of running away!

822
01:25:47,629 --> 01:25:49,620
Yeah.!

823
01:25:57,339 --> 01:26:01,105
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am staring at
a swarm of humanity,

824
01:26:01,176 --> 01:26:04,441
a sea of hungry faces demanding
the match of a lifetime.

825
01:26:04,513 --> 01:26:07,448
They have come here tonight
in the cold, in the wind,

826
01:26:07,516 --> 01:26:10,314
In the chill of a late
October night.

827
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:14,515
Let me make my way
over to one of them so you
can hear it for yourself.

828
01:26:14,589 --> 01:26:16,523
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

829
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:18,525
Ma'am, ma'am, if I may.

830
01:26:18,593 --> 01:26:21,027
What brings you out here tonight
with your three small children,

831
01:26:21,096 --> 01:26:23,462
clamoring for a view
of this little horse?

832
01:26:23,532 --> 01:26:25,523
Because we want to see
a match race!

833
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:31,464
I said, don't you think...

834
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:33,531
Mr. Riddle
owes this country a...

835
01:26:33,608 --> 01:26:35,439
Match race!

836
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:38,946
Match race.!
Match race.! Match race.!

837
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:42,381
Match race.!
Match race.! Match race.!

838
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:44,680
Match race.! Match race.!

839
01:26:45,854 --> 01:26:47,788
Fine, but it's on my terms.

840
01:26:47,856 --> 01:26:49,687
Any terms you want.

841
01:26:49,758 --> 01:26:52,693
Mile and 3/16ths.
I won't accept anything else.

842
01:26:52,761 --> 01:26:55,321
All right.
Want a walk-up start
with a bell.

843
01:26:56,598 --> 01:26:58,657
We won't be using
any contraptions.

844
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:01,167
You mean a starting gate?

845
01:27:02,737 --> 01:27:07,071
- Fine.
- And we run it here,
at our home track.

846
01:27:07,142 --> 01:27:09,133
That's not negotiable.

847
01:27:10,278 --> 01:27:12,371
Mmm. Seems like
a nice enough place.

848
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:16,640
Oh, I'm sure you'll find it
quite comfortable,
Mr. Howard.

849
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:28,391
Jesus Christ.!

850
01:27:28,463 --> 01:27:31,296
I wanna be a horse.

851
01:27:31,366 --> 01:27:34,301
Well, you're almost
big enough.

852
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:36,701
That's very funny.

853
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:39,604
It doesn't even smell
like a barn.

854
01:27:39,674 --> 01:27:42,768
Hmm. They probably
deodorize it every morning.

855
01:27:42,844 --> 01:27:44,778
Well, they still crap.

856
01:27:47,415 --> 01:27:51,078
Well, they do.
They do.

857
01:27:51,152 --> 01:27:53,052
Over here, pal. Right over here!

858
01:27:53,121 --> 01:27:56,113
There you go!
This way.
This way.

859
01:27:56,191 --> 01:27:58,125
Biscuit, here...

860
01:27:58,193 --> 01:28:00,127
Whoa.!
What's that thing?

861
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:05,959
They got us
in the servants' quarters.

862
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:09,231
Is that him?
No.

863
01:28:11,272 --> 01:28:13,263
Bit too small.

864
01:28:15,877 --> 01:28:17,811
That's him.

865
01:28:20,115 --> 01:28:22,743
Oh, my God.

866
01:28:29,557 --> 01:28:32,822
Maybe he's the kind of horse
that just looks good
in the paddock.

867
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,868
Wow.

868
01:28:43,104 --> 01:28:45,265
We gotta get to the lead.

869
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:47,501
Biscuit never goes
to the lead.

870
01:28:47,575 --> 01:28:51,909
I know,
but... we gotta teach him
to break first.

871
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:55,279
If that monster shakes loose,

872
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,409
we'll never catch him.

873
01:28:58,486 --> 01:29:00,613
What, retrain him?

874
01:29:03,858 --> 01:29:06,452
We got two weeks.

875
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:16,428
Excuse me.

876
01:29:16,504 --> 01:29:18,529
Uh,

877
01:29:18,606 --> 01:29:21,439
we'd like to buy
your bell.

878
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:26,912
They didn't tell me
you were comin'.
Oh, probably just an oversight.

879
01:29:26,981 --> 01:29:28,915
Do you want me
to turn on some lights?

880
01:29:28,983 --> 01:29:30,644
No. No.
No?

881
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:35,588
Okay. It's a predatory
response.

882
01:29:35,657 --> 01:29:37,989
If I just brush it
past his flank,

883
01:29:38,059 --> 01:29:39,993
he'll bolt.

884
01:29:40,061 --> 01:29:43,462
- We want to teach him
to do it with the bell.
- How far you want me to take him?

885
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:46,989
A hundred feet.
Just so he learns to break first.

886
01:29:47,068 --> 01:29:49,400
Okay. Got it.

887
01:29:50,638 --> 01:29:53,630
- You ready?
- Ready.

888
01:30:17,499 --> 01:30:20,593
All right.
Here we go.

889
01:30:37,318 --> 01:30:41,448
Oh, come on, Tom!
When you gonna work that horse out?

890
01:30:42,757 --> 01:30:44,691
When he wakes up, I guess.

891
01:30:44,759 --> 01:30:47,592
Geez!

892
01:30:47,662 --> 01:30:49,459
For cryin'out loud.!

893
01:30:51,132 --> 01:30:53,066
The whole track?

894
01:30:53,134 --> 01:30:55,762
I just want him
to do it once...

895
01:30:55,837 --> 01:30:57,862
with nothin'
in front of him.

896
01:30:57,939 --> 01:31:01,534
- Yeah, but I can't see out there.
- That's all right. He can.

897
01:31:01,609 --> 01:31:05,238
Aw, come on, Tom.
Tom, please. Wha...

898
01:31:05,313 --> 01:31:07,645
Why do you always
have to do this? Shit!

899
01:31:07,715 --> 01:31:11,207
- Oh, great.

900
01:31:14,289 --> 01:31:16,814
Jesus Christ.

901
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:24,254
Wow. Huh.

902
01:31:25,433 --> 01:31:27,628
Oh, my God.

903
01:31:39,547 --> 01:31:41,538
Tim.
Hey.

904
01:31:43,218 --> 01:31:45,982
Pumpkin. Hey.

905
01:31:46,054 --> 01:31:48,887
How ya doin', Pumpkin?

906
01:31:48,957 --> 01:31:51,425
Ohhh. Are you shy?

907
01:31:52,927 --> 01:31:54,986
Hey, Red?

908
01:31:57,699 --> 01:31:59,690
Oh, my gosh.

909
01:32:00,768 --> 01:32:04,135
Yeah. Guess I should have
used you as a jockey
instead of a groom.

910
01:32:04,205 --> 01:32:06,469
No, no. It was...

911
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:08,475
That was great.

912
01:32:09,544 --> 01:32:11,535
Look, I-I'm in a little trouble.

913
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:15,310
I got this horse over in Annex,
and I been tryin'
to sell a share of him.

914
01:32:15,383 --> 01:32:17,283
Tough times and all?

915
01:32:17,352 --> 01:32:20,549
I was wonderin' if...
if maybe you'd breeze him for me.

916
01:32:20,622 --> 01:32:23,887
If folks saw
Red Pollard...

917
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:26,426
Yeah. I'll breeze
your horse for you.

918
01:32:29,597 --> 01:32:31,531
It's on.
Good.

919
01:32:31,599 --> 01:32:33,863
Just take him
for five furlongs
at around a minute-one.

920
01:32:33,935 --> 01:32:36,904
Can he do that?
Should.

921
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:43,700
Try it now.

922
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:55,983
Okay, try it again.

923
01:32:58,493 --> 01:33:01,360
- Whoa! Whoa!

924
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:04,330
- Easy! Easy! Easy!

925
01:33:17,011 --> 01:33:20,742
Aaah!

926
01:33:22,283 --> 01:33:24,342
- Stop it!
- Whoa.!

927
01:33:59,687 --> 01:34:03,384
Look, most of the damage
was restricted to his leg.
How bad is it?

928
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:06,450
God, I don't know.
It's, uh, shattered.

929
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:09,121
Eleven, 12 breaks.
Something like that.

930
01:34:09,197 --> 01:34:12,462
We're gonna
have to operate.

931
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:14,728
Just sit tight for me.

932
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:58,544
Well, we're all done.

933
01:34:58,613 --> 01:35:01,707
He'll always limp,
but, uh, it looks like
he's gonna walk again.

934
01:35:01,783 --> 01:35:05,184
W-Will he ride?

935
01:35:05,253 --> 01:35:08,051
No, he's not gonna ride.

936
01:35:08,122 --> 01:35:11,717
Y-You're sure?
He won't ride.
He's gonna walk.

937
01:35:11,793 --> 01:35:13,920
You take care.

938
01:35:13,995 --> 01:35:15,986
Th... Thank you.

939
01:35:19,867 --> 01:35:21,528
Hey.

940
01:35:21,602 --> 01:35:24,435
Uh, you should see
the other guy.

941
01:35:24,505 --> 01:35:28,999
You're gonna be fine.
Couple of months, you're gonna
be up and around like new.

942
01:35:29,077 --> 01:35:33,741
I'm the one
who makes up the stories,
remember?

943
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:37,407
Well, yeah.

944
01:35:37,485 --> 01:35:40,318
Uh, maybe a little longer
than that.

945
01:35:40,388 --> 01:35:42,379
Yeah.

946
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:49,328
Look, I, uh... I think we're
gonna have to scratch.

947
01:35:49,397 --> 01:35:52,924
No.
No, don't scratch.

948
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,094
Son, he's a great horse,
but he can't run by himself.

949
01:35:56,170 --> 01:35:59,071
Don't scratch.

950
01:36:04,512 --> 01:36:07,845
Call Woolf.

951
01:36:07,915 --> 01:36:12,045
- Son, nobody's riding...
- It's okay.

952
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,179
Call him.

953
01:36:14,255 --> 01:36:16,189
Are you gonna scratch?

954
01:36:16,257 --> 01:36:18,191
No, we're not
gonna scratch.

955
01:36:18,259 --> 01:36:21,422
Red Pollard wants Seabiscuit
to win this race more than anything
in the world.

956
01:36:21,496 --> 01:36:23,396
He wouldn't let us scratch.

957
01:36:23,464 --> 01:36:26,024
Thank you much.
I appreciate it.

958
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:28,591
You're welcome.

959
01:36:28,669 --> 01:36:31,069
The Iceman cometh.!
What a pinch hitter.

960
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:35,200
Why, it's like getting Babe Ruth
off the bench. Nerves of steel,
ice water in his veins.

961
01:36:35,276 --> 01:36:37,210
Why, George Woolf is...

962
01:36:37,278 --> 01:36:39,212
Irrelevant.

963
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,272
They can get the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse
as far as I'm concerned.

964
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:46,377
Won't make any difference.
War Admiral is a superior horse
with superior breeding.

965
01:36:46,454 --> 01:36:48,979
Doesn't matter
who the passenger is.

966
01:36:51,526 --> 01:36:53,687
He's got a strong left lead,
Georgie.

967
01:36:53,761 --> 01:36:55,922
Banks like
a friggin' airplane.

968
01:36:55,997 --> 01:36:59,797
He might need help
switching to it, so ease him
off the rail just before the turn.

969
01:36:59,867 --> 01:37:02,802
Like you did
in the Gold Cup.
Exactly.

970
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,634
He needs a good warm-up,
so take him out slow.

971
01:37:05,706 --> 01:37:08,334
When you do ask him,
don't use the whip.

972
01:37:08,409 --> 01:37:12,311
Just flick it twice,
show him it's there.
He'll know it's time.

973
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:15,315
Right.

974
01:37:15,383 --> 01:37:18,750
And, um, never on the left side.

975
01:37:18,819 --> 01:37:22,152
They hit him on the left side
when he was a baby.

976
01:37:22,223 --> 01:37:25,454
I wish it was you, Johnny.
Aw, come on.

977
01:37:25,526 --> 01:37:28,586
I'll be right there with you.

978
01:37:30,464 --> 01:37:33,024
Aaah!

979
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:36,365
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya!

980
01:37:38,172 --> 01:37:42,165
Great. Now, show him the stick
at the quarter pole,

981
01:37:42,243 --> 01:37:45,144
and he'll give you
a whole new gear.

982
01:37:49,684 --> 01:37:51,515
Okay, now,

983
01:37:51,586 --> 01:37:55,044
force him to that left lead
a little earlier,

984
01:37:55,122 --> 01:37:58,148
and he'll give you even more.

985
01:38:00,394 --> 01:38:02,555
Great.

986
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:04,495
Now, shut the door.

987
01:38:20,715 --> 01:38:25,709
Okay. You know how Smith
wants you to fight for the lead
by the first turn?

988
01:38:25,786 --> 01:38:29,415
Yeah. We were workin'
with that bell.

989
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:32,550
I was a little nervous
about that.
No, that's fine.

990
01:38:32,627 --> 01:38:35,425
But you gotta give it up
on the backstretch.

991
01:38:35,496 --> 01:38:38,761
Give it up?
Give him back the lead.

992
01:38:40,067 --> 01:38:42,092
He fights for it, Georgie.

993
01:38:42,169 --> 01:38:45,468
If you bring him head to head
with that other horse,

994
01:38:45,539 --> 01:38:47,700
and he looks him in the eye,

995
01:38:47,775 --> 01:38:50,243
there's no way
he loses that race.

996
01:38:50,311 --> 01:38:54,213
You just hold him
through that final turn...

997
01:38:54,282 --> 01:38:56,944
and let him get
a good look at the Admiral.

998
01:38:57,018 --> 01:38:59,782
Then let him go.

999
01:38:59,854 --> 01:39:03,449
It's not in his feet, Georgie.

1000
01:39:03,524 --> 01:39:06,118
It's right here.

1001
01:39:11,432 --> 01:39:13,900
By 10:00 a.m.
The closest place to park...

1002
01:39:13,968 --> 01:39:16,061
was 15 blocks away.

1003
01:39:16,137 --> 01:39:19,072
The volume of refreshments alone
was staggering.

1004
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:21,938
Seventeen thousand gallons
of lemonade.

1005
01:39:22,009 --> 01:39:24,876
Sixty thousand hot dogs.

1006
01:39:24,945 --> 01:39:28,073
Two thousand kegs of beer.

1007
01:39:28,149 --> 01:39:30,140
NBC broadcast the race,

1008
01:39:30,217 --> 01:39:33,914
and businesses around America
scheduled a half day of work...

1009
01:39:33,988 --> 01:39:36,115
so their employees
could hear the call,

1010
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:39,523
thanks, in part, to a missive
fired by Mr. Howard only the day before.

1011
01:39:39,593 --> 01:39:42,255
Look, I know this is
a fancy track and all,

1012
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:44,662
but I think they oughta
open up the infield...

1013
01:39:44,732 --> 01:39:47,565
so normal folks
can come see the race.

1014
01:39:47,635 --> 01:39:50,433
You shouldn't have to be rich
to enjoy something like this.

1015
01:39:50,504 --> 01:39:54,736
Seabiscuit entered the race
a two-to-one underdog,

1016
01:39:54,809 --> 01:39:57,744
but you would never know it
from the growing noise
in the infield.

1017
01:39:57,812 --> 01:39:59,439
Get your program.!

1018
01:39:59,513 --> 01:40:02,676
By the time it was over,
more than 40 million Americans...

1019
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:05,116
would hear the call.

1020
01:40:05,186 --> 01:40:09,520
Okay, it's... it's still
kinda soggy at the rail,

1021
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:12,753
so try to keep him
out of there.

1022
01:40:12,827 --> 01:40:16,456
There's a dry tractor tread
about five feet out off the fence.

1023
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:19,522
I walked the track
this morning.

1024
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,864
Good. Good.

1025
01:40:21,936 --> 01:40:26,669
Now, he oughta break
just like we worked on.

1026
01:40:28,209 --> 01:40:32,043
But, um,
there's one more thing.

1027
01:40:32,113 --> 01:40:35,105
What? Let him catch me
on the backstretch?

1028
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:39,285
You're not the only one
who knows this horse.

1029
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:44,722
Safe trip, George.

1030
01:40:44,792 --> 01:40:47,625
And a short one.
Let's go, Sam.

1031
01:40:55,469 --> 01:40:58,131
Charley!
George. Huh.

1032
01:40:58,205 --> 01:41:00,639
The two jockeys have
acknowledged each other.

1033
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,939
It's a quick hello,
like boxers touching gloves.

1034
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:06,343
Come on, George.
This is no time
for small talk.

1035
01:41:06,414 --> 01:41:09,906
Both the horses are now
on the main track, and you can hear
the roar from the crowd.

1036
01:41:33,507 --> 01:41:35,771
There he is!

1037
01:42:44,378 --> 01:42:47,176
It's Seabiscuit by a nose,
now by a head.

1038
01:42:47,248 --> 01:42:51,844
He's leading War Admiral,
pressing on him a neck behind.

1039
01:42:51,919 --> 01:42:56,686
They fly toward the clubhouse turn.
Who will be into it first?

1040
01:42:56,757 --> 01:43:00,784
It's Seabiscuit, and he was there first
and driving for the backstretch.!

1041
01:43:08,969 --> 01:43:12,996
Now, coming into the backstretch,
it's Seabiscuit.

1042
01:43:13,073 --> 01:43:16,270
Going down the backstretch.

1043
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:33,989
Now, back him off, son.
Back him off. Back him off.

1044
01:43:36,931 --> 01:43:39,798
Come on back, George.
Come on, come on, come on.

1045
01:43:39,867 --> 01:43:43,769
Now on the backstretch,
Seabiscuit still with the lead.

1046
01:43:43,837 --> 01:43:46,135
Come on, Georgie.
Don't fool around.

1047
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:51,644
I sure hope you're right, Red.
Here we go.

1048
01:43:51,712 --> 01:43:53,646
Easy, Pops.

1049
01:43:59,486 --> 01:44:01,420
Goddamn it, Johnny.

1050
01:44:11,732 --> 01:44:15,998
It's now War Admiral.!
It's War Admiral.!

1051
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:19,904
It's Seabiscuit and War Admiral,
neck and neck as they go
down the backstretch.!

1052
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,513
Close, Pops.
Easy, Pops.

1053
01:44:30,918 --> 01:44:33,546
That's it.
Whoo.

1054
01:44:39,526 --> 01:44:42,552
It's Seabiscuit. Now War Admiral.!
Now Seabiscuit.! Now War Admiral.!

1055
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:44,427
Not going now, Pops.

1056
01:44:59,813 --> 01:45:01,906
Do it.

1057
01:45:01,982 --> 01:45:03,973
Do it now.
Come on, George!

1058
01:45:04,051 --> 01:45:07,145
- Turn him loose. Turn him loose.
- Do it now, George!

1059
01:45:08,822 --> 01:45:10,983
So long, Charley!

1060
01:45:11,058 --> 01:45:13,219
Hyah!

1061
01:45:14,328 --> 01:45:18,628
- Turn him loose!
- Here comes Seabiscuit.!

1062
01:45:23,637 --> 01:45:26,470
It's Seabiscuit going away.!

1063
01:45:29,309 --> 01:45:32,176
Come on, Biscuit!

1064
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:49,357
Yes! Yes! Whoo! Yes!

1065
01:46:52,626 --> 01:46:54,685
Congratulations.

1066
01:46:54,762 --> 01:46:57,196
Amazing.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1067
01:46:57,264 --> 01:47:00,256
Iceman, you did it.
How does it feel?

1068
01:47:00,334 --> 01:47:03,667
Well, I just wish my good friend
Red Pollard was up here today
instead of me.

1069
01:47:03,737 --> 01:47:05,728
He will be.

1070
01:47:09,710 --> 01:47:14,010
This concludes our radio broadcast
of the race of the century.

1071
01:47:14,081 --> 01:47:17,448
Now a word from our sponsor,
the American Oil Company.

1072
01:47:17,518 --> 01:47:20,919
Money can't buy
a finer motor oil...

1073
01:47:39,006 --> 01:47:41,566
Easy does it.

1074
01:47:41,642 --> 01:47:44,668
Watch it. Wa...
Watch those wheels.

1075
01:48:37,998 --> 01:48:41,661
All hail the conquering hero.
Yes, folks, he's back.
The little engine that could.

1076
01:48:41,735 --> 01:48:45,501
No more match races for this
little pony because, quite frankly,
they're all outta matches.

1077
01:48:45,572 --> 01:48:49,167
Who's he gonna race? Pegasus?
I pity these other horses. Heh.

1078
01:50:45,025 --> 01:50:47,357
When will they know?
I don't know.

1079
01:50:47,427 --> 01:50:50,988
Maybe an hour. I'm not sure.
Charles is with the vet right now.

1080
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,360
Does it hurt when he bends it?
'Cause if it doesn't hurt
when he bends it...

1081
01:50:56,436 --> 01:50:59,166
We don't know anything yet.
I'll call you as soon as we do.

1082
01:50:59,239 --> 01:51:01,730
I promise.
All right.

1083
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,917
He was runnin' easy on me.
There was no warning.

1084
01:51:10,984 --> 01:51:13,782
He's gotta be all right.
He's gotta be all right.

1085
01:51:15,689 --> 01:51:18,055
Mr. Howard.

1086
01:51:24,164 --> 01:51:28,430
Well, he ruptured
a whole ligament.

1087
01:51:28,502 --> 01:51:31,562
I put a splint on him
just to keep him immobilized,

1088
01:51:31,638 --> 01:51:33,868
but right now
he's totally lame.

1089
01:51:35,609 --> 01:51:37,543
He's not gonna race again.

1090
01:51:41,948 --> 01:51:44,678
Look, um...

1091
01:51:45,752 --> 01:51:50,416
I know this is hard,
but I'll put him down for you
if you want me to.

1092
01:52:26,693 --> 01:52:29,787
Oh, that's okay, Pops.
I'll come to you.

1093
01:52:36,036 --> 01:52:38,027
Hey.

1094
01:52:50,917 --> 01:52:52,908
Mmm.

1095
01:53:10,437 --> 01:53:12,701
See,

1096
01:53:12,772 --> 01:53:16,503
first you gotta get
a little flexibility.

1097
01:53:16,576 --> 01:53:19,306
Yeah. Then you can
put weight on it.

1098
01:53:19,379 --> 01:53:23,679
Then once you start
to put weight on it,
the whole leg gets stronger.

1099
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:27,277
I know. I know.
I'm in a hurry too, Pops.

1100
01:53:27,354 --> 01:53:30,323
But you know what Hadrian
said about Rome.

1101
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:32,881
"Brick by brick, my citizens.

1102
01:53:32,959 --> 01:53:35,052
Brick by brick."

1103
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:38,794
See,

1104
01:53:38,865 --> 01:53:40,992
they're Arabians,

1105
01:53:41,067 --> 01:53:43,297
so they don't need
to drink.

1106
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:47,534
These horses can go
five or six days...

1107
01:53:47,607 --> 01:53:51,270
without a drop of water,
like a camel.

1108
01:53:51,344 --> 01:53:55,041
Oh. I'm not sayin'
that's what you should do.

1109
01:53:55,115 --> 01:53:58,915
I'm just saying
that's what they do.

1110
01:54:01,021 --> 01:54:03,512
Oh, good idea.

1111
01:54:04,724 --> 01:54:07,318
Take a little rest.

1112
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,798
I don't know, Red.

1113
01:54:46,866 --> 01:54:50,632
We're just gonna walk in a circle.
You think the leg
will hold you?

1114
01:54:52,105 --> 01:54:55,199
Horse weighs 1,200 pounds, Sam.
I'm an afterthought.

1115
01:54:55,275 --> 01:54:57,243
No, I mean your leg.

1116
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:07,746
Here comes Seabiscuit
charging down the lane,

1117
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:10,654
picking off competition
one by one.

1118
01:55:10,724 --> 01:55:13,318
He's third! Now second!

1119
01:55:13,393 --> 01:55:15,327
Now first!

1120
01:55:15,395 --> 01:55:17,989
And it's Seabiscuit at the wire...

1121
01:55:18,064 --> 01:55:22,467
to win the Santa Anita Handicap
with Red Pollard aboard! Yes!

1122
01:55:27,574 --> 01:55:29,565
Nice.

1123
01:55:42,922 --> 01:55:44,913
What?

1124
01:55:59,606 --> 01:56:01,597
Whoa!

1125
01:56:01,675 --> 01:56:04,200
Whoa, Pops. Easy.

1126
01:56:07,781 --> 01:56:10,181
Whoa.

1127
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:13,276
Wow. Wow, Pops.

1128
01:56:13,353 --> 01:56:15,981
You feel better,
don't you, boy?

1129
01:56:21,628 --> 01:56:24,461
It's okay, Sam.
I'm just gonna mow the lawn
a little bit.

1130
01:56:24,531 --> 01:56:27,022
Fine with me, Red.

1131
01:56:37,377 --> 01:56:41,211
Way to go!
All right.

1132
01:56:48,688 --> 01:56:51,248
Looking good.
Yeah, you're great, man!

1133
01:56:53,126 --> 01:56:56,618
Whoo!

1134
01:57:34,501 --> 01:57:36,469
Is it even possible?
Sure.

1135
01:57:36,536 --> 01:57:38,595
Most folks
don't give it a chance.

1136
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:40,764
Most folks just...

1137
01:57:42,509 --> 01:57:47,310
The best thing to do
is get him down there
and let him gallop a little.

1138
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:51,077
- That's the only way
we're really gonna know.
- Can he handle that?

1139
01:57:51,151 --> 01:57:53,949
Sure. I mean, I-I think so.

1140
01:58:16,443 --> 01:58:19,071
He worked great.
I couldn't feel a thing.

1141
01:58:19,145 --> 01:58:22,478
Why don't we give him
a full work on Friday morning.

1142
01:58:22,549 --> 01:58:25,143
Maybe six furlongs.
See what we got.

1143
01:58:25,218 --> 01:58:27,516
Sure. I'll be here.

1144
01:58:27,587 --> 01:58:29,646
Thanks, George.
You're welcome.

1145
01:58:31,758 --> 01:58:33,749
Comin' along.

1146
01:58:35,361 --> 01:58:37,625
Could he be ready?

1147
01:58:37,697 --> 01:58:41,428
For what?
Come on. You know what.

1148
01:58:48,741 --> 01:58:51,539
Top of the morning to you.

1149
01:58:51,611 --> 01:58:54,671
That's, uh...
That's a nice colt.
Who is he?

1150
01:58:54,747 --> 01:58:57,910
Just a two-year-old.
He's not ready yet.
Ah.

1151
01:58:57,984 --> 01:59:01,147
I thought maybe you were
getting a horse ready
for the hundred grander.

1152
01:59:01,221 --> 01:59:03,553
No.
Just a two-year-old.

1153
01:59:05,458 --> 01:59:07,119
Hair of the dog.

1154
01:59:09,362 --> 01:59:11,887
You been here long?
No. Just got here.

1155
01:59:11,965 --> 01:59:14,957
Catching up
on my reading.

1156
01:59:15,034 --> 01:59:18,492
Well, I'm sure
I'll see you soon.
Okeydokey.

1157
01:59:22,375 --> 01:59:25,367
- Stop the presses!
Stop the presses!

1158
01:59:25,445 --> 01:59:27,379
This isn't a scoop, folks.

1159
01:59:27,447 --> 01:59:30,280
This is three scoops
with hot fudge
and a cherry on top.

1160
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:34,081
And throw in some nuts,
'cause this little horse
drives me crazy!

1161
01:59:34,153 --> 01:59:37,850
Guess who may be working
six furlongs next Friday.

1162
01:59:37,924 --> 01:59:40,984
Guess who may be shooting
for the Big 'Cap.
Oh, my! Saints alive!

1163
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:43,324
You guessed it.
Man, oh, man!

1164
01:59:43,396 --> 01:59:45,990
Did you ever guess it!

1165
01:59:59,846 --> 02:00:04,647
A minute-12, minute-13.
Something like that.

1166
02:00:04,717 --> 02:00:07,049
He starts to labor,
just slow it down.

1167
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:10,954
Try and see how he feels...
Oh, oh. Whoa, whoa.

1168
02:00:11,024 --> 02:00:12,616
Got you.

1169
02:00:22,936 --> 02:00:25,928
That's all right, Pops.
That's okay, boy. That's okay.

1170
02:00:26,005 --> 02:00:28,633
Come here. It's okay.

1171
02:00:39,152 --> 02:00:43,145
And this, the most
unkindest cut of all.

1172
02:00:45,959 --> 02:00:49,326
Red.
Red, let me talk to you.

1173
02:00:49,395 --> 02:00:51,386
Talk to me?
You can't... Red!

1174
02:00:51,464 --> 02:00:54,297
You can't do it!
You could be crippled
for the rest of your life.

1175
02:00:54,367 --> 02:00:57,734
I was crippled
for the rest of my life.
I got better.

1176
02:00:57,804 --> 02:01:01,501
He made me better.
Hell, you made me better.

1177
02:01:04,544 --> 02:01:07,741
Jesus Christ.
Red...

1178
02:01:09,983 --> 02:01:13,851
And that's as much my horse
as it is yours.

1179
02:01:22,028 --> 02:01:25,691
That's pretty quick.
Goddamn it.

1180
02:01:25,765 --> 02:01:29,201
It's up to him, Red.
Yeah, but if he says
that I can't...

1181
02:01:29,268 --> 02:01:32,431
He's the doctor.
It's up to him.

1182
02:01:34,574 --> 02:01:36,508
You made this?

1183
02:01:36,576 --> 02:01:38,635
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1184
02:01:38,711 --> 02:01:41,646
It... It wraps around
my riding boot,

1185
02:01:41,714 --> 02:01:44,376
fasten it all the way
up the calf.
Right.

1186
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:47,783
I barely feel anything
in the stirrups.

1187
02:01:53,559 --> 02:01:57,017
Look, it could shatter
at any moment,
even right now.

1188
02:01:57,096 --> 02:02:01,226
Forget about racing.
You see that right there?
That's barely healed.

1189
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:05,999
There's no way to know
how much weight it could hold
under stress.

1190
02:02:06,072 --> 02:02:11,009
If it gets reinjured,
it's possible he could
never walk again.

1191
02:02:11,077 --> 02:02:14,911
Possible. He just said
it was possible.

1192
02:02:14,981 --> 02:02:18,075
Well, hell, anything's possible.
We proved that already,
didn't we?

1193
02:02:18,151 --> 02:02:21,678
This is different.
Yeah!
This is really different.

1194
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:29,952
It's not just a race.
It's the Santa Anita.

1195
02:02:30,029 --> 02:02:32,691
I had that race.
I was there.

1196
02:02:32,765 --> 02:02:34,699
I know.

1197
02:02:39,839 --> 02:02:44,435
# If I had a million dollars #

1198
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:47,536
What's going on?

1199
02:02:56,956 --> 02:03:00,790
Well, even... even with the brace,
it'll barely hold him.

1200
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:03,021
If he gets bumped,
if he gets jostled...

1201
02:03:03,096 --> 02:03:06,657
Do you want to know
what I think?
Of course.

1202
02:03:06,733 --> 02:03:10,726
I think it's better
to break a man's leg
than his heart.

1203
02:03:13,372 --> 02:03:15,966
It's not just the leg.
It's not!
Okay.

1204
02:03:16,042 --> 02:03:18,237
Mar, he could fall.
He could get trampled.

1205
02:03:18,311 --> 02:03:21,769
If he gets thrown
from that horse...
He could die?

1206
02:03:34,127 --> 02:03:38,257
You know,
I play with this thing
all the time too.

1207
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:44,667
And no matter how hard I try,
I can't get that damn ball
to stay in the hole.

1208
02:03:45,972 --> 02:03:48,133
It always rolls out again.

1209
02:03:55,615 --> 02:03:58,948
Just let him ride, Charles.

1210
02:04:00,119 --> 02:04:02,178
Just let him do it.

1211
02:04:09,428 --> 02:04:12,727
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat,
I could handle one comeback,
but this is ridiculous.

1212
02:04:12,799 --> 02:04:16,826
Who's next... Lazarus?
Oh, the heroism, the madness,
the excitement.

1213
02:04:16,903 --> 02:04:19,463
The largest crowd
ever to see a race
at Santa Anita!

1214
02:04:19,539 --> 02:04:22,667
Fifty-five thousand in the stands,
20,000 in the infield,

1215
02:04:22,742 --> 02:04:25,176
and it's only 12:00!

1216
02:04:43,062 --> 02:04:44,996
It's not bad.

1217
02:04:47,033 --> 02:04:49,467
St. Christopher.

1218
02:04:49,535 --> 02:04:51,560
For luck.

1219
02:04:51,637 --> 02:04:54,037
A little late for that,
don't you think?

1220
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:04,540
All right.
Let's go win us a race.

1221
02:05:20,132 --> 02:05:22,794
Ready?
Yup.

1222
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:39,884
Whichcee's the speed.

1223
02:05:39,952 --> 02:05:42,944
He's gonna be
out on the lead, but...

1224
02:05:43,022 --> 02:05:45,513
I don't think
he'll handle the distance.

1225
02:05:45,591 --> 02:05:47,923
Just stalk him
like always.

1226
02:05:47,994 --> 02:05:50,394
Right.

1227
02:05:50,463 --> 02:05:52,795
Wedding Call
could make a late run.

1228
02:05:52,865 --> 02:05:54,799
Now, he's got some guts,

1229
02:05:54,867 --> 02:05:58,359
so look out for him too.
Won't make that mistake again.

1230
02:06:03,309 --> 02:06:06,870
Relax, guys.
It's gonna be fine.

1231
02:06:06,946 --> 02:06:09,540
Okay.

1232
02:06:34,073 --> 02:06:38,442
Charles, it's gonna be great.
Thank you, Frank.
Hope so. Bless you.

1233
02:06:38,511 --> 02:06:41,002
Good luck, Mr. Howard.
Thank you.

1234
02:06:49,021 --> 02:06:51,216
Good luck.
You're lookin' good.

1235
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:53,281
Well, I feel fine.

1236
02:06:55,661 --> 02:06:59,825
Relax. Buy you a couple
of drinks, huh?

1237
02:06:59,899 --> 02:07:02,527
That's a good idea.

1238
02:07:02,601 --> 02:07:04,592
Who you bettin'on?

1239
02:07:50,383 --> 02:07:52,317
Hey, old man.

1240
02:07:52,385 --> 02:07:54,319
What are you doing here?

1241
02:07:54,387 --> 02:07:58,050
Got another mount.
Just 'cause I'm not riding him
doesn't mean I'm gonna sit it out.

1242
02:07:58,124 --> 02:08:02,493
Don't worry.
I don't stand a chance.

1243
02:08:02,561 --> 02:08:04,995
I'll see you at the finish.

1244
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:57,544
Aaah.

1245
02:09:05,558 --> 02:09:07,924
Aaah.

1246
02:09:23,309 --> 02:09:25,243
Come on, boy.

1247
02:09:25,311 --> 02:09:27,939
Come on. Come on!

1248
02:09:33,752 --> 02:09:36,949
Hyah! Come on! Go!

1249
02:09:56,675 --> 02:09:59,109
- How you doin', Red?
- Georgie.

1250
02:09:59,178 --> 02:10:01,806
You guys all right?

1251
02:10:04,683 --> 02:10:07,151
There you go, boy.

1252
02:10:08,888 --> 02:10:11,618
There it is.
Have a nice ride, Johnny.

1253
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:18,055
Come on, Pops.
Ha.! Ha.!

1254
02:10:21,133 --> 02:10:23,624
Go on with it, Johnny!
Go on!

1255
02:10:33,212 --> 02:10:35,077
Come on, Red!

1256
02:10:42,922 --> 02:10:46,722
Whoo-hoo!
There it is, boy.

1257
02:10:46,792 --> 02:10:48,817
Come on, Biscuit!

1258
02:11:23,195 --> 02:11:27,689
You know, everybody thinks we found
this broken-down horse and fixed him,

1259
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:31,363
but we didn't.

1260
02:11:32,871 --> 02:11:34,862
He fixed us.

1261
02:11:36,275 --> 02:11:38,402
Every one of us.

1262
02:11:40,312 --> 02:11:42,371
And I guess, in a way,

1263
02:11:43,949 --> 02:11:46,941
we kind of fixed each other too.

1264
02:17:59,791 --> 02:18:05,195
# If I had a million dollars #

1265
02:18:05,263 --> 02:18:09,563
# I know just what I would do #

1266
02:18:09,635 --> 02:18:14,402
# I'd tie a string
around the world #

1267
02:18:14,473 --> 02:18:18,807
# And bring all of it to you #

1268
02:18:20,312 --> 02:18:25,147
# Those little things
you pray for #

1269
02:18:25,217 --> 02:18:30,052
# Whatever they may be #

1270
02:18:30,122 --> 02:18:35,719
# I'd have enough
to pay for them all #

1271
02:18:35,794 --> 02:18:39,252
# C.O.D. #

1272
02:18:39,331 --> 02:18:44,325
# If I spent a million dollars #

1273
02:18:44,403 --> 02:18:48,635
# I know I would never care #

1274
02:18:48,707 --> 02:18:53,542
# Because as long
as you were mine #

1275
02:18:53,612 --> 02:18:58,242
# I'd still be a millionaire #

1276
02:18:59,518 --> 02:19:03,955
# That's why I'm always dreaming #

1277
02:19:04,022 --> 02:19:08,288
# Dreaming of what I would do #

1278
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:15,198
# If I had a million dollars #

1279
02:19:15,267 --> 02:19:21,604
# For you #
