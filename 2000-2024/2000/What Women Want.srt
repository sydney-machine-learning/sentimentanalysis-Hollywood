1
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,670
(WOMAN) You know the expression
"a man's man"?

2
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,220
A man's man is the leader
of the pack.

3
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,840
The kind of man
other men look up to,

4
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,800
admire and emulate.

5
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
A man's man
is the kind of man who...

6
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,730
just doesn't get
what women are about.

7
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,070
Nick, my ex-husband,
is the ultimate man's man.

8
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,150
I probably never
should have married him.

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,390
I don't think he understood
a thing about me.

10
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,530
This is Nick Marshall's office.
Do you want a peek?

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,740
Don't worry.
He never gets in before ten.

12
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,830
He'll send you on more errands
than anyone in the company.

13
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,650
He can't do anything for himself.

14
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,030
He's the least politically-correct
guy in the universe.

15
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,960
He's the king of all
the T and A ads that we do.

16
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,200
You want babes in bikinis,
he's your man.

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,910
My dad? How can I best describe him?

18
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,720
He's always been like an uncle to me.

19
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,180
Yeah. Uncle Dad.

20
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,840
Although Nick was a charmer.

21
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,130
Completely irresistible at first.

22
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,180
Which feeds into
the whole "Man's man" thing.

23
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,930
You know about Nick's mother, right?

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,810
Because once you understand
about Nick's mother,

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,700
you understand Nick.

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,660
(CHEERING)

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,790
Nick was actually born and raised
in Las Vegas.

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,160
Nick's mother was a real
honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl.

29
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,660
When other boys were outside
riding their bikes and playing ball,

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,160
Nick was backstage,
hanging with the girls.

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,160
He was their mascot.

32
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,930
Their little pet.

33
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,250
They couldn't get enough
of those baby blues.

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,230
If you ask me, Nick's mother
just about killed it

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,640
for every woman Nick
would ever meet.

36
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,140
She had a lot of sugar daddies
in her life,

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,640
but only one true love.

38
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,280
The boy with the family jewels.

39
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,740
17, 18, 19, 20...

40
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,120
And since Nick
didn't have a father,

41
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,080
his mom made sure
he was always surrounded

42
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,400
by strong male role models,

43
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,780
men her little boy
could really look up to.

44
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,050
Keep counting, kid.

45
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,750
There was nothing normal about
the way Nick Marshall was raised.

46
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,080
So what can you expect?

47
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,140
You don't have to be Freud

48
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,430
to figure out this was one
cock-eyed way to enter the world.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,460
Don't you ever knock?

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,670
It's almost ten. You gotta
go to work and I gotta vacuum.

51
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,510
And don't... Another one
who wears vanilla perfume!

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,220
Don't you know any women
who don't smell like candy?

53
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,470
Could you toss me my lighter, babe?

54
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,470
Babe? What am l, a little pig?

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,230
I don't have time to make
you no onion bagels,

56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,820
so please do not beg, OK?

57
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,400
And just for the record...

58
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,440
I don't like finding these things.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,440
What kind of woman wears this?

60
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,440
My mother wore underwear like that.
Just put them somewhere, babe.

61
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,570
"Babe" is going to put it in the trash,
so your mother can excuse me.

62
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,780
Do you ever consider dating a woman
that wears real underwear?

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,830
You know,
that covers the entire bottom?

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,960
No. If I do, shall I call you?

65
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,420
Ah!

66
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,660
I'm going to go clean the kitchen.

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,970
You couldn't toast me
a little bagel?

68
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,640
Cream cheese, tomatoes, capers?
Please?

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,430
- I can't think on an empty stomach.
- OK.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,760
But only because
you didn't call me little pig.

71
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,810
OK. You got it, babe.

72
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,060
Mr Marshall, how you doing today?

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,700
- Fit as a dancing bear.
- I'll get that cab for you.

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,350
(LOUD WHISTLE)
That's some set of pipes.

75
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,160
- You have an excellent day, sir.
- And you.

76
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,540
At ease.

77
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,930
Oh, I'm so sorry!

78
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,550
I absolutely did not mean to do that.
Let me get that for you.

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,350
- It's OK.
- No, I'm mortified.

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,720
I can see your hands are full.
Let me get the door for you.

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,650
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

82
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,690
Half cup, grande, non-f at,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

83
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,610
Half cup, grande, non-f at,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

84
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,350
- So when do you find out?
- Today, I think.

85
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,620
Unless I didn't get it
and then I will just never find out.

86
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,450
I didn't get it. They were
looking for an earth mother.

87
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,330
I overheard the director say
I was more space cadet.

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,990
I'm an actress.
I can be whatever you want.

89
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,540
Is that true? Can you?

90
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,490
It better be true or I'm stuck
playing ditsy coffee-shop girl.

91
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,090
Thanks.

92
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,670
Oh. Hi, Nick.

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,390
Hi.

94
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,590
Lola, my love, when are you going
to let me buy you dinner?

95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,380
Nick, I'm not your type.
Trust me on this one.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,550
Cappuccino, extra foam.
Tall or grande?

97
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,100
Grande.

98
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,760
- At least I like to think so.
- Next.

99
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,390
Rumour has it that I'm getting some
really big news at work today.

100
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,140
Why don't we celebrate?
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,900
Memo to you -
I work in a coffee shop.

102
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,530
Hi. What can I get you?

103
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,080
Do you want me to stop
asking you out?

104
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,620
This'll just take a sec.

105
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,660
If that's what you want,
give me the word and I'll stop.

106
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,670
Yes. I'm going to give you the word
because I'm an actress,

107
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,920
or at least trying to be one.
I'm trying to concentrate on that,

108
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,010
so it would be a good thing
if you wouldn't mind...

109
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,880
Stop asking me out.

110
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,460
You seem so stressed.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,010
I am stressed.
I have a lot on my plate.

112
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,020
Let's not talk now. Why don't
I meet you here tomorrow, say 10.30?

113
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,560
OK. That would be good.

114
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,800
- So it's a date?
- It's a date. Thank you.

115
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,650
Sir, that was inspiring.

116
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,190
I know.

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,610
Good morning. Sloane Curtis.

118
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,320
- Good morning, Mr Marshall.
- Hi. What's the dirt?

119
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,950
- I was at breakfast...
- Hey, Norm. You winning?

120
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,900
I heard Miller's shopping around,
looking for a new agency.

121
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,990
Miller Lite. I know. I'm all over it.

122
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,490
I heard Darcy McGuire left BBD & O.

123
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,790
- Morning, Angela.
- Left or was fired?

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,170
I don't know.
But everyone's thrilled.

125
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,960
Well. So much for edgy female vision.

126
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,340
So that girl we met last night
at the club?

127
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,890
Nothing happened
after you put her in the cab?

128
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,220
It did? Something happened?
She said she had to be in bed early.

129
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,140
I had her in bed by eleven.
Or was it a quarter to?

130
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,970
You are a genius. You know that?

131
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,220
What can I tell you? I'm blessed.

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,140
And today is my lucky day.

133
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,930
Not only is my ex-wife Gigi
remarrying, right about now,

134
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,780
but Wanamaker wants to see me
first thing. Called twice to confirm.

135
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,320
Call me when he makes it official.

136
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,280
It won't be so easy for you to suck
up to "Creative Director", you know.

137
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,410
I'll make us a lunch res to celebrate.

138
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,240
Don't count your chickens, huh?

139
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,830
One o'clock?

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,170
- Pick you up.
- Can I borrow this?

141
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,800
(SONG: "MACK THE KNIFE"
BY BOBBY DARIN)

142
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,970
Hey, Dina. Do you know the
difference between a wife and a job?

143
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,510
What is it?

144
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,430
After ten years, the job still sucks.

145
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,020
I wouldn't do that if I were you. No.

146
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,180
- Oh, Mr Marshall. Hi.
- Hey.

147
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,850
I put the Gillette storyboards
on your desk, picked up your shoes,

148
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,980
today's staff meeting was cancelled,
and I also got your cigarettes.

149
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,350
- The staff meeting was cancelled?
- That's what I was told.

150
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,820
Good morning, girls.

151
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,240
Good afternoon, sire.

152
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,370
Anybody know why the staff meeting
was cancelled?

153
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,960
Nobody called us.

154
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,490
But Mr Wanamaker wants to see you
as soon as you get in,

155
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,210
which I told his office
was 15 minutes ago.

156
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,760
I know.

157
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,420
You couldn't show up on time?
You're being promoted.

158
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,630
But you look very sharp.
Like a creative director.

159
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,310
Very distinguished.

160
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,480
Can you two handle yourselves
on the 44th floor?

161
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,940
Are you kidding?
We were made for the 44th floor.

162
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,020
Now get up there
so we can break out the bubbly.

163
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,480
- Don't wait up.
- Don't wait up!

164
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,230
- He's so adorable.
- The cutest thing!

165
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,870
I'm sorry. I was in the board meeting
that would never end.

166
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,030
- Been here long?
- A couple of minutes.

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,170
Jess, can I get a cup of decaff
and some Tylenols?

168
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,840
And Echinacea and some club soda.
I've got something on my tie.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,710
You know what?
Just get me another tie.

170
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,050
I saw the mock-ups you did for
Johnny Walker. They are fantastic.

171
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,720
That's my job, Dan.

172
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,350
You know I'm not great
at making speeches,

173
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,390
especially
when you don't write them!

174
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,420
So I'll do my best. I've been
in this racket over 30 years,

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,730
and let me tell you, it doesn't get
easier, it gets harder and harder.

176
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,390
The '80s were our glory days.

177
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,490
They were all about alcohol,
tobacco and cars.

178
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,070
I was on top of my game.

179
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,740
And then in the '90s,

180
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,110
men simply stopped dominating
how the dollars were spent,

181
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,160
and we lost our compass.

182
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,200
Women between the ages of 16 and 24

183
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,290
are the fastest-growing
consumer group in the country.

184
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,780
We're talking about girls born
in the mid-80s,

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,340
who control our advertising dollars.

186
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,380
Sorry. No Echinacea. Hi, Nick.

187
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,010
- Hey.
- Red or lavender?

188
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,880
Red. No... Lavender. That's good.

189
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,640
While we've been getting our rocks
off shooting beer commercials

190
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,220
with the Swedish bikini team,
the industry's been transformed.

191
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,140
We were the agency in town
ten years ago.

192
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,020
Now we're struggling to be third.

193
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,110
If we don't evolve, and think
beyond our natural ability,

194
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,730
we're going to go down.

195
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,600
"Think beyond our..."? I'm not
quite clear what you mean, Dan.

196
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,020
What do you know
about Darcy McGuire?

197
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,080
I heard she just left BBD & O.

198
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,280
I never met the woman,
but I hear she's a real man-eater.

199
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,910
She won that Cleo last year
for the ad about the...

200
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,960
Oh, yeah, right. That was her?
I forgot about that.

201
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,420
I wish I had. Oh, boy.
I hear she is a bitch on wheels.

202
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,050
That's very funny.

203
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,420
Yeah. Why?

204
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,330
Because I just hired her.

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,430
To do what?

206
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,140
You know I love you, Nick,

207
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,270
but it's a woman's world out there,

208
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,800
and getting into a woman's psyche
is not exactly your strong suit.

209
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,230
You can get into their pants better
than anybody, but not their psyche.

210
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,430
You hired Darcy McGuire to do what?

211
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,400
She hasn't done it on her own yet,
but somebody was going to grab her.

212
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,740
And she's smart, Nick.
She's very smart.

213
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,080
You made her Creative Director,
didn't you?

214
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm sorry, buddy, but I've got
the board breathing down my neck.

215
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,200
She's coming in today. You'll meet
her. Come on, roll with this.

216
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,220
Work with her. She's got what I need
to keep this place afloat.

217
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,180
She's got what you need
meaning she's a woman?

218
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,300
How can we compete with that?

219
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,810
He's coming. He's coming.

220
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,850
Not so fast, girls.

221
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,150
Put it on ice.

222
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,060
We'll break it out soon.

223
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
We're not moving to the 44th floor?

224
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,910
Not today.

225
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,080
- OK, Gigi. One more.
- Gigi, your ex is here.

226
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,830
Honey, you look
like 48 million dollars.

227
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,380
Thank you.

228
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,670
- May I kiss the bride?
- Sure.

229
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,210
- Nick.
- Nick!

230
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,390
Ted! Congratulations, Ted.
You're a lucky man.

231
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,470
Well, thanks. I happen to agree.

232
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,520
So you're going on a cruise.
Two weeks, huh?

233
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,440
The cruise is just the last week.
Alexandra has an itinerary.

234
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,280
I f axed one to your office,
one to your apartment,

235
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,690
Ted's office has one,
as does the school.

236
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,610
In case I f all off the planet?

237
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,240
You never know.

238
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,110
Hey, here she is. Pretty in pink.

239
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,000
Two whole weeks together, huh?

240
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,000
- How are you going to handle it?
- I'm going to love it.

241
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,340
You can take care of me.
Cook for me, get me my slippers.

242
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,250
Yeah, that'll be happening.

243
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,500
- Alexandra has a boyfriend now.
- Mom!

244
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,790
I'm telling him so he won't
be surprised when he comes by.

245
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,550
A boyfriend? You're only 13.

246
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,050
Am I? I thought I was 15.

247
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,350
We're gonna be fine.

248
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm going to meet Cameron. Is it OK
if I meet Dad back at his place?

249
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,400
- Is that all right with you?
- Yeah, well...

250
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,480
- What time?
- Eight? Nine, maybe?

251
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,610
- 7.30.
- OK.

252
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,150
Bye, Mom.

253
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,310
Oh, honey, I'm going to miss you.

254
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,780
I'm going to miss you too.
Ted, have a good time.

255
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,450
Bye, pumpkin.

256
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,160
- Nick.
- Honey?

257
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,790
Later.

258
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,450
7.30's fine. Thanks for asking.
And the name's Dad.

259
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,130
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

260
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,890
- I heard. I can't believe this.
- My next headache.

261
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,020
Don't worry. We'll get through it.

262
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,730
Everyone...

263
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,110
Everyone, meet Darcy McGuire.

264
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,020
(APPLAUSE)

265
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,610
(DARCY) Hi. Oh, my goodness.
Everybody showed up.

266
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,530
- Nice to see you.
- What a pleasant surprise.

267
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,730
- God what a small world!
- Welcome aboard.

268
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,650
I'm so glad to meet you.

269
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,500
Hello. I'm Darcy.

270
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,340
- Hi. I'm Nick Marshall.
- I've heard a lot about you, Nick.

271
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,880
I've heard a lot about you too,
Darcy.

272
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,590
Don't worry. Can't all be true.

273
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,390
Let's hope not.

274
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,180
Hey.

275
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,460
(DAN) Standing room only.
It's a first.

276
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,270
I'm very excited for you all
to meet Darcy McGuire.

277
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,820
I know Darcy's reputation as
a leader in the field precedes her.

278
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,070
At BBD & O,
Darcy led a creative team

279
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,200
that snagged $500 million
in new business wins,

280
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,910
and that was just last year.

281
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,990
Here at Sloane Curtis, we pride
ourselves on our strategic thinking.

282
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,870
Now it's time for us to step up

283
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,740
and prove ourselves creatively
in the marketplace.

284
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
I'm thrilled that Darcy has
consented to move across town,

285
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,210
join our team, and lead us
into the 21st century.

286
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,010
(APPLAUSE)

287
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,050
Thank you, Dan. And thank you all
for that warm welcome.

288
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,680
Let me start by saying
the feeling is mutual.

289
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,750
I am absolutely thrilled to be here.

290
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,940
When I first started, it was
my dream to work at Sloane Curtis.

291
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,560
In f act, I even applied
for a job here - twice.

292
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,190
Somebody call Personnel.

293
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,270
But it was BBD & O
that offered me a home.

294
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,160
What I learned there
was that any success I had

295
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,160
was a direct result of the team
that I worked with.

296
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,500
I know two heads are better
than one, five are better than two.

297
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,710
And I know that if we put our heads
and our hearts into this company,

298
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,780
we'll deliver. I know that.

299
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Now, I love challenges,
I love hard work.

300
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,370
I look forward to sitting
at this table, tossing ideas around

301
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,260
until, I fear, the wee hours
of the morning.

302
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,180
But, most importantly, I want
the work we do to say something

303
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,380
about who we are, how we think,
what we feel...

304
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,480
Excuse me.

305
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,770
So, as our friends in Hollywood say,
let's cut to the chase.

306
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,480
How are we going to turn
this company around?

307
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,400
When Sears decided to go after women
in their advertising

308
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,240
and said, "See the softer side of
Sears", their revenues went up 30%%%.

309
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,120
30%%%. That's huge.

310
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,700
Female driven advertising
totalled $40 billion last year,

311
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,420
and Sloane Curtis's
share of that was...?

312
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,130
Zero.

313
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,430
If you want to sell an anti-wrinkle
cream or a Ford Mustang to a woman,

314
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,840
forgive me, but this is the last
place you bring your business,

315
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,630
and we can't afford to not
have a piece of a $40 billion pie.

316
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,670
So I have put together
a little kit for everybody.

317
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,230
Nobody panic.
This is supposed to be fun.

318
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,440
Every product in this box is looking
for new representation right now.

319
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,110
And they're all made for women.

320
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm pretty sure all the women here
are familiar with these products,

321
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,530
so for the men,
let's briefly run through them.

322
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,200
Here you go, Nick.

323
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,500
Thank you.

324
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,500
Each kit contains
anti-wrinkle cream,

325
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,130
mascara, moisturising lipstick,
bath beads,

326
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,260
quick-dry nail polish,
an at-home waxing kit,

327
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,130
a "More wonderful" Wonderbra,
a home pregnancy test,

328
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,680
hair volumiser...

329
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,800
pore cleansing strips, Advil,

330
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,310
control-top pantyhose
and a Visa card.

331
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,900
Now, I want everybody
to come up with something.

332
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,150
For one product, for two,
the whole box. Whatever moves you.

333
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,150
We'll get together tomorrow
and see where we are.

334
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,820

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,890
Yes, sir.

512
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,030
Gr-rr-rr!

513
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,530
I think I'll walk today.
I could use fresh air.

514
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,690
You have a great day, sir.

515
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,790
With your fine ass
looking like Shaft!

516
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,360
Ooh! I could just ride that puppy!

517
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,710
Hey! Watch where you're going!

518
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,450
- Are you OK, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

519
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,220
(WOMAN) Did I turn
the coffee maker off?

520
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,060
Did I turn it off?
I can't remember.

521
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,810
I saw the light on, but did
I actually turn the switch off?

522
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,900
One kiss doesn't make me
a lesbian.

523
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,650
Does it?

524
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,570
Sorry.

525
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,860
Two slices of toast, 150 calories,
plus a pat and a half of butter...

526
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,730
So oestrogen is good for the heart
but bad for the breasts? What?

527
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,330
My kid doesn't need Ritalin...

528
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,500
-lf I get him to listen to me...
-Monsieur, I need to poop!

529
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,780
Oh, God! Oh, boy!

530
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,540
(CACOPHONY OF VOICES)

531
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,930
Oh, God, he nearly killed me.
Too bad he missed.

532
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,690
- Good morning.
- Good mor...

533
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,280
Don't look up. He'll make me hear
another disgusting joke.

534
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,820
He's such a schmuck.

535
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,410
She thinks that I'm a schmuck?

536
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,290
Whoa! Lighten up
on that aftershave, buddy.

537
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,500
What? Oh, yeah, like
you've got the perfect body?

538
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,130
Jesus.

539
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,010
- Hi, Mr Marshall.
- Don't say it.

540
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,720
What? The Gillette budget's
on your desk,

541
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,290
and I got you that Merlot you wanted.

542
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,300
Here's your credit card back.

543
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,930
Thank you.

544
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,430
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

545
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Do you realise I have
an Ivy League education,

546
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,060
and that running your errands
has put me into therapy?

547
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,560
Why don't you give me
some real work to do?

548
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,610
Oh, yeah, I remember why.
Because I have a vagina!

549
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,370
Is there anything else I can get?

550
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,620
Oh, good, you're on time.

551
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,530
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

552
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,700
What's the matter?
You look different.

553
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,630
I think it's his hair.
It looks a little thicker.

554
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,210
Give me your coat.

555
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,840
- You smell good today.
- New cologne?

556
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,180
That's it? No other thoughts?

557
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,890
- What do you mean?
- Are you feeling all right?

558
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,020
Linings, loans, locks...

559
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,600
Hello, Nick?

560
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,150
Ah, Nick?

561
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,610
We gotta go. What are you doing?
It's 8.30.

562
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,230
I can't go. Gotta find a doctor.
I need a cure. Can't go.

563
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,280
You sound like the guy from Shine.
What's wrong with you?

564
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,700
Maybe I need an exorcist.
Under X. No, under E.

565
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,000
There are no exorcists
in the Greater Chicago area, bud.

566
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,840
Let's pull it together and go sell
some sensitive feminine shit, OK?

567
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,870
Sorry to interrupt. Here you go.

568
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,800
By the way, your hair looks
really good today, Mr Marshall.

569
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,930
And it's OK you pay me
minimum wage

570
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,880
because I just called my boyfriend
in Israel - for an hour.

571
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,100
Tell me you heard that?

572
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,560
Your hair looks really good.
So what?

573
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,220
The what she was thinking thing.

574
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,270
I don't think she thinks too much.
She's not exactly a genius, pal.

575
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,610
- She went to an Ivy League school.
- I doubt that.

576
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,530
The thing she said about
the boyfriend, calling him in Israel.

577
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,660
I didn't hear it
because she didn't say it.

578
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:34,040
Let's pull it together. We're going
to be late for our sorority meeting.

579
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,000
Morgan...

580
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,780
In case I like, maybe, die today...

581
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,500
Can we walk and talk? In case you
live, I don't want to be late, OK?

582
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,380
Here's what happened,
in case the coroner asks.

583
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,750
I got drunk last night and tried
all the products from the box.

584
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,250
- You did not?
- I put on all the products.

585
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,260
Nail polish, pantyhose, everything.

586
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,480
- You tried on the pantyhose?
- Yes! OK?

587
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,680
I was drying my hair and I fell
over and fell into the bathtub,

588
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,440
electrocuted myself and blacked out.

589
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,780
When I woke up, I could hear what
every woman around me was thinking.

590
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,820
- Uh-huh.
- Personal, private stuff.

591
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,660
The stuff that nobody on earth
is supposed to hear.

592
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,580
You know what I'm saying?
I can hear what women think.

593
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,030
Can you? Good. That's not a talent
a lot of guys have these days.

594
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,750
You don't believe me?
You want me to prove it?

595
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,740
- See this attorney?
- Yeah.

596
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,130
She thinks you're overpaid...and gay.

597
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,670
What?

598
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,510
I can hear what they're all
thinking. Even French poodles!

599
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,040
Just so we are on the same page,
I need you to know you sound insane.

600
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,680
You're freaked out
over losing the job,

601
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,430
but if you tell anyone that you hear
the thoughts of a French poodle...

602
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,980
What if I jumped out the window?

603
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,230
Just put the fruit down
and jump through the glass.

604
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,100
Would they notice? Probably not
if I didn't get glass on anybody.

605
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,490
The girl with the fruit is kind
of funny -suicidal, but she's funny.

606
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,370
Nick, what girl with the fruit?

607
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,500
Last one to arrive. Wants me
to know I'm not his boss.

608
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,660
OK. You're a star.
I get the message.

609
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,280
She thinks I'm late because I want
her to know she's not my boss.

610
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,790
- What is she talking about?
- Put a lid on it.

611
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,300
I can't believe I have
butterflies in my stomach.

612
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,010
Feels like the first day of school.

613
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,760
OK. So let's see how we did.

614
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,130
Nobody wants to go first.

615
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:35,020
Everyone's avoiding me...
except Nick Marshall.

616
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,270
Unbelievable. The only one
with good eye contact.

617
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,310
At least he's looking in my eyes
and not down my blouse.

618
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,310
So, Nick, what did you come up with?

619
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,280
Me? What did I come up with?

620
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,660
He's so wired.

621
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,490
Mostly I thought about
the moisturising lipstick.

622
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,710
Never having worn lipstick myself.

623
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,670
I tried to imagine what I'd want
from a lipstick if I were a woman.

624
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,510
-Spare me!
- OK. He's trying to be honest.

625
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,250
You know, to be perfectly honest,

626
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,250
my first thought was a Tahitian
beauty bathing under a waterfall.

627
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,180
I'm going to die here
with these kinds of ideas.

628
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,720
But, you know, I'm working on it,
and it's evolving...

629
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,940
I don't suppose anybody's
interested in an idea

630
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,860
involving the Swedish bikini team?
I do know them all personally.

631
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,110
-Oh, what an idiot.
-Grow up already.

632
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,350
-What a pig.
-You are so foul.

633
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,030
I should have asked
for more money.

634
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,030
Dina?

635
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,040
I spent the night trying to figure
out how to sell Advil just to women.

636
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,920
You know what? We should
sell it to women like me.

637
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,460
I take it every time
I need to fake a headache.

638
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,840
Works like a charm.

639
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,930
I got a great one. Just came to me.
Mind if I interrupt, Dina?

640
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,830
No. Sure. Go ahead.

641
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,250
I hate that you've seen me naked.

642
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,880
All right. We're in a bedroom,
the lights are out.

643
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,020
There's a woman in bed
taking an Advil.

644
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,220
Her husband turns over
and suggestively rubs her back,

645
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,150
and we say, "Advil...

646
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,560
"so mild and gentle, you can take it
even when you're faking a headache."

647
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,950
And then the woman says,

648
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,790
"Not tonight, dear,
I need an Advil."

649
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,790
He's back.

650
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,250
What? Come on, that doesn't reach
women on a personal level?

651
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,830
- No.
- Women do that, don't they?

652
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,660
-Not me.
- I don't.

653
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,970
Sue Cranston? You've done that,
haven't you? Faked a headache?

654
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,390
No, Nick, I haven't.
Thanks for asking.

655
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,670
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Be honest now.

656
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,650
You've been married, what,
ten, twelve years?

657
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,110
And you've never faked a headache?
It doesn't work like a charm?

658
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,230
No, Nick, I haven't.

659
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,530
I mean, no, it doesn't, OK?

660
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,910
Jeez!
What an asshole!

661
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,320
OK. I guess I'm way off base here.

662
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,980
OK. What's good about your idea

663
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,410
is that you're looking at Advil
from a woman's point of view.

664
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,580
Um... I don't think Advil
will go for it,

665
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,460
and I'm pretty sure every woman
in America will hate it,

666
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,620
but other than that,
I thought it was great.

667
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,670
You're on the right track. Go ahead.

668
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,880
Great antenna there, babe.

669
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,010
Did the poodle give you that one?

670
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,990
- Dad, why are you home so early?
- I have my first migraine.

671
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,910
This is hideous. My boyfriend
feeling me up in front of my father!

672
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,110
Alex, just don't think anything.
"The outlook wasn't good..."

673
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,870
Oh, shit! Where's my bra?

674
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,460

00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,300
Why don't you step on my hands...?

846
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,880
- Here you go.
- Oh.

847
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,670
How are you doing?

848
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,510
Oh, fine. Thank you, Mr Marshall.

849
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,050
You're welcome...er?

850
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,600
- Erin.
- Erin.

851
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,970
You be careful, all right, Erin?

852
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,640
Yeah. Sure.

853
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,770
Heavy.

854
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,860
What do you know?
There is life on this planet.

855
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:44,490
(DARCY) Breakfast on Tuesday
sounds great. Absolutely.

856
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,740
Thanks for the info,
and thanks for the champagne.

857
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,210
You too. OK. Bye-bye.

858
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,090
Set meeting. Nike.
Women's division.

859
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,670
- Hi.
- Hi. Well...

860
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,720
Looks like you've been here a year.

861
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,800
Yeah. I'm compulsive.
It's a problem.

862
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,720
Why do I always feel
he's checking me out?

863
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,230
I wonder what he's got
up his sleeve.

864
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,050
Great photographs.

865
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,860
No clue they're
Margaret Bourke White.

866
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,820
They're not all
Margaret Bourke White, are they?

867
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,640
Yeah, they are.

868
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,780
Wow. It's a beautiful collection.

869
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,440
Thanks. So how's it going?

870
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,660
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

871
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,150
It's starting slow.

872
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,120
I'm evaluating some of the staff
and that's always hard.

873
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,110
Yeah. Right.

874
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,920
I don't want to beat around the bush,
so what I'd like to propose...

875
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,890
He's proposing so soon?

876
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:58,560
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry. Ah, yes.

877
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,520
- Excuse me. You got another one.
- Thanks.

878
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,060
Wow!

879
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,590
As I was saying,
I know nothing whatsoever

880
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,440
about the products
that you're going for personally,

881
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,820
but I do believe
I can sell anything

882
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,980
once I know the buyer's needs.

883
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,070
What I'd really like,
with your kind indulgence, of course,

884
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,400
is to go after that really big fish.

885
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:23,530
I mean, the one your really want
to land. I will reel them in for us.

886
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,580
No, actually,
I will reel them in for us.

887
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,580
Unless you're going
after something yourself.

888
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,590
No, no. It's just there are several
big fish out there.

889
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,880
Yeah? What's your biggest fish?

890
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,840
I mean, who's your whale?

891
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,500
Um...Nike? Women's division?

892
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,830
You heard they were shopping?

893
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,920
I got wind of it.

894
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,970
That's amazing. I heard no one knew.

895
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,220
- You knew.
- I heard no one else knew.

896
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,010
It's OK if I know what you know.
I mean, we're on the same team now.

897
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,150
Besides, I heard someone say
two heads were better than one.

898
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,680
- Oh, you were listening?
- More than you know.

899
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,350
OK. Here is what I heard.

900
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,070
Nike is shopping - quietly.

901
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,870
But if they make a change,
it's going to happen fast.

902
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,360
You know this is a tough one
for us to get.

903
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,780
It would be tough for anybody,
but if we got it...

904
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,960
-that's all we'd need.
- I hear you.

905
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,280
So what do they want exactly?

906
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,420
They want to empower women.

907
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,880
- What?
- Well... I'm sorry, I...

908
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:29,250
- That won't work.
- I'm sorry. I understand. Go on.

909
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,670
They want
to get inside women's heads

910
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,060
and reach them on a very real level.

911
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,770
Don't take this the wrong way,

912
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,310
but you got jumpy talking
about a lipstick.

913
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,060
Nike is state-of-the-art,
hardcore woman power.

914
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,610
Are you sure you want this one?

915
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,740
You get them here in two weeks,
I'll be ready.

916
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,700
This guy is kind of exciting.

917
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,820
Hey! Glad I caught you both.

918
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,530
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

919
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,870
I want you to look at these boards
for US Air before they come by.

920
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,530
- Right.
- It seems like something's missing.

921
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,700
Hmm. I don't like the graphics.

922
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,500
Feels a bit parochial.

923
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,160
Maybe it should be
in black and white.

924
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,710
What do you think, Nick?

925
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,050
I don't know who you've had working
on these, Dan, but...

926
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,430
it seems kind of - what's the word? -

927
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,960
parochial to me.
What do you think, Darcy?

928
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,140
I totally agree.
Especially about the graphics.

929
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,560
They're parochial.
It's so funny you just said that.

930
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,310
Why don't you get them to try it in
black and white. Might punch it up.

931
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,220
What? Did you say something?

932
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,850
No. I just swear I was thinking
the exact same thing.

933
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,740
Were you?

934
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:46,530
Black and white could really help.
Good idea, Nick.

935
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,370
Good idea, Nick! Quick,
say something before he leaves.

936
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,920
- Dan?
- Yeah?

937
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,420
If you want me to have another look
at the boards, give me a buzz.

938
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,580
- I will. Thanks, buddy.
- Dan?

939
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,430
In case they find Nick's idea
too retro, which they might.

940
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,050
They may hear elegant
and think it's old fashioned.

941
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,390
I'd be ready with maybe
a dot com kind of thing.

942
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,880
Maybe there's something
about getting online

943
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,350
and being online at the airport...

944
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,690
I think we're fine. We're good.
I like Nick's fix on this.

945
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,230
Great.

946
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,690
Do you want to come by later?
I got a box of Cubans.

947
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,280
- Great.
- Cool.

948
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,610
You smoke cigars?

949
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,740
No.

950
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,940
Your office is looking
really snazzy. I love the red.

951
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,490
- Thanks.
- Me, too.

952
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,650
Mr Marshall,
your daughter on line one.

953
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,670
- I'm sorry, would you mind if...?
- Here you go.

954
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,040
He has a daughter?
I didn't picture that. How old?

955
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,590
She's 15. She's staying with me
while her mom's away.

956
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,410
He's married?

957
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,620
Away on her honeymoon. Alex, hi.

958
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,010
Uh-huh. Sure, honey.
No, that's great.

959
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,300
Honey?
Who are you trying to impress?

960
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,710
I'm going out
with my friends after school.

961
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,300
Can I bring them back to your place?

962
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,730
No problem. Whatever you want.
What time are you going to be home?

963
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,640
Wait for me. I gotta go.

964
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:08,930
Eight's fine. I love you too.
Bye, sweetie.

965
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,390
Total shocker.
He's like a nice guy.

966
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,940
- Sorry. Duty calls.
- No. Of course.

967
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,160
- She's 15?
- Yeah.

968
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,790
She's got a boyfriend who's 18.

969
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,030
- And you hate that, right?
- Oh, hate it.

970
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,420
But she digs him and he's invited
her to the prom. That's a big deal.

971
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,840
Going to the prom is mostly
about the dress. You know that?

972
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,380
- Is it?
- Oh, yeah.

973
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,580
Once you got the dress handled,
it's all downhill.

974
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,460
This feels like a date. Why did
I go into all that? He needs to go.

975
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,140
Well, I'm outta here.

976
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,100
Do some research downtown.
Get inside women's heads.

977
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,640
If you need any help...

978
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,050
- Oh, I'll be picking your brain.
- You got it.

979
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,890
I'll take it.

980
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,690
Oh, candy. She won't last a month.

981
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,390
You can't wear that if you have hips.

982
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,320
- That one's cute.
- I can't wear low cut.

983
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,650
- (NICK) Alex?
- It's open.

984
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:09,070
What? Say something.

985
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,920
Ah... Hi. I'm Alex's dad, Nick.

986
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,990
- Hi.
- Hi.

987
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:18,050
-Deadbeat.
-Mr No-food-in-the-house.

988
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:21,720
-Forgot her birthday.
-Why is he just standing there?

989
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,050
Oh, I just wanted to let you know
that I was home.

990
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,270
I've got a date tonight, so I'm
going out, but I'll be home early.

991
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,550
Why don't you order a pizza?
There's no food in the joint.

992
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:37,400
I also wanted to know if you and I
could go on a date soon.

993
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,890
I'd like to take you shopping
for a prom dress.

994
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,220
Oh, that is so sweet.

995
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,150
I wish my dad would do something
like that. Oh, I love him.

996
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,060
First you throw Cameron out, now you
want me to go to the prom with him?

997
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,860
Well, I overreacted and I just
want to make up for it

998
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,410
by taking you shopping.

999
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,120
I mean, it's a pretty important
thing, you know.

1000
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:01,030
It's all downhill after the dress.

1001
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,840
He must be stoned. Fine.

1002
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,790
I'll get the most expensive dress,
shoes, make-up. He can afford it.

1003
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,300
What the hell, let's go crazy
while we're at it.

1004
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:14,470
We'll get you new make-up, shoes,
the works. What do you say?

1005
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,140
Fine. Whatever.

1006
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,340
That would mean yes, yes?

1007
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,420
Yes.

1008
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,970
Great. Well, nice to have met
you two. Hope to see you again soon.

1009
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,730
- Definitely.
- Bye, Mr Marshall.

1010
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,810
- Love the apartment.
- Great view.

1011
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,490
Thank you. OK.

1012
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:48,210
I gotta tell you, I'm not usually
like this on a first date.

1013
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,590
It's just that you've been
so amazing.

1014
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,200
You've been so sensitive,
so understanding and...

1015
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,300
- Do you want to come up?
- Oh, yeah.

1016
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,260
Am I ready for him to come up?

1017
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,800
If I sleep with him, he'll think
I'm a slut and never call me,

1018
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,600
or call me because he'll think
he can get it whenever he wants.

1019
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:14,190
Oh, what's the difference?
He's so incredible.

1020
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,430
He reminds me of my sister.

1021
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,030
So, what do you think?

1022
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:22,310
Lola, I will only come up
if you really want me to.

1023
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,200
I don't want you to do anything
you're not ready for.

1024
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,870
I can wait.

1025
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,870
Wow, he's got a great body...

1026
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,670
but whoa!

1027
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,200
What's with the tongue? I'm going
to need the Heimlich manoeuvre.

1028
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,750

Oh...

1033
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,560
OK. Lied about the grande...

1034
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:59,100
Aah! Would you mind if we had
the lights on, maybe?

1035
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,730
You don't want the light on?

1036
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,860
- Yeah, it might help.
- OK. If it'll help.

1037
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,600
God, I hope he's better
with the light on.

1038
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:12,830
He's so all over the place.
Just do it so I can start faking it.

1041
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,700
Yeah. I'm fine. Fine.

1042

1043
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,520
All right. Let's pull this together,
buddy.

1044

- Yeah.

1047
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,950
I can do this better.

01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,330

Why?

1111
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,740
Because objects may appear larger
than they actually are.

thing we were talking about before?

ignore you all night,

I wouldn't put up with that.

I mean, you're either interesting
or you're not.

1120

Can I write that down?

1122
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,110
I'm either interesting or I'm not.
He'll shit a brick.

1123
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:54,320
What if he says I'm not?

1124
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,480
He won't say that you're not.

1125
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,040
Trust me.

1126
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,500
OK. I did it.

1127
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:06,240

I wasn't moving to Israel.

Yeah. Good. And?

1129
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,950
I said what you said.
He can be a writer anywhere,

1130
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,250
but if I'm going to be in advertising,
I need to be here.

1131
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:18,050
- And then he said?
- I don't know. It was in Hebrew.

1132
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,340
But I don't think it was,
"You got it. See you next Tuesday".

1133
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,230
I'd wait it out. He'll call you.

1134
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,600
I can't. I'd better call him back.

1135
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:29,860
Be strong. He will call you.

1136
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,770
Well, girls, it's been nice chatting.
I gotta get back to work.

- Wait!
- Don't you want some coffee?

Oh, no, I'm cool.

1139
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:41,450
Really.

1140
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,910
But thank you anyway.

than I would have thought.

01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,620
This line doesn't feel exactly right.

1145
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,160
If you're thinking that line isn't
perfect, I agree. It needs work.

1146
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,640
There's something
not exactly right about it.

1147
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,310
I mean, it's not bad.
It's insightful, actually, it's just...

1148
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,890
What do you think
this woman's thinking?

1149
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,100
Ah, well...

1150
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,940
Let's see.

1151
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,390
She's thinking about
what she wants out of life.

1152
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:23,850
What's she going to accomplish?
How's she going to do all that?

1153
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:26,440
Women think about that a lot.

1154
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:30,150
Surprisingly a lot. They worry
all the time, about everything.

1155
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,120
You're so right.
How do you know that?

1156
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,370
Well, even I had a mother.

1157
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:42,090
Well, so maybe running
gives her time off from all of that.

1158
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:46,120
It gives her something she can't
get any place else. Look at her.

1159
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:50,170
God, I want to be her.
She looks so free, doesn't she?

1160
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,220
No one's judging her.
No boss to worry about.

1161
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,060
No guys to worry about.
No games to figure...

1162
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,710
I like that. No games. That's good.

1163
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,480
That'd be nice in life, wouldn't it?

1164
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,060
OK. Can I just think for one second?

1165
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:05,940
- Take your time.
- OK.

1166
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,860
OK.

1167
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,820
No games.

1168
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:13,070
How do I get that in?
She's running. It's early.

1169
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,320
It's quiet. Just the sound
of her feet on the asphalt.

1170
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,820
She likes to run alone.
No pressure. No stress.

1171
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,110
This is the one place
she can be herself.

1172
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,380
Look any way she wants.
Think any way she wants

1173
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,420
No game playing. No rules.

1174

playing games versus playing...

Playing by the rules,
playing games versus playing...

1177
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,170
- Why are you nodding?
- I think you're on to something.

1178
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,930
- Am I?
- Aren't you?

1179
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,480
Well, I was thinking
about a play on words.

1180
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,890
Something about games versus...

1181
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,310
I feel like I was
on to something good.

1182
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,470
- Playing games versus playing...
- Sports?

1183
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,980
Yes! Thank you.
Do you like any of this?

1184
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,490
A lot. I like the idea
that you can be yourself on the road.

1185
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,230
I do too. Did I say that out loud?

1186
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,120
No, I was just...

1187
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,200
I was circling around the exact
same thing, which is great -

1188
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,000
that we're both on the same...

1189
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,620
Sorry. I'm not thinking straight.
My glands may be swollen.

1190
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:18,990
You're doing great!
"Nike. No games..."

1191
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,630
"Just sports."

1192
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,660
All right. We should write that down.

1193
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,380
All right.

1194
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,220
Did he come up with that or did I?

1195
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,020
Can I be...?

1196
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,770
What?

1197
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:40,300
Ah... Well, can I be honest with you?

1198
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,650
Please do.

1199
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:46,520
Before I came here, I heard
you were a tough chauvinistic prick.

1200
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,690
I didn't know you meant that honest.

1201
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,240
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

1202
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,950
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's OK.

1203
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,240
You must have looked forward
to meeting me.

1204
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:57,750
I was dreading it. I had this
whole other person in my mind.

1205
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:01,610
Well, since we're sharing,
I heard a few things about you too.

1206
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:06,250
Oh, yes. I'm the "Man-eating bitch
Darth Vader of the ad world"?

1207
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,170
- Verbatim.
- Really?

1208
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,160
All right. Well, nice to meet you.

1209
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,420
But that's not who I am at all.

1210
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,350
Just for the record.

1211
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,010
I don't think that's who you are.

1212
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:23,140
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1213
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,480
You see, no games
equals embarrassing moment.

1214
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:33,400
Don't fall for a guy at work.
Don't fall for a guy at work.

1215
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,110
Don't fall for a guy at work.

1216
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,990
- Why?
- Why what?

1217
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,080
Why...why don't I just work
on these storyboards

1218
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,000
and bring them round to you tomorrow
if you're free?

1219
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,150
I'm free. Just call me any time.

1220
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:47,960
I'm flirting!
What's wrong with me?

1221
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,530
Oh, God! I just looked
at his penis!

1222
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,420
Oh, I hope he didn't see me.

1223
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,700
Oh, shit! I just looked
at it again! Stop it!

1224
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:59,870
- Are you all right?
- Fine. I got something in my eye.

1225
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,510
All right. Um, so, great.

1226
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,710
So tomorrow will be...
That'll be great. I'll see you then.

1227
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:09,170
- Good work, by the way.
- You too.

1228
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,680
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

Yeah.

1236
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:30,340
Good. I didn't think
anyone else was still here.

1237
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,880
I didn't know anyone was here.

1238
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,540
- What time is it?
- It's after ten.

1239
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,920
- I didn't realise it was so late.
-I feel so alone.

1240
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,020
I...I didn't catch that. Sorry.

1241
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,980
I didn't realise how late it was.

1242
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,810
I'm glad you're here.
I'm stuck. I feel so alone.

1243
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,640
Want me to give you a hand
with this?

1244
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,360
No, thanks. I'm OK.

1245
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,650
Yeah? I'm not buying it.
What's going on?

1246
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:55,820
Well, I have an early meeting
tomorrow with Dan.

1247
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:59,100
I wanted to make it later
so I could be more prepared,

1248
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,530
but you slipped in and took
the only time he had left,

1249
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,160
which left me with 8.15
tomorrow morning.

1250
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,240
I'm not as ready as I wish I was.

1251
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:10,330
- Sorry.
- You didn't do it on purpose.

1252
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,740
I just don't want him
to be disappointed.

1253
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,080
Why don't we
go through these together?

1254
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,410
- Really?
- I insist.

1255
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,500
Unless you're too tired.

1256
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,350
- No. I'm not tired.
- I can see that.

1257
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,270
It's just so far beyond tired
at this point.

1258
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,520
I basically stopped sleeping
ever since I took this job.

1259
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:35,190
- You have?
- Yeah.

1260
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,820
It's weird...
How do I say this?

1261
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,990
You don't feel
quite like yourself here?

1262
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,740
No, I don't.

1263
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,780
Not yet, anyway.

1264
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:46,950
Boy.

1265
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,000
Plus I'm mad that I'm getting sick.
I never ever get sick.

1266
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,960
In f act, you don't have
to sit so close to me.

1267
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,540
I'll brave it.

1268
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:00,210
So where do we kick off?
Control-top pantyhose?

1269
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,550
- OK.
- Personally, I think they work.

1270
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:06,420
You've worn control-top pantyhose?

1271
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,340
Did you put a pair in the pink box?

1272
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,720
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

1273
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:15,970
- You are full of surprises.
- Yeah.

1274
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,550
No. I mean that
as a compliment. I love that.

1275
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:22,650
- And how did you look in them?
- Ooh, hot.

1276
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,650
My daughter and her boyfriend
walked in and I had them on.

1277
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,740
And they said what when
they saw you in your pantyhose?

1278
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:34,870
I think it was the Wonderbra
they noticed first,

1279
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,360
and the nail polish -
fingers and toes...

# Why not use your mentality?
Wake up to reality

1281

just the thought of you

1282
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:51,160
# Makes me stop just before I begin

1283
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:54,760

01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,130
(ALEX) The dress you picked
is totally hideous.

1285
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,550
- I'm not coming out.
- It can't be that bad.

1286
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:08,560
I look like a nun. An ugly nun.

1287
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,440
Because it's grey?
Grey is the new black.

1288
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:17,770
If he says he likes it, I'll die.

1289
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,490
OK. Next.

1290
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,810
This, I love.

1291
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,870
Thank you. Next.

Alex, I want to talk to you about
something that's pretty important.

1323
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:25,380
I've never talked to you
about this before but...

1324
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,340
Oh, God. He's going to try to
be a dad. This should be hilarious.

1325
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,430

- Yeah, sure.

That doesn't mean I don't have
the right to talk to you about...

1329
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,290
- About?
- All right.

1330
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:47,990
You're a young woman now,

1331
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:52,370
and you may be flirting
with the idea of...of...

1332

Having sex?
Can I get a lemonade, please?

1333
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,380
Well, boys and girls
think very differently about sex.

1334
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:05,040
My hunch is that girls want guys
to like them and hang out with them.

1335
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:09,350
Whereas guys... And not all guys,
right, but most guys...

1336
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:12,060
they pretty much
just want to have sex.

1337
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:16,470
OK. What I'm trying to say here is,

1338
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:20,480
I don't want you to feel pressured
because your boyfriend's older.

1339
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,020
Please. Save it.

1340
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,650
Mom had this talk with me

1341

to have sex when it's special.

1342
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,120
I know everything.
And Mom knows me for real,

1343

and knows Cameron,

01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:35,690
so let's leave the parental talks
up to her.

1345
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:38,710
Plus I promised Cameron
I'd do it prom night.

1346
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:42,460
And let's not make me part
of this Nick makeover,

1347
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:44,170
or whatever this new thing is, OK?

1348
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:47,010
- What new thing?
- What new thing?!

1349
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:49,410
This ridiculous new guy
you're trying to be.

Clowning around with me.

1351
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:55,010
Asking if we can make a salad
together, watch Friends together.

1352
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,140
I mean, it's nuts
after 15 years of no relating.

1353
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:02,630
I mean, come on. Who are you
to talk about relationships anyway?

1354
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:06,810
You never had a real relationship
with anyone in your entire life.

1355
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,980
Look, I'm supposed
to meet my friends,

1356
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:13,400
- so I'm going to go, OK?
- Sure.

1357
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,450
Thanks for the dress.

1358
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:22,230
She didn't even finish her lunch.
Giving her advice?

1359
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,290
-Teenagers.
-I think the talk worked.

1360
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,000
-She's totally right.
-Move on, dude, it's over.

1361
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,790
Ah, please.

1362
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,630
Now you've seen
how the cake is assembled,

1363
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,260
the next time you admire
a wedding cake

1364
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,300
you can appreciate
its architecture...

1365
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:42,100
That's so gorgeous.

1366
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,840
Fit, vibrant, hair...

1367
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,980
I always hated being overweight.

1368
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,980
I wanted to be thin, pretty,
wear cute clothes.

1369
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:56,150
It built and built
and my health deteriorated.

1370
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,900
I couldn't walk or stand.

1371
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:01,400
Couldn't even stand up at the park
for 10 minutes while my kids played.

1372
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:05,190
I tried sitting on the swings,
but the chains cut into my hips.

1373
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:07,610
And I couldn't run,
and I couldn't move.

1374
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,330
I was tired and I wanted
to be a good mom...

1375
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,870
I couldn't go on living that way.

1376
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,360

(DARCY) What am I doing?

1379
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,170
Darcy?

1380
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,180
How did you know it was me?
I didn't say anything.

1381
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:28,800
I just sensed it.

1382
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,210
Shit! Idiot!
I didn't think he'd be there.

1383
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:34,760
- Excuse me?
- I didn't mean to really call you.

1384
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:38,890
I had your number here
and I was thinking of you.

1385
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,800
Thinking of calling you.

1386
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,770
Obviously I did call you.

1387
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,940
Oh, no, that's all right. I...er...

1388
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,240
I was thinking about you too.

Here's to another great idea.

1392
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:14,040
You mean, let's meet for a drink?

1393
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,970
Yes. That's exactly
what I wanted to say.

1394
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,020
Sometimes I think
you're a bit of a mind reader.

1395
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,340
But I don't have
to be a mind reader with you.

1396
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,310
- You always say what you think.
- I know. It's a curse.

1397
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,070
Are you kidding?
It's a relief. An enormous relief.

1398
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:33,030
Do you know how rare that is?
To say what you think.

1399
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:37,320
Do you know how rare it is
for someone to like that about me?

1400
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:40,910
Trust me, this has not been
a great thing in my life.

My ex-husband didn't love me,
let's put it that way.

1402

He didn't love you?

1403
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,660
Did I just say that?

1404
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,210
Oh, God!

1405
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,710
I meant to say "it".
He didn't love it.

1406
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,590
That I spoke my mind.

1407
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:02,380
If you want the truth, I'm not sure
he ever did really love me.

1408

- Oh.
- There's a conversation starter!

1409
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,890
God, a smart person
would just get so very drunk now.

1410
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,430
How long were you married?

1411
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,300
A little less than a year. I've been
divorced about nine months.

1412
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,070
We worked together. You know that?

1413
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:19,890
Yeah. I heard that.

1414
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:23,060
What was that like?

1415
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,200
It was great in the beginning.

1416
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:29,570
Then it changed, became competitive.

1417
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:33,610
Suddenly, the better I did,
the worse we did.

I know that now. No...

Truly. No, no. It's true.

1420
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,290
Do you want to know all this?

1421
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,970
Keep going.

1422
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:54,590
That's why I needed to get out
there on my own - scary as it was.

1423
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:57,380
I mean, not scary, but um...

1424
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:01,600
Well, yeah, I was kind of scared.

1425
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,190
Why?

1426
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,860
I don't know.

1427
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,650
Guess I wasn't sure
I could do the job.

1428
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:09,700
I mean, I thought I could do it,

1429
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:12,900
but I'm finding Sloane Curtis

1430
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:16,110
than I thought. I'm sorry.

1431
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,950
This is insensitive of me.
I know you were up for my job.

1432
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,200
I'm sorry I'm the one that got it.

1433
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:24,200
I'm not. I'm not.

1434
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,200
I've learned a lot from you.

1435
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,840
Like what?

1436
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,460
Well, for starters,
you really love what you do.

1437
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,960
- You really love what you do.
- Not as much as you.

1438
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:36,830
Don't say that. You're so great
at it. So great at it.

1439
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,810
I think Dan's even wondering
why he hired me.

1440
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:44,230
Really. I think the bloom
is definitely off the rose.

1441
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,150
Want to hear something great?

1442
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:50,690
Yeah.

1443
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:53,820
I just closed escrow
on my first apartment ever.

1444
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,480
Finally, I own my own place.

1445
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:02,740
What? Now I wish
I was a mind reader.

1446
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:11,280
I was just thinking...how men
like me can get so screwed up.

1447
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,800
I don't think there are men like you.

1448
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,550
If we kissed,
would it ruin everything?

01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:30,600
you're one of the great women.
I really do...

1452
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,860
I'm sorry.

1453
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,320
I just meant to say thank you.

1454
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,030
I'm so sorry.

01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,690

1456
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,930
in three and a half hours!

1457
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:35,070
Nick, may I just say that you are
an exceptionally great kisser.

1458
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:39,200
No. I mean really, really great.

1459
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:43,240
I haven't had this much fun
making out since...

1460
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,420
I've never had this much fun
making out.

1461
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:50,960
Me either.

We've nothing
to be embarrassed about.

1464
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,390
We made out.

1465
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:01,470
You and I made out.

1466
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,890
And if I may, it was...

1467
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:06,480
Sexy as hell.

1468
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:10,150
God, that's just
what I was about to say.

1469
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:13,070
Oh, I think I said it first.
I think.

1470
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,820
No, you did.

1471
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,700
Well, all right.

1472
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,370
Oh, I'm a grown woman.
Just say it.

1473
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:32,960

to my place? Say it.

Here he comes. OK.

01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:35,850
Lola?

1482
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,720
I know I haven't heard from you.

1483
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,630
How long have you been out here?

1484
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:43,190
Just a few hours.

1485
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:46,190
Nick, you said
that you wouldn't hurt me.

1486
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:49,780
And then you slept with me, and then
you didn't call me for six days.

1487
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:52,320
In the world of "Me", that's torture.

1488
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:56,950
I mean, we have this totally
unbelievable life-altering sex

1489
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,860
and then you just disappear!

1490
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:00,830
You stopped drinking coffee!

1491
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,830
Lola, I'm so sorry.

1492
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,370
It's OK.

1493
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,580
It's OK because I figured out
your little secret.

1494
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,040
- You did?
- It's so obvious.

1495
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,290
How else would you know
the things you know?

1496
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,450
It wasn't obvious to anybody else.

1497
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:17,010
Nick, come on.

1498
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,920
You're so sensitive.

1499
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:21,890
You're so aware of my feelings.
You're so tuned in.

1500
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:26,060
You talk to me like a woman,
you think like a woman.

1501
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,930
Nick, admit it.
You're totally and completely gay.

01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,060
I am?

1503
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,680
You're not? If you're not,
you've got to tell me.

1504
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:38,320
Tell me, because
based on the other night...

1505
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:41,770
Just put me out of my misery.
Are you or aren't you?

1506
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,660
Say you're gay, then I'm not nuts,

1507
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,370
not undesirable,
not rejected by another guy.

1508
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:48,860
-Just say it! Admit it!
- OK.

1509
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,090
I'm gay.

1510
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,130
How gay?

Oh... I'm as gay as it gets.

1512
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,090
You'll make some guy very happy
some day.

1513
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:15,920
Oh, from your lips.

1514
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,560
God, I hate that I'm crying.

1515
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:23,530
Well, look...

1516
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,030
if things should ever change
in that department...

1517
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,490
- You'll be the first to know.
- You promise?

1518
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:32,280
Oh, yeah. I promise. Come here.

1519
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,170
Oh, boy.

1520
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,420
It was very nice to meet you, Nick.

1521
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,750
- And you.
- Thanks for pip talk, yes?

1522
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:01,420
You two just take care
of each other.

1523
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,770
- Thanks for the yarmulka.
- No problem. You wear it well, yes?

1524
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,520
Happy trails, kids.

1525
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:09,190
Darcy!

1526
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:13,650
I need to talk to you.

1527
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:17,520
Oh, look at him. I knew it.
He is weird about it.

1528
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:21,740
This is not about last night.
It's about the Nike meeting.

1529
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:26,040
I honestly believe in my gut that you
should make the pitch to them.

1530
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:28,750
God. I guilted you
into this last night, didn't I?

1531
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,910
No. It would just be better
if you did it.

1532
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,130
No, no. This is your baby.

1533
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,450
I've got to go meet these folks.
See you in there.

1534
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,960
It's not my baby.

1535
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,760
Yes, it is.

1536
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,890
I predict no one will know I'm gone
until the files start to build.

1537
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,300
It could be days.

1538
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,680
Then someone will finally ask,

1539
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:58,140
"Where's the geek in the glasses
who carries all the files?"

1540
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:06,230
Do either of you know the story
on this Erin girl?

1541
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,650
Miss Lonely Hearts? Who knows?

1542
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:11,070
I know. She's been here two years.

1543
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,570
She tried to be a copywriter
but got turned down,

1544
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,120
so she's a messenger.

1545
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,780
- What fool turned her down?
- You did, sire.

1546
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,550
Well, did I ever meet with her
at least?

1547
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:25,800
I don't think so. As I recall,
you told me to "Blow her off".

1548
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:30,050
Well, I want to meet with her now.
The kid's got something kinda funny.

1549
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,760
This is your lucky day, pal.

1550
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:36,230
I saw the Nike group. All women.
Your specialty. I'll walk you up.

1551
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:38,300
I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.

1552
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,550
I'm going to write her a long letter.

1553
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:42,110
You're doing Darcy? Since when?

1554
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:45,780
No. I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.
Men are stupider. It's true.

1555
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,490
- Would you stop it?
- They are.

1556
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:49,810
"They"? Are you officially
a woman now?

1557
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:53,520
I wish. A woman wouldn't have
screwed over the woman she loved.

1558
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:56,730
And you know this whole thing
about penis envy?

1559
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,290
- Yeah.
- Not true.

1560
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,950
They don't envy.
Half of them don't even like it!

1561
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,750
You know who has penis envy? We do.

1562
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,910
That's why we cheat and screw up.

1563
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,160
We're obsessed
with our own equipment.

1564
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,630
- Are you ready?
- Yup. Thanks.

1565
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:15,970
(NICK) You don't stand in front
of a mirror before a run

1566
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:19,420
and wonder what the road
will think of your outfit.

1567
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,270
You don't have to listen to its
jokes and pretend they're funny

1568
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,850
in order to run on it.

1569
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:28,150
It would not be easier to run
if you dressed sexier.

1570
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:31,230
The road doesn't notice
if you're not wearing lipstick.

1571
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,640
Does not care how old you are.

1572
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,560
You do not feel uncomfortable

1573
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,640
because you make more money
than the road.

1574
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:41,830
And you can call on the road
whenever you feel like it.

1575
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:46,450
Whether it's been a day, or a couple
of hours since your last date.

1576
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:53,250
The only thing the road cares about
is that you visit once in a while.

1577
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,550
Nike.

1578
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:58,970
No games. Just sports.

1579
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,800
-He nailed it.
-They hit a home run.

1580
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:08,270

Why are you not the happiest guy
in Chicago right now? You did great.

1594
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:02,800
No, I didn't do so great.
We did so...

1595
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:06,010
No, actually... You did so great.

1596
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:09,390
You. Me. We did great.

1597
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:14,110
Will you come with me someplace?
I want to show you something.

1598
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,610
- I have something I need to finish.
- Please?

1599
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,580
Please.

1600
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,340
OK. Here you go.

1601
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:37,970
- Come with me.
- All right.

1602
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,100
- Should I close my eyes?
- No.

1603
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:44,930
So, you see those top two floors
right there?

1604
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,480
I do.

1605
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,810
All mine.

1606
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:53,570
- Wow.
- I know. Come here.

1607
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,410
So this is my...

1608
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,880
..living room.

1609
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,420
It's beautiful.

1610
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,520
What are you thinking?

1611
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:52,620
You've got that look
you have sometimes.

1612
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:54,500
Yeah?

1613
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:57,150
I was just wondering
when you get to move in.

1614
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:59,410
Well, they said two weeks, so...

1615
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,780
OK. This is the dining room.

1616
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:08,510
The fireplace works. Come here.

1617
01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:11,510
I can see elegant parties in here.

1618
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,550
Waiters with caviar,
you in a beautiful gown.

1619
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,140
You can see all that?

1620
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,510
Maybe you're naked and I'm the only
guest, but it would be elegant.

1621
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,730
OK. So this is upstairs.

1622
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:25,350
There's a second bedroom
for a future office or whatever.

1623
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:30,150
And this is my boudoir.

(FAINT MUSIC: "NIGHT AND DAY"

Your boudoir comes
with pretty decent music.

1626
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,530
It does. Where's that coming from?

1627
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:44,280

# Day and night... #

1631
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:58,890
So where's your bed going?

1632
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:03,470
Right here.

# In the roaring traffic's boom... #

1636
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,660
So if you had a bed,

1637
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,950
we'd be dancing on it.

1638
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:41,080

No.

01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,840
I mean I like it here.

01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:52,020
Oh.

- Yeah.

- I've got to talk to you.
- Bye.

That was Nike. They're going
to announce we've won the account.

1653
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:40,430
I gotta hand it to you. You saved
my ass! You save the company's ass!

1654
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,390
I had very little to do
with saving anybody's ass.

1655
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,050
It's Darcy you should be thanking.

1656
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,510
Darcy? I was there yesterday.
She didn't open her mouth.

1657
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:52,240
I'm big enough
to admit when I screw up.

1658
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,730
I looked at the marketplace
and I panicked.

1659
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,070
Nick, forgive me.
I want you to step in here.

1660
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,780
No, Dan. You did the right thing
when you hired her.

1661
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:04,650
She is the best creative director
I have ever seen. Bar none.

1662
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:06,570
This isn't...? I know she's adorable.

1663
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,990
- Yeah.
- This isn't about that, is it?

1664
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,880
No. Not like that. No.

1665
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:15,300
Please, look... I've been doing
a lot of listening lately,

1666
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:20,590
and I've decided I need to take a
leave of absence. I need to get away

1667
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,840
- and get some perspective.
- Are you nuts?

1668
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:24,750
What is this? What do you mean?

1669
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:27,810
This is the biggest account
this company has ever landed.

1670
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:31,010
- You want nobody running the shop?
- Darcy's here!

1671
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,640
For somebody who listens a lot,
you don't hear so well.

1672
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:37,060
I had a meeting with her today.
We had a talk.

1673
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:40,680
Oh, Dan! You didn't.
Tell me you didn't fire her.

1674
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:42,450
She didn't even put up a fight.

1675
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:44,440
- Oh!
- She's gone, pal.

1676
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:46,360
No, no. It's not too late.

1677
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:48,910
Call her. Tell her

- Calm down. I can't do that.
- Why?

1679

I talked to the board and told them
I don't need her any more.

she took it. Besides, Nike want you.

It wasn't even mine!

yesterday came from her.

back in here pronto,

- Who's Erin?

who carries the files?"

Here's the thing, Erin.

to fill that void,

with a tongue ring over you?

01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,050
Honey...

1847
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:34,590
you look beautiful.

1848
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,390
Thanks.

1849
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,430
Take me home, Dad.

1850
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:45,370
What am I doing?
She's not in the refrigerator.

1851
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:03,680
I wonder if it's too late
to go over there.

1852
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,130
Of course it's not. It's never
too late to do the right thing.

1853
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:10,260
I'll go over there
and do the right thing.

Ah, hi. It's me.

I need to...
(DOOR BUZZES)

1861
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:42,620
Hey.

1862
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:44,950
You need to what?
It's one in the morning.

1863
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:47,510
I need to talk to you.

1864
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:49,220
OK.

1865
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:52,590
Thanks.

1866
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:58,180
So, you sleep here now?

1867
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:01,970
Well, I thought I'd give it a try
before I have to sell the place.

1868
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:03,800
Sell it? You're not selling it?

1869
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,220
I can't afford to keep it.
I don't have a job.

1870
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,400
You ought to try returning
some of your phone calls.

1871
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:10,980
You got your job back.

1872
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:14,600
Do I? You're a real riot,
you know that?

1873
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:17,320
It's true. Dan told me so himself.

1874
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:20,520
Why would he? I didn't do the job
that he hired me to do.

1875
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,660
I don't blame him for firing me.

1876
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:24,740
Look, I'm er...

1877
01:57:24,910 --> 01:57:28,030
Come on in. I don't have
any chairs, but if you want to...

1878
01:57:28,210 --> 01:57:31,960
What if I told you that you did
everything you were hired to do,

1879
01:57:32,130 --> 01:57:33,550
everything,

1880
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:36,800
but that someone was sabotaging you.

1881
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:40,590
Picking your brain,
swiping your ideas...

1882
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:45,060
and you never even knew
what hit you.

1883
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,520
How is that possible?

1884
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:49,310
Oh, trust me. It's possible.

1885
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,440
Who would do such an awful thing?

1886
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,820
I would.

1887
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:02,820
I was a dope with a corner office,

1888
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:06,520
and when you came with the job
I was supposed to have...

1889
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:10,200
I mean,
it didn't matter to me that...

1890
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:14,000
you were better at it than me
or you earned it,

1891
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:18,120
I felt it was mine, and I was going
to do anything to get it back.

1892
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:22,790
And so I took advantage of you
in the worst possible way.

1893
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,590
Have you ever done that?

1894
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:31,720
Taken the wrong road?
No, of course you haven't.

1895
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:33,770
You wouldn't do that.

1896
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:37,310
Somebody like me does that.

1897
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:43,150
And er...the problem was that while
I was digging a hole under you...

1898
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:48,740
I found out all about you.

1899
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:54,270
And the more I found out...
the more you dazzled me.

1900
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:00,490
I mean, shook my world,
changed my life, dazzled me.

1901
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:04,710
And guys like that ex-husband
of yours, I mean,

1902
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:10,340
he made you feel that the price
you pay just for being you

1903
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:12,550
is that you don't get to have love.

1904
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:15,470
Isn't that what you were trying
to say the other night?

1905
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:20,050
That you weren't complete? That you
weren't really a winner like that?

1906
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:25,770
Everything about you - how smart
you are, how good you are...

1907
01:59:26,730 --> 01:59:29,900
Everything just makes me
want you even more.

1908
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:37,030
Oh, boy.

1909
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:40,400
It looks like I'm here at one
in the morning being all heroic,

1910
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:42,200
trying to rescue you.

1911
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:44,660
But the truth is...

1912
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:48,870
I'm the one that needs to be rescued.

1913
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:57,630
I sure wish I could read your mind.

1914
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:07,770
Well, I was thinking that um...

1915
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:11,760
if everything you're saying is true,

1916
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:15,720
if I really have my job back...

1917
02:00:21,150 --> 02:00:23,450
then I think you're fired.

1918
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:31,240
I never really thought about it
from that angle.

1919
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:38,320
Well, not that I don't deserve it.
I..d-d-d...

1920
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:40,880
I'm stuttering.

1921
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:58,940
Now I feel kind of embarrassed that
I told you I needed to be rescued.

1922
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:02,650
That's fine.

1923
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:18,910
(DARCY) That's it?

1924
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:26,660
I don't want that to be it.

1925
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:29,410
I don't want that to be it at all.

1926
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:33,720
Then don't let a little thing
like me firing you stand in your way.

1927
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:40,170
I didn't know
what to react to first.

1928
02:01:41,310 --> 02:01:45,720
Hey, newsflash.
I took the wrong road.

1929
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:50,350

in shining armour would I be

1930
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,640
if the man I love needs rescuing

1931
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:56,140
and I just let him walk out my door?
