Mrs. Peterson!

3
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,294
Ramon, hey! How's it goin'?

4
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,664
- How you doin'?
- There it is, there on the desk.

5
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,262
- Where's she headed?
- She's snowbound, Ramon.

6
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,111
- See you went with the pink.
- Yeah, yeah.

7
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,443
It's kind of a pink day today.

8
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,982
I'll have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

9
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,382
- All right. See you then.
- All right. Thanks.

- Da.

Mmm, it's pretty.

24
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,176

(Man ) Time rules over us
without mercy,

or ill, hungry or drunk,

31
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,547
Russian, American, beings from Mars.

32
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,113
It's like a fire. It could
either destroy us or keep us warm.

33
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,853
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

34
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,919
Because we live or we die
by the clock.

35
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,862
We never turn our back on it.

36
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:38,393
And we never, ever allow ourselves
the sin of losing track of time!

37
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,462
Locally, it's 1:56.

38
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,839
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes

39
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,378
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

40
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,007
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...

41
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,917
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster

42
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,147
tries to put us out of business.

43
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,087
Hey, Nicolai.

44
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,216
Good to see you. How are you, kid?

45
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,626
You just delivered your very first
FedEx package.

46
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,096
That deserves something special,

47
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,601
like a Snickers bar and...
a CD player.

48
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,763
And something to listen to.
There. Elvis Presley.

49
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,000
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

50
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,099
You all recognize this, don't you?

51
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,009
I took the liberty of sending
this to myself.

52
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,607
I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.

53
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,517
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

54
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,148
Is it architectural plans?
Maybe technical drawings?

55
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,387
Is this the new wallpaper
for the bathroom?

56
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,724
(Man translating into Russian )

57
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,423
It is...

58
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,262
a clock, which I started
at absolute zero,

59
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:46,294
and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

60
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:51,332
From Memphis, America
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

61
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,608
87 hours is a shameful outrage.

62
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,114
This is just an egg timer!

63
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,482
What if it had been something else?
Like your pay check?

64
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,011
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

65
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,457
87 hours is an eternity.
The cosmos was created in less time!

66
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,758
Wars have been fought
and nations toppled in 87 hours!

67
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,855
Fortunes made and squandered.

68
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,991
(Translating)

69
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,201
What?

70
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,867
- What are you saying about me?
- I tell them, what do they expect?

71
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,776
This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle.

72
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,144
I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.

73
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,981
I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you have to do.

74
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,647
You have to do whatever it takes,
because in three hours two minutes

75
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,748
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck,

76
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,817
on its way to the airport.

77
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,192
- (Bell)
- 15 minutes!

78
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,733
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

79
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,997
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

80
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,129
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

81
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,173
- We have a big problem.
- What?

82
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,005
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What?

83
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,511
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

84
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,380
The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

85
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,561
All right. Let's put the table
right here. We'll just do the sort.

86
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,794
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

87
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,496
Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.

88
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,198
Right here. Two lines, two lines.

89
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,403
One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck. Got it?

90
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,573
CDG, FE, ME, Memphis on the airport
truck. Everything else there.

91
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,208
Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Four minutes.

92
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,541

93
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,078
'Hi, this is Kelly. If you're
calling for Chuck, press one.

94
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,385
'Otherwise, leave a message. Thanks.'

95
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,555

pick up, pick up. You're not there.

I miss you, I really wanna kiss you.

I'm pickin' up the sweep
through Paris.

100
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,010
I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours. That's the good news.

101
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,138
The bad news is...I gotta go
to the dentist this week.

102
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,206
I got something that's hurtin'.

103
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,412
I'll see you soon, and you know
what that means. Bye-bye.

104

tick-tock, tick-tock!

106
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,171
I absolutely, positively
have to get to Memphis tonight.

107
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,303
Can't help you. Try UPS.

108
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,779
Will we be able to push it
and make the sort?

109
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,873
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best"?

110
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,285
Gwen, what's wrong with our doctors
that Jack is certified to fly?

111
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,380
Aren't you concerned?

112
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,789
Terrified, but a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

113
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,420
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal.

114
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:02,160
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle?

115
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,533
I borrowed it. But I love
that the kid's now crippled.

116
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,869
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

117
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,636
Two minutes. Actually, it was less.

118
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,272
The plane wasn't heavy. You could've
added some fuel and picked up speed.

119
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,114
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

120
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,245
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
then six, eight.

121
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,721
Next thing you know,
we're the US Mail.

122
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,851
Well, all I'm sayin' is, if you'd
gotten all those trucks on the plane,

123
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,761
those Russkies would be
walking on water now.

124
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:36,165
Hey, don't give me that look.
It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?

125
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,069
Yeah. It's like a 1992,
full-bodied grape juice.

126
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,266
See no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

127
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,708
We'd offer you some but
somebody's got to fly the plane.

128
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,242
Yeah, well, I "just say no," right?

129
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,316
Listen, Stan,

130
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,353
I've been meaning
to ask you, how's Mary?

131
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,685
Oh. Uh, well...

132
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,920
- We really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hm.

133
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,828
Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday,
and, uh...

134
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,662
It hasn't meta... metastasized...

135
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,704
as far as they can tell right now.

136
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,707
It's just kind of wait and see.

137
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,675
I'm so sorry.

138
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,008
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

139
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,743
I want you to know, Stan, we are all
thinking about her and you,

140
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,411
- and just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

141
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,177

Listen. Uh, I heard about this...

145
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,699
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

146
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,870
He's supposed to be the best.
He worked on Frank Toretto's wife.

147
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,813
Frank's a systems analyst.
He played centerfield for us.

148
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,215
You know him. The softball tournament
last Labor Day.

149
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,151
Anyway, beside the point.

150
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,691
Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...

151
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,523
the doctor...and, uh,

152
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,927
You know, put you all together and...

153
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,000
You know,
you could get this thing fixed.

154
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,093
You could beat it.

155
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,206
Thanks, Chuck. (Sighs )

156
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,798
So, I'll get his number.

157
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,813
- (Student) And why is that?
- When it's chemically ordered...

158
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,295
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

159
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,898
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

160
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,062

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,045
'and even helping them decorate
the special Christmas tree.'

170
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,675
(Bell clanging)

171
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:18,689
'Santa and elves took over the floor
at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.

172
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,055
'Market traders bought Santa hats...'

173
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,128
(TV shuts off)

174
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,219
- The turkey's a bit dry, isn't it?
- (All) No. The turkey is perfect!

175
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,085
(All talking at once )

176
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,560
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

177
00:14:55,628 --> 00:15:00,588
Now, you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

178
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,625
- 2.9 has got to be the record.
- Look at those marshmallows.

179
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,228
We thought two million
was a big deal.

180
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,297
The glory days.

181
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,037
- What'd they do the first night?
- First night?

182
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,942
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

183
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,675
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- (Chuck) That's right.

184
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,547
They did the sort right there
on a card table.

185
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,314
And Fred Smith had
that card table bronzed.

186
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,118
I've been hearing that
for five years.

187
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,354
- It's in his office today.
- From that to the hub at Anchorage.

188
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,795
It's a perfect marriage between
technology and systems management.

189
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,766
Speaking of marriage,

190
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,099
when are you gonna make
an honest woman of Kelly?

191
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,798
How long?

192
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,740
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.
- You won.

193
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,209
- I owe you $5.
- Way before the pie.

194
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,647
I told him. Right about the time
the pie came out, the marriage...

195
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,742
Kelly's still recovering
after that parolee.

196
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,980
He was a lawyer.

197
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,354
I knew it had something to do with
swearing to tell the truth.

198
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,485
Remember when he fell and broke his
shoulder at the wedding reception?

199
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,326
He tripped on a kerb
holding a door open for me.

200
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,765
- Aunt Kelly was married?
- It's not worth remembering.

201
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,702
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...

202
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,466
Oh, my God.

203
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,805
Kelly can't see being with
a man who wears a pager to bed.

204
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,039
What are you gonna attach it to?
When you wear it to bed,

205
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,707
I hope you got one of those things
that goes vibratin'.

206
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,115
I'm not touching that.

207
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,688
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

208
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,817
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

209
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,049
- O.K., I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

210
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,057
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, then I am.

211
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,617
It's cancelled.
But you gotta be here New Year's Eve.

212
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,426
Malaysia can't be that bad.
When do you defend your dissertation?

213
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,693
January 12.

214
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,498
(Sighs ) I'm gonna have to switch over
the South America thing.

215
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,799
If I do that on the third or fourth,

216
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,636
I'll have to head back out
on the 13th.

217
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,734
So long as you're here
New Year's Eve.

218
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,803
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

219
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,712
What?

220
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,619
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

221
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,852
We have to do it in the car.

222
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,256
(Elvis Presley: "Blue Christmas")

223
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,959
I'd just like a minute over here,
all right? Thanks.

224
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:57,732
# But I'll have a blue
blue, blue, blue Christmas... #

225
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,745
Two minutes, O.K.?
Two more minutes. Thanks. Hey!

226
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,113
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

227
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:09,086
What is the ribbon? A thousand-pound
test fishing line or something?

228
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,282
- Here's your fancy thing.
- Thanks.

229
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,528
I love the wrapping.

230
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,130
- And I love the box.
- Good.

231
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,034
Oh.

232
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,937
Oh, my.

233
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, that is terrific.

234
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,545
My grandaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

235
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,247
Hey, I took this.
This is my favorite picture of you.

236
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,979
You know what I'm gonna do?

237
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,288
I'm always gonna keep this
on Memphis time.

238
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,362
Kelly time.

239
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,524
Hmm.

240
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,501
You haven't said anything
about your presents.

241
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,972
I'm sorry. No, I love 'em.
Look at my journal. Ah!

242
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,805
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. Gold on the pages!

243
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,711
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes. I love it.

244
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,772
Look at him in his little blue
Russian house.

245
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,647
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

246
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,312
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No.

247
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,950
You can program it so it vibrates
and lights up and see it in the dark.

248
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,086
It seems like a real nice...pager.

249
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,189
- Sorry about the towels.
- I love 'em!

250
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,325
- You're hard to shop for.
- Every time I wash my hands,

251
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,960
- I will think of you.
- All right, I gotta go.

252
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,097
Merry Christmas.

253
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,905
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.

254
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:38,965
I love you too.

255
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,977
Chuck!

256
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,315
Keys!

257
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,165
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

258
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,600
I have one more present for you.

259
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:10,767
Only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present

260
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,867
like, say, hand towels.

261
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,469
Which were a joke, by the way.

262
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,413
I'm terrified.

263
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:27,220
Just take it and hold onto it, and
you can open it on New Year's Eve.

264
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,385
And I love you.

265
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,861
I'll be right back.

266
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,349
(Plane jolts )

267
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,132
(Sighs )

268
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,207
Hey, Al, where are we?

269
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,307
Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean.

270
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,818
Ha, ha, ha! You pilots, you're funny.

271
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,320
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

272
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,653
Position Jenna at 1526...

273
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,353
Is this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

274
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,862
..Tamara at 1620.

275
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,761
Erick is next.

276
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,063
- Fuel, niner-five-decimal-five.
- (Static over radio )

277
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,664
Blaine, tell them we're deviating.
Make a position plot on your left.

278
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,110
(Blaine ) Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.
Position Jenna at 1526.

279
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,579
- Flight level 350.
- I got us plotted.

280
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,242
We're 200 miles south
of original course.

281
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,347
Continue plotting,
check contingency procedures.

282
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,914
Tahiti Control. FedEx 88 broadcasting
in the blind. How do you read?

283
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,324
- (Static)
- I've never been out this long.

284
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,420
Did you try the higher HF frequency?

285
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,863
(Blaine ) Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

286
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,094
(Al) Better buckle up, Chuck.
It's gonna get bumpy.

287
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,937
(Blaine ) Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.
Do you read?

288
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:36,544
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.
Position Jenna at 1526.

289
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,646
Flight level 350.

290
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,588
Expecting Tamara at 1...

291
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,469
Explosion! Let's get a hose!

292
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,376
Hold on to it! Come on!

293
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,139
Seat belt!

294
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,481
We may have to ditch!

295
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,766
O.K.?

296
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,570
Fire in the hold! We're goin' down!

297
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,868
Mayday! Mayday!

298
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,837

299
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,974
(Confused shouting)

300
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,680
Bringing it down and out!

301
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,020
Ten thousand feet! Masks off!

302
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,117
Masks off!

303
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,132
Chuck! Life vest!

304
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,557
Chuck! Chuck, stay there!

305
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,466
Where's your life vest?

306

Ditching switch on!

307

I've got visual!

Brace for impact!

323
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,611
What is that?

324
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,142
Hey!

325
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,789
Hey!

329
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,782
Hello?

330
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,883
Get! Go, go. Go! Go!

331
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,078
"Albert R Miller."

332
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,949
Not Alan. Albert.

333
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,034
So, that's it.

334
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,445
Hey! A ship! Hey! Hey!

Over here! Over here!

341
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,673
Help me! Help!
Right here! Right here!

342
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,834
Help! Look here!
Look, look, look!

343
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:37,808
S...O...S!

344
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:38,903
Please!

345
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,883
Help! Come on!

346
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,613
Help!

347
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,047
(Screams )

348
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,288
(Screaming)

349
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,356
(Grunts )

350
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,125
(Wind howling)

351
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,239
(Grunts )

352
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,086
"Happy birthday."

353
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,262
"The most beautiful thing
in the world is the world itself.

354
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:57,466
"Johnny, have the happiest birthday
ever. Score! Your Grandpa."

355
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,150
Hmm.

356
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,203
(Crunch)

357
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,823
Come on.

358
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,161
Come on. Come on.

359
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,566
Come on. Come on.

360
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,989
(Screams )

361
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,225
(Yelling)

362
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,829
(Screams )

363
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,399
You wouldn't have a match...
by any chance, would you?

364
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:54,777
Oh, oh, oh!

365
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,163
The air got to it.

366
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,460
The air got to it!

367
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,239
Come on, come on. Come on.

368
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,084
(Gasping)

369
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,213
I did it. I did it.

370
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,588
Fire!

371
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,755
There you go!

372
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,890
Light it up! Come on!

373
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,525
# The time to hesitate
is through... #

374
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:21,591
Ouch!

375
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,762
(Laughing)

376
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,237
Ouch!

377
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:29,004
# No time to wallow in the mire

378
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:32,275
# Try now, we can only lose

379
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,248
# Cos, girl,
we couldn't get much higher

380
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:39,481
# Come on, baby light my fire... #

381
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:42,422
There you go! Here you go!

382
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,891
It's a signal fire!

383
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:49,325
And it spells out SOS!

384
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:51,093
Whoa!

385
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,731
It's a meteor shower!

386
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,737
Fireflies! Go! Run!

387
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,774
You're free! You're free!
Ouch! Ouch!

388
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,776
Yeah!

389
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,074
Yes!

390
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,546
Look what I have created!

391
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,776
I have made fire!

392
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,215
I...

393
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,378
have made fire!

394
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,133
Mmm!

395
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,233
You gotta love crab.

396
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,371
In the nick of time, too.

397
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:44,152
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

398
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,687
Coconut milk's a natural laxative.

399
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,325
Things that Gilligan never told us.

400
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,292
Oh.

401
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,090
Mmm.

402
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,875
Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson?

403
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,604
(Thunderclap )

404
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:19,043
So...Wilson.

405
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:25,457
We were en route from Memphis
for eleven and a half hours.

406
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:29,520
About 475 miles an hour.

407
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,567
So they think that we are right here.

408
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,296
But...

409
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,430
we went out of radio contact

410
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,135
then flew around that storm...
for about an hour.

411
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,305
So that's a distance of what,
400 miles?

412
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:53,744
Four hundred miles squared.
That's 160,000...

413
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,588
times pi, 3.14.

414
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,253
(Muttering)

415
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,993
Five hundred and two thousand,
four...

416
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:08,969
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

417
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,737
That's twice the size of Texas.

418
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,740
They may never find us.

419
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,505
(Thunderclaps )

420
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,115
(Groaning)

421
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,904
This tooth is just killing me.

422
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,568
It started out just hurting
when I bit down,

423
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:52,171
but now it just hurts all the time.

424
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,306
All the time.

425
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,648
It's a good thing there's
not much to eat around here,

426
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,449
cos I don't think I could chew it.

427
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,356
Just keep sucking on all that coconut
and all that crab.

428
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:13,462
And just think, I used to avoid
going to the dentist like the plague.

429
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:19,240
I put it off every single chance
I got. But now...

430
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,868
Oh, what I wouldn't give...

431
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:27,209
to have a dentist
right here in this cave.

432
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:29,341
(Groans )

433
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,455
In fact, I wish you were a dentist.

434
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,829
Yeah.

435
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,922
Dr Wilson.

436
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,442
You wanna hear something funny?

437
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,739
Back home in Memphis,

438
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,785
my dentist's name
is Dr James Spalding.

439
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,408
She's much prettier in real life.

440
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,800
(Groaning)

441
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,431
Ah... Ah.

442
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,331
(Whimpering)

443
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,741
(Yells)

444
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,778
(Thunderclaps )

445
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:37,191
(Clattering)

446
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,525
(Clattering continues )

447
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,659
Shut up!

448
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,564
(Clattering)

449
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,384
(Rumbling)

450
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,467
"Bakersfield"?

451
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,866
Bakersfield!

452
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,425
This could work.

453
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,901
This could work.

454
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,501
22... 44 lashings.

455
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,570
44 lashings. So...

456
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,941
We have to make rope again.

457
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:55,853
Wilson, we have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

458
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,125
Eight lashings of these structurals.
That's 24 apiece.

459
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:11,205
That'll be 100... 160.

460
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,138
Here we are today.

461
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:18,646
That gives us a month and a half
until we're into March and April,

462
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:22,705
which is our best chances
for high tides and offshore breezes.

463
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:30,113
We need... We need 424 feet
of good rope,

464
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:32,716
another 50 feet for miscellaneous.

465
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,855
Round that off to 475 feet
of good rope.

466
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:40,292
Now, if we average 15 feet a day...

467
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:45,269
Plus, we have to build it,

468
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,640
we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.

469
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,310
That's gonna be tight.

470
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,474
That is not much time.

471
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:59,686
But we...

472
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:02,279
We live and we die by time, don't we?

473
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:08,428
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

474
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,423
(Laughs )

475
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,499
I know.

476
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,835
I know.

477
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,358
This is it.

478
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,196
That's all that's left.

479
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,997
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

480
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,129
So we're gonna be short.

481
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,242
Short.

482
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:06,882
We're just gonna have to make
some more out of videotape.

483
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,456
Yes. No, we have time.

484
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,458
We do. We have time. Look!

485
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,722
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

486
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:21,624
I know!

487
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:26,069
Yeah, I know. I know where there's
30 feet of extra rope!

488
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,473
But... But I'm not
going back up there.

489
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,675
There, there. There, you see? Huh?

490
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,448
There. Are you happy?

491
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:58,026
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

492
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:00,396
Huh? You were right.

493
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,667
You were right. It was good
that we did a test,

494
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,606
cos it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

495
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:10,803
I would have landed on the rocks.

496
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,540
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.

497
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,673
Bled to death.

498
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,344
It was the only option
I had though, O.K.?

499
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:20,478
It was what, a year ago?

500
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,580
So let's just forget it.

501
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,654
And what is your point?

502
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,194
Well...

503
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,758
we might just make it.

504
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,532
Did that thought
ever cross your brain?

505
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,474
Regardless, I would rather take
my chance out on the ocean

506
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,570
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island,

507
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:52,142
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddam volleyball!

508
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,189
Shut you up.

509
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,262
Wilson!

510
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:09,661
Wilson!

511
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:18,477
Wilson!

512
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,808
Wilson!

513
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:23,841
Wilson!

514
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:27,553
Wilson.

515
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,356
Wilson!

516
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:37,592
(Sobbing) Oh, God! Wilson! Wilson!

517
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,266
Wilson!

518
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,774
Oh! Oh!

519
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:51,039
Never again.
Never again, never again.

520
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:54,444
You're O.K. You O.K.? Yeah.

521
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,499
Yeah, I know you.

522
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,901
I know you. I know you.

523
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,209
So... We O.K.?

524
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:28,948
O.K.?

525
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,980
O.K.

526
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:13,344
You still awake?

527
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,723
Me too.

528
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,300
You scared?

529
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,404
Me too.

530
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:37,036
(Wind howling)

531
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,078
O.K.

532
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,278
Here we go, Wilson.

533
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,050
You don't have to worry
about anything.

534
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:58,148
I'll do all the paddling.

535
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:00,824
You just hang on.

536
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,404
Not yet! Hold on!

537
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:03,949
Not yet! Not yet!

538
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,391
Not yet!

539
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,991
Stand by, Wilson!

540
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:16,934
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

541
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:37,420
(Laughing) I think we did it!

542
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:40,951
I think we did it!

543
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:43,028
Wilson!

544
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,896
I think we did it!

545
01:38:41,181 --> 01:38:43,877
(Whale song)

546
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:22,306
Oh! They're gone!

547
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:30,557
I don't know why!

548
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,633
(Gushing)

549
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:55,699
Where's Wilson?

550
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,409
Where's Wilson?

551
01:42:00,547 --> 01:42:02,606
Wilson, where are you?

552
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:05,845
Wilson!

553
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:11,554
Wilson!

554
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:13,892
Wilson!

555
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:43,050
Wilson!

556
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:45,182
I'm comin'!

557
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:49,161
Wilson!

558
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:10,774
Wilson!

559
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:13,546
Wilson...

560
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,491
Wilson!

561
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:29,964
Wilson! Wilson!

562
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:42,845
(Gasping)

563
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:44,417
Wilson!

564
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:49,855
Wilson!

565
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,221
I'm sorry!

566
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:55,953
I'm sorry, Wilson!

567
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:58,621
Wilson, I'm sorry!

568
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:01,467
I'm sorry!

569
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:04,295
Wilson!

570
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:06,599
(Sobbing) I can't!

571
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:08,470
Wilson!

572
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:12,310
Wilson!

573
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:30,460
(Sobbing)

574
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:52,441
I'm... I'm sorry.

575
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:57,387
I'm sorry.

576
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:02,159
I'm sorry.

577
01:45:28,722 --> 01:45:30,747
(Whale song)

578
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:02,044
(Alarm )

579
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,914
(Weakly) Kelly...

580
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:11,648
Kelly.

581
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,758
Kelly...

582
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:20,329
(Rings )

583
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:23,068
Hello?

584
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:25,195
Oh, how are you?

585
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:28,571
O.K.

586
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:11,642
45 minutes.

587
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:14,845
One Dr Pepper...

588
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,787
two cups of ice.

589
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:19,917
I like ice.

590
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:24,594
Well, here's the drill.

591
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:27,428
Um, plane pulls in, we get off,

592
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,959
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

593
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:34,106
Fred Smith will say a few words.

594
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:37,871
All you have to do
is smile and say thank you.

595
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:42,038
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

596
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:46,651
She's actually gonna be there, huh?

597
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,280
Well, that's what we have arranged.

598
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,292
- If you're sure you wanna do that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

599
01:48:57,564 --> 01:49:00,624
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

600
01:49:01,101 --> 01:49:03,569
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

601
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:10,838
(Sighs ) Chuck...
Kelly had to let you go.

602
01:49:10,911 --> 01:49:13,004
You know?

603
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:15,877
She thought you were dead.

604
01:49:15,982 --> 01:49:18,007
And we buried you.

605
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:23,846
We had a funeral and a coffin,
a gravestone.

606
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:25,983
The whole thing.

607
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,985
You had a coffin?

608
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:33,722
What was in it?

609
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:37,732
Well, everybody put something in.

610
01:49:37,804 --> 01:49:42,639
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

611
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,734
I put in some Elvis CDs.

612
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:49,639
So you had my funeral

613
01:49:51,952 --> 01:49:54,716
and then you had Mary's funeral.

614
01:49:59,559 --> 01:50:03,051
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

615
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:09,424
I should've been there for you,
and I wasn't.

616
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,806
I'm so sorry.

617
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:21,905
'Four years ago, the FedEx family
lost five of our sons.

618
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:25,609
'That was a terrible and tragic day.

619
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:29,814
'But today, one of those sons,

620
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:33,620
'Chuck Noland,
has been returned to us.

621
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:36,025
'Chuck, welcome home.'

622
01:50:36,096 --> 01:50:37,825
(Applause )

623
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:49,267
(Man on TV) 'Moments ago, Fred Smith
welcomed home Chuck Noland.

624
01:50:49,342 --> 01:50:50,536
'Michelle?'

625
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:54,045
(Woman ) 'It's an incredible story,
to come back from the dead.'

626
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,878
(Man ) 'So amazing that
Fred Smith welcomed him.

627
01:50:56,950 --> 01:51:00,477
'And Fred acknowledged that,
"While time waits for no man,

628
01:51:00,553 --> 01:51:03,488
'"we take time to pause
to honor one of our own."

629
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,820
'Now, that's an expensive pause.'

630
01:51:05,925 --> 01:51:07,950
(TV continues, indistinct)

631
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,968
I'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

632
01:51:16,036 --> 01:51:18,266
No, you're in the right place.

633
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:20,635
You probably don't remember me.

634
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:23,267
I did root canal on you
about five years ago.

635
01:51:23,376 --> 01:51:25,435
Jim Spalding referred you.

636
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:29,439
Oh, yeah, yeah.

637
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:36,281
I'm Kelly's husband.

638
01:51:37,824 --> 01:51:40,292
Jerry Lovett.

639
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,385
Kelly wanted...

640
01:51:43,496 --> 01:51:45,521
Kelly wanted to be here...

641
01:51:48,134 --> 01:51:50,864
Look, this is very hard for everyone.

642
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:55,065
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

643
01:51:59,512 --> 01:52:01,343
Kelly, uh...

644
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:05,976
She's had it rough.

645
01:52:06,052 --> 01:52:09,920
First when she thought she lost you,
now dealing with all of this.

646
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,854
It's confusing.

647
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:14,155
It's very emotional for her.

648
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,194
She's...

649
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:19,458
She's...

650
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:22,831
sort of lost.

651
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:26,170
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

652
01:52:31,711 --> 01:52:33,975
Anyway...

653
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,139
I'm sorry that...

654
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:33,202
(Laughter and chatter)

655
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,365
O.K., people, let's go.

656
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:37,466
Party's over. Let's go home.

657
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:40,206
(Man ) You're gonna
have to be down at the DMV.

658
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,976
O.K., Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

659
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:47,042
I have to brief him on his meetings
with the accountants and attorneys.

660
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,850
I will see you bright and early
in the morning.

661
01:53:49,923 --> 01:53:54,053
- Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

662
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:57,596
Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

663
01:53:57,697 --> 01:53:59,631
Take care.

664
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:04,762
- Good night.
- Good night.

665
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:10,273
You got everything you need? O.K.

666
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:14,609
If you need anything, sign for it,
and I'll see you in the morning.

667
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,479
Get some sleep.
We got another big day tomorrow.

668
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:21,577
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

669
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:25,089
- Bring you back to life, man.
- (Becca ) Bye, Chuck.

670
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:27,217
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

671
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:30,421
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

672
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:16,935
How long are you gonna be, man?

673
01:56:19,038 --> 01:56:21,199
Well...

674
01:56:21,307 --> 01:56:24,868
- How long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

675
01:56:48,935 --> 01:56:50,926
I'm awake.

676
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:53,063
I saw your taxi drive up.

677
01:56:55,742 --> 01:56:57,972
Get in here out of the rain.

678
01:57:04,584 --> 01:57:06,984
I saw you down at the hub today,

679
01:57:07,053 --> 01:57:09,248
so I know you were down there.

680
01:57:27,573 --> 01:57:29,598
Let me get you a towel.

681
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:43,646
They're sleeping.

682
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,993
You'll come in,
I'll make you some coffee?

683
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:04,767
It's a nice house.

684
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:07,312
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too.

685
01:58:14,554 --> 01:58:17,284
What's your daughter's name?

686
01:58:17,356 --> 01:58:18,948
Katie.

687
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,924
Katie.

688
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:28,523
- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.

689
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:44,674
Let me get one thing straight.

690
01:58:54,393 --> 01:58:57,920
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

691
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:01,997
(Exhales )

692
01:59:03,269 --> 01:59:06,466
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. O.K.

693
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:08,598
They used to be in Houston.

694
01:59:08,674 --> 01:59:12,633
First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.

695
01:59:12,745 --> 01:59:15,543
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

696
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:17,513
Yeah.

697
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:19,517
But that's not all.

698
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,611
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

699
01:59:22,688 --> 01:59:25,156
- And I missed that.
- You would've died.

700
01:59:25,258 --> 01:59:29,194
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard, right at the end.

701
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:34,495
I got whole milk,
two per cent and non-fat.

702
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:38,128
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

703
01:59:38,204 --> 01:59:40,263
That'll do fine.

704
01:59:52,818 --> 01:59:55,480
What happened
to you becoming a professor?

705
01:59:57,456 --> 02:00:01,290
You're not Dr Kelly Frears-Lovett?

706
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:06,797
When you, um...

707
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:09,528
When your plane went down,

708
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:12,662
everything just
sort of got put on hold.

709
02:00:14,807 --> 02:00:17,469
I think about
taking it up again, though.

710
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:32,149
I came out here to give you this.

711
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:35,184
Oh, my God.

712
02:00:37,196 --> 02:00:39,221
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

713
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,496
And I, uh, I kept the picture.

714
02:00:44,904 --> 02:00:46,963
It was all faded anyway.

715
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:50,903
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

716
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:54,969
That's a family heirloom
and it should stay in your family.

717
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:08,058
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

718
02:01:08,127 --> 02:01:11,824
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

719
02:01:11,897 --> 02:01:15,594
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

720
02:01:19,739 --> 02:01:22,207
So here's where that ship found you.

721
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:26,604
You drifted about 500 miles.

722
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:28,874
This is where your island was,

723
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:32,440
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

724
02:01:33,853 --> 02:01:36,117
And these are the search grids.

725
02:01:36,222 --> 02:01:39,714
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

726
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:50,967
I never should've gotten
on that plane.

727
02:01:52,672 --> 02:01:55,368
I never should've gotten out
of the car.

728
02:01:58,978 --> 02:02:01,003
I wanna show you something.

729
02:02:02,915 --> 02:02:04,940
Come here.

730
02:02:14,593 --> 02:02:16,618
This is... This is our car.

731
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:20,889
You kept our car.

732
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:26,232
All right, now... This is weird.

733
02:02:34,714 --> 02:02:36,841
It's a good car.

734
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:39,180
Had a lot of memories in this car.

735
02:02:39,251 --> 02:02:41,981
Two very nice memories.

736
02:02:42,054 --> 02:02:44,682
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.

737
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:48,517
So, can I drive it?

738
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:50,653
It's your car.

739
02:02:58,404 --> 02:03:01,498
That's good, cos my...
my taxi's gone.

740
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:08,911
Um...

741
02:03:10,049 --> 02:03:12,517
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

742
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,965
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

743
02:03:37,042 --> 02:03:38,942
I don't know.

744
02:03:39,044 --> 02:03:41,740
It's kind of confusing right now.

745
02:03:41,814 --> 02:03:44,476
Well, you should.

746
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:46,609
I mean, really, you should.

747
02:03:49,054 --> 02:03:50,954
I would.

748
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:55,184
So, what now?

749
02:03:58,164 --> 02:04:00,189
I don't know.

750
02:04:02,535 --> 02:04:04,435
I really don't know.

751
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:14,970
(Starts engine )

752
02:04:17,216 --> 02:04:19,446
You said you'd be right back.

753
02:04:24,356 --> 02:04:26,415
I'm so sorry.

754
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:30,353
Me too.

755
02:05:39,632 --> 02:05:41,463
Chuck!

756
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:45,895
Chuck!

757
02:05:47,706 --> 02:05:49,606
Chuck!

758
02:06:06,825 --> 02:06:08,952
I always knew you were alive.

759
02:06:09,028 --> 02:06:11,053
I knew it.

760
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:13,792
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that,

761
02:06:13,866 --> 02:06:15,891
that I had to let you go.

762
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:19,101
I love you.

763
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,707
You're the love of my life.

764
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:26,868
I love you too, Kelly.

765
02:06:28,247 --> 02:06:30,272
More than you'll ever know.

766
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:32,576
Chuck?

767
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:42,077
You have to go home.

768
02:08:31,203 --> 02:08:33,467
We both had done the math, and...

769
02:08:35,207 --> 02:08:37,038
Kelly added it all up.

770
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:41,737
She knew she had to let me go.

771
02:08:41,847 --> 02:08:44,816
I added it up, knew that I'd...

772
02:08:46,085 --> 02:08:48,144
I'd lost her.

773
02:08:49,988 --> 02:08:53,082
Cos I was never gonna
get off that island.

774
02:08:55,194 --> 02:08:57,719
I was gonna die there,

775
02:08:57,796 --> 02:08:59,855
totally alone.

776
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:09,974
I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was
gonna get injured or something.

777
02:09:13,045 --> 02:09:15,104
The only choice I had,

778
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:20,384
the only thing I could control...

779
02:09:22,221 --> 02:09:24,985
was when and how...

780
02:09:25,057 --> 02:09:27,423
and where that was gonna happen.

781
02:09:27,526 --> 02:09:29,551
So...

782
02:09:31,096 --> 02:09:33,155
I made a rope.

783
02:09:35,234 --> 02:09:38,328
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

784
02:09:41,707 --> 02:09:43,971
But I had to test it, you know?

785
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:46,772
Of course. You know me.

786
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:54,083
And the weight of the log
snapped the limb of the tree.

787
02:09:54,153 --> 02:09:58,852
So I... I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

788
02:09:58,924 --> 02:10:01,620
I had power over nothing.

789
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:14,305
And that's when this feeling came
over me like a warm blanket.

790
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:22,347
I knew, somehow...

791
02:10:22,414 --> 02:10:24,848
that I had to stay alive.

792
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:28,285
Somehow.

793
02:10:29,388 --> 02:10:31,856
I had to keep breathing,

794
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:36,993
even though there was no reason
to hope.

795
02:10:38,497 --> 02:10:42,433
And all my logic said that I would
never see this place again.

796
02:10:47,005 --> 02:10:49,064
So that's what I did.

797
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:52,307
I stayed alive.

798
02:10:52,411 --> 02:10:54,436
I kept breathing.

799
02:10:56,281 --> 02:10:59,079
Then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

800
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:05,579
because the tide came in,
gave me a sail.

801
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:12,220
And now, here I am.

802
02:11:15,534 --> 02:11:19,561
I'm back...in Memphis,

803
02:11:19,638 --> 02:11:21,697
talking to you.

804
02:11:23,308 --> 02:11:25,742
I have ice in my glass.

805
02:11:32,551 --> 02:11:35,019
And I've lost her all over again.

806
02:11:42,461 --> 02:11:45,328
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

807
02:11:50,302 --> 02:11:54,033
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

808
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:03,370
And I know what I have to do now.

809
02:12:05,951 --> 02:12:07,976
I gotta keep breathing.

810
02:12:10,522 --> 02:12:12,990
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

811
02:12:14,359 --> 02:12:17,021
Who knows what the tide could bring?

812
02:12:30,842 --> 02:12:33,310
# I gave a letter to the postman

813
02:12:34,413 --> 02:12:36,438
# He put it in his sack

814
02:12:38,216 --> 02:12:41,344
# Bright and early next mornin'

815
02:12:41,453 --> 02:12:44,183
# He brought my letter back

816
02:12:44,256 --> 02:12:45,883
# She wrote upon it

817
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,983
# Return to sender

818
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:51,319
# Address unknown

819
02:12:53,565 --> 02:12:55,590
# No such number... #

820
02:13:22,461 --> 02:13:24,395
Hello!

821
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,427
Hello!

822
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:38,368
(Whistles )

823
02:13:38,443 --> 02:13:40,707
FedEx!

824
02:14:47,846 --> 02:14:49,677
You look lost.

825
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:51,409
I do?

826
02:14:51,483 --> 02:14:53,747
Where are you headed?

827
02:14:56,922 --> 02:14:59,390
Well, I was just about
to figure that out.

828
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:02,323
Well, that's 83 South.

829
02:15:02,427 --> 02:15:07,490
And this road here
will hook you up with I-40 East.

830
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:09,591
If you turn right,

831
02:15:09,668 --> 02:15:13,570
that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff,

832
02:15:13,638 --> 02:15:15,606
California.

833
02:15:16,675 --> 02:15:18,700
And if you head back that direction,

834
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:22,508
you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.

835
02:15:23,982 --> 02:15:25,813
I got it.

836
02:15:25,884 --> 02:15:27,943
All right, then.

837
02:15:30,522 --> 02:15:32,513
Good luck, cowboy.

838
02:15:32,591 --> 02:15:34,456
Thank you.
