1
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,937
Last night I had an ugly nightmare.

2
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:07,814
Oh, yeah?

3
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,775
What happened, man?

4
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,780
I'm lying down in my bed.
Then I get up...

5
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:18,909
and there's my mother,
may she rest in peace...

6
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:23,163
seated in a chair
with a plastic bag over her head...

7
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:26,541
and she can't breathe.

8
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,837
And I can't help her.

9
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,423
Fuck.

10
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:52,360
What do we do?

11
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:54,696
We'll give them a half hour.

12
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,670
Who are they?

13
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:14,090
Don't worry.
It's just the police.

14
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:19,137
This is a private road.
You have to have a permit.

15
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,390
- Do you have a permit?
- I don't have a permit.

16
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,392
Do you have a permit?

17
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,062
Well, then, we have a problem.

18
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,856
Can we buy a permit?

19
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,901
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,071
- How much?
- Four hundred pesos.

21
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,074
You too-- 400 pesos.

22
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,212
What's underneath the tarp?

23
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:55,758
- Boxes of food.
- Show me.

24
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:21,743
Lay down on the ground, sweetie.
You're under arrest.

25
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,662
Yeah, you guys are screwed!

26
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,069
What's your name?

27
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,701
Javier Rodríguez Rodríguez.

28
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,871
Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.

29
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,044
You've done an excellent job.

30
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,134
But we'll take over from here.

31
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,474
Put the prisoners in the Suburban
and impound the truck.

32
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:21,406
How did you find out about this?

33
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,619
A little bird told me.

34
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,038
What's the name
ofyour little bird?

35
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:32,918
It doesn't have a name.

36
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:38,048
Those fucking anonymous ones!

37
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:43,303
For an officer of the state police...

38
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,557
you're very well-informed.

39
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:00,613
- Hey, was that General Salazar?
- The Big Boss himself.

40
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,200
What is he doing around here?

41
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:06,703
Up to something. I don't know.

42
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:11,416
They took our handcuffs, Manolo.

43
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,964
This informant, paid by police,
using taxpayers' dollars...

44
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,633
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

45
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:23,636
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm,

46
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:27,932
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

47
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:31,811
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

48
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:35,148
- whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.
- Mr. Rodman...

49
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:40,319
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

50
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,655
in choosing what he planted...

51
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,159
as he did
in choosing his attorney,

52
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,286
but, lately,
the only variation...

53
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:51,582
I'm hearing in your argument
is the name of your client.

54
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:55,335
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,

55
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,463
but you're not
gonna convince me...

56
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:02,009
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

57
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:06,638
Furthermore,
there is no sacred protection
of property rights in our country.

58
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:11,602
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre,

59
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:14,021
that farm can be seized...

60
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,356
and that farm can be sold.

61
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:21,278
What the hell is that?

62
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:25,532
You can tell a lot about somebody
from this stuff.

63
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:29,620
- It's from your friends
at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
- A fishing rod.

64
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:33,540
- What do you think they want?
- Depends what state they're from.

65
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,544
Uh... Arizona.

66
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,381
Arizona.

67
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,633
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

68
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:43,635
Or am I being cynical?

69
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,222
Mark... I'm gonna miss you.

70
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,557
Thank you for all your hard work.

71
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,068
Hi. How are you today?

72
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,904
You've got a daughter.
Why is it important to get
a handle on this drug problem?

73
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,573
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

74
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,702
- But I'm planning on being
back here as much as I can.
- How do you feel about--

75
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,942
Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose,

76
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,111
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

77
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:44,113
- I got it.
- You got it, babe.

78
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:47,283
I'm cool, man.
You just don't tell any jokes.

79
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:50,453
- " Don't tell any jokes"?
- Don't tell jokes.
It's a giveaway, Ray.

80
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:53,289
- It's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke,
it's a giveaway.

81
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:56,292
- Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is?
You are too uptight, man.

82
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,794
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath?

83
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,963
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

84
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:02,965
- Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

85
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,010
We're gonna get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

86
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,804
Can I get it?
Can I get it?

87
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,640
- Oh, baby, can I say it?
- Say it. It's show time.

88
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:20,150
We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.
We have a 2:00 appointment.

89
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:22,819
He's right down the hallway
in the back room.

90
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:24,821
Thank you.

91
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:34,247
Come in. Hey, fellas.

92
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,333
Come on, you guys. Get him talking.

93
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,669
- Get him outside.
- How you doing?

94
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,589
- I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good.

95
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,677
Look, what's up, Ed?
We gonna move some white or what?

96
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:50,514
You guys ever bought
a quarter ton before?

97
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,724
- No?
- I don't think so.

98
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:56,728
It's a big fucking deal, all right?

99
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,730
It's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

100
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,525
How many peasants is that
gonna take? You'd have a line
from here to Mexico City.

101
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,239
You say show up at a time, we show up at
the time and we're fucking sitting here.

102
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:10,534
- Sure I can't offer you
something to drink?
- I can offer you ajoke.

103
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,038
You want to hear a joke? I got
a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.

104
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,374
It's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
I'm gonna tell you a joke.

105
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:20,712
All right, why are hurricane
named after women?

106
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:24,048
- I don't know.
- Because when they arrive,
they're wet and wild.

107
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,968
When they leave, they take
your house and your car.

108
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:31,305
- It's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

109
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,307
I chuckled. Damn.

110
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,352
- Fellas... that's us.
- Yo.

111
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:46,571
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move until they get Ruiz outside.

112
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:54,078
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

113
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,249
I got another joke.

114
00:10:58,332 --> 00:11:00,752
- Come on. Please.
-Just one more. Relax.

115
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:03,254
A guy goes, gets a tattoo
put on his penis.

116
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,966
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

117
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,260
- On his penis?
- Yeah. The words "yes" and "no."

118
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:13,766
So, his wife says, "Hold it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house--"

119
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,602
- Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

120
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,521
What the fuck is going--

121
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,857
Shit! Agent down!

122
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,484
Get in there now! Go!

123
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,084
- D.E.A.!

124
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:50,886
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

125
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,972
Go. Shit.

126
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,429
Shit!

127
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:39,205
- I think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, I think so too.

128
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,920
- Don't fucking move!
Get your hands-- Move!

129
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,047
Get out, you son of a bitch!
Get out!

130
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:51,593
Is this what
they wear to go to sleep...

131
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:54,596
or do they hang out like this
the whole time?

132
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:58,809
That would be sleep attire.
- It's like a smoking jacket.

133
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,311
He's gonna be smoking
in a minute.

134
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:04,356
Okay, who's the father of
Greek tragedy? Anyone? Anyone?

135
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,983
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
His trilogy? The Oresteia.

136
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:11,822
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone--
Can anyone stop the Seth machine?

137
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:15,617
- No.
- That's correct. Score.

138
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:21,123
And "tragedy" is closed out.

139
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,128
- But wait.

140
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:29,256
- Is he her husband?
- Yes.

141
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:33,427
Oh, hey, so, uh...
you want to try something?

142
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:36,514
Yeah.

143
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,818
- What are you doing?
-Just watch.

144
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:08,171
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

145
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:10,339
What is this, like freebase?

146
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:13,384
Not "like." It is.

147
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:19,348
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

148
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,939
Hold it.
Hold it.

149
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:30,944
See?

150
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,866
Now you see.

151
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:12,403
Oh, how-- Oh, they're doing great.

152
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:15,239
Look at how cute they are.

153
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:18,742
- Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

154
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,830
Little Tiger, I hope.

155
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,582
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

156
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,584
So will his bank balance.

157
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:29,587
- My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

158
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:31,923
- Helena, you never order duck.
- I know, I know.

159
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:35,760
It's not me who ordered it.
It's somebody else.

160
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,430
Well, he or she
has very good taste.

161
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:40,807
- I love duck, don't you?
- It's delicious.
Do you want some, Nan?

162
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,978
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- It's such a fatty bird.

163
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,647
There's good cholesterol,
and there's bad cholesterol,
which is confusing to me.

164
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:51,443
- Mmm, that's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

165
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,695
It's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

166
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,614
- You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

167
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,616
I'm European.
I say that to my doctor.

168
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,786
"I'm European.
I'm allowed to drink red wine."

169
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,122
Oh, my doctor said it was fine
when I was pregnant.

170
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,292
- A glass a week.
- After my amnio,

171
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,627
he said, "Okay, now you can go
and have a glass ofred wine."

172
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:13,007
- I had two.

173
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:19,305
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

174
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,307
- Thanks a lot.
- Can I bring the bag
in the backwith me?

175
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:24,185
- No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

176
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,479
- Give me the putter.
- All right.

177
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:29,648
In you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

178
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:32,485
Put this down here, okay?

179
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,112
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

180
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:38,324
- You're welcome.
- Okay.

181
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:43,996
David, you're gonna have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

182
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,664
Okay.

183
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,003
Until you officially take over the
Office of National Drug Control Policy,

184
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:54,048
under no circumstances will you speak
to the press unprotected...

185
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,092
without going through this office...

186
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,511
or having someone in the room.

187
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:00,846
There are a lot of interests
in this town.

188
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,848
Right now,
they're scared of you.

189
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:07,687
The reason they're scared
of you: Technically, you have
veto powers over their budgets.

190
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,190
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen,

191
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:12,526
each with a specially
prepared question.

192
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:16,196
They're questions designed for
one thing-- to make them look smart.

193
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,573
If you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

194
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,159
If you treat them
with utter humility, they will.

195
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:24,705
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

196
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,708
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China,

197
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,211
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

198
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:35,298
Also, one month from today,
you will give your first
official press conference.

199
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:40,220
In it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

200
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:43,265
Judge, I just want to be
clear about one thing:

201
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,559
I am not a partisan person,
I am an issue person.

202
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:48,228
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me,

203
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,897
I will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues,

204
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:54,317
the most important ofwhich,
in my opinion, Mexico.

205
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:57,572
I know everyone you're going to meet.
I know what they want and why.

206
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:59,907
It is important
that they like you.

207
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,243
It is not important
that they like me.

208
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:04,912
That is why
I can help protect you.

209
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,749
Like you protected Landry?

210
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:10,084
I see where you're going with that.

211
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:14,255
If I could say one thing: Basically,
a guy like Landry is so autocratic,

212
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,883
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

213
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:21,429
There's a political component
to this job that the general
didn't have any patience for.

214
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:24,515
General, Bob Wakefield.

215
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:24,599
General, Bob Wakefield.

216
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:27,852
-Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

217
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:32,273
-Jeff, you want to excuse us?

218
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,859
Yes, sir.
I'll be right outside.

219
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,445
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

220
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,530
You've done a fine job, General.

221
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:42,116
The Office of National
Drug Control Policy...

222
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,744
is in better shape
than when you found it.

223
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,955
I'm not sure I made
the slightest difference.

224
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:51,460
I tried. I really did.

225
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:54,463
I think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

226
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,840
I plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

227
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:00,302
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

228
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:03,889
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

229
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:07,309
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

230
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:11,647
This is a tough enough job.
I plan on focusing on this.

231
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:17,361
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out,

232
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:20,656
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

233
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:26,495
He said, "When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of,

234
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,165
"open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

235
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,335
"And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of,

236
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,504
open the second letter."

237
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:38,841
Well, soon enough, this guy
found himself in a tight place,

238
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:44,472
so he opened the first letter,
which said, " Blame everything on me."

239
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:47,350
So, he blamed the old man.
It worked like a charm.

240
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:50,019
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of,

241
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,021
and he opened the second letter.

242
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:56,693
It said, "Sit down
and write two letters."

243
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,408
Yeah.

244
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:17,213
Don't you want to know
what kind of car it is?

245
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:22,052
- It's a brown Ford Explorer.
- It was here. It's been stolen.
I want to file a report.

246
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:25,221
A report will not help you
find your car.

247
00:21:25,346 --> 00:21:28,725
- The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

248
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,482
- You call this man...
and he'll find your car.
- I don't get it.

249
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:37,401
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

250
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:39,570
The police will tell him.

251
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:42,239
Why will they tell him,
and they won't tell us?

252
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:44,283
Because we pay him, stupid.

253
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:47,078
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

254
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:50,247
Es correct.
Es correct.

255
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:53,918
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

256
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:56,754
- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

257
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,340
- No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

258
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:03,094
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

259
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:06,222
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

260
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:27,619
-Javier Rodriguez.
- Si.

261
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,627
We want you to come with us.

262
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:40,090
- Where?
- It's just a short trip.

263
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:44,219
Follow me.

264
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:46,221
Bien.

265
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,526
I would say one thing
to you,Judge,

266
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:02,988
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

267
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:05,657
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities,

268
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:08,243
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

269
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:12,664
We in the legal drug business--
Merck and Pfizer and the rest
of my very important clients--

270
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,543
realize that we're not fighting
a war here with a traditional
winner and loser.

271
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:18,545
I don't know that
you can win this war.

272
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,548
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs,

273
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:24,010
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs--

274
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:27,013
-If you reduce that to 10,
that's a great improvement.
- Right.

275
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,515
I'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement,

276
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,643
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

277
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,937
Can I get a scotch and soda, please?

278
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:37,356
The price of coke
and heroin has dropped,

279
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,193
but purity has increased.

280
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:43,738
All this law enforcement
has really achieved is that
kids get better stuff cheaper.

281
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:46,365
Education, rehabilitation,
prevention--

282
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,367
that's not significant
to these reporters.

283
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,370
- Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

284
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,456
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

285
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,458
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

286
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,877
- I look forward to working
with you in the future.
- Well, call me.

287
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:00,380
I have a good bill
on treatment-on-demand.
I could use your help.

288
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,965
- Wonderful. Look forward to it.
Thanks, Senator.
- Okay. Great.

289
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,927
If a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth,

290
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,929
- I'll do a story on it.
- Right.

291
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:09,931
- Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

292
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:12,393
I don't care who's president. I don't
care who the members of congress are.

293
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,395
I don't care
who you have to deal with.

294
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,108
If you're independent and you
use that bully pulpit right,
that's where your power is.

295
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:21,110
It's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

296
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:23,237
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

297
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,280
Addicts don't vote.

298
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:33,872
What the hell
are you doing here?

299
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,419
You like your view?

300
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,339
- TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

301
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,761
Hope it's all good because this
is as good as it's gonna get...

302
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,597
for a long time, Eduardo.

303
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:54,017
I'm a legitimate businessman.
I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.

304
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,019
- Check it out!
- Shut the fuck up!

305
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,522
- Fucking can it, bitch!
- You can't come in here like that!

306
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:00,107
- I want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

307
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,776
It's cool, man.

308
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,947
- Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- It's cool.

309
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:13,621
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep--

310
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:17,000
- that's capital punishment
in some states, right?
- Yeah, down in Texas.

311
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,002
- They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

312
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:21,004
We've got him making
the deal on tape.

313
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,965
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

314
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,468
- We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

315
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,595
No, no, he's fucked.

316
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:34,434
I only see one way
out of this predicament.

317
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,402
You make us believe
you got a boss, Eddie.

318
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:48,490
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

319
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,575
No.

320
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:53,495
No, that's a death sentence.
I'd never make it to the trial.

321
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,500
- Look, we're gonna protect you.

322
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,419
- Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

323
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:04,507
That's a big word
for a fisherman.

324
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:07,551
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

325
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:10,846
I know another big word.

326
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,973
Immunity.

327
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,940
Take it easy, will you?

328
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,942
What's going on in here?

329
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:25,027
- We have a warrant
to search your premises.
- What?

330
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,154
Carl!

331
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,365
My husband!

332
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,367
- Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl!

333
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,786
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

334
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:36,622
- David, come here!
- Ma'am, I have a search warrant.

335
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,416
He'll be back.

336
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:42,878
Where are they taking Daddy?

337
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,922
He'll be all right.

338
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,885
He's all right. They're just gonna
take him to the office and talk.

339
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,887
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

340
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:53,223
- I don't understand what's going on.
- He'll be all right.

341
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:55,892
- What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's gonna be okay.

342
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:59,730
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay, baby.

343
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,122
Not you.

344
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,206
You.

345
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:24,713
I'll wait here.

346
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,092
Five years with the Tijuana police.

347
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:33,722
Three years in the state police.

348
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:41,481
Your parents died when their house
flooded in the rains of '93.

349
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,902
How unfortunate.

350
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:55,578
You make $316 a month.

351
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,916
That's what they pay.

352
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,293
Well, look.

353
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,384
This could be your past.

354
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,015
We can talk about your future...

355
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:20,853
if you can do me a favor.

356
00:28:21,312 --> 00:28:23,231
If I can.

357
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:31,948
I want to wipe out
the Tijuana cartel.

358
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,497
What can I do to help?

359
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:45,254
His name is Francisco Flores.

360
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:48,173
He's an assassin.

361
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:51,969
He runs guns for the Tijuana cartel.

362
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,056
I have to talk to him.

363
00:28:56,181 --> 00:29:00,602
I need you to find him
and bring him here.

364
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,357
- This is crazy!
- Don't freak out, Manolo.

365
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,735
Don't you know
who "Frankie Flowers" is?

366
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:14,366
A hired assassin! A psychopath!
Fucking crazy!

367
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,328
- Who knows how many he's killed!
- Then I'll go by myself.

368
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:21,290
And we can't ask for help...

369
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,792
because he lives in San Diego.

370
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:33,553
Ah.

371
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:38,058
Well... is this
a surprise or what?

372
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:40,226
An honor.
Thank you.

373
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:42,562
- Hi, sweetie.
- Good trip?

374
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:46,566
- How are you?
- Good trip. I'm good.
I just can't believe this.

375
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:50,236
- What's Washington like?
- It's like, uh--

376
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:53,406
It's like Calcutta;
surrounded by beggars.

377
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:56,409
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

378
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:59,537
and they don't say
"please" and "thank you."

379
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:04,459
So, we put
the case before the arbitration panel,

380
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:07,003
none of whom have
any expertise.

381
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:09,005
"Superfund" is just
one of those words.

382
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:11,007
People stop paying attention.

383
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:15,470
- It's frustrating.
- It's so frustrating.

384
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:17,472
Did you meet the president?

385
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:20,101
Honey, your father
knows the president.

386
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:23,104
It just so happens... that
the president of the United States,

387
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:25,106
my new boss,
the leader of the free world,

388
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,359
has penciled me in
for a little face time.

389
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:31,779
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

390
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:36,784
- Caroline.
- I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

391
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:39,787
It's great.
It's great, Daddy.

392
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:43,457
It's just amazing, that's all.

393
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,173
Arnie, thank God.

394
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:53,634
Helena, I am so--

395
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,803
Please tell me
what's going on here.

396
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:58,806
What is going on? They came into
the house. They just took him away.

397
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,475
They searched my home.

398
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,019
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

399
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:08,816
First of all, Carl is not here.

400
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:11,319
The D.E.A. has got him.

401
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,488
They're gonna hang onto him
until his arraignment,

402
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:15,991
which will probably be tomorrow.

403
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:19,995
So here you are wasting your time.
All right? Are you with me?

404
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,540
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

405
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,168
over the telephone.

406
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:29,504
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

407
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:32,340
- What is he charged with, Arnie?
- I don't know,

408
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:37,262
but under no circumstances
am I going to talk about it here.

409
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:41,516
Now, you go home and be with your son.
All right?

410
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:38,074
Miss?

411
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,243
Can I have a Budweiser?

412
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:51,796
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

413
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,966
Can you give me a cigarette?

414
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:54,778
It would be interesting to know
how you did it so quickly.

415
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:59,657
We all have our weak side.

416
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:05,205
The path of the Lord
is very subtle.

417
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:06,498
Amen.

418
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:17,342
What a badass.

419
00:34:21,346 --> 00:34:26,184
All I'm saying--
What I'm-- What I'm saying is...

420
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:30,522
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

421
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:35,026
We all look at each other
and nod with these--

422
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:41,033
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

423
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:43,202
Responses--
Not real responses.

424
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:48,374
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles;

425
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,543
surface bullshit.

426
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:52,712
Do I ever just say:

427
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:56,549
" Hey... I'm uncomfortable
in this crowd."

428
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:59,051
"I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either."

429
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:03,389
"l know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because--"

430
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:07,226
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

431
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:09,228
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

432
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,230
like our parents seem
and their parents before them.

433
00:35:11,355 --> 00:35:14,567
I'm sorry I have to be the one
to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.

434
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:17,403
- For instance?
- I know you jack off
to Caroline every night,

435
00:35:17,528 --> 00:35:19,572
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

436
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:23,409
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

437
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:25,411
Because what is that convention?

438
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,788
We're this random collection
of self interests,
and all of a sudden we decide...

439
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:32,460
that we're gonna walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?

440
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:36,256
Actually, for your information,
when I jerk off,

441
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:39,760
I'm not just thinking about Caroline,
I'm thinking about you with Caroline.

442
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:42,596
- So, how about that?
- Baby--

443
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:49,269
That is what
I'm talking about-- sarcasm.

444
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,606
Always fucking sarcasm.

445
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:56,276
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that,

446
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:58,779
people will think
that you are weak...

447
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:01,948
or they won't like you...

448
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:05,619
or whatever it is
you think will happen, but--

449
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:09,956
Can you shut up for one second
and listen to yourself?

450
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:11,958
Wh-What?

451
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:17,339
Because you are so fucking right.

452
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:19,633
- I'm so fucking high.
- Yeah?

453
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:22,010
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

454
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:24,137
Why don't we...

455
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:27,975
change this thing,
this social pattern?

456
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,685
Why don't we be different?

457
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:33,314
- Yeah.
- But then why are you
even talking about it?

458
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:35,650
But we're making it,
like, from now on.

459
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:39,362
You're like,
"Why don't we do something?"

460
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,906
- Why don't you do something?
- That's what I'm saying, Seth.

461
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:45,410
- You do it yourself--
- I'm saying if you knew it,
you wouldn't even say it.

462
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:47,412
Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.

463
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:51,707
It's a social pattern, you know?

464
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:59,507
Spence, baby, are you all right?

465
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,551
He's fucking blue.
He isn't breathing.

466
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,762
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up.

467
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:08,182
- Wait--
- What the fuck do we do?

468
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:11,561
- Uh-- Oh, God--
- Fuck!

469
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:15,565
- Somebody call a doctor!
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

470
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,026
No, he's a research--
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

471
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,946
- What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

472
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:23,240
Call your dad!
He's a neurosurgeon!

473
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,451
I can't call my dad!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

474
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,538
He's gonna fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something!

475
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:33,667
No, he can't die on the floor!
His parents are in Barbados!

476
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,888
Move! Move!

477
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,243
Okay, nobody has anything
on them, right?

478
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:10,245
Fuck!

479
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,509
We know that you killed
our chief of intelligence.

480
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,221
We also know that you...

481
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,394
killed police chiefs
in Tijuana and Mexico City.

482
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,439
A question.

483
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,609
Why do you resist?

484
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,033
My father has money.

485
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,537
That is not the correct answer.

486
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,624
We also found out...

487
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,545
that you hunted down
a neighbor of General Salazar.

488
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,172
A poor peasant.

489
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,509
Your people killed
his granddaughter.

490
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,513
That was a stupid thing to do.

491
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,016
- You fucked up.

492
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm on the board
of my son's school.

493
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:14,039
I have fund-raisers
for adult literacy at my own home.

494
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:20,587
I think I have a right to know if
my husband is a legitimate businessman.

495
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,215
Of course he is.

496
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,511
I've known Carl for 20 years.
He doesn't even jaywalk.

497
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:37,229
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

498
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:39,731
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A.,

499
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:44,236
they're gonna be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

500
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:51,577
Carl is very, very good
at his business.

501
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:59,419
Which is smuggling illegal drugs
into this country.

502
00:41:12,682 --> 00:41:14,934
- They're whispering.
They're whispering.
- I know.

503
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,604
- Can't hear it.
- I know. The fucking bug's
too far away from the room.

504
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,107
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not gonna get shit.

505
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,109
They're saying something.

506
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,695
Sounds like they're conspiring
to conspire.

507
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:28,281
I can feel the lies vibrating
from their home.

508
00:41:30,742 --> 00:41:32,618
I don't think
she's in on it, man.

509
00:41:32,744 --> 00:41:36,289
Come on, I dream about this.
I have actual dreams about this.

510
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:39,459
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

511
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,296
- White people. Hey.
- White people. I know, I know.

512
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:45,132
I don't think she's in on it, man.

513
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:48,135
She knows Arnie Metzger.

514
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,804
So does half of San Diego.

515
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:53,640
- You want to bet?
- Get in your pocket.

516
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:55,809
- I got--
- I love it. I love it when you do this.

517
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:59,813
- How much you want to bet? How much?
- I got-- I got 12 bucks.

518
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:03,484
- Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.
- Okay.

519
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:06,612
- Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

520
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:13,869
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

521
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,623
Live with your parents?

522
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,125
Yes.

523
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,127
Parents still together?

524
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:24,129
Yes.

525
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:29,676
- Do you work?
- I volunteer.

526
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:33,890
I read to blind people,
one day a week for two hours.

527
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:37,185
In school?

528
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,021
Yes.

529
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:42,023
Private?

530
00:42:42,148 --> 00:42:44,025
Yeah.

531
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:48,196
How are your grades?

532
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:53,034
- I'm third in my class.
- What does that mean?

533
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:58,039
- I get A's, all A's.
- You do?

534
00:42:58,164 --> 00:43:00,542
What else do you do?

535
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,877
I'm a National Merit Finalist.

536
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:06,005
I'm on the Hi-Q Team
and the Math Team.

537
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:08,716
I'm in the Spanish Club.
I'm a thespian.

538
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:11,886
I'm vice president of my class.

539
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:13,888
I'm on the volleyball team.

540
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:21,146
You want to tell me
what you're doing here, Caroline?

541
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:42,126
Carol.

542
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:46,255
Oh, sweetie.

543
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:51,093
You okay?

544
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,680
It's okay.

545
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,018
Caroline, how well did you know
this boy that overdosed?

546
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:02,438
He didn't hang around us.

547
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:05,274
He was like one
of those hippie kids.

548
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,610
I'm not part of that group.

549
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:14,575
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

550
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:19,289
He's a friend.

551
00:44:19,414 --> 00:44:23,585
He's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

552
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:28,048
He definitely had
a few beers, but...

553
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:30,300
it's not like
he wanted to drive.

554
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:32,928
We just didn't know
what else to do.

555
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:36,640
It wasn't my pot.

556
00:44:39,101 --> 00:44:43,105
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

557
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,273
Alone.

558
00:44:53,448 --> 00:44:56,159
- I think she's lying.
- Me too.

559
00:44:56,284 --> 00:44:58,829
So let's ground her,
clip her wings:

560
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:02,165
school, scheduled activities
till further notice.

561
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:07,546
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment,

562
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:12,844
but don't you think spending a night
in jail is punishment enough?

563
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:16,180
I mean, we've all
had our moments.

564
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:20,393
- Lord knows, I tried
every drug there was--
- I don't want to hear about that.

565
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:23,354
You experimented
when you were in college.

566
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:25,356
Shall we take the quotes off
experiment and call it what it was?

567
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:27,358
- This is different.
- Why?

568
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:32,697
- She's 16 years old!
- I think she needs to find out
for herself, on her own.

569
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:36,367
- We have to allow her room
to figure out--
- You want to give her room?

570
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:38,619
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

571
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:42,874
I am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this behavior...

572
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:44,876
because we do not.

573
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:48,296
- Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want
to push her away.

574
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:53,551
She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.

575
00:45:53,676 --> 00:45:56,179
How long have you known
about this?

576
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,059
How long have you known?

577
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:05,981
Six months.

578
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:17,076
My technique is more profound
than yours, Javier.

579
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,621
Much more profound.

580
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:23,999
When he loves me like a father,

581
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:27,086
he will never tell anyone
he was here.

582
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:32,174
He will give me
the names of his superiors.

583
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:37,054
Then we get them
and they too will give us names.

584
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:45,646
And eventually somebody
will get us to Juan Obregón.

585
00:46:47,648 --> 00:46:52,778
And on that day,
the Tijuana cartel will fall.

586
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:10,255
What a disgrace.

587
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:14,801
What a disgrace, Francisco Flores.

588
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:19,597
It's all right. Salazar is here.

589
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:24,561
You're among friends now.

590
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:28,148
This shameful treatment
will stop immediately.

591
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,483
Guard!

592
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:31,985
Yes, General.

593
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:38,366
Are you responsible for this?

594
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:41,536
- We are not savages!
- Yes, General.

595
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:44,080
- Has he eaten?
- I don't know, sir.

596
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:48,043
- Go get him some clothes.
- Yes, General.

597
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:55,009
Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...

598
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:59,513
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

599
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:02,183
Our case against him is very strong.

600
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:06,854
He is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

601
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:10,858
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

602
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:14,195
My client is no more
a flight risk...

603
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,447
than Your Honor
or the able prosecutor.

604
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,532
He's a pillar
of his community;

605
00:48:18,657 --> 00:48:22,536
a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla,

606
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,122
the communitywhere he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

607
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:27,124
As our defense
will quickly show,

608
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,126
my client is guilty
of nothing more...

609
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,129
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

610
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:35,591
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

611
00:48:37,176 --> 00:48:39,053
I'm going to deny bail.

612
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:13,422
I appreciate you coming in
so early this morning.

613
00:49:13,547 --> 00:49:15,757
Judge Wakefield,
it's an honor to handle it.

614
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:18,927
She's a minor. It probably would have
expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

615
00:49:19,052 --> 00:49:23,932
Nevertheless, this is asensitive issue
for me. I'm sure you can understand.

616
00:49:24,057 --> 00:49:27,602
Like I said, open container,
P.I., misdemeanor possession.

617
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:29,604
It's easy to make it go away.

618
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:34,944
One thing bothers me: The kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

619
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:38,072
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

620
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:40,783
So I've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?

621
00:49:40,908 --> 00:49:43,161
I don't know what you mean.

622
00:49:43,286 --> 00:49:48,541
I mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

623
00:49:52,086 --> 00:49:53,963
No.

624
00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:56,966
I don't know.

625
00:49:57,091 --> 00:50:00,970
- Is she in any kind of therapy,
professional help?
- No, no, no. No way.

626
00:50:01,095 --> 00:50:04,098
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

627
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:11,689
Well, I hope it stays that way.

628
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:22,200
Yeah, hi, it's Robert.

629
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:26,121
I want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

630
00:50:26,205 --> 00:50:30,292
Because I'm tired of talking to experts
who've never left the beltway.

631
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:33,170
It's time
to see the front lines.

632
00:51:08,163 --> 00:51:11,208
Carlos Ayala started out
in the family connection business--

633
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:16,213
real estate in Tijuana,
fishing boats out of Ensenada,
hydroponic strawberries.

634
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,842
Then he met up with the Obregon brothers
ofthe Tijuana cartel.

635
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:21,386
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

636
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:25,390
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

637
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,560
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to reduce those odds.

638
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,229
So, you pay off
customs officials?

639
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,899
Well, you know, in Mexico...

640
00:51:35,024 --> 00:51:38,236
law enforcement is
an entrepreneurial activity.

641
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,989
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh--

642
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:44,200
We hire drivers with nothing to lose and
throw a lot of product at the problem.

643
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:47,078
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
It's not difficult.

644
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:52,250
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
It's gonna continue to work for years.

645
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,837
NAFTA makes things even
more difficult for you because
the border's disappearing.

646
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,424
Do you realize in the next
year or two at the outside
Mexican trucking companies...

647
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,594
are gonna be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

648
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,598
with the same freedom
as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

649
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:11,812
- It's gonna be a free-for-all.
- What, are we on Larry King
or something?

650
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:14,273
Shit.

651
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:16,776
Tell us something
we don't know, Eddie.

652
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:20,112
You guys remind me of those Japanese
soldiers left on deserted islands...

653
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,948
who think World War II
is still going on.

654
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:27,495
Let me be the first to tell you,
your government surrendered
this war a long time ago.

655
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,664
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help in front of a jury.

656
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:34,126
- It's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.

657
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,423
Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.

658
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,637
Well, I got greedy, didn't I?

659
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,972
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

660
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:50,476
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

661
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,978
Carl never would have
been so stupid.

662
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:56,857
Well, Carl hired you.
That was a mistake.

663
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,739
Carl and I have been friends
since we were little kids.

664
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:06,159
He was loyal.

665
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:12,833
Javi.

666
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:15,460
A group of us are going to a party.

667
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:17,295
Who?

668
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:22,759
Esteban, Guzmán, Tomás,
all of them.

669
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:25,178
Your new buddies.

670
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:28,473
Yes.

671
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:30,183
- Let's go.
- No.

672
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:33,145
- It'll be fun.
- Another day.

673
00:53:37,232 --> 00:53:40,861
At my house I have
some B&W speakers.

674
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:45,407
A while ago I bought a CD burner.

675
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:49,411
I make CDs with the music I want.

676
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:53,665
Just like I bought them in a store.

677
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,337
You and I have a lot in common.
Not everything, but a lot.

678
00:53:58,421 --> 00:54:02,633
We both studied on the other side
with the gringos.

679
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,512
Your father is an engineer, right?

680
00:54:06,596 --> 00:54:10,141
My father-- may he rest in peace--
was also an engineer.

681
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,688
I've been into stereos
since I was very young.

682
00:54:16,814 --> 00:54:19,233
Most people don't care...

683
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:24,739
but for me it's very important.

684
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:38,544
They say in Latin:

685
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:41,881
In vino veritas.
Wine brings out the truth.

686
00:54:45,093 --> 00:54:47,888
Use this to write down...

687
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:53,310
the addresses of those bastards
who killed my captains.

688
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:59,400
And not where they were last week,
but where they are now.

689
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:02,528
Where they are this minute.

690
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:06,865
And better yet,
where they are going to be tomorrow.

691
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:14,915
You know where they are going
to be tomorrow, right?

692
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:01,087
Reported by the government
news agency, Notimex (NTX) :

693
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:08,678
"Yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army,
acting on an anonymmous tip...

694
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:16,102
joined with police to arrest members
of the Obregón brothers drug cartel.

695
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:23,485
Head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen.
Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico City...

696
00:56:23,568 --> 00:56:29,324
that the sweep was a crippling blow
to the Obregón brothers...

697
00:56:29,407 --> 00:56:34,997
who reportedly dominate
the narcotics trade...

698
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:41,337
in the city of Tijuana
and the rest of Baja California state.

699
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:49,178
General Salazar wen t on to say that
the au thorities were working overtime...

700
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:57,269
to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal,
head of the rival Juárez cartel...

701
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:02,983
died last week during
a plastic surgery procedure."

702
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,071
Here it is, here it is.

703
00:57:09,782 --> 00:57:11,826
Get out, asshole.

704
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:14,620
- Are you going to kill me?
- No.

705
00:57:15,454 --> 00:57:18,374
No, the Obregóns
will do that for us.

706
00:57:40,313 --> 00:57:42,232
The port of San Ysidro, California:

707
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:46,236
45,000 vehicles on average,
25,000 pedestrians per day.

708
00:57:51,783 --> 00:57:55,620
- In the last six months,
a threefold increase?
- Increase in narcotics seizures.

709
00:57:55,704 --> 00:57:59,416
Would that mean, pro rata, three times
as much drugs is getting in?

710
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:02,711
That's a scary way to figure it,
but I believe that's true.

711
00:58:02,794 --> 00:58:06,131
In my heart, I'd love to say
that we were getting 60 or 70%.

712
00:58:06,256 --> 00:58:11,052
In the reality, we're more like 40 or
50% of the total that's approaching us.

713
00:58:11,136 --> 00:58:13,388
And it's all big-dollar issues now.

714
00:58:13,472 --> 00:58:15,390
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

715
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:17,810
It's one organization
fighting another organization.

716
00:58:17,935 --> 00:58:19,812
When things are good,
people don't kill each other.

717
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:21,981
When things are bad,
when they're losing dope,

718
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:23,983
when they're losing drivers
and guys are going to jail,

719
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:26,110
people start killing each other.

720
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:38,664
- How's David?
- "How's David?"

721
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:42,376
- Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Oh, Helena--

722
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:44,796
He watched his father
being dragged away by federal agents.

723
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:47,882
- He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

724
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:50,635
I can't even begin
to tell him where you are...

725
00:58:50,718 --> 00:58:53,304
and when you're coming home,
if you're ever coming home.

726
00:58:53,387 --> 00:58:57,475
Helena... we're gonna get through this.

727
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,519
I promise.

728
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:04,023
- I'll make it up to you.
- Do you have any idea
what's going on out here?

729
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:07,235
Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.

730
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,616
The people in the bank--
you should see the way they
look at me when I walk in.

731
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:14,827
I have a letter
from the government telling me...

732
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:18,872
anything I sell from the house will be
taken against an income tax lien.

733
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:22,084
Our fucking friends--

734
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:25,671
Nobody will help us.
Nobody will take us in.

735
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:28,799
Nobody wants anything
to do with us, Carl.

736
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:32,136
So, you just tell me
how you're gonna make it up to me.

737
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:36,056
Helena--

738
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:39,184
Just tell me what to do.

739
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:42,354
I'm not bringing a child into the life
that I was brought up into.

740
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:44,815
I won't do it, Carl.

741
00:59:44,898 --> 00:59:47,901
I want our life back.

742
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,667
Yeah, we're smarter.
We know the difference.

743
01:00:44,793 --> 01:00:48,505
Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

744
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,382
- Hi, folks.
- Hello.
- Hi. Room 310, please.

745
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:56,180
- Okay, I need to see some
I.D.s, please, and $28.
- Okay.

746
01:00:58,015 --> 01:01:00,101
Man, I love this place.

747
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:27,461
I wish we could
just stay here.

748
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:31,507
Just be here forever
and ever and...

749
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,218
make a little home here.

750
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,067
I want to, uh...

751
01:01:49,192 --> 01:01:53,655
I want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

752
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,330
Okay.

753
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:40,203
The first time I got laid
was on a beach just like that.

754
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:45,083
- You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.

755
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,877
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

756
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,338
- That's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

757
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:53,424
Did he treat you good?

758
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:11,442
- Who's this guy?
- I don't know.

759
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:13,778
- I never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

760
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:20,159
David!

761
01:03:22,203 --> 01:03:24,622
David, come back here!

762
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:28,709
- Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

763
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:31,213
Shouldn't let
your kid wander off with strangers.

764
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:35,175
Karen, if he tries to move
with that kid, you break cover.

765
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:39,763
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes
a lot of money. Snapping this
kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

766
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:42,808
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is gonna disappear,

767
01:03:42,891 --> 01:03:45,519
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

768
01:03:45,644 --> 01:03:49,148
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

769
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:17,885
-Javier.
- Yes?

770
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:21,805
What's up, Ana?

771
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:26,603
Manolo never came home last night.

772
01:04:27,228 --> 01:04:29,606
Come in, come in. Sit down.

773
01:04:35,028 --> 01:04:37,363
I don't know where he is.

774
01:04:38,198 --> 01:04:40,033
He wasn't with you last night?

775
01:04:40,116 --> 01:04:42,035
No.

776
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:47,165
I'm worried.

777
01:04:47,248 --> 01:04:49,959
Don't worry too much.
It makes you ugly.

778
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:53,421
Do you want a coffee?
Coffee with sugar?

779
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,548
- No.
- No?

780
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:59,302
Look, Javier.

781
01:05:00,595 --> 01:05:02,931
I was going through his clothes
the other day.

782
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:07,143
Look what I found.

783
01:05:10,522 --> 01:05:12,273
What is it?

784
01:05:19,156 --> 01:05:23,452
- What were you doing?
- I was with friends from work.

785
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:27,623
Was Salazar there?

786
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:31,252
No.

787
01:05:31,335 --> 01:05:33,963
The general is going
to Mexico City next week...

788
01:05:34,088 --> 01:05:36,298
and I'm not going
to get left behind.

789
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:03,117
Javier Rodriguez.

790
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:06,412
The word is you're not
that happy in your work.

791
01:06:06,579 --> 01:06:09,332
Maybe we can help.

792
01:06:27,726 --> 01:06:30,771
-John, how are you?
Bob Wakefield, pleasure.
-Judge, welcome.

793
01:06:30,896 --> 01:06:33,023
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

794
01:06:33,148 --> 01:06:35,776
EPIC is very unique.

795
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:39,738
It's a facility that has over 15
different agencies--state and local--

796
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:42,240
that participate
in gathering intelligence...

797
01:06:42,324 --> 01:06:44,659
and making sure
that information gets out...

798
01:06:44,743 --> 01:06:48,705
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

799
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:53,668
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats,

800
01:06:53,752 --> 01:06:55,837
anything that carries drugs.

801
01:06:55,962 --> 01:06:59,341
When the information comes in,
we're able to check
with different databases...

802
01:06:59,424 --> 01:07:01,344
to see if it's
in the system or not.

803
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:04,138
And would most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

804
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:08,684
The Juarez, the Obregon brothers--
Are those the two that would be
most important?

805
01:07:08,768 --> 01:07:11,354
Those are the two
clearest threats right now.

806
01:07:11,479 --> 01:07:14,107
They are the dominant force
in trafficking,

807
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,275
both on the Mexican side
and in the U.S.

808
01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:19,487
How are the cartels achieving...

809
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,740
the level of intelligence and
sophistication that they're showing?

810
01:07:22,865 --> 01:07:25,827
- Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.

811
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:28,496
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

812
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:32,333
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue,

813
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:35,628
- they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.

814
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:39,090
- "Way beyond"?
- Our budgetary process
makes us pale in comparison.

815
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:46,431
That house you're looking at over there
used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

816
01:07:46,556 --> 01:07:48,891
His nickname was Scorpion.

817
01:07:49,016 --> 01:07:51,060
I'll let you figure out
what that means.

818
01:07:51,185 --> 01:07:53,689
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

819
01:07:53,772 --> 01:07:56,066
Best of our information, yes.

820
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,610
Who do you interact with
on that side?

821
01:07:58,736 --> 01:08:01,029
Nobody.

822
01:08:01,113 --> 01:08:03,741
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

823
01:08:03,866 --> 01:08:06,994
Your position doesn't exist
over there yet.

824
01:08:14,793 --> 01:08:17,504
I want
everyone thinking out of the box...

825
01:08:17,588 --> 01:08:19,590
for the next few minutes.

826
01:08:19,673 --> 01:08:22,342
What are we doing about Mexico?

827
01:08:22,426 --> 01:08:25,679
- Come on, guys, out of the box.
- Unlimited funds?

828
01:08:25,763 --> 01:08:27,890
Unlimited.

829
01:08:28,015 --> 01:08:31,852
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

830
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:35,606
And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.

831
01:08:35,731 --> 01:08:37,649
Come on, guys,
I want to hear from everyone:

832
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:40,527
F.B.I., customs, treatment.

833
01:08:42,112 --> 01:08:44,239
- Is there anybody from treatment
on this plane?
- No, Judge.

834
01:08:44,364 --> 01:08:47,410
Then, I want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

835
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:49,496
Yes, sir.

836
01:08:49,621 --> 01:08:53,583
We need to take down one of
these cartels--Juarez or Tijuana--

837
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:55,752
not because they're a symbol, but--

838
01:08:55,877 --> 01:09:00,799
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

839
01:09:00,924 --> 01:09:04,594
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense,

840
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,764
I send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

841
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:10,809
Why? Because it's a symbol.

842
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:14,104
It's a symbol that
we are sending the best.

843
01:09:14,187 --> 01:09:18,733
It's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

844
01:09:18,817 --> 01:09:21,319
So...

845
01:09:21,403 --> 01:09:23,446
right now...

846
01:09:23,571 --> 01:09:27,117
on this flight only...

847
01:09:27,242 --> 01:09:29,661
the dam is open...

848
01:09:29,744 --> 01:09:32,956
for new ideas.

849
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:45,803
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

850
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:49,473
I have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

851
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:53,519
I learned that back
in Miami in '85.

852
01:09:53,602 --> 01:09:55,646
U.S. shut down
the entire Caribbean.

853
01:09:55,771 --> 01:10:00,067
- It's a big game of whack-a-mole.
You knock it down in Miami--
- Arnie, I need money.

854
01:10:00,192 --> 01:10:03,487
Somebody-- I think it was the Obregons--
threatened David.

855
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:06,866
They want a first payment
of $3 million.

856
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:10,161
Oh, Helena.

857
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:13,664
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I
just don't have that kind of money.

858
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:15,666
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

859
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:20,337
Yes, there are people that do owe
you money, but nobody's gonna pay.

860
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:23,299
Carl's got too much heat on him.

861
01:10:23,382 --> 01:10:27,511
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

862
01:10:27,636 --> 01:10:31,558
- Don't we own a construction--
- Laundromats wash the money.

863
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:33,852
Just tell me something
positive, Arnie.

864
01:10:33,977 --> 01:10:36,688
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

865
01:10:36,772 --> 01:10:38,732
I'm sorry.

866
01:10:43,695 --> 01:10:46,698
I just keep wondering what's
gonna happen if he doesn't get out.

867
01:10:46,823 --> 01:10:50,285
Just never been
on my own before.

868
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:54,039
Always had someone. Always.

869
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:06,551
I remember the first time
that I saw you--

870
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:11,598
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

871
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:17,521
Somehow I knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

872
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:21,233
Glad you think so, Arnie.

873
01:11:21,316 --> 01:11:26,030
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

874
01:11:26,114 --> 01:11:30,243
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

875
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:36,249
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone like that.

876
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:39,585
Do you?

877
01:11:39,877 --> 01:11:40,670
Do you?

878
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:17,040
You two don't like me, do you?

879
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,754
Miss, with all due respect,
we don't have an opinion.

880
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,964
Maybe it's because
I'm going to have...

881
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,133
the nicest home you've ever seen
in your miserable lives.

882
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,888
The old man actually
kept his promise.

883
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,309
The general is a man of his word.

884
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:40,189
They will say anything
to get what they want...

885
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:45,486
and then it's always
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

886
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:48,781
Occupational hazard, I guess.

887
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,974
- The bags?

888
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:22,524
-My love, it's beautiful! How beautiful!

889
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:25,026
How are you feeling? Good?

890
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,780
How handsome you are.

891
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,041
Listen...

892
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,544
the Scorpion is alive.

893
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,506
Get in.

894
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:53,930
Porfirio Madrigal
isn't dead after all!

895
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:58,393
That means that Salazar is working
for the Juárez cartel.

896
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,773
I can't believe
this doesn't matter to you.

897
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,068
This is nothing new, Manolo.

898
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:09,697
That's why Salazar is so interested
in cleaning up Tijuana.

899
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,450
And he has plans for Juan Obregón,
the bastard.

900
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:15,703
That's right.

901
01:14:17,413 --> 01:14:20,916
You know how much money
he would pay for this information?

902
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,003
- How much?
- A fuckload of money, partner.

903
01:14:28,716 --> 01:14:33,262
- What's up, man?
- Take off your glasses.

904
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:36,557
Take off your glasses
so I can see your eyes.

905
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:49,612
We're going to keep
our mouths shut.

906
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:54,618
Okay.

907
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:05,128
I think we
may have found our Mexican drug czar.

908
01:15:05,253 --> 01:15:08,173
General Salazar.

909
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:10,801
Be nice to have somebody
to workwith down there.

910
01:15:12,094 --> 01:15:15,305
Does this mean you're
gonna be gone more?

911
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,641
Possibly, yeah.

912
01:15:19,851 --> 01:15:23,814
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

913
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:26,650
- Barbara--
- Because I'm at the edge
of my capabilities, Robert.

914
01:15:26,775 --> 01:15:29,945
I think it's important
we maintain a unified front.

915
01:15:30,028 --> 01:15:32,155
If you start in
on the war metaphors,

916
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,324
I'm gonna drive this car
into a telephone pole.

917
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:37,994
- I am as worried as you are.
- Oh, I don't think so.

918
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,038
"Leave me alone.
Give me some money."

919
01:15:40,122 --> 01:15:42,499
That's what I get
from our daughter.

920
01:15:42,582 --> 01:15:46,129
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

921
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:51,175
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

922
01:15:53,553 --> 01:15:55,555
I'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

923
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:57,557
just to walk in the house
and say hello.

924
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,852
I have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. It's different.

925
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:05,189
-Oh, is it?
-Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.

926
01:16:21,914 --> 01:16:25,752
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

927
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:25,437
Caroline, open this door immediately.

928
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:28,732
Who is it?
I'm going to the bathroom.

929
01:17:28,816 --> 01:17:31,194
- Open the goddamn door!
- One minute.

930
01:17:38,243 --> 01:17:40,453
Excuse me.
I have to go to bed.

931
01:17:43,665 --> 01:17:46,209
Oh, Jesus.

932
01:17:51,256 --> 01:17:53,675
You are not going anywhere, young lady.

933
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:56,970
You stay right there.

934
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:04,686
Where are they?

935
01:18:05,937 --> 01:18:07,856
Where the hell are the drugs?

936
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:09,983
Where are they?

937
01:18:10,108 --> 01:18:12,026
Fuck you.

938
01:18:12,152 --> 01:18:14,112
Fuck you.

939
01:18:14,195 --> 01:18:18,324
I wasn't doing anything.
You're like the Gestapo.

940
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:22,872
Fuck me. Fuck me.
Well, fuck you!

941
01:19:12,421 --> 01:19:14,632
- Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

942
01:19:14,757 --> 01:19:17,886
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

943
01:19:18,011 --> 01:19:20,222
- Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

944
01:19:20,347 --> 01:19:22,265
- You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

945
01:19:22,349 --> 01:19:24,768
- Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

946
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:27,771
- Somewhere safe.
- Where?

947
01:19:27,854 --> 01:19:30,565
A place we have that we know
is protected. He's good. Let's go.

948
01:19:30,649 --> 01:19:32,859
- No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. It's really safe.

949
01:19:32,943 --> 01:19:35,654
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

950
01:19:35,779 --> 01:19:38,240
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

951
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:41,076
- This is safe.
- Come on.

952
01:19:41,201 --> 01:19:43,620
Allright.

953
01:19:43,703 --> 01:19:46,248
Where would you like to go?

954
01:19:46,331 --> 01:19:49,668
- Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

955
01:19:58,635 --> 01:20:03,348
I believe it's
important that we work together.

956
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:07,102
Mexico and the United States.
One hand washing the other.

957
01:20:07,227 --> 01:20:10,106
We agree.

958
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:13,192
So, maybe you can tell me
about your informants in our operations.

959
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:19,449
We thought that maybe you'd have
that kind of information for us.

960
01:20:20,908 --> 01:20:24,954
This is a very different
proposition, my friend.

961
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:28,124
We pay for that kind
of information.

962
01:20:28,249 --> 01:20:31,794
Is that what
you're talking about, Javier?

963
01:20:31,878 --> 01:20:33,963
Getting paid?

964
01:20:37,425 --> 01:20:39,385
You like baseball?

965
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:47,643
We need lights for the parks
so kids can play at night.

966
01:20:48,936 --> 01:20:51,355
So it's safe.

967
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:54,442
So they can play baseball.

968
01:20:54,525 --> 01:20:57,528
So they no become--

969
01:20:57,612 --> 01:20:59,530
Everybody like baseball.

970
01:20:59,614 --> 01:21:02,618
Everybody likes parks.

971
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:06,080
Listen.

972
01:21:06,205 --> 01:21:10,167
I believe it's important that
the United State take an interest...

973
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,336
in Tijuana now.

974
01:21:14,463 --> 01:21:17,925
That's what I'm talking about,
my friends.

975
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:20,511
Accountnumber...

976
01:21:20,636 --> 01:21:25,682
8201-4302-8091...

977
01:21:25,808 --> 01:21:28,018
2431.

978
01:21:29,812 --> 01:21:31,855
A cash advance.

979
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:40,405
How much can I get?

980
01:21:42,866 --> 01:21:44,785
That's it?

981
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:50,874
You ever try the patch, man?

982
01:21:50,999 --> 01:21:52,919
- The what?
- The patch.

983
01:21:53,002 --> 01:21:56,714
- That shit doesn't work, bro.
- It worked for my cousin.

984
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,717
- No shit?
- Yeah.

985
01:21:59,801 --> 01:22:02,387
He had to wear five or six
at a time, but it worked.

986
01:22:02,512 --> 01:22:04,931
- So, how's he doing now?
- Oh, he's dead.

987
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:09,519
- He's dead?
- It wasn't from the patch, man.

988
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:12,230
- Okay, she's coming out.
- On it.

989
01:22:12,355 --> 01:22:15,275
- What did he die from?
- His wife shot him.

990
01:22:15,358 --> 01:22:18,987
She's leaving her property.

991
01:22:19,112 --> 01:22:20,905
Where the hell is she going?

992
01:22:21,197 --> 01:22:23,116
Maybe her neighbors.

993
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:26,411
No, I don't think the neighbors
are fucking with her too much
right about now.

994
01:22:26,536 --> 01:22:29,080
What does she have
in her hand there?

995
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:35,086
She seems to be headed for the van.

996
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:42,469
Oh, shit.

997
01:22:42,552 --> 01:22:46,599
- What-- Wh-What do we do?
- I-l don't know. What do we do?

998
01:22:46,682 --> 01:22:48,559
- What do you think she wants, man?
- She's your girlfriend.

999
01:22:48,642 --> 01:22:50,644
You think she'll invite you
to her baby shower?

1000
01:22:50,728 --> 01:22:52,646
-Just say hello. Work it.
- All right, all right, all right.

1001
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:54,940
She's waiting outside the van.

1002
01:22:55,065 --> 01:22:57,610
- Hello?
- Would you like some lemonade?

1003
01:22:57,735 --> 01:23:01,781
- I was just making some.
- You want some lemonade?

1004
01:23:01,906 --> 01:23:03,824
Sure.

1005
01:23:03,908 --> 01:23:08,120
I knowt his is a difficult situation,
and you're only doing your jobs.

1006
01:23:08,245 --> 01:23:11,665
I don't wish you guys
any ill will or anything like that.

1007
01:23:11,749 --> 01:23:13,876
But I have a favor to ask you.

1008
01:23:14,001 --> 01:23:16,128
You're asking us for a favor?

1009
01:23:16,253 --> 01:23:18,464
Some man threatened my child.

1010
01:23:18,589 --> 01:23:20,508
These charges have created
so much attention,

1011
01:23:20,591 --> 01:23:24,637
it seems to be bringing
all the nutjobs out of the nutjar.

1012
01:23:24,762 --> 01:23:27,681
Would you keep an eye out
for anything out of the ordinary?

1013
01:23:28,849 --> 01:23:31,185
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

1014
01:23:31,268 --> 01:23:33,813
- I'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

1015
01:23:33,938 --> 01:23:36,524
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

1016
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:39,027
You're welcome.

1017
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:49,037
I'm gonna get this analyzed
right away, bro.

1018
01:23:51,873 --> 01:23:54,876
So, it was my birthday...

1019
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:57,879
and my ex-wife
was getting remarried...

1020
01:23:57,963 --> 01:24:00,882
and I was in some church basement
telling a bunch of strangers...

1021
01:24:00,966 --> 01:24:02,926
it was a good day because...

1022
01:24:03,051 --> 01:24:05,387
I didn't have to eat
out of a Dumpster.

1023
01:24:06,805 --> 01:24:09,724
That was enough to send me
out on a pretty big one.

1024
01:24:09,808 --> 01:24:13,228
I've been thinking a lot
about the first step--

1025
01:24:13,311 --> 01:24:17,023
that I came to believe
I was powerless over alcohol...

1026
01:24:17,149 --> 01:24:19,192
and that my life
had become unmanageable.

1027
01:24:19,317 --> 01:24:22,737
My disease tells me
that I don't have a disease,

1028
01:24:22,821 --> 01:24:25,365
that it's my birthday
and I can have one little beer,

1029
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:29,202
one little line,
a little Valium.

1030
01:24:29,327 --> 01:24:33,875
Six months later, I wake up
in a sober-living house in Philly.

1031
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,544
I'm from Dallas, people.

1032
01:24:36,669 --> 01:24:40,214
It's a disease,
an allergy of the body,

1033
01:24:40,339 --> 01:24:42,759
an obsession of the mind.

1034
01:24:42,842 --> 01:24:45,052
So, my name is Marty,

1035
01:24:45,178 --> 01:24:49,223
and today I'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

1036
01:24:49,348 --> 01:24:54,395
And it's a good day because I
didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

1037
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,439
Thanks.

1038
01:24:58,858 --> 01:25:01,068
Hi.

1039
01:25:02,528 --> 01:25:07,074
I'm Caroline.
I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.

1040
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,746
I mean...
I don't really like to drink.

1041
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:18,586
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

1042
01:25:23,217 --> 01:25:26,637
I guess I'm angry.

1043
01:25:30,057 --> 01:25:33,602
I mean, I think I'm really angry
about a lot of stuff.

1044
01:25:33,727 --> 01:25:37,648
I'm just... not sure what.

1045
01:26:24,863 --> 01:26:27,198
Listen to me.
I built our house...

1046
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:29,451
and I'm not gonna lose it.

1047
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:34,247
My business--

1048
01:26:34,372 --> 01:26:39,711
that would take a lot
of private study.

1049
01:26:45,508 --> 01:26:49,512
I suggest...
you look into the Coronel.

1050
01:26:49,596 --> 01:26:54,350
- The painting?
- Into selling it.

1051
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,603
If you can stomach it,

1052
01:26:56,728 --> 01:27:00,398
you should look into it.

1053
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:47,947
Oh, my God.

1054
01:28:44,588 --> 01:28:47,549
Dear Judge,

1055
01:28:47,674 --> 01:28:51,636
I recruited the best men
in Mexico for my task force.

1056
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:56,976
I make the selection, putting them
under a rigorous screening process.

1057
01:28:57,059 --> 01:29:01,647
And not only physically,
but also psychologically.

1058
01:29:01,731 --> 01:29:05,777
Judge, I'm sorry for boxes
and the paintings and things,

1059
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:10,031
but I have been too busy
to completely settle in here.

1060
01:29:10,156 --> 01:29:12,825
I know you've made very good progress
with the Tijuana cartel.

1061
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:15,161
- Congratulations, General.
- Muchas gracias.

1062
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:19,457
I am confident
that before the end of the year,

1063
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:22,835
Juan Obregon is gonna
be taken into custody.

1064
01:29:22,919 --> 01:29:27,673
But you must understand that it's
going to be a very difficult task...

1065
01:29:27,799 --> 01:29:31,427
because of the corruption
in the police force.

1066
01:29:31,552 --> 01:29:34,889
Hopefully, the exchange
of training methods and information...

1067
01:29:34,972 --> 01:29:37,225
between our two countries will help.

1068
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:39,519
I hope so.

1069
01:29:39,644 --> 01:29:43,481
On another note, General,
we were talking about supply.

1070
01:29:43,564 --> 01:29:46,360
- Mm-hmm.
- What about demand?

1071
01:29:46,485 --> 01:29:49,446
What are your policies
towards treatment of addiction?

1072
01:29:49,571 --> 01:29:52,699
"Treatment of addiction."

1073
01:29:52,783 --> 01:29:55,035
Addicts treat themselves.

1074
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,248
They overdose, and then there's
one less to worry about.

1075
01:30:05,003 --> 01:30:09,675
What I want you to do right now
is write down five triggers...

1076
01:30:09,758 --> 01:30:11,885
that could lead
to your relapse,

1077
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:14,430
that could jeopardize
your recovery.

1078
01:30:14,513 --> 01:30:19,435
Five triggers.
Your parents, something they could say.

1079
01:30:19,518 --> 01:30:22,396
Anything that's a trigger for you.
It varies from person to person.

1080
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:26,900
Some of us
have already discussed--

1081
01:30:26,984 --> 01:30:29,069
Linda, we talked about it
the other day.

1082
01:30:29,194 --> 01:30:31,113
I know you have trouble
with your sister,

1083
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:35,033
how she's always
kind of outshining you.

1084
01:30:43,793 --> 01:30:46,629
Hey, sugarfoot,
how do you like your new home?

1085
01:30:49,674 --> 01:30:53,636
- You got to be kidding me.
This is not what my lawyers negotiated.

1086
01:30:53,762 --> 01:30:55,638
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

1087
01:30:55,764 --> 01:30:58,475
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or--

1088
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,478
- Biscotti.
- Yeah, you ain't getting
none of that shit either.

1089
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:03,646
- Pick a bed.
- Stay off the phone, Eddie.

1090
01:31:03,772 --> 01:31:05,690
No long-distance calls, all right?

1091
01:31:05,815 --> 01:31:08,902
- Use 1-800-CRIMINAL if you do.

1092
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:20,121
Mr. Ayala first came
to see me in January.

1093
01:31:20,205 --> 01:31:23,333
That would have been 1987.

1094
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:26,795
He wanted to rent warehouse space
along the harbor.

1095
01:31:26,878 --> 01:31:31,008
I didn't ask too many questions.
I am a businessman also.

1096
01:31:31,133 --> 01:31:35,679
I was the company's secretary
from 1991 to 1994.

1097
01:31:35,805 --> 01:31:40,017
I supposedly worked for all
six companies, but they weren't--

1098
01:31:40,142 --> 01:31:44,355
I mean, it was just an empty office
with a desk and a telephone.

1099
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,399
I never sold anything
the whole time I was there.

1100
01:31:47,525 --> 01:31:50,820
Sometimes people came in,
and they got paid.

1101
01:31:50,903 --> 01:31:53,697
I-I don't really know
what they did.

1102
01:31:53,823 --> 01:31:58,536
- Didn't Mr. Ayala
say where the money came from?
- No.

1103
01:31:58,661 --> 01:32:03,707
-Did you ask where the money came from?
-No.

1104
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:05,876
Where do you think it came from?

1105
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:08,379
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

1106
01:32:08,462 --> 01:32:10,881
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

1107
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:16,011
Did you feel like you were engaged
in a legitimate enterprise?

1108
01:32:17,721 --> 01:32:20,724
No, not really.

1109
01:32:23,478 --> 01:32:25,397
Thank you.

1110
01:32:52,215 --> 01:32:54,926
You were followed by the police,

1111
01:32:55,051 --> 01:32:59,848
but they won't be able
to hear us over the children.

1112
01:33:01,933 --> 01:33:05,437
I want to use a bomb.

1113
01:33:08,774 --> 01:33:10,776
Are you kidding?

1114
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:13,612
Can't you just shoot him
or something?

1115
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:17,450
I don't really like guns.

1116
01:33:17,575 --> 01:33:19,952
You shoot somebody in the head
two, three times...

1117
01:33:20,077 --> 01:33:24,749
and some pinche doctor
is trying to keep him alive.

1118
01:33:26,793 --> 01:33:29,796
When are you gonna do it?

1119
01:33:29,921 --> 01:33:31,798
I don't know.

1120
01:33:34,425 --> 01:33:39,055
Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl.

1121
01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:41,099
Security will be very tight.

1122
01:33:43,434 --> 01:33:48,731
- I may not be able to get to him.
- You'll be able to get to him.

1123
01:33:48,815 --> 01:33:52,485
If they can get to
the pope and the president,
you can certainly get to him.

1124
01:33:54,612 --> 01:33:59,158
Careful. You're starting to sound
like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

1125
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:23,684
Nobody saw her leave?

1126
01:34:23,809 --> 01:34:26,186
Hmm.

1127
01:34:26,311 --> 01:34:28,689
No, I understand.

1128
01:34:28,814 --> 01:34:31,358
Okay.

1129
01:34:34,403 --> 01:34:36,864
I gotta go.

1130
01:34:36,989 --> 01:34:39,867
I've got to go home.

1131
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:42,870
Did you want me to resch--

1132
01:34:42,995 --> 01:34:45,497
Fine.

1133
01:34:58,887 --> 01:35:02,265
What's going on? You seem nervous.

1134
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:04,642
- Because of Manolo.

1135
01:35:04,726 --> 01:35:08,062
I'm afraid he'll do something foolish
and it's going to get him killed.

1136
01:35:08,146 --> 01:35:09,647
Why?

1137
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:12,692
He says he's going
to sell information to the DEA.

1138
01:35:12,776 --> 01:35:15,862
They're going to pay him
a lot of money.

1139
01:35:18,281 --> 01:35:21,201
What could he tell the DEA?

1140
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:23,328
You know...

1141
01:35:23,411 --> 01:35:25,413
about Salazar and Madrigal.

1142
01:35:34,714 --> 01:35:36,591
Javier.

1143
01:35:40,095 --> 01:35:42,222
Where is he right now?

1144
01:35:43,264 --> 01:35:47,310
I don't know.
He took his passport and left.

1145
01:35:51,774 --> 01:35:54,110
Give me a kiss.

1146
01:35:54,193 --> 01:35:55,277
Don't tell him that I told you.

1147
01:35:55,402 --> 01:35:57,279
No.

1148
01:36:27,059 --> 01:36:30,813
What you want? Pot? Rock?
Hey, what you want?

1149
01:37:19,488 --> 01:37:22,699
- Fuck!

1150
01:37:39,175 --> 01:37:41,719
What the fuck do you want?

1151
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,416
Yeah.

1152
01:40:27,221 --> 01:40:30,724
It has come to our attention that
Your Honor, while in private practice,

1153
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:33,060
previously represented
the town of Seal Beach...

1154
01:40:33,185 --> 01:40:36,063
in their stop-work suit against
the police department of Seal Beach.

1155
01:40:36,188 --> 01:40:38,732
We believe this disqualifies you
from hearing this case,

1156
01:40:38,858 --> 01:40:42,778
and we, therefore, move for a temporary
suspension until it's investigated.

1157
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:45,030
Mr. Adler, this is
a most unusual motion.

1158
01:40:45,156 --> 01:40:47,074
Nonetheless, Your Honor,

1159
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:50,411
we feel our client deserves
every fairness afforded under the law.

1160
01:40:50,536 --> 01:40:55,541
I hope this is not in anyway designed
to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

1161
01:41:00,212 --> 01:41:02,882
We will recess until 9:00 a.m.
on Monday morning,

1162
01:41:02,965 --> 01:41:07,053
and I will see counsel
in my chambers.

1163
01:41:23,737 --> 01:41:26,114
They are coming this way.

1164
01:41:29,534 --> 01:41:32,204
All of them are there.

1165
01:41:32,329 --> 01:41:35,040
They are passing me now.

1166
01:41:40,921 --> 01:41:43,882
Boy, there's a lot of them.

1167
01:41:43,965 --> 01:41:48,804
Listen, would you mind if we
walked back to the hotel today?

1168
01:41:48,887 --> 01:41:51,640
- Walk back?
- Yeah.

1169
01:41:55,602 --> 01:41:57,771
They're not getting into the car.

1170
01:41:59,273 --> 01:42:01,609
What are they doing?

1171
01:42:01,692 --> 01:42:03,945
They're arguing or something.

1172
01:42:06,823 --> 01:42:09,158
It's two blocks.
I could use the fresh air.

1173
01:42:09,283 --> 01:42:11,744
I've been stuck in that piece of shit
hotel room for two weeks.

1174
01:42:11,828 --> 01:42:14,455
I don't give a fuck.
Let's just stop standing around.

1175
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:16,666
- I want to walk 'cause I want to walk,
not 'cause he wants to walk.
- Let's walk.

1176
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:18,709
I like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

1177
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:23,923
They're going past me.

1178
01:42:27,635 --> 01:42:32,140
I-I-I do not know. I think
they're going back to the courthouse.

1179
01:42:32,223 --> 01:42:37,228
This could be the last chance
to do this! Get out of the car
and shoot him in the head!

1180
01:42:56,415 --> 01:42:58,375
You're a fucking big man?

1181
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:03,755
I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking
deal drugs to little fucking kids, you--

1182
01:43:07,468 --> 01:43:09,011
Fucking rat.

1183
01:43:09,136 --> 01:43:12,097
- You think you're a badass?
- I am a badass!

1184
01:43:14,016 --> 01:43:17,644
Move, move! Get down!

1185
01:43:25,277 --> 01:43:27,988
- Go, go, go!
We need an ambulance.
- Go, go, go.

1186
01:43:56,893 --> 01:43:59,646
Ray. Ray! Ray!
Wait a minute, Ray!

1187
01:44:46,944 --> 01:44:49,321
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

1188
01:44:49,697 --> 01:44:51,824
What's up, Manolo?

1189
01:44:53,826 --> 01:44:56,454
Looks like you're waiting
for someone.

1190
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:58,622
I'm just looking for the waitress.

1191
01:44:59,331 --> 01:45:01,625
I'm ready to order.
Do you want anything?

1192
01:45:01,709 --> 01:45:04,587
A fucking salad?
Something to drink?

1193
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:07,631
No, no. Calm down, calm down.

1194
01:45:07,715 --> 01:45:11,719
What are you gonna have, Manolito?

1195
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:16,474
A steak.

1196
01:45:18,517 --> 01:45:20,644
Well, if you like steak...

1197
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:23,272
we know a much better place.

1198
01:45:23,647 --> 01:45:26,066
You come with us.

1199
01:45:54,387 --> 01:45:57,224
Javier had nothing to do with this.

1200
01:45:58,558 --> 01:46:01,061
It was all my idea.

1201
01:46:04,231 --> 01:46:06,691
Punish me, not him.

1202
01:46:11,446 --> 01:46:13,907
Do me a favor.

1203
01:46:17,077 --> 01:46:19,496
Don't tell Ana I died like this.

1204
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:25,211
Tell her it was something else.

1205
01:46:26,587 --> 01:46:29,215
Something official.

1206
01:46:34,428 --> 01:46:36,931
Tell her I died
doing something worthy.

1207
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:42,478
Forgive me, Javi.

1208
01:46:49,944 --> 01:46:52,363
Put some muscle into it.

1209
01:46:53,448 --> 01:46:55,491
You too, Manolo.

1210
01:47:02,999 --> 01:47:05,376
You're done.

1211
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,378
- Get out of there.
- Don't you hear?

1212
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:10,756
Javier, put the shovel down.

1213
01:47:12,383 --> 01:47:15,012
Get out. Let's go.

1214
01:47:16,513 --> 01:47:19,099
I told you it wasn't his fault.

1215
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:20,934
Shut up.

1216
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:27,524
Turn around.

1217
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:45,334
Let's go, Javier. It's over.

1218
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:05,187
Don't be alarmed, Javier.

1219
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:07,607
The old man works like this.

1220
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:10,819
We had to go
through the same thing.

1221
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:16,116
We had to do this
to be sure we could trust you.

1222
01:48:16,491 --> 01:48:18,493
Now we see that we can.

1223
01:48:18,618 --> 01:48:21,371
We are family now.

1224
01:49:24,101 --> 01:49:26,437
Sorry about the other night.

1225
01:49:28,397 --> 01:49:30,274
Me too.

1226
01:51:38,489 --> 01:51:44,203
Thank you for coming down here, though I
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

1227
01:51:44,328 --> 01:51:48,332
- Why would you say that?
- Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.

1228
01:51:48,415 --> 01:51:51,752
Your husband in jail,
his business in chaos,

1229
01:51:51,835 --> 01:51:54,963
various people fighting
over the scraps.

1230
01:51:55,088 --> 01:51:58,842
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

1231
01:51:58,926 --> 01:52:01,553
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

1232
01:52:01,678 --> 01:52:04,473
Your route has been compromised.

1233
01:52:04,598 --> 01:52:07,976
Perhaps it is time for me to deal
with other distributors in California.

1234
01:52:08,102 --> 01:52:10,229
- I don't think you're gonna do that.
- You don't?

1235
01:52:10,354 --> 01:52:13,065
- No.

1236
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:17,903
My husband was working on something
he called the Project for the Children.

1237
01:52:18,028 --> 01:52:23,909
- Are you aware of this?
- I don't know.
Perhaps I remember something.

1238
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:31,918
If you want to smuggle narcotics
in Senor Espastico Jacobo,

1239
01:52:32,043 --> 01:52:34,254
that is nothing new, Senora.

1240
01:52:34,379 --> 01:52:38,091
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

1241
01:52:38,216 --> 01:52:42,137
High impact,
pressure-molded cocaine.

1242
01:52:44,055 --> 01:52:47,100
It's odorless,
undetectable by the dogs.

1243
01:52:47,225 --> 01:52:50,145
- Undetectable by anyone.

1244
01:52:50,228 --> 01:52:52,480
I don't believe you, senora.

1245
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,382
I'm six months pregnant.

1246
01:53:19,507 --> 01:53:21,427
I won't do it.

1247
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:24,847
- Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

1248
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:27,349
We don't have a deal.

1249
01:53:28,517 --> 01:53:31,979
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregon.

1250
01:53:33,606 --> 01:53:35,524
Okay.

1251
01:53:35,608 --> 01:53:37,526
Okay, okay.

1252
01:53:46,786 --> 01:53:50,164
- That's good coke.
- It should be. It's yours.

1253
01:53:52,041 --> 01:53:53,918
I want our debt forgiven,

1254
01:53:54,043 --> 01:53:58,506
I want to be the exclusive
distributor of Obregon brothers'
cocaine in the United States,

1255
01:53:58,631 --> 01:54:03,385
and I want the principal witness against
my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

1256
01:54:10,309 --> 01:54:13,271
Have you told the complete truth
during this interview?

1257
01:54:15,482 --> 01:54:18,235
Yes.

1258
01:54:19,402 --> 01:54:22,030
- Alex?
- Solid.

1259
01:54:22,155 --> 01:54:24,574
- That's good shit, Javier.
- You know, Javier,

1260
01:54:24,658 --> 01:54:27,202
they dump those cell phones
every 24 hours.

1261
01:54:27,285 --> 01:54:30,872
Yes, but I have
a contact at MexTel...

1262
01:54:30,997 --> 01:54:35,210
who can get me
his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

1263
01:54:35,293 --> 01:54:37,254
That's good to know.

1264
01:54:41,341 --> 01:54:44,261
So, now that you have
what you want,

1265
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:47,556
let's talk about how
I get what I want.

1266
01:54:47,681 --> 01:54:49,891
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

1267
01:54:50,016 --> 01:54:52,727
You're not gonna have
any problems there.

1268
01:54:52,853 --> 01:54:57,232
Yeah, but first let's talk
about what precautions you're
taking to protect yourself.

1269
01:54:57,315 --> 01:55:01,278
You worry about getting me
what I want.

1270
01:55:01,403 --> 01:55:03,780
I'll worry about myself.

1271
01:55:08,453 --> 01:55:12,915
Oye, Javier,
you should feel good about this.

1272
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:18,629
I feel like a traitor.

1273
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:49,012
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.

1274
01:56:49,138 --> 01:56:51,182
- Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

1275
01:56:51,307 --> 01:56:55,728
She was clean,
and she's back in San Diego now.

1276
01:56:55,812 --> 01:56:57,730
Okay.

1277
01:57:07,991 --> 01:57:11,703
- Hello?
- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.

1278
01:57:11,828 --> 01:57:14,038
- D-Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1279
01:57:14,164 --> 01:57:16,207
General Salazar has been arrested.

1280
01:57:16,332 --> 01:57:18,751
It turns out he has been working
for Porfirio Madrigal...

1281
01:57:18,835 --> 01:57:20,879
and the Juarez cartel
the entire time.

1282
01:57:21,004 --> 01:57:24,215
That is why he was trying to push
the Obregons out of Tijuana...

1283
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:26,551
- so he and Madrigal could move in.
- What?

1284
01:57:26,676 --> 01:57:29,679
I thought Madrigal was dead.
I thought that had been verified.

1285
01:57:29,762 --> 01:57:33,057
Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,

1286
01:57:33,183 --> 01:57:37,228
but the D.E.A. supplied the information
and was part of the sting.

1287
01:57:37,353 --> 01:57:40,774
So, maybe we can spin this a little,
but I don't know what to tell people.

1288
01:57:40,857 --> 01:57:44,069
-So, when are you coming back?
-I'll try to get there as soon as I can.

1289
01:57:44,195 --> 01:57:46,405
- Yeah, okay, but--
- Robert.

1290
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:50,951
Robert? Robert?

1291
01:57:51,035 --> 01:57:53,245
I gotta call you back.

1292
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:55,289
- What--

1293
01:57:59,877 --> 01:58:04,924
- My Leica's missing.
- She got the video camera too.

1294
01:58:05,049 --> 01:58:08,093
At least we know she's still alive.
Where are you going?

1295
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:12,264
Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes
after that, she'll be at her dealer.

1296
01:58:12,389 --> 01:58:15,935
If I can find him,
I should be able to find her.

1297
01:58:25,653 --> 01:58:29,782
Although
ser and estar both mean "to be,"

1298
01:58:29,907 --> 01:58:33,786
they have very specific uses.

1299
01:58:33,869 --> 01:58:36,832
May I help you, sir?

1300
01:58:41,670 --> 01:58:43,463
Excuse me!

1301
01:58:43,588 --> 01:58:47,008
Seth has to be excused.
He's going on a field trip.

1302
01:58:53,098 --> 01:58:56,810
I can't believe you brought
my daughter to this place.

1303
01:58:58,603 --> 01:59:03,316
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just
back the fuck up, man?

1304
01:59:03,442 --> 01:59:05,485
"To this place"?

1305
01:59:05,610 --> 01:59:07,821
What is that shit?

1306
01:59:07,946 --> 01:59:10,866
Okay, right now, all over
this great nation of ours,

1307
01:59:10,949 --> 01:59:13,660
100,000 white people from the suburbs
are cruising around downtown...

1308
01:59:13,785 --> 01:59:17,497
asking every black person,
"You got any drugs? You know
where I can score some drugs?"

1309
01:59:17,622 --> 01:59:21,543
Think about the effect that has
on the psyche of a black person,
on their possibilities.

1310
01:59:21,626 --> 01:59:25,672
I-- God, I guarantee you,
you bring 100,000 black people
into your neighborhood,

1311
01:59:25,755 --> 01:59:30,011
and they're asking every white
person, "You got any drugs?
Know where I can score some?"

1312
01:59:30,136 --> 01:59:34,348
Within a day, everyone would be
selling--your friends, their kids.

1313
01:59:34,474 --> 01:59:38,186
Here's why: It's an unbeatable market
force, man. It's a 300% markup value.

1314
01:59:38,311 --> 01:59:41,147
You can go out on the street
and make $500 in two hours,

1315
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:43,232
come back and do whatever you want
with the rest of your day.

1316
01:59:43,316 --> 01:59:47,904
You're telling me that white people
would still be going to law school?

1317
02:00:12,678 --> 02:00:15,890
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

1318
02:00:15,973 --> 02:00:17,892
Caroline.

1319
02:00:17,975 --> 02:00:20,437
She's been here.

1320
02:00:20,521 --> 02:00:22,564
This is a business, man.
Why don't you get the fuck out ofhere?

1321
02:00:22,689 --> 02:00:26,610
I need to find my daughter, all right?
I'll pay you.

1322
02:00:27,694 --> 02:00:30,906
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

1323
02:00:34,034 --> 02:00:38,247
Who in the fuck do you think you are?
Where the fuck do you think you are?

1324
02:00:38,372 --> 02:00:43,418
- Why the fuck shouldn't I just
put your ass in a Dumpster?
- I got money.

1325
02:00:43,544 --> 02:00:46,088
- I got money!
- I got $1,000 in my wallet.

1326
02:00:46,213 --> 02:00:50,259
- It's for you.
- If I want your money, man,
I will take your money.

1327
02:00:52,553 --> 02:00:55,097
Just tell me
where my daughter is.

1328
02:00:55,222 --> 02:00:57,683
Please? Please?

1329
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:05,441
Don't do that shit again.

1330
02:01:11,906 --> 02:01:16,619
Look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you,
don't do this vigilante thing.

1331
02:01:16,744 --> 02:01:19,789
Either the cops are gonna find her,
or she's gonna call you.

1332
02:01:19,914 --> 02:01:21,833
Okay?

1333
02:01:21,916 --> 02:01:23,835
I promise.

1334
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:54,157
Ana.

1335
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:58,536
If Manolo hadn't done what he did...

1336
02:01:59,454 --> 02:02:03,833
they wouldn't have been able
to get Salazar and Madrigal.

1337
02:02:08,422 --> 02:02:11,008
He did something really good.

1338
02:02:14,053 --> 02:02:17,932
What's more, he did
something important for Tijuana.

1339
02:02:19,475 --> 02:02:21,894
I would like to believe you.

1340
02:02:29,527 --> 02:02:32,988
You don't have to believe me...

1341
02:02:35,116 --> 02:02:37,243
because it's the truth.

1342
02:02:38,494 --> 02:02:40,913
The simple truth.

1343
02:02:57,180 --> 02:02:59,891
Tomorrow I'm going
to burn his clothes.

1344
02:03:47,731 --> 02:03:50,902
I know she's in there.
Just let me talk to her.

1345
02:03:50,985 --> 02:03:53,780
Look, I know she's in there, man!

1346
02:03:53,905 --> 02:03:56,449
No, I fucking know she's in there!

1347
02:04:00,244 --> 02:04:02,413
Jesus Christ!

1348
02:04:02,497 --> 02:04:05,166
I-I haven't touched her.

1349
02:04:11,088 --> 02:04:14,300
You get the fuck
out of here right now.

1350
02:04:27,271 --> 02:04:29,190
Hi.

1351
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:37,990
Hi, Daddy.

1352
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,330
Hi, sweetheart.

1353
02:05:16,822 --> 02:05:20,033
Hey, good morning, Eddie.

1354
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,202
- Good morning.
- Big day.

1355
02:05:23,662 --> 02:05:28,208
You're a star.

1356
02:05:28,333 --> 02:05:30,752
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

1357
02:05:32,838 --> 02:05:36,509
- Who is it?
- It's the Mafia.

1358
02:05:36,593 --> 02:05:39,929
- I've got his breakfast.
- Coming.

1359
02:05:43,683 --> 02:05:45,602
- So who's this going to?
- Over here.

1360
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:56,321
- Ooh.
- Fuck off.

1361
02:05:56,446 --> 02:06:00,658
- Relax, Eddie.
- Yeah, where has the love gone?
Good-bye.

1362
02:06:02,535 --> 02:06:04,579
You know, you're gonna be testifying
for about ten days.

1363
02:06:04,704 --> 02:06:06,915
We could just decide
to stop feeding your ass.

1364
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:10,960
You expect me to be grateful
for spending the rest of my life
looking over my shoulder?

1365
02:06:11,044 --> 02:06:14,756
Wow, that's--
that's heavy, Eddie.

1366
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:21,262
Can't you for one second imagine
that none of this had happened,
that my drugs had gone through?

1367
02:06:21,387 --> 02:06:23,306
What would be the harm?

1368
02:06:23,389 --> 02:06:25,600
Huh? What would be the harm?

1369
02:06:25,725 --> 02:06:28,437
A few people get high
who are getting high anyway.

1370
02:06:28,562 --> 02:06:31,607
Your partner's still alive.

1371
02:06:31,732 --> 02:06:35,152
We don't have to have
breakfast together.

1372
02:06:35,236 --> 02:06:37,279
Don't you see this means nothing?

1373
02:06:37,404 --> 02:06:39,615
Your whole life is pointless.

1374
02:06:40,908 --> 02:06:43,327
You're really breaking my heart.

1375
02:06:45,246 --> 02:06:50,793
- The worst part about you, Monty--
- "Monty"?

1376
02:06:50,918 --> 02:06:52,837
The worst part about you, Monty,

1377
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:56,257
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

1378
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:59,135
Wish you could see
how transparent you are.

1379
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:01,387
This food tastes like shit.

1380
02:07:01,512 --> 02:07:05,307
So, take your stank ass
and go get a shower already.

1381
02:07:07,268 --> 02:07:09,186
Let me tell you something.

1382
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:12,189
You only got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

1383
02:07:12,273 --> 02:07:14,191
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

1384
02:07:14,275 --> 02:07:17,695
- You are helping them. Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

1385
02:07:17,778 --> 02:07:20,824
So, remember, you work
for a drug dealer too, Monty.

1386
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,202
- Fuck me.

1387
02:07:24,286 --> 02:07:27,205
- Who is it?
- Breakfast.

1388
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:31,710
Hurry up.
It's getting cold.

1389
02:07:36,423 --> 02:07:38,341
Okay. One second.

1390
02:07:39,593 --> 02:07:42,179
- Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1391
02:07:42,262 --> 02:07:45,849
- Get down! Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, I'm on your side!

1392
02:07:45,932 --> 02:07:49,102
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.

1393
02:07:49,227 --> 02:07:52,189
- Call an ambulance! Fuck!
- Palms up.
Spread your damn hands out.

1394
02:07:52,314 --> 02:07:55,358
- Shit! Eddie!

1395
02:07:57,903 --> 02:07:59,988
Hold on.

1396
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:03,283
Oh, shit!
Hurry up with that ambulance!

1397
02:08:03,408 --> 02:08:06,036
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

1398
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:12,543
Your Honor, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

1399
02:08:12,668 --> 02:08:16,589
because of the sudden death
of Eduardo Ruiz,

1400
02:08:16,672 --> 02:08:20,968
the people have determined
that we cannot continue our case
against Carl Ayala.

1401
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:26,432
Oh! Oh!

1402
02:08:28,935 --> 02:08:31,229
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

1403
02:10:16,628 --> 02:10:19,130
- Yeah?

1404
02:10:19,214 --> 02:10:21,216
Hi.

1405
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:25,720
I got a copy of your speech.

1406
02:10:25,804 --> 02:10:28,515
It's fantastic.

1407
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:31,184
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

1408
02:10:31,309 --> 02:10:33,436
You're my choice.
You're gonna be great.

1409
02:10:33,561 --> 02:10:36,356
The president's sorry he hasn't been
able to spend more time with you.

1410
02:10:36,481 --> 02:10:40,026
After the press conference,
he wants to really sit down.

1411
02:10:40,151 --> 02:10:44,364
Oh, and I got to the Post too.

1412
02:10:44,489 --> 02:10:47,200
Don't worry about that thing
with your daughter. It's not news.

1413
02:10:47,325 --> 02:10:51,539
They're willing to treat it
as a family matter, personal matter.

1414
02:10:51,664 --> 02:10:55,584
Anyway, if it came out,
we could turn it into a qualification.

1415
02:10:55,668 --> 02:10:57,711
"I've been in the trenches
of the drug war.

1416
02:10:57,837 --> 02:11:00,756
I've seen the face of the enemy.
Etcetera, etcetera. "

1417
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:05,678
A sterling reputation
and close friend of the president,

1418
02:11:05,761 --> 02:11:09,390
recently confirmed into the Office
of National Drug Control Policy,

1419
02:11:09,515 --> 02:11:14,228
our new drug czar,
Robert Hudson Wakefield.

1420
02:11:24,697 --> 02:11:28,242
The war on drugs is a war
that we have to win,

1421
02:11:28,367 --> 02:11:31,412
and a war that we can win.

1422
02:11:31,495 --> 02:11:37,251
We have to win this war to save
our country's most precious resource--

1423
02:11:37,376 --> 02:11:40,087
our children.

1424
02:11:40,171 --> 02:11:44,634
Sixty-eight million children
have been targeted...

1425
02:11:44,718 --> 02:11:47,762
by those who perpetrate this war...

1426
02:11:49,222 --> 02:11:54,186
and protecting these children
must be priority number one.

1427
02:11:57,898 --> 02:12:03,445
There has been progress,
and there has been failure.

1428
02:12:03,570 --> 02:12:06,907
But where we have fallen short,

1429
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:10,452
I see not a problem,

1430
02:12:10,577 --> 02:12:14,331
I see an opportunity.

1431
02:12:17,751 --> 02:12:20,796
An opportunity...

1432
02:12:20,921 --> 02:12:26,593
to correct the mistakes...
ofthe past...

1433
02:12:26,676 --> 02:12:31,139
while laying a foundation
for the future.

1434
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:39,190
This takes...

1435
02:12:39,273 --> 02:12:42,985
not only new ideas...

1436
02:12:43,110 --> 02:12:46,030
but perseverance.

1437
02:12:46,113 --> 02:12:51,911
This takes not only...
resources, but courage.

1438
02:12:52,036 --> 02:12:53,996
This takes...

1439
02:12:54,122 --> 02:12:57,333
not only... government,

1440
02:12:57,458 --> 02:13:00,002
but families.

1441
02:13:01,963 --> 02:13:04,006
I've laid out a--

1442
02:13:07,426 --> 02:13:11,389
I've laid out
a ten-point plan that--

1443
02:13:26,488 --> 02:13:28,407
I can't do this.

1444
02:13:31,827 --> 02:13:35,873
If there is a war on drugs,

1445
02:13:35,998 --> 02:13:40,043
then many of our family members
are the enemy.

1446
02:13:43,505 --> 02:13:48,719
And I don't know how you wage war
on your own family.

1447
02:14:31,888 --> 02:14:34,599
National Airport, please.

1448
02:15:19,854 --> 02:15:23,983
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.
You're working too hard, my friend.

1449
02:15:24,066 --> 02:15:27,319
Carl, I'm running late.
I'm coming right over.

1450
02:15:27,403 --> 02:15:32,366
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.
Let me ask you something.

1451
02:15:32,449 --> 02:15:35,369
When were you gonna tell me
about the $3 million...

1452
02:15:35,453 --> 02:15:39,915
we got in from San Francisco
two days after I was arrested?

1453
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:43,961
Um... I was waiting
for the right time.

1454
02:15:44,086 --> 02:15:47,339
Oh. You didn't think you could trust
my wife with that information?

1455
02:15:47,465 --> 02:15:49,508
I didn't want to risk it.

1456
02:15:49,633 --> 02:15:52,178
That could have been frozen
along with everything else.

1457
02:15:52,261 --> 02:15:54,513
You had it all figured out,
didn'tyou?

1458
02:15:54,638 --> 02:15:56,557
You were gonna move into my house,

1459
02:15:56,640 --> 02:16:00,186
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

1460
02:16:00,311 --> 02:16:02,521
with my wife.

1461
02:16:02,646 --> 02:16:04,900
Sounds like a nice plan.

1462
02:16:05,025 --> 02:16:06,985
Oh, is it insane?

1463
02:16:07,068 --> 02:16:09,696
Just think about it, okay?
If I was gonna rip you off,

1464
02:16:09,821 --> 02:16:12,032
why wouldn't I just leave town
after Ruiz was killed?

1465
02:16:12,157 --> 02:16:15,327
Why would I sit next to you
in court and listen to a dismissal?

1466
02:16:15,410 --> 02:16:19,706
Let me ask you something.
You think there's a difference
between a reason and an excuse?

1467
02:16:19,831 --> 02:16:22,375
'Cause I don't.

1468
02:16:22,501 --> 02:16:25,796
- Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl--

1469
02:16:25,921 --> 02:16:27,881
Carl?

1470
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:37,891
Come on, sweetheart.

1471
02:16:38,016 --> 02:16:41,061
Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

1472
02:16:41,186 --> 02:16:43,605
- Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh--

1473
02:16:43,688 --> 02:16:45,899
- He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

1474
02:16:46,024 --> 02:16:48,568
- Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

1475
02:16:50,237 --> 02:16:52,155
- Hello.
- It's a great party.

1476
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,574
- Who is he, a friend of yours?
- Oh, I'm a nobody.

1477
02:16:54,699 --> 02:16:57,245
I'm the nobody who arrested you.

1478
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:59,789
- You're--
- How you doing?

1479
02:16:59,872 --> 02:17:02,291
- What are you doing in my house?
- Oh, just looking around.

1480
02:17:02,375 --> 02:17:05,795
You got nice shit. Drug money
buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

1481
02:17:05,878 --> 02:17:08,214
Listen, you don't want to talk
that way in my house.

1482
02:17:08,297 --> 02:17:10,424
You're fucking a murderer, Carl.

1483
02:17:10,550 --> 02:17:12,969
- Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- Hey, you can't be in here.

1484
02:17:13,052 --> 02:17:16,472
- Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

1485
02:17:16,556 --> 02:17:18,558
- I'm a cop.
- I don't care.

1486
02:17:18,641 --> 02:17:21,936
- Get out.
- Hey! Hey, hey!

1487
02:17:28,693 --> 02:17:32,613
- Is that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

1488
02:17:32,697 --> 02:17:34,782
Tell him how you murdered
my partner!

1489
02:17:34,907 --> 02:17:37,451
- You got the wrong--
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena!

1490
02:17:37,577 --> 02:17:40,788
Ray Castro!
You remember that!

1491
02:17:40,872 --> 02:17:43,124
- What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

1492
02:17:43,249 --> 02:17:45,168
- No, no, no, I got it.
- I got it.

1493
02:17:48,255 --> 02:17:50,299
- Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

1494
02:17:57,097 --> 02:17:59,016
What do you want to do, man?

1495
02:18:28,629 --> 02:18:32,549
On the good days, I feel like I get it.

1496
02:18:32,633 --> 02:18:36,553
Like it all makes sense.

1497
02:18:36,637 --> 02:18:38,972
I can stay in the moment.

1498
02:18:39,056 --> 02:18:43,853
I don't have to control
everything in the future...

1499
02:18:43,978 --> 02:18:49,692
and I believe everything
is gonna work out fine.

1500
02:18:52,987 --> 02:18:54,906
O-On the bad days,

1501
02:18:56,658 --> 02:19:00,870
I just want to grab the phone
and start dialing numbers.

1502
02:19:00,995 --> 02:19:04,707
I want to pull my hair...

1503
02:19:04,791 --> 02:19:09,045
and run through
the streets screaming.

1504
02:19:13,508 --> 02:19:18,555
But thanks to the people
I've met in these rooms,

1505
02:19:18,680 --> 02:19:22,892
like Margaret and Jim...

1506
02:19:23,017 --> 02:19:25,937
and Sarah,

1507
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:28,565
um...

1508
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:31,109
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna make it...

1509
02:19:31,192 --> 02:19:33,237
through today.

1510
02:19:44,707 --> 02:19:47,251
Would you like to share?

1511
02:19:48,544 --> 02:19:52,089
Uh... my name is Robert.

1512
02:19:52,214 --> 02:19:55,134
My wife Barbara and I...

1513
02:19:55,217 --> 02:19:59,096
are here to support
our daughter, Caroline,

1514
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:02,141
and we're hear to listen.
