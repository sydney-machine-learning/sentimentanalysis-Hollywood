00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,347
Look at the light
coming out of the earth

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,394
Show me a man
who's gentle and kind

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,983
And I'll show you
a loser

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,696
Now show me a man
who takes what he wants

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,866
Look at that boy
sitting on the moon

7
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,870
Look how exciting

8
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:41,041
Look how exciting

9
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,294
So the poets say

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:51,509
When you're a fool in love

11
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,638
And nothing goes
the way you plan

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,559
And no one cares
and no one understands

13
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:04,314
That you're a fool
and you're in love

14
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,319
Never another spring for you

15
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,031
Never a robin
to sing for you

16
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:17,243
You're out there
on your own

17
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,747
When you're a fool in love

18
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,753
When you're a fool in love

19
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,006
A fool in love
Seems like the skies

20
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,759
Are always gray

21
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,887
You turn around
there's someone in your way

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,934
And it's you
and you're in love

23
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,271
Sometimes you think
that your luck has changed

24
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,275
And a rainbow explodes
across the sky

25
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,781
But when you're
a fool in love

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:02,205
You'll be a fool
till the day you die

27
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,880
A fool in love

28
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,353
[Man]
I know we haven't been
together that long,

29
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,483
but these last ten months
have just been the happiest
of my life.

30
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,696
You're not only
the person I love,
you're also my best friend,

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,699
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,786
Will you marry me?

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes.

34
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,666
Seriously.
Do you think that sounds good?

35
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,919
- No!
- Really? 'Cause I think
that kinda sums up--

36
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,382
- No!
- Oh? Oh, sorry.
Sorry.

37
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,677
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

38
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,846
Well, thanks for listening.
I really appreciate it.

39
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,642
You've got a real gentle
touch there, Doctor.

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,978
She won't be able
to say no.

41
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,274
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

42
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,694
[Chattering]

43
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,614
Good luck, Greg.
Thanks, Kim.
Good luck, buddy.

[School Bell Ringing]

45
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay, it's time
for our problem of the week.

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,834
I want you to pick out
your problem--

47
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,754
a problem that's been
bothering you all week--

48
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,883
With your eyes still closed,

49
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,636
I want you to picture
that problem in your mind.

50
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,389
Pretend that it's right there
in front of you.

51
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,808
Not only are you
my best friend,

52
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,020
but you're also the person
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with.

53
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,024
I love you.
Will you... marry me?

54
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,862
Now I want you to scare
your problems away.
I want you to say boo.

55
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,073
[All]
Boo.

56
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,535
- Boo!
- [Screaming]
Boo!

57
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,496
[Chuckling]
All right, you guys are great.

58
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,833
Very good.
I will see you guys
after lunch, all right?

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,585
Hey, Pam, isn't that
your special friend outside?

60
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,381
Yeah, I think so.

61
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,425
Why don't you go
talk to him?

62
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,094
You think I should?
[All] Yeah.

63
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,474
Come here.

64
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,267
Come here.

65
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,854
Hi, sweetie.
How you doin'?

66
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,065
What's going on?
I was in the neighborhood,
got off work early.

67
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,067
Thought maybe you wanted
to get a bite to eat.

68
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,945
Oh, that's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,615
Oh, shoot, I forgot
to change my shoes.

70
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,994
You don't have to change.
I can't resist a man
in nurse's shoes.

71
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,329
I know, but I got sneakers
in my backpack.

72
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,374
- It'll just take a second.
- [Giggling] Okay.

73
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,044
- Honey--
- Hmm?

74
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,629
Pam, I love you.
Yeah?

75
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,091
I love you too.
Come on, sweetie.

76
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,303
I got a half hour
before I have to be back,
so you wanna go have lunch?

77
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,725
- What are you doing?
- Um, nothing.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,269
I just love you so much.

79
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,315
These last ten months
have been the happiest
of my life.

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,403
Yeah, they've been amazing.
W-What's going on?

81
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,074
Nothing. I just-- I just--
I just feel like we're so close.

82
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,952
You're my best friend,
and you're also the woman
that I love, and--

83
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,497
Are you okay, sweetie?
You're acting so weird.

84
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,041
I'm fine. I just got
a crick in my neck.
I was doing C.P.R....

85
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,293
on a 300-pound crack addict
this morning.
Oh, my goodness!

86
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,003
Do you want me to massage
your neck or something?

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,672
No, no, no,
I'm fine, I'm good.
A back rub? Are you sure?

88
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,674
Honey, look, your kids--
they're trying to tell you
something.

89
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,259
What? Hold on.
Look!
[Cell Phone Ringing]

90
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,763
Oh, it's my sister.
Hello? Hi!
I'm engaged!

91
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,142
You're engaged!
That's wonderful.
Congratulations!

92
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:55,730
Oh, my God, you're getting
married in two weeks.
That's a little soon.

93
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,859
Wow, Mom and Dad really
don't know Bob very well.
Dad was okay with this?

94
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,321
Well, Bob asked Dad.
Wow, that was
very thoughtful of him.

95
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,907
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

96
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,368
Yeah.
[Chuckling]

97
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,539
I'm just here with Greg.
He's gonna take me out
for lunch. He's okay.

98
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,166
Okay, yeah,
I know you gotta go.
I love you.

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,794
Okay, talk to you soon.
Bye.

100
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,007
So what's going on? What?
Debbie's marrying that guy?
Yeah, in two weeks.

101
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,426
Dr. Bob of Denver.
Isn't that great?

102
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,346
Yeah, yeah, that's--
Didn't they just meet
like a few months ago?

103
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,640
Well, yeah, but,
you know, he asked her,
and she said yes.

104
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,976
He asked my dad.
He said yes.
Then he asked Debbie.

105
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,938
Huh? Yeah, I overheard that.
So, what, like he had to ask
his permission?

106
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,982
No, no, he didn't have to.

107
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,444
Bob just understood
that Dad appreciates
that kind of thing.

108
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,072
Hmm? Mm-hmm.
Anyway, Deb said
Dad's crazy about him.

109
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,367
Evidently, Bob bought him,
like, the perfect gift
that just won him over.

110
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,203
You know?
Really? Huh?
A gift?

111
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,623
Are you sure it's okay
to X-ray this?

112
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,834
Yeah, it's not gonna mutate
or anything.

113
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,215
- Uh, sir, that's not gonna fit.
- Wait. Hang on a second.

114
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,677
The bag's too big, guy.
You gotta check it.

115
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,680
[Beeping]
Over here.

116
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,682
Raise your arms, sir.
Look.

117
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,560
I've got an engagement ring
for my girlfriend in the bag.

118
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,646
I can't open it here.
Don't you think I can
just carry it on?

119
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,485
Hey, pal, if it ain't fittin'
through the frame, you ain't
carryin' it on the plane.

120
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,197
- 531 -- New York La Guardia.
Check it.
- Wait, wait!

121
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,409
Excuse me!
Don't worry. It'll be waitin'
for you on the other side.

122
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,289
Baby, hurry
Don't make me worry

123
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,833
[Woman Over P.A.]
Welcome to New York's
La Guardia Airport.

[Baby Crying]

125
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,136
Excuse me. Hi.

126
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,056
You lost my bag,
and there's a two-carat
diamond ring inside it.

127
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,725
I didn't lose
your anything, sir.

128
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,187
But put your local address
on this form, and we'll
ship it when it surfaces.

129
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,690
And what if it doesn't?
Am I supposed to spend
the entire weekend...

130
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,609
with just the clothes
on my back?

131
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,611
[Crying Continues]

132
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,490
It's a great gift.
I just thought you were gonna
get them champagne.

133
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,576
Trust me. I think your dad
is gonna be very psyched
about this gift.

134
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,662
Well, don't forget
he's retired, though.

135
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,332
The guy was in the rare-flower
business for 30 years. I think
he still maintains an interest.

136
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,837
You make it sound like
they're really hard to please.
No, not at all!

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,464
He's the sweetest man
in the whole world.
Just relax!

138
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,591
He's gonna love you.
I promise.

139
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,593
As much as he loves
Dr. Bob?

140
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,305
Take it easy on the sarcasm.
Humor is entirely wasted
on my parents.

141
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,350
What, are they Amish?
[Pam Giggling]

142
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,314
Okay, no jokes.

143
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,985
What are you doing?
What?

144
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,988
I told you my dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

145
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,614
Okay, all right,
I'll leave 'em in the car.

146
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,910
No, no, no, no,
he'll check there.
Oh, gosh.

147
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,291
Yeah, the roof is probably
a better idea.

148
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,251
Okay. And, oh, uh,

149
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,004
we're not living
together.

150
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,923
I thought you said
you told him.
Well--

151
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,303
Hi, Daddy!
Hi!
Sweet pea!

152
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,140
I missed you so much,

I missed you too, Flapjack.

[Continue Kissing]

154
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,230
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy!

[Together]
Short stack, short stack,
coming up.

156
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,905
- Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba.
- Where's my "wittle" girl?

157
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,242
- Mommy! Mom!
- You look so beautiful.

158
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,828

So do you.
Look at you.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.
Great to finally meet you.

00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,337
Good meeting you.
And I'm Dina.
Welcome to Oyster Bay.

162
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,674
Oh, thanks.
Ah!

163
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,970
What are you driving there,
a Ford?

164
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,972
Oh, yeah, it's a Taurus.

165
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,893
We were gonna get a mid-size,
but I figure, hey,
we pull down decent bucks.

166
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,438
Might as well go all out,
pop for the full-size.

167
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,400
Sure. Interesting color.
You pick it?
Oh.

168
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,277
Oh, no, the guy at the counter.
Why?

169
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,738
Well, they say
geniuses pick green.

170
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,785
- But you didn't pick it.
- Jack!

171
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,790
Oh, yucky.
What smells
of old sour milk?

172
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,876
Oh, poor Greg got
spit up on by a baby.
He didn't.

173
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,422
Yeah, he did, Ma,
at the lost luggage counter.
The airline lost his bag.

174
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,132
They didn't!
Oh.

175
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,758
Yeah.
Yeah, they did.

176
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,802
What about you, honey?
Oh, no, no, no.
I carried on.

177
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,804
That's my girl.

178
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:45,478
It'll turn up, I'm sure.
And anyway, Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask.

179
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,482
That's right.
Mi casa es su casa.
Oh, thanks, Jack. You too.

180
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,860
Yeah.
[Giggling]

181
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,115
[Chattering]

182
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,327
This is so nice.
[Jack]
We like it.

183
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,496
[Sighs]
Beautiful.

184
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,876
Oh, now, Greg, you have
a very unique last name.

185
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,589
Um, we were curious,
how do you pronounce it?

186
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:17,844
Oh, just like it's spelled.
F-O-C-K-E-R.

187
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,641
Focker.
Hmm, Focker. Hmm.

188
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,643
Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,647
- Oh, I'll get it, honey.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

190
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,110
- Oh, there he is.
There's our little guy.
-Jinxy, come here, boy.

191
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,114
Come here, baby.
Come to Daddy, Jinxy.
Come on. Come on, Jinxy.

192
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,367
Come here.
Come to Daddy.
Jinxy!

193
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,411
Come on.
[Chuckles]
Taught him that in one week.

194
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,874
This is Pam's cat,
Jinxy. Jinxy,
say hello to Greg.

195
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,292
Hi, Jinx.
Wave to Greg.
Hello, Jinx.

196
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,462
Attaboy.
That took me another week.

197
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,382
Oh, my gosh.
Pam, I didn't know
you had a cat.

198
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,801
Yeah, I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

199
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,803
Your daddy's found
his new best friend.

200
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,596
You won't believe it.
He even taught him
to use the potty.

201
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,723
You won't believe it.
He even taught him
to use the potty.

202
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,893
- He did? Dad, that's
kinda weird, isn't it?
- What's so weird about it?

203
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,896
Now we don't have to smell
kitty litter all the time.
That's right.

204
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,191
That's incredible.
How did you teach the cat
to use the toilet?

205
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,320
Oh, that was easy, Greg.
I just designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet,

206
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,031
and then once he got used to it,
I took it away.

207
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,492
Yeah, makes sense.
But I don't think
he likes it.

208
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,162
I mean, every chance he gets,
he tries to dig, squat and bury.

209
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,581
I had to move
all my potted plants
off the floor.

210
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,210
Plus, you got another guy
around the house
to leave the seat up.

211
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,090
He can't lift
the seat, Greg.

212
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,426
He lacks the strength
and the opposable thumbs.
Yeah.

213
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,805
Ah, right. Opposable--
I didn't think about that.

214
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,809
Jinx is strictly a house cat.
Can't let him outside because he
lacks outdoor survival skills.

215
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,936
Okay.
One of those things,
isn't it, sweetheart?

216
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:55,025
I don't think Greg will be
playing with Jinxy too much.
He hates cats.

217
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,986
[Chuckles Nervously]
Pam, I don't hate cats.

218
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,947
I don't-- I don't hate cats.
I just happen to be
more of a dog lover.

219
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,116
Yeah, yeah.
[Mouthing]
I am too.

220
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,910
Well, that's okay
if you hate cats, Greg.
No!

221
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,581
I don't.
I don't hate cats at all.
[Jack] That's okay.

222
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,709
Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

223
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,628
I-- I'm being honest.
Really? Like what?

224
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,216
Honey, why don't we let
the kids freshen up, huh?

225
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,804
Greg, you come with me.
We'll get you something to wear
from Jack's closet, okay?

226
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,307
Okay.
Oh, honey, honey,
honey, honey.

227
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,894
- Yeah?
- I'm so happy you're home,
sweetheart.

228
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,979
Oh!
Me too, Dad.

229
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,612
Hey, listen,
be nice to this one, okay?
I kinda like him.

230
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,741
Okay, I'll try.
Thank you.

231
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,709
Shirt fit okay, Greg?
Oh, fantastic.
Thanks, Jack.

232
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,711
Good.
Tom Collins coming up.

233
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,757
- You know, I wish you hadn't
told your parents I hate cats.
- But you do hate cats.

234
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,884
Yeah, but you didn't have to
tell them right when we met.

235
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,886
I know. I'm sorry.
It just kinda slipped out.

236
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,724
Get your red-hot papooses.
My goodness, what is that?

237
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:15,105
Oh, that's just
a little something from me.
Go ahead. Open it up.

238
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,817
Oh. Look, honey,
Greg brought us a present.

239
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,819
Oh, isn't that nice?

240
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,409
Oh! Oh, look at this.

241
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,537
It's a flower pot
with the dirt in it.

242
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:35,917
- Hmm.
- Actually, the real gift is
what's planted in the soil.

243
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,754
The bulb
of a Jerusalem tulip.

244
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,720
Which I was told is one
of the rarest and most beautiful
flowers in existence.

245
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:51,182
Oh, right, right,
the Jerusalem--

246
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,728
From the "Jerusales
tulipesias" genus.
Yes, yes.

247
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,773
Hmm.
Anyway, yeah,

248
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,651
the guy said with regular
watering, it should bloom
in about six months, so--

249
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,404
Oh, we'll look forward
to that, Greg.

250
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:15,957
[Clearing Throat]
So, uh, Greg,
how's your job?

251
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,461
Um, good, Pam.
Thanks for asking.

252
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,506
I, uh, I recently
got transferred to triage.

253
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,508
Oh, is that better
than a nurse?

254
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,678
No, Mom, triage is
a unit of the E.R.

255
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,972
It's where all
the top nurses work.
Well--

256
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,726
No, they do.
[Chuckling Nervously]

257
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,438
Not many men
in your profession, though,
are there, Greg?

258
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,067
No, Jack,
not traditionally.
Mm-hmm.

259
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,739
Oh, Pam, honey, did you know
that your father started
his own business?

260
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,284
Really?
Dad, that's great.
Oh, wow!

261
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,703
Yes, I thought
with my knowledge
and experience,

262
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,705
why should I allow
retirement to stop me?

263
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,333
I really admire that.
Yeah.

264
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,127
So what is it?
What's the new venture?

265
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,797
Let me ask you
a question, Greg.

266
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,424
Let's just say
you have kids...

267
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,594
and you wanna
get out of the house,
spend a night on the town.

268
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,389
So, you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

269
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,308
References, work experience--
it all checks out fine.

270
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,436
But then how do you
really know for certain...

271
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,773
that your loved ones are safe
with this stranger?

272
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:26,236
I mean, can you ever
really trust another
human being, Greg?

273
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,281
Sure, I think so.

274
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,742
No, the answer is
you cannot.

275
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,163
Let me show you something.

276
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,499
Take a look at this, Greg.

277
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,462
What's this look like
to you?
Um--

278
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,298
[Squeaks]
This looks like
a teddy bear.

279
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,635
Smile, you're on
"Nanny Camera."
Ah!

280
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:54,472
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah!
I've seen these things
advertised on TV.

281
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,100
Oh, no,
not like this, you haven't.
Take a look.

282
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,104
Oh, my gosh.
Hi!
Oh!

283
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,984
Where's the other camera?
Right here in this
decorative artifact.

284
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,695
Wow, that's great.
Our cameras are
motion-activated,

285
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,031
so they begin taping
as soon as they sense
any movement.

286
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:15,535
We can hide 'em in anything.
We hide 'em in mirrors, lamps,
televisions, you name it.

287
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,537
So no matter where you go,

288
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,957
we'll be watching you.
[Pam Chuckling]

289
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,672
So, Jack, couldn't this
maybe be construed as illegal?
You know, invasion of privacy?

290
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,385
Trust me, Greg, when you
start having little Fockers
running around,

291
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,637
you'll understand the need
for this level of protection.

292
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,639
Mm.

293
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,771
Impressive, isn't it?

294
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:43,772
Quite. Mm.
[Phone Ringing]

295
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,148
Quite. Mm.
[Phone Ringing]

296
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,816
Oh, I'll get that.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

297
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,568
Honey, I'll get it.

298
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,695
[Chuckling]
Okay.

299
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,366
Any problem
with the documents?

300
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,078
Okay. I'll meet you
at the Oyster Bay Drugstore
in about 20 minutes.

301
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,747
Now you gotta be more careful
when you call here.

302
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,291
If anybody else answers,
just use a Southern accent...

303
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,543
and ask for
the vegetarian special, okay?

304
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,255
[Chattering]

305
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,133
Oh, that wasn't
the airline, was it?

306
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,260
Nope, wrong number.

307
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,846
We're all out of Collins mix,
so I'm gonna make a run
for the store.

308
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,224
That's funny.
I thought I just bought some.

309
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,686
You know how that stuff--
it just goes,
so I'll be back in a jiff.

310
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,063
Well, why doesn't Greg
go with you?

311
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,735
Sweetie, you'll need something
in case your suitcase
doesn't show up.

312
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,113
- Oh, I'm sure it'll show up.
- Yeah.

313
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,991
You don't wanna take a chance.
You don't have a toothbrush.
Go on, sweetie.

314
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,454
Yeah.
Okay, unless you want
some privacy.

315
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,499
Why would I need privacy?

316
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,377
No, I didn't think you would.

317
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,713
Okay, let's head out.
[Dina]
Oh, good.

318
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,008
Bye.

319
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,262
Have fun, you guys.
Pam, he seems wonderful.

320
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:01,099
He is. We have
the best time together.
Good.

321
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,852
Now, have you two been
mm, mm, mm?

322
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,604
Mother!
Oh, thinking about
anything permanent.

323
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,191
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, we haven't really
discussed it,

324
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,194
but I definitely
have a feeling
this is it.

325
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:17,198
[Sighs]
Dad seems to like him.
Don't you think?

326
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,200
Absolutely.

327
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,666
Big day, Saturday.
Nice car.

328
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,963
Yes.
This car is--

329
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,716
You got--
What do you use?
Unleaded? Regular unleaded?

330
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,718
Premium.
Uh-huh.

331
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:45,852
Hey, you know, Jack,
now that we have
a second to talk,

332
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,397
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

333
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,524
I know-- I know
that we haven't been
together that long,

334
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,904
but the time
that we have spent together
has been really incredible.

335
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,490
Greg, how come
you don't like cats?

336
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,827
I don't not like cats.

337
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,039
I-l just--
I just prefer dogs.

338
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:10,043
I mean, I'm just
more of a dog kind of,
you know--

339
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,423
Come home,
wagging their little tails,
happy to see you kind of--

340
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:20,261
You need that assurance?
You prefer an emotionally
shallow animal?

341
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,263
I--

342
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,683
You see, Greg,
when you yell at a dog,

343
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,853
his tail will go between
his legs and cover his genitals,
his ears will go down.

344
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,232
A dog is very easy to break,
but cats make you work
for their affection.

345
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:38,154
- They don't sell out
the way dogs do.
- Huh.

346
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,205
You like
Peter, Paul and Mary?
[Tape Starts]

347
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,709
Yes, I do.
I'm a big fan.

348
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,254
Puff the magic dragon
Dragon

349
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,298
Lived by the sea

350
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:01,761
Great song.
Yeah, one of
my favorites.

351
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,431
Who would've thought
it wasn't really
about a dragon, huh?

352
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,434
[Chuckling]
What do you mean?

353
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,436
[Continues]

354
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,230
You know,
the whole drug thing.

355
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,318
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

356
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:22,782
Some people think that...

357
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,326
to "puff the magic dragon"
means to--

358
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,830
They're really, uh--

359
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,750
to smoke-- to smoke--

360
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,836
a marijuana cigarette.

361
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,631
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

362
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,676
Right.

363
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,724
Are you a pothead,
Focker?
No! No.

364
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,062
What?
No, no, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm-- I'm not-- I--

365
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,647
I pass on grass
all the time.

366
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,858
I mean, not all the time.
Yes or no, Greg?

367
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,360
No. Yes. No.

368
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,870
Hey, Greg, I'll meet you
back out front in about...
12 to 15 minutes.

369
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,872
Okay.

370
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,263
Oh.

371
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:32,185
Hey. Hi.
How you doing?
Hey.

372
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,729
Do you have any of those
nicotine patches?

373
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:39,609
No. We have the gum.

374
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,363
Great.
You chew it.

375
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,908
Thank you. Yes, okay.
And what's your most expensive
bottle of champagne?

376
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,161
Mumm's.
It's on sale for 13.95.

377
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,247
Really? That's it?
You don't have, like,

378
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,000
a nice, like,
80 or $100 bottle
of something?

379
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,962
You can get
a whole bunch of Mumm's.

380
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,166
Focker.
Hey, Jack.
Ready to go?

381
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,337
I've been ready, yeah.
They ran out
of Collins mix.

382
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:46,092
- You been waiting here long?
- No, I was just
reading up about...

383
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,723
pumps.
Pumps?

384
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,185
Yes. Breast pumps.

385
00:23:57,062 --> 00:24:00,106
I grew up on a farm.

386
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,029
Dankeschoen

387
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,281
Get your hot buns,
hot patooties.

388
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:11,117
Wow, Dina,
everything looks fabulous.

389
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:14,621
It's such a treat for me to have
a home-cooked meal like this.

390
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,123
Dinner at my house usually
consisted of everybody
in the kitchen...

391
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,125
fighting over containers
of Chinese food.

392
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,046
You poor thing.
What, there wasn't enough food
to go around?

393
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:27,384
No, there was.
We just never really sat down
like a family like this.

394
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,262
- Oh.
- Greg, would you like
to say grace?

395
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,308
Oh, uh, well,
Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.

396
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:40,814
You're telling me
Jews don't pray, honey?
Unless you have some objection.

397
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,108
No, no, no, no,
I'd love to.

398
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,110
Pam, come on,
it's not like I'm a rabbi
or something.

399
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:48,613
I said grace
at many a dinner table.

400
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,998
Okay.

401
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:05,380
O dear God,

402
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,635
thank You.

403
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:15,181
You are such a good God to us,
a kind and gentle...

404
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:19,686
and accommodating God.

405
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,023
And we thank You, Osweet,

406
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,151
sweet Lord of hosts...

407
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,153
for the...

408
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,990
smorgasbord...

409
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:36,536
You have so aptly lain
at our table this day...

410
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,373
and each day... by day.

411
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,211
Day by day by day.

412
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,716
O dear Lord,

413
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,093
three things we pray.

414
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,930
To love Thee more dearly,

415
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:00,518
to see Thee more clearly,

416
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:04,064
to follow Thee
more nearly...

417
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:08,234
day by day...
by day.

418
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,903
Amen.
Amen.

419
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,572
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

420
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:16,368
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting too.

421
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:27,921
Oh, that's a--
that's a lovely vase.
That's great.

422
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,841
Let me guess, Jack.
Is that one of your
secret cameras too?

423
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,345
- Boogah-woogah-woogah!
[Stammering]
- [Pam] Greg.

424
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,850
Greg, that's an urn
which holds the remains
of Jack's mother.

425
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,688
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

426
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,690
That's all right.
You didn't know, Greg.

427
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,943
I'm--
That's our Gran-gran.

428
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:54,489
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

429
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,950
Love you, Ma.
Miss you.

430
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,785
Miss you every day.

431
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,205
Oh, honey, why don't you
read Greg your poem?

432
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,416
Oh, no, he doesn't want
to hear that.

433
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,418
What? No!
What-What-What poem?

434
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,254
You see,
when Jack had to retire...

435
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,965
for health reasons--
That's a bunch of malarky.
Honey, I'm fine.

436
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,010
The doctor thought it would be
therapeutic if he...

437
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,429
sort of expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

438
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:21,641
Honey, you wrote
the most beautiful poem
about your mother.

439
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,643
Please, we really
wanna hear it.

440
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,312
Poem, poem.
Please!

441
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,316
Oh, all right.
It's a work in progress.

442
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,777
I'm still not happy with it.

443
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,155
As soon as it's ready,

444
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:39,117
then I am going to glaze it
onto a plate...
Mm.

445
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,327
and put it
next to the urn.
Nice.

446
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,288
It's very special.

447
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:47,792
"My Mother"
by Jack Byrnes.

448
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,172
"You gave me life,
you gave me milk,

449
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,466
'you gave me courage.

450
00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:00,430
"Your name was Angela,
the angel from heaven,

451
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:04,601
"but you were also
an angel of God,
and He needed you too.

452
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,979
"Selfishly I tried
to keep you here...

453
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,690
"while the cancer
ate away your organs...

454
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,026
"like an unstoppable
rebel force.

455
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:18,865
"But I couldn't save you,
and I shall see your face...

456
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:23,119
"nevermore, nevermore,

457
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,081
"nevermore,
[Crying]

458
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:30,377
until we meet...
in heaven."

459
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,047
- [Sighs]
- Daddy, that's beautiful.

460
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,217
[Whispering]
It always gets me.
Amazing. So-So--

461
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,846
So much love, yet also
so much information.
[Groans]

462
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,350
It takes a lot
out of him.

463
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:51,481
Greg, would you like
some yams?
Thank you. Oh, yeah.

464
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,818
You must've had vegetables
fresher than that,
growing up on a farm, Greg.

465
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:58,571
Dad, uh, Greg grew up
in Detroit.

466
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,533
He told me he grew up on a farm.

467
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,788
- Do they have many farms
in Detroit?
- No, Dina, no, not a lot.

468
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,790
In fact, Jack,
I should clarify this.

469
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:13,086
I didn't actually grow up...
on a farm per se.

470
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,673
The house we grew up in
was originally erected...

471
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,884
in the early Dutch farm,
colonial style.

472
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,513
So that, plus we had
a lot of pets--

473
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,477
- Which one did you milk then?
- Dad!

474
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,938
Honey, he said
he pumped milk.

475
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,774
What have you
ever milked?

476
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,404
A cat.

477
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:42,407
A cat?

478
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,787
I milked a cat once.
You wanna hear a story?
Sure.

479
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:53,460
My sister had a cat,
and the cat birthed
a litter of kittens.

480
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,546
Must've been 30 of them,
and there was this one
little runt...

481
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:59,799
this little sweet little...
little-engine-that-could runt...

482
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:03,595
who wanted to get up there
and couldn't really get access
to the-- to the--

483
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:07,223
to the-- to the--
to the teat.

484
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,100
Teat?

485
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,102
Dad.
What have you.

486
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:16,566
I went in
and just simply,
you know, just--

487
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,156
into a little saucer,

488
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:28,119
then took the saucer
and fed it to Geppetto--
that's what I named him.

489
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,997
I had-- I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

490
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:33,458
Oh, yeah, you can milk
anything with nipples.

491
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,005
I have nipples, Greg.
Could you milk me?

492
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,966
Okay, could we change
the subject perhaps?

493
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,720
Oh!
Champagne, champagne.
Yes.

494
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,765
I thought maybe we could
celebrate with a little bubbly.
That'd be great.

495
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,433
Good idea.
Yum!

496
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,152
[Mocking Jack]
"l have nipples.
Can you milk me?"

497
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,656
Well, in a funny way,
you've already seen
Deb's ring.

498
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,866
Mm-hmm, that's true.

499
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:12,205
Would anybody care for a bottle
of Oyster Bay Drug and Sundries
finest champagne?

500
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:15,875
That is so sweet of you, Greg.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

501
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:20,130
That's very nice.
How could I have seen
Debbie's ring, Mom?

502
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:23,008
Well, when I gave Bob
the okay to propose to Deb,

503
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,176
I put him in touch
with my diamond guy,

504
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,887
and he picked out
the same design
Kevin gave you.

505
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,976
Kevin, your old boyfriend?
[Clears Throat]
Thanks, Dad.

506
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,021
Well, yeah,
Kevin was Pam's fianc?

507
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,939

- Oh!

508
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,942
- [Dina Whimpering]
- [Groaning]

509
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,695
- Oh!
- [Whimpering Continues]
- Oh, my God.

510
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,740
J-Jinxy, no!
Psst!

511
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,742
- Oh!
-Jinxy, no!

512
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,994
- [Urinating]
- [Screaming]
- Oh, God.

513
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,455
- Oh.
- Shit.

514
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,334
Greg, sweetie,
how you doing?

515
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:01,588
Oh, just fine,
considering I desecrated
your grandma's remains,

516
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:05,759
found out you were engaged
and had your father ask me
to milk him.

517
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,927
At least back then he was
still talking to me.

518
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:11,765
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were that close.
Who, Daddy and me?

519
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,933
No, Kevin and you.

520
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,935
Do we have to know everything
about each other's pasts?

521
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,606
You never told me about
your cat-milking days in Motown.

522
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,734
That was
a long time ago, Pam.

523
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,986
Yeah, okay, well,
so was this.

524
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:30,992
Kevin's and my connection
was more physical
than anything else.

525
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:35,205
Physical?
Like what? Like you
worked out together?

526
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,794
No, no, it was nothing, nothing.
It was a stupid sexual thing.
Mm-hmm.

527
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,088
I'm gonna go throw up now.

528
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,090
[Groans]
Greg, listen.

529
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:49,260
Kevin and I were only engaged
for a month before I realized
that I'd made a mistake, okay?

530
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,180
I-l-l gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago,

531
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,809
and I met and fell
in love with you, okay,
so can we please drop this?

532
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,812
[Sighs]
Okay.

533
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:02,148
Good.
I just feel like this
is not going well at all.

534
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,652
I feel like your dad
hates me.
He doesn't hate you, sweetie.

535
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,530
Come on. Just give him
a chance, all right?

536
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,532
Maybe he's nervous too,
huh?

537
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:15,078
I thought he would love
my gift, you know,
being this big flower guy,

538
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:18,456
but it's like he didn't
even show the slightest bit
of interest.

539
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,460
Listen to me.
Forget the gift.

540
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:27,132
You are the most adorable,
loving, sweetest man
in the whole world,

541
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:29,634
and I love you.

542
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,178
And very soon my parents
are gonna see that...

543
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,431
and grow to love you too,
okay?

544
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,433
Okay?

545
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,479
Speaking of growing
to love you--

546
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,857
Honey, it's late.
Come on.
I know it's late.

547
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,152
But Mr. Winky is still
on Chicago time,

548
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:51,114
and we both know
there's only one way
to make Mr. Winky go away.

549
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:55,785
[Knocking]
And there it is.

550
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,624
What's with the robe?

551
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,337
It's Pam's. My pajamas
are in the suitcase
with everything else.

552
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,716
Hey, I'll lend you a pair
of Jack's. Okay, honey?
Sure.

553
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,509
You don't have to do that,
Dina.
Oh, no, no, no.

554
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,386
No, that's fine.
We have to.

555
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,222
Thank you.
You're welcome.

556
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,267
Look, Greg,
I just wanna say, don't worry
about what happened tonight.

557
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:24,731
Oh, thanks, Jack.
Still, I feel horrible.
I mean--

558
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,275
Well, it was
a horrible thing.

559
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:35,450
But let's just put all that
behind us and enjoy
our weekend together.

560
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:40,038
Okay. Okay.
Thank you, Daddy.

Oh, thank you.
Thanks, Mom.

563
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,585
These'll do just fine.
Good night.

564
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,087
Night-night.

565
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,715
Good night, sweetie.
See you in the morning.
Good night.

566
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,301
Have a nice sleep.
Okay, you too.

567
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:58,598
Oh, no, no, no, Greg,
we made up the pullout
for you down in the den.

568
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:03,061
Oh, okay, 'cause Pam said
I should sleep in Debbie's room.

569
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:06,314
Well, Debbie'll be
sleeping here tomorrow.

570
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,650
This way,
you'll have more privacy,
you'll have your own bathroom.

571
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,445
Just try not to flush
the toilet. It's always
a little quirky.

572
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,116
- Okay.
- Oh, one more thing.

573
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,870
I'm a realist.
I understand it's
the 21st century,

574
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,456
and you've probably had
premarital relations
with my daughter.

575
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,586
But under our roof, it's my way
or the Long Island Expressway.

576
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,965
Is that understood?
Of course, yeah.

577
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:35,010
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.

578
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,346
Okay.

Oh!

586
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,171
Sorry.

587
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,886
I don't know what it is,
but there's just something
about him that's a little off.

588
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,722
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jack, you know we've been
through this...

589
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:25,769
with every boyfriend
Pam has had since,
what, middle school.

590
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:29,856
I think Greg--
he's a lovely young man.

591
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:33,026
And, honey, Pam thinks
he might be the one.

592
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:37,155
She said that?
She said those exact words?

593
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,241
I didn't tape record it, Jack,
but that's the impression.

594
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,625
What kind of a family
doesn't have time
to sit down for dinner?

Please try to enjoy
the weekend, honey.

596
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:56,257
Both our daughters
are in love.
That's what I'm worried about.

597
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,259
Oh.

598
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,806
Oh, geez,
I just realized something.
What?

599
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,308
Pam's middle name.
Martha.

600
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,311

00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,511
Looking for something,
Greg?
Oh!

604
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:27,807
Jesus, Jack,
you scared me.

605
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:31,811
I heard a noise,
so I came down to see
if everything was okay.

606
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:35,690
Everything's fine. I just--
I'm sorry. I saw a light on,
and I kinda stumbled in.

607
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:39,152
I didn't realize--
That's okay.
See anything interesting?

608
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:42,655
No, not at all.
I mean, I mean--

609
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:47,285
I mean, this is great, though.
I love this-- what you--
it's a cozy little nook.

610
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,537
I noticed you were looking
at that when I came in.

611
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:55,001
Yeah.
It's an antique
polygraph machine.

612
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,879
Is that what that is?
I've seen these before,

613
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,964
but I never saw one
actually up close.

614
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,428
You know what?
Why don't you
try that on?

615
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,181
Oh, that's okay.

616
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:11,267
Oh, come on.
We'll have some fun.
I'll show you how it works.

617
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,894
I-l shouldn't.

618
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,064
- Why should you be afraid?
You have nothing to hide.
- No, I know.

619
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:19,025
- I know you know, so there
shouldn't be any problem.
- No, there's no problem.

620
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,737
- So, try it on.
- Okay.

621
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,907
I'll help you.

622
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,624
Don't worry.
You'll enjoy this.

623
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:40,046
All right.

624
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,925
Looks complicated.
Now these aren't
100% accurate, right?

625
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,387
They're--
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

626
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,973
They can tell fairly easily
if someone's lying or not.

627
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,893
Now I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

628
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,895
and all you have to do
is answer "yes" or "no."

629
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,481
- Okay.
- All right.

630
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,483
Let's give it a whirl.

631
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,362
Did you fly
on an airplane today?

632
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:07,907
Yes, I did.
No peeking.

633
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:13,121
- Did we eat pot roast
for dinner tonight?
- Yes.

634
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,165
Was it under-cooked?

635
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,295
No, it was rare.

636
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:24,215
It was a little rare
for my taste.

637
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,886
But I wouldn't--
I'm just kidding,
I'm just--

638
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,680
[Laughing Nervously]

639
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,475
Relax. Relax.
The needles are jumping.

640
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:38,813
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

641
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,613
No.

642
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:51,242
- I mean, well, I don't--
- Yes or no?

643
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:03,963
- Hey!
- Hey.

644
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,678
What's the matter?
You can't sleep?

645
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:14,474
No, no, I'm just going over some
of my answers from the polygraph
test your dad gave me.

646
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:17,268
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.

647
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:19,688
Well, did you lie to him?

648
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,941
No! I mean--
Well, he asked me if
we were living together,

649
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,527
and--
What'd you tell him?

650
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,570
I-l-l-- Nothing.
Your mother walked in...

651
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,699
and yanked the little thingies
off before I had to answer.

652
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:34,202
Is this how you'd react
if I told you he shoved bamboo
shoots up my fingernails?

653
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:38,665
Or does he hook
all your boyfriends up
to his little machine?

654
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:42,002
Well, he doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

655
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:46,715
What?
Greg, my father was never
in the rare flower business.

656
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,759
That was just his cover.

657
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,762
He was in the C.I.A.
for 34 years.

658
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,681
How could you not
tell me this?

659
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,143
I wanted to, honey,
but it was strictly...

660
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,312
on a need-to-know basis.

661
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,860
So, what?
He's in the C.I.A.?
He was a spy? He is a spy?

662
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,237
No, he was more like
a psychological profiler.

663
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:12,574
They used him to interrogate
suspected double agents
in the company.

664
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,826
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.

665
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:17,287
I was scared of your dad
back when I thought
he was a florist.

666
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:20,582
It's wonderful to know
that I've actually got
a C.I.A. spy-hunter on my ass.

667
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:24,586
Would you stop?
You're doing great, okay?

668
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:27,756
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

669
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:31,926
It's just weird.
Oh, I know,
but you're doing fine.

670
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,888
I promise.

671
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,938
Mm, no, no!
W-What's wrong, sweetie?

672
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:47,734
I forgot. I'm not
supposed to let the snake
out of my cage.

673
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,361
Your what?

674
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,780
I told your dad
I wouldn't touch you
for 72 hours.

675
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:54,908
Okay, I'm not in junior high
anymore, so--
No, no, no.

676
00:42:54,991 --> 00:42:58,036
Seriously. I want to try
to respect his rules, okay?

677
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,789
Okay. Fine.

678
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:04,959
Uh, why don't you go ahead
and get some sleep,
and I'll see you in the morning.

679
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:06,378
Okay.

680
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,883
[Purring]

681
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:21,768
- Morning, Greg.
- Good morning.

682
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:25,980
Pam told me she let you in
on a little secret of mine
last night.

683
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,817
Yes, she did.

684
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:32,654
Well, as long as
you can keep your mouth shut
for the rest of your life,

685
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,115
you're in no immediate danger.

686
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,952
I won't tell.

687
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm just being humorous.

688
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,208
Huh. That was funny.

689
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,005
But the fact is, Greg,
with the knowledge
you've been given,

690
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,174
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call...

691
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:57,137
"the Byrnes family
circle of trust."

692
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,098
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me...

693
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:03,018
and round and round we go.

694
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:07,439
Okay.
Understood.

695
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:12,861
Okay, good. Come on.
Let's go inside
and have breakfast.

I love you

Jinxy. Jinxy.

700
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,711
Not at the table,
honey, please.

701
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:34,215
- Attaboy!
- Hey, hey, look who's up!

702
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,842
Hi, sweetie.
You must be Greg.

703
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:40,722
- Hello.
- Oh, look, somebody had a visit
from the hair fairy.

704
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:44,559
Oh, yes.
Nice 'do, nice 'do.

705
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:46,853
I'll do the intros.
Greg, this is my sister,
Debbie.

706
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,855
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, the bride to be.

707
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:51,399
- Congratulations.
- And her fianc? Dr. Bob.

708
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,735
You can call me
Bob... M.D.

00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,405
- These are his parents,
Linda Banks,
- Hi. How are you?

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,909
Nice to meet you.
and the world-famous
plastic surgeon, Dr. Larry.

711
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,411
Whoa, now,
cut that out.

712
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,915
You know, Greg's
in medicine, too, Larry.

713
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,959
- Oh, really? What field?
- Nursing.

714
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:12,545
[Both Laughing]
That's good.

715
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,757
No, really.
What field?

716
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,801
Nursing.

717
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,432
Hey, why don't I get you
a chair, Greg?

718
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,976
Thank you.
Thanks.

719
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,979
So, you didn't want
to go for the M.D.?

720
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:34,025
No, I actually thought
about becoming a doctor,
but I decided it wasn't for me.

721
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,027
Just as well.
Boards are killer.

722
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:38,905
Actually Greg aced
his MCATs.

723
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:41,241
- You serious?
- No, I did okay.

724
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,618
Oh, he did more than okay.
Trust me.

725
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:46,746
Why did you take the test
if you weren't planning
on going to med school?

726
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,915
Well, I wanted to keep
my options open,

727
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,001
but in the end,
nursing was a better fit for me.

728
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,004
It gives you the freedom
to work in several different
areas of medicine.

729
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,047
Plus, I can focus
100% on patient care,

730
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:58,591
as opposed to being a doctor
where you have to deal
with the bureaucracy.

731
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:02,053
Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?
Oh, my God!

732
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:07,100
I thought Deb told you.
Dr. Andy threw out his back.
He can't make the wedding.

733
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:10,311
Oh, damn.
Now I have to reconfigure
the whole procession.

734
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:15,150
Um, Bob, why doesn't Greg
stand in for Andy,
be the usher?

735
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:19,988
- Oh! No, Pam, no.
- That'll be fine. Bob,
Greg'll be your second usher.

736
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:24,659
- Good.
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, okay, sure.

737
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:28,496
Good. Let's all finish up
and get ready to go...

738
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,250
because we have a pre-activity
briefing in about 32 minutes.
Thirty-two minutes!

739
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:35,253
You know what? In that case,
I'd better get upstairs...

740
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:38,006
and pay a little visit
to the shower fairy.

741
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,220
Dina, thank you so much
for breakfast.

742

[Chattering]

743
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,519
Hey, you okay?
Why didn't you wake me up?

744
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:55,440
- Because I thought
you'd like to sleep late.
- Not when I'm a guest.

745
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:57,942
- It's okay.
Don't worry about it.
- No, it's not okay.

746
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:01,112
Tell that
to Dr. Torquemada in there
with the Grand Inquisition.

747
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:03,615
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come back down.

748
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,035
- Get dressed in what?
- Borrow some more
of Dad's clothes.

749
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:09,704
No, I don't-- Come on.
Why not, honey?

750
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:13,541
I just--
No, I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

751
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,544
Okay, well, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

752
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,546
You want me to go wake up
your brother who I never met...

753
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,966
and ask if I could have
some of his clothes?

754
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:27,138
Okay, all right.
Where's Denny's room?
Top of the stairs, turn right.

756
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:40,151

Hello?
Hello?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What
the hell you doing in here?
Hi!

760
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:05,010
I'm-- I'm Greg,
Pam's friend.

761
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:07,262
What? Were you just
sniffing my boxers, dude?

762
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:11,349
No, dude, no.
No, no, she said I could
come up here,

763
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:13,435
maybe borrow some clothes
from you.
Do me a favor. Close the door.

764
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,478
Okay.
Quick.

765
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,734
- Tell anybody I wasn't here?
- No, they think you're asleep.

766
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:24,237
Yeah, so, it's all good.
[Sighing]
You scared me.

767
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,581
Dad keeps you guys under
a pretty close watch, huh?

768
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:40,086
No, it's not that bad.
Your little Pamcake's got it
a lot worse than I do.

769
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,716
Oh! You need some clothes.
Yes, that would be--
that would be great.

770
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:47,886
Glad to hook you up.
All right?
Cool.

771
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,972
Like what you done
with the crib.

772
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:54,142
Oh, L'il Kim.

773
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:56,186
She's phat.

774
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,984
P-H phat.

775
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:05,111
Yeah, I think these ought a
do it. All right,
here you go, chief.

776
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,113
All right!
Enjoy!

777
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,199
Thanks a lot, Denny.
No problem.

778
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:13,161
Oh, and don't worry
about the little covert op,
all right?

779
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:15,246
I'll keep it on the lowdown.
Down low.

780
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,125
No doubt.
[Jack Imitating Trumpet]

People, people, come get
your revised itineraries.

782
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:26,299
Larry, Linda,
Debbie, Bob, honey.

783
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:30,428
Now, I'm gonna activate
the alarm. It'll go off
in T minus 16 seconds.

784
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,681
I don't think I need
a jacket.
It's cold out, honey.

785
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,850
Hold on.
Here, take Denny's jacket.

786
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:42,399
Hey, Denny, I'm lending Greg
your jacket, okay?
Whatever.

787
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:44,401
Let's go.

788
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,208
Denny, how's the tux fit?

789
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,253
Dad, uh--
What's that?

790
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,839
I-It's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

791
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:12,470
This isn't a sculpture, Denny.
This is a device
for smoking marijuana.

792
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:15,557
Really?

793
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:20,645
Not mine.
It's not.

794
00:50:23,648 --> 00:50:26,401
Oh, hey, Jack.
How you doing?

795
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:31,698
I like the top hat.
Complements you.

796
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:34,743
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

797
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:40,165
Sit down.

798
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:48,173
Did I not clearly explain
the circle of trust
to you, Greg?

799
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:51,009
Mm, yeah,
I think I got it.

800
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,720
Then is there something
you wanna tell me?

801
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:56,222
Mm, l-l don't think so.

802
00:50:56,306 --> 00:51:00,602
Didn't we have
a discussion yesterday
in the car about this?

803
00:51:00,685 --> 00:51:02,854
Oh, yes!
You mean-- Yes!

804
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:05,148
You mean me and Pam.
Yes, I would love to talk
to you about that.

805
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:07,650
We're not talking about Pam.
We're talking about you.

806
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,196
See, if I can't trust you,
Greg, then I have no choice...

807
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,239
but to put you right back
outside the circle.

808
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:16,368
And once you're out, you're out.
There's no coming back.

809
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:21,414
Mm, well, I would
definitely like to stay
inside the circle.

810
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,750
Well, then, tell me the truth.

811
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,752
Okay.

812
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:33,510
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

813
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,096
All right, now look, Focker,
I'm a patient man.

814
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:39,641
That's what 19 months
in a Vietnamese prison camp
will do to you.

815
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:43,645
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move.

816
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:48,108
And if I find
that you are trying to corrupt
my firstborn child,

817
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,110
I will bring you down, baby.

818
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:52,737
I will bring you down
to Chinatown.

819
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:10,422
Where are we?
I thought we were going
to Kevin's house.

820
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:15,677
- We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.
- Wow!

821
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,972
Oh, this is a crazy house.
Not bad, huh, Dad?

822
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:24,853
Maybe he uses marijuana
for medicinal purposes.
People do that nowadays.

823
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:27,605
Honey, this kid
has been lying to us
from the moment we met him.

824
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,774
Hey, you. Get in some
quality time with the boys?
Hey.

825
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:31,860
Uh-huh, yeah, it was fun.

826
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:35,530
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

827
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:39,576
Why would "B.B.Q
at Best Man's" be weird?
[Doorbell Ringing]

828
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,829
Oh, my God, Greg.
I was sure I told you.

829
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:45,707
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

830
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:49,878
Kevin, your ex-fianc?
Hey!
Welcome, everybody.

831
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,088
I don't understand.
How does he know Bob?

832
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:54,507
[Grunting]

833
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,804
Well, they-- they went
to lacrosse camp together,

834
00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:02,807
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

835
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:05,060
Lacrosse camp?

836
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:08,104
I was really lucky
I was able to salvage
this wood...

837
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:10,273
from an old seamen's chapel
in Nantucket.

838
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:12,650
Oh.
Wow!

839
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,903
Kevin, the house
is amazing.
This is where

840
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:16,905
Maybe you should have
gotten married here.

841
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:20,033
All right, the sun is out,
the grill is hot
and the pool is luke.

842
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:23,578
If I can interest you
in a swim and a little B.B.Q,
just follow me.

843
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,747
All right, Kevo.
Right on schedule.

844
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,583
Bring it on.
Wow. It must cost a fortune
to heat this place.

845
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,752
[Jack]
Wait till you see
the rest of the house.

846
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:38,593
[Carmen Playing
Over The Stereo]

847
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,689
You okay, sweetie?
Yeah.

848
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:53,274
I'm really sorry.
I don't know why
I thought you knew.

849
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,276
It-- It's not
a big deal.

850
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,946
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

851
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:01,616
I think I can handle
an afternoon
with your ex-fianc?

852
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,284
Okay. Thank you.

853
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:07,372
Now, for the floor
that you're walking on,
I chose this Bolivian wormwood.

854
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:12,335
I think it works well in here.
I have the Viking range here
and the twin Sub-Z's.

855
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,964
Yeah, they open up
right there.
Oh, I get it. Like hidden.

856
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,550
Yeah, kind of
blend in.
Great.

857
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:20,635
Are you a homeowner, Greg?

858
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,264
No, no, I rent.
Oh.

859
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:28,143
So, things are going real,
real well for you,
aren't they, eh, Kevo?

860
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:31,062
Gosh, things have been going
so great lately.

861
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:34,899
I got in early on some
wireless I.P.O.s, and the stuff
just skyrocketed from there.

862
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:38,445
- Wow.
- What about you, Greg?
What line of work are you in?

863
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:41,156
- I'm in health care.
- Yeah, so you know
what I'm talking about.

864
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,034
There are a lot
of Benjamins to be made now
with biotech stuff.

865
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,661
I don't have to tell you that.
How's your portfolio?

866
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:49,164
I'd say strong...

867
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,917
to quite strong.

868
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:55,128
You gotta strike
while the iron's hot.

869
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,088
Now's the time.

870
00:54:57,213 --> 00:55:01,509
- Greg's a male nurse.
- That's right.
Thank you, Jack.

871
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,762
[Kevin]
Well, that's great.

872
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:08,016
That's great to give something
back like that. I'd love to
find time to do volunteer work.

873
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,727
Just the other day I saw
this golden retriever that--

874
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:12,854
He had like a gimp,
and he couldn't really--

875
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:15,440
It made me feel terrible.
I wish there was something
I could do.

876
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:19,194
Yeah, well, I get paid,
but also it feels,
you know, good too.

877
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:21,529
So it's kind of
an everybody wins.

878
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:24,282
What are you--
You're like
a Wall Street trader?

879
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:27,702
An investment guy?
No. I mean, I'm willing
to be painted with that brush.

880
00:55:27,827 --> 00:55:29,788
Yes, that's my day job.

881
00:55:31,247 --> 00:55:33,333
We have time?
We got time,
don't we, Jack?

882
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:37,379
I want to show you what
I'm really interested in.
Come on. Let's go.

883
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:43,551
Wow! It looks like
somebody got an "A"
in wood shop.

884
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,595
[Pam, Kevin Laughing]

885
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,557
Yeah, it's always been
kind of a hobby. I whittled
that out of beech wood.

886
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,685
Huh.
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

887
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:54,479
So what got you into,
uh, "carpentering"?
Carpentry?

888
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:57,273
[Snickers]
I guess I'd have
to say Jesus.

889
00:55:57,399 --> 00:56:01,903
He was a carpenter, and I
just figured if you're gonna
follow in someone's footsteps,

890
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,822
who better than Christ?

891
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:06,616
Hmm.

892
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:10,662
Greg's Jewish.

893
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,664
Are you?
Yeah.

894
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:15,333
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, so was J.C.

895
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,335
Wow.
You're in good company.

896
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,963
[Chortles]
Right.

897
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,840
Ahem.

898
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:23,925
Well, I'm gonna head
to the pool,

899
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:27,595
but why don't you
show Greg and Pam
the gift?

900
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,639
[Greg] Wow,
he made a gift.
[Pam] Greg.

901
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:32,225
I put a fresh coat
of lacquer on this
this morning,

902
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,310
so bear with me
with the fumes.

903
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:39,482
Wow. Kev.

904
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:42,235
- Isn't that something?
- That's incredible.

905
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:44,946
Thank you.
Roses.
Deb's favorite.

906
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,824
[Kevin] Yes, right.
It's beautiful. The little
holes are for candles.

907
00:56:47,949 --> 00:56:50,285
[Kevin]
Exactly. And then later,
they'll collect rainfall.

908
00:56:50,368 --> 00:56:53,872
- They make
a tiny birdbath.
- That's great.

909
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:57,125
It's beautiful.
What is it?

910
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,252
It's an altar.

911
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,838
Or you might call it
a "ho-puh."

912
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,343
Isn't that sweet?
Wow.

913
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,470
I'm gonna take it over
to the Byrneses',

914
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:12,307
and tomorrow Robert
and Debra will meet beneath it
to become man and wife.

915
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:15,143
And later,
when they purchase a home,

916
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:17,228
maybe it will
grace their garden.

917
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:21,816
Well, that's my sappy,
romantic idea.
[Chuckles]

918
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:24,319
[Chuckles]

919
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:26,363
Must have taken
forever to build.

920
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:29,157
No, not too bad.
About 70 hours.

921
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,244
Which isn't bad,
considering I carved it all
by hand from one piece of wood.

922
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:36,081
Huh.
[Jack]
Hey, Kevo.

923
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:39,292
12:15. Time to start
the barbecue, big guy.

924
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:42,587
Okay, Mr. B. I better
get back to playing host.

925
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:46,216
Okay, you guys,
grab your suits, and I'll
meet you down at the pool.

926
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:49,761
- I think I'm gonna take
a pass on the swimming.
- Oh, no, you can't.

927
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:53,348
I don't even have a suit
with me. The airline
lost my bag and--

928
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:56,226
[Jack] Pamcake, let's go.
Mom's got your suit here.
Coming, Dad.

929
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,228
You better
get going.

930
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:02,315
Gosh, she's great.
Congratulations, man.

931
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,529
Thank you. And, by the way,
she just had the nicest
things to say about you.

932
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:10,448
Really?
Yeah.

933
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,283
Oh.

934
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:16,538
Gosh. Yeah, we had
some good times together.

935
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:19,374
Boy, she is a tomcat.

936
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:24,671
Whoo.

937
00:58:24,754 --> 00:58:26,881
So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregger.

938
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,926
I'm not gonna swim.
No, come on. I'm not
taking no for an answer.

939
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,723
[Kevin]
Cold buffet is on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

940
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,267
Comin' through here.

941
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,729
[Chattering]

942
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,947
[Kevin] Yeah,
that'd be gre--
Hey, there he is!

943
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:54,409
Get out here.
[Wolf Whistle]

944
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:57,412
G-Man, we got salmon,
we got swordfish.
What's it gonna be?

945
00:58:57,495 --> 00:59:02,959
Ah-- How 'bout
a little of both, K-Dog?
I'm pretty hungry.

946
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,837
I think they call that
"the munchies."

947
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:07,672
[Chuckling]

948
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,842
Let's go.
Hit the ball, Kev!
Show 'em what you got!

949
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,770
Come on, Greg.
Damn!

950
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,688
Come on, team.
He's got nothing.
Come on, Greg.

951
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:26,316
- Service.
- Come on, Greg.

952
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:28,276
[Screaming]

953
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:31,112
- [Glass Breaking]
- Nice serve, pal.

954
00:59:31,237 --> 00:59:35,033
- All right.
- Set!

955
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:38,953
[Jack]
Oh, Greg! Come on!

956
00:59:39,037 --> 00:59:42,123
Whoo! Nice shot,
Maverick!
Sweet setup, Iceman.

957
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,543
[Denny]
Nice one, Nurse.
Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

958
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,837
You gotta rush the net
on defense. Don't be
afraid of the ball.

959
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:50,674
- It's Greg.
- Huddle up, team.

960
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,134
Greg, not Glenn.
Greg is afraid
of the ball.

961
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:56,137
- [Jack] Come on.
This is unacceptable.
- He's gotta go for the ball.

962
00:59:56,221 --> 01:00:00,100
- Here's what we gotta do.
- [Bob] Let's go!
We're gettin' cold in here.

963
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:03,728
We're gettin' creamed.
If Florence Nightingale
over here would play defense.

964
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:06,815
- Larry, I missed one shot.
- It was a big shot.

965
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,150
Larry, keep floatin' where
you are. You're doin' great.

966
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:12,070
Denny, take the deep shots.
Greg, nobody's expecting
much out of you.

967
01:00:12,195 --> 01:00:15,907
- If I set you up with the ball,
can you jump up and spike it?
- [Denny] No.

968
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:17,909
Yeah. I'd have to be
pretty high, but yeah.

969
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:20,412
I bet you would,
Panama Red.
[Snickers]

970
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:22,997
- All right, everybody,
look sharp. Break!
- Let's play some ball.

971
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,834
[Bob]
All right, here we go.

972
01:00:27,627 --> 01:00:29,421
Let's go.
Come on.

973
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,756
[Denny]
Greg!
Set!

974
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:36,678
You gotta
spike those, Focker!
You gotta spike those!

975
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:39,431
- Look how Bob did that.
Nice play, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack.

976
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,726
Fire it up there,
Focker!
Let's do it!

977
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:45,437
- Way to go, Deb!
- Greg!

978
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,273

the matter with you?

982
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:02,037
- Oh, honey! I'm coming!
- [Deb Crying]

983
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,873
[Jack]
Get some ice.

984

Oh, my eye!

[Deb Crying]

986
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,885
[Jack] Pam,
help your sister, please.
I'm sorry, Deb.

987
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,305
Deb, you can totally
see Voit backwards
on your forehead.

988
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,766
- Denny, get outta here!
- You the bandleader?

989
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:25,477
Yes, sir.
Go over the song selection
with Bob. Bob? Bob!

990
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:28,229
[Bob]
Yeah, Jack.
Are you a Mr. Focker?

991
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:31,024
Yes.
Okay.
Sign here, please.

992
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:45,163
Hey, your suitcase.
You go through it,
make sure it's all there?

993
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:47,540
Yeah, it's fine.
What's up?
Good.

994
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:53,713
I just wanna make sure you're
okay since hitting the spike
heard 'round the world.

995
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:56,716
Oh, yeah.
I'm really sorry about that.
It's okay.

996
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:59,594
I don't know
what got into me, Iceman.

997
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:03,556
"Iceman"?
I'm sorry.
Is that a special thing

998
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,059
Stop it.
Stop what, Iceman?

999
01:02:06,184 --> 01:02:08,853
Top Gun was
a very popular movie
when Kevin and I dated.

1000
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:12,857
All right?
That's it.
Hey, Iceman.

1001
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:16,361
Do you want to be Maverick?
Is that what this
is all about?

1002
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:19,364
I can't be Maverick.
Kevin's Maverick.
He used to be,

1003
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:21,741
but we can change that.

1004
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:25,870
Um, can he be Goose?
No, because Goose
dies in the end.

1005
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:28,289
Mmm. Very sad.

1006
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,044
Honey,
I don't really--
Greg, shut up.

1007
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:34,587
Okay.

1008
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:49,769
Jesus, Dad, you ever
think of knocking?
Not in my own den.

1009
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:53,773
What are you two doing
in here?
I'd say rounding

1010
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:59,779
- This is Greg's room, Dad.
- Not anymore. We're gonna
use it for storage.

1011
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:02,907
Greg will stay
in Debbie's room, and she'll
bunk up with you tonight.

1012
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,951
Fine.
Come on, Greg.

1013
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:06,828
- Okay. I'll be right up.
- I'll meet you upstairs.

1014
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:07,871
- Okay. I'll be right up.
- I'll meet you upstairs.

1015
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:11,791
Oh, good.
They found your suitcase.
Yeah.

1016
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:16,004
Hey, Jack, I don't
quite know what happened
back at the tux shop,

1017
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:19,758
but if I've given you
the wrong impression regarding
Pam in any way, I'm sorry.

1018
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:24,804
Okay? I have nothing
but the best intentions
with Pam, and I-I just--

1019
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,932
Actually, there's something
in the suitcase here that
I'm planning on giving her...

1020
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,310
that I think, um,
symbolizes...

1021
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:32,520
[Jiggling Toilet Handle]

1022
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:36,107
the level
of my commitment, uh, to her.
[Toilet Tank Lid Clattering]

1023
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:39,611
And I wouldn't feel right
asking her to wear it...

1024
01:03:39,694 --> 01:03:42,072
without her father's permission.

1025
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:44,157
Jack?

1026
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,284
Did you flush
this toilet?

1027
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,872
Maybe. You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

1028
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,999
I saw little Jinxy
come in last night,

1029
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:55,877
and he took a little squat
and relieved himself.

1030
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:59,673
Jinx knows not to use
that toilet, and even if he did,
he'd never flush it.

1031
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:02,717
- What does it matter?
- The matter, Greg, R.N.,

1032
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:05,053
is that when this toilet
is flushed, it runs,

1033
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:08,848
and when you have a septic tank
that's nearly full and a toilet
that's been running all night,

1034
01:04:08,973 --> 01:04:10,850
then you could have
a hell of a problem.

1035
01:04:10,975 --> 01:04:13,144
Mr. Byrnes?

1036
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,855
[Man]
This is not part
of my job description.

1037
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,274
Nice stench.
You're really on
a roll there, bud.

1038
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:20,360
Bite me, Denny!

1039
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:24,698
In 20 hours, I'm having
a wedding here, so I need
my cesspool pumped now!

1040
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:28,201
- Not tomorrow. Now!
- Dad, what's going on?

1041
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:31,538
Oh, my God!
What's that smell?

1042
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,832
That smell, Bob,
is our shit.

1043
01:04:33,915 --> 01:04:36,835
Focker flushed the toilet
in the den, so the septic tank
is overflowing.

1044
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:39,546
Jack, I told you.
It wasn't me.
It was Jinx.

1045
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,965
Focker, I'm not gonna
tell you again!

1046
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:45,010
Jinx cannot flush the toilet.
He's a cat, for chris sakes!

1047
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:47,929
The animal doesn't
even have thumbs, Focker.

1048
01:04:49,597 --> 01:04:52,225
- Hey, look at this!
- Kevo!

1049
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,394
Over by the tree, right?

1050
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:59,858
No. No, no, no.
Not on the lawn!

1051
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:03,403
Stay where you are.
Not on the lawn!

1052
01:05:03,486 --> 01:05:05,739
- [Pam] Kevin, no!
- No, no, no, no!

1053
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:09,701
- [Screaming]
- Oh!

1054
01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:13,204
- No, no, no!
- Ahh!

1055
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:15,415

1056
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:19,252

1057
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:22,380

I know that's what
I said I wanted,
'cause that's what I wanted.

1062
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:36,811
It is a black
Samsonite suitcase.

1063
01:05:36,936 --> 01:05:40,315
What I'm saying is, do you
think it's possible that
the Samsonite people,

1064
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,402
in some crazy little scheme
to actually turn a profit,
made more than one?

1065
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:46,321
[Woman On Phone]
I don't think so.
You don't?

1066
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:49,908
I am going to need your
baggage claim number again.
Jinx, stop.

1067
01:06:37,872 --> 01:06:41,501
- I know I signed for it.
- I'm looking at your signature
right here, Mr. Focker.

1068
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:44,796
- Do me a favor. Could I
talk to your supervisor?
- Excuse me?

1069
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:47,465
Hmm? What's your name?
Joy.

1070
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:51,302
- Okay, let me talk
to your supervisor.
- My supervisor is on a break.

1071
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:53,972
When he gets back,
have him give me
a call right away.

1072
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:55,974
It's a very important bag.
I'm sure it is, sir.

Jinx.

1075
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:06,985
Don't ask me what it's for.
I need you to do this thing.
[Man] Yeah.

1076
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,821
Please, I'm in
a time situation here,
so just do it. I'll hold on.

1077
01:07:09,946 --> 01:07:13,658
So the name's "Greg Focker"?
I don't know. Greg or Gregory.
Run both names.

1078
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:17,162
Jinx.

1079
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:20,248
Come on. No. Jinx.
Come here. Jinxy.

Jinx. Oh, shit.

1082
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:30,508
Greg didn't ace his med
school boards. He never
even took the goddamn MCATs.

1083
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:34,596
Oh, Jack, that's what you
had your sources check out?

1084
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:37,265
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

1085
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,018
I bet he doesn't even have
a real nursing degree.

1086
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:44,230
A lot of these hospital workers
are just pill poppers looking
for easy access to ludes.

1087
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:47,067
We already know that he's been
puffin' the magic dragon.

1088

was lying.

01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:56,534

1093

The fact is,
Greg lied to you.

1094
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:15,178
He did not lie to me, Dad.
He lied to you when I thought
you should know the truth.

1095
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:17,597
I love you too much
to see you get hurt.

1096
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:22,644
I don't care what
your information says, Dad.

01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:40,889
Whoa!

Wah! Whoa! Whoa!

1112

No, no, no.
No, no, no.

All right, stand back.

Hurry up!

[Dina]
Jinxy! Jinxy!

1124
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:33,733
We checked every yard,
every car on the street.
Nobody's seen him.

1125
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:35,735
He's not up in any
of the trees, Jack.

1126
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,862
We checked all
the bedrooms.
Jinx isn't up here.

1127
01:10:37,987 --> 01:10:40,448
Yeah,
none of the neighbors
have seen him either.

1128
01:10:40,573 --> 01:10:43,743
You tried to milk him,
didn't you,
you sick son of a bitch!

1129
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:45,870
Dad, stop it.
That's enough.

1130
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,581
Honey,
please calm down.
How can I calm down...

1131
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,751
if we're 15 minutes away
from the wedding rehearsal
and the ring bearer's missing?

1132
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:54,963
Whoa. What do you mean,
"the ring bearer"?
Your daddy didn't tell you?

1133
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:58,174
He taught Jinx
to walk down the aisle
with this little pillow.

1134
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,260
Oh, no.
No, you didn't, Dad.

1135
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:03,763
Yeah, yeah. You put this
around the neck, and these
ribbons are for the rings.

1136
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:07,058
[Bob]
That's adorable, Jack.
Oh, for Chris sakes!

1137
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:10,061
That's great, Dad.
Yeah, but now we have
to postpone the rehearsal.

1138
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,897
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, you come with your car.

1139
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:15,233
We're gonna canvass
the neighborhood.
Dee, ask O'Boyle to wait.

1140
01:11:15,358 --> 01:11:18,528
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule the rehearsal
for the morning.

1141
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:22,449
Jack!
No! We cannot cancel the
rehearsal for some stupid cat!

1142
01:11:22,532 --> 01:11:26,745
Stupid cat? How could you
say that? That cat's
been like a brother to you!

1143
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:31,124
We're supposed to let him
wander the streets without
food, water or toilet?

1144
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:35,503
- D-Dad, Greg'll find him.
- What?

1145
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:38,423
- Yeah, what?
- [Dina]
Oh, that's wonderful.

1146
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:43,970
Fine. Fine. Okay.
Denny?

1147
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:46,264
- Denny? Denny? Denny!
- Dad, I'm right here.

1148
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:49,309
Yoo-hoo.
Okay. You're gonna fill in
as the ring bearer for now.

1149
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:54,689
- No. I'm not wearin' that
stupid pillow thing on my head.
- Oh, yes, you damn well will!

1150
01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:00,862
Jinx! Jinx!
Here, Jinx.

1151
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:06,618
You just go and wander
the streets without food,
water or toilet? Fucker!

a little while ago.

There he is.

1155
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:19,130
Holyshit,
that's Jinx.

1156
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:22,258
Jinxy!
Uh, no, let me see
that photo again.

1157
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:24,678
You gotta
picture him without
that stupid Santa cap.

1158
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:28,807
Come on, Jinxy.
Jinxy!
Uh, no.

1159
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:32,727
You see, in the picture,
your cat has an all-black tail.

1160
01:12:32,852 --> 01:12:35,814
Yeah.
And this one
has a white tip.

1161
01:12:35,897 --> 01:12:38,316
No, I'm sorry
about that, chief.

1162
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:42,737
Looks just like him.
Almost.

1163
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:46,116

Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here
on this beautiful day...

1170
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:22,569
to join Dr. Robert Banks
and Debra Byrnes
in holy matrimony.

This is
a special day--

1172
01:13:49,554 --> 01:13:51,639
He found him!
Yea!

1173
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:54,601
It's him!
It's him!

1174
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:57,437
[Bob]
I gotta see this.

1175
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,901
Look, Dad,
it's Jinx.
Oh, my little baby!

1176
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:07,280
We found you. We found you.
Greg, thank you so much.
This is so great.

1177
01:14:07,405 --> 01:14:10,283
[Dina] Where
did you find him?
Gave us a little scare, huh?

1178
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:14,579
Jinxy. Ohh.

1179
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:23,421
Oh

1180
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:28,760
For once in my life
I got someone who needs me

1181
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:32,013
To Greg.
Hooray!

1182
01:14:32,138 --> 01:14:35,266
[Dina]
Honey, where is Greg, anyway?
He's in the restroom.

1183
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:39,312
Yes, I tried there.
I've tried every shelter
on the north shore, okay?

1184
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:44,442
He's a brown-and-black Himalayan
with an all-black tail.

1185
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:49,030
Mr. Jinx. Yeah, okay.
You go check.
I'll call you back.

1187

It's the man
of the hour.
Hey!

1188
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:57,497
Sorry, folks.
Had to pay a little visit
to the urinal fairy.

[Laughing]

1190
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:05,964
Greg, nice work
with the cat today.

1191
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:08,842
Aw, thanks, Jack.
I'm just glad
I could help out.

1192
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,845
We never did get to finish
that little "convo"
back at the den.

1193
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,140
So, when you have a minute,
there is still something
I'd like to talk to you about.

1194
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:18,476
We'll get right to it
as soon as we get back.
You have my word.

1195
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:21,104
I'm gonna
hold you to that.
Circle of trust.

1196
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:24,274

the circle of trust.

and I'll wink at you

1200
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:49,716
I'm your puppet

1201
01:15:49,799 --> 01:15:52,218
Look at Jack!
Whoa!
[Laughing]

1202
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:56,890
Oh, poor Kevin
looks lonely.

1203
01:15:57,015 --> 01:16:00,352
Maybe I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

1204
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:04,481
Sure. I bet he could,
uh, whittle a private little
dance floor for the two of you.

1205
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:06,566
[Chuckles]
I'm serious.

1206
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:09,361
I saw some beech wood outside.
He's very handy.
[Laughing]

1207
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:13,948
He's an extremely handy
and crafty craftsman.

1208
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,034
I shouldn't paint him
with that brush, but--

1209
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:20,955
Come on. Seriously.
Seriously. Part of you wishes
you ended up with him.

1210
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:22,999
Yes, he's very talented,

1211
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:26,086
but it would've
never worked out.

1212
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:28,046
Why not?

1213
01:16:28,171 --> 01:16:30,965
I was never in love
with Kevin.

1214
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:37,222
I'm in love with you.

1215
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,767
That's a good explanation.
Think so?

1216
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:42,769
Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd
like that.

1217
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:44,979
I do.
I'm glad.

1218
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:49,901
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you like
half an hour ago.

1219
01:16:51,444 --> 01:16:56,282

It's Hank MacAtee
from next door.

1226
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:20,432
You'll never guess
who wandered over here
this afternoon. Mr. Jinx.

1227
01:17:20,515 --> 01:17:23,768
Yeah, he's not wearing
his collar, but, uh,
I'm sure it's Jinxy.

1228
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,730
Thought you might be worried,
so just give me a jingle
when you guys get home,

1229
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,940
and I'll bring
the little rascal over.

1230
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:33,737
Okay, well, if you could just
keep checking, please, and I'll
call you back later. Thanks.

- [Sighing]
- Any luck?

1232
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:38,700
No, they're still looking.

1233
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:40,785
Hey, Jack,
this is a great party.

1234
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:45,331
I guess sometimes these things
sort of come together
in their own kooky sort of way.

1235
01:17:45,415 --> 01:17:48,376
Yeah, it's kind of like
the way you found Jinxy.

1236
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:52,297
- You found him at
that animal shelter, huh?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, right.

1237
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,967
- Well, the important thing
is he's home now.
- Yes.

1238
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:58,762
Yeah. You know,
there's something about
that ball of fur...

1239
01:17:58,845 --> 01:18:00,972
that just puts
a big smile on my face.

1240
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:04,517
Mm.
Yeah. You haven't seen any of
his latest tricks, have you?

1241
01:18:04,642 --> 01:18:06,686
No. Hm-mm.

1242
01:18:06,811 --> 01:18:08,730
Well, when we get back,
I'll show you.

1243
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:12,192
We don't have to do it tonight.
He's had a long day.
He's probably tired.

1244
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:15,153
I wouldn't want to--
No, I think he'd like
to show you tonight.

1245
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:16,821
Hmm.

1246
01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:21,034
Why don't you give me
the key and let me drive?

1247
01:18:21,117 --> 01:18:23,036
Hey, Larry.
You know what?
Why don't I drive?

1248
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:25,038
Oh. It's a very
expensive car.
Good idea.

1249
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:27,123
I've always wanted
to test-drive a Benz.

Be my guest, Focker.

01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:34,172
- Hey, sweetie,
what are you doing?
- Larry said I could drive.

1252
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:38,343
Oh.

1253
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:41,513
Let's go. Hurry, hurry.
All right.
Bye, guys.

Get in the car, honey.
Let's go. Hurry up.

1262
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,871
You're a real wild man
at that wheel there.

01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:09,124
[Chattering]

1264
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:11,876
[Larry] You got
your seat belts on back there?
Get your seat belts on.

1265
01:19:17,048 --> 01:19:18,967
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

[Tires Screeching]

1267
01:19:21,928 --> 01:19:23,888
You're driving
like a maniac!
Focker,

1268
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:27,434
Benz drives like
a dream, Lar.
Let's not

1269
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:30,478
Whoo.
Oh.

1270
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:32,564
Oh, there's Jack.

1271
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:37,444
Hey, Jackie.

Let's play.

[Engine Rumbling,

1275
01:19:48,788 --> 01:19:50,749
[Linda]
Okay, now, Greg? Greg?

1276
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:54,252
- [Linda] Greg, no!
- [Larry]
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

01:19:59,382 --> 01:20:01,343
Is everything okay,
honey?

1280
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:04,429
Yeah, just trying
to make good time.
Oh.

1281
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:06,556
What the heck
is the matter with you?

1282
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,641
All right.
We're gonna be home.
We're gonna get home.

1283
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:15,940
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1284
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:18,568
It's not the autobahn.
Come on, Greg!

Jesus!

1287
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:27,619
[Linda] Maybe you should
drive after all, honey.
We're okay.

1288
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:36,002
All right.

1289
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:44,636
Oh, no.
No, please.

1290
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:49,015
Yes!
[Bob]
Jack just turned.

1291
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,519
You were supposed
to make that left
at the light,

1292
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:54,562
Focker.

1293
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,690
[Debbie]
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1294
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:59,359
[Denny]
Where does he think
he's going?

1295
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:03,363
[Bob]
Home, home, home.
[Debbie] What a fun ride.

1296
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:05,907
Who gave him
the keys?
[Laughing]

1297
01:21:06,032 --> 01:21:09,160
Okay, we're out.
Yeah, we've had
enough excitement.

1298
01:21:09,285 --> 01:21:11,246
[Larry]
I wonder if he
has a license.

1299
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,915
[Bob] Yeah,
a license to kill.

1300
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,251

1301
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,004

Come on, everybody.

[Bob]
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1303
01:21:22,298 --> 01:21:24,718
You're a lunatic!
[Chattering, Laughing]

1304
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:26,845
Come on,
Linda!

1305
01:21:26,928 --> 01:21:29,597

Hey, hey!
[Dina Laughing]

1306
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:31,683
Whoo-hoo!

01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:36,312
[Screaming]

1308
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:39,315
- [Larry]
What in the world--
- [Debbie] Oh, my--

1309
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,651
- [All Talking At Once]
- Oh, the dress!

1310
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:44,112
It was the cat!
Goddamn you!

1311
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:46,448
Dad, Dad--
Dad! Dad!
Jinx, I'm gonna--

1312
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:48,199
- [Shrieking]
- Calm down!

1313
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:51,911
- Where's the cat?
- [Bob] Cat got out!
Cat got out, Jack!

1314
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:01,963
[Sniffing]
You spray-painted his tail...

1315
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:04,549
to make him look like Jinxy,
didn't you, Focker?

1316
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:07,469
Greg, what's he
talking about?

1317
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:11,556
Hank MacAtee called me
a couple of hours ago
and told me he found Jinxy.

1318
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:13,767
He took his collar
and put it on an impostor.

1319
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:17,437
Then he spray-painted his tail,
and then he tried
to beat us back here...

1320
01:22:17,562 --> 01:22:20,231
so that he could
get rid of the evidence.

1321
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:23,318
Oh, no.

1322
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:26,279
Please tell me
that's not true, Greg.

1323
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:30,742
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find
the real Jinx.

1324
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:36,373
[Sighing]
How could you do
something like that?

1325
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:40,293
- I'm sorry.
- What are you going
to tell me next?

1326
01:22:40,418 --> 01:22:43,546
That you set Kevin's
altar on fire?
[Nervous Chuckle]

1327
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,175
Oh, my God.

1328
01:22:49,469 --> 01:22:53,014
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was chasing Jinx
up onto the roof.

1329
01:22:53,139 --> 01:22:56,267
I had a smoke, and I think
I might have lit
something that--

1330
01:22:58,186 --> 01:23:02,482
I don't know what happened.
He put so much goddamn lacquer
on that thing.

1331
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:04,693
It was an accident
waiting to happen.

1332
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:07,821
This is very
disappointing, Greg.

1333
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:14,494
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

1334
01:23:16,621 --> 01:23:18,623
So you lied to me
about everything, huh, Greg?

1335
01:23:18,748 --> 01:23:21,376
You lied about the cat,
about the fire, about the MCATs.

1336
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:24,713
I didn't lie
about the MCATs. Don't you
see what's happening here?

1337
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:27,799
- Your dad has totally
turned you against me.
- I didn't turn her against you.

1338
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:29,843
You did that
to yourself.

1339
01:23:31,845 --> 01:23:35,390
Jack, please.
You didn't like me from
the second I walked in here.

1340
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:38,351
I'm a very
accepting person, Focker.

1341
01:23:38,476 --> 01:23:40,478
All I ask for
is honesty.

1342
01:23:40,603 --> 01:23:43,481
Oh, honesty?

1343
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:46,109
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty, Jack?

1344
01:23:46,192 --> 01:23:48,194
Okay, let's talk
a little truth and honesty.

1345
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:53,074
Let's talk a little
"Operation Ko Samui," Jack.

1346
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,160
What's he
talking about, Dad?

1347
01:23:55,285 --> 01:23:57,704
Yeah, that's weird,
'cause I thought there
weren't any secrets...

1348
01:23:57,787 --> 01:23:59,873
inside the circle
of trust, Jack.

1349
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:03,001
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You don't? Huh?

1350
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:05,420
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1351
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:07,505
Hey, Pam, guess what.

1352
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:11,593
Daddy's planning a little
covert operation in Thailand
for the day after the wedding.

1353
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:14,095
You are?

1354
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,181
Round and round
we go, Jack. Hey.

1355
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:18,224
I bet everybody would love
to hear about your rendezvous...

1356
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,226
in the parking lot
of the Oyster Bay
Drug and Sundry.

1357
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:24,064
You know what I'm talking about.
Where the guy gave you
the passports and the documents.

1358
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:27,025
Or how about
your little phone call in Thai?

1359
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:29,444
[Scoffs]
Jack can't talk Thai.
Oh, no, Dina.

1360
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:33,698
Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talk Thai very well.

1361
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:36,868
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad
is not retired.

1362
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:40,121
He's still very much
in the C.I.A.

1363
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:44,417
Daddy.
What--
He's right.

1364
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:48,380
He's right.
[Stammering]
My cover's blown.

1365
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:50,382
I-l-I am planning...

1366
01:24:50,548 --> 01:24:52,926
a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

1367
01:24:53,009 --> 01:24:57,347
- What?
- A surprise honeymoon
for Deb and Bob.

1368
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:00,433
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

1369
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,060
What?

1370
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:04,979
Ko Samui is an island
off the coast of Thailand!

1371
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:08,733
That guy I was meeting
in the parking lot is
Thor Svenson, my travel agent.

1372
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:11,569
- He was giving me
their visas.
- [Gasping]

1373
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:16,783
Wow, Thailand.
Thanks a lot, J.B.
That's something.

1374
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:19,077
Don't mention it.
I just, um--

1375
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,830
You know, if this nursing
thing doesn't work out,
Focker,

1376
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:24,666
I'd say you definitely
have a career in espionage.

1377
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:26,668
[Snickering]

1378
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,046
Thanks, Greg.

1379
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:06,875
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.

1380
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:13,548
I guess you're gonna stay here.

1381
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,220
Pam, l--

1382
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:54,464
- Gaylord M. Focker?
- Gaylord? Gaylord?

1383
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:57,550
Yeah,
that's me.

1384
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:00,178
- I thought
your name was Greg.
- It is.

1385
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:02,222
That's not what it says
on the form.
I know.

1386
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:05,058
It's my legal name.
Nobody's called me by it
since I was in third grade.

1387
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:07,060
[Denny Snickering]

1388
01:27:07,185 --> 01:27:09,354
[Deliveryman]
Whatever.

1389
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:14,442
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So your name's Gay Focker?

1390
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:20,365
[Laughing]

1391
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:22,909
Denny.
I'm sorry.
It's just it's not

1392
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:24,953
[Laughing]

1393
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:28,039
Come on. Now look
what you've done.
Oh, P-Pammy.

1394
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:30,291
[Denny]
Don't--
Don't go away.

1395
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:07,245
You're in luck.
There is room.

1396
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:11,291
[Keys Clacking]

1397
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:17,005
And without
a Saturday stay-over,
that fare difference will be...

1398
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:21,259
$1,137.11 .

1399
01:28:23,636 --> 01:28:27,098
Would you want me
to book you the seat?
Okay. All right.

1400
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:30,310
Did you want to check
any bags today?

1401
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:15,397
We should be all right
with only one usher,
don't you think?

1402
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:18,983
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1403
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:27,158
Thought you might
like to see this.

1404
01:29:35,917 --> 01:29:39,004
- How did you get this?
- Oh, I have my sources too.

1405
01:29:43,466 --> 01:29:47,554
I called Gaylord,
a.k.a. Greg's parents
in Detroit.

1406
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:51,016
They saved his SAT scores too,
in case you're interested.

1407
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:54,978
Oh, honey. It--
That doesn't matter if he
did well on some test.

1408
01:29:55,061 --> 01:29:57,147
What does that prove?
Look at this place!

1409
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:59,983
He almost destroyed the wedding
because he lied!

1410
01:30:01,943 --> 01:30:04,696
I love you, Dad,

1411
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:07,866
but you can be
a real jerk sometimes.

1412
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:14,539
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough
for Pam.

1413
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:17,000
Who is, Jack?

1414
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:20,378
Nobody has ever been
good enough for your Pam.

1415
01:30:25,258 --> 01:30:30,597
I mean, do you realize that you
never even warmed up to Kevin
until she broke up with him?

1416
01:30:30,722 --> 01:30:34,351
Maybe it's time
you think about
what Pam wants.

1417
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:51,910
Greg, it's me.

1418
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:53,953
I'm sure you're in
the air by now,

1419
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:57,582
so I guess you'll just
get this when you get home.

1420
01:30:57,707 --> 01:31:00,210
Uh--

1421
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:02,170
Listen, I am so sorry.

1422
01:31:03,254 --> 01:31:05,340
I acted like
a complete idiot,

1423
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:08,093
and I hope that you
can forgive me.

1424
01:31:09,469 --> 01:31:13,556
I mean, I-I don't care about
the fire or the cat or--

1425
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:20,063
I mean, I can't believe you
actually spray-painted a cat.

1426
01:31:20,146 --> 01:31:24,234
That's actually really gross,
but th-the point is that--

1427
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,905
that I understand
why you did it, and--

1428
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:30,990
and I love you.

1429
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:34,786
I want you to know
that I really-- I really,
really love you, and, uh--

1430
01:31:37,997 --> 01:31:41,167
When you get this,
will you please call me?

1431
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:43,670
Okay. Bye.

Affirmative.

Thanks.

1440

Hello.

1441
01:32:18,204 --> 01:32:22,083
Oh, I'm sorry. We're only
boarding rows nine and above
right now. You'll have to wait.

1442
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:25,045
Well, I'm in row eight.

1443
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:27,213
Please step aside, sir.

1444
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:29,382
It's just one row.
Don't you think
it's okay if l--

1445
01:32:29,507 --> 01:32:32,093
We'll call your row
momentarily.

1446
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,513
Step aside, sir.

1447
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,119
Hmm.

1448
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:03,541
Thank you for waiting.
We'd like to continue
boarding the aircraft now.

1449
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:06,544
We're now boarding all rows,
please. All remaining rows.

1450
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,428
Mm, hello.

1451
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:20,100
Mm-hmm.

[Horn Honking]

1454
01:33:36,116 --> 01:33:38,118
Excuse me.

1455
01:33:40,203 --> 01:33:42,747
Okay, where's the fire, huh?

1456
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:49,087
[Woman]
Will you hand me
that pillow over there?

1457
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,923
- I'm sorry, sir. You're
gonna have to check that.
- I got it.

1458
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:54,676
No, I'm sorry.
That bag won't fit.
No, I'm not-- Hey.

1459
01:33:54,801 --> 01:33:57,595
- I'm not checking my bag, okay?
- There's no need
to raise your voice, sir.

1460
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:01,266
I'm not raising my voice.
This would be raising
my voice to you, okay?

1461
01:34:01,391 --> 01:34:05,979
I don't want to check my bag.
By the way, your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

1462
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:08,064
Because I already did that once,
and you lost it,

1463
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:10,358
and then I had everything
screwed up very badly for me.

1464
01:34:10,483 --> 01:34:12,485
Okay?
I can assure you
that your bag...

1465
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,487
will be placed
safely below deck
with the other luggage.

1466
01:34:14,612 --> 01:34:18,033
Oh, yeah? How do you know
my bag will be safe below
with the other luggage?

1467
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,118
Are you physically gonna
take my bag beneath the plane?

1468
01:34:20,243 --> 01:34:23,663
Are you gonna go
with the guys with the earmuffs
and put it in there?

1469
01:34:23,788 --> 01:34:26,833
- No.
- No? Okay. Then shut
your pie hole...

1470
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:29,961
and listen to me
when I say that lam finished...

1471
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:33,506
with the checking-of-the-bags
conversation!

1472
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:37,302
Sir, we have a policy
on this airline that if
a bag is this large, we--

1473
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:40,013
Get your grubby little paws
off of my bag, okay?

1474
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:43,350
It's not like I have
a bomb in here. It's not like
I want to blow up the plane.

1475
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:46,728
- Sir!
- I wanna stow my bag according
to your safety regulations.

1476
01:34:46,853 --> 01:34:48,980
- Sir, sir--
- If you would take a second...

1477
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:52,150
and take the little sticks
out of your head
and clean out your ears,

1478
01:34:52,233 --> 01:34:54,194
maybe you would see that
I'm a person who has feelings,

1479
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:56,321
and all I have to do
is do what I wanna do!

1480
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:59,366
All I wanna do
is hold onto my bag
and not listen to you!

1481
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:03,328
The only way that I would ever
let go of my bag would be if you
came over here now...

1482
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:05,663
and tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers.

1483
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:09,709
Okay? If you can get it
from my kung fu grip,
then you can have it.

1484
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:12,337
Okay? Otherwise,
step off, bitch.

1486
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:17,217
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1487
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,761
You got him?
Yeah.
Ow!

1488
01:35:26,726 --> 01:35:30,730
Hey. Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended.
Tow it.

1489
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:33,274
I've got a plane full of people
saying you threatened
that stewardess.

1490
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,195
I was not threatening her.
I was trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing.

1491
01:35:37,278 --> 01:35:39,864
You were acting like a maniac,
and you threatened her
with a bomb!

1492
01:35:39,989 --> 01:35:42,075
- I said I didn't
have a bomb!
- You said "bomb."

1493
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,078
- I said, "It's not
like I have a bomb."
- You said "bomb" on an airplane.

1494
01:35:45,161 --> 01:35:48,456
- What's wrong with saying
"bomb" on an airplane?
- You can't say "bomb."

1495
01:35:48,581 --> 01:35:52,627
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!
You gonna arrest me?

1496
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:55,714
- You assaulted
an airline employee--
- What if I was a bombardier?

1497
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:58,133
- I got enough to put you away
for a few years!
- Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!

1498
01:35:58,133 --> 01:35:58,967
- I got enough to put you away
for a few years!
- Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!

1499

We got a specialist here.

1500
01:36:03,805 --> 01:36:06,016
Bye, Norm.

1501
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:14,107
Oh, shit.
How'd you get here?

1502
01:36:14,232 --> 01:36:16,317
I'm everywhere, Focker.

1503
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:18,319
I didn't
do anything, Jack.

1504
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:22,407
Yeah, I know.
Well, then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

1505
01:36:22,532 --> 01:36:26,286
Listen, Focker. I'm not
gonna tell anybody anything
until you answer some questions.

1506
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:29,289
Unless you want to spend
the next couple of years
of your life in prison,

1507
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,416
you better goddamn well
tell me the truth.

1508
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:34,085
No more lies.
You understand?
No more lies.

1509
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:36,296
Did you do this?
Just answer
the questions.

1510
01:36:36,421 --> 01:36:38,882
Did you have me taken off
of that airplane?
Just answer the question.

1511
01:36:38,965 --> 01:36:41,092

over there.

Yes or no?

Yes.
Are you
a male nurse?

1515
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:55,023
Yes.
Are you a pothead?

1516
01:36:55,148 --> 01:36:57,108
No.
Have you ever
smoked pot?

1517
01:36:57,192 --> 01:36:59,110
Yes.

1518
01:36:59,194 --> 01:37:02,155
Did you spray-paint the tail
of a cat to pass him off
as Mr. Jinx?

1519
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:03,948
Yes.

1520
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,076
Did you do that
because you desperately
were seeking my approval?

1521
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:09,120
Yes.
Because you love
my daughter Pam?

1522
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:11,956
Yes.
Do you wanna
marry her?

1523
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:16,002
Do you want
to marry her?

1524
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:22,133
I did,
until I met you.

1525
01:37:22,217 --> 01:37:24,386
What does that mean?

1526
01:37:24,511 --> 01:37:28,848
I love your daughter, Jack.
I love her more than anything.

1527
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:32,519
But frankly, sir,
I'm a little terrified
of being your son-in-law.

1528
01:37:32,644 --> 01:37:35,397
This whole weekend
has given me a lot of doubts...

1529
01:37:35,522 --> 01:37:38,191
about whether or not
I could even survive
in your family.

1530
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,240
I think you've got
some serious issues.

1531
01:37:46,741 --> 01:37:49,911
If I lighten up, would you
consider marrying my daughter?

1532
01:37:50,036 --> 01:37:51,996
Would you lighten up a lot?

1533
01:37:53,164 --> 01:37:55,417
- Yeah.
- Yes or no?

1534
01:37:55,542 --> 01:37:57,669
- Yes.
- Would you let
me and Pam...

1535
01:37:57,752 --> 01:38:00,422
Live our lives and not
interfere all the time?

1536
01:38:00,547 --> 01:38:02,424
I promise not interfere
in your lives all the time.

1537
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:04,884
Will you stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

1538
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:08,680
Could you at least try, maybe,
to consider another profession?

1539
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:10,515
-Jack, yes or no?
- Ever?

1540
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,184
- No!
- Okay, yes.

1541
01:38:13,309 --> 01:38:15,270
Would you let me and Pam
sleep in the same room?

1542
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:17,522
Don't push it, Focker.

1543
01:38:17,647 --> 01:38:20,358
You're in
a real mess.

1544
01:38:21,818 --> 01:38:23,778
If you married my daughter,
would you support her...

1545
01:38:23,903 --> 01:38:25,947
in the way that she
deserves to be supported?

1546
01:38:26,072 --> 01:38:29,868
- Yes.
- Would you be honest
and faithful to her?

1547
01:38:29,993 --> 01:38:31,745
Yes.

1548
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:36,249
Will you devote yourself
entirely to her
for the rest of your life?

1549
01:38:36,374 --> 01:38:38,460
Of course.

I thought you were
going back to Chicago?

1555
01:39:11,409 --> 01:39:14,704
Yeah, well, we had
a little plane trouble.

1556
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:16,831
Plus, your dad
caught up with me
at the airport.

1557
01:39:16,956 --> 01:39:18,833
No. Don't worry.

1558
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:21,920
It's okay. We worked out
a lot of our issues.

1559
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:25,131
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?
Mm-hmm.

1560
01:39:25,256 --> 01:39:29,094
Yeah. First he gave me his
little human lie detector thing,
but I passed.

1561
01:39:29,177 --> 01:39:31,137
Good.

1562
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:33,682
Yeah, and...

1563
01:39:34,974 --> 01:39:37,018
then he proposed.

1564
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:42,607
Are you feeling all right?

01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:47,445

was a nightmare.

elaborate plan,

somewhere between
giving your sister
a black eye...

1568
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:58,289
and setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.
