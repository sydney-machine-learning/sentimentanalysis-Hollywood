1
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,326
Basic principles:

2
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,489
No woman wakes up saying:

3
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,758
"God, I hope I don't get
swept off my feet today."

4
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,233
Now, she might say,
"This is a really bad time for me."

5
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:06,710
Or something like, "I just need some space."

6
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,880
Or my personal favorite:

7
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,717
"I'm really into my career right now."

8
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,385
You believe that? Neither does she.

9
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:23,431
You know why?
Because she's lying to you, that's why.

10
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,694
You understand me? Lying.

11
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:31,268
It's not a bad time for her.
She doesn't need any space.

12
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,273
She may be into her career...

13
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,073
but what she's really saying is,
"Get away from me now."

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,040
Or possibly, "Try harder, stupid."

15
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,849
Well, which one is it?

16
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:49,187
60% of all human communication
is nonverbal.

17
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,049
Body language.

18
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:53,186
30% is your tone.

19
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:57,426
So that means that
90% of what you're saying...

20
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,033
ain't coming out of your mouth.

21
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,099
Toby!

22
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:06,733
Shit!

23
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:08,140
Of course she'll lie to you.

24
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:11,042
She's a nice person,
she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings.

25
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,775
What else is she gonna say?
She doesn't even know you.

26
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:14,975
Yet.

27
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,654
Luckily, the fact is
that just like the rest of us...

28
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,159
even a beautiful woman doesn't know
what she wants until she sees it.

29
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,089
And that's where I come in.

30
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,392
My job is to open her eyes.

31
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,234
Oh, my God!

32
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,498
Is this what you're looking for?

33
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:43,511
Basic principles: No matter what,
no matter when, no matter who...

34
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:47,139
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet.

35
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,347
Just needs the right broom.

36
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,092
You cannot use what you do not have.

37
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:04,189
So if you're shy, be shy.
If you're outgoing, be outgoing.

38
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,768
- I'm not outgoing.
- That's okay.

39
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,328
She may not want the whole truth,
but she does want the real you.

40
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,840
She may not want to see it all at once,
but she does want to see it.

41
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:18,778
So tonight, when you're wondering what
to say, how you look, or if she likes you...

42
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,851
just remember, she is already out with you.

43
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:26,349
That means she said yes
when she could have said no.

44
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:30,492
That means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off.

45
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,688
So that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you.

46
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,766
It is your job not to mess it up.

47
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:43,631
The shoes are hot.
You went to the place I told you?

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,268
Yeah, but I don't think they're really me.

49
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:52,112
"You" is a very fluid concept right now.

50
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,776
You bought the shoes.
You look great in the shoes.

51
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,682
That's the you I'm talking about.

52
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,287
The key tonight is hang back.

53
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,352
Give her plenty of space.

54
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,022
If she lingers at a photograph, move on.

55
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,992
But maintain the visual.

56
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:22,708
It's supposed to be 64 and clear tonight.
So when you leave the club, walk a little.

57
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,144
Ask her what she thought about the show...

58
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,978
what was her favorite photograph,
why that one.

59
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,485
And when she answers,
don't be looking at her mouth.

60
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:34,250
Don't be wondering
what she looks like naked.

61
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,848
Listen to what she is saying and respond.

62
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,752
Listen and respond.

63
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,228
That way, when it's your turn to talk...

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,267
you'll have something better to say than,
"I like your mouth."

65
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:48,666
What was your favorite one?

66
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:51,565
The elephant, definitely.

67
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,370
And all of a sudden,
we're on date number two.

68
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,374
Ready.

69
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,582
No way.

70
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,351
We're going back in there.
You have to smile.

71
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:15,256
In case you didn't go to high school,
hitting is a good thing.

72
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,923
So how does it happen, great love?

73
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,091
Are you okay?

74
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,862
- Nobody knows.
- I'm good.

75
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,303
Let me get a Bomb Pop
and a Screwball for the lady.

76
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,706
But what I can tell you,
is that it happens in the blink of an eye.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,571
One moment, you're enjoying your life.

78
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,880
And the next, you're wondering
how you ever lived without them.

79
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:41,215
Three dates is all I need.

80
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:45,784
Three dates, and I'll get you here,
to the high-stakes medal round...

81
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,921
where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss...

82
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,900
will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship.

83
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,798
After that, you're on your own.

84
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,333
But always remember...

85
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,662
life is not the amount of breaths you take.

86
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:35,368
It's the moments that take your breath away.

87
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:42,048
Did I call it or did I call it?

88
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,345
I mean, what did I say, six months?

89
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,216
And when was her first date?

90
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:49,348
So five-and-a-half?
God, I hate it when I'm right.

91
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,121
What is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks...

92
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,562
even when they're going out with
someone as awesome as Allegra Cole?

93
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,463
She's only the most fabulous thing
walking around New York.

94
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:00,627
Thanks, Young.

95
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:03,035
Are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna run it.

96
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,573
Why should she waste her heart
on some Swedish aristo-brat?

97
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,677
Even if he is gorgeous.

98
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,512
If he's stupid enough to cheat...

99
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:13,047
the world should know
he's dumb enough to get caught.

100
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,582
Exactly. I'm in the elevator.
See you in a minute.

101
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,845
Good morning, how are you?

102
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,018
Bitter, party of one.

103
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:22,653
You should try it sometime.

104
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,024
Barbados by myself?
I wouldn't last five minutes.

105
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,926
It was just what the doctor ordered.

106
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:31,522
I slept in, I did my yoga,
I read a couple of books...

107
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,329
flirted with my scuba instructor.

108
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:36,530
- And apparently never left the office.
- I know, isn't that great?

109
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,766
You should've taken someone with you.

110
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,035
Who am I gonna take with me?

111
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,408
This is where a boyfriend comes in handy.

112
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:48,006
- I don't have time for a boyfriend.
- You said that two years ago.

113
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:51,086
Yes, and it's as true today as it was then.

114
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,114
I thought you were on vacation.

115
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,589
See if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour.

116
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,095
Besides, relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along.

117
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,528
Spoken like a true cynic.

118
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,765
I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist.

119
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,362
You are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist.

120
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:13,101
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

121
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,766
She works here, remember?

122
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,539
No, she doesn't. Not for another four days.

123
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,444
- This couldn't wait.
- It could.

124
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,447
What are you doing? Go back to the beach.

125
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,417
- I don't want you here.
- No, really, you do.

126
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,546
You are becoming
a sick, workaholic lunatic...

127
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:29,352
and this is exactly...

128
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,623
the kind of nervous, overwrought behavior
that leads to...

129
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,596
Pictures of Sebby with a busty brunette.

130
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,629
A very big raise.

131
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:43,237
Jesus. You could find dirt in a snowstorm.

132
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,273
Comes with the job.

133
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:50,072
You know, kiddo, there is more to life
than watching other people live it.

134
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:52,978
Can I help he was cheating on my beach?

135
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,641
I think it's great
that you're so good at your job.

136
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,413
I'm just a little worried as to why.

137
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,881
Let me worry about that.

138
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:05,250
Okay. I want that column on my desk
by lunch.

139
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:06,726
So you'll pay for my hotel?

140
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,265
For you to sip mai tais?
I don't think so. Get out.

141
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,178
- Come on.
- What?

142
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,746
- That's good, right?
- No.

143
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,440
No, it was in and it freaked out.

144
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,577
You know what your problem is, Hitch?
You're all about the short game.

145
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,488
You pick your shots
based on what you see first...

146
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:40,158
not what's necessarily best for you...

147
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,957
in the long run.

148
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:48,102
All of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby.

149
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:51,765
You know, I'm very happy for you.
Just not meant for everybody.

150
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,809
So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty...

151
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:58,142
totally varied, wildly experimental
short game.

152
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:02,347
- I was talking about pool, but whatever.
- Yeah, okay.

153
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,215
Honestly, I just hope one day
you're able to experience...

154
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,051
the unconditional love, trust,
and openness...

155
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,057
that I share with Grace every single day.

156
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,823
- Is this really barroom talk?
- You need to listen to me. I'm serious.

157
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,627
Because when you get to a place
with a woman like that...

158
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,564
it's so beyond anything physical that...

159
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,364
when I think back to
when I used to run around with you...

160
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,474
and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women...

161
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:30,545
I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic.

162
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,713
Yeah, I see what you mean. That's pathetic.

163
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,559
So, how'd you meet him?

164
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,597
I was in La Perla
just buying some weekend thongs.

165
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,257
- And he was doing likewise?
- No.

166
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,670
Actually, he said he was buying something
for his mom.

167
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,068
His mom?

168
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:00,035
Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie
for their mother?

169
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,441
Well, maybe he was looking for a robe.

170
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:07,112
Casey, he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman.

171
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:11,780
- I prefer the mother story.
- I know you do, but that's not the point.

172
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,186
No, the point is I'm not gonna start out
assuming the guy's a liar.

173
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,919
- Why not?
- Because that's how you wind up...

174
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,253
Like me? Is that what you were gonna say?

175
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,865
No. I was gonna say, "Like you."

176
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,201
- What's his name?
- Why?

177
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,070
- I'm gonna Google him.
- No. Google your own guy.

178
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,140
Let's just see if his mother's still alive.

179
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,209
- So when is Grace due again?
- Soon.

180
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,204
- You excited?
- What'd you say?

181
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:40,107
Do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here?

182
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:41,409
No, don't do that.

183
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:45,544
Are you saying you don't wanna talk to them
because you can't go home with them?

184
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,885
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

185
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,720
- Have you heard of the Date Doctor?
- Urban myth.

186
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:52,088
- Really?
- Absolutely.

187
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,822
I was hoping he also helped women.

188
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,989
Casey, you're not sick. You're single.

189
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,598
You just have to relax and enjoy the ride.

190
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,932
I haven't been ridden in months.

191
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:09,967
On that happy note, I'm gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight.

192
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,307
- You mean, besides me.
- Right.

193
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:13,938
Bye.

194
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,450
I'll go get those girls,
bring them over here...

195
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:18,782
and we'll have a conversation
like human beings.

196
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:22,619
Then you're gonna home,
and I'll take them back to my apartment.

197
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:27,185
Well, that sounds like fun for me.
But you might want to get in line, pal.

198
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,197
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, how are you?

199
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:36,166
Hey, baby, can I get a couple Coronas
at the pool table, please? Thanks.

200
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,670
Excuse me.

201
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,174
Lime wedges in the bottle's fine.

202
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,677
Hey, asshole, I don't work here.

203
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:53,922
I'm sorry. The paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth, sweetheart.

204
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,321
Just don't let it happen again.

205
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,984
- I knew you didn't work here.
- You did?

206
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:02,586
How else was I supposed to get you away
from all those guys?

207
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,597
Why would you want to do that?

208
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,504
Some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex.

209
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,539
They like women, women like them.
Everything flows naturally.

210
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,938
Back in college, I was just not one of them.

211
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,320
I seemed to lack the basic understanding...

212
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,981
that my peers just intuitively grasped.

213
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,652
But like any late bloomer,
I was eager to make up for lost time.

214
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,625
Her name was Cressida Baylor.

215
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,730
Can you tell me
where the registration building is?

216
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,676
And my life would never be the same.

217
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:51,246
- I'm Alex.
- Cressida.

218
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,983
What we had was beautiful.

219
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,191
I love you.

220
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,725
I love you so much.

221
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,596
I love you, too, Alex.

222
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:21,033
I know you don't love me
as much as I love you.

223
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:25,011
But that's okay.
I'm just glad you love me at all.

224
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,447
In retrospect,
I guess I may have come on a little strong.

225
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:35,055
But the experience taught me a lot.

226
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,454
Cressida!

227
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,024
What are you doing?

228
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,530
I'm sorry, Alex.

229
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:48,035
But I love you. What did I do wrong?
Just tell me what I did wrong.

230
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,296
You're doing it right now.

231
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,934
Alex, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:56,512 --> 00:15:00,710
And it's an education
I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men.

233
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,750
Because with no guile and no game,
there's no girl.

234
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,786
If ever a man born was without game...

235
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,421
it was Albert Brennaman.

236
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:45,757
My business is 100% referral
and, thus far, untraceable.

237
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,692
And if there's one thing I've learned...

238
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,527
when you orchestrate, coordinate,
and otherwise mess with fate...

239
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,135
it's best to fly under the radar.

240
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,574
I hope she's single
'cause I don't do break-ups.

241
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,678
Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

242
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,237
Yeah, no.
I mean, she just got out of a relationship.

243
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:43,742
Is that a problem?
Because if it is, that's fine.

244
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:46,184
I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway.

245
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:50,520
Definitely been hurt a lot.
I had a lot of bad experiences.

246
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:54,084
Some good ones.
But definitely a lot of bad ones.

247
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:58,893
I'm desperate, basically.
I mean, not in general, you understand?

248
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:02,731
You know, not just for anybody.
But, man, for her... Yeah.

249
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:05,571
Why don't you tell me about her?

250
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,836
Let's see, what can I say?

251
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:12,841
My company handles her finances.
I'm her tax consultant.

252
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,681
Well, I'm one of them.
I'm the junior man on the account.

253
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,219
- So does she know you're interested?
- No.

254
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,552
Alive?

255
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,095
I lent her my pen once.

256
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:29,894
Shoot. Does anyone have a pen?

257
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:33,524
- Here, take mine.
- Albert, you're crushing my arm.

258
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,161
Sorry about that. Here you go, Allegra.

259
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,071
Allegra? As in Allegra Cole?

260
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,941
Yeah, I realize that I'm not her usual type.

261
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,880
Well, her last boyfriend owned Sweden
or something.

262
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,713
And that guy was a bum.

263
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,879
He didn't seem like
a very nice person to me.

264
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,949
You swing for the fence.

265
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,527
Look, you don't think I tried
talking myself out of this?

266
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:04,463
I mean, you don't think I know
how ridiculous this is? I know, okay?

267
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,036
I just thought that maybe with your help...

268
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:14,098
You know what?
I'm really sorry I wasted your time.

269
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,580
Hold on a second, Albert.

270
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:34,221
You know what it's like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless?

271
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,922
Feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man?

272
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,936
But at the same time,
hoping that she still finds happiness...

273
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,272
even if it's never gonna be with you?

274
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,441
You are flat-out...

275
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:54,476
out of your mind. You know that?

276
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,820
That's good.

277
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,116
It is?

278
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,424
You ever heard of Michelangelo?

279
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,757
Heard of the Sistine Chapel?

280
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,765
Michelangelo.

281
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,258
Sistine Chapel.

282
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,265
You saying you can do this?

283
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:18,932
My name is Alex Hitchens.
Let's go paint that ceiling.

284
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,904
Take it easy.

285
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,706
Oh, my God!

286
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,112
Well, it looks like I'm still rich.

287
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,094
But what I would really like,
and what I was wondering is...

288
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:54,460
if I could have $500,000
to invest on my own.

289
00:20:56,472 --> 00:21:00,568
And what were you thinking
of investing in, Allegra?

290
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:06,707
Well, it's something
that I really have a passion for.

291
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:15,120
Daydreams are for private time.

292
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,721
When you're in the room, be in the room.

293
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:21,455
Concentrate. Focus.
Women respond when you respond to them.

294
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,496
My friend Maggie is a talented designer.

295
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:29,267
I've seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic.

296
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:34,401
And I would really like to get involved.

297
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,675
I'll tell you what.

298
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:45,480
Let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in...

299
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:49,216
and next month,
we'll run the whole lot of them by you.

300
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:53,316
Okay.

301
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,953
Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen.

302
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:59,092
Let's go over this one more time.
What is the objective?

303
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,634
Shock and awe.

304
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,636
That was shockingly awful.
What is the objective?

305
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:04,932
Shock and awe.

306
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,406
What is the objective?

307
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,008
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Albert?

308
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,919
I don't really agree with that.

309
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:24,515
You don't really agree with what?

310
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,601
I think if you want to invest $500,000
in your friend's business...

311
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:36,193
that's exactly what you should do.

312
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:39,136
You don't need us to tell you what to do.

313
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,301
We're a board of advisers,
not your kindergarten teachers.

314
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,641
If you want to be taken seriously
as an adult...

315
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:47,112
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult...

316
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:50,185
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money...

317
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,015
from a boardroom
full of your daddy's golf buddies.

318
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:54,884
- That's quite enough!
- I'm not finished.

319
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:59,221
I'd like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity...

320
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:03,024
that she's had to deal with her whole life,
with half her class.

321
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:09,464
We should be taking advice from you,
Miss Cole. Not the other way around.

322
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:12,335
- Sit down...
- No! You know what? I quit!

323
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,083
Oh, my God.

324
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:36,925
Just breathe. How'd it go?

325
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:40,592
I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss!
I quit my job!

326
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,899
- What?
- You said...

327
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:45,832
- I gotta go back.
- No, I didn't tell you to quit.

328
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,704
Relax. Okay, listen, we're fine.

329
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,277
- Would you let me go?
- Albert, no!

330
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,514
Just relax! Okay?

331
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,417
- Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me.
- No!

332
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,755
Relax.

333
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,026
- It's Allegra Cole.
- Answer it.

334
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:16,696
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Answer the door, Albert.

335
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:22,405
Yes. Hi.

336
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,577
What's up?

337
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,813
Listen, Albert, right?

338
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:32,586
- People don't usually talk to me like that.
- Close your mouth, man.

339
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,282
Let me rephrase that.

340
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:38,257
People never talk to me like that.

341
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,055
Stand up.

342
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,927
I guess it's kind of scary for them.

343
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:48,634
But that's why I really appreciate
what you did in there.

344
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:51,938
But I was wondering...

345
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,272
do you think that you and I could
get together sometime this week?

346
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:01,009
You know, to go over things.

347
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:03,747
Financial things.

348
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:07,982
I'd like to see the areas
where I can afford to take some risks.

349
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:10,455
- Check your schedule.
- I'll check my schedule.

350
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,995
Great. Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

351
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,322
I don't think I have one.

352
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,999
- Yes, I do.
- Great.

353
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:37,014
And call me Allegra.

354
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:42,319
- You're done.
- Goodbye.

355
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:47,358
Good job.

356
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,290
Oh, damn.

357
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:17,157
She's some kind of newspaper columnist.
Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper.

358
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,317
What's her drink?

359
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:21,726
Usually beer.
Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty.

360
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,064
Hi.

361
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,705
I noticed your glass was getting low...

362
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,712
so I took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini.

363
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,837
Thank you.

364
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:44,976
And I couldn't help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend.

365
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:48,045
- What's your name?
- They call me Chip.

366
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,351
You can't get them to stop?

367
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,720
That was funny.

368
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,353
Listen, I understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room...

369
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,990
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air.

370
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:02,901
- So don't take the following personally.
- You have fantastic eyes.

371
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,240
Thanks. Try to listen.

372
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:10,333
This is no reflection on you.
I'm just not interested.

373
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,113
But thank you for the compliment
of coming over.

374
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:16,115
You're welcome.
So do you like Cuban food?

375
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,787
Chip, seriously, that was not code for,
"I wish you'd try harder."

376
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:25,052
Are you always so shut-down and afraid
that the right man might make you...

377
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,253
Feel like a natural woman?

378
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,260
Sorry I'm late, honey.
I couldn't get a cab. How was the meeting?

379
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,062
Well, there was a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

380
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:37,472
Nice to meet you, Chip.

381
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:44,108
You, too.

382
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,810
On the one hand,
it is very difficult for a man...

383
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:52,647
to even speak to someone
who looks like you.

384
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:55,984
But on the other hand,
should that be your problem?

385
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,615
So life's kind of hard all around.

386
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,593
Not if you pay attention.

387
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,399
You're sending all the right signals:

388
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,958
no earrings, heels under two inches,
your hair is pulled back...

389
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,733
wearing reading glasses with no book,
drinking a Grey Goose martini...

390
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,106
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn't do it.

391
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,576
If that wasn't clear enough...

392
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,809
there's always the "fuck off"
that you have stamped on your forehead.

393
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,250
Who'd believe there's a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesn't know...

394
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:30,450
and genuinely be interested in who she is,
what she does, without his own agenda?

395
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,494
I wouldn't even know
what that would look like.

396
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,653
So what would a guy like that say?

397
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,198
He'd say, "My name is Alex Hitchens
and I'm a consultant."

398
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,165
But she wouldn't be interested in that...

399
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,771
because she'd be counting the seconds
until he left.

400
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:46,363
Thinking he was like every other guy.

401
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:49,705
Which, life experience has taught her,
is a virtual certainty.

402
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:52,642
But then he'd ask her name
and what she did for a living...

403
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:54,942
and she might blow him off.

404
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,947
Or she might say...

405
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,391
I'm Sara Melas.
I run the gossip column at the Standard.

406
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:08,496
And then he'd ask
all these penetrating questions about her...

407
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:11,828
because he was sincerely,
if atypically, interested.

408
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:12,991
No.

409
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:15,802
- No?
- He'd be interested.

410
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:19,366
But he'd see that there was no way...

411
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,307
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real.

412
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:28,542
Well, he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original.

413
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:30,851
Wouldn't help.

414
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:34,080
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Not really.

415
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:37,919
They'd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward.

416
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,857
My guess is they'd do just fine.

417
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:46,024
It's a pleasure to have met you, Sara Melas.

418
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:54,530
Grey Goose martini
from the gentleman who just left.

419
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:01,506
Is that for me?

420
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,445
What?

421
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,965
Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late.

422
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,873
No, not a problem.

423
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,906
Wow, you're the...

424
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:34,576
- Can I get you something to drink, Mr...
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

425
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,548
So, tell me about her.

426
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,715
Have you ever met someone...

427
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:43,620
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you?

428
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,159
Not just because of her looks,
but that X factor.

429
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,720
How'd you meet her?

430
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:53,232
Actually, I was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom.

431
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:55,235
And by that, of course, you mean...

432
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:58,272
you were buying lingerie
for another woman.

433
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:03,270
Yes. You can't help
where you meet somebody.

434
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:06,503
And the lingerie is for a woman
I'm no longer seeing.

435
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,515
But anyway, the girl I met,
the one I was talking about...

436
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:12,347
she's so sweet, funny, Southern.

437
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:15,513
She gives me her number.
Now she won't return my phone calls.

438
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:19,320
I don't know what it is about her.
I just can't get her out of my mind.

439
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,488
You know, food has lost its taste.
Colors, they seem dull.

440
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,362
Things that used to matter...
I don't know, they just no longer do.

441
00:31:27,502 --> 00:31:30,471
I think things aren't gonna snap back
unless I...

442
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:34,103
Unless I bang her.

443
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,676
Excuse me?

444
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,872
You know, bang her. Clear my head.
Get in, get off, get out.

445
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,952
I think you may have misunderstood
what I do exactly.

446
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:51,787
No, I was told you help guys get in there.

447
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,827
Right. But, see, here's the thing.

448
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:57,329
My clients actually like women.

449
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,502
Hit it and quit it is not my thing.

450
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:06,540
Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi.
I need professional help.

451
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,472
Well, that is for damn certain.

452
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:14,473
And I'm glad you can admit it
because generally that's the hardest part.

453
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:20,547
You see what I'm doing?
This is what I'm about.

454
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:23,720
Power suit, power tie, power steering.

455
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,885
People can wince, cry, beg,
but eventually they do what I want.

456
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,891
So that's, like, a metaphor.

457
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:37,336
Well, I'm more of a literal kind of guy.

458
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,236
So when I do this...

459
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:45,542
this is more like me saying
that I will literally break your shit off...

460
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,514
if you ever touch me again. Okay, pumpkin?

461
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:49,844
Got it.

462
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,860
No.

463
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:04,227
Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant.
Somebody has to eat there.

464
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:07,267
No, somebody famous. You know that.

465
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,196
- Sara Melas?
- No.

466
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:11,696
Okay. Bye.

467
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:15,606
I need your signature.

468
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:34,488
I hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number.

469
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:37,063
So this is me not calling. Over.

470
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:40,134
Yes, you're right.
This is much less invasive.

471
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,135
I've been thinking about
that sign on your forehead.

472
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,264
And I was wondering if you'd mind
taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over.

473
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:51,008
I can't. I have a couple of parties
I have to hit.

474
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,340
Gossip never sleeps.

475
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:55,839
Not till about 4:00 a.m.

476
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,648
Saturday.

477
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,145
I have a date.

478
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,592
Do you know the definition
of "perseverance," Miss Melas?

479
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,787
An excuse to be obnoxious?

480
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,954
Continuing in a course of action...

481
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:15,331
without regard to discouragement,
opposition or previous failure. Over.

482
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,796
Okay, Webster, how do I get rid of you?

483
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:20,875
Breakfast, Sunday.
And you can barely even call that a date.

484
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:24,877
You do that with out-of-town relatives
that you don't even like. Over.

485
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,145
Come on.

486
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,020
Okay, I guess I could do Sunday.

487
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,956
You forgot to say "over." Over.

488
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:41,486
This conversation's over
as soon as you tell me when and where.

489
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:44,565
7:00 a.m., North Cove Marina. Over and out.

490
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:48,901
7:00 a.m.? Are you crazy?
I don't do 7:00 a.m.

491
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:52,237
- Hello?
- Sign here.

492
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,301
- What?
- You said Sunday, right?

493
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:55,535
Yeah.

494
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,981
What if I would have said Friday?

495
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,310
Sunday.

496
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,251
So I guess you're not going to church.

497
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,766
Do you really expect me to wear this?

498
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,832
lt'll be awful cold out there without it.

499
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:32,071
- Good morning.
- "Good" would have been at 10:00.

500
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:38,782
You're a lot taller than I remember.

501
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,854
You ever ride one of these?

502
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:42,616
Not on the Hudson.

503
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:45,749
So, what do you wanna do?
Race me around the Statue of Liberty?

504
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,520
If there's time.

505
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:50,590
- But you might need these.
- All right.

506
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,097
- Bam.
- Wow.

507
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:54,791
How do I look?

508
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,367
Fabulous.

509
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,902
All right, I give.

510
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,370
Where do I change?

511
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:08,941
So we'll go past the wall, then take a left.
It's pretty much a straight shot from there.

512
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,314
- Straight shot to where?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.

513
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:14,114
What you do with these babies is...

514
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,452
Yeah, what I do with this baby
is kick your ass.

515
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:32,030
- What happened? You change your mind?
- It just died.

516
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:34,828
Did you put gas in it?

517
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:39,362
No. You know, I think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something.

518
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:41,942
Gross. Try it again.

519
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:47,339
You want me to call AAA?

520
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,939
Come on around
and let me hop on with you.

521
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:53,781
I don't know. What if you break mine, too?
Then we'll both be sitting ducks.

522
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:57,584
- I didn't break it. It just died.
- Yeah, yeah.

523
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,716
All right, hop on.

524
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,093
- Scoot back.
- Hitch, I'm already here.

525
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:06,428
But you don't know where we're going.

526
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:09,263
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

527
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:13,700
Man, male egos.

528
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:16,641
I don't know how you guys
make it through the day with them.

529
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,871
What? It is not my ego.

530
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,744
I just don't want to ruin the surprise.

531
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,590
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

532
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:39,632
There. I always keep a few of those around.

533
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:40,791
Thank you.

534
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:44,894
I have lower back trouble.
I just shove the ice packs right down there.

535
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,339
No. That's a fresh one.

536
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,905
So, Ellis Island.

537
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:55,309
I have to admit, I have lived in New York
my whole life and I've never been here.

538
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,973
I figured that. Most people haven't.

539
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:59,678
So I got my man Larry here
to set us up a private tour.

540
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:01,812
- Great!
- Anything for Hitch.

541
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:06,688
It was originally known as Oyster Island.

542
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:09,490
The island was expanded
to its present size...

543
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,760
with dirt removed during the construction
of the New York subway system.

544
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:16,094
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

545
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:19,435
- Did you know this?
- Yeah. That's why I brought you here.

546
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,341
In fact, over 100 million Americans
can trace their ancestry...

547
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:28,505
back to a single man, woman, or child
on the ship's manifest...

548
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,674
to an inspector's ledger.

549
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:36,212
By 1910, 75%% of the residents of New York...

550
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:39,656
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston...

551
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,558
were immigrants,
or the children of immigrants.

552
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:46,224
They generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities...

553
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,463
in Little Italys, Chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves.

554
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:53,067
It's called The Kissing Post.

555
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:57,977
The plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences.

556
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,179
Now, what exactly would qualify
as a long absence?

557
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,082
I mean...

558
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,386
- That count?
- No.

559
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:15,224
I actually had a relative come through here.

560
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:17,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:20,659
What?

562
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:24,732
- What?
- What was that thing?

563
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,376
No. You know, I was just thinking...

564
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,678
you can't really know where you're going
until you know where you've been.

565
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,682
- Ain't that right, Larry?
- Amen, brother.

566
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:40,411
That's kind of deep for a first date,
don't you think?

567
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:45,358
What is that?

568
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,708
Oh, my God!

569
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:16,952
That's my great-great-grandfather.
That's his signature.

570
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,082
Jesus, it's right here!

571
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:24,155
How did you know?

572
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:28,125
Hitch did the search. I just found the page.

573
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:53,157
I'm sorry.

574
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,701
I saw that going differently in my mind.

575
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:12,602
So my family never saw him again.
Well, except for on the Wanted posters.

576
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,346
Look, I'm really sorry.

577
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,809
When I saw it on the computer,
it said, "the Butcher of Cádiz."

578
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:26,289
I thought it was a profession,
not a headline.

579
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:32,359
It's just one of those horrible family legacies
we've all tried to forget.

580
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,532
But thank you.

581
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:35,999
No, it was...

582
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,196
- A train wreck.
- No.

583
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:39,806
Let me get you a cab.

584
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:45,874
Thanks.

585
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:50,082
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

586
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,020
Taxi!

587
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:07,292
Poor guy.
Sounds like he went to a lot of trouble.

588
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:12,236
It was fun. In a disastrous kind of way.
I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey.

589
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:16,502
At least you got a good story
out of it, right?

590
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:20,004
Right?

591
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:23,675
- You should try mine, it's great.
- Wait. You're seeing him again?

592
00:43:25,252 --> 00:43:29,018
Well, look, you said that
I'm always expecting men...

593
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:32,183
to let me down, right?
Assuming that they're gonna fail?

594
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,760
Which he did.

595
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:37,587
Yeah, but he did it with flair.

596
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:42,632
I mean, Case, he really tanked.

597
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:44,966
And that's a desirable trait?

598
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:48,537
Yeah. Weird, huh?

599
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:53,672
Now, just keep it simple.
Just like we practiced.

600
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:55,304
We're just leaving a message.

601
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,647
Women like Allegra Cole
don't pick up numbers they don't recognize.

602
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:03,349
Hello?

603
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,720
She's on the phone!

604
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,297
- Yes. Hello, Miss Cole?
- Yeah.

605
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,490
Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you.

606
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,068
- One moment, please.
- No. Tell her I'm at lunch.

607
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:18,104
We called her to tell her you're at lunch?

608
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,804
Allegra. Hi, it's Albert Brennaman.

609
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:29,575
Hi, how are you?

610
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:32,013
Good. I'm doing good.

611
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,479
The reason I'm calling
is about our appointment this Wednesday.

612
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:37,954
Not gonna be able to make it.

613
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,152
Well, when can you make it?

614
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:43,228
When can I do it?

615
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,999
I don't even know,
because my whole next week is slammed.

616
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:53,400
Right. But it's all good.

617
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:58,437
No, we're gonna make it happen though,
that's for sure.

618
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,944
We're going to make it happen. Yes.

619
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:11,190
What's going on over there?

620
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,692
Just moving some things around.

621
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,060
Sky Studios.

622
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:20,565
Tonight I'm actually going
to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.

623
00:45:20,668 --> 00:45:21,930
Designer friend.

624
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:26,130
I just thought it might be something
your designer friend would be interested in.

625
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:27,604
Yeah, definitely.

626
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:31,472
Well, great.
Then I will put you back on with my...

627
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:52,395
- Allegra, over here, please.
- Miss Cole, this way.

628
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,830
Great. One more.

629
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:57,062
- Hi, there.
- This was a fantastic idea.

630
00:45:57,371 --> 00:45:59,737
I suppose. Hey, where's Maggie?

631
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:01,798
Late as usual.

632
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:07,744
Tonight I want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg.

633
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:09,946
Do you know why I want you to do that?

634
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:11,912
Because I'm cool?

635
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,850
- No.
- I know, I'm not.

636
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:16,487
I'm saying that you are an iceberg...

637
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:20,617
in that over 90%% of your mass
is below the surface.

638
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:23,421
I know I'm heavy. I am.

639
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,966
I'm talking about who you are.
It's a metaphor.

640
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,432
Accounting, business...

641
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:33,131
all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper, richer Albert.

642
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,672
One more.

643
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,341
It's gonna be loud in there...

644
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:41,107
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier...

645
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,477
in a non-sleazy way.

646
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,609
So get to where it's loudest.
Ask her if she'd like a drink.

647
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,153
Lean in, place your hand
on the small of her back...

648
00:46:48,255 --> 00:46:50,052
and say it in her ear like a secret.

649
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,591
Watch your hand placement.
Too high says, "I just wanna be friends."

650
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:56,060
Too low says, "I just wanna grab some ass."

651
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:59,792
Friends. Ass. Me.

652
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,563
Special issues: Allegra Cole is a celebrity...

653
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:11,166
which means that when people talk to her,
they'll ignore you completely.

654
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,041
She's classy, so she'll introduce you.

655
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,707
When she does, shake hands hard
and speak up. Let them know you're there.

656
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,682
Show her you can handle being her escort.

657
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:21,983
- Egon, this is Albert.
- How you doing?

658
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:24,419
- Albert, this is Zak.
- Nice to see you.

659
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:26,723
These guys are friends with Maggie.

660
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,020
- Been to that new Brazilian restaurant?
- No, but I am...

661
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,724
It's disgusting.
I'm writing an article about it.

662
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:36,028
Did you see the new installation at MOMA?

663
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,000
- Yes, did you think...
- Disgusting.

664
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,838
Women can always tell
when you're not being real with them.

665
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:47,636
Worst thing you can do is try to fake it,
because you are a great guy.

666
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,348
And you do have something
to offer Allegra that no other man does.

667
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,719
What was your name? Eggnog?

668
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:56,682
Egon.

669
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:01,127
What do you think of the design of the Jets'
new football stadium on the West Side?

670
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,960
Let me guess. Disgusting?

671
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,765
Think it over. We'll be back.

672
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:12,297
Thank you. I can't stand those guys.

673
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:14,634
Really? I kind of liked them.

674
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:16,572
But when all is said and done...

675
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:19,371
tonight is not about Allegra.

676
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,876
- It's not?
- No. Tonight is about Maggie.

677
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,209
A woman's best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions.

678
00:48:27,388 --> 00:48:29,083
So you can't afford to mess this up.

679
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,657
Albert, I want you to meet
my friend, Maggie.

680
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:35,025
Hi, Maggie.
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

681
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,527
I'm Maggie.

682
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:40,592
- No, you're not.
- Actually, I am.

683
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:44,504
Magnus Forester.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

684
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:48,901
- You have very soft hands.
- Thank you.

685
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,611
- Wow. So do you.
- Thank you.

686
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:57,650
So tonight, you focus on one thing
and one thing only.

687
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:58,916
Maggie.

688
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:02,613
- Where does your inspiration come from?
- Oh, my God.

689
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,014
Anything I see.

690
00:49:05,492 --> 00:49:09,189
Something in a magazine,
out on the street...

691
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,888
in an old movie.

692
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:15,494
The receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me.

693
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:17,894
Anybody want any spring rolls?

694
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,337
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.
This whole thing, it just works.

695
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:23,040
Thank you.

696
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,475
- Is he gay?
- I don't think so.

697
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:30,138
I like him.

698
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:34,983
About the deejay.
Generally, I have a firm no-dancing policy.

699
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:37,989
But if she asks, you cannot say no.

700
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,958
I'm not worried about dancing.
But if there are people there...

701
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,521
I'm sorry, I hate to be a stickler,
but I need to be thorough.

702
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:49,292
Show me what you mean
by you're not worried about it.

703
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,633
Trust me. You know what I'm gonna do.

704
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,834
That's what it's all about, right there.

705
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,875
See how it gets bigger?

706
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:03,673
Now I'm gonna start the fire.

707
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:07,817
But the feet are going.
I start the fire, I make the pizza.

708
00:50:08,121 --> 00:50:09,383
Hips are always going.

709
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,353
Can't get enough hip.

710
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:15,061
From there, the Q-Tip.

711
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:19,462
Q-Tip. Throw it away.

712
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,225
That's not working, hit them with this.

713
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:33,742
Don't ever...

714
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:35,773
do that again.

715
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:38,644
Do you hear me?

716
00:50:39,486 --> 00:50:41,351
- Just expressing myself.
- No.

717
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:46,020
Not like that, you're not, all right?

718
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:50,462
This is where you live.

719
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:52,764
Right here.

720
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:55,858
You live right here, okay? This is home.

721
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:57,527
None of this.

722
00:50:58,171 --> 00:50:59,832
I don't wanna see none of that.

723
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,033
Don't need no pizza. They got food there.

724
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,344
Elbows, 6 inches from the waist,
90-degree angles.

725
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,185
Don't you bite your lip. Stop it.

726
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,868
Women relate dancing to sex, all right?

727
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:41,971
Even a great dancer can lose it
with one of these.

728
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,643
Okay, now that's what I need to be learning.

729
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:58,060
Can't stop it.

730
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:00,597
You cannot stop it.

731
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,196
Next subject.

732
00:52:06,306 --> 00:52:07,295
Get out.

733
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:13,674
Thanks.

734
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:16,207
So, are you a Knicks fan?

735
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:19,946
When they're good.

736
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:28,654
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. Why?

737
00:52:29,963 --> 00:52:32,329
- She was there?
- I left you a bunch of messages.

738
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,460
My phone fell in the Hudson.

739
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:35,966
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

740
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,964
I don't believe this.

741
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:45,010
- I thought he was a bodyguard.
- I'm the only one who will need protection.

742
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,812
- Max is gonna...
- Gonna be really irritated.

743
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:51,940
When I got the train this morning,
I thought it was gonna be a good day.

744
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,387
Who the hell is Albert Brennaman?

745
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,119
- Tell me how this happened.
- What? There were some photographers.

746
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,318
Does this even look like dancing to you?

747
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:03,628
That's just a little bit of me being me.

748
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:08,326
No, that's you being a lot of something
you don't need to ever be again.

749
00:53:08,669 --> 00:53:10,193
- It's just one dance.
- No.

750
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:15,365
One dance, one look, one kiss.
That's all we get, Albert.

751
00:53:15,575 --> 00:53:18,237
Just one shot to make the difference...

752
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:20,836
between happily ever after and:

753
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:24,710
"Oh, he's just some guy
I went to some thing with once."

754
00:53:25,686 --> 00:53:26,675
All right?

755
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:35,089
- What?
- You said "kiss."

756
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,288
Is that a problem?

757
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,828
It's not a problem, but this is Allegra Cole.

758
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:45,268
Eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss...

759
00:53:45,372 --> 00:53:48,398
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship.

760
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,944
And believe me,
she has definitely thought about it.

761
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:54,744
- She has?
- Of course.

762
00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:58,477
Not that she's gonna act on it.
So it's no real big deal.

763
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,711
- All right, it's no big deal then.
- It's a very big deal!

764
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,289
- Huge.
- Monumental!

765
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,358
You are not listening...

766
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,954
I need you to wrap your head around this.

767
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:11,860
Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole...

768
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,862
could have her last first kiss.

769
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,145
All right, come on,
just show me what you got.

770
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:32,645
- What do you mean?
- Just show me how you would kiss me.

771
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,580
I wouldn't kiss you.

772
00:54:35,055 --> 00:54:36,488
I'm not me, I'm Allegra.

773
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,986
But you're really not, so...

774
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:44,962
Okay, Albert, end of the night,
you're dropping me off at home.

775
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,792
- Show me the magic.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

776
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:51,496
God, Albert,
I had such a wonderful time with you.

777
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:53,300
Yeah, how about those Knicks?

778
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:58,836
You see what I'm doing?
This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys.

779
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:00,537
A woman that doesn't want a kiss...

780
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,513
takes her keys out, puts them in the door,
goes in the house.

781
00:55:03,617 --> 00:55:05,710
A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles.

782
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,418
I'm fiddling.

783
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,386
Okay, you have a good night now...

784
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,955
- You see what I'm doing?
- Robbing me?

785
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,118
No.

786
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:18,226
This is what most guys do.
They rush in to take the kiss.

787
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,123
But you're not most guys.

788
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:25,030
See, the secret to a kiss
is to go 90%% of the way...

789
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:27,367
and then hold.

790
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:34,540
- For how long?
- As long as it takes...

791
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:36,946
for her to come the other 10%% .

792
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,948
Okay, 90%% -10%% . Got it.

793
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,384
Okay, come on. Shake it off. It's your turn.

794
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:48,491
I had a really nice time tonight, Albert.

795
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,328
I had a great time tonight, too, Allegra...

796
00:55:56,303 --> 00:55:57,770
with a beard.

797
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:32,238
What's up?

798
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,972
- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you mean? I came 90%% .

799
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,134
I'm not feeling like you want it.

800
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:42,739
Look, I'm Allegra Cole,
the woman of your dreams.

801
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:46,615
The woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire.

802
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,018
Now, show me the magic, Albert.

803
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,889
- What the hell was that?
- I'm showing you the magic!

804
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:54,118
No, I said come 90%% and then I come 10%%!

805
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:55,785
You don't go the whole 100%%!

806
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:59,388
My mouth was open, Albert.
You overeager son of a...

807
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:04,403
Other than that, how was it?

808
00:57:05,438 --> 00:57:08,601
They came together, they danced together,
and they left together.

809
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:11,577
He's cute, in a sheepdog kind of way.

810
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:13,736
For all I know, he's adorable.

811
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,310
But him dating her is...

812
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:18,007
You seem stressed.

813
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:19,880
You and I had an understanding.

814
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:22,477
If you invite Allegra,
you're supposed to call me.

815
00:57:22,656 --> 00:57:24,146
I didn't invite her.

816
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,917
Honestly, sweetie,
I thought she was still in Europe.

817
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,325
- So you invited Albert?
- No.

818
00:57:29,963 --> 00:57:34,024
Look, it says here the tickets
went to some guy named Alex Hitchens.

819
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:35,158
What?

820
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:47,908
Machine.

821
00:57:51,284 --> 00:57:52,911
Hi, it's Sara.

822
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:59,123
I just wanted to say thank you...

823
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:03,958
for an unforgettable experience...

824
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:05,423
the other day.

825
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:09,333
And if you ever want to see
your shirt again...

826
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:13,395
you can come by
the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8:00.

827
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:15,741
Okay, bye.

828
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:21,644
- Do you think he'll show?
- Yeah.

829
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:24,815
He's too much of a player
to have a bad date on his record.

830
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:27,985
Is this a source or a date?

831
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:30,486
A source.

832
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:33,152
Well, it sounded like a date.

833
00:58:34,194 --> 00:58:35,661
Well, it was supposed to.

834
00:58:38,832 --> 00:58:42,029
So it looks like a date
and it sounds like a date...

835
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,529
- but it's not a date.
- Yeah. Right.

836
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,900
Just checking.

837
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:10,756
Hi. I wasn't sure you got my message.

838
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:15,526
I wasn't sure you called the right guy.
You must be a glutton for punishment.

839
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:18,630
Either that or I really wanna pay you back.

840
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:20,904
I think this is yours.

841
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:25,208
Thank you.
I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame.

842
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:27,737
Really? There's a whole wall?

843
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:29,641
So what are we getting into?

844
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,052
Ever been to a food rave before?

845
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,090
Happens once a month, all around the city.
Different chefs, different venues.

846
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,519
You any good in the kitchen?

847
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,889
I can stand the heat,
if that's what you mean.

848
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:45,795
Good. Because that's my boss
and his wife right over there.

849
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:47,499
Interesting.

850
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:51,669
Well, here's a concept:
We're paying to cook our own food.

851
00:59:51,805 --> 00:59:54,933
Here's another concept:
Shut up. It's an evening out.

852
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:57,271
The longer you're married,
the less you go out.

853
00:59:57,377 --> 01:00:01,643
In a couple of years, we're gonna end up
bricked into our apartment like a Poe story.

854
01:00:02,649 --> 01:00:05,379
So, Louise, are you
in the newspaper business, also?

855
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,849
No, I'm a psychiatrist.

856
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:11,620
Well, that's the last thing
I'm gonna say tonight.

857
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:15,952
So, Sara, you never told me.

858
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:20,063
How was the Sky Studio fashion thing
you went to the other night?

859
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,499
Did you meet anyone worth mentioning?

860
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:24,961
No.

861
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:30,370
Really? I find that very odd.

862
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,208
- Max.
- I think you're being odd.

863
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:36,804
Well, I'm always odd.
It's why you married me.

864
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,077
And it's why I married you.

865
01:00:40,286 --> 01:00:41,810
Speaking of which, Hitch...

866
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:45,755
what exactly are your intentions
for the lovely Sara?

867
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,157
Wait, you know what?
Actually, there was someone.

868
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:54,361
I think I met your friends Albert and Allegra.

869
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:57,897
- My friends who and who?
- Allegra Cole?

870
01:00:58,037 --> 01:01:00,232
Really? How do you know her?

871
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:03,905
- I don't.
- So you know Albert?

872
01:01:05,445 --> 01:01:07,504
- Knew.
- He had your tickets.

873
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:11,050
I mean, how well do you really
know your accountant?

874
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:16,120
April 15, and then you don't see him again
till April 15.

875
01:01:17,624 --> 01:01:18,921
Ladies and gentlemen...

876
01:01:19,025 --> 01:01:22,222
a coquille St. Jacques
with a lemon butter reduction.

877
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,555
- Compliments of our chef.
- Thank you.

878
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:26,723
I'm sure you're really gonna enjoy this.

879
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,005
That's really good.

880
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:39,170
I'm very impressed.

881
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,404
Why is that?

882
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:47,147
Around these two, people usually can't wait
to name-drop and dish their friends...

883
01:01:47,253 --> 01:01:48,777
and you're being all discreet.

884
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:51,015
Yeah, it's quite endearing.

885
01:01:51,157 --> 01:01:53,955
Actually, it is.
So why don't we change the subject?

886
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:59,422
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

887
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:04,169
So Sara tells me
that you're a consultant, Hitch.

888
01:02:04,737 --> 01:02:09,504
Yeah, mostly marketing, little advertising,
brand management.

889
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:12,841
I have no idea what that means.

890
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:15,810
No one does.
That's why I get to charge so much.

891
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,817
Are you sure you're all right?

892
01:02:22,522 --> 01:02:26,652
Yeah, I'm fine.
Is it itchy in here or is it just me?

893
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,386
- I know what's happening.
- No.

894
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,730
You think that I'm in a stressful state...

895
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:35,026
because I'm trying to make
a good impression...

896
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,331
while also dealing
with my commitment issues...

897
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,607
trying to avoid
all these awkward conversations.

898
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:45,837
No, I think you have food allergies.

899
01:02:49,215 --> 01:02:50,682
- Wow.
- What?

900
01:02:53,253 --> 01:02:55,380
- Benadryl. Where's the Benadryl?
- Aisle 2.

901
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,183
- Which one's Aisle 2?
- The one with the big 2 over it.

902
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,849
Sara, I'm fine.

903
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,120
- You sure it's in Aisle 2?
- No.

904
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:04,320
Really, it is not that serious.

905
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:09,698
Benadryl.

906
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:13,968
- A lot of Benadryl. A lot.
- What? Are you...

907
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:31,218
Coquille St. Jacques. Death on a leaf!

908
01:03:35,662 --> 01:03:36,754
Come on!

909
01:03:48,007 --> 01:03:49,804
Okay, we're doing fine.

910
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,377
Just a couple more blocks
and you get to lie down.

911
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:03,186
Wait, who sings that song again?

912
01:04:03,323 --> 01:04:05,154
Oh, girl. Earth, Wind & Fire.

913
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,122
You should let them sing it.

914
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:14,561
I bet this would be great on the rocks.
It's good, right?

915
01:04:17,003 --> 01:04:19,972
I bet I can ask you
just about anything right now.

916
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:21,263
No.

917
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:23,900
I'm a vault, baby. Locked down.

918
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:29,179
What is an heiress doing with a CPA?

919
01:04:29,682 --> 01:04:31,411
They're going to the Knicks game.

920
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:34,053
Yep, Fort Knox.

921
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:38,482
He loves her so much!

922
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:40,582
I'm sure he does.

923
01:04:41,194 --> 01:04:45,528
I'm telling you, people search
their whole lives trying to find the...

924
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:48,566
Reasons that we're here

925
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:50,998
I wouldn't know.

926
01:04:52,004 --> 01:04:53,437
You would if you saw it.

927
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,401
Sometimes it's really hard
to see the forest through the sleaze.

928
01:04:58,678 --> 01:05:00,976
What about you? You ever been in love?

929
01:05:06,252 --> 01:05:07,378
Yep.

930
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,420
But you're never gonna know that.

931
01:05:17,196 --> 01:05:20,188
Okay, I think you've had enough
of the juice box.

932
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:24,233
Let's go.

933
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,939
This is some place.

934
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,577
You live here alone?

935
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:42,013
Yeah. I actually prefer it that way.
What about you?

936
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,955
I haven't had a roommate since college,
and he upped and married my sister.

937
01:05:47,093 --> 01:05:49,755
- Really?
- Yeah, they're gonna have a baby soon.

938
01:05:50,296 --> 01:05:51,763
Uncle Hitch.

939
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:54,764
Thank you.

940
01:06:00,807 --> 01:06:03,742
- So, how do you feel?
- Good.

941
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:06,373
Relaxed.

942
01:06:07,914 --> 01:06:09,575
So what about you? Any siblings?

943
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:15,786
Sister. Maria. Lives in D.C.

944
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,614
Younger, right?

945
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:23,953
I could hear it in your voice.

946
01:06:25,531 --> 01:06:28,989
Sort of an innate protective thing.

947
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:32,927
Yeah, I guess.

948
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:39,800
What?

949
01:06:43,149 --> 01:06:44,480
She almost died once.

950
01:06:49,622 --> 01:06:50,782
I was 10.

951
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:02,463
We were skating on the pond
behind our house...

952
01:07:02,902 --> 01:07:04,494
and she fell through the ice.

953
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,438
My dad pulled her out.

954
01:07:12,712 --> 01:07:14,236
Gave her mouth-to-mouth.

955
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:20,452
Longest three minutes of my life.

956
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:23,845
Yeah, I'm sure.

957
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,621
I don't think I've ever really gotten over it.

958
01:07:36,402 --> 01:07:39,633
Kind of defines you, doesn't it?

959
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:49,239
You know like,
one moment you're gliding along...

960
01:07:50,616 --> 01:07:54,552
the next moment you're standing in the rain
watching your life fall apart.

961
01:07:56,622 --> 01:07:57,953
Except it was snow.

962
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:02,686
Yeah. That's what I said, "snow."

963
01:08:05,031 --> 01:08:06,123
You said "rain."

964
01:08:08,301 --> 01:08:10,667
Some kind of precipitation.

965
01:08:15,474 --> 01:08:17,032
Is that what happened to you?

966
01:08:21,547 --> 01:08:24,880
Nothing as dramatic
as falling through the ice.

967
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:30,616
You know...

968
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:33,515
it definitely...

969
01:08:37,296 --> 01:08:38,729
Left a scar?

970
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,126
Yeah.

971
01:08:54,814 --> 01:08:58,306
I guess it's best just not to love at all, right?

972
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:03,952
Or skate.

973
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:33,518
Are you here?

974
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:47,658
Sara, you're such an idiot! You moron!
What the hell did you think?

975
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:50,861
You're so stupid! You gotta learn, Sara.

976
01:09:51,003 --> 01:09:53,631
- When are you gonna learn...
- Should I come back later?

977
01:09:55,841 --> 01:09:59,299
Hi. I thought you left.

978
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:04,141
Well, I did,
but then I came back with breakfast.

979
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:08,247
I figured it was the least that I could do.

980
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:12,413
I didn't know what you were drinking...

981
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:17,525
so I got a grande cap, a latte,
an Earl Grey tea...

982
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,958
and something with "chai" in the title.

983
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,161
Tea for me.

984
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:25,999
Tea. Yes! I was hoping you'd say that.

985
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,239
Oh, God.
You're a morning person, aren't you?

986
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:36,677
Well, like I always tell my clients:

987
01:10:36,782 --> 01:10:39,774
Begin each day as if it were on purpose.

988
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,586
- Wow. Beautiful day.
- Yeah.

989
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:53,731
- Beautiful girl.
- Thank you.

990
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:57,534
Well, I'm this way.

991
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,369
I'm that way.

992
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,869
Give me a ring sometime.

993
01:11:05,778 --> 01:11:07,575
I mean, on the phone.

994
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:12,810
No, I definitely will.

995
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:16,580
Good.

996
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,682
I gotta go to work.

997
01:11:57,463 --> 01:11:58,589
Bye.

998
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:02,429
Goodbye.

999
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:30,389
Can you believe what a beautiful day it is...

1000
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:32,292
not?

1001
01:12:32,398 --> 01:12:35,526
- What's wrong, pumpkin?
- I'm so stupid.

1002
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:38,466
I ignored your advice. I went on that date.

1003
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:39,595
With who?

1004
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:42,165
Not the lingerie guy.

1005
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:45,641
Vance Munson. And you're right,
there's no way he ever had a mother.

1006
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,075
That bad?

1007
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:51,577
He took me to Scalinatella,
and he was affectionate and sweet.

1008
01:12:52,084 --> 01:12:55,485
He told me all these intimate things,
like how he can't taste food...

1009
01:12:55,588 --> 01:12:57,078
and he wants three kids.

1010
01:12:57,223 --> 01:12:58,485
So you slept with him.

1011
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,783
I never seen anybody get dressed that fast.

1012
01:13:01,894 --> 01:13:03,657
Case, I'm so sorry.

1013
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:08,898
- Maybe I'll just die alone after all.
- No, you won't.

1014
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:13,403
You'll meet a great guy with a great smile
and you'll travel the world together.

1015
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:15,666
Who are you? Where's my best friend?

1016
01:13:15,774 --> 01:13:19,005
It's true. He just hasn't found you yet.
But he will.

1017
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:22,842
Just as he's leaving, guess what he says:
"Date Doctor, my ass."

1018
01:13:22,948 --> 01:13:25,849
- What does that mean?
- It means he's really out there.

1019
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:29,819
And if I ever meet him, the only date
he's gonna need is with a real doctor.

1020
01:13:42,468 --> 01:13:43,560
That's him.

1021
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,096
Vance, is that you?

1022
01:13:46,805 --> 01:13:49,740
Yeah, hey there, beautiful.

1023
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,309
Sara Melas, from the Standard.

1024
01:13:51,443 --> 01:13:53,911
I'd like to discuss
the dating consultant you hired...

1025
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,174
before you went out with Casey Sedgewick.

1026
01:13:59,718 --> 01:14:03,119
You don't wanna talk, that's fine.
I'm going to write this anyway.

1027
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:06,020
You just earned yourself a photo
with a boldface caption.

1028
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:07,591
What? Nice.

1029
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,459
I can only imagine how the trading
floor guys will react when they see this.

1030
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:13,292
You have no proof, no facts.

1031
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:16,129
Vance, I'm a gossip columnist, not the DA.

1032
01:14:16,235 --> 01:14:18,999
Okay, how much will it cost me
to stay out of this?

1033
01:14:19,138 --> 01:14:20,935
I don't want money. I want a name.

1034
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,372
- I don't know his name.
- Well, what do you know?

1035
01:14:26,312 --> 01:14:27,711
I know this.

1036
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:36,145
All this for a lousy lay.

1037
01:14:36,655 --> 01:14:37,952
Are we satisfied?

1038
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:40,886
Almost.

1039
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,631
No, you... You got to be...

1040
01:14:53,505 --> 01:14:54,904
Is this really necessary?

1041
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:57,008
Have you seen your back?

1042
01:14:57,109 --> 01:15:00,909
No, but I see my front and maybe
we should be starting with some sit-ups.

1043
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:03,341
God! Mother of Troy!

1044
01:15:06,885 --> 01:15:08,079
Hello?

1045
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:13,355
That's crazy.
Just hearing your voice makes me smile.

1046
01:15:13,459 --> 01:15:14,756
How are you?

1047
01:15:14,893 --> 01:15:17,054
I'm good, I think.

1048
01:15:17,296 --> 01:15:20,823
No, actually, you know what?
I feel a little strange.

1049
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:24,332
I'm good.

1050
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:27,103
Sweet Georgia Brown!

1051
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:28,365
What was that?

1052
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:31,534
No, that's just some guy screaming.

1053
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:34,542
Listen, is there any context...

1054
01:15:34,646 --> 01:15:39,743
under which you'd consider facial edema
and pharmaceutical intervention a date?

1055
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:42,519
Probably not.

1056
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,883
How about a do-over?

1057
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:46,924
- What do you have in mind?
- Dinner, my place.

1058
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:50,754
Because obviously going anywhere public
with you is out of the question.

1059
01:15:51,697 --> 01:15:54,461
God! That's it. I don't like you very much.

1060
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:55,931
What is that?

1061
01:15:56,068 --> 01:15:57,262
Wait, I'm getting up.

1062
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,036
It's like one of those makeover shows.

1063
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,232
- That's a makeover show?
- It's Danish.

1064
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:04,036
Almost done!

1065
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:06,271
Friday?

1066
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:11,245
Can't. I told a friend I'd go speed dating.
You know, for moral support.

1067
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:13,075
But tomorrow I'm free.

1068
01:16:14,453 --> 01:16:16,387
Great. All right, 8:00?

1069
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,644
Great.

1070
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:20,588
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1071
01:16:25,931 --> 01:16:29,128
- See, it wasn't so bad, was it?
- God!

1072
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:36,099
Ball is back in play
after a 20-second timeout.

1073
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:40,338
Knicks lead the Grizzlies, 12-6,
here early in the first quarter.

1074
01:16:50,155 --> 01:16:52,715
- So this is what this feels like?
- "This" being?

1075
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:55,485
Great seats, great game.

1076
01:16:57,062 --> 01:16:58,927
Great date.

1077
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:02,760
I mean, sort of.

1078
01:17:03,402 --> 01:17:05,734
To me, it feels like a...

1079
01:17:06,405 --> 01:17:08,430
- Date?
- Yeah.

1080
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:16,042
Look at her. She looks so happy.

1081
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:19,475
How does a guy like that end up
with a girl like her?

1082
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:28,788
I am so jealous.
I've always wanted to be able to do that.

1083
01:17:29,128 --> 01:17:32,222
Really? Tonight is your lucky night.
Let's see what you got.

1084
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,992
Okay. You ready?

1085
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:40,134
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

1086
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,400
Knicks off to a great start...

1087
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,031
All right, here's how it works.

1088
01:17:44,143 --> 01:17:48,375
Central Park Zoo, tomorrow, noon,
by the sea lions.

1089
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,208
No, don't worry. I'll find you.

1090
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,547
All right. Thank you.

1091
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:14,469
It's all right. I'm sorry.

1092
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,205
Damn me.

1093
01:18:20,646 --> 01:18:23,046
That was it! You got it. Do it again.

1094
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,115
Look how cute they are.

1095
01:18:57,449 --> 01:18:58,643
Thanks.

1096
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:17,160
I had a great time tonight, Albert.

1097
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:21,033
I had a great time, too, Allegra.

1098
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,193
Good night.

1099
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:45,026
Good night, Albert.

1100
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,871
- Allegra.
- Yes?

1101
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,345
Hold on.

1102
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,201
I like your lips.

1103
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:36,008
They seem to like you, too.

1104
01:20:44,489 --> 01:20:45,888
Good night.

1105
01:20:46,558 --> 01:20:47,923
Good night.

1106
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,324
- Anything?
- Not yet.

1107
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,623
But I got some great shots
of you biting your nails.

1108
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:31,400
Well, it's a big story.

1109
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:34,930
- Incoming.
- Really?

1110
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,337
Yep. They're shaking hands.

1111
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,807
This is so great. I can't wait to nail this guy.

1112
01:21:38,944 --> 01:21:40,935
Make sure you get a good shot of his face.

1113
01:21:41,046 --> 01:21:43,446
- What's he look like?
- Tall, dark, and handsome.

1114
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:45,207
Basic principles:

1115
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,716
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter when.

1116
01:21:47,853 --> 01:21:49,548
This is killing me.

1117
01:21:49,688 --> 01:21:51,349
Geoff is managing to play it straight.

1118
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,287
How long have you been in love with her?

1119
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:57,055
Her? About two-and-a-half years.

1120
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:00,891
Take a look.

1121
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:12,170
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert Brennaman.

1122
01:22:12,277 --> 01:22:14,302
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

1123
01:22:16,715 --> 01:22:18,148
What? Sara.

1124
01:22:24,423 --> 01:22:27,654
- Pleasure to meet you, Geoff.
- Hey, what...

1125
01:22:32,264 --> 01:22:35,859
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert Brennaman.

1126
01:22:36,101 --> 01:22:38,262
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

1127
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:42,163
You sure you want to do this?

1128
01:22:42,908 --> 01:22:43,932
Why wouldn't I?

1129
01:22:47,446 --> 01:22:51,906
Louise made an interesting observation
on the way home the other night.

1130
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,509
She said people who are guarded
are afraid...

1131
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,490
that you can see right through them.

1132
01:22:59,624 --> 01:23:03,890
That's why they hide behind
layers of secrecy or humor.

1133
01:23:04,095 --> 01:23:07,462
He'll have to hide behind a lot more
than that once this hits the fan.

1134
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,427
She meant you.

1135
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:16,206
What do you want me to say?

1136
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:21,906
That I like the guy?
Yeah, sure, I liked the guy.

1137
01:23:23,648 --> 01:23:26,082
Well, here's his shirt.

1138
01:23:28,153 --> 01:23:32,112
- Why don't you think about it? Call me.
- Thanks.

1139
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:46,165
Papi, Sara Melas is here to see you.

1140
01:23:47,672 --> 01:23:50,732
Thanks a lot, Raoul. Send her up.
And stop calling me papi.

1141
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:05,820
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

1142
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,286
I believe this belongs to you.

1143
01:24:13,498 --> 01:24:16,126
Yeah, this thing is like a bad penny.

1144
01:24:16,234 --> 01:24:17,360
Wow!

1145
01:24:18,503 --> 01:24:19,993
So this is it.

1146
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:22,366
Yeah, this is it.

1147
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:26,109
Business must be good.

1148
01:24:26,745 --> 01:24:29,339
Well, it has its rewards.

1149
01:24:31,182 --> 01:24:32,513
I'll bet.

1150
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:35,316
Tough day?

1151
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:37,685
You could say that.

1152
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:42,285
Well, you know what?
You can just sit back and relax.

1153
01:24:42,394 --> 01:24:44,225
I got this all covered.

1154
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:49,890
Spanish wine!

1155
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:54,331
How thoughtful are we?

1156
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:57,340
- Here, let me pour that for you.
- No, that's okay.

1157
01:24:57,943 --> 01:25:00,673
- You want some?
- Sure.

1158
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:04,574
So, Hitch.

1159
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,651
Is that a noun or a verb?

1160
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,618
I guess it depends.

1161
01:25:15,226 --> 01:25:19,026
Let's see, what should we toast to?

1162
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,101
Never lie, steal, cheat, or drink.

1163
01:25:26,104 --> 01:25:29,301
But if you must lie,
lie in the arms of the one you love.

1164
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:33,176
If you must steal,
steal away from bad company.

1165
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:36,042
If you must cheat, cheat death.

1166
01:25:36,948 --> 01:25:38,313
And if you must drink...

1167
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:42,114
drink in the moments
that take your breath away.

1168
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,947
Did you just make that up?

1169
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,769
Make yourself at home.

1170
01:26:00,438 --> 01:26:02,770
I'm gonna check on the risotto.

1171
01:26:04,509 --> 01:26:07,740
Look at this! Which one's the music?

1172
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:16,850
It does lights, too?

1173
01:26:19,024 --> 01:26:21,515
Let me help you out with that.

1174
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:24,322
Now, this is nifty.

1175
01:26:25,964 --> 01:26:27,261
What are you doing?

1176
01:26:27,732 --> 01:26:29,825
How does it work, exactly?

1177
01:26:31,469 --> 01:26:36,372
Well, usually you have dinner,
then you have dessert.

1178
01:26:37,242 --> 01:26:40,609
No, I mean your thriving business.

1179
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:46,449
I don't do interviews.

1180
01:26:48,386 --> 01:26:52,117
But if you'd like to get back to the evening,
I'd be happy to sit and talk.

1181
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:54,157
Great idea. You start.

1182
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,988
Well, maybe I would if you weren't snarling.

1183
01:27:06,571 --> 01:27:08,539
What if I told you...

1184
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:13,577
that I know exactly what you do
and how you do it?

1185
01:27:13,712 --> 01:27:15,612
And I think it's despicable!

1186
01:27:15,714 --> 01:27:18,547
You know what?
We might need to go out to dinner.

1187
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:22,244
There's a great seafood restaurant
I'd love to take you to.

1188
01:27:24,289 --> 01:27:26,416
How about you just get a cleaver, butcher?

1189
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:29,927
- Maybe I will!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1190
01:27:30,061 --> 01:27:31,892
Nothing a front-page story can't cure.

1191
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,429
So that's what this is all about?

1192
01:27:33,565 --> 01:27:36,363
Albert and Allegra
on the front of your crap-ass newspaper?

1193
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:38,265
- You put them there!
- No, you did!

1194
01:27:38,403 --> 01:27:41,065
No, he did! The minute he called you!

1195
01:28:08,633 --> 01:28:10,692
Dr. Hitch. Listen to me, papi.

1196
01:28:10,802 --> 01:28:14,795
I need to bring my partner, Amir,
somewhere amazing for our anniversary.

1197
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:18,374
Maybe it's not your thing, but maybe it is.

1198
01:28:18,476 --> 01:28:20,444
What the hell are you talking about, Raoul?

1199
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:22,068
It's you, no?

1200
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,559
So, my friend, how was she? Pretty good?

1201
01:28:50,675 --> 01:28:53,166
How was she? I'll tell you! She was great!

1202
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:08,921
Isn't that the Date Doctor?

1203
01:29:09,027 --> 01:29:12,155
- I'm telling you, that's him.
- He doesn't look anything like him.

1204
01:29:12,297 --> 01:29:14,925
- Excuse me. Do you know him?
- No.

1205
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,995
I want you to look me in the eye
and tell me that he did not hire you.

1206
01:29:19,137 --> 01:29:22,937
Ma'am, I have never seen this man
before in my life.

1207
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:24,099
See you later, Tony.

1208
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:26,803
Tony? You have got
some serious explaining to do.

1209
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:28,879
Albert. Hitch. You all right?

1210
01:29:29,013 --> 01:29:31,811
I can't really talk right now.
I'm kind of tied up.

1211
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:33,884
One, two. On three.

1212
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:43,791
Women will remain seated.

1213
01:29:43,895 --> 01:29:47,058
Men will rotate to the left at the buzzer.

1214
01:29:47,365 --> 01:29:49,390
You get two minutes each,
four minutes total.

1215
01:29:49,534 --> 01:29:53,095
So trade your talk time when you hear...

1216
01:29:55,373 --> 01:29:56,567
the gong.

1217
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:58,608
If it's mutual, you get numbers.

1218
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:02,235
If not, better luck next time, okay?

1219
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:05,582
Ladies, take your seats.

1220
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:11,615
Case, you are a living testimonial
to the triumph of hope over experience.

1221
01:30:11,756 --> 01:30:12,916
Thanks for coming.

1222
01:30:13,057 --> 01:30:16,254
I know it's lame. I'm sure it's the last thing
you feel like doing.

1223
01:30:16,527 --> 01:30:20,486
I really prefer Rachmaninoff
to the heavier romantic composers.

1224
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,725
But despite the pan-Germanic
anti-Semitism...

1225
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:26,929
I'd still have to say my favorite is Wagner.

1226
01:30:29,274 --> 01:30:31,765
- Nice talking to you.
- Thank you. Bye.

1227
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:32,968
Bye.

1228
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,108
Excuse me.

1229
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:38,273
That's my seat, man.

1230
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:42,409
My name is Ron. I'm 28.

1231
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,045
Albert Brennaman is a good man.

1232
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:47,953
In fact, Albert Brennaman is a great man.

1233
01:30:48,092 --> 01:30:50,788
I just got out of a five-year relationship.

1234
01:30:50,929 --> 01:30:53,796
I'm a lot of fun at parties. I like dogs...

1235
01:30:53,932 --> 01:30:56,594
And then you're mad at me
for what I do for a living?

1236
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,066
I've already got your number...

1237
01:30:58,169 --> 01:31:00,763
so why don't you go
consult your conscience?

1238
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,636
- Albert is in love with her.
- Just like Sebastian?

1239
01:31:03,775 --> 01:31:05,675
- Is there a problem?
- No, just one sec.

1240
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:08,574
- What do you have against Allegra anyway?
- Nothing.

1241
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,774
My interest is protecting women
from assholes like you.

1242
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,578
I did ice climbing once.

1243
01:31:13,685 --> 01:31:15,983
- You don't even know me.
- And whose fault is that?

1244
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,918
...the sun comes up,
the ice really starts to fall apart.

1245
01:31:19,023 --> 01:31:20,251
I bet. I'm sorry.

1246
01:31:20,358 --> 01:31:22,451
- Do you know this guy?
- Apparently not.

1247
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,187
You're in my seat.

1248
01:31:24,329 --> 01:31:27,821
You really...
I'm doing you a favor, believe me.

1249
01:31:27,966 --> 01:31:32,096
Basically, I like outdoor sports.
But indoor sports have their place, too.

1250
01:31:32,203 --> 01:31:34,865
There are certain aspects of my job
that are secretive.

1251
01:31:35,006 --> 01:31:37,133
And my job is to try to find the truth.

1252
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:40,870
The truth? You wouldn't know the truth
if it kicked you in the head.

1253
01:31:41,012 --> 01:31:43,606
If Albert Brennaman has to take a fall for it,
so be it.

1254
01:31:43,715 --> 01:31:45,945
Why don't you say
what's really pissing you off?

1255
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:47,540
I've been waiting to talk to her...

1256
01:31:47,685 --> 01:31:50,153
- You want to sit down? Here you go. Gong!
- Thank you.

1257
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:51,312
Excuse me.

1258
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:54,482
Hi. Actually, you're not supposed to move.

1259
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,356
I'm Alex Hitchens. No, it's okay. Go.

1260
01:31:57,495 --> 01:31:59,053
- I'm Casey.
- Hi, Casey.

1261
01:31:59,197 --> 01:32:02,166
I work for a small publishing house
in the press department...

1262
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:05,326
which isn't actually where I want to be.
But it's a good house...

1263
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:07,996
You handled me. You manipulated me.

1264
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:11,735
You researched me and you showed me
my great-grandfather's signature.

1265
01:32:11,876 --> 01:32:14,003
Wait. You're Ellis Island?

1266
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:16,012
- I thought that was real sweet.
- Thank you.

1267
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,775
Case, you're not helping.

1268
01:32:17,882 --> 01:32:19,509
Excuse me, I'm on a date.

1269
01:32:20,852 --> 01:32:24,515
Does it ever occur to women
that maybe a guy might like to have a plan...

1270
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,089
because he's nervous?

1271
01:32:26,224 --> 01:32:30,183
He's not sure that he could just
walk up to you and you'd respond if he said:

1272
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:31,761
"I like you."

1273
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,294
- That sounds good to me.
- True, you can't tell them you like them.

1274
01:32:39,404 --> 01:32:42,601
- I tried that. It didn't go well.
- I've crashed and burned on that.

1275
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:45,402
That is what you did, and I did like you!

1276
01:32:45,543 --> 01:32:48,569
I just didn't know I was being worked over
by some professional.

1277
01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:50,044
He doesn't have a badge.

1278
01:32:50,715 --> 01:32:52,740
The only time he was sincere
or spontaneous...

1279
01:32:52,884 --> 01:32:56,684
was when everything was going wrong
or when you were stoned out of your head.

1280
01:32:56,788 --> 01:33:00,087
- I'm sorry to interrupt. Do I know you?
- No, I don't think so.

1281
01:33:00,224 --> 01:33:03,091
- You wanna see me be spontaneous?
- Sure, you want a Benadryl?

1282
01:33:03,227 --> 01:33:07,789
This is really kind of distracting.
And I haven't gotten laid in a year!

1283
01:33:14,138 --> 01:33:16,971
We're sorry.
Why don't you guys get back to your date?

1284
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,208
Or go somewhere.

1285
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:22,507
Maybe from the bank?

1286
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:26,880
If this doesn't work out, call him.
He might hook you up with Paris Hilton.

1287
01:33:26,984 --> 01:33:30,317
Wait, that's it. You're the Date Doctor, right?

1288
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:37,928
- You're the Date Doctor?
- Do we have a problem here?

1289
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:42,625
Yeah, a big one!
What the hell did I ever do to you?

1290
01:33:44,602 --> 01:33:46,001
Am I missing something?

1291
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:48,563
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1292
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,501
Why don't you go hit a titty bar
with your buddy Vance?

1293
01:33:57,348 --> 01:33:58,440
Wow.

1294
01:34:00,351 --> 01:34:01,545
I don't believe this.

1295
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:06,554
That's your source?

1296
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:08,982
You buried yourself, Alex.

1297
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,321
Then you weren't listening.

1298
01:34:11,462 --> 01:34:13,657
I heard every word.

1299
01:34:14,165 --> 01:34:15,792
You're a scam artist.

1300
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,461
- You trick women into getting...
- Into getting out of their own way...

1301
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:23,006
so great guys like Albert Brennaman
have a fighting chance.

1302
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:26,668
No, I want everybody
to take a good look at this right now.

1303
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:28,278
Because this right here...

1304
01:34:28,379 --> 01:34:32,372
this is exactly why falling in love
is so goddamn hard.

1305
01:34:33,851 --> 01:34:35,785
Sir, let's go. Now.

1306
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:41,257
And Vance Munson is a pig!

1307
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:43,691
And I refused to work with him.

1308
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:46,157
You need to get your facts right.

1309
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:51,526
It's because of jerks like him
that I even have a job.

1310
01:34:54,572 --> 01:34:55,903
Had a job.

1311
01:35:08,753 --> 01:35:10,186
Can you believe that guy?

1312
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:14,083
Actually, I do.

1313
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:36,707
You...

1314
01:35:38,382 --> 01:35:40,179
complete me.

1315
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,119
- I might just have...
- Shut up.

1316
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:46,289
Just shut up.

1317
01:35:47,258 --> 01:35:49,249
You had me at "hello."

1318
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:18,786
No comment.

1319
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:27,286
This is off the record.

1320
01:36:32,603 --> 01:36:34,400
I came to apologize.

1321
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:37,130
I made some assumptions about you...

1322
01:36:37,275 --> 01:36:40,142
based on nothing, it turns out.

1323
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,814
- I guess Casey's right. My best friend...
- Don't worry about it. We're straight.

1324
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:52,146
I should've asked you.
But sometimes you're so guarded.

1325
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:55,691
I just don't wanna be another reason
for you to...

1326
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:00,857
I'm not someone who likes to get involved
past a certain point.

1327
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:04,832
And that point was about a week ago.

1328
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:15,504
Well, I just want to say I'm really sorry...

1329
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,639
and I didn't mean to hurt you.

1330
01:37:21,218 --> 01:37:22,617
You didn't.

1331
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:27,985
That's a relief.

1332
01:37:57,054 --> 01:37:59,989
- Hey, fella.
- Yeah, good. You?

1333
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,854
What you got there?

1334
01:38:03,994 --> 01:38:08,658
This? I figured maybe if my heart
stops beating, it wouldn't hurt so much.

1335
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:11,498
She hasn't called back?

1336
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,271
You want some coffee?

1337
01:38:22,713 --> 01:38:23,907
I want you to fix it.

1338
01:38:28,552 --> 01:38:29,814
I got nothing, Albert.

1339
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:34,323
You wanna do something?
We should get out tonight.

1340
01:38:34,425 --> 01:38:37,485
Honestly, I never knew I could feel like this.

1341
01:38:37,595 --> 01:38:40,189
I swear I'm going out of my mind.

1342
01:38:41,732 --> 01:38:44,166
I wanna throw myself off
of every building in New York.

1343
01:38:44,268 --> 01:38:48,762
I see a cab and I wanna dive in front of it,
because then I'll stop thinking about her.

1344
01:38:48,873 --> 01:38:51,603
Look, you will. Just give it time.

1345
01:38:51,709 --> 01:38:54,075
That's just it. I don't want to.

1346
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:57,639
I've waited my whole life
to feel this miserable.

1347
01:38:57,815 --> 01:39:00,511
If this is the only way
I can stay connected with her...

1348
01:39:00,618 --> 01:39:02,176
then this is who I have to be.

1349
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:06,415
No, you don't.
You can change, you can adapt.

1350
01:39:07,057 --> 01:39:09,753
You can make it
so you don't ever have to feel like this.

1351
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:10,849
Ever again.

1352
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:23,499
Oh, my God. You just don't get it, do you?

1353
01:39:24,508 --> 01:39:25,805
I get it.

1354
01:39:27,311 --> 01:39:28,710
Let me get this straight.

1355
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:32,144
You're selling this stuff,
but you don't believe in your own product.

1356
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:35,248
- Love is my life.
- No. Love is your job.

1357
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:51,591
You wanna jump out a plane
without a chute, be my guest.

1358
01:39:51,702 --> 01:39:53,761
But forgive me if I don't join you.

1359
01:39:55,005 --> 01:39:57,200
This isn't about love for you at all, is it?

1360
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:02,972
This whole time, I thought I was the coward.

1361
01:40:08,052 --> 01:40:10,145
- Where you going?
- Skydiving.

1362
01:40:41,252 --> 01:40:42,446
Taxi!

1363
01:41:16,186 --> 01:41:17,517
Mr. Hitchens.

1364
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:20,854
Miss Cole,
thank you very much for seeing me.

1365
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:23,085
You said it was a matter of life and death.

1366
01:41:24,595 --> 01:41:27,826
That man would've sold his soul
to make you happy.

1367
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:30,894
So what does that make you, the devil?

1368
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:38,138
My job is not to deceive, Miss Cole.
It's to create opportunities.

1369
01:41:39,543 --> 01:41:40,669
Like the boardroom.

1370
01:41:41,445 --> 01:41:43,504
- Would you have noticed him otherwise?
- Yes.

1371
01:41:43,614 --> 01:41:45,844
- Really?
- Eventually.

1372
01:41:50,421 --> 01:41:51,479
Maybe.

1373
01:41:55,259 --> 01:41:57,386
How did you know all that stuff about me?

1374
01:42:00,064 --> 01:42:01,861
Well, you really did your homework.

1375
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:07,702
Like at boarding school when everyone
used to tease me because I couldn't whistle.

1376
01:42:08,138 --> 01:42:11,574
And having him dance like a buffoon
knowing that I can't dance, either.

1377
01:42:12,276 --> 01:42:16,235
Then telling him to drop mustard
on his shirt, so I'd feel less like a dork.

1378
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:21,942
That was all you, right?

1379
01:42:22,586 --> 01:42:24,952
No. Hell, no.

1380
01:42:25,255 --> 01:42:26,347
That was him?

1381
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:28,951
That's got Albert written all over it.

1382
01:42:30,828 --> 01:42:32,591
Did you put him up to the inhaler?

1383
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:35,258
Stop it. He did not show you that.

1384
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:38,692
He chucked it right before he kissed me.

1385
01:42:39,336 --> 01:42:40,633
So, wait...

1386
01:42:41,438 --> 01:42:43,497
that stuff worked for you?

1387
01:42:45,643 --> 01:42:47,008
It was adorable.

1388
01:42:54,818 --> 01:42:56,149
What did you do?

1389
01:42:58,522 --> 01:42:59,750
Nothing.

1390
01:43:05,062 --> 01:43:06,825
Absolutely nothing.

1391
01:43:09,033 --> 01:43:10,261
That's good.

1392
01:43:12,236 --> 01:43:14,796
- This was your plan the whole time?
- Albert.

1393
01:43:14,905 --> 01:43:17,032
You sail off into the sunset with my girl?

1394
01:43:21,912 --> 01:43:25,905
You were like a brother to me!

1395
01:43:26,817 --> 01:43:29,547
- He came here for you.
- Who?

1396
01:43:29,653 --> 01:43:30,984
The guy you're choking.

1397
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,760
- I love you.
- I love you.

1398
01:43:44,868 --> 01:43:46,665
I really love you.

1399
01:43:50,274 --> 01:43:53,266
- I love you more.
- I love you more. I really do.

1400
01:43:56,013 --> 01:43:57,446
I got somewhere I gotta go.

1401
01:44:28,879 --> 01:44:31,177
- Yeah, who is it?
- Hitch.

1402
01:44:32,716 --> 01:44:33,774
Can I talk to you?

1403
01:44:42,292 --> 01:44:43,259
What?

1404
01:44:45,729 --> 01:44:46,889
You almost hit me.

1405
01:44:51,401 --> 01:44:55,735
Look, I just wanted to stop by, basically.

1406
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:58,671
See, this is the thing.

1407
01:45:05,048 --> 01:45:08,074
This is weird.
I don't have me behind the door, you know.

1408
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:10,277
Close your mouth.

1409
01:45:13,624 --> 01:45:16,855
Because I knew at some point I'd be...

1410
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:22,225
right here. But I thought that...

1411
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:30,163
everything would come out, but it's like...

1412
01:45:31,775 --> 01:45:33,072
That's throwing me off.

1413
01:45:38,649 --> 01:45:41,015
- Can we close the door?
- What?

1414
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:44,576
I'm sorry. Just, can we... I just need...

1415
01:45:44,721 --> 01:45:47,656
- Are you serious?
- No, just like this.

1416
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,423
What do you want, Hitch?

1417
01:45:55,532 --> 01:45:56,556
You.

1418
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:03,504
For a whole lot of reasons
that don't make any sense to me.

1419
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:08,074
I mean, what, we've been on three dates?

1420
01:46:08,912 --> 01:46:10,937
See, that's what's crazy.

1421
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:13,810
That's what's crazy, because I know.

1422
01:46:14,184 --> 01:46:15,515
I know deep...

1423
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:20,488
like just down, just in this area...

1424
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:23,259
that I just know...

1425
01:46:24,862 --> 01:46:26,386
that I want...

1426
01:46:27,164 --> 01:46:31,260
I want to be miserable.

1427
01:46:31,368 --> 01:46:34,166
Like, really miserable.

1428
01:46:34,705 --> 01:46:35,865
Because, hey...

1429
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:40,535
if that's what it takes
for me to be happy then...

1430
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:44,610
Wait, that didn't come out right.

1431
01:46:44,715 --> 01:46:47,047
What the hell is wrong with you?

1432
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:50,017
- Nothing!
- No, not you.

1433
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,589
I'm talking to me.

1434
01:47:14,711 --> 01:47:16,702
Alex Hitchens, Tom Reda.

1435
01:47:21,251 --> 01:47:22,809
I'll just put this in the car.

1436
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,695
Maybe it's like what you said.

1437
01:47:38,936 --> 01:47:43,032
We should just both go our separate ways
and then we'll do just fine.

1438
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:56,412
What if fine isn't good enough?

1439
01:48:01,792 --> 01:48:03,384
What if I want extraordinary?

1440
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:05,888
No such thing.

1441
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:20,501
I'm just as scared as you are, Sara.

1442
01:48:21,278 --> 01:48:24,338
But I'm right here, and our time is right now.

1443
01:48:24,815 --> 01:48:26,305
Well, what about before?

1444
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:29,715
I am a guy. Since when
do we get anything right the first time?

1445
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,288
I'm a realist,
and I know what love does to people.

1446
01:48:32,789 --> 01:48:34,416
- No, you don't.
- Keys.

1447
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:39,061
There you go. Right here.

1448
01:48:42,232 --> 01:48:44,996
I don't know who this is, and I don't care.

1449
01:48:45,736 --> 01:48:50,070
What I do know is he'll never feel about you
the way that I do.

1450
01:48:52,642 --> 01:48:55,304
- You know how to drive a stick?
- Both of you, shut up!

1451
01:49:02,285 --> 01:49:04,776
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1452
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:07,882
You'll never be fine, and neither will I!

1453
01:49:11,361 --> 01:49:12,658
Maybe I should drive.

1454
01:49:13,764 --> 01:49:15,925
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1455
01:49:16,099 --> 01:49:17,532
If that's what it takes.

1456
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:19,033
Sara, what happened?

1457
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:21,627
- He jumped on the car.
- Why?

1458
01:49:22,406 --> 01:49:24,033
Because that's what people do.

1459
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:28,342
They leap and hope to God they can fly.

1460
01:49:34,184 --> 01:49:35,412
Because otherwise...

1461
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,045
we just drop like a rock...

1462
01:49:39,723 --> 01:49:41,554
wondering the whole way down:

1463
01:49:42,526 --> 01:49:46,018
"Why in the hell did I jump?"

1464
01:49:47,798 --> 01:49:51,461
But here I am, Sara, falling.

1465
01:49:52,436 --> 01:49:56,566
And there's only one person
that makes me feel like I can fly.

1466
01:49:58,975 --> 01:50:00,135
That's you.

1467
01:50:05,482 --> 01:50:08,110
So, you kind of like me?

1468
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:10,278
No.

1469
01:50:11,455 --> 01:50:12,615
I love you.

1470
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:16,322
I love you, and I knew it from the first...

1471
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:29,666
If I say it back now, it'll sound so stupid.

1472
01:50:32,843 --> 01:50:37,041
This is the guy I was telling you about.
Hitch, that's my sister, Maria.

1473
01:50:37,147 --> 01:50:38,944
And that's her husband, Tom.

1474
01:50:43,487 --> 01:50:44,749
Her husband.

1475
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,997
Where's your date?

1476
01:51:28,565 --> 01:51:30,089
Don't have one.

1477
01:51:35,972 --> 01:51:37,701
I know. Shocking, huh?

1478
01:51:41,211 --> 01:51:43,941
Oh, my God!

1479
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:52,182
Are you all right?

1480
01:51:53,823 --> 01:51:55,313
Grandma, what happened?

1481
01:51:55,825 --> 01:51:59,124
This young lady just saved my life.

1482
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:05,960
Ask her to dance.

1483
01:52:07,237 --> 01:52:09,432
Well, if you insist.

1484
01:52:10,574 --> 01:52:13,566
- I'm Casey.
- Charles Wellington.

1485
01:52:14,844 --> 01:52:17,972
- And this...
- Forget it. Just go.

1486
01:52:31,595 --> 01:52:33,290
Basic principles:

1487
01:52:34,698 --> 01:52:35,858
There are none.
