1
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:45,824
Shit.

2
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,763
You pair of deuces
lookin' for work...

3
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:31,203
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here pronto.

4
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,814
Up on Brokeback...

5
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,651
the Forest Service has got
designated campsites...

6
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,384
on the allotments.

7
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,451
Them camps can be 3, 4 miles from
where we pasture the woollies.

8
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,987
Bad predator loss if there's
nobody lookin' after 'em at night.

9
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,763
Now, what I want
is a camp tender...

10
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:06,136
to stay in the main camp, where
the Forest Service says.

11
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,834
But the herder...

12
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,945
he's gonna pitch a pup tent
on the QT with the sheep...

13
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:13,071
and he's gonna sleep there.

14
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,912
You eat your supper
and breakfast in camp...

15
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,010
but you sleep
with the sheep 100%.

16
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,179
No fire, don't leave no sign.

17
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,414
You roll up that tent
every mornin'...

18
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:25,925
in case Forest Service
snoops around.

19
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,188
Yeah?

20
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,089
No.

21
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,393
[man chattering on phone)

22
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,458
No!

23
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,030
Not on your fuckin' life.

24
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:46,844
You got your dogs,
your .30-30, you sleep there.

25
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:51,510
Last summer I had goddamn near 25% loss.
I don't want that again.

26
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,111
You.

27
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,386
Fridays at noon,
be down at the bridge...

28
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,192
with your grocery list
and mules...

29
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:03,959
and somebody with supplies
will be there at the pick-up.

30
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,900
Tomorrow mornin' we'll
truck you up to the jump-off.

31
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,893
- Jack Twist.
- Ennis.

32
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,602
- Your folks just stop at Ennis?
- Del Mar.

33
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,539
Well, nice to know you,
Ennis Del Mar.

34
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,491
[man chattering on TV)

35
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,862
My second year up here.

36
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,398
Last year, one storm, the
lightnin' killed 42 sheep.

37
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,197
Thought I'd asphyxiate
from the smell.

38
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:23,009
Aguirre got all over my ass, like I
was supposed to control the weather.

39
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:27,307
But beats workin' for my old man.
Can't please my old man, no way.

40
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,680
That's why I took
to rodeoin'. You ever rodeo?

41
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,123
You know, I mean,
once in a while.

42
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,384
When I got the entry fee
in my pocket.

43
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,553
Yeah.

44
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,989
Are you from ranch people?

45
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,532
Yeah, I was.

46
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,169
Your folks run you off?

47
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,137
No, they run themselves off.
There was...

48
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,876
one curve in the road in
43 miles, and they miss it.

49
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,347
So the bank took the ranch...

50
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,512
and my brother and sister,
they raised me, mostly.

51
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,519
Shit, that's hard.

52
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,029
Can I? Thank you.

53
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,549
Don't let them stray.

54
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,521
Joe will have your ass
if you do.

55
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,218
Only thing,
don't never order soup.

56
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,127
Them soup boxes
are hard to pack.

57
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,529
Well, I don't eat soup.

58
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:59,501
You wanna watch it there. That
horse has a low startle point.

59
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,737
Doubt there's a filly
that could throw me.

60
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,075
Let's git, unless you wanna sit
around tyin' knots all day.

61
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:51,336
Oh, shit.

62
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,408
Can't wait till I get
my own spread...

63
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,746
and I won't have to put up with
Joe Aguirre's crap no more.

64
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,548
I'm savin' for a place myself.

65
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:05,955
Alma and me, we're gonna get married
when I come down off this mountain.

66
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,223
Shit, that stay with the
sheep, no fire bullshit.

67
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:14,532
Aguirre got no right makin' us
do somethin' against the rules.

68
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,375
No more beans.

69
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,616
Damn. Shit!

70
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,620
- I don't know.
- Something wrong?

71
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,124
Yeah, so what...

72
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,825
Why didn't we get the
powdered milk and the spuds?

73
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,390
That's all we got.

74
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,231
Well...

75
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,766
Here's next week's.

76
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:04,734
- Thought you didn't eat soup.
- Yeah, well, I'm sick of beans.

77
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,713
Too early in the summer
to be sick of beans.

78
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,713
Come on.

79
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,167
Come on. Come on.

80
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,181
Hold on.

81
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,816
Shit.

82
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,919
Come back here!

83
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,927
There...

84
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,834
All right. Fuck it.

85
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,207
Okay, you bastard.

86
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:46,979
Where the hell you been?

87
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,539
Been up with the sheep all day, I
get down here hungry as hell...

88
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,551
and all I find is beans.

89
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,152
What in the hell happened,
Ennis?

90
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,826
I come on a bear
is what happened.

91
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,359
Goddamn horse spooked
and the mules took off...

92
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,364
and scattered food everywhere.

93
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:09,699
Beans is about all we got left.
Got whiskey or somethin'?

94
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,699
Dumb-ass mule.

95
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:24,846
I can't believe that. God damn.

96
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,046
Let me see.

97
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,120
Shit.

98
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,121
Well, we gotta do somethin'
about this food situation.

99
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,001
Maybe I'll shoot
one of the sheep.

100
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,737
Yeah, what if
Aguirre finds out, huh?

101
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,773
We're supposed to guard
the sheep, not eat 'em.

102
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,299
What's the matter with you?
There are a thousand of 'em.

103
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,311
I'll stick with beans.

104
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,106
Well, I won't.

105
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,022
Yeah!

106
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,727
Gettin' tired
of your dumb-ass missin'.

107
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,402
Let's get a move on.

108
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,439
Don't want the Game and Fish
to catch us with no elk.

109
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,393
Come on. Shit.

110
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,966
Yeah, I'm commutin'
four hours a day.

111
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,905
I come in for breakfast,
I go back to the sheep.

112
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,408
Evenin', get 'em bedded down.

113
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,247
Come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

114
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,347
Spend half the night
checkin' for damn coyotes.

115
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,785
Aguirre got no right
to make me do this.

116
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,894
You wanna switch? I wouldn't
mind sleepin' out there.

117
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:21,799
That ain't the point. The point is,
we both ought to be in this camp.

118
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,731
Goddamn pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse.

119
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,839
I wouldn't mind
bein' out there.

120
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,511
Well, I'm happy
to switch with you...

121
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,175
but I warn you,
I can't cook worth a damn.

122
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,617
I am pretty good
with a can opener, though.

123
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,013
You can't be no worse
than me, then.

124
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,291
Here you go.

125
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,736
You won't get much sleep,
I'll tell you that.

126
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,535
Yup. Come on.

127
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,228
Shot a coyote up there.

128
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,861
It's a big son of a bitch. He had
balls on him the size of apples.

129
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,702
He looked like
he could eat himself a camel.

130
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,504
You want
some of this hot water?

131
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,736
It's all yours.

132
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,910
I don't rodeo much myself.

133
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:22,849
I mean, what's the point...

134
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,585
of ridin' some piece of stock
for eight seconds?

135
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,685
Money's a good point.
True enough.

136
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,860
If you don't get stomped
winnin' it, huh?

137
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,092
Yeah.

138
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,964
Well, my old man,
he was a bull rider.

139
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,038
Thank you.

140
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,005
Pretty well-known in his day.

141
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,006
Though he kept his secrets
to himself.

142
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,943
Never taught me a thing, never
once come to see me ride.

143
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,194
Your brother and sister
do right by you?

144
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,270
They did the best they could
after my folks was gone.

145
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,973
Considerin' they didn't
leave us nothin'...

146
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,403
but $24 in a coffee can.

147
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,346
I got me a year of high school.

148
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,313
That was before the transmission
went on the pickup.

149
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,787
And then my sis left. She married
a roughneck, moved to Casper.

150
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,656
And me and my brother...

151
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:39,256
we went and got ourselves some
work on a ranch up near Worland.

152
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:42,268
Till I was 10.
Then he got married.

153
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,839
And no more room for me.

154
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:53,873
That's how come me end up here.

155
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,149
What?

156
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,863
Man, that's more words than you've
spoke in the past two weeks.

157
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,564
Hell, that's the most
I've spoke in a year.

158
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,873
But my dad,
he was a fine roper.

159
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:25,274
Didn't rodeo much, though.

160
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,939
He thought rodeo cowboys
was all fuck-ups.

161
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,512
The hell they are.

162
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,416
Well...

163
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:42,556
There you go.

164
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:48,130
I'm spurrin' his guts out! Wavin'
to the girls in the stands!

165
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,762
He's kickin' me to high heaven,
but he don't jackboard me! No!

166
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,967
I think my dad was right.

167
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,055
Tent don't look right.

168
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,592
Well, it ain't
goin' nowhere. Let it be.

169
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,999
That harmonica don't sound
quite right either.

170
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,502
That's 'cause it got kind of
flattened when that mare threw me.

171
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,162
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

172
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,673
I thought you said
that mare couldn't throw you.

173
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,232
She got lucky.

174
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:08,205
Yeah, well, if I got lucky, that
harmonica would've broke in two.

175
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:15,917
♪ I know I shall meet you
on that final day ♪

176
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:21,484
♪ Water-walking Jesus,
take me away! ♫

177
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:25,791
- Very good.
- Oh, yeah.

178
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,094
My mama, she believes
in the Pentecost.

179
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,432
Oh, yeah?

180
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,574
What exactly is the Pentecost?

181
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,406
I mean, my folks,
they was Methodist.

182
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,336
The Pentecost.

183
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,139
I don't know, I don't know
what the Pentecost is.

184
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:47,676
Mom never explained it to me. I
guess it's when the world ends...

185
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,915
and fellas like you and me,
we march off to hell.

186
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,684
Speak for yourself.

187
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,287
You may be a sinner, but I
ain't yet had the opportunity.

188
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,231
Thank you.

189
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:06,004
Shit!

190
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,807
I'm gonna go up
to the sheep now.

191
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,367
Give 'em hell.

192
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:19,008
No, I'm...

193
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:24,681
You can hardly stand. It's too
late to go to them sheep.

194
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,452
Well, you got an extra blanket?

195
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:34,431
I'll just roll up out here,
grab 40 winks...

196
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,235
and I'll ride out
at first light.

197
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,971
You'll freeze your ass off
when that fire dies down.

198
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,341
Oh, that's good.

199
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:47,380
You're better off
sleepin' in the tent.

200
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,539
Yeah.

201
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,548
All right.

202
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:30,286
- Ennis!
- What?

203
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,654
Just quit your yammerin'
and get in here!

204
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,115
Come on, come on.

205
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,095
What are you doin'?

206
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,824
See you for supper.

207
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:59,721
Yeah. Come on.

208
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,033
Come on.

209
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,756
This is a one-shot thing
we got goin' on here.

210
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,430
It's nobody's business
but ours.

211
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,035
You know I ain't queer.

212
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,470
Me, neither.

213
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,646
I'm sorry.

214
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,341
It's all right.

215
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,044
It's all right.

216
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,181
Lie back. Come on.

217
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,514
Twist.

218
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,921
Your Uncle Harold's in
the hospital with pneumonia.

219
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:55,290
Docs don't expect
he'll make it.

220
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:59,323
Your ma sent me to tell you,
so here I am.

221
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:03,731
Bad news.

222
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:08,234
There ain't nothin' I can do
about it up here, I guess.

223
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,868
There's not much you can do
about it down there, neither.

224
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:17,082
Not unless you can
cure pneumonia.

225
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,379
God damn! Jesus!

226
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:55,352
Them sheep will drift if I don't
get back up there tonight!

227
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:58,413
You'll get pitched off your
mount in a storm like this.

228
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:00,789
You'll wish
you hadn't tried it!

229
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,495
It's too cold! Close it up!

230
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,798
What are we
supposed to do now, huh?

231
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:20,174
Get on in there and untangle 'em
Chilean sheep out of ours, I guess.

232
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:23,709
Oh, where is it? Shit!

233
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:31,116
God, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!

234
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:36,323
We gotta try. The least we can do
is get the count right for Aguirre.

235
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:39,194
Fuck Aguirre!
Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.

236
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,199
What if we need to work for him again?
You think of that?

237
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,498
We gotta stick this out, Jack.

238
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:03,880
You'll run them sheep off again
if you don't quiet down.

239
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,089
What are you doing?

240
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,228
Aguirre came by again.

241
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,200
Says my uncle didn't die
after all.

242
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:50,596
Says bring 'em down.

243
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:53,764
Bring 'em down, why?
It's the middle of August.

244
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,202
Says there's a storm comin',
movin' in from the Pacific.

245
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,040
Worse than this one.

246
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,045
That snow barely stuck an hour.

247
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:08,685
Besides, that son of a bitch, he's
cuttin' us out a whole month's pay.

248
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,154
It ain't right.

249
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:13,587
Well...

250
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,553
I can spare you a loan, bud,
if you're short on cash.

251
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,495
Give it to you
when we get to Signal.

252
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,555
I don't need your money, huh?

253
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:24,062
You know, I ain't in
the poorhouse. Shit!

254
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,136
All right.

255
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,264
Time to get goin', cowboy.

256
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,816
Come here!
This ain't no rodeo, cowboy!

257
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:20,188
Oh, shit!

258
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,877
Ennis. Ennis.

259
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,620
Come here. You okay?

260
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:56,851
- You okay?
- Yeah.

261
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:49,545
Some of these never went
up there with you.

262
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,214
Count ain't what
I'd hoped for, neither.

263
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,421
You ranch stiffs,
you ain't never no good.

264
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,440
Wanna give it some gas?

265
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:28,476
I can't believe I left
my damn shirt up there.

266
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,681
Yeah.

267
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,587
You gonna do this again
next summer?

268
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,027
Well, maybe not.

269
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:42,200
Like I said, me and Alma is
gettin' married in November.

270
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,394
So...

271
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:46,967
I'll try to get somethin'
on a ranch, I guess.

272
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,302
And you?

273
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:55,211
Might go up to my daddy's place and
give him a hand through the winter.

274
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,375
I might be back.

275
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:01,209
If the Army don't get me.

276
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:09,526
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, huh?

277
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:11,723
Right.

278
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,428
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

279
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,672
"And forgive us
our trespasses..."

280
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:38,512
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us."

281
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:42,020
"Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."

282
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,421
"For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever. Amen."

283
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,759
Under the powers
vested in me...

284
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:52,422
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

285
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,733
You may kiss the bride.
And if you don't, I will.

286
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:17,022
- You all right?
- No.

287
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:22,185
Stop!

288
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:24,726
No, please don't!

289
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,331
My old lady's tryin' to
get me to quit this job.

290
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:37,205
She says I'm gettin' too old to be
breakin' my back shovelin' asphalt.

291
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:40,973
I told her strong backs and
weak minds runs in the family.

292
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,049
She didn't think
that was too funny.

293
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:46,209
I told her it keeps me fit.

294
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:51,487
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

295
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:56,791
Pulled in last night.
Didn't want to wake you up.

296
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,860
Oh, no, I was just...

297
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:02,931
I thought I'd tell you before
the Sergeant showed up.

298
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,265
Parking this trailer
on the beach is illegal.

299
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:25,515
Yeah!

300
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,957
Well,
look what the wind blew in.

301
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,258
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.

302
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:39,463
I was wonderin' if you was
needin' any help this summer.

303
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,768
You're wastin' your time here.

304
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,035
What, you ain't got nothin'?

305
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:48,647
Nothin' up on Brokeback?

306
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:52,643
I ain't got no work for you.

307
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,990
Ennis Del Mar
ain't been around, has he?

308
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:10,727
You boys sure found a way to
make the time pass up there.

309
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:14,199
Twist...

310
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:17,643
you guys wasn't gettin' paid to leave
the dogs baby-sit the sheep...

311
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,803
while you stemmed the rose.

312
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,943
Now get the hell
out of my trailer.

313
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,518
[man chattering on TV)

314
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,561
How my girls doing?

315
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,736
All right. Jenny's still
got a runny nose.

316
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,655
Ennis, could you wipe
Alma Jr.'s nose?

317
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:48,361
If I had three hands, I could.

318
00:47:49,735 --> 00:47:51,703
Come here. Come here. Oh!

319
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:20,927
Girls all right?

320
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:24,765
Yeah.
Jenny stopped her coughin'.

321
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,938
I think I should take the
girls into town this weekend.

322
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:32,443
Get 'em an ice cream.
Somethin'.

323
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,547
Can't we move to town?

324
00:48:40,452 --> 00:48:43,148
I'm tired of these
lonesome old ranches.

325
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:47,316
No one's around
for Junior to play with.

326
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:49,287
Besides,
I'm scared for Jenny...

327
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:52,194
scared if she has another one
of 'em bad asthma spells.

328
00:48:52,264 --> 00:48:54,460
No, rent in town is too high.

329
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:01,562
There's a cheap place in
Riverton, over the Laundromat.

330
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,575
I bet I could
fix it up real nice.

331
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,041
I bet you could fix this place
up real nice if you wanted to.

332
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:09,512
Ennis.

333
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:12,882
I know you'd like it, too.

334
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:18,515
Real home, other kids
for the girls to play with.

335
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,218
Not so lonely
like you were raised.

336
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,429
You don't want 'em
to be so lonely, do you?

337
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,865
Yeah.

338
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,606
Come here.

339
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:45,611
It ain't so lonely now, is it?

340
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:53,488
- Are you sure the girls are asleep?
- Yeah.

341
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:07,769
Come here.

342
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:20,912
Ennis.

343
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,583
Let 'er rip and snort, boys!

344
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:28,183
Jack Twist,
hangin' on for dear life!

345
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:32,361
And down he goes!
Watch out there, fella!

346
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,161
He's comin' for you.
Send in the clowns!

347
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,898
- Okay, a fine ride by Mr. Twist.
- Shit!

348
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,495
Four seconds for him.

349
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:45,204
Give 'em a hand, folks,
our very own rodeo clowns!

350
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:50,171
Give us a beer, Doug.

351
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,930
I'd like to buy
Jimbo here a beer.

352
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:10,667
Best damn rodeo clown
I've ever worked with.

353
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,436
No thanks, cowboy.

354
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:16,872
If I was to let every rodeo
hand I pulled a bull off of...

355
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:19,843
buy me liquor, I'd have
been a alcoholic long ago.

356
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:29,348
Pullin' bulls off of you
buckaroos is just my job.

357
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:32,953
So save your money for
your next entry fee, cowboy.

358
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,297
You ever try calf ropin'?

359
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:57,945
Do I look like I can afford
a fuckin' ropin' horse?

360
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:15,761
Shouldn't we move
a little closer?

361
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:19,566
No. Come on, let's don't.
Jenny'll get scared.

362
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:26,439
Look at this crowd!

363
00:52:26,845 --> 00:52:30,281
Bound to be a lot of pussy on
the hoof in a crowd like this.

364
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,282
All swelled up
with patriotic feeling...

365
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,114
and ready to be
humped like a frog.

366
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:36,654
So, where do you figure
the most pussy is at?

367
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,382
Las Vegas or California?

368
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:39,685
Hell, I don't know...

369
00:52:39,758 --> 00:52:42,693
but if you make it between Montana
and Wyoming, I'd take Wyoming...

370
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:46,595
Hey! You might want to keep it
down, I got two little girls here.

371
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:49,634
Fuck you. Asshole.

372
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:53,230
Probably quit givin' it to his
wife after his kids was born.

373
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:55,773
- You know what that's like.
- Yeah.

374
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:01,274
Ennis, let's move.
Let's just move, okay?

375
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,077
Now, I don't want
any trouble from you.

376
00:53:07,152 --> 00:53:09,279
You need to shut your slop-bucket
mouths, you hear me?

377
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:11,117
You ought to listen
to your old lady, then.

378
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,022
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Move somewhere else.

379
00:53:15,427 --> 00:53:18,760
What about it? You wanna lose about
half your fuckin' teeth, huh?

380
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,424
Not tonight, bud.
I'd sure rather not.

381
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,705
Here she comes,
ladies and gentlemen!

382
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:35,712
Oh, boy, look at her fly!

383
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,716
This is Lureen Newsome from
right here in Childress, Texas!

384
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:41,980
Come on, folks, she's gotta hear
it, let's give her a big hand!

385
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,578
She's turnin' on two!

386
00:53:44,856 --> 00:53:46,483
She's around three!

387
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:49,322
Come on, folks! Help her home!

388
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:51,829
Come on! Come on!

389
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,731
And the time is 16 and 9!

390
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,639
Here's Cheyenne Hodson
from Cody, Wyoming!

391
00:54:04,843 --> 00:54:06,333
Come on, girl!

392
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,681
She's headed around two!

393
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:13,511
- Is there anybody here from Wyoming?
- Ma'am.

394
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:15,314
How about it, folks?

395
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,280
Come on, Cheyenne!

396
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:24,227
And her time is 17 and 2!

397
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:29,224
Here comes Scotty Gri·iths,
out of Lubbock, Texas.

398
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,859
Come on, Scotty!

399
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:34,370
Let's give Scotty Griths
a big hand, folks.

400
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,574
Better luck next time, cowboy.

401
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:39,702
Boy, I tell you, folks, what a
heck of a way to make a living!

402
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:41,746
Next up is an up-and-comer!

403
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:46,750
Jack Twist from all the way up
in Lightning Flat, Wyoming.

404
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:51,455
He's on board Sleepy today!
Let's hope he's not!

405
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:52,613
Okay!

406
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,852
There they go, folks!
And look at Sleepy go, boy!

407
00:54:56,928 --> 00:55:01,559
He's broke free today, folks!
Come on, spin and spin and spin!

408
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:06,937
Oh, boy! Good ride, cowboy! Well,
let's see what the judges say!

409
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:11,041
I tell you, folks, that sure looked
like the winnin' ride to me!

410
00:55:29,594 --> 00:55:31,323
You know that girl?

411
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,223
I sure do. Lureen Newsome.

412
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:37,795
Her dad sells farm equipment.
I mean, big farm equipment.

413
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:40,668
$100,000 tractors,
shit like that.

414
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,413
What are you waitin' for,
cowboy? A matin' call?

00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:05,925

427
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:39,614
You don't think
I'm too fast, do you?

428
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:42,359
Maybe we should
put the brakes on?

429
00:57:42,994 --> 00:57:46,328
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you're goin'.

430
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:59,674
You are in a hurry.
My daddy's the hurry.

431
00:57:59,744 --> 00:58:02,475
He expects me home
with the car by midnight.

432
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:15,149
Come here, come here.

433
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:17,823
- Hi, Monroe.
- Hey, Ennis.

434
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:18,885
Is Alma here?

435
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,328
Yeah, she's in
the condiments aisle.

436
00:58:20,398 --> 00:58:22,161
- The what?
- Ketchup.

437
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:23,761
Thanks.

438
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,659
Your boy gonna play
again this year?

439
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:27,227
- Excuse us!
- Yeah, excuse me.

440
00:58:27,305 --> 00:58:30,001
Hey, honey. Honey,
what are y'all doing here?

441
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:31,366
Big hurry.

442
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:34,378
My boss called and, well, he
wants me to go up to the ranch.

443
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:35,435
Mama.

444
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,106
I guess all the heifers
must've decided...

445
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,706
to calve at the same time.

446
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:40,751
I figured I could
drop the girls off with you.

447
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,252
Ennis, well...

448
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,948
I got a million things I gotta
do here before I can leave.

449
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,581
I don't get off
for another three hours.

450
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:49,627
Mama, I need crayons.
Not now, Alma.

451
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,622
Ennis, please, you promised
you'd take them tonight.

452
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:55,462
Alma, I can't afford not to be
there when the heifers calve.

453
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,501
Right, it'd be my job
if I lose any of 'em.

454
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,230
What about my job?

455
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,906
Okay, all right,
I'll call my sister.

456
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:07,376
I'll see if she can take 'em.
All right. All right.

457
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,573
You be a good girl
for your mama, all right?

458
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:10,978
I'll be half the night.

459
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,983
Bring home some ground steaks
if you think of it.

460
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,418
Come here. Oh, Alma, please!

461
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:20,986
Oh, boy.

462
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:23,524
- Okay.
- Monroe, I'm so sorry.

463
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:25,688
It's okay. It's okay, Alma.

464
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:28,330
I'll clean this up just as
soon as I call my sister...

465
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:29,526
to come get the girls.

466
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,001
Really, Alma, it's okay.
I'll get it.

467
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,664
Alma, come with me.
Watch your feet.

468
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:35,965
Alma.

469
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:38,940
It's just like my hand.

470
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,172
Honey, got a surprise for you.

471
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:42,806
Hey.

472
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:47,646
I got two whole boxes
of formula for you.

473
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:48,742
You did?

474
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,789
- 120 cans.
- 120?

475
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:53,346
L.D., where did you put 'em?

476
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:56,360
Oh, hell, back seat of the
car, where I left 'em.

477
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,159
Rodeo can get 'em.

478
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:06,836
L.D., I can already see
who little Bobby looks like.

479
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:08,098
Good job, little girl.

480
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,800
He's the spittin' image
of his grandpa.

481
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:14,871
Isn't he just the spittin'
image of his grandpa?

482
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:18,606
Yeah.

483
01:00:21,419 --> 01:00:23,216
Look at those eyes.

484
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:49,971
Hey.

485
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,015
Hey, honey.

486
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:00,819
Hey, Ennis, you know
somebody, name of Jack?

487
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:05,460
Maybe. Why?

488
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:08,498
'Cause you got a postcard.
It come general delivery.

489
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:23,677
Is he somebody
you cowboyed with, or what?

490
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,776
No, Jack, he rodeos, mostly.

491
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:31,854
We was fishin' buddies.

492
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,495
You can color that one, too.

493
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,554
I'll color the beach.

494
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:23,906
Maybe we could
get a baby-sitter.

495
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,936
Take your friend
to the Knife and Fork?

496
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:30,504
No, Jack ain't
the restaurant type.

497
01:02:31,282 --> 01:02:34,183
We'll more likely
just go out and get drunk.

498
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,316
That's if he shows.

499
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,795
Okay, we take one more bite, and
then you're finished with dinner.

500
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,799
There, that's a good bite.
All right, you're excused.

501
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,796
Please. Thank you.

502
01:03:13,424 --> 01:03:15,153
Jack fuckin' Twist.

503
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:21,388
Son of a bitch.

504
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:28,398
Come here.

505
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:31,831
Alma, this is Jack Twist.

506
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,404
And, Jack,
this is my wife, Alma.

507
01:04:34,472 --> 01:04:36,064
- Howdy.
- Hello.

508
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:39,336
You got a kid.

509
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:42,436
Yeah, I got two little girls.
Alma Jr. and Jenny.

510
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,710
- I got a boy.
- Yeah?

511
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:47,842
Eight months old. Smiles a lot.

512
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,550
I married the prettiest little
gal in Childress, Texas.

513
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:53,147
- Yeah?
- Lureen.

514
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,658
So me and Jack, we're gonna head out
and get ourselves a drink. Yeah?

515
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:02,900
Sure enough.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

516
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:04,665
We might not
get back tonight...

517
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,931
when we get to drinkin'
and talkin' and all.

518
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,130
Ennis?

519
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:10,541
Would you get me
a pack of smokes?

520
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:13,509
If you need smokes, Alma, they're
in the top pocket of my blue shirt.

521
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,204
There in the bedroom.

522
01:05:26,824 --> 01:05:30,317
Four years. Damn!
Yeah, four years.

523
01:05:33,564 --> 01:05:35,760
Didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

524
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,364
I figured you were sore
from that punch.

525
01:05:40,204 --> 01:05:43,139
Right next summer,
I drove back up to Brokeback.

526
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:45,335
Talked to Aguirre
about a job, and...

527
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:48,072
He told me you hadn't
been back, so I left.

528
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:51,806
Went down to Texas
for rodeoin'.

529
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,718
That's how I met Lureen.

530
01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:58,749
Made $2,000 that year,
bull ridin'. Nearly starved.

531
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,193
Lureen's old man makes serious
money, farm machine business.

532
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:06,355
Of course, he hates my guts.

533
01:06:10,768 --> 01:06:13,931
And the Army didn't get you?
No, too busted up.

534
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,436
And rodeoin' ain't what
it was in my daddy's day.

535
01:06:16,507 --> 01:06:18,908
Got out
while I could still walk.

536
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:24,971
Swear to God, I didn't know we was
goin' to get into this again.

537
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,709
Yes I did.
I red-lined it all the way.

538
01:06:29,787 --> 01:06:31,812
I couldn't get here
fast enough.

539
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:36,051
What about you?
Me? I don't know.

540
01:06:39,897 --> 01:06:41,365
I don't know.

541
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:49,396
Old Brokeback got us good,
don't it?

542
01:06:54,879 --> 01:06:57,006
What are we gonna do now?

543
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:03,319
I doubt there's nothin'
we can do.

544
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:10,123
So now I'm stuck
with what I got here.

545
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:17,860
Makin' a livin' is
about all I got time for now.

546
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:42,950
Hey.

547
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,059
Well, me and Jack is headed up
the mountain for a day or two.

548
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,360
Do ourselves a little fishin'.

549
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:59,066
You know, your friend could come
inside, have a cup of coffee.

550
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:00,870
Well, he's from Texas.

551
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:03,972
Texans don't drink coffee?

552
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,719
You sure that foreman won't
fire you for takin' off?

553
01:08:15,793 --> 01:08:17,727
You know, that foreman,
he owes me.

554
01:08:17,795 --> 01:08:21,629
I worked through a blizzard last Christmas.
You remember that?

555
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,560
Besides, I'll only be
a couple of days.

556
01:08:27,972 --> 01:08:30,167
Bring fish, Daddy.
A big, big one!

557
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,977
Come here. Come here.

558
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:46,420
Come here.

559
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,560
See you Sunday, latest.

560
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:03,871
I'm starvin'. Want to
get somethin' to eat?

561
01:09:03,941 --> 01:09:04,965
Yup.

562
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,738
Last one in!

563
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:56,687
Is there anything interestin'
up there in heaven?

564
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:59,658
Well, I was just sending up
a prayer of thanks.

565
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,593
For what?

566
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:06,232
For you forgettin'
to bring that harmonica.

567
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:08,704
I'm enjoying
the peace and quiet.

568
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:16,436
You know it could be like
this, just like this, always.

569
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:19,510
Yeah? How do you figure that?

570
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:26,519
What if you and me had
a little ranch somewhere...

571
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:31,428
a little cow-and-calf operation?
It'd be a sweet life.

572
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:33,596
I mean, hell,
Lureen's old man...

573
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:35,757
you bet he'd give me
a down payment to get lost.

574
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,529
I mean, he more or less
already said it.

575
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,099
No, I...

576
01:10:43,107 --> 01:10:46,099
I told you
it ain't gonna be that way.

577
01:10:49,113 --> 01:10:50,478
You know...

578
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:54,375
you got your wife
and baby in Texas.

579
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:58,178
You know,
I got my life in Riverton.

580
01:10:58,956 --> 01:11:00,219
Is that so?

581
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:04,494
You and Alma, that's a life?
Now you shut up about Alma.

582
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,359
This ain't her fault.

583
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:10,464
The bottom line is...

584
01:11:11,602 --> 01:11:13,627
we're around each other...

585
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:16,701
and this thing grabs hold
of us again...

586
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,405
in the wrong place...

587
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,974
in the wrong time...

588
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:24,171
and we're dead.

589
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:28,084
I tell you...

590
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:32,054
there were these two old guys
ranched up together down home.

591
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:35,515
Earl and Rich.

592
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:38,728
And they was a joke in town...

593
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:41,629
even though they were
pretty tough old birds.

594
01:11:46,937 --> 01:11:49,565
Anyway, they found Earl dead...

595
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,708
in an irrigation ditch.

596
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,246
They took a tire iron to him,
spurred him up...

597
01:11:57,381 --> 01:12:00,475
and drug him around by
his dick till it pulled off.

598
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:06,947
- You seen this?
- Yeah, I was what? Nine years old.

599
01:12:09,293 --> 01:12:12,456
My daddy, he made sure
me and my brother seen it.

600
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,561
Hell, for all I know,
he done the job.

601
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:25,474
Two guys living together?
No way.

602
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:29,875
Now, we can get together
once in a while...

603
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:33,144
way the hell out in the
middle of nowhere, but...

604
01:12:33,884 --> 01:12:35,579
"Once in a while."

605
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:38,845
Every four fucking years?

606
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:43,149
Well, if you can't fix it,
Jack, you gotta stand it.

607
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:48,064
For how long?

608
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,494
As long as we can ride it.

609
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,942
There ain't no reins
on this one.

610
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:17,619
It's nearly suppertime.

611
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:18,752
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

612
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:19,921
To work!

613
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:22,397
I thought you had the day off!
Well, you thought wrong!

614
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:24,866
The girls need to be fed.
Well, you take care of it!

615
01:13:24,935 --> 01:13:27,165
Alma! Alma!

616
01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:29,303
Supper's on the stove!

617
01:13:29,373 --> 01:13:31,341
No one's eatin'
unless you're servin' it!

618
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:33,570
I already promised
I'd take the extra shift!

619
01:13:33,644 --> 01:13:36,135
Fucking tell 'em
you made a mistake, then!

620
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:38,579
God damn it, Alma! Alma!

621
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:50,556
You girls need
a push or somethin'?

622
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:51,719
No.

623
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:02,962
Listen to her purr, gentlemen!

624
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,440
You ain't gonna get that
with your Caddy!

625
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:08,602
I told you what she could do,
and now let me show you.

626
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:14,548
Say, didn't that pissant
used to ride the bulls?

627
01:14:16,987 --> 01:14:18,511
He used to try.

628
01:14:51,388 --> 01:14:54,187
Honey, have you seen
my blue parka?

629
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:56,584
Last time I seen it,
you was in it...

630
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,822
day we had that big ice storm.

631
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,758
Well, could have sworn
I seen it in here.

632
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:05,666
You know...

633
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:08,730
you've been going up
to Wyoming all these years.

634
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:11,638
Why can't your buddy come
down here to Texas and fish?

635
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,336
Because the Bighorn Mountains
ain't in Texas.

636
01:15:14,478 --> 01:15:17,470
And I don't think that his pickup
could make it down here, anyway.

637
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:20,244
New model comin' in this week,
remember?

638
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:23,650
You're the best
combine salesman we got.

639
01:15:24,321 --> 01:15:26,016
You're the only
combine salesman, in fact.

640
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:29,025
Yeah, I'll be back in a week. That
is, unless I freeze to death...

641
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,719
and I'll freeze
if I don't find that parka.

642
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:32,922
Well, I don't have
your goddamn parka.

643
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:35,863
You know, you're worse than Bobby
when it comes to losin' stuff.

644
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:37,958
Well, speakin' of Bobby,
did you call his school...

645
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,060
about gettin' him a tutor?

646
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,968
I thought you were gonna call.

647
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,667
- I complain too much. That teacher don't like me.
- Right.

648
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:48,109
- Now it's your turn.
- Okay, fine, so I'll call later.

649
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:52,107
Right. Fine.

650
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,642
Goodbye.

comin' down here.

Ennis, they got an opening
over at the power company.

657
01:16:23,346 --> 01:16:24,871
Might be good pay.

658
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:28,145
Well, as clumsy as I am,
I'd probably get electrocuted.

659
01:16:28,218 --> 01:16:30,653
Daddy, the church picnic's
next weekend.

660
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,814
Will you be back from fishing
by next weekend?

661
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,721
Please, Daddy? Please!

662
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:37,658
Well, all right, as long as
I don't have to sing.

I've been trying to call you
for hours.

It's Saturday night, you know,
we could still smarten up...

to the church social.

- Yes, thank you.
- Do you mind?

857
01:35:12,408 --> 01:35:15,275
No, it's all right. Go ahead.
All right.

858
01:35:16,312 --> 01:35:17,540
Pardon us.

859
01:35:17,613 --> 01:35:19,411
Thank you for asking me
to dance with you.

860
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:21,643
I really appreciate that.
Randall never does.

861
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:23,515
Last time I did,
I think it was our wedding.

862
01:35:23,586 --> 01:35:25,952
It's a good thing you and Lureen
happened along when you did...

863
01:35:26,021 --> 01:35:28,149
or else we'd still be stuck
on the side of the road...

864
01:35:28,224 --> 01:35:29,486
in that darn pickup.

865
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,049
I told Randall
we ought to take the car.

866
01:35:31,126 --> 01:35:32,651
Of course,
he'd never listen to me.

867
01:35:32,728 --> 01:35:35,720
He wouldn't listen to me
if he was goin' deaf tomorrow.

868
01:35:35,798 --> 01:35:38,858
I told him it'd take more than
chewing gum and baling wire...

869
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,493
to fix that pickup.

870
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,697
Well, he's never been
very mechanical, though.

871
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:47,440
Come over here and ask...

872
01:35:54,216 --> 01:35:56,344
You ever notice how a woman
will powder her nose...

873
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:58,353
before she goes to a party?

874
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:01,856
And then she'll powder it
again once the party's over.

875
01:36:02,157 --> 01:36:05,650
I mean, why powder your nose
just to go home and go to bed?

876
01:36:05,728 --> 01:36:07,059
Don't know.

877
01:36:07,896 --> 01:36:09,262
Even if I wanted to know...

878
01:36:09,331 --> 01:36:12,597
I couldn't get a word in with
Lashawn long enough to ask.

879
01:36:12,668 --> 01:36:16,002
Woman talks a blue streak.
Lively little gal.

880
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:26,039
You'll like working
for Roy Taylor.

881
01:36:26,115 --> 01:36:29,312
- He's solid, Roy.
- Yeah, Roy. He's a good old boy.

882
01:36:34,723 --> 01:36:37,556
He's got a little cabin
down on Lake Kemp.

883
01:36:38,894 --> 01:36:41,295
Got a crappie house,
little boat.

884
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:44,356
Said I could use it
whenever I want.

885
01:36:48,103 --> 01:36:50,732
We ought to go down there
some weekend.

886
01:36:51,573 --> 01:36:54,008
Drink a little whiskey,
fish some.

887
01:36:55,411 --> 01:36:57,675
Get away, you know?

888
01:37:00,883 --> 01:37:02,373
That was right out of SMU.

889
01:37:02,451 --> 01:37:04,920
I could've had my pick of pretty
much any job in North Dallas.

890
01:37:04,987 --> 01:37:07,353
So my pick was Neiman Marcus,
which was a disaster...

891
01:37:07,423 --> 01:37:10,517
because, honey, where clothes is
concerned, I got no resistance.

892
01:37:10,592 --> 01:37:13,858
I was spending more than I made.
More than Randall ever will make.

893
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:14,919
We come out here...

894
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:17,090
thinkin' that ranchin' was
still big hats and Marlboros.

895
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,100
Boy, were we behind the times.

896
01:37:35,718 --> 01:37:37,913
Hey there, Junior. You ready?

897
01:37:53,168 --> 01:37:54,898
What do you think?

898
01:37:55,738 --> 01:37:59,037
Your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?

899
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:03,743
Don't know. Maybe he's not
the marrying kind.

900
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:08,445
You don't think so?

901
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:11,746
Or you don't think
I'm the one for him?

902
01:38:14,523 --> 01:38:16,252
You're good enough.

903
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:24,527
You don't say much,
but you get your point across.

904
01:38:26,702 --> 01:38:29,034
Sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

905
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,033
All right.

906
01:38:33,876 --> 01:38:36,402
You're stayin'
on your feet, cowboy.

907
01:38:37,513 --> 01:38:39,003
Excuse me, darling.

908
01:39:01,904 --> 01:39:05,567
So I'll pick you and Jenny up
next weekend, after church.

909
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:08,134
Fine.

910
01:39:11,814 --> 01:39:13,304
You all right?

911
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:15,674
Yes.

912
01:39:16,885 --> 01:39:18,353
Are you sure?

913
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:24,786
Daddy, I was thinking, what
with the new baby and all...

914
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:27,261
Ma and Monroe have been
awful strict on me.

915
01:39:27,329 --> 01:39:29,423
More on me than Jenny even.

916
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:32,664
I was thinkin',
maybe I could...

917
01:39:34,837 --> 01:39:37,237
Maybe I could come
stay with you.

918
01:39:38,407 --> 01:39:41,240
I'd be an awful good help,
I know I would.

919
01:39:41,677 --> 01:39:44,669
Now, you know
I ain't set up for that.

920
01:39:46,515 --> 01:39:48,643
With the roundup comin'...

921
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:51,115
I won't ever be home.

922
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:54,487
It's all right, Daddy.

923
01:39:54,756 --> 01:39:58,716
I'm not sayin' that I wouldn't...
It's all right, I understand.

924
01:40:01,096 --> 01:40:03,326
Well, see you on Sunday, then.

925
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:05,357
Bye.

926
01:40:07,903 --> 01:40:09,496
Bye, sweetheart.

927
01:40:39,034 --> 01:40:41,332
Going to snow tonight for sure.

928
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:43,629
Yup.

929
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,738
All this time and you ain't
found nobody else to marry?

930
01:40:56,552 --> 01:40:57,951
I been puttin' the blocks...

931
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,887
to a good-lookin' little gal
over in Riverton.

932
01:41:02,391 --> 01:41:06,293
She's a waitress. Wants to go
to nursing school or somethin'.

933
01:41:09,264 --> 01:41:10,630
I don't know.

934
01:41:14,136 --> 01:41:16,161
What about you and Lureen?

935
01:41:18,674 --> 01:41:21,473
Lureen's good at making hard deals
in the machinery business...

936
01:41:21,543 --> 01:41:23,978
but as far as
our marriage goes...

937
01:41:24,513 --> 01:41:26,743
we could do it over the phone.

938
01:41:36,658 --> 01:41:39,389
I kind of got this thing
going with...

939
01:41:40,295 --> 01:41:42,958
a ranch foreman's wife
over in Rutters.

940
01:41:43,332 --> 01:41:44,993
- What?
- I'm bound to get shot...

941
01:41:45,067 --> 01:41:48,400
by Lureen or her husband each
time I slip off to see her.

942
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:51,596
You probably deserve it.

943
01:41:58,547 --> 01:42:00,106
Tell you what.

944
01:42:05,153 --> 01:42:06,678
The truth is...

945
01:42:13,662 --> 01:42:16,961
sometimes I miss you so much,
I can hardly stand it.

946
01:42:59,241 --> 01:43:01,971
I guess I'll head up
on to Lightning Flat.

947
01:43:03,345 --> 01:43:05,643
See the folks for a day or two.

948
01:43:11,553 --> 01:43:14,750
There's somethin' I been
meanin' to tell you, bud.

949
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:22,353
Well, it's likely November before
I can come out here again.

950
01:43:25,767 --> 01:43:30,000
After we ship stock and before
winter feedin' starts again.

951
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:35,137
November.

952
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:41,945
What in the hell ever happened
to August?

953
01:43:42,851 --> 01:43:43,841
Well...

954
01:43:47,022 --> 01:43:48,512
Christ, Ennis.

955
01:43:54,496 --> 01:43:58,660
You know, you had a fucking week to
say some little word about this.

956
01:44:01,169 --> 01:44:03,604
Why is it we're always
in the friggin' cold?

957
01:44:03,672 --> 01:44:06,266
We ought to go south
where it's warm, you know!

958
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:08,332
We ought to go to Mexico.

959
01:44:09,177 --> 01:44:10,372
Mexico?

960
01:44:11,713 --> 01:44:14,205
Hell, Jack, you know me. About
all the travelin' I ever done...

961
01:44:14,282 --> 01:44:17,343
is around a coffee pot,
looking for the handle.

962
01:44:19,788 --> 01:44:22,120
Come on, Jack.
Lighten up on me.

963
01:44:24,226 --> 01:44:26,194
We can hunt in November.

964
01:44:27,028 --> 01:44:28,758
Kill us a nice elk.

965
01:44:31,299 --> 01:44:33,165
I'll try if I can get
Don Wroe's cabin again.

966
01:44:33,235 --> 01:44:35,931
We had a good time that year,
didn't we?

967
01:44:38,573 --> 01:44:41,270
There's never enough time,
never enough.

968
01:44:45,747 --> 01:44:47,477
You know, friend...

969
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:52,076
this is a goddamn bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation.

970
01:44:53,155 --> 01:44:56,784
You used to come away easy.
Now it's like seein' the Pope.

971
01:44:59,761 --> 01:45:01,525
Jack, I got to work.

972
01:45:04,633 --> 01:45:07,534
In them earlier days,
I'd just quit the job.

973
01:45:10,272 --> 01:45:11,603
You...

974
01:45:12,274 --> 01:45:15,539
You forget what it's like
bein' broke all the time.

975
01:45:19,147 --> 01:45:21,445
You ever hear of child support?

976
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,652
I'll tell you this,
I can't quit this one...

977
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:29,714
and I can't get the time off.

978
01:45:33,662 --> 01:45:35,653
It was hard enough
gettin' this time.

979
01:45:35,730 --> 01:45:37,460
The trade-off was August.

980
01:45:41,603 --> 01:45:43,469
Well, you got a better idea?

981
01:45:46,274 --> 01:45:47,674
I did, once.

982
01:45:49,878 --> 01:45:51,368
You did, once.

983
01:45:56,218 --> 01:45:58,743
Well, have you been to Mexico,
Jack Twist?

984
01:46:01,423 --> 01:46:04,950
'Cause I hear what they got
in Mexico for boys like you.

985
01:46:06,695 --> 01:46:10,256
Hell, yes, I've been to Mexico.
Is that a fucking problem?

986
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:21,742
I'm going to tell you this
one time, Jack fucking Twist.

987
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:23,573
And I ain't foolin'.

988
01:46:24,913 --> 01:46:28,577
What I don't know, all them
things that I don't know...

989
01:46:28,984 --> 01:46:31,885
could get you killed
if I come to know them.

990
01:46:36,057 --> 01:46:37,582
I ain't jokin'.

991
01:46:42,397 --> 01:46:45,059
Yeah, well try this one,
and I'll say it just once.

992
01:46:45,133 --> 01:46:47,830
- Go ahead!
- I'll tell you what.

993
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:49,370
We could have had
a good life together.

994
01:46:49,437 --> 01:46:52,635
Fucking real good life.
Had us a place of our own!

995
01:46:53,675 --> 01:46:55,734
But you didn't want it, Ennis.

996
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:58,609
So what we got now
is Brokeback Mountain!

997
01:47:00,849 --> 01:47:04,148
Everything's built on that! That's
all we got, boy. Fucking all.

998
01:47:04,219 --> 01:47:06,847
So I hope you know that, if you
don't never know the rest!

999
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,186
You count the damn few times...

1000
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,055
that we have been together
in nearly 20 years...

1001
01:47:11,126 --> 01:47:13,253
and you measure the short
fucking leash you keep me on...

1002
01:47:13,328 --> 01:47:15,956
and then you ask me about Mexico
and you tell me you'll kill me...

1003
01:47:16,031 --> 01:47:19,091
for needin' somethin'
I don't hardly never get!

1004
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:24,605
You have no idea
how bad it gets!

1005
01:47:28,143 --> 01:47:31,078
And I'm not you!
I can't make it...

1006
01:47:31,146 --> 01:47:34,673
on a couple of high-altitude
fucks once or twice a year!

1007
01:47:37,252 --> 01:47:39,550
You are too much for me, Ennis.

1008
01:47:40,255 --> 01:47:42,382
You son of a whoreson bitch!

1009
01:47:44,559 --> 01:47:46,789
I wish I knew how to quit you!

1010
01:47:49,431 --> 01:47:51,160
Then why don't you?

1011
01:47:54,102 --> 01:47:56,537
Why don't you just
let me be, huh?

1012
01:47:58,606 --> 01:48:01,599
It's because of you, Jack,
that I'm like this.

1013
01:48:05,246 --> 01:48:06,646
I'm nothin'.

1014
01:48:07,315 --> 01:48:08,715
I'm nowhere.

1015
01:48:13,388 --> 01:48:16,016
- It's okay.
- Get the fuck off me!

1016
01:48:23,098 --> 01:48:25,692
It's all right. It's all right.

1017
01:48:26,768 --> 01:48:28,361
Damn you, Ennis.

1018
01:48:29,704 --> 01:48:32,298
I just can't stand
this any more, Jack.

1019
01:48:42,817 --> 01:48:46,276
Come on now, you're sleepin'
on your feet like a horse.

1020
01:48:48,623 --> 01:48:51,786
My mama used to say that to me
when I was little.

1021
01:48:52,827 --> 01:48:54,523
And sing to me.

1022
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:09,776
I got to go.

1023
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:14,648
See you in the morning.

1024
01:50:09,804 --> 01:50:11,135
Excuse me.

1025
01:50:16,211 --> 01:50:17,269
Hey.

1026
01:50:18,246 --> 01:50:19,736
Ennis Del Mar.

1027
01:50:23,318 --> 01:50:24,842
Where you been?

1028
01:50:26,821 --> 01:50:28,346
Here and there.

1029
01:50:31,025 --> 01:50:34,154
I left word for you
with Steve at the ranch.

1030
01:50:35,063 --> 01:50:38,431
And you must've got those
notes I left at your place.

1031
01:50:42,237 --> 01:50:45,036
Looks like I got the message,
in any case.

1032
01:50:47,275 --> 01:50:48,367
Carl?

1033
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:52,180
Yeah, Carl's nice.

1034
01:50:52,947 --> 01:50:54,438
He even talks.

1035
01:50:57,652 --> 01:50:59,120
Good for you.

1036
01:51:01,489 --> 01:51:02,581
Yeah.

1037
01:51:05,593 --> 01:51:06,993
Good for me.

1038
01:51:13,434 --> 01:51:15,733
I don't get you, Ennis Del Mar.

1039
01:51:21,075 --> 01:51:22,407
I'm sorry.

1040
01:51:30,885 --> 01:51:33,411
I was probably
no fun anyways, was I?

1041
01:51:36,891 --> 01:51:39,827
Ennis, girls don't
fall in love with fun.

1042
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:26,234
Hello.
Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.

1043
01:52:29,544 --> 01:52:31,171
Who? Who is this?

1044
01:52:32,747 --> 01:52:35,546
Ennis Del Mar.
I'm an old buddy of Jack's.

1045
01:52:36,651 --> 01:52:38,744
Jack used to mention you.

1046
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:42,818
You're the fishing buddy or the
hunting buddy, I know that.

1047
01:52:43,891 --> 01:52:45,655
Would have let you know
what happened...

1048
01:52:45,727 --> 01:52:48,252
but I wasn't sure
about your name or address.

1049
01:52:48,329 --> 01:52:51,265
Jack kept his friends'
addresses in his head.

1050
01:52:53,167 --> 01:52:56,103
That's why I'm callin',
to see what happened.

1051
01:52:58,106 --> 01:52:59,630
Oh, yeah.

1052
01:53:02,076 --> 01:53:05,012
Jack was pumpin' up a flat
on the truck...

1053
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:07,843
out on a back road,
when the tire blew up.

1054
01:53:07,982 --> 01:53:10,884
The rim of the tire slammed
into his face...

1055
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:14,988
broke his nose and jaw and knocked
him unconscious on his back.

1056
01:53:16,257 --> 01:53:19,716
By the time somebody come along,
he'd drowned in his own blood.

1057
01:53:20,828 --> 01:53:22,819
He was only 39 years old.

1058
01:53:27,435 --> 01:53:29,870
Hello? Hello?

1059
01:53:31,105 --> 01:53:32,334
Hello.

1060
01:53:35,977 --> 01:53:37,968
Was he buried down there?

1061
01:53:38,713 --> 01:53:40,147
We put a stone up.

1062
01:53:40,615 --> 01:53:42,640
He was cremated,
like he wanted.

1063
01:53:42,717 --> 01:53:46,984
Half his ashes was interred here, the
rest was sent up with his folks.

1064
01:53:48,256 --> 01:53:52,283
He use to say he wanted his ashes
scattered on Brokeback Mountain...

1065
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,761
but I wasn't sure
where that was.

1066
01:53:55,129 --> 01:53:58,895
I thought Brokeback Mountain might
be around where he grew up.

1067
01:53:58,966 --> 01:54:00,264
Knowing Jack...

1068
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:02,599
it might be some
pretend place...

1069
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:05,867
where bluebirds sing
and there's a whiskey spring.

1070
01:54:08,843 --> 01:54:10,277
No, ma'am...

1071
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:14,474
we was herdin' sheep
on Brokeback one summer...

1072
01:54:15,116 --> 01:54:16,515
back in '63.

1073
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,657
Well, he said
it was his favorite place.

1074
01:54:30,031 --> 01:54:33,228
I thought he meant to
get drunk. He drank a lot.

1075
01:54:36,437 --> 01:54:39,304
Is his folks still up
in Lightning Flat?

1076
01:54:39,974 --> 01:54:42,671
They'll be there
till the day they die.

1077
01:54:47,715 --> 01:54:49,684
Thank you for your time.

1078
01:54:50,551 --> 01:54:52,144
I sure am sorry.

1079
01:54:53,388 --> 01:54:55,151
We was good friends.

1080
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:04,560
Get in touch with his folks.

1081
01:55:04,632 --> 01:55:08,432
I suppose they'd appreciate it
if his wishes was carried out.

1082
01:55:10,271 --> 01:55:12,239
About the ashes, I mean.

1083
01:56:13,034 --> 01:56:16,470
Want a cup of coffee, don't you?
Piece of cherry cake?

1084
01:56:16,537 --> 01:56:18,096
Yes, ma'am,
I'll have a cup of coffee...

1085
01:56:18,172 --> 01:56:21,335
but I can't eat no cake
just now. Thank you.

1086
01:56:30,017 --> 01:56:32,179
I feel awful bad about Jack.

1087
01:56:35,022 --> 01:56:36,354
Thank you.

1088
01:56:38,326 --> 01:56:41,125
I can't begin to tell you
how bad I feel.

1089
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:46,032
I knew him a long time.

1090
01:56:48,936 --> 01:56:50,905
I come by to say that...

1091
01:56:51,572 --> 01:56:55,202
if you want me to take his
ashes up there on Brokeback...

1092
01:56:55,943 --> 01:56:58,378
like his wife said
he wanted to...

1093
01:56:59,146 --> 01:57:00,944
then I'll be happy to.

1094
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:05,781
I'll tell you what.

1095
01:57:06,854 --> 01:57:09,255
I know where
Brokeback Mountain is.

1096
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:14,655
Thought he was too goddamn special
to be buried in the family plot.

1097
01:57:18,065 --> 01:57:19,795
Jack used to say...

1098
01:57:20,635 --> 01:57:23,297
"Ennis Del Mar,"
he used to say.

1099
01:57:24,972 --> 01:57:28,238
"I'm gonna bring him up here
one of these days..."

1100
01:57:28,876 --> 01:57:31,812
"and we'll lick this
damn ranch into shape."

1101
01:57:33,247 --> 01:57:35,079
He had some
half-baked notion...

1102
01:57:35,149 --> 01:57:37,743
the two of you was gonna
move up here...

1103
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:39,812
build a cabin...

1104
01:57:40,855 --> 01:57:42,584
help run the place.

1105
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,890
Then, this spring...

1106
01:57:49,497 --> 01:57:52,728
he got another fella
gonna come up here with him...

1107
01:57:54,402 --> 01:57:57,599
build the place,
help run the ranch.

1108
01:57:58,606 --> 01:58:03,043
Some ranch neighbor of his
from down in Texas.

1109
01:58:05,112 --> 01:58:08,412
Gonna split up with his wife
and come back here...

1110
01:58:09,183 --> 01:58:10,548
so he says.

1111
01:58:12,386 --> 01:58:14,719
But, like most of
Jack's ideas...

1112
01:58:16,557 --> 01:58:18,287
never come to pass.

1113
01:58:21,429 --> 01:58:25,297
I kept his room
like it was when he was a boy.

1114
01:58:26,701 --> 01:58:28,828
I think he appreciated that.

1115
01:58:33,374 --> 01:58:36,571
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.

1116
01:58:42,249 --> 01:58:44,548
Yeah, I'd like that. Thank you.

1117
02:01:45,733 --> 02:01:47,326
Tell you what.

1118
02:01:49,837 --> 02:01:53,569
We got a family plot.
He's goin' in it.

1119
02:01:56,243 --> 02:01:57,506
Yes, sir.

1120
02:02:00,114 --> 02:02:02,412
You come back and see us again.

1121
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:18,221
Thank you, ma'am.

1122
02:03:16,023 --> 02:03:18,685
- Hey there, Junior.
- Hey, Daddy.

1123
02:03:27,534 --> 02:03:28,832
Come here.

1124
02:03:31,639 --> 02:03:33,106
Like the car?

1125
02:03:33,574 --> 02:03:36,373
- Yeah. Is it yours?
- It's Kurt's.

1126
02:03:37,111 --> 02:03:40,205
- I thought you were seein' Troy.
- Troy?

1127
02:03:40,781 --> 02:03:43,011
Daddy, that was two years ago.

1128
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:46,750
Troy still playing baseball?

1129
02:03:47,121 --> 02:03:50,318
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm seein' Kurt now.

1130
02:03:50,724 --> 02:03:53,887
- Well, what does Kurt do?
- Works out in the oil fields.

1131
02:03:55,663 --> 02:03:58,996
- So he's a roughneck?
- Yeah.

1132
02:03:59,833 --> 02:04:03,668
I guess you're 10, you can do whatever you want.
Isn't that right?

1133
02:04:03,737 --> 02:04:05,034
Sure.

1134
02:04:13,647 --> 02:04:16,708
- Daddy, you need more furniture.
- Yeah, well...

1135
02:04:17,351 --> 02:04:20,184
if you got nothin',
you don't need nothin'.

1136
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:26,426
So, what's the occasion?

1137
02:04:30,864 --> 02:04:32,355
Me and Kurt...

1138
02:04:33,667 --> 02:04:35,533
we're getting married.

1139
02:04:38,305 --> 02:04:39,705
Well...

1140
02:04:40,507 --> 02:04:43,033
So how long have you
known this guy for?

1141
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:44,678
About a year.

1142
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:50,048
Our wedding will be June 5,
at the Methodist church.

1143
02:04:50,351 --> 02:04:54,151
Jenny will be singing and Monroe
is gonna cater the reception.

1144
02:05:00,627 --> 02:05:02,619
Now this Kurt fella...

1145
02:05:04,965 --> 02:05:06,433
he loves you?

1146
02:05:09,203 --> 02:05:10,796
Yeah, Daddy.

1147
02:05:12,072 --> 02:05:13,472
He loves me.

1148
02:05:21,515 --> 02:05:23,540
Was hopin' you'd be there.

1149
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:27,446
Yeah.

1150
02:05:30,724 --> 02:05:35,218
I think I'm supposed to be on a
roundup down near the Tetons.

1151
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,742
You know what?

1152
02:05:59,086 --> 02:06:02,146
I reckon they can find
themselves a new cowboy.

1153
02:06:03,957 --> 02:06:07,485
My little girl,
getting married.

1154
02:06:21,108 --> 02:06:23,167
To Alma and Kurt.

1155
02:07:43,657 --> 02:07:45,455
Jack, I swear...
