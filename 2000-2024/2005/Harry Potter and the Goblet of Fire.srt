1
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:50,576
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:40,709
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:45,255
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:50,635
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,263
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,723
I only meant...

7
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,851
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,395
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:04,107
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,943
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:11,072
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,284
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:16,703
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:31,927
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:35,764
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:41,269
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,271
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:49,778
Harry.

19
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,197
Harry!

20
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,283
Are you all right?

21
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:58,119
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:01,623
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,041
Last night.

24
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,460
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:06,878
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,545
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:11,048
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:14,552
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:24,061
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,815
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,483
Keep up!

32
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,904
Arthur!

33
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,073
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,619
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:46,458
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,169
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,504
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,339
This way.

39
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:57,428
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,347
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,308
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,605
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:11,692
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,027
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:17,364
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:20,701
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,370
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:24,872
Time to go!

49
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,665
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:30,878
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:32,129
...three!

52
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,307
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:47,060
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:01,699
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:05,245
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,169
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,924
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,596
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,391
Look!

60
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,561
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:37,860
Blimey!

62
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,904
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,447
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:42,949
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:44,784
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,499
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,836
What?

68
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,137
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:05,638
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,308
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:11,311
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:13,980
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,440
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,818
I love magic.

75
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,545
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:42,007
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:43,592
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,552
If it rains...

79
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,055
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:51,225
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:54,686
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:57,022
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:59,316
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,279
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,531
While you can.

86
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,591
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:26,635
Come on!

88
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,847
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:32,849
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:41,400
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:48,864
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,289
Who's that?

93
00:08:57,081 --> 00:09:00,084
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:05,673
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,637
Krum!

96
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,556
Yes!

97
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,190
Good evening!

98
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,736
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:29,989
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:34,368
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:40,416
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,418
Let the match...

103
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,378
...begin!

104
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,678
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,188
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:03,981
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:07,193
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,279
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:11,822
He's an artist.

110
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,158
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,826
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:17,620
Viktor, I do

113
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:20,997
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:23,833
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,752
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,879
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,174
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,679
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:39,182
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:42,018
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,354
Go!

122
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,356
Harry!

123
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,331
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,710
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,883
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,119
Harry!

127
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,832
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,711
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,631
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,467
What is that?

131
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,639
Stupefy!

132
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,140
Stop!

133
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,518
That's my son!

134
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,230
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,690
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,067
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,194
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,405
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,073
What crime?

140
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,742
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

141
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,077
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:10,124
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,501
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,587
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,341
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,176
There!

147
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,679
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,848
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,599
Who?

150
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,809
I don't know.

151
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,646
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,999
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,128
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,800
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,178
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,138
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,683
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,854
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,524
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,531
Thank you.

161
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,368
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,538
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,457
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,668
This is horrible.

165
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,754
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,714
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,676
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,805
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,852
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

170
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,688
I'm fine.

171
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,608
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,779
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,416
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,874
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,049
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:35,952
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:40,373
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,709
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:46,629
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,131
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,716
What is it?

182
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,389
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:56,556 --> 00:17:02,520
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,730
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,358
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:10,695
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:12,989
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:16,617
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,578
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:21,664
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,749
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,919
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:31,549
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:35,761
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:39,891
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:53,988
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:04,207
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:28,313
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,316
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:34,277
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:57,342 --> 00:18:58,927
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,554
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,597
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,941
Albus.

205
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,818
Igor.

206
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:32,127
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:34,838
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:38,550
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,968
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:43,762
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,729
You idiot!

212
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,736
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,240
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:07,036
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:11,540
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:15,920
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:19,965
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,550
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:25,888
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:27,431
To explain all this...

221
00:20:27,598 --> 00:20:31,227
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,520
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:50,663
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:54,667
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,295
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:02,132
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:17,647
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:18,940
Thank you.

229
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,323
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,743
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,669
After due consideration...

232
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:42,714
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:45,842
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,762
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,640
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:55,393
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,314
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,127
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:24,589
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,675
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,929
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:34,265
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:38,228
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:43,358
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,593
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:15,138
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:19,268
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:21,895
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:26,525
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:28,443
Any questions?

251
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,365
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:37,411
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:43,292
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,128
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:49,548
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:53,802
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:56,763
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,392
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,728
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:05,355
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,816
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,986
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:13,447
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:19,327
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:20,703
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,205
Stand.

267
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:27,168
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:31,172
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:33,007
The lmperius Curse.

270
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:36,427
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:39,555
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:42,516
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,484
Hello.

274
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,820
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,951
Engorgio.

276
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:01,994
Imperio!

277
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:08,834
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,676
If she bites...

279
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,719
...she's lethal.

280
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:23,057
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,810
Get off!

282
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,022
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:33,568
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,946
Drown herself?

285
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:52,002
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:56,172
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,592
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

288
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,677
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:04,014
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:08,059
Another, another.

291
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,604
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,314
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,482
Up.

294
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:20,322
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,950
There's the...

296
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,119
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:29,122
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:30,957
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:35,837
The torture curse.

300
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:39,007
Crucio!

301
00:26:51,728 --> 00:26:55,524
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:17,170
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:20,924
No?

304
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,261
Avada Kedavra!

305
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,557
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,852
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,772
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,139
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:14,351
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:17,688
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:20,441
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,778
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:29,116
Neville?

314
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:30,743
Son?

315
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,745
You all right?

316
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:37,082
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,599
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:09,531
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,632
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,468
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,262
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:34,347
Yes!

323
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:38,476
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,688
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:44,023
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,735
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:50,864
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,824
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,450
So?

330
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:59,664
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,834
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:07,255
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,009
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,011
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,349
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:20,685
Yeah!

337
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,479
Yes!

338
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:25,398
Ready?

339
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,862
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,371
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:45,751
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:48,420
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:50,047
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:56,887
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:59,431
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:33,465
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:39,763
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,057
The champion selection.

349
00:32:13,462 --> 00:32:17,300
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:35,651
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:37,820
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:51,375
The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:05,848
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:10,186
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:13,689
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:17,026
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:19,403
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,852
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:55,564
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:02,153
No. No.

361
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:03,947
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:05,907
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:07,826
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:40,525
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:43,612
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:14,975
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:18,145
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:20,314
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:21,649
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,692
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:26,028
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,530
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:27,696 --> 00:35:30,616
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,285
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:33,494 --> 00:35:35,829
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:39,166
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,335
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:44,505
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:47,841
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:51,095
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:55,182
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:58,727
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:03,691
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:07,403
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,489
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,368
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:44,439
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:47,609
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,777
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:53,031
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:55,491
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:55,658 --> 00:36:58,119
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:01,122
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,750
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:07,921
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:12,008
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:15,762
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,932
...let them unfold.

399
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:21,267
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:23,102
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:26,940
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:30,568
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,947
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,699
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,078
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,289
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:43,623 --> 00:37:46,209
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,892
How did you do it?

409
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:06,980
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

410
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:09,065
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

411
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:12,485
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

412
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:15,029
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

413
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:17,114
Okay?

414
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:19,783
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

415
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,495
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

416
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:29,167
I didn't put my name in that cup.

417
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:33,422
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

418
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:37,634
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

419
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:39,678
...and I don't know why.

420
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:41,054
It just did.

421
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,515
Okay?

422
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:54,067
Piss off.

423
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:11,543
What a charismatic quartet.

424
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,504
Hello.

425
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,925
I'm Rita Skeeter.

426
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:21,011
I write for the Daily Prophet.

427
00:39:21,595 --> 00:39:26,308
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

428
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,685
You're the juicy news.

429
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:33,065
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

430
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:36,735
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

431
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:40,113
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

432
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,325
In short, what makes a champion tick?

433
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:48,121
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

434
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:50,790
So who's feeling up to sharing?

435
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:56,712
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

436
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:10,768
This is cozy.

437
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,062
It's a broom cupboard.

438
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:15,731
You should feel right at home, then.

439
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,693
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

440
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,444
No.

441
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:22,780
So tell me, Harry.

442
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:25,867
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

443
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:27,535
I'm 14. Sorry.

444
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:30,663
- About to compete
against three students...

445
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,125
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

446
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,878
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

447
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:39,380
...in your dizziest daydreams.

448
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:41,924
Concerned?

449
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,928
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

450
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,972
Just ignore the quill.

451
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,975
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

452
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:53,728
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

453
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:56,647
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

454
00:40:56,814 --> 00:41:00,067
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

455
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:01,986
No, I didn't enter.

456
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:03,779
Of course you didn't.

457
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,658
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

458
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:11,454
Scratch that last.

459
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:14,957
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

460
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,500
...how do you think they'd feel?

461
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,419
Proud? Or concerned...

462
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:22,423
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

463
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,175
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

464
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:31,264
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

465
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:05,882
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.

466
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:09,344
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

467
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:11,721
...and she's too easily recognized.

468
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:14,766
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

469
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:19,104
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

470
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,064
And make sure you're alone.

471
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:22,732
Sirius.

472
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,401
P. S:

473
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:26,361
The bird bites.

474
00:42:36,705 --> 00:42:38,123
Sirius?

475
00:42:55,015 --> 00:42:56,932
Harry Potter, age 12...

476
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:00,060
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

477
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,813
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

478
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,565
...and choking back tears...

479
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,625
Sirius. How...?

480
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,294
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

481
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:28,422
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

482
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,049
No!

483
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:31,926
I had to ask.

484
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:36,889
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

485
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:39,475
But who was the third man in the room?

486
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:42,144
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

487
00:43:42,978 --> 00:43:44,522
No.

488
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:49,151
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

489
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:50,611
And what was that?

490
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:54,448
He wanted...

491
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,283
...me.

492
00:43:56,825 --> 00:44:01,163
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

493
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,542
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

494
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,627
Yes.

495
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:08,337
It's just a dream.

496
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:10,506
Look, Harry.

497
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:14,176
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

498
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:18,347
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

499
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:19,598
What are you saying?

500
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:24,019
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

501
00:44:24,186 --> 00:44:28,566
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

502
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:31,568
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

503
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:34,112
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

504
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:41,077
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

505
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:43,538
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

506
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:47,709
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

507
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:51,296
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

508
00:44:54,883 --> 00:44:57,302
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

509
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,557
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

510
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:05,143
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

511
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:09,439
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

512
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:13,318
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

513
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,887
Amazing.

514
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:46,559
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

515
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:48,520
Right, sorry.

516
00:45:49,395 --> 00:45:52,398
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

517
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:55,735
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

518
00:45:57,237 --> 00:45:58,947
It's already been through enough people.

519
00:45:59,113 --> 00:46:01,241
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

520
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:05,035
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

521
00:46:05,202 --> 00:46:07,287
What do you want me to say again?

522
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:08,789
Go.

523
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,838
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

524
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:20,092
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

525
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:22,678
Is that right? Well, you...

526
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:23,929
What?

527
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:31,979
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

528
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:37,734
Dean was told by Parvati that...

529
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:41,196
Please don't ask me to say it again.

530
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,031
Hagrid's looking for you.

531
00:46:43,532 --> 00:46:46,618
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

532
00:46:57,171 --> 00:46:59,423
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

533
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,176
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

534
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:03,760
You'll see soon enough.

535
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:06,138
Now pay attention, this is important.

536
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:09,266
What's with the flower?

537
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,769
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

538
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:14,897
As a matter of fact, I have.

539
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:18,275
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

540
00:47:26,783 --> 00:47:28,243
Hagrid?

541
00:47:32,164 --> 00:47:33,999
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

542
00:47:40,588 --> 00:47:44,008
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

543
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:47,887
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

544
00:47:48,054 --> 00:47:50,723
...you had forgotten me.

545
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,850
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

546
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:55,269
What is it you wanted to show me?

547
00:47:57,021 --> 00:48:00,233
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

548
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:02,068
...exhilarated.

549
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:05,488
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

550
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:17,834
Can we get closer?

551
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:27,093
Dragons?

552
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,761
That's the first task?

553
00:48:29,178 --> 00:48:31,138
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

554
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:35,518
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

555
00:48:36,602 --> 00:48:38,104
Oh, crikey!

556
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:40,731
Although, I have to admit...

557
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:43,734
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

558
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:46,654
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

559
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,283
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

560
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:53,953
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

561
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,496
Didn't Ron tell you that?

562
00:48:57,498 --> 00:48:58,916
No, he didn't.

563
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,502
He didn't tell me a thing.

564
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:14,556
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

565
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:18,727
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

566
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:21,563
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

567
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:24,316
Like the badge?

568
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:26,610
Excuse me.

569
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,240
Harry.

570
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:34,784
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

571
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:36,453
Can I have a word?

572
00:49:37,412 --> 00:49:39,289
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

573
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:42,459
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

574
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:47,506
Dragons. That's the first task.

575
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:50,842
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

576
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:53,011
Are you serious?

577
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:56,848
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

578
00:49:57,015 --> 00:49:59,267
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

579
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:00,894
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

580
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:03,563
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

581
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,775
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

582
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:09,361
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

583
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,530
It just happens a fair bit.

584
00:50:11,696 --> 00:50:14,783
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

585
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,826
You're a right foul git, you know that?

586
00:50:16,993 --> 00:50:19,204
- You think so?
- I know so.

587
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:20,705
Anything else?

588
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:24,376
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

589
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:30,382
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

590
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:33,552
My father and I have a bet, you see.

591
00:50:33,718 --> 00:50:36,888
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

592
00:50:39,474 --> 00:50:42,393
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

593
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,688
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

594
00:50:46,689 --> 00:50:50,693
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

595
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,113
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

596
00:50:56,365 --> 00:50:59,243
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

597
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,247
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

598
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:05,166
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

599
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:08,252
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

600
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:13,424
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

601
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:20,973
Stand still! Stand still!

602
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:34,153
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

603
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,280
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

604
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:38,282
Professor!

605
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:42,036
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

606
00:51:42,203 --> 00:51:44,914
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

607
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,876
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

608
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:51,253
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

609
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:56,258
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

610
00:51:57,343 --> 00:51:58,802
Away!

611
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:04,141
You. Come with me.

612
00:52:39,342 --> 00:52:41,427
That's a Foe-Glass.

613
00:52:42,178 --> 00:52:44,264
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

614
00:52:44,722 --> 00:52:49,143
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

615
00:52:53,314 --> 00:52:55,775
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

616
00:52:55,942 --> 00:52:57,986
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

617
00:52:58,236 --> 00:52:59,946
Now...

618
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:04,450
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

619
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:10,665
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

620
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,626
Sit.

621
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:18,715
Listen to me, Potter.

622
00:53:19,716 --> 00:53:20,884
Your pal Diggory?

623
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:25,471
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

624
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:27,932
Miss Delacour?

625
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:31,060
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

626
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:35,148
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

627
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:37,483
...but Karkaroff's is not.

628
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,485
They'll have a strategy.

629
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:43,114
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

630
00:53:47,952 --> 00:53:49,536
Come on, Potter.

631
00:53:49,703 --> 00:53:51,788
What are your strengths?

632
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:54,750
I don't know.

633
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:57,711
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

634
00:53:57,878 --> 00:54:01,924
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

635
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,719
You're allowed a wand.

636
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:13,602
Bets! Place your bets!

637
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:15,938
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

638
00:54:16,104 --> 00:54:19,066
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

639
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:22,027
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

640
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:23,779
Yes, sir?

641
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:26,782
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

642
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:29,284
Your attention, please.

643
00:54:29,493 --> 00:54:32,120
This is a great day for all of us.

644
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:39,795
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

645
00:54:39,962 --> 00:54:42,631
Please keep your seats at all times.

646
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:45,551
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

647
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:49,137
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

648
00:54:49,304 --> 00:54:51,014
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

649
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:54,268
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

650
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:59,982
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

651
00:55:00,148 --> 00:55:01,984
Battle a dragon.

652
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,740
Young love.

653
00:55:09,491 --> 00:55:10,742
How...

654
00:55:13,203 --> 00:55:14,496
...stirring.

655
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:20,335
If everything goes unfortunately today...

656
00:55:20,502 --> 00:55:23,296
...you two may even
make the front page.

657
00:55:23,462 --> 00:55:25,673
You have no business here.

658
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,842
This tent is for champions...

659
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:29,927
...and friends.

660
00:55:32,722 --> 00:55:36,893
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

661
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:42,857
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

662
00:55:43,024 --> 00:55:47,195
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

663
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:50,615
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

664
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,909
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

665
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:55,870
Sorry, I'll just go.

666
00:55:56,037 --> 00:55:57,580
Barty, the bag.

667
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:00,249
Champions, in a circle around me.

668
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,544
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

669
00:56:03,711 --> 00:56:07,632
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

670
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,218
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

671
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:15,973
The Welsh Green.

672
00:56:20,603 --> 00:56:21,896
Mr. Krum.

673
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,817
The Chinese Fireball.

674
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:35,701
The Swedish Short-Snout.

675
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,162
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

676
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:40,581
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

677
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,420
The Hungarian Horntail.

678
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:51,717
These represent four
very real dragons...

679
00:56:51,884 --> 00:56:54,928
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

680
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:57,597
Your objective is simple:

681
00:56:57,764 --> 00:56:59,266
Collect the egg.

682
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:02,435
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

683
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:06,106
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

684
00:57:06,273 --> 00:57:07,607
Any questions?

685
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:11,278
Very well. Good luck, champions.

686
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:14,239
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

687
00:57:22,914 --> 00:57:26,751
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

688
00:57:38,305 --> 00:57:41,683
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

689
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:45,353
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

690
00:57:45,937 --> 00:57:49,024
And now our fourth
and final contestant.

691
00:57:50,984 --> 00:57:54,571
Harry! Harry! Harry!

692
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,598
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

693
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:07,142
Accio Firebolt!

694
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,299
- Yeah!
- Yes!

695
00:59:47,224 --> 00:59:48,642
Oh, my God.

696
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:01,571
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

697
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:35,766
Yes! Yes!

698
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:01,667
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.

699
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:03,794
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

700
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:05,712
- Never!
- Never!

701
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:09,131
Shush!

702
01:03:09,632 --> 01:03:12,301
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

703
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:16,138
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

704
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,475
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

705
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:33,072
What the bloody hell was that?

706
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:39,954
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

707
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:44,167
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

708
01:03:47,336 --> 01:03:51,257
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

709
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:54,385
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

710
01:03:55,511 --> 01:03:57,638
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

711
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:00,057
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.

712
01:04:02,268 --> 01:04:05,521
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

713
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:09,817
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

714
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:11,486
No, no, no, I did.

715
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:14,697
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

716
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:18,910
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

717
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:23,039
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

718
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,043
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

719
01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:29,253
...after you'd figured that out.

720
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:32,298
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

721
01:04:32,965 --> 01:04:34,383
That's completely mental.

722
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,595
Yeah. Isn't it?

723
01:04:37,762 --> 01:04:39,805
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

724
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,100
Boys.

725
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,001
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

726
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:16,258
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

727
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:21,888
Shush.

728
01:05:22,597 --> 01:05:23,932
Look at this!

729
01:05:25,934 --> 01:05:28,436
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

730
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:31,731
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

731
01:05:31,898 --> 01:05:34,651
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

732
01:05:34,818 --> 01:05:37,112
Her latest prey, sources report...

733
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:40,907
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

734
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:45,120
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

735
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:48,456
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

736
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:50,125
Thank you, Nigel.

737
01:05:54,921 --> 01:05:57,757
Not now, Nigel. Later.

738
01:05:59,593 --> 01:06:01,136
Go on.

739
01:06:06,474 --> 01:06:09,227
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

740
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,189
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

741
01:06:21,322 --> 01:06:23,157
Mum sent me a dress.

742
01:06:23,324 --> 01:06:27,161
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

743
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,455
Nose down, Harry.

744
01:06:29,997 --> 01:06:33,876
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

745
01:06:35,669 --> 01:06:37,505
What are you on about?

746
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:39,632
They're not for Ginny.

747
01:06:39,798 --> 01:06:41,133
They're for you.

748
01:06:42,176 --> 01:06:45,930
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

749
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:49,350
The Yule Ball...

750
01:06:49,517 --> 01:06:54,855
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

751
01:06:55,564 --> 01:06:57,650
...since its inception.

752
01:06:58,317 --> 01:07:02,196
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

753
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:04,031
...gather in the Great Hall...

754
01:07:04,198 --> 01:07:08,244
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

755
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:12,039
As representatives of the host school...

756
01:07:12,206 --> 01:07:17,253
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

757
01:07:17,628 --> 01:07:20,256
And I mean this literally, because...

758
01:07:20,422 --> 01:07:24,885
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

759
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:27,221
...a dance.

760
01:07:31,475 --> 01:07:33,269
Silence!

761
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:36,480
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

762
01:07:36,647 --> 01:07:39,275
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

763
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:43,529
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

764
01:07:43,696 --> 01:07:47,907
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

765
01:07:48,616 --> 01:07:50,577
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

766
01:07:50,743 --> 01:07:52,245
Now, to dance...

767
01:07:52,412 --> 01:07:56,124
...is to let the body breathe.

768
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:59,627
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

769
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:02,172
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

770
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:06,342
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

771
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:09,637
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

772
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:12,056
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

773
01:08:12,223 --> 01:08:14,642
Will you join me, please?

774
01:08:19,272 --> 01:08:22,775
Now, place your right hand
on my waist.

775
01:08:22,942 --> 01:08:25,528
- Where?
- My waist.

776
01:08:25,695 --> 01:08:28,239
And extend your arm.

777
01:08:28,698 --> 01:08:30,658
Mr. Filch, if you please.

778
01:08:33,745 --> 01:08:35,747
One, two, three.

779
01:08:35,914 --> 01:08:39,417
One, two, three. One, two, three.

780
01:08:43,129 --> 01:08:45,256
Never gonna let him forget this,
are you?

781
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:46,591
- Never.
- Never.

782
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:50,637
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

783
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:15,662
Why do they have to travel in packs?

784
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:18,456
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

785
01:09:26,338 --> 01:09:29,842
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

786
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:32,261
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

787
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:40,018
I take after my mum.

788
01:09:40,185 --> 01:09:44,148
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

789
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,233
No, not the maternal sort, her.

790
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,987
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

791
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:54,700
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

792
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:57,202
He laughed so hard at that.

793
01:09:59,246 --> 01:10:01,123
Very funny.

794
01:10:07,045 --> 01:10:10,799
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

795
01:10:10,966 --> 01:10:14,011
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

796
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:16,597
But enough of me. What about you?

797
01:10:33,864 --> 01:10:38,952
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

798
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:43,957
Well, us and Neville.

799
01:10:44,124 --> 01:10:46,793
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

800
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:50,881
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

801
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:55,092
Now I'm really depressed.

802
01:11:00,932 --> 01:11:04,352
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

803
01:11:06,437 --> 01:11:08,439
Who you going with, then?

804
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:12,860
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

805
01:11:13,027 --> 01:11:18,324
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

806
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:20,409
To the ball?

807
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:21,994
Yeah, all right.

808
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,291
Oi, Hermione.

809
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:29,126
You're a girl.

810
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:30,628
Very well spotted.

811
01:11:30,795 --> 01:11:32,713
Come with one of us?

812
01:11:37,343 --> 01:11:40,263
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

813
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,931
For a girl, it's just sad.

814
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:45,852
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

815
01:11:52,817 --> 01:11:54,819
And I said yes!

816
01:11:56,654 --> 01:11:58,239
Bloody hell.

817
01:11:58,406 --> 01:12:00,074
She's lying, right?

818
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,450
If you say so.

819
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,496
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

820
01:12:05,663 --> 01:12:07,748
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room...

821
01:12:07,915 --> 01:12:09,625
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

822
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,294
Agreed.

823
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,985
- Cho!
- Harry!

824
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,283
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

825
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,035
Okay, thanks.

826
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,540
Cho?

827
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,043
Yes?

828
01:12:54,419 --> 01:12:56,671
Well, I just wondered if you...

829
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:59,591
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

830
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:03,553
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

831
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:09,392
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

832
01:13:15,398 --> 01:13:16,983
Harry...

833
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:19,986
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

834
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:22,405
And...

835
01:13:23,073 --> 01:13:26,326
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

836
01:13:27,994 --> 01:13:30,497
Okay. Yeah. Great.

837
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:34,584
Fine. No problem.

838
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:36,503
Okay. Good.

839
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:39,506
Harry?

840
01:13:40,131 --> 01:13:41,925
I really am...

841
01:13:42,092 --> 01:13:43,760
...sorry.

842
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,021
It's all right, Ron.

843
01:13:55,188 --> 01:13:58,400
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

844
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,442
What happened to you?

845
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:02,862
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

846
01:14:03,028 --> 01:14:05,531
- What?
- What did she say?

847
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:07,074
No, of course.

848
01:14:08,617 --> 01:14:11,954
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

849
01:14:12,371 --> 01:14:16,792
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

850
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:21,172
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

851
01:14:21,338 --> 01:14:24,758
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

852
01:14:25,968 --> 01:14:29,597
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

853
01:14:29,763 --> 01:14:33,476
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

854
01:14:33,642 --> 01:14:34,894
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

855
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,147
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

856
01:14:39,482 --> 01:14:42,026
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

857
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:43,652
Hey!

858
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:02,463
Bloody hell.

859
01:15:04,673 --> 01:15:06,467
Bloody hell.

860
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,263
Bloody...

861
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:12,640
Oh, bloody...

862
01:15:16,352 --> 01:15:19,063
What are those? What are those?

863
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:22,274
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

864
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:25,361
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

865
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:27,530
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

866
01:15:27,696 --> 01:15:32,617
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

867
01:15:35,036 --> 01:15:38,122
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

868
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:44,712
Murder me, Harry.

869
01:15:46,089 --> 01:15:47,674
Leave it alone!

870
01:15:48,633 --> 01:15:52,053
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

871
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:54,722
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

872
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:58,476
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

873
01:15:58,643 --> 01:16:00,854
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

874
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,109
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

875
01:16:07,068 --> 01:16:08,486
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

876
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:10,488
Don't you look...

877
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,240
...dashing.

878
01:16:12,824 --> 01:16:15,994
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

879
01:16:16,161 --> 01:16:17,996
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

880
01:16:18,163 --> 01:16:21,207
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

881
01:16:21,374 --> 01:16:22,417
- Are the first to dance.

882
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,336
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

883
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:27,714
Well, now you know.

884
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:33,511
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

885
01:16:33,678 --> 01:16:36,014
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

886
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:37,765
Come along this way.

887
01:16:42,604 --> 01:16:44,439
Oh, come on.

888
01:16:45,273 --> 01:16:47,275
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

889
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:50,820
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

890
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:55,450
This way. This way. Come along.

891
01:16:57,118 --> 01:16:59,370
She looks beautiful!

892
01:16:59,537 --> 01:17:01,122
Yeah, she does.

893
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:52,089
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

894
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:55,300
No. Absolutely not.

895
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:01,557
Hi!

896
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,359
Harry, take my waist.

897
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:14,653
- What?
- Now!

898
01:19:21,302 --> 01:19:23,012
Are you ready?

899
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:25,890
Move your body like a hairy troll

900
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:29,185
Learning to rock and roll

901
01:19:29,602 --> 01:19:32,146
Spin around like a crazy elf

902
01:19:32,688 --> 01:19:34,899
Dancing by himself

903
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:38,569
Boogie down like a unicorn

904
01:19:38,736 --> 01:19:41,197
No stopping till the break of dawn

905
01:19:41,364 --> 01:19:44,200
Put your hands up in the air

906
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:47,119
Like an ogre who just don 't care

907
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:50,540
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

908
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,002
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

909
01:19:57,213 --> 01:20:00,633
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

910
01:20:02,552 --> 01:20:04,095
May I have your arm?

911
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:06,973
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

912
01:20:32,914 --> 01:20:34,457
Hot, isn't it?

913
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:38,503
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

914
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:42,340
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

915
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,344
What's got your wand in a knot?

916
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:50,348
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

917
01:20:50,515 --> 01:20:54,102
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

918
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:57,272
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

919
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:00,942
...is international
magical cooperation...

920
01:21:01,526 --> 01:21:02,986
...to make friends.

921
01:21:03,778 --> 01:21:06,948
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

922
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,211
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

923
01:21:19,419 --> 01:21:20,795
No.

924
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,473
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

925
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:35,894
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

926
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:39,731
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

927
01:21:39,898 --> 01:21:42,025
You know the solution then, don't you?

928
01:21:42,192 --> 01:21:44,152
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

929
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:47,446
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

930
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:49,698
And not as a last resort.

931
01:21:49,865 --> 01:21:54,078
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

932
01:21:54,245 --> 01:21:55,538
Harry.

933
01:21:56,038 --> 01:21:57,289
Where have you been?

934
01:21:57,498 --> 01:21:59,959
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

935
01:22:02,837 --> 01:22:06,841
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

936
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:08,884
What's this about?

937
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:16,183
No, don 't let

938
01:22:17,977 --> 01:22:22,273
This magic die

939
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:26,819
The answer's there

940
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:27,212
Let me see it again.

941
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:31,424
Yes, the time is close now.

942
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:37,972
Harry, at last!

943
01:23:39,349 --> 01:23:44,687
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

944
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:56,658
You all right, Harry?

945
01:23:58,117 --> 01:23:59,911
I just got in.

946
01:24:00,495 --> 01:24:01,704
Me.

947
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:16,261
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

948
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:20,598
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

949
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,977
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

950
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:26,980
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

951
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:32,819
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

952
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:39,701
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

953
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:42,412
Mostly, he watches me study.

954
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,290
It's a bit annoying, actually.

955
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:49,419
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

956
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:51,712
What's that supposed to mean?

957
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,340
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

958
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,677
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

959
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,472
And...

960
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,684
...I'm scared for you.

961
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:09,188
You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.

962
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,316
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

963
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,151
Hey, Potter!

964
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,408
- Potter!
- Cedric.

965
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:25,787
How...? How are you?

966
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,248
Spectacular.

967
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,670
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

968
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,131
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

969
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,008
Exactly.

970
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,595
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

971
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:48,101
It's not a bad place for a bath.

972
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:52,397
Just take your egg...

973
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,901
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

974
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,229
I must be out of my mind.

975
01:26:43,447 --> 01:26:45,575
I'm definitely out of my mind.

976
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:51,539
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

977
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:53,624
Myrtle!

978
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,501
Hello, Harry.

979
01:26:56,335 --> 01:26:59,505
Long time no see.

980
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:07,472
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

981
01:27:07,638 --> 01:27:11,058
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

982
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:13,561
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

983
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:15,480
Polyjuice Potion?

984
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:20,318
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

985
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,784
That's what he did.

986
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,287
The other boy...

987
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,790
...the handsome one...

988
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,418
...Cedric.

989
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,424
Well, go on. Open it.

990
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:56,479
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

991
01:27:56,687 --> 01:28:01,316
We cannot sing
Above the ground

992
01:28:01,525 --> 01:28:05,821
An hour long you'll have to look

993
01:28:06,655 --> 01:28:11,284
To recover what we took

994
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:20,961
Myrtle...

995
01:28:22,379 --> 01:28:25,799
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

996
01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:28,343
Very good.

997
01:28:29,261 --> 01:28:33,640
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

998
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:37,894
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

999
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:57,539
Harry, tell me again.

1000
01:28:59,249 --> 01:29:02,085
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

1001
01:29:02,252 --> 01:29:04,754
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1002
01:29:05,755 --> 01:29:08,258
"An hour long you'll have to look."

1003
01:29:08,467 --> 01:29:11,887
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1004
01:29:13,305 --> 01:29:15,182
"Potentially problematic"?

1005
01:29:15,348 --> 01:29:18,602
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1006
01:29:19,144 --> 01:29:23,440
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1007
01:29:23,648 --> 01:29:26,109
Hate to break up the skull session.

1008
01:29:26,318 --> 01:29:28,278
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1009
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,946
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1010
01:29:31,113 --> 01:29:33,782
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1011
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:36,535
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1012
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:38,621
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1013
01:29:38,787 --> 01:29:41,248
Go. Now!

1014
01:29:51,258 --> 01:29:53,052
Longbottom!

1015
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:55,179
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1016
01:30:03,896 --> 01:30:06,106
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1017
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:08,818
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1018
01:30:09,485 --> 01:30:13,781
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1019
01:30:13,948 --> 01:30:17,701
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1020
01:30:18,327 --> 01:30:20,037
...about plants.

1021
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:22,081
Now, if there's...

1022
01:30:22,248 --> 01:30:27,044
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1023
01:30:27,211 --> 01:30:29,672
...then great. But otherwise...

1024
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,634
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1025
01:30:34,927 --> 01:30:37,763
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1026
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,390
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1027
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:41,016
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1028
01:30:41,183 --> 01:30:43,310
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1029
01:30:43,519 --> 01:30:44,979
Don't be so mean.

1030
01:30:45,646 --> 01:30:47,439
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1031
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,610
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1032
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:53,696
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1033
01:30:53,904 --> 01:30:55,364
Most likely?

1034
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:57,783
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1035
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,411
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1036
01:31:00,578 --> 01:31:03,246
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1037
01:31:03,413 --> 01:31:05,373
I just wanted to help.

1038
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:08,626
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1039
01:31:08,835 --> 01:31:10,545
Where are they anyway?

1040
01:31:10,753 --> 01:31:13,756
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1041
01:31:20,805 --> 01:31:23,016
Welcome to the second task.

1042
01:31:23,224 --> 01:31:26,895
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1043
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:28,438
A treasure of sorts.

1044
01:31:28,605 --> 01:31:31,232
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1045
01:31:31,399 --> 01:31:34,068
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1046
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:35,820
In order to win...

1047
01:31:36,029 --> 01:31:39,866
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1048
01:31:40,033 --> 01:31:42,660
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1049
01:31:42,827 --> 01:31:46,414
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1050
01:31:46,623 --> 01:31:50,460
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1051
01:31:51,044 --> 01:31:53,254
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1052
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:22,742
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1053
01:32:24,118 --> 01:32:27,038
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1054
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:30,834
Yeah!

1055
01:32:32,001 --> 01:32:33,628
What?

1056
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:55,334
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1057
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:58,003
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1058
01:33:58,712 --> 01:34:01,799
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1059
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:21,377
But she's my friend too!

1060
01:35:23,004 --> 01:35:24,714
Only one!

1061
01:36:16,097 --> 01:36:17,974
Let's get down below.

1062
01:36:28,026 --> 01:36:30,862
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1063
01:37:28,335 --> 01:37:30,045
Yes!

1064
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:50,232
Ascendio!

1065
01:37:55,488 --> 01:37:57,198
Harry!

1066
01:37:59,492 --> 01:38:00,951
He's all right.

1067
01:38:02,161 --> 01:38:03,621
He's all right. Barty!

1068
01:38:03,788 --> 01:38:07,208
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1069
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:11,212
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1070
01:38:11,962 --> 01:38:13,589
My little sister.

1071
01:38:14,048 --> 01:38:15,591
Thank you.

1072
01:38:16,425 --> 01:38:19,136
And you! You helped.

1073
01:38:19,804 --> 01:38:22,807
Well, yeah, a bit.

1074
01:38:30,022 --> 01:38:31,190
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1075
01:38:31,357 --> 01:38:34,026
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1076
01:38:35,277 --> 01:38:37,154
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

1077
01:38:37,363 --> 01:38:39,406
I finished last, Hermione.

1078
01:38:40,241 --> 01:38:44,370
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1079
01:38:44,537 --> 01:38:47,790
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1080
01:38:47,957 --> 01:38:50,792
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1081
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:55,755
Attention!

1082
01:38:56,256 --> 01:39:00,093
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1083
01:39:00,552 --> 01:39:04,055
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1084
01:39:04,222 --> 01:39:06,891
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1085
01:39:07,058 --> 01:39:12,021
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1086
01:39:12,188 --> 01:39:16,484
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1087
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:18,611
...second place...

1088
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,280
- Second place!
- Well done!

1089
01:39:20,447 --> 01:39:23,116
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1090
01:39:24,367 --> 01:39:25,910
Yes!

1091
01:39:29,414 --> 01:39:31,207
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1092
01:39:31,374 --> 01:39:33,001
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1093
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:35,503
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1094
01:39:35,712 --> 01:39:38,381
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1095
01:39:38,548 --> 01:39:40,175
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1096
01:39:40,383 --> 01:39:41,926
Well done, boy.

1097
01:39:42,093 --> 01:39:45,346
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1098
01:39:45,513 --> 01:39:49,476
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1099
01:39:50,518 --> 01:39:53,938
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1100
01:39:54,147 --> 01:39:56,107
...to lose one's family.

1101
01:39:58,151 --> 01:40:00,278
Never whole again, are we?

1102
01:40:02,572 --> 01:40:04,616
Still, life goes on...

1103
01:40:05,325 --> 01:40:06,951
...and here we stand.

1104
01:40:09,913 --> 01:40:12,582
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1105
01:40:12,749 --> 01:40:14,209
Bartemius!

1106
01:40:14,417 --> 01:40:18,546
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1107
01:40:18,713 --> 01:40:22,132
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1108
01:40:34,394 --> 01:40:36,271
And they say I'm mad.

1109
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:49,243
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1110
01:40:49,451 --> 01:40:52,454
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1111
01:40:52,996 --> 01:40:55,541
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.

1112
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:59,795
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1113
01:40:59,962 --> 01:41:03,298
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1114
01:41:03,465 --> 01:41:05,008
And Harry, of course.

1115
01:41:05,175 --> 01:41:10,556
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1116
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:12,808
Hooray!

1117
01:41:14,226 --> 01:41:16,687
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1118
01:41:16,895 --> 01:41:19,481
Teach us something, please

1119
01:41:29,491 --> 01:41:30,951
Mr. Crouch?

1120
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:41,670
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1121
01:41:41,837 --> 01:41:43,380
I will not.

1122
01:41:43,589 --> 01:41:47,634
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1123
01:41:47,843 --> 01:41:49,219
Then for once show them some!

1124
01:41:49,386 --> 01:41:53,432
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1125
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:56,767
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1126
01:41:56,976 --> 01:41:59,729
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1127
01:41:59,937 --> 01:42:03,608
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1128
01:42:07,945 --> 01:42:09,489
Oh, Harry!

1129
01:42:09,697 --> 01:42:11,991
Harry, how good to see you again.

1130
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:14,285
I can come back later, professor.

1131
01:42:14,494 --> 01:42:17,830
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1132
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:20,541
Minister, after you.

1133
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:23,085
There you are. Your hat.

1134
01:42:23,294 --> 01:42:26,964
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1135
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:30,301
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1136
01:44:01,808 --> 01:44:03,351
Professor?

1137
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,062
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1138
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:20,744
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1139
01:44:20,952 --> 01:44:22,829
...to present evidence to this council.

1140
01:44:23,038 --> 01:44:25,749
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1141
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:29,961
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1142
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:34,716
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1143
01:44:34,925 --> 01:44:36,551
Do you accept these terms?

1144
01:44:37,177 --> 01:44:39,846
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1145
01:44:40,222 --> 01:44:42,682
I have names, sir.

1146
01:44:43,225 --> 01:44:46,812
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1147
01:44:49,523 --> 01:44:51,983
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1148
01:44:52,192 --> 01:44:54,319
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1149
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:57,114
- If that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1150
01:44:57,322 --> 01:45:00,575
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1151
01:45:00,784 --> 01:45:03,160
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1152
01:45:03,327 --> 01:45:04,495
Yeah, the same.

1153
01:45:04,662 --> 01:45:08,332
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1154
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:12,837
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1155
01:45:13,045 --> 01:45:15,005
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1156
01:45:15,172 --> 01:45:19,885
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1157
01:45:20,052 --> 01:45:23,055
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1158
01:45:23,222 --> 01:45:27,143
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1159
01:45:27,351 --> 01:45:30,354
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1160
01:45:30,521 --> 01:45:33,941
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1161
01:45:34,150 --> 01:45:36,360
Silence!

1162
01:45:37,027 --> 01:45:40,448
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1163
01:45:40,614 --> 01:45:42,741
...this session is now concluded.

1164
01:45:42,908 --> 01:45:44,952
Oh, no, no, no.

1165
01:45:45,911 --> 01:45:47,371
I've heard about one more.

1166
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,082
- What's that?
- The name.

1167
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:51,750
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1168
01:45:51,917 --> 01:45:53,961
...this person took part
in the capture...

1169
01:45:54,128 --> 01:45:56,255
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1170
01:45:56,464 --> 01:45:59,967
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1171
01:46:00,134 --> 01:46:02,428
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1172
01:46:02,636 --> 01:46:05,181
Barty Crouch...

1173
01:46:07,892 --> 01:46:08,893
...Junior.

1174
01:46:18,402 --> 01:46:20,112
Hold him down!

1175
01:46:23,741 --> 01:46:27,328
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1176
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:30,623
Hello, Father.

1177
01:46:32,082 --> 01:46:34,126
You are no son of mine.

1178
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:49,933
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1179
01:46:51,309 --> 01:46:52,685
It's a Pensieve.

1180
01:46:52,852 --> 01:46:57,482
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1181
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:01,194
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1182
01:47:01,694 --> 01:47:04,614
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1183
01:47:04,823 --> 01:47:06,366
...some small detail...

1184
01:47:07,826 --> 01:47:09,953
...something I might have overlooked...

1185
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:14,332
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1186
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:18,962
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1187
01:47:20,046 --> 01:47:21,673
It's maddening.

1188
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:25,760
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1189
01:47:26,511 --> 01:47:28,555
What exactly happened to him?

1190
01:47:28,763 --> 01:47:33,560
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1191
01:47:34,227 --> 01:47:37,814
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1192
01:47:39,315 --> 01:47:42,235
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1193
01:47:43,027 --> 01:47:45,155
I had a dream about him.

1194
01:47:47,407 --> 01:47:50,160
It was in the summer, before school.

1195
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:55,373
In the dream, I was in a house.

1196
01:47:55,540 --> 01:48:00,336
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.

1197
01:48:00,503 --> 01:48:04,090
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch 's son.

1198
01:48:04,507 --> 01:48:07,343
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1199
01:48:08,177 --> 01:48:09,803
Always the same one.

1200
01:48:12,848 --> 01:48:15,142
Sir, these dreams...

1201
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:20,564
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1202
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:25,152
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1203
01:48:25,652 --> 01:48:27,613
I think it's best if you simply...

1204
01:48:33,243 --> 01:48:35,037
...cast them away.

1205
01:48:44,296 --> 01:48:48,217
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1206
01:48:56,975 --> 01:48:58,143
Potter!

1207
01:48:58,352 --> 01:49:00,854
What's your hurry?

1208
01:49:05,984 --> 01:49:09,738
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1209
01:49:09,947 --> 01:49:12,157
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1210
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:14,493
Yes, sir.

1211
01:49:15,452 --> 01:49:16,829
Ingenious.

1212
01:49:18,664 --> 01:49:22,584
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1213
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:26,964
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1214
01:49:28,632 --> 01:49:30,592
Nor is this.

1215
01:49:34,805 --> 01:49:36,431
Know what it is?

1216
01:49:37,766 --> 01:49:39,143
Bubble juice, sir?

1217
01:49:39,768 --> 01:49:41,644
Veritaserum.

1218
01:49:42,395 --> 01:49:46,065
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1219
01:49:46,274 --> 01:49:51,404
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1220
01:49:52,113 --> 01:49:55,116
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1221
01:49:55,324 --> 01:50:00,121
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1222
01:50:00,329 --> 01:50:04,709
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1223
01:50:05,877 --> 01:50:11,549
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1224
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:15,636
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1225
01:50:15,803 --> 01:50:18,014
...I'm going to find out why!

1226
01:50:44,832 --> 01:50:46,375
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1227
01:51:05,603 --> 01:51:07,146
Sonorus!

1228
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:16,738
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1229
01:51:16,905 --> 01:51:21,868
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1230
01:51:23,954 --> 01:51:25,747
...and Mr. Potter...

1231
01:51:27,624 --> 01:51:29,334
...are tied for first position...

1232
01:51:29,543 --> 01:51:33,672
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1233
01:51:34,923 --> 01:51:38,343
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1234
01:51:39,302 --> 01:51:42,305
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1235
01:51:46,685 --> 01:51:49,438
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1236
01:51:49,604 --> 01:51:52,524
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1237
01:51:52,691 --> 01:51:57,154
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1238
01:51:57,529 --> 01:52:01,450
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1239
01:52:04,578 --> 01:52:08,874
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1240
01:52:09,082 --> 01:52:12,419
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1241
01:52:12,627 --> 01:52:15,630
You see, people change in the maze.

1242
01:52:15,797 --> 01:52:17,507
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1243
01:52:17,674 --> 01:52:22,471
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1244
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:26,933
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1245
01:52:35,984 --> 01:52:37,444
Good luck.

1246
01:52:37,819 --> 01:52:39,780
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1247
01:52:42,157 --> 01:52:44,701
On the count of three. One...

1248
01:56:12,531 --> 01:56:13,699
Fleur?

1249
01:56:15,409 --> 01:56:16,869
Fleur.

1250
01:56:20,414 --> 01:56:22,207
Periculum!

1251
01:57:00,913 --> 01:57:02,372
Get down!

1252
01:57:02,956 --> 01:57:04,666
Get down!

1253
01:57:05,334 --> 01:57:06,585
Expelliarmus!

1254
01:57:16,178 --> 01:57:19,348
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1255
01:57:19,556 --> 01:57:21,600
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1256
01:57:33,277 --> 01:57:34,904
Yes.

1257
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,593
Harry!

1258
01:57:59,929 --> 01:58:01,556
Harry!

1259
01:58:03,933 --> 01:58:05,309
Harry!

1260
01:58:07,812 --> 01:58:09,355
Harry!

1261
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:13,109
Reducto!

1262
01:58:29,959 --> 01:58:32,420
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1263
01:58:32,837 --> 01:58:37,550
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1264
01:58:37,717 --> 01:58:39,427
For a moment, so did I.

1265
01:58:41,345 --> 01:58:42,513
Some game, huh?

1266
01:58:43,514 --> 01:58:44,891
Some game.

1267
01:58:50,354 --> 01:58:51,981
Go!

1268
01:59:02,157 --> 01:59:05,160
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1269
01:59:05,368 --> 01:59:07,329
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1270
01:59:07,537 --> 01:59:08,705
...three!
...three!

1271
01:59:21,259 --> 01:59:24,096
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1272
01:59:31,228 --> 01:59:32,562
Where are we?

1273
01:59:38,235 --> 01:59:39,861
I've been here before.

1274
01:59:43,532 --> 01:59:45,075
It's a Portkey.

1275
01:59:46,952 --> 01:59:51,164
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1276
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:56,586
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1277
01:59:56,795 --> 01:59:58,755
What are you talking about?

1278
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:06,930
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1279
02:00:14,563 --> 02:00:16,857
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1280
02:00:17,065 --> 02:00:19,818
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1281
02:00:31,121 --> 02:00:32,997
Do it! Now!

1282
02:00:44,967 --> 02:00:47,428
Bone of the father...

1283
02:00:47,636 --> 02:00:50,556
...unwillingly given.

1284
02:00:57,396 --> 02:01:00,399
Flesh of the servant...

1285
02:01:02,485 --> 02:01:05,654
...willingly sacrificed.

1286
02:01:09,742 --> 02:01:13,496
And blood of the enemy...

1287
02:01:19,293 --> 02:01:21,754
...forcibly taken.

1288
02:01:27,843 --> 02:01:30,763
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1289
02:01:31,555 --> 02:01:33,516
...again.

1290
02:02:36,911 --> 02:02:40,248
My wand, Wormtail.

1291
02:02:49,841 --> 02:02:51,801
Hold out your arm.

1292
02:02:51,968 --> 02:02:53,595
Master.

1293
02:02:53,762 --> 02:02:56,347
Thank you, master.

1294
02:02:56,556 --> 02:02:58,016
The other arm, Wormtail.

1295
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,516
Welcome, my friends.

1296
02:03:41,975 --> 02:03:44,728
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1297
02:03:45,354 --> 02:03:50,859
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1298
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:54,738
I confess myself...

1299
02:03:55,197 --> 02:03:56,740
...disappointed.

1300
02:03:57,449 --> 02:03:59,493
Not one of you tried to find me.

1301
02:03:59,701 --> 02:04:03,038
Crabbe! Macnair!

1302
02:04:03,997 --> 02:04:05,332
Goyle!

1303
02:04:07,835 --> 02:04:09,461
Not even you...

1304
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:15,217
...Lucius.

1305
02:04:17,094 --> 02:04:21,890
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1306
02:04:22,099 --> 02:04:25,102
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1307
02:04:25,269 --> 02:04:30,399
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1308
02:04:32,151 --> 02:04:37,739
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1309
02:04:39,783 --> 02:04:42,369
...that is my true mask.

1310
02:04:42,786 --> 02:04:44,329
I returned.

1311
02:04:46,832 --> 02:04:50,669
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1312
02:04:51,879 --> 02:04:57,634
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1313
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:05,142
Thank you, master.

1314
02:05:05,768 --> 02:05:07,478
Thank you.

1315
02:05:10,606 --> 02:05:12,982
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1316
02:05:14,442 --> 02:05:15,902
Harry.

1317
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:18,863
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1318
02:05:19,071 --> 02:05:23,451
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1319
02:05:23,659 --> 02:05:25,036
I'd introduce you...

1320
02:05:25,203 --> 02:05:29,499
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1321
02:05:32,168 --> 02:05:34,837
The boy who lived.

1322
02:05:35,004 --> 02:05:37,924
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1323
02:05:38,091 --> 02:05:42,095
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1324
02:05:42,261 --> 02:05:46,974
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1325
02:05:47,141 --> 02:05:48,601
Yes, shall I?

1326
02:05:49,102 --> 02:05:50,436
It was love.

1327
02:05:50,603 --> 02:05:55,066
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1328
02:05:55,274 --> 02:05:57,819
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1329
02:05:58,277 --> 02:06:00,071
I could not touch him.

1330
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,407
It was old magic.

1331
02:06:03,616 --> 02:06:05,827
Something I should have foreseen.

1332
02:06:06,035 --> 02:06:07,829
But no matter, no matter.

1333
02:06:07,995 --> 02:06:10,206
Things have changed.

1334
02:06:10,957 --> 02:06:14,460
I can touch you...

1335
02:06:15,086 --> 02:06:16,796
...now.

1336
02:06:24,971 --> 02:06:26,305
Yeah.

1337
02:06:32,645 --> 02:06:36,315
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1338
02:06:37,525 --> 02:06:39,152
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1339
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:43,030
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1340
02:06:44,657 --> 02:06:46,950
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1341
02:06:47,117 --> 02:06:49,494
First, we bow to each other.

1342
02:06:49,703 --> 02:06:52,080
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1343
02:06:52,289 --> 02:06:55,459
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1344
02:06:55,667 --> 02:06:57,002
I said, bow.

1345
02:06:58,837 --> 02:07:03,133
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1346
02:07:03,592 --> 02:07:05,469
Crucio!

1347
02:07:07,929 --> 02:07:09,639
Crucio!

1348
02:07:10,724 --> 02:07:12,684
Attaboy, Harry.

1349
02:07:12,851 --> 02:07:14,978
Your parents would be proud.

1350
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:18,690
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1351
02:07:18,857 --> 02:07:20,400
Expelliar...

1352
02:07:23,445 --> 02:07:25,822
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1353
02:07:26,031 --> 02:07:27,991
I'm going to destroy you.

1354
02:07:30,202 --> 02:07:35,791
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1355
02:07:36,416 --> 02:07:38,960
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1356
02:07:39,169 --> 02:07:41,838
...they'll speak only of how you...

1357
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:43,924
...begged for death.

1358
02:07:44,132 --> 02:07:47,886
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1359
02:07:48,428 --> 02:07:50,055
...obliged.

1360
02:07:50,388 --> 02:07:51,848
Get up!

1361
02:07:56,895 --> 02:07:58,855
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1362
02:07:59,022 --> 02:08:01,233
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1363
02:08:01,441 --> 02:08:04,611
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1364
02:08:18,582 --> 02:08:20,292
Have it your way.

1365
02:08:21,377 --> 02:08:23,754
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1366
02:08:41,272 --> 02:08:43,941
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1367
02:08:48,529 --> 02:08:50,239
He's mine!

1368
02:09:23,314 --> 02:09:27,318
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1369
02:09:27,485 --> 02:09:29,528
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1370
02:09:29,695 --> 02:09:31,489
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1371
02:09:32,656 --> 02:09:35,659
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1372
02:09:35,868 --> 02:09:38,412
Take my body back to my father.

1373
02:09:39,455 --> 02:09:40,748
Let go.

1374
02:09:41,248 --> 02:09:43,209
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1375
02:09:44,043 --> 02:09:46,670
Let go! Let go!

1376
02:09:52,425 --> 02:09:53,802
Accio!

1377
02:09:59,516 --> 02:10:01,476
No!

1378
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:15,865
He did it!

1379
02:10:17,075 --> 02:10:18,701
Harry!

1380
02:10:21,538 --> 02:10:22,997
Harry!

1381
02:10:24,207 --> 02:10:27,460
No! No! No, don't!

1382
02:10:27,752 --> 02:10:29,629
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1383
02:10:29,921 --> 02:10:32,465
He's back. He's back.

1384
02:10:32,674 --> 02:10:34,717
Voldemort's back.

1385
02:10:34,884 --> 02:10:37,262
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1386
02:10:37,429 --> 02:10:39,722
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1387
02:10:39,931 --> 02:10:42,684
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1388
02:10:42,892 --> 02:10:45,186
He's home. You both are.

1389
02:10:45,395 --> 02:10:48,982
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1390
02:10:52,068 --> 02:10:55,655
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1391
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:57,740
Let me through.

1392
02:10:57,907 --> 02:10:59,367
Let me through!

1393
02:11:01,327 --> 02:11:02,579
Let me through!

1394
02:11:02,746 --> 02:11:04,122
That's my son!

1395
02:11:05,457 --> 02:11:06,916
That's my boy!

1396
02:11:09,753 --> 02:11:12,422
It's my boy!

1397
02:11:15,258 --> 02:11:18,845
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1398
02:11:19,012 --> 02:11:21,931
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1399
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:24,850
No!

1400
02:11:27,936 --> 02:11:30,314
It's all right, I got you.

1401
02:11:30,481 --> 02:11:33,817
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1402
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:39,615
No!

1403
02:11:40,741 --> 02:11:42,618
No!

1404
02:12:24,993 --> 02:12:26,703
Are you all right, Potter?

1405
02:12:27,287 --> 02:12:29,164
Does it hurt? That?

1406
02:12:29,373 --> 02:12:31,166
Not so much now.

1407
02:12:32,126 --> 02:12:34,169
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1408
02:12:37,339 --> 02:12:39,299
The cup was a Portkey.

1409
02:12:42,052 --> 02:12:43,846
Someone had bewitched it.

1410
02:12:44,179 --> 02:12:46,223
What was it like?

1411
02:12:46,598 --> 02:12:48,225
- What was he like?
- Who?

1412
02:12:48,434 --> 02:12:50,144
The Dark Lord.

1413
02:12:52,521 --> 02:12:55,607
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1414
02:12:56,859 --> 02:12:58,651
I don't know.

1415
02:13:01,529 --> 02:13:04,449
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1416
02:13:07,410 --> 02:13:09,370
...into one of my nightmares.

1417
02:13:28,139 --> 02:13:29,682
Were there others?

1418
02:13:29,891 --> 02:13:32,101
In the graveyard, were there others?

1419
02:13:36,063 --> 02:13:37,440
I...

1420
02:13:38,191 --> 02:13:42,069
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1421
02:13:49,577 --> 02:13:52,830
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1422
02:13:57,251 --> 02:14:00,254
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1423
02:14:00,463 --> 02:14:02,340
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1424
02:14:05,927 --> 02:14:09,597
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1425
02:14:09,764 --> 02:14:12,225
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1426
02:14:13,893 --> 02:14:16,562
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1427
02:14:16,729 --> 02:14:19,899
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1428
02:14:20,108 --> 02:14:21,651
...that led him straight to it?

1429
02:14:30,076 --> 02:14:34,037
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1430
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:38,291
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1431
02:14:38,458 --> 02:14:40,585
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1432
02:14:41,253 --> 02:14:44,756
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1433
02:14:44,923 --> 02:14:46,174
And now the deed is done.

1434
02:14:47,884 --> 02:14:52,180
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1435
02:15:00,730 --> 02:15:04,234
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1436
02:15:05,152 --> 02:15:07,612
...that I have once and for all...

1437
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:12,576
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1438
02:15:12,784 --> 02:15:13,994
Expelliarmus!

1439
02:15:18,749 --> 02:15:20,000
Severus.

1440
02:15:22,502 --> 02:15:23,962
That's it, take it.

1441
02:15:25,964 --> 02:15:29,384
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1442
02:15:29,593 --> 02:15:32,262
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1443
02:15:32,471 --> 02:15:35,557
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1444
02:15:38,602 --> 02:15:40,145
Harry, away from there!

1445
02:16:01,124 --> 02:16:04,460
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1446
02:16:05,419 --> 02:16:07,463
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1447
02:16:09,298 --> 02:16:10,382
Polyjuice Potion.

1448
02:16:10,549 --> 02:16:13,803
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1449
02:16:14,053 --> 02:16:15,930
We'll get you up in a minute.

1450
02:16:50,423 --> 02:16:51,799
Harry!

1451
02:16:55,469 --> 02:16:57,680
Barty Crouch Junior.

1452
02:16:57,930 --> 02:17:00,850
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1453
02:17:03,227 --> 02:17:04,395
Your arm, Harry.

1454
02:17:08,774 --> 02:17:10,985
You know what this means, don't you?

1455
02:17:11,944 --> 02:17:13,279
He's back.

1456
02:17:14,447 --> 02:17:16,574
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1457
02:17:17,533 --> 02:17:19,827
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1458
02:17:20,077 --> 02:17:24,623
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1459
02:17:25,082 --> 02:17:27,543
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1460
02:17:28,127 --> 02:17:30,963
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1461
02:17:50,899 --> 02:17:53,568
Today, we acknowledge...

1462
02:17:54,277 --> 02:17:57,030
...a really terrible loss.

1463
02:17:59,157 --> 02:18:01,910
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1464
02:18:02,077 --> 02:18:04,370
...exceptionally hard-working...

1465
02:18:05,371 --> 02:18:07,665
...infinitely fair-minded...

1466
02:18:08,249 --> 02:18:10,543
...and, most importantly...

1467
02:18:10,835 --> 02:18:15,381
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1468
02:18:16,549 --> 02:18:20,929
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1469
02:18:23,973 --> 02:18:25,517
You see...

1470
02:18:26,351 --> 02:18:28,394
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1471
02:18:29,354 --> 02:18:31,314
...by Lord Voldemort!

1472
02:18:33,233 --> 02:18:36,820
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1473
02:18:37,445 --> 02:18:41,116
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1474
02:18:43,326 --> 02:18:44,953
Now, the pain...

1475
02:18:45,161 --> 02:18:48,832
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1476
02:18:48,998 --> 02:18:50,291
...and reminds us...

1477
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:54,170
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1478
02:18:54,379 --> 02:18:57,799
...our hearts beat as one.

1479
02:18:58,299 --> 02:19:00,343
In light of recent events...

1480
02:19:00,677 --> 02:19:05,557
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1481
02:19:06,474 --> 02:19:11,812
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1482
02:19:12,229 --> 02:19:14,356
You remember that...

1483
02:19:14,982 --> 02:19:17,985
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1484
02:19:18,569 --> 02:19:21,029
...kind and honest...

1485
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:26,076
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1486
02:19:51,351 --> 02:19:53,395
I never liked these curtains.

1487
02:19:53,979 --> 02:19:56,648
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1488
02:19:56,982 --> 02:19:58,776
By accident, of course.

1489
02:20:04,490 --> 02:20:08,869
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1490
02:20:12,289 --> 02:20:13,916
Professor...

1491
02:20:14,166 --> 02:20:17,169
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1492
02:20:17,961 --> 02:20:22,341
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1493
02:20:23,967 --> 02:20:26,261
Priori Incantatem.

1494
02:20:30,432 --> 02:20:33,143
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1495
02:20:33,727 --> 02:20:35,521
They reappeared.

1496
02:20:37,022 --> 02:20:40,776
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1497
02:20:43,362 --> 02:20:45,988
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1498
02:20:46,447 --> 02:20:51,244
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1499
02:20:54,664 --> 02:20:56,290
But remember this:

1500
02:20:56,499 --> 02:20:58,376
You have friends here.

1501
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:02,130
You're not alone.

1502
02:21:22,859 --> 02:21:24,569
Hermione.

1503
02:21:25,027 --> 02:21:26,988
This is for you.

1504
02:21:27,613 --> 02:21:29,824
Write to me. Promise.

1505
02:21:30,908 --> 02:21:32,285
Bye.

1506
02:21:38,541 --> 02:21:40,501
Au revoir, Ron.

1507
02:22:24,419 --> 02:22:26,963
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1508
02:22:27,130 --> 02:22:28,215
- No.
- No.

1509
02:22:28,423 --> 02:22:32,803
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1510
02:22:37,224 --> 02:22:40,060
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1511
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:48,819
Yes.

1512
02:22:53,573 --> 02:22:56,827
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1513
02:22:57,035 --> 02:22:59,579
I won't. You know I won't.

1514
02:23:00,872 --> 02:23:04,626
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
