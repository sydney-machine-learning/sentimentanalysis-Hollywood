1
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,199
Lock on to him, R2.

2
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-

3
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,596
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-

4
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,836
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

5
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,349
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

6
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,154
- Oddball, do you copy?
- <i>Copy, Red Leader.</i>

7
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,430
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

8
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,357
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

9
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,311
Set S-foils in attack position.

10
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,591
This is where the fun begins.

11
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,631
Let them pass between us.

12
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,756
They're all over me.

13
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,758
- <i>Get them off my-</i>
- I'm gonna go help them out.

14
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,111
<i>No. They are doing theirjob</i>
<i>so we can do ours.</i>

15
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,351
Missiles. Pull up.

16
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,794
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

17
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,229
All right, R4. No, no.
Nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,318
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,718
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,751
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,114
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- <i>I see them.</i>

22
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,309
Buzz droids.

23
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,558
R4, be careful. You have a-

24
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,394
Oh, dear.

25
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,198
They're shutting down
all the controls.

26
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,356
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

27
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,550
<i>The mission.</i>
<i>Get to the command ship.</i>

28
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,989
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

29
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,877
In the name of-

30
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,908
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

31
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,719
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

32
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,677
They're all over me. Anakin!

33
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,118
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

34
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,391
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

35
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,590
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

36
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,954
Get him, R2.

37
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,239
Watch out.

38
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,910
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.

39
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,035
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

40
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,077
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

41
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,076
Have you noticed
the shields are still up?

42
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,519
Sorry, Master.

43
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,351
I have a bad feeling about this.

44
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,397
There they are. Get them.

45
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,635
R2, locate the chancellor.

46
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there-

47
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,272
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

48
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,231
I sense Count Dooku.

49
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,874
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

50
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,431
Spring the trap.

51
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,155
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

52
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,077
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

53
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,150
What's the situation, Captain?

54
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,034
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

55
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,311
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

56
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,269
Destroyers.

57
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,879
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

58
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,797
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

59
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,831
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

60
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,110
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

61
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,435
There's more than
one way out of here.

62
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,276
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

63
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,075
R2, activate elevator 31174.

64
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,990
- <i>Come in, R2.</i>
- What that?

65
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,917
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

66
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,316
<i>R2, activate</i>
<i>the elevator number 31174.</i>

67
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,998
Get back to work. That nothin'.

68
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,918
<i>Activate the elevator 31174.</i>

69
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,439
R2-

70
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,237
Always on the move.

71
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,193
<i>R2, switch on the comlink.</i>
<i>R2, can you hear me?</i>

72
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,799
<i>R2?</i>

73
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,593
R2! R2!

74
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

75
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,797
Hands up,Jedi.

76
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,990
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

77
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,908
<i>R2, do you hear me?</i>
<i>R2, we need to be going up, not down.</i>

78
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,794
Hey, you!

79
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,353
That's better.

80
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,875
You stupid little astro droid.

81
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,159
Oh, it's you.

82
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,918
My eyes! My eyes!

83
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,237
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been-

84
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,271
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

85
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,231
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

86
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,157
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

87
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,679
Count Dooku.

88
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,915
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

89
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,592
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

90
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,591
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

91
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,437
Your swords, please.

92
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,870
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

93
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,116
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

94
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,511
I've been looking forward to this.

95
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,677
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

96
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,110
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

97
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,310
Get-

98
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,439
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

99
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,353
You have hate.
You have anger.

100
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,951
But you don't use them.

101
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,109
Good, Anakin. Good.

102
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,434
Kill him.

103
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,359
Kill him now.

104
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,599
I shouldn't.

105
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,395
Do it.

106
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,758
You did well, Anakin.

107
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,914
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

108
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,995
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

109
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,873
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

110
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,878
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

111
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,036
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

112
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,595
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

113
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,716
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

114
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,794
Anakin, there's no time.

115
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,150
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

116
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,957
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

117
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,036
His fate will be the same as ours.

118
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,990
Prepare for attack!

119
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,031
All batteries, fire! Fire!

120
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,511
Elevator's not working.

121
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,634
R2, activate elevator 3224.

122
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,717
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

123
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,236
Magnetize! Magnetize!

124
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,711
Fire the emergency booster engines.

125
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,357
We're levelling out, sir.

126
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,550
Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.

127
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,148
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

128
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,350
- What is that?
- Oops.

129
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,357
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

130
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,629
Too late.Jump!

131
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,870
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

132
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,991
R2, get down here.

133
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,278
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

134
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,632
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

135
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,990
Activate ray shields.

136
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,068
Ray shields.

137
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,953
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

138
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,354
Apparently not.

139
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,317
- I say patience.
- Patience?

140
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,549
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

141
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,274
and then he'll release
the ray shields.

142
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,310
See? No problem.

143
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,073
Don't move.

144
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,117
Do you have a plan B?

145
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,750
Ah, yes.

146
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,871
The negotiator.

147
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,039
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

148
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,275
Excuse me.

149
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,949
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

150
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,119
And-

151
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,149
Anakin Skywalker.

152
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,752
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

153
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,914
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

154
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,673
Jedi scum.

155
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,110
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

156
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,154
Your lightsabres will make
a fine addition to my collection.

157
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,795
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

158
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,875
R2.

159
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,999
Crush them!

160
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,316
Make them suffer!

161
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,792
Come. Now!

162
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,990
Stay at your stations!

163
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,197
Get him! Get him!

164
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,195
Run!

165
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,437
Don't bother with them.

166
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,755
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,160
You lose, General Kenobi.

168
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,996
Get out of here! Run!

169
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,995
Time to abandon ship.

170
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,235
All the escape pods
have been launched.

171
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,272
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?

172
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,994
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

173
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,795
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

174
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,035
Strap yourselves in.

175
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,479
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

176
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,597
We lost something.

177
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,075
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

178
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,033
Now we're really picking up speed.

179
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,078
Eight plus 60.

180
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,349
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

181
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,272
Steady.

182
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,274
Easy, R2.

183
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,918
5000.

184
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,871
Fire ships on the left and the right.

185
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,594
- We'll take you in.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

186
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,515
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

187
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,597
Another happy landing.

188
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,593
Coming, Master?

189
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,956
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

190
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,389
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

191
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,195
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

192
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,312
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

193
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,715
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

194
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,671
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

195
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,152
All because of your training.

196
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,636
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

197
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,991
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

198
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,669
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

199
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,028
Ninth time.

200
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,759
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

201
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,309
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

202
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,193
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

203
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,791
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

204
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,276
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

205
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,518
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

206
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,437
And I assure you...

207
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,109
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

208
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,119
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

209
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,357
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

210
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,313
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

211
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,476
Thank you, Senator Organa.

212
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,994
It couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

213
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,517
Now there I agree with you.

214
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,234
In fact, I could do with
a tune-up myself.

215
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,399
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

216
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,789
I will do everything
I can in the senate.

217
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,511
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

218
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,637
I've missed you, Padmé.

219
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,872
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

220
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,797
I'm all right.

221
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,394
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

222
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,193
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

223
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,517
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

224
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,154
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

225
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,590
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

226
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,870
Anakin, don't say things like that.

227
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,796
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

228
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,956
What's going on?

229
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,030
Something wonderful has happened.

230
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,077
Ani, I'm pregnant.

231
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,993
That's wonderful.

232
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,676
What are we gonna do?

233
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,356
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

234
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,838
This is a happy moment.

235
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,955
The happiest moment of my life.

236
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,112
Yes, Lord Sidious?

237
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,037
<i>General Grievous...</i>

238
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,029
<i>I suggest you move</i>
<i>the separatist leaders to Mustafar.</i>

239
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,072
It will be done, my lord.

240
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,033
<i>The end of the war is near, General.</i>

241
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,598
But the loss of Count Dooku-

242
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,679
<i>His death was a necessary loss.</i>

243
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,910
<i>Soon I will have a new apprentice-</i>

244
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,068
<i>one far younger</i>
<i>and more powerful.</i>

245
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,878
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

246
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,197
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

247
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,117
where we can be safe.

248
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,515
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

249
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,199
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

250
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,751
You are so... beautiful.

251
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,276
It's only because I'm so in love.

252
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,836
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

253
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,717
So love has blinded you?

254
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,036
That's not exactly what I meant.

255
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,516
But it's probably true.

256
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,751
Anakin, help me!

257
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,671
What's bothering you?

258
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,914
Nothing.

259
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,036
I remember when
I gave this to you.

260
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,151
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

261
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,953
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

262
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,952
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

263
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,308
And?

264
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,471
And it was about you.

265
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,189
Tell me.

266
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,317
It was only a dream.

267
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,591
You die in childbirth.

268
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,396
And the baby?

269
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,712
I don't know.

270
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,190
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

271
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,796
This baby will change our lives.

272
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,553
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

273
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,955
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

274
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,911
I know. I know.

275
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,118
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

276
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,991
We don't need his help.

277
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,154
Our baby is a blessing.

278
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,119
Premonitions?

279
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,639
Premonitions.

280
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,836
These visions you have-

281
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,358
They're of pain, suffering.

282
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,039
Death.

283
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,358
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

284
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,719
Someone.

285
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,637
Close to you?

286
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,199
Yes.

287
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,715
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

288
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,958
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

289
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,509
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

290
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,397
Death is a natural part of life.

291
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,991
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

292
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,237
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

293
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,318
Attachment leads to jealousy.

294
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,716
The shadow of greed that is.

295
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,956
What must I do, Master Yoda?

296
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,552
Train yourself to let go...

297
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,956
of everything you fear to lose.

298
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,674
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

299
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,235
I'm sorry. I was held up.

300
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,069
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

301
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,149
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

302
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,077
What's wrong, then?

303
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,116
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

304
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,392
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

305
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,829
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

306
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,715
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

307
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,117
Be careful of what?

308
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,754
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

309
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,950
He would not say.

310
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,470
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

311
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,716
All of this is unusual.

312
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,070
And it's making me feel uneasy.

313
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,357
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

314
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,509
Of course.

315
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,437
I need your help, son.

316
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,471
What do you mean?

317
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,037
I'm depending on you.

318
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,551
For what? I don't understand.

319
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:49,038
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

320
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,239
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

321
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,634
Me?

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,719
A master?

323
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,837
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

324
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,638
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

325
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,116
I think they will.
They need you.

326
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,797
More than you know.

327
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,351
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

328
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,756
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

329
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,399
I understand.

330
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,750
You are on this council...

331
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,348
but we do not grant you
the rank of master.

332
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,389
What?

333
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,513
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

334
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,119
It's unfair.

335
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,112
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

336
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,599
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

337
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,118
Forgive me, Master.

338
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,469
<i>We have surveyed</i>
<i>all systems in the Republic...</i>

339
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,149
<i>but have found no sign</i>
<i>of General Grievous.</i>

340
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,919
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

341
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,998
The outlying systems you must sweep.

342
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,236
We do not have
many ships to spare.

343
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,430
<i>What about the droid attack</i>
<i>on the Wookiees?</i>

344
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,074
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

345
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,476
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

346
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,751
Go I will.

347
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,758
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

348
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,393
It's settled then.

349
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,310
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

350
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,396
May the Force be with us all.

351
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,074
What kind of nonsense is this?

352
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,475
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

353
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,239
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

354
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,079
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honour.

355
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,033
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

356
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,391
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

357
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,115
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

358
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,471
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

359
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,716
But it's what you wanted.

360
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,991
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

361
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,917
That has nothing to do with this.

362
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,838
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

363
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,190
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

364
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,114
And?

365
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,837
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

366
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,075
What situation?

367
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,152
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

368
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,510
They want to know what he's up to.

369
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,791
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

370
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,240
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

371
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,998
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

372
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,429
This assignment
is not to be on record.

373
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,318
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

374
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,318
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

375
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,431
That is why you must help us.

376
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,870
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

377
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,515
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

378
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,517
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

379
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,677
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

380
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,798
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

381
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,632
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

382
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,548
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

383
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,597
The council is asking you.

384
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,068
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

385
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,997
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

386
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,315
I don't think the boy can handle it.

387
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,271
I don't trust him.

388
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,032
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

389
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,275
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

390
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,110
So the prophecy says.

391
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,916
A prophecy that misread
could have been.

392
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,477
He will not let me down.

393
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,431
He never has.

394
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,438
I hope right you are.

395
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,199
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

396
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,992
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

397
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,837
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

398
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,757
What do you mean?

399
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,836
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

400
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,396
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

401
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,556
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

402
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,278
This war represents a failure to listen.

403
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,311
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

404
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,557
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

405
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,114
Don't ask me to do that.

406
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,110
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

407
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,916
- What is it?
- Nothing.

408
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,875
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

409
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,959
Hold me.

410
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,230
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

411
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,920
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

412
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,356
No politics, no plotting, no war.

413
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,560
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

414
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,557
Come closer. I have good news.

415
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,997
Our clone intelligence units...

416
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,032
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

417
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,628
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

418
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,875
At last.

419
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,277
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

420
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,597
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

421
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,995
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

422
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,317
You're the best choice, by far.

423
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,639
Sit down.

424
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,909
Leave us.

425
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,158
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

426
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,077
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

427
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,991
I'm not sure I understand.

428
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,635
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

429
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,991
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

430
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,151
They're planning to betray me.

431
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,115
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.

432
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,111
Search your feelings.

433
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,674
You know, don't you?

434
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,717
I know they don't trust you.

435
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,991
Or the senate.
Or the Republic.

436
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,588
Or democracy, for that matter.

437
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,512
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

438
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,039
Why?

439
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,233
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

440
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,879
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?

441
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,557
I don't know what to say.

442
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,990
Remember back
to your early teachings.

443
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,309
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

444
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,877
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

445
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,036
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

446
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,109
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

447
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,719
including their quest
for greater power.

448
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,078
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

449
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,839
They think inwards-
only about themselves.

450
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,150
And the Jedi don't?

451
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,629
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

452
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,155
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

453
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,959
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

454
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,237
It's a Sith legend.

455
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,640
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...

456
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,154
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...

457
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,033
so powerful and so wise...

458
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,790
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

459
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,957
to create... life.

460
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,472
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

461
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,878
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

462
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,359
from dying.

463
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,109
He could actually...
save people from death?

464
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,272
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

465
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,439
some consider to be unnatural.

466
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,277
What happened to him?

467
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,316
He became so powerful...

468
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,551
the only thing he was afraid of was...

469
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,517
Iosing his power.

470
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,676
Which eventually, of course, he did.

471
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,789
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

472
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,074
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

473
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,832
It's ironic.

474
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,996
He could save others from death...

475
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,071
but not himself.

476
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,514
Is it possible to learn this power?

477
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,236
Not from a Jedi.

478
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,237
<i>All Red units, over here!</i>

479
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,835
<i>Palpatine thinks General Grievous</i>
<i>is on Utapau?</i>

480
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,437
<i>A partial message was intercepted...</i>

481
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,915
<i>in a diplomatic packet</i>
<i>from the chairman of Utapau.</i>

482
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,391
<i>Act on this we must.</i>

483
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,036
<i>The capture of General Grievous</i>
<i>will end this war.</i>

484
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,793
<i>Quickly and decisively</i>
<i>we should proceed.</i>

485
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,719
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

486
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,994
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

487
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,997
not the chancellor.

488
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,830
<i>A master is needed,</i>
<i>with more experience.</i>

489
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,191
<i>I concur.</i>
<i>Master Kenobi should go.</i>

490
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,713
<i>I agree.</i>

491
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,909
<i>Aye.</i>

492
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,519
Aye.

493
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,471
<i>Very well. Council adjourned.</i>

494
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,640
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

495
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,991
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,559
Charge!

497
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,911
<i>Head for cover!</i>

498
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,473
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

499
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,319
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

500
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,509
Master.

501
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,480
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

502
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,195
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

503
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,150
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

504
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,909
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

505
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,508
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

506
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,631
I have taught you
everything I know.

507
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,355
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

508
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,031
But be patient, Anakin.

509
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,917
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

510
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,117
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

511
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,993
Goodbye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

512
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,037
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

513
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,718
On the far side.

514
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,035
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

515
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,436
-Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

516
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,715
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

517
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,792
Save your energy.

518
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,152
I can't.

519
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,952
Don't give up, Padmé.

520
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,677
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

521
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,316
He came by this morning.

522
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,477
What did he want?

523
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,431
He's worried about you.

524
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,990
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

525
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,352
I feel lost.

526
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,472
Lost? What do you mean?

527
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,595
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

528
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,949
They trust you with their lives.

529
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,039
Something's happening.

530
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,230
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

531
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,351
I want more.

532
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,357
And I know I shouldn't.

533
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,277
You expect too much of yourself.

534
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,157
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

535
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,111
From my nightmares.

536
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,071
Is that what's bothering you?

537
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,911
I won't lose you, Padmé.

538
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,711
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

539
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,149
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

540
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,595
Greetings, young Jedi.

541
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,996
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

542
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,951
Unfortunately, the war.

543
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,429
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

544
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,597
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

545
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,430
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

546
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,197
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

547
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,073
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

548
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,796
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

549
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,229
Tell your people to take shelter.

550
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,193
If you have warriors, now is the time.

551
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,719
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

552
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,513
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

553
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,114
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

554
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,634
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

555
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,035
It is a volcanic planet.

556
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,311
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

557
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,237
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

558
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,592
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

559
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,395
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

560
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,274
Your ship is waiting.

561
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,634
Hello there.

562
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,838
General Kenobi.

563
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,114
You are a bold one.

564
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,479
Kill him.

565
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,033
Back away.

566
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,551
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

567
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,079
Your move.

568
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,518
You fool.

569
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,192
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

570
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,835
Attack, Kenobi.

571
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,275
Army or not...

572
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,269
you must realize
you are doomed.

573
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,277
I don't think so.

574
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,992
<i>Cover that corner.</i>

575
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,756
<i>Master Windu, may I interrupt?</i>

576
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,519
<i>General Kenobi has made contact</i>
<i>with General Grievous...</i>

577
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,790
<i>and we have begun our attack.</i>

578
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,558
Thank you, Commander.

579
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,593
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

580
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,870
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

581
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,399
Yes, Master.

582
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,915
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

583
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,155
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

584
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,956
<i>If he does not give up</i>
<i>his emergency powers...</i>

585
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,877
<i>after the destruction of Grievous...</i>

586
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,116
<i>then he should be</i>
<i>removed from office.</i>

587
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,949
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

588
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,877
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

589
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,278
<i>To a dark place this line</i>
<i>of thought will carry us.</i>

590
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,034
<i>Great care we must take.</i>

591
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,999
Chancellor.

592
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,149
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

593
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,794
He has engaged General Grievous.

594
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,117
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

595
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,797
I should be there with him.

596
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,150
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

597
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,236
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

598
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,433
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

599
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,957
I wish I knew.

600
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,629
More and more I get
the feeling that...

601
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,876
I'm being excluded
from the council.

602
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,354
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

603
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,829
They don't trust you, Anakin.

604
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,471
They see your future.

605
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,309
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

606
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,275
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

607
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,199
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

608
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,956
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

609
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,872
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

610
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,473
Even the nature of the dark side.

611
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,630
You know the dark side?

612
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,311
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

613
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,715
one must study all its aspects...

614
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,832
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

615
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,552
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

616
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,195
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.

617
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,831
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

618
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,789
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

619
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,034
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

620
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,630
and you will be able to
save your wife...

621
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,716
from certain death.

622
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,597
What did you say?

623
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,190
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

624
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,910
You're the Sith lord.

625
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,715
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

626
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,195
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

627
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,556
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

628
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,114
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

629
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,515
A life of significance...

630
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,039
of conscience.

631
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,953
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

632
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,275
I know you would.

633
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,029
I can feel your anger.

634
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,720
It gives you focus...

635
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,070
makes you stronger.

636
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,350
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

637
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,038
Of course. You should.

638
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,038
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

639
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,549
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

640
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,955
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

641
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,550
Know the power of the dark side.

642
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,319
Power to save Padmé.

643
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,715
So uncivilized.

644
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,831
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.

645
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,589
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

646
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,517
We're on our way to make sure...

647
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,790
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

648
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,390
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

649
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,556
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

650
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,439
A Sith lord?

651
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,279
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

652
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,278
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

653
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,316
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

654
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,113
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

655
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,636
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

656
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,070
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

657
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,509
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

658
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,790
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

659
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,718
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

660
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,479
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

661
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,636
There is much fear
that clouds your judgement.

662
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,637
- I must go, Master.
- No.

663
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,548
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

664
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,114
But for now, remain here.

665
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,953
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

666
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,354
Yes, Master.

667
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,390
<i>You do know, don't you...</i>

668
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,750
<i>if theJedi destroy me...</i>

669
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,668
<i>any chance of saving her</i>
<i>will be lost.</i>

670
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,192
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

671
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,429
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

672
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,996
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

673
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,951
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

674
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,548
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

675
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,511
The senate will decide your fate.

676
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,315
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

677
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,670
It's treason then.

678
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,990
You are under arrest, my lord.

679
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,198
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

680
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,356
The Jedi are taking over.

681
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,835
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

682
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,076
You have lost.

683
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,631
You will die!

684
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,077
He's a traitor!

685
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,270
He is the traitor!

686
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,313
I have the power
to save the one you love.

687
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,111
You must choose.

688
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,628
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

689
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,194
Don't let him kill me.

690
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,794
I can't hold it any longer.

691
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,071
I can't. I'm weak.

692
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,077
I'm too weak.

693
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,035
Help me. Help me!

694
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,430
I can't hold on any longer.

695
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,996
I am going to end this
once and for all.

696
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,519
You can't.

697
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,517
He must stand trial.

698
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,829
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

699
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,076
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

700
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,350
I'm too weak.

701
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,916
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

702
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,473
He must live.

703
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,914
- Please don't.
- I need him.

704
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,955
Please don't!

705
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,638
Power!

706
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,391
Unlimited power!

707
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,036
What have I done?

708
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,754
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

709
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,514
Become my apprentice.

710
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,839
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

711
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,233
I will do whatever you ask.

712
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,669
Good.

713
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,788
Just help me save Padmé's life.

714
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,955
I can't live without her.

715
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,154
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

716
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,113
but if we work together...

717
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,074
I know we can discover the secret.

718
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,391
I pledge myself...

719
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,837
to your teachings.

720
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,393
Good.

721
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,558
Good.

722
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,712
The Force is strong with you.

723
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,153
A powerful Sith you will become.

724
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,353
Henceforth you shall be known as...

725
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,189
Darth... Vader.

726
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,838
Thank you, my master.

727
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,359
Rise.

728
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,199
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

729
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:21,271
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

730
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,154
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

731
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,034
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

732
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,199
I agree.

733
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,589
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

734
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,280
Every single Jedi...

735
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,517
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

736
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,030
is now an enemy of the Republic.

737
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,917
I understand, Master.

738
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,511
We must move quickly.

739
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,471
The Jedi are relentless.

740
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:58,152
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

741
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,429
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

742
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,392
We will catch them off-balance.

743
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,309
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

744
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,671
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

745
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,911
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

746
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,951
to save Padmé.

747
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,715
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

748
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,798
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

749
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,757
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

750
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,440
go to the Mustafar system.

751
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,677
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

752
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,076
and the other
separatist leaders.

753
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:49,832
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

754
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,678
And...

755
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,669
we shall have... peace.

756
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,917
Sergeant, over here!

757
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,751
Hurry! All of them!

758
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,237
<i>All Red units, let's move it!</i>

759
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,157
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

760
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,391
Commander, contact your troops.

761
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,351
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

762
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,277
Very good, sir.

763
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,436
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

764
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,630
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

765
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,875
Yes, sir.

766
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,799
<i>Commander Cody...</i>

767
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,631
the time has come.

768
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,833
Execute order 66.

769
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,391
Yes, my lord.

770
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,394
Blast him!

771
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,599
Come on!

772
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:59,111
<i>Execute order 66.</i>

773
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,638
It will be done, my lord.

774
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,597
It will be done, my lord.

775
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,235
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

776
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,237
What are we going to do?

777
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,279
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

778
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,358
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

779
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,312
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

780
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,908
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

781
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,114
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

782
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,677
And so it is.

783
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,039
Get him!

784
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,677
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

785
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,278
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

786
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,799
Yes, sir.

787
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,397
Goodbye, Tarfful.

788
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,397
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

789
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,916
Miss you I will.

790
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,670
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

791
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,995
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

792
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,351
Did you find Kenobi?

793
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,311
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

794
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,550
Start loading your men on the ships.

795
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,079
Move it.

796
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,951
Emergency code 913.

797
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,877
I have no contact
on any frequency.

798
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,873
<i>Master Kenobi.</i>

799
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,877
- Repeat.
- <i>Master Kenobi.</i>

800
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,754
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

801
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,517
<i>We havejust rescued</i>
<i>Master Yoda.</i>

802
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,631
<i>It appears this ambush</i>
<i>has happened everywhere.</i>

803
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,796
<i>We're sending you our coordinates.</i>

804
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,037
Hush! Not so loud.

805
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,038
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

806
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,435
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

807
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,357
I came to see if
you and the baby are safe.

808
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,038
What's happening?

809
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,871
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

810
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,397
I can't believe that.

811
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,910
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

812
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,318
What are you gonna do?

813
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,750
I will not betray the Republic.

814
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,511
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

815
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,234
and with the senate
and with you.

816
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,072
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

817
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,791
Many Jedi have been killed.

818
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,639
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

819
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,910
Anakin, I'm afraid.

820
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,756
Have faith, my love.

821
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,075
Everything will soon be set right.

822
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,798
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

823
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,639
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

824
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:39,035
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

825
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,435
Things will be different.
I promise.

826
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,917
Please, wait for me.

827
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,434
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

828
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,431
Take care, my little friend.

829
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,075
Oh, my lady,
is there anything I might do?

830
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,634
No, thank you, 3PO.

831
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,229
I feel so helpless.

832
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,354
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

833
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,914
Heard from no one have we.

834
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,718
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

835
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,637
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

836
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,069
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

837
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,033
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

838
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,997
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

839
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,396
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

840
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,876
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

841
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,595
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

842
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,314
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

843
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,879
I agree.

844
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,436
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

845
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,836
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

846
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,599
<i>You have done well, Viceroy.</i>

847
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:49,272
<i>When my new apprentice</i>
<i>Darth Vader arrives...</i>

848
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,756
<i>he will take care of you.</i>

849
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,915
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

850
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,871
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

851
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,031
<i>Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor</i>
<i>requests your presence...</i>

852
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,037
<i>at a special session of Congress.</i>

853
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,550
- I will be there.
- <i>He'll be expecting you.</i>

854
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,557
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

855
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,638
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

856
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,591
without keeping
the senate intact.

857
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,551
If a special session
of Congress there is...

858
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,831
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

859
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,637
R2, stay with the ship.

860
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,918
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

861
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:19,792
And the Jedi rebellion
has been foiled.

862
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,909
What's happened?

863
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:25,352
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

864
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:30,713
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

865
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,235
Not even the younglings survived.

866
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:54,440
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

867
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,954
By a lightsabre he was.

868
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,039
Who?

869
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,957
Who could have done this?

870
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,277
The attempt on my life...

871
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:26,076
has left me scarred and deformed.

872
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,753
But I assure you.

873
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:34,396
My resolve has never been stronger!

874
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:39,589
Stop!

875
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:57,433
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

876
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,269
the Republic will be reorganized...

877
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:06,633
into the first Galactic Empire!

878
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:13,117
For a safe and secure society.

879
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,116
So this is how liberty dies.

880
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,434
With thunderous applause.

881
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,830
The war is over.

882
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,919
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

883
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:48,191
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

884
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,629
For the clones...

885
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,673
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

886
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,919
Wait. Master.

887
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,630
There is something I must know.

888
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,752
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

889
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,314
I must know the truth, Master.

890
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,631
It can't be.

891
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,557
It can't be.

892
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,559
<i>You have done well,</i>
<i>my new apprentice.</i>

893
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,558
<i>Now, Lord Vader...</i>

894
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:46,036
<i>go and bring peace to the Empire.</i>

895
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,230
I can't watch any more.

896
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,714
Destroy the Sith we must.

897
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,431
Send me to kill the emperor.

898
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,710
I will not kill Anakin.

899
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:03,356
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

900
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,597
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

901
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:12,155
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

902
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,511
The boy you trained, gone he is.

903
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,393
Consumed by Darth Vader.

904
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,398
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

905
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,636
I don't know where to look.

906
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,435
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

907
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,471
When was the last time
you saw him?

908
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:44,391
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

909
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,637
Padmé, I need your help.

910
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,834
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

911
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,999
From himself.

912
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,555
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

913
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,990
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

914
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,470
I have seen
a security hologram... of him...

915
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,678
killing younglings.

916
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,712
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

917
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,635
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

918
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,075
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

919
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,434
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

920
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,473
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

921
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,317
I don't believe you.

922
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,079
I can't.

923
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,110
I must find him.

924
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,390
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

925
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,315
He has become
a very great threat.

926
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,239
I can't.

927
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,231
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

928
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,357
I'm so sorry.

929
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,636
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

930
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,637
The fighting's over.
And this is personal.

931
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,035
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

932
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,630
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

933
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,035
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

934
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,599
Oh, dear.

935
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:46,550
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

936
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,036
<i>The separatists have been</i>
<i>taken care of, my master.</i>

937
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,913
It is finished then.

938
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:26,832
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

939
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,639
<i>Send a message to the ships</i>
<i>of the Trade Federation.</i>

940
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:36,718
<i>All droid units</i>
<i>must shut down immediately.</i>

941
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,437
Very good, my lord.

942
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,271
I saw your ship.

943
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,878
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

944
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,999
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

945
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:49,599
What things?

946
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,078
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

947
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:57,637
That you... killed younglings.

948
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,680
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

949
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,597
He cares about us.

950
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,395
Us?

951
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,919
He knows.

952
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,037
He wants to help you.

953
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,837
Anakin, all I want is your love.

954
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,190
Love won't save you, Padmé.

955
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,392
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

956
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,795
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

957
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,514
I won't lose you
the way I lost my mother.

958
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:31,679
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

959
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,473
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

960
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,637
Come away with me.

961
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,271
Help me raise our child.

962
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,073
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

963
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,954
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away any more.

964
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,149
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

965
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,991
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

966
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,111
I can overthrow him.

967
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,032
And together,
you and I can rule the galaxy...

968
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,469
make things the way
we want them to be.

969
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,471
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

970
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,071
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

971
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,919
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

972
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,036
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

973
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,591
I don't know you any more.

974
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,037
You're breaking my heart.

975
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,553
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

976
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,317
Because of Obi-Wan?

977
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,071
Because of what you've done.

978
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,031
What you plan to do.

979
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,754
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

980
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,678
- I love you.
- Liar!

981
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,915
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

982
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,833
Let her go, Anakin.

983
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,990
Let her go.

984
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,511
You turned her against me!

985
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,150
You have done that yourself.

986
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,790
You will not
take her from me!

987
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:32,595
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

988
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,552
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

989
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,117
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

990
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,037
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

991
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,549
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

992
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,915
I do not fear
the dark side as you do.

993
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,511
I have brought peace...

994
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:01,191
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

995
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,196
Your new empire?

996
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,956
Don't make me kill you.

997
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:12,592
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

998
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,317
If you're not with me...

999
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,997
then you're my enemy.

1000
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,315
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1001
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,557
I will do what I must.

1002
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,515
You will try.

1003
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,834
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1004
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,238
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1005
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,828
Master Yoda.

1006
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,552
You survived.

1007
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,719
Surprised?

1008
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:19,791
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1009
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,876
Now you will experience...

1010
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,278
the full power of the dark side.

1011
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:11,958
I have waited a long time
for this moment...

1012
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:17,029
my little green friend.

1013
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:30,150
At last the Jedi are no more.

1014
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:34,319
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1015
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,670
At an end your rule is.

1016
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,835
And not short enough it was.

1017
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,516
If so powerful you are...

1018
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,119
why leave?

1019
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,474
You will not stop me.

1020
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:02,991
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1021
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:07,272
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1022
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,439
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1023
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,714
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1024
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,513
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1025
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,870
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1026
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,470
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1027
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,750
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1028
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:47,713
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate take-off.

1029
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,709
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1030
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,757
Into exile I must go.

1031
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,431
Failed I have.

1032
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,631
I have failed you, Anakin.

1033
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,557
I have failed you.

1034
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,433
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1035
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,233
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1036
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,874
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1037
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,513
Then you are lost!

1038
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,309
This is the end for you, my master.

1039
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:33,832
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1040
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,960
You underestimate my power.

1041
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,358
Don't try it.

1042
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,197
You were the chosen one!

1043
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,677
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1044
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:15,869
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1045
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:29,310
I hate you!

1046
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,635
You were my brother, Anakin.

1047
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,830
I loved you.

1048
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,998
Master Kenobi.
We have Miss Padmé on board.

1049
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:27,111
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1050
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,959
We should leave this dreadful place.

1051
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,757
Is Anakin all right?

1052
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,637
Your Majesty, this way.

1053
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:57,357
There he is.

1054
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:59,550
He's still alive.

1055
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:04,556
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1056
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,557
Yes, sir. Right away.

1057
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,911
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1058
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,670
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1059
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,149
We'll take her to
the medical centre. Quickly.

1060
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,356
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1061
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:43,552
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1062
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:47,474
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1063
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,556
She has lost the will to live.

1064
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:52,672
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1065
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,313
Babies?

1066
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:56,237
She's carrying twins.

1067
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,079
Luke.

1068
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,359
Oh, Luke.

1069
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:11,150
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1070
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,397
There's good in him.

1071
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,319
I know.

1072
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,436
I know there's... still-

1073
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:43,639
Lord Vader.

1074
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,956
Can you hear me?

1075
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,279
Yes, Master.

1076
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:56,077
Where is Padmé?

1077
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,637
Is she safe?

1078
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:02,631
Is she all right?

1079
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:08,637
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1080
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:12,393
I? I couldn't have.

1081
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,398
She was alive. I felt it!

1082
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:51,430
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1083
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:56,550
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1084
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,036
Split up they should be.

1085
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:03,551
My wife and I will take the girl.

1086
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:07,833
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1087
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:10,110
She will be loved with us.

1088
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,877
And what of the boy?

1089
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:17,156
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1090
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:21,229
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1091
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:29,995
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1092
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:35,196
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1093
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:41,674
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1094
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,188
Training?

1095
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:48,711
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1096
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:53,638
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1097
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,069
Your old master.

1098
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:58,159
Qui-Gon?

1099
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:03,717
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1100
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:07,196
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1101
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,117
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1102
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,037
Treat them well.
Clean them up.

1103
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,957
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1104
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:14,479
What?
