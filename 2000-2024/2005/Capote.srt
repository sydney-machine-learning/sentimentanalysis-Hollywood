1
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,889
Hello?

2
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,261
Nancy?

3
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:10,888
Exactly.

4
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,617
But at least be honest about the facts.

5
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,856
- That's what I'm saying.
- Who's honest?

6
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,394
I'm honest.

7
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,464
I am honest about what I write about.

8
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,057
I'll let you know if it's autobiographical,
or if it's about me, or if it's not.

9
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,435
And I find autobiographical stories
at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.

10
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,840
...say I'm one thing,
but actually you're another thing.

11
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,812
I think being true to who you are
is important.

12
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,919
I'm not saying you need to be
psychoanalytical about the whole mess.

13
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,146
- But don't be afraid.
- Yeah, I... But don't be afraid.

14
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,485
I had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin
the other day.

15
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,185
- How is he?
- He's a lovely man.

16
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,459
And he told me the plot of his new book.

17
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,562
And he said to me, "But I just want to make
sure it's not one of those problem novels."

18
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,097
And I said, "Jimmy...

19
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,174
"your novel's about a Negro homosexual
who's in love with a Jew.

20
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,405
"Wouldn't you call that a problem?"

21
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,581
And he looked at me and he laughed
because he knew I was right.

22
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,380
I'm saying, you know,
if you're gonna write something like that...

23
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,647
at least be honest why you're writing it.

24
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,313
Can't we just be honest?

25
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,217
Well, I don't think
you actually need to be honest.

26
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,353
But don't come asking
some white man from the South...

27
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,728
whether your book
about a black man fucking some Jew...

28
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,630
when they're both of the same sex...

29
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,963
is an issue!

30
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,469
Don't ask me that!

31
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,970
Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.

32
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,133
Everyone's gonna be quite pleased
with that topic.

33
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,368
So how about you, Truman?
Do you admit it?

34
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,639
Well, I'm not nearly that controversial.

35
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,513
I'm not! I'm not! I am not.

36
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,779
I'm not nearly that controversial.

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,285
Oh, come on.

38
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,736
Hi. It's Truman for William Shawn, please.

39
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,376
Have you read the article
about the killings in Kansas...

40
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,949
in the front section of The New York Times?

41
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,849
I think that's what I want to write about.

42
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,089
I want to go tonight.

43
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,606
- I figured you'd missed it.
- I'm sorry.

44
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,150
That's all right. I thought
I was heading to Kansas by myself.

45
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,354
God, I'm glad you agreed to come.

46
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,857
You're the only one I know
with the qualifications...

47
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,894
to be both a research assistant
and a personal bodyguard.

48
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,291
Thank you.

49
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,523
Now I'm nervous.

50
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,655
Yes?

51
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,035
Mr. Truman Capote
and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?

52
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,832
- That's us.
- Where would you like these, sir?

53
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,635
You can put that right there
between the doors.

54
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,073
What all did you bring?

55
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,541
Just a few things.

56
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,138
- Thank you greatly, sir.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,511
You're welcome.

58
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,976
It's an honor to have you with us, sir...

59
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,555
and I hope you won't mind me saying...

60
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,181
but I thought your last book
was even better than the first.

61
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,452
Thank you.

62
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,093
I mean, just when you think
they've gotten as good as they can get.

63
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,495
- Thank you very much.
- Ma'am.

64
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,498
You're pathetic.

65
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,874
- What?
- You paid him to say that.

66
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,845
You paid him to say that.

67
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,083
How did you know?

68
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,486
"Just when you think
they've gotten as good as they can get"?

69
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,216
I thought that was a good line.

70
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,292
- Do you think that was too much?
- Yeah, a bit.

71
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,202
Your keys.

72
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,272
- Sign here, please.
- Thank you.

73
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,351
Alvin Dewey...

74
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,450
Kansas Bureau of Investigation.

75
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:17,918
KBI.

76
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,356
KBI.

77
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,772
Hi. I'm looking for Alvin Dewey.

78
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,850
Hi.

79
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,349
Mr. Dewey.
Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.

80
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,759
- Bergdorf's.
- Sorry?

81
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,621
- The scarf.
- Oh.

82
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,654
- Nice.
- Thank you.

83
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,501
Mr. Dewey, I wonder when we could
arrange an interview, some time to talk.

84
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,902
About what?

85
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,172
Well, we're not looking
for any inside information.

86
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,746
You know, I don't care one way or another
if you catch whoever did this.

87
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,941
I'm writing an article on how
the Clutter killings are affecting the town.

88
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,410
You know, how you all are bearing up.

89
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,089
I care.

90
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,487
- Excuse me?
- I care.

91
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,693
I care a great deal
if we catch whoever did this.

92
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,963
Oh, I see.

93
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,236
- As do a lot of folks around here.
- Oh, of course.

94
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,963
Do you have press credentials?

95
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,470
- What's a New Yorker?
- Magazine.

96
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,539
Magazines don't give out...

97
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,609
You can come to the news conference
with the rest of them.

98
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,211
Sears, Roebuck.

99
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,445
The boy was 16?

100
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,607
He was 15.

101
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,250
Nancy was 16.

102
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,510
And it's her friend that found them?

103
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,986
- Laura Kinney.
- Can you spell that?

104
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,550
I assume you're okay with the Laura part.

105
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,959
K-l-N-N-E-Y.

106
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,026
But, please, leave her be.

107
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,298
There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.
A whole bunch of Mexicans.

108
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,905
Hello, George.

109
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,642
It's good to see you again.

110
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:16,077
I do have an opinion
whether this was the work of one man...

111
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,775
or "a whole bunch," as you said...

112
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,449
but it doesn't matter a whole lot...

113
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:26,115
whether it was Mexicans
or Methodists or Eskimos.

114
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,487
We're gonna find whoever did this.

115
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,496
Now, four good people
from our community are dead.

116
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,256
So let's remember that.

117
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,697
The West Kansas Farm Committee...

118
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,328
is offering a $1,000 reward...

119
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,268
for information leading to an arrest.

120
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,967
Please print that.

121
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,380
And thank you all for coming.

122
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,855
He was foxy with that old man.

123
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,996
This make you miss Alabama?

124
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,605
Not even a little bit.

125
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,104
- You lie.
- I don't lie.

126
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,211
- Good morning.
- Hi.

127
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,412
Can any of you tell me
where I'd find Laura Kinney?

128
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,149
Is that her? With the boy?

129
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,352
Yeah, with Danny Burke.

130
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,519
Danny Burke?

131
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,822
Laura?

132
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,466
Thank you.

133
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,534
Truman.

134
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,612
I'm gonna find out where that girl lives.

135
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,976
Can I do that alone?

136
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,714
All right?

137
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:36,977
Okay.

138
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,646
I think I scared a friend of yours
this morning.

139
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,249
She came looking for you
when I was writing.

140
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,949
- You hate my friends.
- No, I wouldn't say "hate."

141
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,990
Just as long as they don't
knock on my door.

142
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,996
I saw the bodies today.

143
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,402
- Which?
- The Clutters.

144
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,906
I looked inside the coffins.

145
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,103
That's horrifying.

146
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,114
It comforts me.

147
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,443
Something so horrifying...

148
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,185
It's a relief.

149
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,527
Normal life falls away.

150
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,793
But then, I was never much for normal life.

151
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,799
No.

152
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,469
Yeah, people here won't talk to me.

153
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,406
They want someone like you, like Nelle.

154
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,074
Me, they hate.

155
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,903
I can't think of a single quality
I share with Nelle.

156
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,014
- Well...
- Maybe manliness.

157
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,649
- Good morning, Henry.
- Good morning, sir.

158
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,285
Let's go.

159
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,094
Bye.

160
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,368
Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.

161
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,014
Nancy was your best friend?

162
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,186
Yeah, she was my best friend.

163
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,183
How has Danny been?

164
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,115
Pretty shattered.

165
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,828
Nothing terrible
has ever happened to him before.

166
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,062
Danny was the last one at the house
that night.

167
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,101
That's why Mr. Dewey
keeps interviewing him.

168
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,670
They don't think
that he had anything to do with it.

169
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,967
It's just to see
if he remembers anything unusual.

170
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,674
People in town do seem to wonder
if he was involved.

171
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,613
Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.

172
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,482
Oh, it's the hardest
when someone has a notion about you...

173
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,454
and it's impossible
to convince them otherwise.

174
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,791
Ever since I was a child,
folks have thought they had me pegged...

175
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,397
because of the way I...

176
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,698
The way I am.

177
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,434
You know, the way I talk.

178
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,937
And they're always wrong.

179
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,669
You know what I mean?

180
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,568
Yeah.

181
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,783
I wanna show you something.

182
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,595
Maybe this will give you a better picture
of what happened.

183
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,530
- What is this?
- It's your diary.

184
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,871
"Danny here tonight and we watched TV.

185
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,905
"So nice just having him sit with us.

186
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,947
"Left at 11:00.

187
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,682
"P.S. He's the only one I really love."

188
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,121
And that was that.

189
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,267
Did Laura say "shattered"?

190
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:55,033
"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible
has ever happened to him before."

191
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,743
You know I have 94%% recall
of all conversations?

192
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,039
94%%?

193
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,841
I've tested myself.

194
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,351
Well...

195
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,294
how did that happen?

196
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,422
Apparently Detective Foxy's wife
has read fiction.

197
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,961
That's great.

198
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,434
We're in.

199
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,134
- We are in.
- In.

200
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,256
- You came.
- Hi.

201
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,859
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

202
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,060
Get yourselves in here.

203
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,925
Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.

204
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,165
- Hey, little Deweys.
- Hi.

205
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,234
Hi.

206
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,796
Shake it with your wrist.

207
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,969
Use your whole arm.

208
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,309
More.

209
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,774
You think I'm kidding around,
but I'm serious.

210
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,043
Mama would've put in half the bottle.
She had to buy it by the crate.

211
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,846
Alvin's gonna hate this.

212
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,454
I have to stop.

213
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,082
Oh, I cannot believe
you're from New Orleans.

214
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,420
I miss it so much.

215
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:27,089
Well, I only lived there for a short while,
but my mama was born and bred.

216
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,659
You know something?

217
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,703
Alvin pretends he doesn't know who
you are, but the minute you came to town...

218
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,364
- he read your books.
- No!

219
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,841
He had one of his men pick up
Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City...

220
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,412
'cause it's banned in the library here.

221
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,717
And he said, "I feel like you're spiting me."

222
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,248
I said,
"Do you think I took this job to spite you?"

223
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,997
I was writing the script as they were filming,
all that time in Italy...

224
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,491
and I'd work like mad all day long...

225
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,501
and then dash down to the bar
around midnight...

226
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,538
to hand in the next day's scenes.

227
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,836
And Humphrey had just about
moved into the hotel bar...

228
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,034
Humphrey Bogart.

229
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,804
...where he and John...

230
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,004
John Huston.

231
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,409
...had...

232
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,049
They drank every night.

233
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,914
And I mean drank, you know,
like famished water buffaloes.

234
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,647
Well...

235
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,485
I'd only just handed them the final scene
when the bellhop told me I had a phone call.

236
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,387
And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote...

237
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,262
calling to say that my mother had died.

238
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,630
I flew home to New York,
terribly distraught...

239
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,568
but when I got to the apartment...

240
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,772
I could see that Joe
was in even worse shape than I was.

241
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,450
He grabbed my hand and he said to me...

242
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,445
"Talk.

243
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,320
"Talk about anything." You know?

244
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,730
"I mean, any subject in the world.

245
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,460
"Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.

246
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,235
"Just talk...

247
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,304
"so I won't break down."

248
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,173
He couldn't bear to be alone
with his thoughts.

249
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,708
It was too painful.

250
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,088
It's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.

251
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,254
He and Herb Clutter were good friends
from church.

252
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,557
Oh, Marie.

253
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,430
Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.

254
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,359
Why would they put a pillow
under the boy's head just to shoot him?

255
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,373
Why would they tuck Nancy in?

256
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,744
So many of my friends
would love to meet you.

257
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,982
- Oh, that'd be fine.
- You don't have to worry...

258
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,958
'cause I'm not going to write about this
till everything's over.

259
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,619
Well, I'm not worried.

260
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,961
I know what room you're in at the hotel,
and I know where you live in Brooklyn.

261
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,798
You're celebrating.

262
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,776
Well, remember Nelle's manuscript
she sent me in New York?

263
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,676
Yeah. Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird.

264
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,210
- You said it was good.
- And I was right.

265
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,146
She just heard
Lippincott wants to publish it.

266
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,624
Well, Jesus.

267
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,721
Jesus, well, that's terrific.
Tell her congratulations from me.

268
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,959
Congratulations.

269
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,996
- Thank you.
- Jealous.

270
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,398
- Will you be home by Christmas?
- I wanna come home.

271
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,839
I wanna come home. I do. I just...

272
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,502
thought if they catch whoever did this,
who knows what?

273
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,945
- I'll probably be here till next Christmas.
- I'm gonna let you go.

274
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,107
I...

275
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,917
No, don't go.

276
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,779
We'll go away next spring to write.

277
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,719
- Maybe Spain.
- Yeah.

278
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,382
- Okay, I'm gonna let you go.
- Jack...

279
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:53,162
Jack, I promise.
We'll go away this spring to write.

280
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,993
- Maybe Spain.
- Okay.

281
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,998
All right.

282
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,810
My wife worked there, too.

283
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,873
What did she do in the house?

284
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,640
Cleaning. Cooking a little bit.

285
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,209
Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.

286
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,444
"Girdle up. No extra bulges.

287
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,646
"If you're dressed right,
when he gets home...

288
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,587
"the rest of the evening
should be smooth sailing.

289
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,786
"Bon voyage, gals."

290
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,164
I can't believe you got that whole page.
I only read it once.

291
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,357
- I've tested my...
- Tested myself.

292
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,498
- I have 94%%...
- Percent recall.

293
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,438
- Cut that out.
- Cut that out.

294
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,834
Cut that...

295
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,644
Cut that out.

296
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,144
Isn't that something, Alvin?

297
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,011
Oh, it's impressive.

298
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,315
Thank you.

299
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,026
- I'm sorry. He's upset.
- What's he upset about?

300
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,971
They know who did it.

301
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,206
Two men.

302
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,707
You know, they passed through Kansas City
last week writing bad checks.

303
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,938
By the time Alvin's boys got up there,
they were gone.

304
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,445
Skipped out.

305
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,842
Yeah. They don't know where.

306
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,778
No idea.

307
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:59,014
One of them had a cellmate
who gave him up for the $1,000 reward.

308
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,021
Do they know the name of the cellmate?

309
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,488
No. No, I don't know. Alvin knows.

310
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,699
I guess this isn't the appropriate time
to go ask him.

311
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,467
He's beside himself.

312
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,002
Hello?

313
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,275
Alvin, get in here.

314
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,975
- Dad, it's the telephone.
- Not now, Alvin.

315
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,849
God damn it.

316
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,059
Get over here.

317
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,891
- Dad!
- Alvin, not now.

318
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,161
Sit.

319
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,906
Dad? Dad?

320
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,709
You need to call the Chief of Police
in Las Vegas.

321
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,783
- Alvin, what'd you say?
- He said you need to call them immediately.

322
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,180
- Truman Capote.
- Dorothy Sanderson.

323
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,352
I figured you'd be left alone this morning
by that hardworking husband of yours...

324
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,364
so I have breakfast, and I have news,
and I have literature.

325
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,900
My friend, Jack, mailed me
that book you wanted...

326
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,367
and I inscribed it myself.

327
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,170
"To the maiden of the Midwest,
the priestess of the plains...

328
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,836
"the queen of the kitchen,
my first novel. Truman."

329
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,941
- You're too much. Come on in.
- Oh, thank you.

330
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,453
Go into the living room. Have a seat.

331
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,824
Let me get that.
It's been ringing all morning.

332
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,688
Hello?

333
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,603
Truman, I meant in here.

334
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,374
That's the women's cell.

335
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,811
It's hardly ever used,
but they wanted them separate.

336
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,773
Let's sit in the living room.

337
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,594
They put you in the women's cell.

338
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,841
Do you have any aspirin?

339
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,670
My legs.

340
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,473
Truman?

341
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,976
Please.

342
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,051
I'm sorry.

343
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,692
In the matter of the State of Kansas
v. Richard Eugene Hickock...

344
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,704
and Perry Edward Smith...

345
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,271
this court has been informed
by counsel, Mr. Weeks...

346
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,409
that the defendants wish to waive their right
to a preliminary hearing.

347
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,408
His mind is somewhere else.

348
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,580
Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?

349
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,218
Yes, sir.

350
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,554
Why are they doing that?

351
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,091
Mr. Smith.

352
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,930
I ask that the waiver be effectuated.

353
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,136
"Effectuated"?

354
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,470
So noted.

355
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,385
Remove the prisoners.

356
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,599
Was it your choice to waive the hearing?

357
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,076
Do you still need some?

358
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,347
Give me your hand.

359
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,796
I could kill you if you got too close.

360
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,781
Now, would you like some water, or...

361
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,862
Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.

362
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,674
He said we'd curry favor with the judge...

363
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,915
if we waived our rights.

364
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,710
Who did?

365
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,982
The lawyer.

366
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,865
Your picture's undignified.

367
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,330
People recall first impressions.

368
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,775
What's been your first impression?

369
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,675
Hello.

370
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,254
- Mr. Shawn.
- Truman.

371
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,788
I'm writing a book.

372
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,119
It's too much for a single article.

373
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,819
This town, the killers most of all.

374
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,692
You will be stunned by Perry Smith.

375
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,327
Why, what's happening?

376
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,096
Well, not much yet, but I know.
I can sense him.

377
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,297
He's desperately lonely, frightened.

378
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,073
I have a question.

379
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,642
Are you ready?

380
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,608
- Would it matter?
- No.

381
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,978
How much more money can you send me?

382
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,917
And how quickly could you get Dick Avedon
out here to take some pictures?

383
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,351
Who are you smiling at right now?

384
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,587
I'm smiling at you.

385
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,195
You know, Dick's a very famous
fashion photographer.

386
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,700
World-famous.

387
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,269
Am I gonna be in a fashion magazine?

388
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,775
So there's no worry of having a bad picture.

389
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,973
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?

390
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,847
- What's that?
- Who were you closer to...

391
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,978
- your mom or your dad?
- Well, both.

392
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,487
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,755
- Have you talked to them?
- Yeah.

394
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,860
Who'd you talk to first?

395
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,095
Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.

396
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,835
That was good.

397
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,174
Can you show us the tattoo
on your chest then?

398
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,503
Yeah.

399
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,692
Where did Perry get the art set?

400
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,759
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

401
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,499
Yes, sir.

402
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,132
Defendants, rise.

403
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,473
Perry Edward Smith
and Richard Eugene Hickock...

404
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,712
you stand accused of four counts
of the crime of murder in the first degree.

405
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,557
Have you reached a unanimous verdict?

406
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,357
We have, Your Honor.

407
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,060
What is your verdict?

408
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,463
Guilty on all four counts.

409
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,432
Have you unanimously reached a sentence?

410
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,803
We have, Your Honor.

411
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,604
What is the sentence?

412
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,871
Death.

413
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,895
I need to see him before we go.

414
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,831
Perry.

415
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,068
They're going to transfer you
up to Lansing today.

416
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,436
You'll have to make sure
to put me on the visitors list.

417
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,851
Otherwise I can't see you.

418
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,149
I'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.

419
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,889
You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.

420
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,592
Now they took Dick last night.

421
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,233
And I need you to get him
to do the same thing...

422
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,906
and just put me on the visitors list.

423
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,538
And I thought, "Where does the family eat?"
You know?

424
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,076
I mean, does he, like,
reach his hand through the bars...

425
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,010
and have dinner
with everyone around the table?

426
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:48,107
Nelle, kudos on... Kill the Bird, is it?

427
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,016
- That's close. Thank you.
- That's marvelous. Who's your publisher?

428
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,454
- Lippincott.
- Yes. It's a children's book, right?

429
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,753
- Yes.
- No, no. It's about children.

430
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,452
- Yes.
- Yes, I've heard a lot about it.

431
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,528
- Good.
- Congratulations.

432
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,392
- Thank you.
- I didn't even know she wrote.

433
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,363
He's sad and he's shy.

434
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,101
And he's terrified.

435
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,565
They shotgunned the entire family
in the face.

436
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,939
And I thought, at first,
"I'm gonna be scared of these men.

437
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,705
"I'm gonna run, run right home."

438
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,815
Actually, the brother in the family...

439
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,647
Kenyon is his name...

440
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,283
they had placed a pillow under his head...

441
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,858
and then shot him point-blank in the face.

442
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,487
Almost as if
they were putting him to sleep...

443
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,294
and then shot him.

444
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,467
This is the start of a great love affair.

445
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,736
Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.

446
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,707
The book I'm writing will return him
to the realm of humanity.

447
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,479
It's the book I was always meant to write.

448
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:57,211
Well, he hasn't actually
written a word of it yet...

449
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,690
but he says it's the nonfiction book
of the decade...

450
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,117
so...

451
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,018
So...

452
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,958
what have you been doing?

453
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,800
And I'll tell you...

454
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,974
I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week,
talking about movies, art.

455
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:23,076
Finally I had to break it to her that
of the four Matisses hanging on her wall...

456
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,981
two were upside down.

457
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,280
Can I have another, please?

458
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,984
To answer your question,
I'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's...

459
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,182
by blazing a different path.

460
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,453
By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.

461
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,653
The nonfiction novel.

462
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,792
- You have a subject?
- Yes.

463
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,830
On the night of November 14...

464
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,565
two men broke into a quiet farmhouse
in Kansas and murdered an entire family.

465
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,409
Now, why did they do that?

466
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,908
Two worlds exist in this country.

467
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,808
The quiet, conservative life,
and the life of those two men.

468
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,018
The underbelly. The criminally violent.

469
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,620
And those worlds converged
that bloody night.

470
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,919
Now, I spent the past three months...

471
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,050
interviewing everyone in Kansas
touched by that violence.

472
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,493
Now I spent hours talking to the killers...

473
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,292
and I'll spend more.

474
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:18,128
'Cause researching this work
has changed my life.

475
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,595
You know, it's altered my point of view
about almost everything.

476
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,432
Yeah.

477
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,167
And I think those who read it
will be similarly affected.

478
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,297
So you find them a new lawyer.

479
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,528
Well, they're facing execution in six weeks.

480
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,908
You know, they need someone
to argue whether or not that's right.

481
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,546
Okay.

482
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,783
And I'd also like to see them alive.

483
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,145
- Well...
- Yeah.

484
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,878
Yeah, I need to hear their stories.

485
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,325
Well, just be careful what you do
to get what you want.

486
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,031
I'm finding them a lawyer.

487
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,868
- Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.
- No, I'm finding them a lawyer.

488
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,567
There's a difference.

489
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,091
The Warden will see you now.

490
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,863
Well, we do all right by our boys.

491
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,501
Showers once a week. Feed them good.

492
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,538
We'll be feeding Perry Smith
in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.

493
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,437
Try and get the food in through his arm.

494
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,675
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

495
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,785
Well, he hasn't eaten in a month.

496
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,486
It ain't his right to kill himself.

497
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,146
It's the right of the people.

498
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,882
The people of this state.

499
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,256
And that's who I work for, the people.

500
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,463
- No one told me.
- Yeah, he won't eat.

501
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,501
- When can I see him?
- Well, let me see.

502
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,903
How about you coming 3:00,
Thursday afternoon?

503
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,012
No.

504
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,547
That's no good.

505
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,948
I need to see them now.

506
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,520
Then whenever I want, for as long as I want.

507
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,324
Well, that's just not how we do things
around here, Mr. Capote.

508
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,030
Yeah, I understand what a burden...

509
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,793
unlimited visitation might be
on this institution...

510
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,496
and on the people who pay for it.

511
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,007
And I want to be clear...

512
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,243
that I don't expect the citizens
of Leavenworth County...

513
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,675
to have to shoulder that burden.

514
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,815
This is to be dispensed as you see fit.

515
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,999
You know, I didn't know
where to count your boy at first...

516
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,936
him being half-lndian.

517
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,710
But I did him a favor.
I counted him as a white man.

518
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,143
You're a kind and generous man.

519
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,074
Spread your feet.

520
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,954
This way.

521
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,438
- Hey, hey.
- Yeah, hello.

522
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,576
Hey, thanks a lot for your help
with the lawyer.

523
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,010
Oh, that's fine.

524
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:30,248
Wow. You must be really desperate
for a story to come all the way out here.

525
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,484
You want to go see Perry, go ahead.

526
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,216
Thank you.

527
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,525
You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote...

528
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,292
he's just trying to prove
the insanity defense.

529
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,674
It's okay.

530
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,089
It's okay.

531
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,998
It's Truman. It's your friend.

532
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,531
It's okay.

533
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,209
This is before she had us.

534
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,703
Before she started drinking.

535
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,746
Who took care of you as a child?

536
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,881
Orphanage.

537
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,454
Me and Linda.

538
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,748
And that's your sister?

539
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:09,334
You know, we're not so different
as you might think.

540
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:14,134
Yeah, I was abandoned repeatedly
as a child.

541
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,377
My mama would drag me along
to some new town...

542
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,019
so she could take up
with another man she'd met.

543
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,417
Night after night,
she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.

544
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:38,130
Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff
not to let me out no matter what.

545
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,700
And I was terrified.

546
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,142
And I'd scream my head off...

547
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,777
until finally I'd collapse...

548
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,350
on the carpet next to the door
and I'd fall asleep.

549
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,385
Then after years of this...

550
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,395
she just left me...

551
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:12,223
with relatives in Alabama.

552
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,963
Who raised you up?

553
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,702
My aunts.

554
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,246
And that's where I met Nelle.

555
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,179
And she lived next door.

556
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,019
Your mother was Indian?

557
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,587
Cherokee.

558
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,526
So drinking was not a good thing for her.

559
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,733
No tolerance for it.

560
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,310
We're on suicide watch.

561
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,444
That's why they leave the lights on at night.

562
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,647
I hope we're past that now.

563
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,981
I do.

564
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,661
Be careful of Ricardo.

565
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,774
I think he wants you all to himself.

566
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,637
All right.

567
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,938
But he's naturally mendacious.

568
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,605
Not to be trusted.

569
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:36,310
If he had $100,
he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.

570
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,297
Perry, I want to take your notebooks
with me.

571
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,763
I want to read them.

572
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,539
If I leave here without understanding you...

573
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,710
the world will see you as a monster...

574
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,538
always.

575
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,209
I don't want that.

576
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,174
'Cause he trusts me.
I mean, that's why he gave it to me.

577
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,982
And he's given me absolutely everything.

578
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:45,554
And he wants so badly
to be taken seriously...

579
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,257
to be held in some esteem.

580
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,783
Do you?

581
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,188
Do I what?

582
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,728
Do you hold him in esteem, Truman?

583
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,359
Well...

584
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,394
he's a gold mine.

585
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,838
And he's told me his entire life.

586
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,168
His dead mother.

587
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,442
He had a brother and a sister
kill themselves.

588
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,708
Awful.

589
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,345
Did you tell him
your mama did the same thing?

590
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:18,749
See, I can't tell him everything.

591
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,516
We've been talking our heads off
for the past month.

592
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,655
And sometimes...

593
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,560
when I think how good my book can be,
I can hardly breathe.

594
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,537
Anyway, this is what
I wanted to read to you.

595
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,907
"If called upon to make a speech"...

596
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,774
"If called upon to make a speech"?

597
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:47,173
I mean, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

598
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:51,109
A speech, just in case
he's ever recognized for an achievement.

599
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,647
"I can't remember what I was going to say
for the life of me.

600
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,229
"I don't think ever before have so many
people been so directly responsible...

601
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,456
"for my being so very, very glad.

602
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,431
"It's a wonderful moment and a rare one.

603
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,361
"Thank you!"

604
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,030
There's an exclamation point
at the end of that "thank you"...

605
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,039
in case you didn't catch it.

606
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,036
Where'd you go?

607
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,813
I guess it stopped being funny.

608
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:25,148
I never said it was.

609
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,414
Wait, listen to this.

610
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,358
I was 14.

611
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,759
One day I said to her, "Mom's dead."
I could see it.

612
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:38,026
A week later we got the news.
She finally drunk herself...

613
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,465
Found her shivering...

614
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,900
She hit me so many times
with that flashlight...

615
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,005
she broke it.

616
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,039
That night,
I dreamed about that big yellow bird.

617
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,870
Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.

618
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,602
Lifted me to the sky.

619
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,044
Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.

620
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,687
Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.

621
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,556
Hey, you look good. Healthy again.

622
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,299
You know,
I've decided on a title for my book.

623
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,259
I think you'll like it.

624
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,236
It's very masculine.

625
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,672
In Cold Blood.

626
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,339
Isn't that good?

627
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:26,812
And that refers to the crime or the fact
that you're still talking to the criminals?

628
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,752
The former, among other things.

629
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,349
I see.

630
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,656
I wanted to ask...

631
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,730
if you'd let me look
at your investigation notes.

632
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,797
That lawyer you helped find
for your friends...

633
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,635
got them a hearing
at the Kansas Supreme Court...

634
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,073
I heard this morning.

635
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,770
...on the issue of inadequate counsel.

636
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,146
Alvin...

637
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,549
I mean,
do you not want me to look at your notes?

638
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,351
You are permitted to say no.

639
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,796
I'll tell you what.

640
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,671
If those boys get off...

641
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,206
I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.

642
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,843
I have to be in court at 9:00...

643
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,351
but you call Roy Church
and he'll show you what you want to see.

644
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,652
Thank you.

645
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:43,556
It's as much for me as for anyone.

646
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,530
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you so soon.

647
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:51,799
We're gonna be able to use your book
for our case.

648
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,870
You'll write
we never got to raise an insanity plea.

649
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,068
You wrote how terrible the lawyers was.

650
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,373
I haven't written a word yet.

651
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,785
What have you been doing?

652
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,521
Research. Talking to you.

653
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,530
All right.

654
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,031
- I had hoped...
- What are you calling it?

655
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,469
The book?

656
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,879
I have no idea.

657
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:42,944
Perry...

658
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,246
if I'm going to write about you...

659
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:51,026
if I'm going to determine
how to write about you...

660
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,128
we need to talk about...

661
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,424
you know, why you're here.

662
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,270
You know, the murders...

663
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,998
and that night...

664
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,471
at the Clutter house.

665
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,813
Do you worry what I'll think?

666
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,519
Is that it?

667
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,028
Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.

668
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,496
I know a lot of people.

669
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:41,776
Perry, I have invitations
to be in Morocco, Greece...

670
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,938
and I prefer to be here...

671
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,610
with you.

672
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,953
Jack, be patient with me.

673
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,391
I'm just missing this one piece.

674
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,757
Well, how long is that gonna take?

675
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,391
Why don't you just try leaving him alone
for a while?

676
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:07,969
Come to Spain.

677
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,165
You can always visit him later.

678
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,705
I don't know.

679
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,175
Well, I'm off. I'm just...
I've got my own writing to do.

680
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,303
Well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

681
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,676
There's too many people around. I've...

682
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,845
I'll leave the address on the kitchen table.

683
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:29,286
Well, think about what I said,
and join me when you can.

684
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,686
I will.

685
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,452
- I will.
- Okay?

686
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:34,585
Bye.

687
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,920
Hi.

688
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,203
Truman.

689
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,810
We never intended on killing that family.

690
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:30,944
Capote, will you get that straight
in your book, please?

691
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,845
No premeditation.

692
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,022
What are you doing?

693
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,124
I have to fly back East.

694
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:39,652
When?

695
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:43,127
An hour. I miss you already.

696
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,062
Write me every five minutes.

697
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,136
Hey, you know,
we never did intend on killing that family.

698
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,204
Capote?

699
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,567
Capote?

700
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,388
What?

701
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,716
Truman...

702
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,992
I've not been able to tear myself
away from your book.

703
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,055
It's that good.

704
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,897
It's not good, it's astonishing.

705
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,761
- This first half is astonishing.
- Oh, thank you.

706
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,630
When will you be done, do you think?

707
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,534
Yes, I'm already well into the third part.

708
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,865
But...

709
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:03,176
I can't finish that till I convince Perry
to describe the night of the killings to me.

710
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,946
I was planning to visit this fall, see?

711
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,474
Then I think you need to talk to him now.

712
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,077
And we all need to see how this ends
for the final part.

713
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,050
I can't finish the book
till I know what happens.

714
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,529
If Perry and Dick are executed,
it's one thing.

715
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,291
And if not, well...

716
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,160
Truman, you got your ending.

717
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,426
I really don't know.

718
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,002
The Kansas Court denied their appeal.

719
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,401
It came over the wire on Friday.

720
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,973
I mean, you need to talk to Perry now.

721
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,135
He'll be dead by September.

722
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:39,439
I mean, I'm sorry.

723
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,517
I know how much
you've come to care about him.

724
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,253
Right. Yes, right.

725
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,086
So I want to set up a reading for you
in the fall, in New York...

726
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:57,325
and, well, we'll build some interest,
and we'll publish in the fall.

727
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,848
Thank God. There's nothing in the house.

728
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,582
Why aren't you working?

729
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,054
Well, I knew you couldn't be counted on
to stock the kitchen.

730
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,960
What are we going to feed
our famous guest?

731
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,263
Oh, Jesus, I completely forgot.

732
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,834
Plus, I finished my novel yesterday.

733
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:35,969
What?

734
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,649
When was the last time you wrote to him?

735
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,922
I don't know.

736
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,855
What's this?

737
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,798
It's a letter for Truman
I was asked to deliver.

738
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,690
It's from Perry.

739
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,302
Let's have it.

740
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,614
"Dear friend Truman, where are you?

741
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,713
"Read this item in a medical dictionary.

742
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,722
"'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia...

743
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,760
"'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae...

744
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,159
"'by laceration of the trachea.'

745
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,998
"Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.

746
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,668
"Missing you.

747
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,463
"Alone and desirous of your presence.

748
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,337
"Your amigo, Perry."

749
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,912
Mr. Shawn told me
about the court decision yesterday.

750
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:56,010
I was wondering
why you were in such a good mood.

751
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,254
That's a terrible thing to say.

752
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,518
I write him all the time. I've just...

753
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,622
I've been so focused on the book lately.

754
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:26,178
So Jack thinks I'm using Perry...

755
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,007
but he also thinks I fell in love with him
when I was in Kansas.

756
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:34,184
Now, how both of those things can be true
is beyond me.

757
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,319
Thank you.

758
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,519
Well, did you?

759
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,055
Did you fall in love with him?

760
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,262
I don't know how to answer that.

761
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,564
Truman.

762
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:56,077
It's as if Perry and I grew up
in the same house...

763
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,350
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door...

764
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:05,177
while I went out the front.

765
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,449
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

766
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,055
Listen, you be nice to Jack.

767
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,329
Sometimes I think
he's what I like about you best.

768
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,735
I'll see you at the reading in New York.

769
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,072
- 16th.
- 16th.

770
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,738
Adiós.

771
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,230
What was he in jail for?

772
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,061
Well, they said
it was for not paying his taxes...

773
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,336
but really, for being an outsider.

774
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,669
Refusing to go along.

775
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,211
Lowell, you're being moved.

776
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,142
- Why?
- You're going to final holding.

777
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,213
No.

778
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:09,413
Come on, Lowell. Open the door.

779
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,085
Stand up.

780
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,194
- Put your arms behind your back.
- Okay, last chance.

781
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,455
Get up.

782
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,265
Turn around.
Put your arms behind your back.

783
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,486
Now Dick and me, we're next in line.

784
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,755
I'm so sorry I've been away.

785
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,864
It was a long time.

786
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,195
I know.

787
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,200
How's the book coming along?

788
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:10,742
Very slowly.

789
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,180
Will you show it to me?

790
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,745
I've hardly written anything.

791
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,638
Good evening, New Yorkers...

792
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,552
the first offering of any kind...

793
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,848
of Truman Capote's new work,
In Cold Blood.

794
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,340
Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

795
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:20,012
For this evening's program,
I'm going to read some passages...

796
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,913
from the first three parts of my new book.

797
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:33,886
"The village of Holcomb stands on
the high wheat plains of western Kansas...

798
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:38,190
"a lonesome area
that other Kansans call 'out there. '

799
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,933
"Until one morning in mid-November, 1959...

800
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,974
"few Americans, in fact, few Kansans,
had ever heard of Holcomb.

801
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,773
"Like the waters of the Arkansas River...

802
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,245
"like the motorists on the highway...

803
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:56,215
"exceptional happenings
never stopped there.

804
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,899
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentle and prim.

805
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,764
"A voice that, though soft...

806
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,303
"manufactured each sound exactly...

807
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:23,004
"ejected it like a smoke ring
issuing from a parson's mouth.

808
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:33,144
"The four coffins, which quite filled
the small, flower-crowded parlor...

809
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,249
"were to be sealed at the funeral services...

810
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,750
"very understandably...

811
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:42,355
"for the effect was disquieting.

812
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,893
"Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet...

813
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,567
"her brother a bright plaid shirt.

814
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:52,966
"The parents were more sedately attired...

815
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:57,670
"Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe.

816
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:02,373
"And it was this especially
that lent the scene an awful aura...

817
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,277
"the head of each
was completely encased in cotton.

818
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:11,521
"A swollen cocoon twice the size
of an ordinary blown-up balloon.

819
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,859
"And the cotton...

820
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:17,088
"because it had been sprayed
with a glossy substance...

821
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,067
"twinkled like Christmas tree snow.

822
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,067
"One Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers...

823
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,801
"ignorant of the local disaster...

824
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:32,205
"were startled by what they saw
as they crossed the prairies...

825
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,077
"and passed through Holcomb.

826
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,874
"Windows ablaze.

827
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,244
"Almost every window
in almost every house...

828
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,949
"and in the brightly-lit rooms,
fully-clothed people...

829
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,952
"even entire families...

830
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:50,226
"who had sat the whole night wide awake,
watchful, listening.

831
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,160
"Of what were they frightened?

832
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,236
"It might happen again."

833
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,135
Thank you.

834
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,601
And I slipped and I ripped a hole...

835
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,565
from the bottom of my scrotum...

836
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,003
all the way up
to the top of the crack of my ass.

837
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,600
And I sat there.

838
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:38,903
And I didn't know it. All I felt was a...

839
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:42,717
I didn't know it. All I felt
was a cool breeze, you know, between my...

840
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,615
Sorry. If I may...

841
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,358
Yes.

842
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,158
Your portrait of those men was terrifying.

843
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,088
Terrifying.

844
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:00,724
Thank you.

845
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,472
Stop that man! Come back here!

846
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,066
Dad!

847
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,912
Have any of you met my father?

848
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,015
He hasn't spanked me in years.

849
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,384
George didn't come backstage.

850
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,019
He had... He had a...

851
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,129
Something that his wife
had to rush him off to.

852
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:33,860
- But he made a point of...
- Well, I'm still waiting for a call.

853
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:37,095
It was beautiful.
And everybody came. Everybody came.

854
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,833
- Tennessee loved it.
- Of course he loved it.

855
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,368
Should we do more?

856
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,914
No, we just sit and wait
while people talk about it...

857
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:48,107
and we let them do the work.

858
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,110
I mean,
this book is going to change everything.

859
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:56,491
It's gonna change
how people see your writing.

860
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,596
I think it's going to change
how people write.

861
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:09,932
- Are you gonna be finished by October?
- I think so.

862
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,909
You know,
they're scheduled for next month.

863
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,405
To hang.

864
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,138
Yeah.

865
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:24,742
We're gonna commit as many issues
as it takes to publish.

866
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,821
Whatever it takes.

867
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,881
Well, I'm going to Kansas tomorrow...

868
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,524
- and I'll get Perry to talk.
- What's he got to lose?

869
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,099
Sorry, but...

870
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,663
Hey, this may sound strange to you...

871
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:48,666
but I'm going to miss him.

872
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:51,471
You'll be able to finish now.

873
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,328
Need to check your papers, sir.

874
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,072
This is what we've been waiting for.

875
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,940
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.

876
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,672
All thanks to you.

877
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,146
Thank you!

878
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:34,654
They're not gonna corner me now.
Not unless the U.S. Government says so.

879
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,918
Kansas has had it in for me for 10 years.
They can't corner me now.

880
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,627
Hey, Perry, sit down...

881
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,331
for a minute.

882
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,497
I need you to talk to me.

883
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,869
We've got all the time in the world to talk.

884
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,875
I've been thinking about Ricardo.

885
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:00,038
You really need to stop sending him
those trashy books.

886
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,447
I won't even mention the pornography.

887
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:08,416
Now, I realize that Dick probably can't grasp
the literature that you gave me.

888
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,225
And the books you send him only...

889
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,791
They only exacerbate the problem.

890
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,131
They only heighten or intensify it.

891
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,829
Maybe we can get him started on a program.

892
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,528
Perry, I know what "exacerbate" means.

893
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,702
Okay, well, just thinking...

894
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:31,176
There's not a word or a sentence
or a concept that you can illuminate for me.

895
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,407
There is one singular reason
I keep coming here.

896
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,676
- Truman.
- November 14, 1959.

897
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:41,249
Three years ago. Three years.

898
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,159
And that's all I want to hear from you.

899
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,569
Now I asked you not to. Ever.

900
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,773
This is absurd.
Do you know what absurd means?

901
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,250
I'm ready. I have a plane to catch.

902
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,013
I found your sister in Tacoma.

903
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,513
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.

904
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:20,955
Please don't go out there.

905
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,857
Hey, this is my work, Perry. I'm working.

906
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:31,669
And when you want to tell me
what I need to hear, you let me know.

907
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,679
June's dead. Frank shot himself.

908
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,956
Now Perry did what he did.

909
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:55,458
I used to love him. He was my little doll.

910
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,822
He scares me now.

911
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,932
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Ten years ago.

912
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,869
Ten years.

913
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,138
Could I borrow one of these pictures?

914
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,442
Take the whole thing.
I don't want them anymore.

915
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:24,057
Don't be taken in by my brother.
He's got this sensitive side he'll show.

916
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:27,293
You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt...

917
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:31,555
but he'd just as soon kill you
as shake your hand. I believe that.

918
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,498
Hello, handsome.

919
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,675
What's the name of your book?

920
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,792
What's the name of your book?

921
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,489
I don't know what you're talking about.

922
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:48,569
"Truman Capote read last night
before a packed audience...

923
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:54,111
"from his nonfiction book In Cold Blood."

924
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:01,178
"The true-crime novel
tells of killers Richard Hickock...

925
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,651
"and Perry Smith...

926
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,494
"who brutally murdered a Kansas family
three years ago."

927
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:14,433
- Wait, who sent that to you?
- That's not your goddamn business.

928
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,764
It is my business, because it's not true.

929
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,465
The organizers of the reading needed a title.

930
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:23,669
They picked one,
a sensational one, I admit...

931
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,473
to attract a crowd.

932
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,350
- They picked it?
- Yes.

933
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,957
- It's not your title.
- Perry, I haven't chosen one yet.

934
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:44,529
How could I choose a title when we still
haven't talked about that night?

935
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:49,194
How could I? I couldn't possibly.

936
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,738
You pretended to be my friend.

937
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,376
I'm sorry.

938
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,081
I should have told you.

939
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,287
And I couldn't pretend to be your friend...

940
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:12,650
'cause the truth is,
I can't help wanting to be.

941
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,326
You don't have to tell me anything...

942
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,100
if you don't want to.

943
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,079
I have something...

944
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:42,613
from your sister.

945
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,800
She misses you.

946
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,613
Look at my belly.

947
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,709
There must be something wrong with us,
to do what we did.

948
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,688
We heard there was $10,000 in that house.

949
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,290
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over...

950
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:01,064
I knew the guy that told us about it
was wrong.

951
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,227
There was no money.

952
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,142
Dick wouldn't believe it...

953
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:12,040
so he went tearing through the house,
banging on the walls...

954
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,074
Iooking for a safe.

955
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,080
When he was done...

956
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:25,820
he said he was gonna go up
to Nancy's room and have his way with her.

957
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,623
I wouldn't allow it.

958
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,521
And I told him that.

959
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,659
So I sat with her.

960
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,663
Dick came up and got me.

961
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:41,297
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement...

962
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,743
where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.

963
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,415
He kept saying, "No witnesses"...

964
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:53,981
but I figured if I waited him out, he'd...

965
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:57,124
He'd give up
and we'd leave them tied up there.

966
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,594
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.

967
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:05,231
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.

968
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,360
And he looked hurt, so I cut him down.

969
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:14,440
I put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.

970
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:21,506
He asked how his wife and daughter was
and I said they were fine...

971
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:25,352
and they were getting ready for sleep,
and it wouldn't be long...

972
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,620
till morning when they'd find him.

973
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,132
He was just looking at me.

974
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,096
Looking into my eyes.

975
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:46,068
Like he expected me to kill him.

976
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:51,276
Like he expected me to be
the kind of person who would kill him.

977
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:02,317
I was thinking,
"This nice man is scared of me."

978
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,920
I was so ashamed.

979
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:19,302
I mean, I thought he was a very nice...

980
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:23,472
gentle man.

981
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,741
And I thought so right up till I slit his
throat.

982
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,749
I didn't know what I did
till I heard the sound.

983
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,175
Added up...

984
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:39,019
how much money
did you get from the Clutters that night?

985
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,187
Between $40 and $50.

986
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,908
I mean, the truth is,
I'm desperate to be done with it.

987
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,982
I've spent four years of my life on this book.

988
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,659
They got a stay of execution yesterday.

989
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:09,001
Another, yes.

990
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,008
Supreme Court.

991
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,146
It's harrowing.

992
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:27,447
Me, all I want to do is to write the ending
and there's no end in sight.

993
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:44,397
No, thank you.

994
01:30:57,585 --> 01:31:01,521
"Dear friend Truman,
haven't heard from you in such a long while.

995
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:04,383
"Please help find new lawyer.

996
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,496
"If not, Dick will have to write
the Supreme Court brief himself.

997
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:15,734
"Our last appeal.
What a pair of wretched creatures.

998
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,338
"Please help. Your amigo?"

999
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,601
"Perry."

1000
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:25,770
Just put it with the others.

1001
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:56,876
You know, at least for Nelle...

1002
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,742
you should try and pretend
you're having a good time tonight.

1003
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,918
I thought I'd find you here.

1004
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:49,624
Oh, Nelle.

1005
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:53,557
Thank you.

1006
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:55,903
I'll have another, please.

1007
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:01,403
- How are you?
- Terrible.

1008
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,971
I'm sorry to hear that.

1009
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:08,445
I mean, it's torture the way...

1010
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:11,784
What they're doing to me.

1011
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,282
And now it's the Supreme Court.

1012
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,226
And can you believe it?

1013
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:26,333
If they win this appeal...

1014
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:29,062
I will...

1015
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,771
have a complete nervous breakdown.

1016
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,942
I may never recover...

1017
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:42,080
and I'll just pray that it turns my way.

1018
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:48,044
- It must be difficult.
- It's torture.

1019
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,653
They're torturing me.

1020
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,052
I see.

1021
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:01,159
And how'd you like the movie, Truman?

1022
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:28,359
I frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.

1023
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,307
Hello.

1024
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,638
- Mr. Truman Capote?
- Yeah.

1025
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:22,012
I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith
in the Kansas Correctional System.

1026
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:24,516
Will you accept charges?

1027
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:26,586
Yes.

1028
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,712
Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

1029
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:29,948
Hello.

1030
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:33,093
Hello?

1031
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:34,626
Hello, Perry.

1032
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:38,558
They let me make a couple of phone calls
before I go down to holding.

1033
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:41,964
You heard
the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?

1034
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,939
No, I didn't. I hadn't heard that.

1035
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:52,636
Yeah.

1036
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:57,411
I'm sorry.

1037
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:03,683
Yeah. They let me make two phone calls.

1038
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:09,851
We got a date set for the warehouse,
Dick and me.

1039
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:14,128
Two weeks and finito.

1040
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:16,496
April 14.

1041
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:21,899
Will you visit me?

1042
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:24,370
Truman?

1043
01:36:52,406 --> 01:36:53,873
It's him again.

1044
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:04,176
It is utterly inappropriate for me
to talk to him.

1045
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:14,750
Yes?

1046
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,128
I'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.

1047
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:37,482
- Hello?
- Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.

1048
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:40,179
I just got this telegram. Has he seen it?

1049
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,413
He won't read it.

1050
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:46,222
- Would you put him on, please?
- Nelle, he won't talk.

1051
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:50,858
Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down
and put the phone on his ear...

1052
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:52,829
I need to speak to him.

1053
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:55,729
All right.

1054
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:19,322
It's Nelle.

1055
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:27,659
Truman.

1056
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:33,002
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.

1057
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:38,775
"Sorry that Truman was unable to make it
here to the prison...

1058
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:41,976
"for a brief word prior to necktie party.

1059
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:45,547
"Whatever his reason for not showing up...

1060
01:38:46,086 --> 01:38:49,487
"I want him to know
that I cannot condemn him for it.

1061
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:54,056
"Not much time left...

1062
01:38:55,162 --> 01:38:58,598
"but want you both to know
that I've been sincerely grateful...

1063
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:02,862
"for your friendship through the years
and everything else.

1064
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:06,872
"I'm not very good at these things.

1065
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:11,375
"I have become extremely affectionate
toward you both."

1066
01:39:12,346 --> 01:39:14,780
"But, harness time."

1067
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:20,018
"Adios, amigos. Your friend, Perry."

1068
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:35,159
Well, I didn't expect to see you again.

1069
01:39:36,437 --> 01:39:38,371
You can visit for a few minutes.

1070
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,272
- Yeah.
- No.

1071
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:52,184
Five minutes.

1072
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,953
Well, well.

1073
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:00,390
He returns.

1074
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:04,524
I don't know what you must think of me.

1075
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:09,769
Well, you haven't been foremost
on my mind lately...

1076
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:11,962
as you can probably imagine.

1077
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,504
You got the letter?

1078
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,077
Yes, I did.

1079
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:28,616
It's true.
I understand why you didn't want to come.

1080
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:33,115
I wouldn't be here either if I didn't have to.

1081
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,921
You got that right.

1082
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,267
You know Ricardo donated his eyes
to science?

1083
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:47,605
Next week, some blind man will be seeing
what Dick used to see.

1084
01:40:48,675 --> 01:40:51,610
Yeah, you could be walking in Denver
or somewhere, Truman...

1085
01:40:51,745 --> 01:40:54,737
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.

1086
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:57,974
That would be something, wouldn't it?

1087
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:02,049
It would be. It would be.

1088
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:17,630
You'll be watching?

1089
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,139
I don't know, I'll be...

1090
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,807
Do you want me to?

1091
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,884
I'd like to have a friend there.

1092
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:35,352
Okay. Then I will.

1093
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,699
It's all right.

1094
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:09,155
I did everything I could.

1095
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,014
It's okay.

1096
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:22,599
I truly did.

1097
01:42:24,538 --> 01:42:25,664
I know.

1098
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:35,877
It's time.

1099
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:47,623
Mr. Capote.

1100
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:04,970
Goodbye.

1101
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:07,413
You're not rid of us yet.

1102
01:43:08,315 --> 01:43:10,510
- We'll see you in a few minutes.
- I wish I had...

1103
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:11,948
Mr. Capote.

1104
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:14,615
- Mr. Capote.
- Goodbye.

1105
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,768
Nice to see you.

1106
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:56,582
Perry Edward Smith.

1107
01:44:56,923 --> 01:45:00,552
For the crime of murder in the first degree,
by order of the Court of Finney County...

1108
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:02,719
and the Supreme Court
of the sovereign state of Kansas...

1109
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:04,558
you are sentenced to hang until you die.

1110
01:45:04,698 --> 01:45:07,531
"I will fear no evil: For thou art with me.

1111
01:45:07,934 --> 01:45:10,164
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

1112
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,636
You can say something if you want.

1113
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,173
Is there anybody from the family here?

1114
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:22,439
No, Perry.

1115
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:29,082
Well, tell them...

1116
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:39,394
I can't remember what I was gonna say
for the life of me.

1117
01:45:57,784 --> 01:46:01,049
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

1118
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:05,418
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

1119
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,492
Give us this day our daily bread.

1120
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:11,664
And forgive those who trespass against us.

1121
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:15,957
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1122
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,862
It was a terrible experience...

1123
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:53,331
and I will never get over it.

1124
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:58,806
They're dead, Truman. You're alive.

1125
01:47:00,881 --> 01:47:04,408
And there wasn't anything
I could have done to save them.

1126
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:08,785
Maybe not...

1127
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:14,894
but, the fact is, you didn't want to.
