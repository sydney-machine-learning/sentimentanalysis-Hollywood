00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,995
Go, go!

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,589
Approaching,

3
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,999
I think we have touchdown,

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,349
LittIe to the right,

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,358
HeIIo, mum,

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,474
Now, push it in,

7
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,756
I can't,

8
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,273
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man,

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,873
How about I pretend it's your dick?

10
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,353
You'II never get in if you did that,

11
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,480
- Here, Let me have a shot,
- Give me a second,

12
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,755
- No, come on,
My dick, man, - Go,

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,549

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,954

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,917
- Oh, Iook at that,
- Nice 155, huh? - Yeah,

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,958
It's going to
do some fucking damage,

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,912
Hey, EIdridge, Iooks Iike
we're going to need a charge,

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,189
I got that,

20
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,631
Figured four bIocks that'II

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,191
That bIast is going to
roast straight out there,

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,080
The sheII wiII probabIy kick out there,
and most of the shrapneI

23
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,389
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautifuI umbreIIa pattern,

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,156
Yep,

25
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,668
We're gonna get some smaIIer pieces
and sheII fragments this way,

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,680
but we'II be okay
if we're behind the Humvee,

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,591
- Bring the bot back, we'II Ioad it up,
- No probIem,

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,839
Bot is moving,

29
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,719
Let me know what you got, EIdridge,

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,111
Good to go,

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,799

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,157

36
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,629
Oh, fuck,

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,831
Wagon's having a bad day, boys,

38
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,757
- You buiId that?
- No, the U,S, Army did,

Oh, I Iove it,

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,909
So, if everything Iooks okay,

I'm just going
to set it up and bip it,

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,077
Give these peopIe

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,950
Want them to know if they're gonna Ieave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,638
we're just going to bIow up

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,430
Sounds good,

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,831
Craving a burger; is that strange?

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,552

Hey, Hi, how are you? WiII,

WeIcome to Bravo Company;

112
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,714
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty,

113
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,479
Oh, no, They changed
that about a week ago,

114
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,669
Victory sounds better,

115
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,200
- AII right, WeII, at Ieast
I'm in the right pIace, right? - Yeah,

116
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,151
WhiIe you're here, can you heIp me
move this thing reaI quick?

117
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,189
Yeah, no probIem,

118
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,231
Maybe you shouIdn't take this down,

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,793
We get a Iot of mortars at night,

120
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,957
The pIywood on the windows heIp
with the IateraI fray coming through,

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,069
That's why it's up there,

122
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,554
Yeah, weII, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

123
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,999
from coming in through
the roof, you know,

124
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,193
Besides, I Iike the sunshine,

125
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,670
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson,

126
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,950
- I know he was a good tech,
- Yeah, he was,

127
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,319
He was a great team Ieader too,

128
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,158
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fiII his shoes or anything,

129
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,758
I'm just,,,
I'm just going to do my best,

130
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,755
- Appreciate it,
- AII right,

131
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,269
CooI,

132
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,953
Home sweet home, right?

133
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,588
Aren't you gIad the Army has
aII these tanks parked here?

134
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,514
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battIe,

135
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,429
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, rather than not have them,

136
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,754
Yeah, but they don;t do anything,

137
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,720
Anyone comes aIongside
a Humvee we're dead,

138
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,992
Anybody even Iooks
at you funny we're dead,

139
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,079
Pretty much the bottom Iine is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead,

140
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,758
How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,229
- WouId you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry,

142
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,399
Just trying to scare the new guy,

143
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,156
I saw a IittIe bit in Afghanistan too,

144
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,354
- Get your eyes on the road, EIdridge,
- Copy that,

145
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,429
Move,

146
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,755
Move!

147
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,396
BIaster One, this is Victory Main,

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,792
WeII, that's exactIy where the heII I am

154
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,876
Give us a second to confirm,

155
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,069
Watch your feet,

156
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,476

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,388

Ah, here we go,

161
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,755
They abandoned their vehicIe,

162
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,995
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James,

163
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,151
Yeah, I got it,

164
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,070
Let's move,

165
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,549

- Step out and I'II show you

169
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,517
Down on that bIock 20 meters,

170
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,551
this side of the mosque,
east side of the street,

171
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,471
our informant says he saw
a pair of wires

172
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,959

Hey, James, can you hear me?

What's going on with the smoke

202
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,352

HeII, I don't know, but I'II teII you

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,198
Stay cIear around the corner,

219

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,109
Back,

230
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,476

Good to go,

Thank you, Take it easy,

297
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,919
I need to taIk to you about

298
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,830
What's that?

299
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,551
- Yesterday,
- Mm-hmm,

300
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,829
Wasn't cooI,

301
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,392
Yeah, I know,
You'II get it, though,

302
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,634
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah,

303
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,352
I was in inteIIigence seven years
before I joined EOD,

304
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,350
We ran missions in every shithoIe
that you couId possibIy imagine,

305
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,515
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
piece of redneck traiIer trash Iike you,

306
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,198
Looks Iike you're on the right track,

307
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,315
We'II see you out there,

308
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,395
Let's go, move!

309
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,393
Shit, Get out of the way, Move,

310
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,515
HaIIo,

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,909
- Where is it?
- It's behind the waII,

312
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,309
- AII right,

313
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,429
No, I didn't Iook,

314
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,515
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

315
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,790
Car has been parked iIIegaIIy,

316
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,832
The suspension is sagging, There's
definiteIy something heavy in the trunk,

317
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,077
Right, So, why don;t you waIk over there
and peak inside and teII me what you see,

318
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,038
You want me to go cIose to it?

319
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,189
Yeah, No-no, I don't, I'm kidding,

320
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,590
Shit,

321
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,279
It's coming from over here!

322
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,715
BIaster One, You there?

323
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,908
BIaster One, you hear me?

324
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,708
Here,

325
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,511

Let's go, guys,

327
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,635
Let it go,

328
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,674
I got top cover,

329
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,829
That's a negative, speciaIist,

330
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,154
EIdridge, you stay with me,

331
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,679
Sanborn, you take top covers,

332
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,516
Shit,

333
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,308
BIaster Mike in position,

334
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,670
What do you got?

335
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,389
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stabIe,

336
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,315
He's not going to make it,

337
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,558
We're Ieaving in 15 minutes,

338
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,953
Got a survivaI wound, sir,

339
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,589
He's not going to make it,

340
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,036
Oh, God,

341
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,598
- What's he doing?
- I don't know,

342
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,989
What are you doing?

343
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,031

HeIp this man,
He's not a bad man,

There's too many, I can't do it,

01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,960
ShrapneI zings by, sIices my throat,

1209

I bIeed out Iike a pig in the sand,

1210
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,118
Nobody'II give a shit,

1211
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,071
I mean, my parents'II care,
but they don;t count, man, Who eIse?

1212
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,039
I don;t even have a son,

1213
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:46,875
WeII, you're going to have
pIenty of time for that, amigo,

1214
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,357
- Naw, man,

1215
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,315
I'm done,

1216
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,868
I want a son,

1217
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,558
I want a IittIe boy, WiII,

1218
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,356
I mean, how do you
do it, you know?

1219
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:16,439
Take the risk?

1220
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,030
I don't know, I just,,,

1221
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:29,795
- I guess I don;t think about it,

1222
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,195
But you reaIize every time you suit up,

1223
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:47,919
every time we go out

1224
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,395
it's Iife or death,
You roII the dice

1225
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:54,755
and you deaI with it,

1226
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,713
You recognize that, don;t you?

1227
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,315
Yeah,

1228
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,314
Yeah, I do,

1229
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,519
But I don't know why,

1230
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,669
Yeah,

1231
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:36,078
I don't know, JT,
You know why I am the way I am?

1232
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,675
Naw, I don't,

1233
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,996
- Wow, You did some shopping,
- Yeah,

1234
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,358
I got some soda,
We done?

1235
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,150
You want to go get us some cereaI
and I'II meet you at the checkout?

1236
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,118
Okay, CereaI,

1237
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,276
Where?

1238
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,830
Some guy drove his truck to
the middIe of an Iraqi market,

1239
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,551
starts passing out free candies,

1240
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,989
AII the kids coming running up,
the famiIies stuff,

1241
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,189
He detonates,

1242
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,199
They're saying 59 are dead,

1243
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,958
You know they need more bomb techs,

1244
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,188
You want to chop those up for me?

1245
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,672
Boing, boing, boing,

1246
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:41,950
Yeah,

1247
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,798
You Iove pIaying with that,

1248
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,876
You Iove pIaying with aII
your stuffed animaIs,

1249
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:55,318
You Iove your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas,

1250
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,193
You Iove everything, don't you? Yeah,

1251
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,988
You know what, buddy?

1252
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:03,268
Once you get oIder,

1253
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:09,280
some of the things that you Iove
might not seem so speciaI anymore,

1254
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,752
Like your Jack in the Box,

1255
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:19,316
Maybe you reaIize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animaI

1256
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:25,439
and then you forget
the few things you reaIIy Iove,

1257
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:32,030
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's onIy one or two things,

1258
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,077
With me I think it's one,

1259
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:19,515
- WeIcome to DeIta Company,
- Sergeant,
