1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,440
The Ring of the Fisherman,
which bears the official papal seal,

2
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,040
must be destroyed immediately
following the Pope's death.

3
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
The Papal apartment is then
sealed for nine days of mourning,

4
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,000
a period known as "Sede Vacante",
the time of the empty throne.

5
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,868
Over the last several days,
Catholic leaders

6
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,040
from every corner of the world
have flocked to Rome,

7
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,640
shocked by the sudden death of
this progressive and beloved pope.

8
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,000
Today, in St. Peter's Square,
the faithful pray that there is

9
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,280
among them another leader
who can unite their church,

10
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,400
which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years.

11
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
As the body of the pontif passes by,

12
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,000
we see prayers are being
offered by the Preferiti,

13
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,960
favorites among those being considered
to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

14
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,200
At the end of the mourning period,

15
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,828
the College of Cardinals
will lock itself

16
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,900
behind the doors of the
Sistine Chapel for Conclave.

17
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:30,920
The process by which they
will choose a new leader

18
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,320
for the world's one billion Catholics

19
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,600
who now find their
church at a crossroads,

20
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,000
its ancient traditions
threatened by a modern world.

21
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,440
Attention: Control booth going online.

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
We are powering up.

23
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Attention Category 1 personnel.

24
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,480
Interlock areas are now restricted.

25
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
You've blocked all access, Philippe.

26
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,580
You are terrified because
you gave it your all.

27
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:14,200
The accelerator should
never create antimatter.

28
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,240
It's only three cylinders under high
security. I only ask you to wait.

29
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,028
We can't wait any longer.

30
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,640
Antimatter is only the beginning.
We will have free access.

31
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,080
But listen, even with proper
calibration, we might not be prepared.

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,960
Just call the director. Stop this.

33
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
ATLAS underground is
now a restricted vault.

34
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,720
Vittoria, Vittoria...

35
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
Protons are being loaded.

36
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,040
This will not blast us to
the other side, so, please.

37
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,880
Powering on LHC magnets.

38
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,600
Ionic stage in 4, 3, 2...

39
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
Start the collision sequence.

40
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,600
Vittoria, what did Phillipe want?

41
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,360
He about shitted. We should
still wait. What do you think?

42
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,200
It's now or never.

43
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,800
Beam stability is good.
Take your places, people.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
ATLAS and CMS checked.

45
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,440
Trigger is set. Collision is imminent.

46
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,600
Let's hope the heavy
ion guys didn't mess up.

47
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,080
Luminosity monitors operational.

48
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
B-line has no restrictions.

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,940
Enable beam capture.

50
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,880
Accelerating the beam.

51
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Stage 1: Line up.

52
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,920
Magnets to full field.

53
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,640
Last P still too high.

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,560
We are moving up the
luminosity 10 to 34.

55
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,600
Eject particle beams.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
Filling the LHC.

57
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,040
Fusion commenced.
We are back online.

58
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,880
The merger may be any time.

59
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,748
Particles in transition.

60
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,920
Collisions are fixed and running.

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,760
LHC injecting protons: Beam 1.

62
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,960
Lock the feedback systems.

63
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,560
Particles at 99% the speed of light.

64
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,000
Colliding stable beams.

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,240
Enact injection kicker.

66
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,400
We have a signal on
the luminosity monitors.

67
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,640
We have events.

68
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
Protons are moving.

69
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
We have created antimatter.

70
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,880
The unknown has been created.

71
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,840
Silvano, we have succeeded.

72
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,800
We are now in God's hands, Vittoria.

73
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,920
I am on my way.

74
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,560
Silvano?

75
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Silvano!

76
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
Oh, God.

77
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,200
Help! Aiuto! Aiuto!

78
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,440
- A swim might help your jet lag.
- I beg your pardon?

79
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,160
The bags under your eyes.
It's five in the morning

80
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
and you're from the Vatican.

81
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,720
Crossed keys under the Triregnum.

82
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,640
It's a papal symbol.

83
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,640
Claudio Vicenze.
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

84
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
Vatican Police?

85
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,400
I was expecting another letter.

86
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
My request for access to your archives.

87
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

88
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
Kind of a busy time for you guys, huh?

89
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,600
In fact, I was in New York.

90
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,560
A detail to the UN. I received a
phone call in the middle of the night.

91
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,080
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.
A matter of great urgency."

92
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,400
They said to show you this.

93
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
The Illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

94
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:56,480
Did they?

95
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,588
Look at that again. It's an ambigram.

96
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,000
It's the same image,
forward and backward.

97
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,560
Now, that's common for a
symbol like a Yin and Yang

98
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,800
or a swastika but... that's a word.

99
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,960
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has
been considered a myth for 400 years.

100
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,028
Supposedly, in the 16th century,

101
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,400
some artist created it as a tribute
to Galileo's love of symmetry.

102
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,400
It was only gonna be revealed when the
Illuminati had amassed enough power

103
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
to resurface and carry
out their final goal.

104
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
I wrote a book about it.

105
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,960
Which is why you're here.

106
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
"The Art of the Illuminati"
by Robert Langdon.

107
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,040
Part One.

108
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,428
I haven't been able to finish Part Two

109
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,520
because I'm not allowed
access to your archives.

110
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,880
It's remarkable. Similar.

111
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,840
Someone is trying to make you believe the
Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome.

112
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,000
Right after the death of a pope.

113
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,400
Four cardinals were kidnapped from
their quarter's inside the Vatican

114
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,228
sometime between 3
and 5 am this morning.

115
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,520
Shortly afterward, that document was
sent to the office of the Swiss Guard

116
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,840
along with the threat

117
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,080
the Cardinals will be
publicly executed

118
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,640
one per hour begining
at 8 pm tonight in Rome.

119
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,708
The conclave?

120
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,628
Was to begin today.

121
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,880
We have postponed the
start for a few hours

122
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:24,988
with the story of illness.

123
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,640
There are no suspicions... yet.

124
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,200
What do you want from me?

125
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,040
These criminals, who sent this ambigram,
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

126
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:40,800
But Captain Olivetti think if you
can use it to learn their identity,

127
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:43,920
perhaps we can stop this abomination.

128
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,040
Why me?

129
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Your expertise. Your erudition.

130
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,280
Your recent involvement
with certain church...

131
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,760
shall we say... mysteries.

132
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,240
I wasn't under the impression that
episode had endeared me to the Vatican.

133
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,720
Oh, it didn't.

134
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,360
But it did make you,
what is the word for...

135
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,640
"formidable"?

136
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,800
Formidable?

137
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,560
A Vatican jet is standing
by twenty minutes from here.

138
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,120
Will you come with me?

139
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,068
Professor Langdon.

140
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
You've spent your life searching for symbols
like the one you now hold in your hand.

141
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,720
How much longer are we going to pretend
you have not already decided to come?

142
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,600
If the Illuminati have
returned and are in Rome,

143
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,680
we will hunt them down and kill them.

144
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,360
The Illuminati did not become
violent until the 17th century.

145
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,428
Their name means
'The Enlightened Ones'.

146
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,920
They were physicists,
mathematicians, astronomers.

147
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,600
They were concerned with the
church's inaccurate teachings

148
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,800
and they were dedicated
to scientific truth.

149
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,508
But the Vatican didn't like that.

150
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,800
So, the church began
to, how did you say it?

151
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,880
Oh. Hunt them down and kill them.

152
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,000
Drove them underground

153
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,760
into a secret society.

154
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,980
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes?

155
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:06,600
Welcome to Vatican City.

156
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,040
Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector
General of the Vatican Police Force.

157
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:11,986
My pleasure.

158
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:12,828
This way please.

159
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,640
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

160
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,000
- I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.

161
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,680
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls

162
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:27,240
with the exception of the
security of His Holiness...

163
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,080
- Yeah.
- ... and the Apostolic Palace.

164
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:29,920
That is Swiss Guard.

165
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,160
i}The Roman Carabinieri are here as
well in an advisory capacity.

166
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,320
So jurisdictionally this is...

167
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:36,440
A goddamn nightmare.

168
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,360
- Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration.
- I beg your pardon?

169
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:53,080
1857. Pope Pius IX felt the
male form would inspire lust.

170
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,120
So, he took a hammer and chisel and
'un-manned' hundreds of these statues.

171
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,160
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

172
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,360
Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?

173
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

174
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,280
I urge you to guard your tone here.

175
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,320
The Swiss Guard is a
calling, not a profession,

176
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,880
and it encourages a certain civiltry.

177
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,280
Commander Richter, the head of the
Guard, is a deeply spiritual man.

178
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,600
He was close to the
late Pope. Understood?

179
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,720
Look, I dont study symbols because
I consider them unimportant.

180
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:37,120
Ceremony, traditions,
heavily mark our lives.

181
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,240
I just hope I can help.
- So do I.

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,040
You were my idea.

183
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Wait here. Please.

184
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,600
Commander? Commander Richter?

185
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,840
Doctor Vetra?

186
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm Commander Richter, principal of
the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming.

187
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,428
Oh. Professor Langdon.

188
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,120
What a relief.
The symbologist is here.

189
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,920
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

190
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,028
The situation has changed.

191
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,600
We received another
threat from the kidnapper.

192
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,400
The canister was stolen from
my lab around noon yesterday.

193
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:38,760
The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Paintivolio

194
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,360
and mutilated him in
order to bypass security.

195
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,760
We use retinal scanners.

196
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,840
They cut out his eye.

197
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra?

198
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600
- Where is that camera, number 86?
- It's wireless.

199
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,148
It, too, was stolen. It could be
anywhere inside the Vatican walls.

200
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
That canister contains an extremely
combustible substance called antimatter.

201
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:02,360
We need to locate it immediately.
We evacuate Vatican City.

202
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:04,786
I'm quite familiar with
incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

203
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:07,108
I've never heard of
antimatter being used as such.

204
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,440
Well, its never been generated
in significant quantities before.

205
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,200
It's a way of studying the
origins of the universe.

206
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,120
To try to isolate what some
people call "the God Particle".

207
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:19,000
But there are implications
for energy, research-

208
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:19,800
"God Particle"?

209
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,068
What you call it isn't important.

210
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
It's what gives all matter mass.
The thing without which we could not exist.

211
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,280
You're talking about the moment of creation.
- Yes, in a way, I am.

212
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,348
The antimatter is suspended there...

213
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,920
in an airtight nano-composite shell
with electromagnets on each end.

214
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,588
But if it were to
fall out of suspension,

215
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,280
and come into contact with matter,
say with the bottom of the canister,

216
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,920
then, the two opposing forces would
annihilate one another violently.

217
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,560
What might cause it to
fall out of suspension?

218
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,840
The battery going dead.

219
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
Which it will just before midnight.

220
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
What kind of annihilation? How violent?

221
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,600
A cataclysmic event.

222
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,760
A blinding explosion
equivalent to about 5 kilotons.

223
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,680
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

224
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,920
Those are the exact
words the kidnapper used.

225
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,680
We will destroy your four pillars.

226
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,280
We will brand your Preferiti and
sacrifice them on the altars of science.

227
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,240
Then bring your church down upon you.

228
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,920
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

229
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,440
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

230
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,040
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
Destruction of Vatican City through light.

231
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,960
Four pillars. There's
your kidnapped cardinals.

232
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti,
the favorites to be named the next Pope.

233
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,240
Play it again.

234
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,920
We will destroy your four pillars.

235
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,760
We will brand your Preferiti...

236
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,720
Wait, stop it. Stop.

237
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,160
Brand them?

238
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,280
That's another Illuminati legend.

239
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,400
This one says that there
are a set of five 'Brands'.

240
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
Each one an ambigram.

241
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,400
The first four are the
fundamental elements of science:

242
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
earth, air, fire and water.

243
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,400
Th fifth is a mystery.

244
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,400
Maybe it's this.

245
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
You said they'd be killed publicly.

246
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,120
Yes. Revenge. For La Purga.

247
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,040
La Purga?

248
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,200
Geez, you guys don't even
read your own history, do you?

249
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,600
1668. The church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists

250
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,680
and branded each one of them on the
chest with the symbol of the cross.

251
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,600
To 'purge' them of their
sins and they executed them,

252
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,960
threw their bodies out in the street

253
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
as a warning to others
to stop questioning

254
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,120
church rulings on scientific
matters. They radicalized them.

255
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,240
The Purga created a darker,
more violent Illuminati.

256
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,840
One bent on... on retribution.

257
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,400
And look how they intend to
finally get it. Using anti-matter.

258
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Technology to destroy the church.
Science obliterates religion.

259
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,400
Is there any more?

260
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,040
...and sacrifice them
on the altars of science.

261
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,920
Then bring your church down upon you.

262
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,480
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

263
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,160
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

264
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
Path of Illumination?

265
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,360
I need access to the Vatican archives.

266
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,520
Professor, I don't think this
is the appropriate moment-

267
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,920
Your petition has been
denied seven times.

268
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,948
No, no. This has-
This has nothing to do with my work.

269
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,680
The Path of Illumination
is a hidden trail through Rome itself

270
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:55,520
that leads to the
Church of the Illumination.

271
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,040
The place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

272
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,520
If I can find the "Segno", the sign,
that marks the beginning of that path,

273
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,628
the four churches along it.

274
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,040
It may be where he intends
to murder your Cardinals.

275
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,720
One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Then the device explodes at midnight.

276
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,640
If we could figure out the first
church and get there before he does,

277
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,040
maybe we could stop it.

278
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,280
But I can't find the start of the
path until I get into the archives.

279
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,400
Even if I wanted to help you,

280
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,480
access to the archives
is only by written decree

281
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,160
by the curator on the
Board of Vatican Librarians.

282
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,600
Or by papal mandate.

283
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,680
Yes, but, as you no doubt have
heard, the Holy Father is dead.

284
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,520
What about il Camerlengo?

285
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,480
The Camerlengo is just a priest
here. The former pope's chamberlain.

286
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?

287
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,400
Fellas, you called me.

288
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,880
His Holiness once told me

289
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,160
the Pope is a man torn between
the real world and the divine.

290
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,080
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

291
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.

292
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,000
The Purga is a dark stain
on this church's history.

293
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

294
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,360
Commandante, have you begun a
search for this explosive device?

295
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,120
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

296
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,680
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

297
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,560
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

298
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave,

299
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:32,600
your security concerns
are at a minimum.

300
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,920
Devote as many of your people-

301
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,200
Signore, if you are about to suggest
a naked eye search

302
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:38,686
of the entire Vatican City,
I will tell you...

303
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,120
- Commander.
- ... I do not have the people.

304
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,360
Although I am not His Holiness,

305
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,920
when you are addressing me,
you are addressing this office.

306
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:45,880
Do you understand?

307
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,240
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

308
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,960
Now, you said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

309
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,720
Might I suggest methodically cutting
power to various sections of the city?

310
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,828
When the image on the
screen goes dark,

311
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,080
you'll have a more specific
idea of the camera's location.

312
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,560
Dr. Vetra, beside yourself
and your research partner,

313
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,080
who else knew about
this antimatter project?

314
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,680
No one but the research team.

315
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,400
This project was strictly confidential.

316
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,588
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

317
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,600
If he told anyone else
about what we were doing,

318
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:25,920
he would have made a note of it.

319
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,680
And do you have these journals?

320
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,800
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

321
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,120
Please.

322
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,120
Professor Langdon.

323
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,320
Mr. Langdon.

324
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,280
You are correct that I may
grant you access to the archives.

325
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,000
Thank you, Padre.

326
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,680
I said that you are correct that I may,
not- not that I will.

327
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,840
Christianity's most sacred
codes are in that archive.

328
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Given your recent
entanglement with the church,

329
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,280
there is a question I'd like to ask you
first, here, in the office of His Holiness.

330
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,880
Do you believe in God, Sir?

331
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,640
Father, I simply
believe that religion...

332
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,360
I did not ask you if you
believe what man says about God.

333
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,680
I asked if you believe in God.

334
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,360
I'm an academic.

335
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,960
My mind tells me I will
never understand God.

336
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,400
And your heart?

337
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,160
Tells me I'm not meant to.

338
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,960
Faith is a gift that
I have yet to receive.

339
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,440
Be delicate with our treasures.

340
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,600
- The archives are this way.
- Professor Langdon?

341
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,680
If this path really leads to
the Church of Illumination,

342
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,040
that may be where they've
hidden the antimatter.

343
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,040
The shining star at the end
of the path. I thought so, too.

344
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,160
Follow the path and we may find
the canister at the end of it.

345
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,720
Can you deactivate the device?

346
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,840
I can change the canister's batteries as long
as we have more than five minutes of life.

347
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,200
That would give us another 24
hours to get it safely back to CERN.

348
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,320
- Robert Langdon.
- Vittoria Vetra.

349
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,640
Are you really a symbologist
or was he mocking you?

350
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,840
No. Both. You're a physicist?

351
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,680
Bioentanglement Physics.
The interconnective life systems?

352
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay.

353
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,360
Your project... it was to give
towards the energy research?

354
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,720
Eventually, yes.

355
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,080
One pack of antimatter could
power an entire city for a month.

356
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

357
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,720
What are we looking for in the archives?
- A banned volume written by Galileo.

358
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,800
- Galileo was Illuminati?
- Yeah, and an obedient Catholic.

359
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,480
Who didn't think the church
and science were enemies

360
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,920
but just a different language
telling the same story.

361
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,680
Anyone of like minds could find
the Church of Illumination.

362
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,200
But he couldn't exactly advertise its
location, so he created a coded path.

363
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,720
Richter has started to turn
off the power at various rates.

364
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,240
It will be back on in a minute.

365
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,360
Then some unknown Illuminati
master sculpted four statues.

366
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,200
Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements:

367
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,760
earth, air, fire, water.

368
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,240
And placed the statues out in
public, in churches throughout Rome.

369
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,320
Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.

370
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,840
At the end of the path was
the Church of Illumination.

371
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,800
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

372
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,720
What makes you think he's going to
murder the cardinals in the churches?

373
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,840
The Illuminati called those four churches
by the special name "L'altare de la Scienza".

374
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,400
Sacrifice them on the
altars of science, he said.

375
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,720
Exactly.

376
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, wow. Look at this.

377
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,960
Excuse me. Signori.

378
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,200
Cardinal Strauss, have you
been informed of the situation?

379
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:38,960
Yeah.

380
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,360
My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.

381
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,040
At this late hour?

382
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,080
That would be highly unorthodox.

383
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,600
And, yet, was ensured to wrought
my power in great elective.

384
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,180
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

385
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,720
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

386
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,228
Only those I hold for my church.

387
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,720
St. Peter's church, which is someday
taken at its most vulnerable moment.

388
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:04,268
And this is not a coincidence.

389
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,080
The church will not fall in a
day. We must evacuate Vatican City.

390
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,160
That is exactly what they
want. Publicity and panic.

391
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:16,200
No. We must not give them
oxygen for the media fire.

392
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,240
But the people in St. Peter's Square?

393
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Care deeply about
their church, as we do.

394
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,548
Their faith will sustain them.

395
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,160
Their faith will not protect
them from an explosion.

396
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,280
We are all bound for heaven
eventually, are we not?

397
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,640
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life.

398
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,480
Patrick, do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold

399
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,360
with your true place
here at the Vatican.

400
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,380
You were a favorite of His Holiness.

401
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:54,000
But His Holiness is with his father now.

402
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,080
Mea culpa.

403
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Seal the doors.

404
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,560
Everyone outside.

405
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,520
This way, please.

406
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,320
Oh. Beautiful.

407
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,680
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

408
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,920
Oxygen is kept at the lowest possible
level. It is a partial vacuum inside.

409
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,240
So, extended stays are not recommended.

410
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,080
So, don't panic if you
feel light headed at first.

411
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,320
I'll be just outside the door,

412
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,880
watching you, Mr. Langdon.

413
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,880
Conclave will go on without us.

414
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,080
It must. Now of all times.

415
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,080
May God forgive you
for what you have done.

416
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,240
Father, if God has issues,

417
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,880
they won't be with what I've done.

418
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,480
They will be with what I'm about to do.

419
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,560
It was confiscated from the Netherlands
by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

420
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,880
I've been petitioning to see it
for about ten years.

421
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,600
Ever since I realized what was in it.

422
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,960
What makes you so sure
that this thing is there?

423
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,188
The number 503.

424
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,440
I kept seeing it, over and over
again. In Illuminati letters.

425
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,120
Scribbled in the margins.
Sometimes just signed '503'.

426
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:40,388
It's a numeric clue, but, to what? Five?

427
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,748
Well, that's a medieval
number to the Illuminati.

428
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,080
There's the pentagram. Pythagoras.
Dozens of other examples in science.

429
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:47,000
But what about 3?

430
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,400
It didn't make sense, until I thought:
What if it's Roman numerals?

431
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:54,360
DIII.
- D3. Galileo's third text.

432
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:58,480
Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma.

433
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,360
Just a few days with this and I
could've actually finished my book.

434
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,160
And sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

435
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,320
Il Diagramma Veritatis.

436
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,560
Diagram of Truth.

437
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,400
I know about the
Dialogo and the Discorsi.

438
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,320
Galileo laid out his theories about
the earth revolving around the sun.

439
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,600
Right. It said the earth was not
the center of some universe

440
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,720
with heaven above, hell below,

441
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,508
as the church had said it was.

442
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,920
So, they forced him to
recant his second book.

443
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,028
But what was this one?

444
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,788
This is how he got the word out.

445
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,600
This is the truth. Not what
the Vatican forced him to write.

446
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,280
Smuggled out of Rome, printed in
Holland on setched papyrus. See?

447
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:47,908
That way, any scientist
that was caught with a copy

448
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,640
could just throw it in water and
Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear.

449
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,788
Between that and Vatican burnings

450
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,000
it's possible this is the
only copy that remains.

451
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
And if I'm correct,

452
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,760
the segno is hidden on page number...

453
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,040
Five.

454
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,680
Yeah.

455
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,440
Do you need help with the Latin?

456
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
Sure.

457
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity...

458
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,040
Sorry. I don't think there's anything
that could be interpreted as a...

459
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,960
Wait, wait, wait.

460
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,680
Do that again.

461
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,000
What is that?

462
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Wait. It's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.

463
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,120
Go back.

464
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
It's in English.

465
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,900
English?

466
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,360
Why English?

467
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,588
English wasn't used in the
Vatican. It was too polluted.

468
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,200
It's free thinking. It was the language
of radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

469
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:04,908
Here's another one.

470
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,080
"The path of light is laid a sacred test.
" Would you write this down as I dictate?

471
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:11,880
Sorry, Professor. No time.

472
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,040
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what the hell? Yeah.

473
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,060
Twenty minutes till eight.
Where are we headed?

474
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,040
Hold on. Hold on.
I'll tell you in a minute.

475
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:40,480
Here. Let me see that page again.

476
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
Where did you get that paper?

477
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,200
We borrowed it.

478
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,600
"From Santi's earthly tomb,
the demon's hole..."

479
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:54,428
Are you insane?

480
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,520
"...across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

481
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,560
"The path of light is
laid in a sacred test."

482
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,240
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

483
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,920
You removed a document
from the Vatican archives?

484
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,600
She did.

485
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,588
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

486
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,320
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

487
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,068
- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

488
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,880
- Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

489
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,840
- So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?
- Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

490
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,280
- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

491
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,280
I just pulled a dozen
of my best men for this.

492
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,068
You better be right.

493
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,020
This is one of the busiest
spot in all of Rome.

494
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:59,920
You can never get away
with it. It's impossible.

495
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:00,588
The poem implies-

496
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,160
The poem? Unbelievable.

497
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm basing this operation on an American's
interpretation of a 400 year old poem.

498
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,880
Well, the information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb

499
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:12,548
and Raphael's tomb is
inside that building.

500
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,880
And because the Vatican destroyed all
of the pagan statues in the late 1800s,

501
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,760
if this is the first marker,

502
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
whatever clues were here to lead
us to the next are sure gone by now.

503
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,560
The path is dead. So, this
is it. Your only chance.

504
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,188
Seperate approaches.

505
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,240
No closer than two blocks and
no uniforms. Three minutes.

506
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,920
I'll need a set of eyes inside.

507
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,880
Excuse me. Two men with symmetric black suits
and earpieces? They're hardly disguised.

508
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,640
That's what I have.
- Well, fine. I'll go in.

509
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:44,708
You don't have communication.

510
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,880
You can't carry a walkie talkie.
It's too conspicuous.

511
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:48,708
Tourists have cell phones, don't they?

512
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,600
No, no. You can't send
her in there alone.

513
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,640
All right. I won't.

514
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,560
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

515
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,120
Well, maybe we're not
getting along today, hmm?

516
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Hold my hand.

517
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,400
- But don't crush it.
- Sorry.

518
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,520
Nervous newlywed.

519
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,920
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

520
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,920
That could be the
demon's hole in the poem.

521
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:30,840
Why are the tombs at an angle?

522
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,560
They're facing east to
worship the rising sun.

523
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:34,868
But this is a Christian church.

524
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,200
New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays

525
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,000
to make conversion less of a shock.

526
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,268
Like the 25th of December.

527
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,000
It's the pagan celebration
of the unconquered sun.

528
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:47,680
It also makes a handy date
for the birth of Christ.

529
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,280
- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

530
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,120
I'll go to the right and
I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

531
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,120
Follow me, please.

532
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,520
Now, the Pantheon, which
means 'Temple of all Gods',

533
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,640
was originally built as a temple to
all the gods of ancient Rome in 27 BC.

534
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,440
Although the building is usually
credited to Agrippa of Damascus...

535
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,160
Robert!

536
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,080
Robert!

537
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,360
It's Raphael's tomb,
but it's the wrong one.

538
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:24,388
What are you talking about?

539
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,920
It was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

540
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
Where was he originally buried?

541
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,788
Urbino, I think.

542
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,640
Santi's earthly tomb. What could
posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?

543
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,640
Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must
mean the chapel that he built.

544
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,348
He's not buried in it. He designed it.

545
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,400
The demon's hole. It's not that oculus.
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

546
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:50,880
Are there any questions?

547
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
Yes. Yes!

548
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,460
Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary anex

549
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:59,720
in an angel figure commissioned
by the Catholic church?

550
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,880
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

551
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,560
One is good.

552
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,828
Wrong? What do you mean wrong?

553
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,340
It's the Chigi chapel in the
Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

554
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:14,800
It was once called Capella della
Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.

555
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:17,268
Earth. The first element. That's it.

556
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,720
- You're certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes.

557
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:22,600
Back to the Vatican.

558
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,628
Back to the Vatican?
You-You can't.

559
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,240
Commandante, if you care at all about
your church, you'll listen to me.

560
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,360
My church?

561
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,988
My church comforts the sick and dying.

562
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,640
My church feeds the hungry.
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

563
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,680
That's right. You don't have one.

564
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,640
Take him if you want. I'm done with him.

565
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,040
All right, this makes sense.
Look, look, look!

566
00:41:58,092 --> 00:41:59,666
Right in front of the church.

567
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,188
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

568
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,840
The Egyptian symbol
adopted by the Illuminati.

569
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,840
If he's going to kill him,
he'll do it here.

570
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,680
Eight o'clock.

571
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,560
No. No. Here. It's an Annulus.

572
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,000
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

573
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,120
Must be in one of these areas.

574
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,120
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

575
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,600
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

576
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,320
The Demon's Hole.

577
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,920
Yeah, but it's askew. Come here.

578
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,080
Give me your flashlight.

579
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,520
What's that?

580
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,480
My Savior Christ will be my judge,
to testify that my voice is His.

581
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:17,960
For I believe that He should
be chosen for the sake of God.

582
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,360
I wish to Pontifex,
Dominicus Scolamiero.

583
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,640
I wish to Pontifex, Eduardo Rossi.

584
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,840
They are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority.

585
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,600
They're waiting for the
Preferiti to be rescued.

586
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,080
Perhaps we should, as well, yes?

587
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,028
Not until the smoke is white

588
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,060
will the College of Cardinals
have chosen a new Holy Father.

589
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:36,040
For now the Vatican seat of
ultimate power remains vacant.

590
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,520
Get the body out of there.
Search the rest of the building.

591
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,120
- Chartrand!
- Sir.

592
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,540
Outside a perimeter.
Secure, but invisible.

593
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:51,760
No lights, no guns.
Nobody knows. Understand?

594
00:47:51,812 --> 00:47:52,720
Yes, sir.

595
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,160
Is it Raphael?

596
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
The chapel is Raphael.

597
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,600
But the sculptures are Bernini.

598
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,360
The unknown Illuminati master?

599
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,800
Bernini?

600
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,320
- He worked for the church.
- Almost exclusively.

601
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,000
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

602
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,800
There wasn't a powerful organization
on earth they didn't penetrate,

603
00:48:23,852 --> 00:48:26,320
including the Vatican,
by hiding in plain sight.

604
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,720
Habakkuk and the Angel.

605
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,360
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the earth.

606
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,600
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

607
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,200
This is the first marker.

608
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,000
The path is a line.

609
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,080
Southwest.

610
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,760
It was pointing southwest.

611
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,388
Earth, air, fire, water.

612
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,200
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture
having something to do with air.

613
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:11,920
The second church is
somewhere southwest of here.

614
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,560
You're sure this time?

615
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,360
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

616
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,360
I could use it now.

617
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,480
The purple layers with these black
crosses represent the churches.

618
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,440
But nothing intersects the line until
it hits... until it hits St. Peter's.

619
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:05,628
Michelangelo designed
St. Peter's, not Bernini.

620
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,360
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

621
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,600
The second marker must be a
statue in St. Peter's Square.

622
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,200
It's ten minutes to nine.
Can you go any faster?

623
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,520
Not unless you want the full
attention of the world press.

624
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,908
No majority in the first vote,

625
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,628
but Cardinal Baggia from
Italy is the clear favorite...

626
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:47,080
Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera
from Spain has the best chance...

627
00:50:47,132 --> 00:50:53,480
The more conceivable candidate could
be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...

628
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,040
Stem cell research is murder!

629
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,840
You condemn sick people to death.

630
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,560
Man is not God.

631
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,308
There. Another obelisk.

632
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,400
Check the crowd. It's almost
nine. He's got to be here already.

633
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,200
Must be a hundred statues up there.

634
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,840
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

635
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,320
How in God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?

636
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,240
Bas relief. Of course.

637
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,468
It's still a sculpture.

638
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,280
Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

639
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,000
Look for another having
something to do with air.

640
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,600
Vento Ponente. West wind.

641
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,960
Vittoria.

642
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,960
Here it is.

643
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,560
West wind. An angel blowing
out five streaks of air.

644
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:50,040
This is it.

645
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,200
Call the police!

646
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,200
Call an ambulance!

647
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,920
He's still alive.

648
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,200
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

649
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,400
"And you squeezed the life
out of a bishop of Rome."

650
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,800
And he's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

651
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,320
That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.

652
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,880
It impliess the Illuminati murdered
him with his own medication.

653
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,440
What?

654
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,120
It's on here.

655
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,920
"With man's solution
we stilled his heart."

656
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,200
"With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy vein."

657
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,600
Did the Holy Father take any
kind of medication by injection?

658
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,880
Tinzaparin.

659
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,680
He had thrombophlebitis.

660
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,120
He took an injection every
day, but no one knew that.

661
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,000
Someone knew it.

662
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,800
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures, as well.

663
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,720
But he took steps to make
sure he was watched for safety.

664
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,920
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

665
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,280
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

666
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,480
An overdose could cause massive
internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages.

667
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,400
It might look like a stroke at first,

668
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,520
but in few days,
his body would show signs.

669
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,708
This could easily be examined.

670
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,360
Ms. Vetra, in case
you're not aware of it...

671
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,520
Papal autopsy is
prohibited by Vatican law.

672
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,960
We're not going to defile his Holiness body
just because of these claims.

673
00:56:46,012 --> 00:56:47,520
But why would they
send this letter now?

674
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,960
In order to cause panic.

675
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,280
"The sun will blind at midnight..."

676
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,840
"and neither police nor
professors can stop it."

677
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,120
He knows I'm here.

678
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,600
Obviously, they were hoping
this letter would become public.

679
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,880
We might be wise to preempt
their next attempt

680
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:02,320
by making an announcement of our own.

681
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,720
- To refute this absurd claim.
- That's out of the question.

682
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,200
Cardinal Strauss has insisted this
entire matter be kept internal.

683
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,480
He shouldn't even be aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.

684
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,200
His final instructions, before
sealing the doors, were very clear.

685
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,480
Cardinal Strauss does not
dictate Vatican protocols.

686
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,100
And to say, yet, technically,
now that conclave has begun,

687
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:25,440
it is privilege and duty to
control public announcements.

688
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,280
I've drafted a press release
about the incident at the piazza,

689
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,560
but any other statements
are specifically prohibited.

690
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,440
For that, the cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.

691
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,080
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

692
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,920
Well, we've turned the power on and off
to about twenty percent of Vatican city

693
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,280
- but nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.

694
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,320
How long would you need
to evacuate everyone?

695
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,440
If I pull all my men from the
search for the bomb, thirty minutes.

696
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,760
Mr. Langdon, you have been
right so far about the path.

697
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,040
It's now 9:15. How quickly
can you find the next church?

698
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,680
The lines of breath on the carving pointed
due east directly away from Vatican City.

699
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,000
But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.

700
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,400
About twenty churches intersect those lines.
None of them have names that invoke fire.

701
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,440
So, the Bernini sculpture must
be inside one of them that does.

702
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
I'm willing to get back
into the archives to find it.

703
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,720
- Would you escort Mr Langdon?
- Yes, Father.

704
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,200
Silvano's journals.
The killer's name could be in here.

705
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,120
- May I stay?
- Please. Fine. Of course.

706
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,240
Professor.

707
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,280
Would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you?

708
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,520
It would surprise the hell out of me.

709
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,520
The Vatican expressed its sympathy
with the families of the victim.

710
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,880
A tourist from Düsseldorf,
whose death is confirmed.

711
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,840
Vatican police have
arrested a suspect...

712
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,120
The investigation is completed.

713
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:16,000
Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's
again, with strict security measures.

714
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,760
The Vatican did admit that, where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.

715
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,200
We're trying now to get the
name of the tourist who was...

716
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,200
But wait.

717
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,680
We're getting word now of smoke.

718
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,240
Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
Apparently, there's been another vote.

719
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,040
The smoke is black.

720
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,560
Once again, the Cardinals have
failed to reach consensus,

721
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,120
and the Catholic Church
remains without a leader.

722
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,160
What are you looking for now?

723
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,880
- Church assets.
- I beg your pardon?

724
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,040
Artwork. It's valuable.

725
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,080
Corporations tend to keep
track of their holdings.

726
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,320
The Catholic church is not
a corporation. It's a beacon.

727
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,040
A source of inspiration for one
billion lost and frightened souls.

728
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,320
Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

729
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,720
Commander Olivetti said that I was
not to leave your side this time.

730
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,440
It wasn't me. It was her.

731
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,000
Power in zone 3 is disabled.

732
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,040
No response on the screen.

733
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,440
Power on zone 3 again
and continue with zone 4.

734
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,960
What sort of signs?

735
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,240
I'm sorry?

736
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,360
If the Holy Father was given
an overdose of Tinzaparin,

737
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,960
what signs would his body bear?

738
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,400
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

739
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,440
His tongue.

740
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,040
Post-mortem, the blood congeals,
then turns the inside of the mouth black.

741
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,920
Even after fourteen days?

742
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,480
It wouldn't show up until at
least a week after his death.

743
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,080
He was very important to me.

744
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,640
Yeah, I understand.

745
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,600
Will you come with me, please?

746
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,428
Signore, would you
organize a security team

747
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,360
to escort Ms. Vetra and
myself down to the crypt?

748
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,320
Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately.

749
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,840
Do you smoke?

750
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,880
A little bit.

751
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,120
You better sit down
before you keel over.

752
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,760
What does this say in Italian?
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.

753
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,000
Moved at suggestion of the artist.

754
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,720
Moved? To another church?
At the suggestion of Bernini?

755
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,320
I don't know.

756
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,960
Here. Translate all of this for me,
and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

757
01:03:00,012 --> 01:03:02,600
I'm looking for a reference of fire.

758
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,520
- Seraphim, meaning "the fiery one".
- Right.

759
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,920
His great golden spear. A point of fire.

760
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,320
Then "woman left completely afire."

761
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,400
The ecstasy of Saint Theresa.
Saint Theresa on fire.

762
01:03:23,452 --> 01:03:26,040
So, this sculpture was
moved to this church?

763
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,560
Why are they shuting down the system?
They know we're down here.

764
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,200
If there's no power, there's no oxygen.

765
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,800
- Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.

766
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
Well, that's disappointing.

767
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,560
- Where are we going?
- To see my father.

768
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,400
I don't understand.

769
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,240
I was orphaned when I
was nine years of age.

770
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,840
A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting
the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.

771
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,160
The Archbishop felt responsible
and he adopted me the following day.

772
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,000
I was raised by him and by the Church.

773
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,920
He was the wisest man I ever met.

774
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:11,080
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained,

775
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,560
but I was brought up in Italy
so I also wanted to do my military service.

776
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:16,480
I wanted to fight.

777
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,868
He told me, "Learn to fly."

778
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,800
So, I joined the Aeronautica Militari.
Flew helicopters.

779
01:04:23,852 --> 01:04:26,200
Bringing the wounded back to hospitals.

780
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,320
- He was a great man.
- Your father died.

781
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,840
Fourteen days ago.

782
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,640
Headquarters, you hear me?

783
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,868
The flow is completed.
Oxygen level is very low.

784
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,400
- Answer, please. Anybody hear me?
- Did you get anything?

785
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,120
No. The walls are lead lined.
There's no signal.

786
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,560
This way.

787
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,440
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

788
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:14,708
Vatican security is impenetrable.

789
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,320
No one from the outside
could've got anywhere near him.

790
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,400
It was someone on the inside.
We can trust no one.

791
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,320
On my screen, no response in zone 7.

792
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,320
We rechon that the
battery will soon be empty

793
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,840
and the device will explode
shortly before midnight.

794
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,040
Holy Father...

795
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,000
when I was young, you've told me the
voice in my heart was God's voice.

796
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,480
You said I should follow
it no matter how painful.

797
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:06,840
Forgive me.

798
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,160
Please, give me strength.

799
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,960
What I do, I do in the name
of everything you believed.

800
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,080
God help us.

801
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,320
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

802
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,200
- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

803
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,500
I think someone just tried to kill me.

804
01:10:44,552 --> 01:10:46,520
Professor, I promise you,
we had no idea.

805
01:10:46,572 --> 01:10:47,668
- He knows I'm here?
- Yes.

806
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,640
You heard me ask permission.
You gave me an escort.

807
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:50,708
Yes, but we had no idea

808
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,960
that portions of our white zones
were crosswired with that building.

809
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,780
Commander Richter was
extending the search.

810
01:10:56,832 --> 01:10:58,600
If he had known the archives
were on that grid,

811
01:10:58,652 --> 01:10:59,960
he never would have killed the power.

812
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,080
But there is the other possibility.

813
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,160
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

814
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,200
have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

815
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,240
Perhaps.

816
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,240
The journals. Where are they?

817
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,880
Who took the journals from this desk?

818
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,800
Signore, this is unacceptable.

819
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,560
For a Camerlengo to enter the
chapel once conclave has begun.

820
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:47,588
Forgive me.

821
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,480
There's been a development.

822
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,708
His Holiness Celestine was murdered!

823
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,640
Is it so inconceivable
that it will happen again?

824
01:12:06,692 --> 01:12:09,560
Signori, please, a moment.
Please. Signori.

825
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,480
Our church is at war.

826
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,800
We are under attack from an old enemy.

827
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,960
The Illuminati.

828
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,000
They have struck us from within.

829
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,200
Murdering our Holy Father!

830
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:30,760
And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new God 'Science'.

831
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,120
They call it retribution.
They think it justified...

832
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,280
because of the Church's attacks on men of
science in the distant past and it's true.

833
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,080
Since the days of Galileo, this church has
tried to slow the relentless march of progress.

834
01:12:44,132 --> 01:12:46,320
Sometimes with misguided means.

835
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,920
But science and
religion are not enemies.

836
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,240
There are simply some things that
science is just too young to understand.

837
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,400
So the Church pleads, "Stop."

838
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,200
"Slow down."

839
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,720
"Think. Wait."

840
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,760
And, for this, they call us backwards.

841
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,640
But who is more ignorant?

842
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,960
The man who cannot define lightning...

843
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,440
or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?

844
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,680
The battle is well under way, signori.

845
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,360
We must defend ourselves.

846
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,120
But, what if this time, we fight
their stealth with openness?

847
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,000
Combat their wicked
scheme with simple truth.

848
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,120
And end this brutish
battle once and for all.

849
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,160
If the outside world could
see this church as I do,

850
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,240
looking beyond the
ritual of these walls,

851
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,960
they would see a modern miracle.

852
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,760
A brotherhood of
imperfect, simple souls...

853
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,920
who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion

854
01:13:41,972 --> 01:13:43,800
in a world spinning out of control.

855
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,480
Signori, I ask..

856
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,440
I pray...

857
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,960
that you break this conclave.

858
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,640
Open the doors,

859
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,520
evacuate St. Peter's Square

860
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,800
and tell the world the truth.

861
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,920
Get him down.

862
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,080
There. There, that
chain. On that pulley.

863
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,720
This bench. Get this pew off
here and make it a ladder.

864
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,120
Vatican Police.

865
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,880
My son...

866
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,360
God answers all prayers, but...

867
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,560
sometimes His answer is no.

868
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,440
The College will not break conclave.

869
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,508
May I suggest...
you direct your energies

870
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,160
to helping the Swiss Guard
find this explosive device.

871
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:43,840
If it exists.

872
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,720
And leave Church leadership...

873
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,280
to its leaders.

874
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,600
Eminence.

875
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,120
There is a growing fear

876
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,948
that without the four Preferiti

877
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,200
it defers much authority
for any candidate.

878
01:18:15,252 --> 01:18:16,960
It will not be possible,

879
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,440
- unless...
- Speak plainly.

880
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,440
It is the recommendation of many
that you asked to be removed...

881
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,680
from your post as Great Elector.

882
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:33,400
Thereby making yourself eligible
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

883
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,960
Well, if it is God's will.

884
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,520
May His will be done.

885
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,240
Here! I hear someone.

886
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,160
Remove the lid.

887
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,960
Come on.

888
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,920
Signore, are you okay?

889
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,108
I know he is there.

890
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,148
Madam, it is necessary
that you remain quiet.

891
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,000
Don't tell me that I should remain calm.
I want to know what he will do.

892
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,400
Commander, here's Ms. Vetra.

893
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,400
Those journals are private property.
I demand that you return them to me.

894
01:19:43,452 --> 01:19:46,560
They're material evidence
in a Vatican investigation.

895
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,948
I am an Italian citizen.

896
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
My rights do not end just
because I crossed the other side.

897
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:56,000
This is not Italy.
It's not even Rome. It's the Vatican.

898
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,988
A country with its own laws.

899
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,520
And when those journals passed the
border, they became my property.

900
01:20:01,572 --> 01:20:03,240
I will give them back to you

901
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,680
when I've decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation.

902
01:20:06,732 --> 01:20:09,040
Do you have something to
hide, Commandante Richter?

903
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,880
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

904
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,880
If it were up to me,
it wouldn't be this way.

905
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,080
It's a sin to kill with pain.

906
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,480
It's a sin to kill
without reason, Father.

907
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,120
They made me a sinner.

908
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,560
Saint Theresa on fire.

909
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,920
Professor Langdon?

910
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,680
- What direction is that?
- West, I think.

911
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,720
"Across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

912
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,640
Piazza Barba Rini is here.
Saint Theresa is here.

913
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,680
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo,
the first altar of science?

914
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,080
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

915
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,480
Thank you.

916
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,720
St. Peter's is here.

917
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,080
We are here.

918
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,760
A church with water.

919
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,000
Wait. Wait, wait.

920
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,200
Across Rome.

921
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,120
The poem must mean it's
literally across Rome.

922
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,400
Professor Langdon.

923
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,160
Commander Richter has ordered me to
escort you to the Vatican immediately.

924
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:05,960
Piazza Navona. Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

925
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,160
"A-Cross" Rome.

926
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,240
Bernini's Four Rivers.

927
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,840
Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists
that I have to take you back immediately.

928
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,320
The Vatican is about to see its
fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

929
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,600
Now, look.

930
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,240
You can do as they say and
force me back to the Vatican,

931
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,840
where we can all mourn
his death together.

932
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,080
Or you can show me how real cops act

933
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:30,640
and take me to Piazza Navona,
where we still might be able to stop it.

934
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,280
Oh. By all means, let's talk it over.

935
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,240
In fourteen minutes,
he's going to be dead.

936
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,560
Okay. This way, Professor.

937
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,520
Yes, Padre?

938
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,720
At 11:15, if the church
is still in peril,

939
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,960
give the order to
evacuate the cardinals.

940
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,480
But with dignity.

941
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,200
Let them walk out into St. Peter's
Square with their heads held high.

942
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,280
We don't want the last
image of this church to be

943
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:14,400
of frightened old men
sneaking out the back door.

944
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,640
"Where the angels guide thee..."

945
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,240
There it is. There it is.

946
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,880
Professor, I know this fountain.
There is no angel.

947
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,360
The dove. The angel of peace.

948
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,520
And it's looking in what direction?

949
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,520
Uh... east, I think.

950
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,600
Professor, just wait here. Stay put.

951
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,320
Good evening. Can you help me?

952
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,160
I need a doctor.

953
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,040
Come here.

954
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,240
Calm down. Don't shoot.

955
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,120
Hey!

956
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,000
Help! Somebody help!

957
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,200
Help! Somebody!

958
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,720
Cardinal Baja.

959
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,640
Cardinal Baja.

960
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,360
Si?

961
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,160
Where was he hiding you?

962
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,920
The Church of Illumination.
Where is it?

963
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,760
Castel Sant'Angelo.

964
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,080
Castle of the Angel.

965
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,720
Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baja.

966
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,800
The cardinal told Langdon he was
being held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

967
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,640
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

968
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,880
- Send everyone we can spare.
- And you?

969
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,480
I'm staying here.

970
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,720
Vittoria.

971
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,880
- You're all right?
- I'm all right, yes. What about you?

972
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:01,680
I just heard about
Olivetti on the radio.

973
01:29:01,732 --> 01:29:02,640
I'm all right. I'm okay.

974
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,560
Robert, we can't trust Richter.

975
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,668
He took Silvano's journals.

976
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,200
There must be something in
there he doesn't want us to see.

977
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,360
The head of the Swiss Guard.

978
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,480
From the Castel Sant'Angelo.
It's close enough so the wireless signal

979
01:29:20,532 --> 01:29:22,200
from that camera
could still reach the Vatican.

980
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:26,840
The Church of Illumination
is somewhere here

981
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,400
and your canister is inside it.

982
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,600
Come with me.

983
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,788
For 400 years, the Illuminati
met right under the Church's nose.

984
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,000
The Vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies.

985
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,560
If the explosion happens here, would
the blast radius take out the Vatican?

986
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,320
And part of Rome along with it.

987
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,280
They're pointing to it. The angels.

988
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,320
The container must be down there.
Come on!

989
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,720
- Where are they going?
- Back to search the other castle.

990
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,800
No, no. It has to be here!

991
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,000
Robert, it's a dead end.

992
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,640
No, it's not.

993
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,160
See if you can find a flashlight.

994
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,160
All of these stones
are rectangular granite.

995
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,600
Except right here. What is this?

996
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,480
It's a pentagram.

997
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,840
An eye...

998
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,840
that leads to...

999
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:03,000
Nowhere.

1000
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,360
Robert?

1001
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,280
These walls overlap and
there's a passageway in here.

1002
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,720
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

1003
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,240
It's a passageway that
leads to the Vatican.

1004
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,760
An ancient escape route.

1005
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,440
Oh, God.

1006
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,440
Here.

1007
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,760
Look.

1008
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,508
Get on the radio.

1009
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,428
Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

1010
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,440
The Camerlengo gave the
order for evacuation at-

1011
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,000
I'm counter-manning it.

1012
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,800
This is it. This is their church.

1013
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,800
The canister should be
lit by artificial light.

1014
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,000
It's not here, Robert.

1015
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,360
"The shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

1016
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,520
It's not here.

1017
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,840
What's the poem say?
- Nothing.

1018
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,880
Nothing. It's all over.
There was just four lines,

1019
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,000
each one describing...

1020
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,680
There's a fifth brand.

1021
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,760
It's not an ambigram.
It's just two crossed keys.

1022
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,640
- The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

1023
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,800
No, the papacy.
They intend to kill him.

1024
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,028
Before they destroy the Vatican,

1025
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,000
they're going to brand
and kill the pope himself.

1026
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:51,760
There is no pope.

1027
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,640
"Tempo Sede Vacante."

1028
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,880
The Camerlengo.

1029
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,760
- We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

1030
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,520
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

1031
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,400
Throw it in the fire.

1032
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,588
Murderer.

1033
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,600
You know, when they call me,

1034
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,308
and they all call me,

1035
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:25,908
it is so important to them

1036
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,520
that I know that what they
ask is the Lord's will.

1037
01:35:29,572 --> 01:35:32,640
Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's.

1038
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,840
And I suppose they're right.

1039
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,360
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now, would I?

1040
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,080
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

1041
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,400
You're still alive
because you have no weapon.

1042
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,908
And they didn't ask me to kill you.

1043
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,120
But if you pursue me,
it is another matter.

1044
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,280
Be careful.

1045
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,440
These are men of God.

1046
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,080
The Camerlengo.

1047
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,520
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1048
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,480
Here. Here.

1049
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:03,400
- I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

1050
01:38:03,452 --> 01:38:05,680
- I demand to see the Camerlengo!
- He is not available.

1051
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,760
We'll see about that.

1052
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,600
Oh. It's a chiusa chiave.
It's a one way portal.

1053
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,800
The only entrance is on the other side.

1054
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,440
No. Hey! Help!

1055
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,920
This is Robert Langdon and
Dr. Vetra. Open the door.

1056
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,680
The Camerlengo is in danger.

1057
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,400
He's the one. He's got a gun.

1058
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,120
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1059
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,360
Illuminatus!

1060
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,920
You bastard!

1061
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,720
Padre?

1062
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:27,240
Order the evacuation.
We only have nineteen minutes.

1063
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,600
Here. He's...

1064
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,000
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

1065
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:35,680
Yes, sir.

1066
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,920
Robert?

1067
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,840
The brand, the symbol.
Could it have another meaning?

1068
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:02,400
Crossed keys,
but those were upside down.

1069
01:40:02,452 --> 01:40:04,000
St. Peter.

1070
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,680
The first pope...

1071
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,588
...was crucified upside down.
- On Vatican Hill.

1072
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,520
- A few hundred feet below us.
- Necropolis. City of the dead.

1073
01:40:13,572 --> 01:40:16,160
"Upon this rock, I
will build my church."

1074
01:40:16,212 --> 01:40:18,680
"Or bring it down upon itself."

1075
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,680
The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb.

1076
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,588
The grid is still cycling.

1077
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,560
The power to this section must be down.

1078
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:29,000
It must be here. It must be.

1079
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,960
Don't touch it.

1080
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,040
We have seven minutes.

1081
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,120
Robert, hold this.

1082
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,880
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1083
01:42:33,932 --> 01:42:35,240
What's wrong?

1084
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,880
Cold decreases battery life.

1085
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:43,200
- We may have less than five minutes.
- So?

1086
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,120
If I pull the power with
less than five minutes...

1087
01:42:46,172 --> 01:42:49,080
the residual charge
won't hold suspension.

1088
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,080
We should leave it here
and get clear if we can.

1089
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:53,280
At least down here the damage-

1090
01:42:53,332 --> 01:42:54,600
No!

1091
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,520
- No. Wait!
- Father!

1092
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,028
We are live here at
St. Peter's Square...

1093
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:05,400
where, despite a bomb threat,
and an orderly evacuation,

1094
01:43:05,452 --> 01:43:08,028
the crowd is actually growing in size.

1095
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,880
As we await an official announcement
from the Vatican spokesman

1096
01:43:10,932 --> 01:43:12,908
as to the exact nature of the threat

1097
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,960
and whether or not they are
treating it as a credible danger...

1098
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,000
This way!

1099
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,400
He's got a bomb with him.

1100
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,680
A bomb?

1101
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,520
Roberto, this is an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1102
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,280
He's got clearance.

1103
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,360
Oh, my God.

1104
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,560
Get down!

1105
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,160
Cardinal Strauss?

1106
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,520
It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.

1107
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:31,240
He has saved the Church
and he's still alive.

1108
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,600
Praise God. Praise God.

1109
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,120
He is alive.

1110
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:44,360
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1111
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,360
You know the worst thing
we thought would happen

1112
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,840
was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.

1113
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:23,280
We thought we could change the world.

1114
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:27,960
- So naive.
- No, not naive.

1115
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,560
Innocent, maybe.

1116
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,240
But it's not a crime.

1117
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,080
I'm not so sure.

1118
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,920
Go back to work.

1119
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,680
Change the world.

1120
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:08,400
A gift, uh, you understand?
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.

1121
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,240
The Carmelengo's age
shouldn't influence the decision.

1122
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,220
Signori, you are no doubt
aware that by Holy Law

1123
01:51:14,272 --> 01:51:17,000
the man is inelligible
for election to the papacy.

1124
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,320
He's not a cardinal.
He's a priest.

1125
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:20,600
He's of insufficient age.

1126
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,680
Or maybe there's a way we
could consider the possibility.

1127
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:27,840
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1128
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,840
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1129
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,600
But, signore, you
would not hold a ballot.

1130
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:37,200
Surely, you remember? You gave
up your post as Great Elector.

1131
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,080
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

1132
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,880
Now, what happened here
tonight transcends our laws.

1133
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,360
Has it? Is it God's will that
we give ourselves over to frenzy?

1134
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,880
Discard the rules of the Church?

1135
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:51,120
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1136
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:57,760
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

1137
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,880
- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly.

1138
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,600
Yes. If the Holy Spirit
speaks through us,

1139
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,040
and we call a man's name out loud...

1140
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,960
That is election by adoration.

1141
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:11,240
- Yes.
- He's God's choice.

1142
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:17,240
Yes. And the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy,

1143
01:52:17,292 --> 01:52:21,320
present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

1144
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,308
- Signor Camerlengo?
- Yes?

1145
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,840
The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.

1146
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:01,440
- Me?
- Yes, Padre.

1147
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,960
What are you doing?

1148
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,360
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1149
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,040
Richter said...

1150
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,680
His Holiness suffered from seizures

1151
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:00,200
and steps were taken...

1152
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:02,320
for safety.

1153
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,880
He made sure he was watched, he said.

1154
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,880
What if he were trying
to give me this key?

1155
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,040
That's the Papal office.

1156
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,308
If the Pope was worried about seizures,

1157
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,280
he must've had Richter install
cameras without telling anyone.

1158
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:25,120
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

1159
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,880
Maybe it records.

1160
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:43,560
- I read the journals, Patrick.
- The scientist kept journals. So?

1161
01:54:43,612 --> 01:54:46,920
- You figure prominently in them.
- Really?

1162
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:51,560
The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.

1163
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:56,400
As such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work

1164
01:54:56,452 --> 01:54:58,440
and in need of spiritual guidance.

1165
01:54:58,492 --> 01:55:00,200
Like Galileo.

1166
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,788
About a month ago,

1167
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,200
he requested an
audience with the Pope.

1168
01:55:05,252 --> 01:55:06,120
But you know that,

1169
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,600
cause you granted the audience and
you were also present during it.

1170
01:55:09,652 --> 01:55:12,708
The 'God Particle'. To actually
claim an act of creation.

1171
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:17,160
- The blasphemy. The arrogance.
- The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

1172
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:19,308
He urged him to go public.

1173
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,080
His Holiness thought that
the discovery could actually

1174
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:25,380
scientifically prove the
existence of a divine power.

1175
01:55:25,432 --> 01:55:28,600
And begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1176
01:55:28,652 --> 01:55:31,200
His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.

1177
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:32,040
But you...

1178
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:36,680
You saw the pope's position
as a softening of church law.

1179
01:55:36,732 --> 01:55:40,480
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1180
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,420
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

1181
01:55:42,472 --> 01:55:44,320
He raised me to
protect this Church,

1182
01:55:44,372 --> 01:55:45,920
even from within.

1183
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:52,240
Then you conjured up an old enemy
from the past. The Illuminati.

1184
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:54,800
You found the ancient brands
in the papal vaults

1185
01:55:54,852 --> 01:55:57,326
and put them to use
to spread fear!

1186
01:55:57,378 --> 01:55:59,800
The Cardinals are men of belief.

1187
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,800
Right now, their belief
in evil is uniting them.

1188
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,800
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

1189
01:56:06,852 --> 01:56:08,400
There is no attack.

1190
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,600
You're trying to convince the
Cardinals they're in a war,

1191
01:56:12,652 --> 01:56:14,440
so they will choose a
warrior to lead them.

1192
01:56:14,492 --> 01:56:15,828
We are at war.

1193
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,868
We're weak when we should be strong.

1194
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,800
If science is allowed to
claim the power of creation,

1195
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,600
what is left for God?

1196
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:25,560
It didn't work, Patrick.

1197
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:29,200
- It isn't finished.
- Oh yes, it's finished.

1198
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,880
It's finished.

1199
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,440
I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.

1200
01:56:36,492 --> 01:56:38,886
The moment the doors
to the Conclave open,

1201
01:56:38,938 --> 01:56:41,280
he will tell the Cardinals
what you've done.

1202
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,400
I was planning on doing this alone.

1203
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,840
Put it down.

1204
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:53,880
But, perhaps,
it's better that you're here.

1205
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:55,320
Put it down.

1206
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,960
Put it away.

1207
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:13,600
Help. He's the one.
He's got a gun.

1208
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,680
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1209
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:20,800
Illuminatus!

1210
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,960
You bastard!

1211
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,160
Padre.

1212
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:40,240
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

1213
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:32,200
I've been summoned by
the College of Cardinals.

1214
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,560
Gently.

1215
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,240
But within our walls.

1216
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,840
He's on your side.

1217
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:50,080
Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.

1218
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:42,560
Church sources now confirm that
Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna,

1219
02:01:42,612 --> 02:01:46,600
has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall...

1220
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:51,880
The Catholic church thanks
Camerlengo for his selfless act

1221
02:01:51,932 --> 02:01:54,360
and demands his
immediate canonization.

1222
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:57,320
The Vatican has also confirmed
the deaths of three Cardinals

1223
02:01:57,372 --> 02:01:59,440
and the fire in the
Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1224
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:03,840
As we await the appearance of the new
Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy,

1225
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,520
one of the four original Preferiti,

1226
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,160
who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption

1227
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:09,708
seems to have been selected

1228
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,840
in one of the swiftest and smoothest
conclaves in modern church history.

1229
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,680
Professor Langdon? Please.

1230
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,840
A token of thanks from His Holiness

1231
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,600
and from his new Camerlengo.

1232
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,840
We are grateful you saved his life.

1233
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,480
And it's our understanding
that you require this text

1234
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:54,960
to complete your scholary work.

1235
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:01,000
We ask only that in your
last grand testament

1236
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:03,880
you ensure it finds its way home.

1237
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:07,640
Of course.

1238
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,800
And when you write of us,

1239
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:12,600
and you will write of us,

1240
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,760
may I ask one thing?

1241
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,000
Do so gently.

1242
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,480
I'll try.

1243
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,480
Religion is flawed,

1244
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:25,920
but only because man is flawed.

1245
02:03:25,972 --> 02:03:28,680
All men, including this one.

1246
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,160
He chose the name Luke.

1247
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:50,880
There's been many Marks and Johns.

1248
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,840
Never a Luke.

1249
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,320
It said he was a doctor.

1250
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,320
It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.

1251
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,280
The world is in need of both.

1252
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,120
You'll counsel him wisely.

1253
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,760
I'm an old man.
I'll counsel him briefly.

1254
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:18,480
Mr. Langdon.

1255
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:28,200
Thanks be to God for sending
someone to protect this church.

1256
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:35,480
I don't believe He sent me, Father.

1257
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,120
Oh, my son.

1258
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,480
Of course He did.

1259
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:27,400
