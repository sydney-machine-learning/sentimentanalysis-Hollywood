1
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:37,498
Start simple.
Start with what you know is true.

2
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:42,392
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

3
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:45,929
I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped.

4
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:50,097
Peeta... Peeta was left behind.

5
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:55,502
Miss Everdeen?

6
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,186
You can't be in here.

7
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:02,112
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

8
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:06,813
You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

9
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:09,961
Just five more minutes.

10
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,564
No.

11
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,192
No, please, don't.
It's just five more...

12
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:20,694
Don't touch me! Don't!
No! No! Get off of me!

13
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,186
Finnick.

14
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,026
I wanted to go back
for Peeta and Johanna,

15
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,432
but I...

16
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,798
I couldn't move.

17
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:39,339
They have Annie, too. They took her.

18
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:44,562
She's...

19
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:46,947
She's in the Capitol.

20
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,520
I wish she was dead.

21
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:58,458
I wish they were all dead
and we were, too.

22
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:29,492
Miss Everdeen.

23
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:32,895
Colonel Boggs,
District 13's head of security.

24
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,866
I know you've been discharged, but President
Coin's requested to meet with you first.

25
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,934
Is there any news?

26
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:41,377
I'm just here to escort you.

27
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,072
We were always told
there was nothing left of 13.

28
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,908
Capitol bombed the surface to rubble.

29
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,243
But we're military,
so we learned to survive down here.

30
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:26,051
Preparing, training.

31
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,541
The war never stopped for us.

32
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:04,287
There she is. Our Girl on Fire.

33
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,157
Madam President,
may I present you with The Mockingjay.

34
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:11,127
What an honor it is to meet you.

35
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,765
You're a courageous young woman.
I know how disorienting this must be.

36
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:19,368
And I can't imagine what it's like to live
through the atrocities of those Games.

37
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:23,105
Katniss, President Alma Coin.

38
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:26,574
Please know how welcome you are.

39
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:31,687
I hope you'll find some comfort with us.
We've known loss in 13, too.

40
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:36,552
This is history.
Right here at this table.

41
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,826
I apologize. I wish you had
more time to recover, but unfortunately,

42
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:43,089
we don't have that luxury.
Please, have a seat.

43
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:47,052
Are you aware of what's happened?

44
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,966
When you fired your arrow
at the force field

45
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,570
you electrified the nation.

46
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,709
There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.

47
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,178
We believe that if we
keep this energy going

48
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,081
we can unify the districts
against the Capitol.

49
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,017
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,

50
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,120
we could be waiting another
75 years for this opportunity.

51
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,091
- Everyone in 13 is ready for this.
- What about Peeta? Is he alive?

52
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,828
I don't know. And I wish that I did.

53
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:22,264
But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

54
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:25,935
The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

55
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:29,472
But I know their system very well.

56
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:33,409
I managed to break through.
All we need now is the perfect message.

57
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,711
Katniss, here's what we need to do.

58
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,381
We need to show them that
The Mockingjay's alive and well

59
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,484
and willing to stand up
and join this fight.

60
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,489
'Cause we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.

61
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,587
The way you did.

62
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:53,996
So we're gonna shoot
a series of propaganda clips,

63
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,300
propos, I like to call them,
on The Mockingjay.

64
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,302
Spreads the word

65
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:02,071
that we're gonna stoke
the fire of this rebellion.

66
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,874
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

67
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,410
You left him there.

68
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,347
- You left Peeta in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...

69
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:13,248
Peeta was the one
who was supposed to live.

70
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,102
Miss Everdeen.

71
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:19,121
This revolution is about everyone.

72
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:23,123
It's about all of us.
And we need a voice.

73
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,826
Then you should've saved Peeta.

74
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,070
Maybe you should have
rescued the boy instead.

75
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,098
Oh, no.

76
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:44,513
No, listen to me.
No one else can do this but her.

77
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,878
This is not the girl you described.

78
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:52,488
Obviously, we need to make it personal.
Remind her who the real enemy is.

79
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:54,290
She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.

80
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,489
Unless she's forgotten.

81
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,959
There's explaining and there's showing.

82
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:03,598
Let her see what the Capitol did to 12.

83
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:07,768
She can't handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

84
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,671
This is the only choice you have.

85
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:15,110
People don't always show up the way
you want them to, Madam President.

86
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,922
But that anger, that anger-driven defiance,
that's what we want.

87
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:22,285
And we can redirect it.
We need to unite these people out there

88
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,888
that have been doing nothing but killing
each other in an arena for years.

89
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,957
We have to have a lightning rod.

90
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:32,728
They'll follow her.
She's the face of the revolution.

91
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,795
Let her see it. Let her go home.

92
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:39,332
Send her.

93
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,794
I can't believe
you're going through with this.

94
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,633
You can say "no."

95
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,434
I need to see it for myself.

96
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:15,735
This way.

97
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:16,329
13 swept everything top to bottom,
so you'd be safe.

98
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,669
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

99
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,503
Yeah. I'm sure.

100
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:29,142
We'll have our eyes on you from above.

101
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,874
Figures.

102
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:06,061
Hey!

103
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,994
Come on.

104
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:11,297
Don't you wanna see Prim?

105
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:16,401
There you go. You're breakin' my heart.

106
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,039
Egeria!

107
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,378
We need to fix these lines.

108
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,884
I won't say "rebels."

109
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:39,220
These are senseless acts of defiance.

110
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,087
And I won't legitimize them.

111
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:45,391
We'll call them "criminals."

112
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,698
"Radicals."

113
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:56,369
Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule.

114
00:15:57,238 --> 00:16:00,306
Never let them see you bleed.

115
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:04,822
Citizens,

116
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:10,682
tonight I address all of Panem as one.

117
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,756
<i>Since the Dark Days,</i>

118
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,960
<i>Panem has had an unprecedented
era of peace.</i>

119
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,463
<i>It is a peace built upon cooperation.</i>

120
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,525
<i>And a respect for law and order.</i>

121
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,303
<i>In the past weeks,
you have heard of sporadic violence</i>

122
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:33,608
<i>following the actions of a few
radicals in the Quarter Quell.</i>

123
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:37,446
<i>Those who choose this destructive path,</i>

124
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,948
<i>your actions are based
on a misunderstanding</i>

125
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:44,186
<i>of how we have survived. Together.</i>

126
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:46,487
<i>It is a contract.</i>

127
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:52,560
<i>Each district supplies the Capitol.
Like blood to a heart.</i>

128
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,133
<i>In return, the Capitol provides
order and security.</i>

129
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,969
<i>To refuse work</i>

130
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,906
<i>is to put the entire system in danger.</i>

131
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:08,610
<i>The Capitol is the beating
heart of Panem.</i>

132
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,981
<i>Nothing can survive without a heart.</i>

133
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,914
<i>The criminals that kneel before you</i>

134
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:19,521
<i>use symbols for the purpose of sedition.</i>

135
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:24,590
Which is why all images
of The Mockingjay are now forbidden.

136
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,997
Possessing them will be
considered treason.

137
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:31,463
Punishable by death.

138
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,067
Justice shall be served swiftly.

139
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:38,741
<i>Order shall be restored.</i>

140
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,688
<i>To those who ignore
the warnings of history,</i>

141
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:52,754
<i>prepare to pay the ultimate price.</i>

142
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:41,036
It's okay. We're okay.

143
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:43,304
We're all here now.

144
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:45,003
Buttercup!

145
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,489
I smuggled him in.

146
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,113
I got Dad.

147
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,785
And I got some of your herbs
from the kitchen.

148
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,658
They have strict rules.

149
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,248
I don't know what they'll do
if they find him here.

150
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:24,014
You should try to eat something.

151
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,626
<i>Hello. Good evening.</i>

152
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:41,930
<i>And a big welcome to all in Panem.</i>

153
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,168
<i>I'm Caesar Flickerman. And whoever
you are, whatever it is you're doing,</i>

154
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,904
<i>if you're working, put down your work.
If you're having dinner, stop having dinner.</i>

155
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:54,409
<i>Because you are going to want
to witness this tonight.</i>

156
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:59,782
<i>There has been rampant speculation about
what really happened in the Quarter Quell.</i>

157
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:04,586
<i>And here to shed a little light on the
subject for us is a very special guest.</i>

158
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:09,256
<i>Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.</i>

159
00:20:09,356 --> 00:20:11,359
<i>Peeta, a lot of people</i>

160
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,629
<i>feel as though they are in the dark.</i>

161
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,265
<i>Yeah, I know how they feel.</i>

162
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,134
<i>Now, so set the stage for us.</i>

163
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:22,237
<i>Talk us through what really happened</i>

164
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,906
<i>on that final and controversial night.</i>

165
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:29,812
<i>Well, first off, you have to understand
that when you're in the Games</i>

166
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,215
<i>- you only get one wish. It's very costly.</i>
- You're alive.

167
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:36,618
<i>- It costs your life.
- I think it costs more than your life.</i>

168
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:38,153
<i>How do you mean?
What's more than your life?</i>

169
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:42,590
<i>I mean to murder innocent people,
that costs everything that you are.</i>

170
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,925
<i>Yes.</i>

171
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:47,629
<i>So you hold on to that one wish.</i>

172
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:50,398
<i>And that night my wish
was to save Katniss.</i>

173
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,866
<i>Yes.</i>

174
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,803
<i>I should've just run off with her
earlier in the day like she'd wanted.</i>

175
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:59,941
<i>But you didn't. Why?
Were you caught up in Beetee's plan?</i>

176
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:03,744
<i>No, I was caught up
trying to play allies.</i>

177
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:06,454
<i>And then they separated us and...</i>

178
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,181
<i>that's when I lost her.</i>

179
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:12,987
<i>And then the lightning hit...</i>

180
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,858
<i>and the whole force field
around the arena just blew out.</i>

181
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:22,051
<i>Yes, but, Peeta,
Katniss is the one who blew it out.</i>

182
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:23,498
<i>- No.
- You saw the footage.</i>

183
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:26,167
<i>No, she didn't know what she was doing.</i>

184
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:29,804
<i>Neither of us knew there was a
bigger plan going on. We had no idea.</i>

185
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,068
<i>- You had no idea?
- No.</i>

186
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:36,011
<i>All right. Well, Peeta, there are many
who find this suspicious to say the least.</i>

187
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:40,382
<i>It seems as though
she was part of a rebel plan.</i>

188
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:44,186
<i>Do you think it was part of her plan
to be almost killed by Johanna?</i>

189
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,955
<i>Or part of the plan to be
paralyzed by lightning?</i>

190
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,293
<i>No, we were not part of any rebel plan.
We had no idea what was going on.</i>

191
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:55,363
<i>All right. I believe you,
Peeta Mellark. Thank you.</i>

192
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:56,289
<i>Yeah.</i>

193
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,700
<i>And I was going to ask you
to speak about the unrest</i>

194
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,704
<i>- but I think you might be too upset.
- No, I can.</i>

195
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,406
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

196
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,368
<i>- Thank you.
- Yeah.</i>

197
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:14,049
<i>I want everyone who's watching to stop</i>

198
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:17,452
<i>and to think about
what a civil war could mean.</i>

199
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:22,246
<i>We almost went extinct once before.
And now our numbers are even fewer.</i>

200
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:23,992
- He's one of them.
<i>- Is this really what we wanna do?</i>

201
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,794
- He's a traitor.
<i>- Kill ourselves off?</i>

202
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:30,499
- <i>Killing is not the answer.</i>
- I can't believe he's doing this.

203
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,901
<i>Everyone needs to lay down
their weapons immediately.</i>

204
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:35,870
- Traitor!
- He's not one of us!

205
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,739
This is treason!

206
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:41,006
<i>Are you calling for a ceasefire?</i>

207
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:43,077
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

208
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:45,213
- You're a puppet!
- Hang him!

209
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:49,017
<i>I want everyone to stop
the senseless violence.</i>

210
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,287
- <i>This is not the path to change.</i>
- Traitor!

211
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:55,296
<i>It's not the path to justice.</i>

212
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:20,679
There can't be a ceasefire.

213
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,383
Not after everything Snow's done.

214
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,821
He could have done
a lot of damage tonight.

215
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:31,559
Most districts, people are still too afraid
to join. They need the courage.

216
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,445
Why do you think he said that?

217
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:37,728
I don't know. Maybe he was forced.

218
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:45,003
He didn't look that bad.

219
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:49,540
Maybe he made some kind
of deal to protect you.

220
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,861
He's still playing the game.

221
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:05,690
No! No! No!

222
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:14,236
I'm sorry. It's just a nightmare.

223
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,902
That's okay. I get 'em, too.

224
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:21,907
Peeta,

225
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:25,595
will you stay with me?

226
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:27,779
Yeah.

227
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,778
Always.

228
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,868
Hey.

229
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,803
Can't sleep?

230
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:13,757
Tell me what's happening.

231
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:18,172
I'm good at keeping secrets.
Even from Mom.

232
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:26,905
No one hates the Capitol more than me.

233
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:32,576
And I wanna help.
But I just keep thinking,

234
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:37,075
even if we win this war,
what happens to Peeta?

235
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:41,756
I know he's not safe there,
but he's definitely not safe here.

236
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:45,793
I don't think you know
how important you are to them.

237
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:49,628
If you want something,
you just have to ask.

238
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:53,400
You could demand almost anything.

239
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,271
They'd have to agree to it.

240
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,138
I should wake you up
more often, Little Duck.

241
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,175
Get some sleep now.

242
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:06,080
You, too.

243
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:14,689
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

244
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,059
I've decided I'll be your Mockingjay.

245
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,693
But I have some conditions.

246
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:31,606
Peeta and the other Tributes,
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta,

247
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:34,208
will be rescued
at the earliest opportunity.

248
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:39,113
If and when Peeta is liberated, he will
receive a full and unconditional pardon.

249
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:44,214
No punishment will be inflicted.
And the same goes for the other Tributes.

250
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:49,045
No.

251
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:52,627
It's not their fault
you abandoned them in the arena.

252
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,028
They're doing and saying
whatever they can to survive.

253
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:57,699
Individuals don't make demands in 13.

254
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,535
There will be a tribunal.
And a fair judgment.

255
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:03,202
Thank you.

256
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:06,307
The Victors will be granted immunity.

257
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,878
And you will announce that
in front of the entire population of 13.

258
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:12,647
You will hold yourself
and your government responsible

259
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,116
or you will find another Mockingjay.

260
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,553
That's it. That's her. Right there.

261
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:22,424
Isn't that who I promised you?
She wears the costume.

262
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:25,093
Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

263
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:26,925
Our Mockingjay.

264
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:31,766
Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

265
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,802
This is worth the risk.
She's worth the risk.

266
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:37,372
Pardons, tribunals. Power of the people.

267
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:40,842
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

268
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:45,877
in wartime I think even the noblest of
causes can be bent a little bit. Right?

269
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,418
Do you have any other conditions?

270
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,559
My sister gets to keep her cat.

271
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:17,196
Go away.

272
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:23,915
Is it visiting hours again?

273
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:26,818
Miss Trinket,

274
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,224
you see this door.

275
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:33,027
It opens. From the inside.

276
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:36,865
I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

277
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:40,700
You're not a prisoner.
You're free to join the rest of 13.

278
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,206
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

279
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,308
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

280
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:50,178
Katniss has agreed to be The Mockingjay.

281
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:54,382
- That poor thing.
- And your Girl on Fire is burnt out.

282
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,948
I need you to join this team now.

283
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,688
- I need someone she trusts.
- What about Haymitch?

284
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:03,658
He's drying out in some
facility a mile down.

285
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,227
Aiding rebels is not really my forte.

286
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:12,033
Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,

287
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,404
no matter what happens here.

288
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,872
If you wanna play
a prisoner of war, fine.

289
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:22,141
Stay here and rot. I'll find someone else
to be The Mockingjay's escort.

290
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,343
Who?

291
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,416
Anyone can be replaced.

292
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:34,619
Not your Mockingjay.

293
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:40,225
There isn't a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

294
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:47,868
You honestly believe one of these
cave dwellers is going to take my place?

295
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:49,634
No.

296
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,987
Good afternoon.

297
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:10,205
Thank you for interrupting
your schedules.

298
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,528
They have already been
adjusted to compensate...

299
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:15,630
I hardly ever see children around here.

300
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,431
Please, check in with your unit...

301
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:20,668
A lot of them were lost
in an epidemic a few years ago.

302
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:23,937
- I have an announcement for the citizens of 13.
- Coin lost her family, too.

303
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:25,606
Daughter and a husband.

304
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:28,342
And our welcome guests from 12.

305
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:32,847
Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause

306
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:36,950
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

307
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:42,756
In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.

308
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:47,996
First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

309
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,848
held hostage in the Capitol.

310
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:52,965
Peeta Mellark,

311
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,005
Johanna Mason...

312
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:02,373
- Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.
- ...and Annie Cresta.

313
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:07,048
Once freed, they will be granted
full pardon for any and all crimes

314
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:09,867
committed against the rebel cause.

315
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,520
Good.

316
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,186
That's good, Katniss.

317
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:20,695
If Katniss Everdeen
fails to fulfill her duties

318
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:22,763
the deal will be off.

319
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:27,932
Thank you for your attention.
Please, resume your daily schedules.

320
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:33,724
- Madam President.
- Effie Trinket.

321
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,359
Welcome to 13.

322
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:38,594
Madam President,
may I say you are so very...

323
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:41,071
concise.

324
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,333
You believe that
there's more to be said?

325
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:47,271
- May I speak freely?
- You don't appear to do anything else.

326
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:50,874
I'm only talking about salesmanship.

327
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:54,045
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

328
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:58,950
They need to be nurtured
with a little kindling and warmth.

329
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,191
- Bit of oxygen.
- Oxygen.

330
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,789
One sure way to put it out
is to smother it.

331
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,701
Or to use up all the air in the room.

332
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,390
Excuse me.

333
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:15,530
You know what could use
a revolution? That hair.

334
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:17,833
Effie?

335
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:26,845
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a political refugee.

336
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,616
- Plutarch rescued you?
- Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.

337
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,452
You and I were both in the dark.

338
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,955
Now I'm condemned
to this life of jumpsuits.

339
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,659
It is wonderful to see you again.

340
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:45,737
Can you believe this place?

341
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:48,625
I miss coffee.

342
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:53,491
I never knew anyplace
could be so strict. I mean,

343
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:56,337
I thought at least
in the higher ranks there'd be some...

344
00:32:57,406 --> 00:33:01,178
side action. I miss my wigs.

345
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,949
Luckily, I remembered that this was
all the rage when I was coming up.

346
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,582
You know, everything old
can be made new again.

347
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:11,345
Like democracy.

348
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:15,090
Which brings me to this.

349
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,166
Cinna.

350
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:29,370
He's dead, isn't he?

351
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,142
Yes, dear.

352
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:40,651
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

353
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:43,785
until you'd decided to be
The Mockingjay on your own.

354
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:48,789
He knew the risks. As we all do.

355
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,628
He believed in this revolution.

356
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:56,800
He believed in you.

357
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,967
They're beautiful.

358
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:05,706
They have it.
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

359
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:12,446
There's not much of a prep team
here in 13 but we will make you

360
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:15,584
the best-dressed rebel in history.

361
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:21,119
Okay.

362
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:23,509
Bring up the lights.

363
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,378
Cinna's final touch.

364
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:53,223
Everyone's either gonna wanna kiss you,
kill you, or be you.

365
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:55,322
Perfect.

366
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:57,094
Absolutely perfect.

367
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,895
Okay. Let's bring up the setting.

368
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,823
Little wind.

369
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:12,410
Okay, Katniss, we're gonna
start you down on one knee.

370
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,882
And as you rise up, you're gonna hold
your flag in the air and deliver your line.

371
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,786
And remember you've just stormed
the outskirts of the Capitol

372
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,921
arm-in-arm with your
brothers and sisters.

373
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,219
Okay.

374
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,362
Whenever you're ready.

375
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:35,596
People of Panem,
we fight, we dare, we...

376
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:38,869
Does she know the line?

377
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,471
- I know it. I got it. I'm sorry.
- Okay, All right.

378
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,440
- Let's do it again.
- She's warming up.

379
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,343
All right. With energy. Go.

380
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:51,883
People of Panem, we fight!
We dare to end this hunger for justice!

381
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,452
You've just been in battle!

382
00:35:54,552 --> 00:36:00,121
I'm sorry. Excuse my outburst.
You've just been in battle.

383
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:03,758
Let's try it again.
Whenever you're ready.

384
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,697
People of Panem, we fight!

385
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:12,167
We dare to end this hunger for justice.

386
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:26,746
And that, my friends,
is how a revolution dies.

387
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:32,153
Hello, Katniss.

388
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:37,358
This how you greet an old friend?

389
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:40,695
Maybe I don't recognize you sober.

390
00:36:42,164 --> 00:36:45,399
I guess it looks as bad as it feels.

391
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,507
<i>People of Panem, we fight!</i>

392
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:54,175
<i>We dare! We end this hunger for justice!</i>

393
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,290
Madam President,

394
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,960
indulge me for a moment, if you would.

395
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,765
Let's everybody think of one incident where
Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you.

396
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:20,071
Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle
or her dress went up in flames

397
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,107
or she made a halfway
decent shot with an arrow.

398
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,810
And not where Peeta made you like her.

399
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:32,547
No, I'd like you all to think of one moment
where she made you feel something real.

400
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:37,655
When she volunteered
for her sister at the Reaping.

401
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,588
Excellent example.

402
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,264
Okay.

403
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,288
I hope that wasn't important.

404
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,566
Okay. "Volunteer for sister."

405
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,719
Good. What else?

406
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:54,938
When she sang that song for little Rue.

407
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:58,209
Oh, yeah.
Who didn't get choked up at that?

408
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,044
You know, I like you better, Effie,
without all that makeup.

409
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:03,477
Well, I like you better sober.

410
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,883
When she chose Rue as an ally, as well.

411
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:10,954
- Yes.
- Now, what do all these have in common?

412
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:13,256
No one told her what to do.

413
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:17,027
Unscripted, yes. So maybe
we should just leave her alone.

414
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,263
And wash her face.

415
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,699
She's still a girl.
You made her look 35.

416
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:26,837
The opportunities for spontaneity
are obviously lacking below ground.

417
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:31,242
So what you're suggesting
is we toss her into combat?

418
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,610
I can't sanction putting
an untrained civilian

419
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,448
in battle just for effect.
This is not the Capitol.

420
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,384
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
Put her in the field.

421
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,320
- No, we can't protect her.
- It has to come from her.

422
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,092
That's what people respond to.
You want a symbol for the revolution?

423
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,694
She cannot be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.

424
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,863
Maybe there's someplace
that's less dangerous.

425
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,900
District 8. They reported heavy bombing
last week. There are no military targets left.

426
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,087
- We can't guarantee her safety.
- You'll never be able to guarantee my safety.

427
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:04,706
- I wanna go.
- And if you're killed?

428
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:07,976
Make sure you get it on camera.

429
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:14,348
I've made you some surprises.

430
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,189
Maybe you wanna try one out.

431
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:27,128
If you're gonna be a part of Katniss'
propo team, you may as well look the part.

432
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,012
And this one is for you.

433
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:51,137
Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon
for the sake of the propos but...

434
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:54,264
I couldn't just make you
a fashion accessory.

435
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,293
It's beautiful.

436
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:02,797
And look here.

437
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:12,576
Regular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows.
All color-coded.

438
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:16,547
And tell Finnick

439
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:20,348
I've got a trident for him
when he's ready.

440
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:23,651
Might just cheer him... Cheer him up.

441
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,790
Let's not fire the red ones in here.

442
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:51,679
You had all of this and you just left
the districts to fend for themselves?

443
00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:55,886
It's not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.

444
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,956
We weren't in any kind of shape
to launch a counterattack.

445
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,392
Yeah, we could've bombed the Capitol
but they would've retaliated

446
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,365
with at least twice the firepower.
Then what?

447
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,632
There would've been nobody
left to claim victory.

448
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:13,000
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said
and then you all called him a traitor.

449
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,138
This way, soldier.

450
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:20,975
You are camera-ready.

451
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:25,578
Doesn't your comrade look handsome?

452
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,601
Let's go.

453
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,583
Come back safe.

454
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:37,393
Quick introductions, Katniss.

455
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:40,931
These people have come a long way
to support the cause. This is Cressida.

456
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,235
In my opinion one of the best
up-and-coming directors in the Capitol.

457
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,038
- Until I up and left. Hey.
- Hey.

458
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:51,346
Let's see what you can do. Be careful.

459
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:55,512
- This is my assistant, Messalla.
- It's an honor to meet you.

460
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:58,716
- And your cameramen over there, Castor.
- Hello.

461
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,515
And Pollux.

462
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,784
Let's get locked in.

463
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:13,896
You're all from the Capitol?
Plutarch got you out?

464
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:16,166
Don't expect much chitchat from him.

465
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:19,970
He's an Avox.
Capitol cut his tongue out years ago.

466
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,204
And no, it wasn't any sort of rescue,
if that's what you mean.

467
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,179
We all fled on our own.

468
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,079
For this. For you.

469
00:43:02,645 --> 00:43:05,427
This has gotta be fast. In and out.

470
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:24,895
Move out.

471
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:38,449
You're alive then. We weren't sure.

472
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,684
Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.

473
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,585
Katniss has been recovering,
but she insisted on coming out

474
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:45,253
- and seein' some of your wounded.
- Well, we've got plenty of those.

475
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:58,000
We have a mass grave
a few blocks west, but,

476
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,003
I can't spare the manpower
to move them yet.

477
00:44:01,103 --> 00:44:03,140
Hospital's past that curtain.

478
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,541
Any hope you can give them,
it's worth it.

479
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:08,579
The Capitol's done everything
they can to break us.

480
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,248
Aren't you worried about having
all your wounded in one place?

481
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,948
I think it's better
than leaving them to die.

482
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:17,521
- That's not what I meant.
- Well, that's my only other option.

483
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,654
If you can come up with another,
I'm all ears.

484
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:22,922
It's right through here.

485
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:38,739
Don't film me in there.
I can't help them.

486
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:42,209
Just let them see your face.

487
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,827
Excuse me.

488
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,635
- Yeah.
- You all right?

489
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,073
It's okay. Here, it's okay.

490
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:12,547
I've got you. I've got you.
It's all right.

491
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:44,972
Katniss Everdeen?

492
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,643
What are you doing here?

493
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:54,334
I came... I came to see you.

494
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:57,685
What about the baby?

495
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:06,342
- I lost it.
- Are you fighting, Katniss?

496
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:10,447
You here to fight with us?

497
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,234
I am.

498
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:16,370
I will.

499
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:37,509
Tighter.

500
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:39,993
Tighter, tighter.

501
00:46:48,103 --> 00:46:51,675
Sir, some cameras
were damaged in the bombings,

502
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,576
but we confirmed it's her.

503
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,346
Zoom in.

504
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:11,425
She was visiting a makeshift hospital.
We're not sure if she's still there.

505
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:17,534
We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.

506
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,210
We may be able to target her.

507
00:47:22,038 --> 00:47:23,450
Kill the wounded.

508
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,284
Sir...

509
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:29,309
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.

510
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:33,216
Any association with
the Mockingjay symbol

511
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:35,477
is forbidden.

512
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:39,954
Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.

513
00:47:41,757 --> 00:47:46,497
Show them what it costs
to be friends with Katniss Everdeen.

514
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,566
Your mom's gonna be proud of you
when she sees the footage.

515
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:54,071
- Will this play in the districts?
- It'll be tattooed on their eyes.

516
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,508
- There's a problem.
- What kinda problem?

517
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,977
Incoming bombers from the north.

518
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,510
- We need to find cover now.
- There's a bunker in there.

519
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:18,892
Straight ahead and down the stairs.

520
00:48:20,296 --> 00:48:21,878
Katniss!

521
00:48:21,978 --> 00:48:23,497
Katniss!

522
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,299
Everdeen!

523
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:28,199
Everdeen!

524
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:30,238
Gale, back away from the wall!

525
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:47,866
You okay?

526
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,505
Move!

527
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:05,740
- They're going after something to the south.
- That's towards the hospital.

528
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:13,447
They're circling back around. Come on!

529
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:55,354
That's the hospital.
They're targeting the hospital.

530
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:51,147
Help them!

531
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:53,073
Help them! Get them out!

532
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,621
Katniss?

533
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,787
Katniss, can you tell everyone
what you're seeing right now?

534
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:06,560
Katniss, what do you wanna say?

535
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:19,808
I want the rebels
to know that I'm alive.

536
00:51:19,908 --> 00:51:22,012
That I'm in District 8

537
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,182
where the Capitol just bombed a hospital

538
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:29,686
filled with unarmed men,
women and children.

539
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:32,052
And there will be no survivors.

540
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:39,328
If you think for one second that
the Capitol will ever treat us fairly

541
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:41,531
you are lying to yourselves.

542
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:44,980
Because we know who they are
and what they do.

543
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,837
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.

544
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:57,547
I have a message for President Snow.

545
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:02,816
You can torture us and bomb us
and burn our districts to the ground.

546
00:52:03,952 --> 00:52:06,286
But do you see that?

547
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:09,433
Fire is catching.

548
00:52:09,824 --> 00:52:14,261
And if we burn, you burn with us!

549
00:52:34,816 --> 00:52:37,554
<i>We know who they are and what they do.</i>

550
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,457
<i>This is what they do!</i>

551
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,831
<i>And we must fight back.</i>

552
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:47,230
<i>You can torture us and bomb us</i>

553
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,833
<i>and burn our districts to the ground.</i>

554
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,701
Plutarch's faith in you
wasn't misplaced.

555
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,437
- <i>But do you see that?</i>
- Thank you.

556
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:57,374
- <i>Fire is catching.</i>
- Come up with me for the beginning.

557
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:01,464
<i>And if we burn, you burn with us!</i>

558
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:33,173
There is no progress without compromise.

559
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:36,909
No victory without sacrifice.

560
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:40,450
But I stand here with The Mockingjay

561
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,852
to announce that our moment has arrived.

562
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:14,928
Beetee has increased
our use of the airwaves tenfold.

563
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:19,222
We will broadcast this message
to all the districts tonight.

564
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:25,215
The Mockingjay's words inspiring
everyone to join the rebellion.

565
00:54:25,315 --> 00:54:28,965
Together, we will become

566
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,232
an alliance to be reckoned with.

567
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:36,105
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

568
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:43,110
You don't like hearing
a fight song at a funeral?

569
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,849
The more people on our side,
the closer we are to Peeta and Annie.

570
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:53,353
Yeah.

571
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:18,648
<i>By order of President Snow daily production
quotas have been increased.</i>

572
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:22,852
<i>All work shifts will be extended
by an extra two hours.</i>

573
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:26,820
<i>Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.</i>

574
00:55:27,055 --> 00:55:32,459
<i>By order of President Snow daily
production quotas have been increased.</i>

575
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:21,674
If we burn, you burn with us!

576
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:25,787
Yeah!

577
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,449
Yeah!

578
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:51,975
- I got good news.
- What?

579
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,841
Coin agreed to let us hunt above ground.

580
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:48,469
He's not even afraid of us.

581
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:52,565
It's 'cause they've
never been hunted before.

582
00:57:54,502 --> 00:57:56,670
It's almost not fair.

583
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,635
They want us back.

584
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,229
- They asked us to head for Command.
- All right. I gotta drop these off.

585
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,806
<i>She was arguably</i>

586
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,242
<i>our favorite Tribute.</i>

587
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:43,479
<i>And I think that's what
we all find most astonishing,</i>

588
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:48,682
<i>is that this girl was
adored in the Capitol.</i>

589
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:54,242
<i>And I think for you, Peeta,
it must be particularly painful.</i>

590
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,759
I wish I could give
this rose to you, Katniss.

591
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,062
He's changed so much already.
What are they doing to him?

592
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:04,087
<i>A sweet gesture for a girl
who has inspired such violence.</i>

593
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,102
<i>You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.</i>

594
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,271
- He's shaking.
- <i>I don't think that I could.</i>

595
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:12,008
<i>Unless, of course, Peeta,
you think that perhaps she's being</i>

596
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:17,377
<i>forced into saying things that
she doesn't even understand.</i>

597
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:21,617
<i>Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I think.</i>

598
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:25,822
- Even his voice is different.
<i>- I think they're using her to whip up the rebels.</i>

599
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,859
<i>I doubt she even knows what's happening.
And what's really at stake.</i>

600
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,867
<i>Now, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels
will ever let her see this.</i>

601
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,265
<i>But if they do,
what would you say to her?</i>

602
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:40,633
<i>To Katniss Everdeen, the once sweet
Katniss Everdeen. What would you say to her?</i>

603
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,539
<i>I would... I would tell her
to think for herself.</i>

604
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:45,285
<i>Yes.</i>

605
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:53,416
<i>Don't be a fool, Katniss.
I know you never wanted the rebellion.</i>

606
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:59,647
<i>The things that you did in the Games
were never intended to start all of this.</i>

607
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,525
<i>The rebels have made you
into something that you're not.</i>

608
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,861
<i>Something that could destroy all of us.</i>

609
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:08,798
<i>So if you have any power or any say</i>

610
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,831
<i>in what they do or how they use you,</i>

611
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:18,506
<i>please, please, urge them to stop
this war before it's too late.</i>

612
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:23,476
<i>And ask yourself, can you trust
the people you're working with?</i>

613
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,885
- <i>Do you know what they really want?</i>
- We need to respond.

614
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:34,424
<i>Thank you, Peeta Mellark, for these
revelations about the real Mockingjay.</i>

615
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,460
- Did you see what he looks like?
- I saw a coward.

616
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,087
- You don't have any idea what he's going through.
- I don't care.

617
01:01:40,187 --> 01:01:42,998
I would never say what he just said.

618
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:45,433
Not if they tortured me.
Not with a gun to my head.

619
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:48,503
That is the same Peeta that
defended you at the whipping post.

620
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:52,055
No, it's not.
Now he's only defending himself.

621
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,550
Coin's called a meeting.
We need to respond.

622
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:58,229
When did "we" become you and Coin?

623
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:01,459
Everyone has a choice.
How can he sit there in the Capitol

624
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,602
and defend the people who destroyed
his home and murdered his family?

625
01:02:05,702 --> 01:02:07,169
He doesn't know.

626
01:02:08,172 --> 01:02:12,654
How could he? Nobody's seen
what the Capitol did to 12.

627
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:14,878
I have to show them.

628
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:33,596
So I wanna start with you
in front of the Justice Building, okay?

629
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:39,536
Bang. First shot.

630
01:02:51,816 --> 01:02:54,473
Katniss, tell us what happened here.

631
01:02:57,422 --> 01:02:59,959
We were all standin' right here

632
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:06,462
watchin' the Games
when you fired that arrow.

633
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:11,853
The screens just went dark.
Nobody had any idea what happened.

634
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:16,009
Peacekeepers forced us
back into our homes.

635
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,776
For maybe an hour,
the town was just dead quiet.

636
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:25,749
Little past 9:00,
we heard their trucks pullin' out.

637
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:31,220
All of them. Every single Peacekeeper.

638
01:03:33,191 --> 01:03:35,290
And I knew what that meant.

639
01:03:39,264 --> 01:03:42,268
Me and a couple of guys from the mines,
we started pulling people from their houses

640
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:47,103
and tried to get 'em to the fence line but
a lotta people were scared of the forest.

641
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:52,108
So they headed up onto the road.
Make a break for it that way.

642
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,748
Stay with Gale.

643
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,256
915 of us made it to the fence.

644
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:13,645
Then we watched as...

645
01:04:14,209 --> 01:04:17,064
bombers circled back towards the road.

646
01:04:21,538 --> 01:04:24,407
They firebombed them as they ran away.

647
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:43,576
915 outta 10,000.

648
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:53,436
I should've grabbed people.
I should've dragged 'em with me.

649
01:04:55,306 --> 01:05:00,108
- Some of the kids I could've carried.
- You saved so many people, Gale.

650
01:05:00,678 --> 01:05:04,648
Without you, there would be no District 12.
Not even the memory of it.

651
01:05:37,414 --> 01:05:39,582
This is where you kissed me.

652
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:42,719
I didn't think you remembered that.

653
01:05:51,963 --> 01:05:54,831
I'd have to be dead to forget that.

654
01:05:56,868 --> 01:05:58,272
Maybe not even then.

655
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,884
I knew you'd do that.

656
01:06:15,853 --> 01:06:17,921
How? I didn't.

657
01:06:18,723 --> 01:06:20,889
'Cause I'm in pain.

658
01:06:23,962 --> 01:06:26,796
That's the only way
that I can get your attention.

659
01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:34,444
Don't worry, Katniss. It'll pass.

660
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:56,756
Hey.

661
01:07:06,504 --> 01:07:08,637
Yeah, that's a mockingjay.

662
01:07:23,788 --> 01:07:26,160
Well, now they'll never shut up.

663
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:32,896
You want me to sing?

664
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:47,072
<i>Are you, are you</i>

665
01:07:47,172 --> 01:07:49,240
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

666
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,216
<i>They strung up a man</i>

667
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:55,042
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

668
01:07:55,142 --> 01:08:00,076
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

669
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:05,302
<i>If we met at midnight
in the hanging tree</i>

670
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:08,829
<i>Are you, are you</i>

671
01:08:08,929 --> 01:08:11,378
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

672
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:17,005
<i>Where the dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

673
01:08:17,105 --> 01:08:22,134
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

674
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:27,881
<i>If we met at midnight
in the hanging tree</i>

675
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:30,825
<i>Are you, are you</i>

676
01:08:30,925 --> 01:08:33,264
<i>Coming to the tree</i>

677
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:35,625
<i>Where I told you to run</i>

678
01:08:35,923 --> 01:08:38,901
<i>So we'd both be free</i>

679
01:08:39,001 --> 01:08:44,019
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

680
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:49,654
<i>If we met at midnight
in the hanging tree</i>

681
01:08:57,616 --> 01:08:59,985
That line was originally
"necklace of rope."

682
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:02,454
I had it changed to "necklace of hope."

683
01:09:02,554 --> 01:09:05,457
Wow. You are a true wordsmith.

684
01:09:05,557 --> 01:09:08,026
Little on the nose, but,
of course, so is war.

685
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:12,028
- Every district's seeing this?
- Yes. But not the Capitol.

686
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:15,967
I designed this signal
defense system for them.

687
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:17,936
But I can't find my way through it.

688
01:09:18,436 --> 01:09:20,473
Guess I did my job too well.

689
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:24,106
At the time, I was just thinking
of the science of it all.

690
01:09:25,576 --> 01:09:27,565
We'll get through it.

691
01:11:57,661 --> 01:12:03,132
Moves and countermoves.

692
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:29,291
Katniss, you're wanted in Command.

693
01:12:36,934 --> 01:12:40,138
<i>Tonight, we've received reports</i>

694
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:42,307
<i>of derailed trains,</i>

695
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:44,410
<i>of granaries on fire,</i>

696
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:49,448
<i>and of a savage attack on the
hydroelectric dam in District 5.</i>

697
01:12:49,548 --> 01:12:51,516
What have they done to you?

698
01:12:51,616 --> 01:12:56,555
<i>I'm begging for restraint and decency.</i>

699
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:59,491
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled horse manure

700
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:01,990
to bring you...

701
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:09,058
- That's it. That's our footage.
- Beetee's in.

702
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:14,037
- Katniss?
- He sees it. He sees our propo.

703
01:13:17,641 --> 01:13:19,682
<i>- Katniss, are you there?</i>
- Peeta.

704
01:13:20,645 --> 01:13:22,511
<i>Katniss?</i>

705
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:27,603
<i>Peeta, please continue.</i>

706
01:13:28,652 --> 01:13:32,220
<i>You were telling us about
these savage attacks.</i>

707
01:13:32,623 --> 01:13:34,073
<i>Yeah.</i>

708
01:13:38,028 --> 01:13:41,259
<i>The attack on the dam</i>

709
01:13:41,559 --> 01:13:42,777
<i>was a callous</i>

710
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:47,470
<i>and inhuman act of destruction...</i>

711
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:56,214
<i>Think about it.</i>

712
01:13:56,648 --> 01:14:01,186
<i>How will this end? What will be left?</i>

713
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:03,219
<i>No one can survive this.</i>

714
01:14:04,455 --> 01:14:08,457
<i>No one is safe now.
Not here in the Capitol.</i>

715
01:14:09,393 --> 01:14:10,978
<i>Not in any of the districts.</i>

716
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:17,936
<i>They're coming, Katniss.
They're gonna kill everyone.</i>

717
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:20,231
<i>And in District 13
you'll be dead by morning.</i>

718
01:14:21,138 --> 01:14:24,743
- He's warning us. That was a warning.
- Yes, it was.

719
01:14:24,843 --> 01:14:26,299
We have to get him out
before they kill him.

720
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,947
- Is there anything in the air?
- Nothing on Doppler, ma'am.

721
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,782
He was in the mansion.
He could have overheard something.

722
01:14:30,882 --> 01:14:32,181
Possibly.

723
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:38,554
It's time for an air raid drill.

724
01:14:46,764 --> 01:14:52,935
<i>This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

725
01:14:55,005 --> 01:14:58,109
- Prim! Prim!
- <i>Proceed to your nearest stairwell</i>

726
01:14:58,209 --> 01:15:00,545
<i>and descend to level 40.</i>

727
01:15:00,645 --> 01:15:03,979
<i>Blast doors will be
sealed in six minutes.</i>

728
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:11,523
<i>This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

729
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:16,595
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion to your
nearest stairwell and descend to level 40.</i>

730
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:22,033
Madam President, three Capitol
squadrons just entered our airspace.

731
01:15:22,133 --> 01:15:26,034
- How much time do we have?
- They're a few seconds from range.

732
01:15:30,607 --> 01:15:33,044
- Prepare to scramble the fleet.
- Copy that.

733
01:15:33,144 --> 01:15:35,911
Open up short-range air defense.

734
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:43,654
Arm long-range missiles
for counterattack.

735
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:59,104
<i>This is a code red alert. Please,
remain calm and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

736
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:03,909
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion to your
nearest stairwell and descend to level 40.</i>

737
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:06,181
<i>Blast doors...</i>

738
01:16:10,681 --> 01:16:14,519
<i>This is a code red alert.
Please, remain calm...</i>

739
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:34,439
<i>This is a code red alert.
Proceed in an orderly fashion...</i>

740
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:37,773
Come on. Come on, hon.

741
01:16:46,617 --> 01:16:49,688
<i>Continue to the Supply Station
and claim one pack</i>

742
01:16:49,788 --> 01:16:52,157
<i>for each member of your compartment.</i>

743
01:16:52,657 --> 01:16:56,595
<i>Please keep all personal items
within your assigned area.</i>

744
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,862
<i>Be courteous to your fellow citizens.</i>

745
01:17:01,465 --> 01:17:03,602
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

746
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,038
<i>All citizens should be
inside the bunker.</i>

747
01:17:07,138 --> 01:17:10,371
- <i>Blast doors will close in two minutes.</i>
- Mom!

748
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,981
- Where's Prim?
- I thought she went to find you.

749
01:17:16,081 --> 01:17:19,148
- She must still be on the stairs.
- There's no one on the stairs.

750
01:17:21,985 --> 01:17:24,022
She went back for the cat.

751
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:28,493
<i>This is a code red alert.
All citizens should be inside the bunker.</i>

752
01:17:28,593 --> 01:17:29,732
Hey, stop! Stop!

753
01:17:29,832 --> 01:17:33,495
<i>Blast doors will close in one minute.</i>

754
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:42,340
They hit the far edge of the
northwest quadrant. Penetrated 40 feet.

755
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,010
Missed the living quarters.
Only minor damage to corridors 2 and 3.

756
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:47,771
- Is there any radiation?
- None detected.

757
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:50,216
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching.

758
01:17:51,016 --> 01:17:55,284
- <i>Blast doors will close in 30 seconds.</i>
- Prim!

759
01:17:57,854 --> 01:18:00,421
- Prim!
- Katniss!

760
01:18:06,063 --> 01:18:08,517
- <i>This is a code red alert.</i>
- Katniss!

761
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,236
- <i>Blast doors will close in 15 seconds.</i>
- Keep moving, keep moving!

762
01:18:11,336 --> 01:18:12,635
Get down here!

763
01:18:14,004 --> 01:18:16,106
- Hurry!
- <i>This is a code red alert.</i>

764
01:18:16,206 --> 01:18:20,142
- Come on!
- <i>Blast doors will close in 10 seconds.</i>

765
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:21,809
<i>Nine...</i>

766
01:18:22,512 --> 01:18:24,179
- <i>Eight...</i>
- Come on!

767
01:18:24,815 --> 01:18:26,427
<i>Seven...</i>

768
01:18:27,251 --> 01:18:28,817
<i>Six...</i>

769
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,157
<i>- Five...</i>
- Hold the doors!

770
01:18:32,257 --> 01:18:33,658
<i>Four...</i>

771
01:18:34,892 --> 01:18:36,556
<i>Three...</i>

772
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,928
- <i>Two...</i>
- Wait! Hold the doors!

773
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,078
<i>One.</i>

774
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,170
You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?

775
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,435
I wasn't gonna leave him behind.
I couldn't live with myself.

776
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:53,333
<i>- Blast doors are now sealed.</i>
- I know, Prim.

777
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,747
Let's go.

778
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:06,156
Damage to the aquifer in the northwest
quadrant. We lost a transport corridor.

779
01:19:06,256 --> 01:19:07,892
There's nothing else in the northwest.

780
01:19:07,992 --> 01:19:11,196
Our surface-to-air launchers
just took a direct hit in sector 3.

781
01:19:11,296 --> 01:19:15,214
Because we revealed ourselves.
They saw us firing there.

782
01:19:18,568 --> 01:19:20,405
Stand down. Don't launch the fleet.

783
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:25,209
Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching
sector 3 in attack formation.

784
01:19:25,309 --> 01:19:27,743
Hold fire on their approach.

785
01:19:31,449 --> 01:19:32,442
What'd they hit?

786
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:34,986
Bedrock. But there's debris
in the ventilation shaft.

787
01:19:35,086 --> 01:19:37,723
- They're not targeting our fleet.
- Or our Special Weaponry.

788
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:40,025
They don't know what we have
or where we have it.

789
01:19:40,325 --> 01:19:42,293
Can you confirm that everyone's
safely in the bunker?

790
01:19:42,393 --> 01:19:43,758
Already done.

791
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:46,997
Conceal all remaining
anti-aircraft guns.

792
01:19:47,097 --> 01:19:49,901
Seal launching pads
and ventilation corridors.

793
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:53,504
We are gonna wait this out.
This is what we're built for.

794
01:19:53,804 --> 01:19:55,740
They'll seal us in here like a tomb.

795
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,742
The Capitol's working off
some outdated information.

796
01:19:57,842 --> 01:20:01,578
- I'd rather not update it for them.
- Madam President, I know it's not my place...

797
01:20:01,678 --> 01:20:05,083
It's not. You're a welcome guest,
but you're out of your depth down here.

798
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:09,536
- Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it.
- Copy that.

799
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:13,621
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.
It's gonna be a long night.

800
01:20:52,362 --> 01:20:55,429
Prim, talk about something. Anything.

801
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:00,968
They promoted me at the hospital.

802
01:21:01,405 --> 01:21:05,586
I forgot to tell you.
They're training me to be a doctor.

803
01:21:06,842 --> 01:21:09,311
They'd be stupid not to.

804
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:24,931
Hey.

805
01:22:25,389 --> 01:22:28,123
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

806
01:22:32,329 --> 01:22:35,165
Snow's using Annie to punish you.

807
01:22:35,265 --> 01:22:37,699
He's taunting us with them.

808
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:43,472
I didn't understand until just now
watching that stupid cat.

809
01:22:51,515 --> 01:22:54,185
After your first Games,

810
01:22:54,285 --> 01:22:58,186
I thought the whole romance was an act.

811
01:22:59,723 --> 01:23:02,926
We all expected you
to continue that strategy.

812
01:23:03,026 --> 01:23:06,197
But it wasn't until
Peeta's heart stopped

813
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:09,225
and he nearly died that...

814
01:23:10,534 --> 01:23:12,932
I knew I'd misjudged you.

815
01:23:13,737 --> 01:23:15,697
You love him.

816
01:23:17,306 --> 01:23:20,311
I'm not saying in what way.
Maybe you don't even know yourself.

817
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:23,545
But anyone paying attention can see it.

818
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:26,499
How do you live with it?

819
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:32,857
I drag myself outta nightmares
and there's no relief in waking up.

820
01:23:32,957 --> 01:23:36,625
But... it's better not to give in to it.

821
01:23:38,996 --> 01:23:43,865
Takes 10 times longer to put yourself
back together than it does to fall apart.

822
01:23:53,577 --> 01:23:56,741
Katniss? Katniss?

823
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,314
Come with me.

824
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,255
We took their best shot. Didn't we?

825
01:24:08,358 --> 01:24:09,994
Yeah.

826
01:24:10,094 --> 01:24:13,330
- Your mother and sister okay?
- Yeah, they're fine.

827
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,766
I need you to do something for us.

828
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:20,070
I need you to tell Panem that we
survived an attack by the Capitol

829
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:25,006
with no casualties.
And we remain fully operational.

830
01:24:25,608 --> 01:24:27,174
Okay.

831
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,480
You should know something.

832
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:34,750
We had eight extra minutes of civilian
evacuation because of Peeta's warning.

833
01:24:35,284 --> 01:24:37,019
I won't forget that.

834
01:24:38,187 --> 01:24:39,922
Thank you.

835
01:24:54,738 --> 01:25:00,108
So Katniss, it's "13 is alive
and well and so am I."

836
01:25:01,344 --> 01:25:02,945
Katniss?

837
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:06,380
Katniss.

838
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:10,085
Never one to waste it
in rehearsal, I know.

839
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:17,445
Why would they drop these?

840
01:26:20,357 --> 01:26:21,859
For me.

841
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:24,152
Ready to go, Katniss?

842
01:26:25,128 --> 01:26:27,395
We're gonna do this,
just like District 8.

843
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:32,733
Tell me about the roses.

844
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:42,610
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.

845
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:47,818
He's gonna kill Peeta.

846
01:26:47,918 --> 01:26:50,588
Let's try again. Can you speak up?
We don't have a mic on you.

847
01:26:50,688 --> 01:26:54,790
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

848
01:26:57,827 --> 01:27:00,328
He's gonna kill Peeta.

849
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:05,467
- I can't.
- Katniss?

850
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:09,240
- You can do it, Katniss.
- I can't do this.

851
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:12,543
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

852
01:27:12,643 --> 01:27:15,646
He's just gonna keep...
He's never gonna stop.

853
01:27:15,746 --> 01:27:18,449
- Cressida, we should cut the cameras.
- It's okay, Katniss.

854
01:27:18,549 --> 01:27:22,450
No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

855
01:27:23,153 --> 01:27:25,990
He's doing this because
I'm The Mockingjay.

856
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,558
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.

857
01:27:28,658 --> 01:27:30,552
No.

858
01:27:31,428 --> 01:27:33,731
- No, I can't do this.
- Katniss.

859
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:37,501
- Don't make me do this!
- Let her go.

860
01:27:37,601 --> 01:27:41,135
I got... I gotta get out of here.

861
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:02,860
So this is the end?

862
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,261
I s'pose you're just gonna
hide down here forever?

863
01:28:06,796 --> 01:28:08,870
I can't be The Mockingjay.

864
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:12,601
Not The Mockingjay. Just Katniss.

865
01:28:15,038 --> 01:28:20,008
You know, you're the only
real friend I have down here.

866
01:28:24,147 --> 01:28:28,652
I don't suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?

867
01:28:28,752 --> 01:28:32,889
- You're unbelievable.
- Okay, but I meant what I said.

868
01:28:33,191 --> 01:28:37,005
Look, the reason I'm here
is to let you know

869
01:28:37,226 --> 01:28:38,760
they're rescuing Peeta.

870
01:28:40,596 --> 01:28:43,100
- What?
- The dam went down in District 5,

871
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,271
took out most of the power to the Capitol.
Knocked out their signal defense.

872
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:51,741
Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

873
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:54,445
A window is open to us.
How much longer? I don't know.

874
01:28:54,545 --> 01:28:57,281
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

875
01:28:57,381 --> 01:28:58,582
And President Coin?

876
01:28:58,682 --> 01:29:03,640
You know, I can never fully support
that woman in light of the...

877
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:08,161
prohibition they have
going on around this place, but...

878
01:29:08,261 --> 01:29:12,363
Plutarch got word that Peeta and
the others are in the Tribute Center.

879
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:15,799
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

880
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:19,970
She knows that Peeta is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you're ours.

881
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:23,841
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

882
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:26,145
she's going to get him.

883
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:29,813
- I have to go help.
- Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait.

884
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:33,150
Come on. What, are you just gonna jump
out of the vent and go storm the Capitol?

885
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,587
Besides, it's already underway.

886
01:29:36,187 --> 01:29:39,423
Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only.

887
01:29:39,523 --> 01:29:43,091
And guess who was
the first brave soul to sign up.

888
01:29:43,893 --> 01:29:45,645
Gale.

889
01:29:54,671 --> 01:29:56,774
- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

890
01:29:56,874 --> 01:29:59,116
Go in the center there.

891
01:29:59,574 --> 01:30:01,577
Those rocks.

892
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:06,052
Castor, to the left.

893
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,107
Pollux, you're with me.
So we'll go straight to camera.

894
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:13,257
Okay? Finnick?

895
01:30:13,357 --> 01:30:14,625
Yeah.

896
01:30:14,925 --> 01:30:18,095
Okay. Take your time.

897
01:30:18,195 --> 01:30:21,496
Just remember to keep talking
and don't stop.

898
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,878
This is Finnick Odair.

899
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,708
<i>Winner of the 65th Hunger Games.</i>

900
01:30:30,808 --> 01:30:34,411
<i>And I'm coming to you
from District 13, alive and well.</i>

901
01:30:34,511 --> 01:30:37,648
<i>We've survived an assault
from the Capitol.</i>

902
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:40,484
<i>But I'm not here
to give you recent news.</i>

903
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:44,455
- Why is Finnick doing a propo?
- It's a lot more than that.

904
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:48,225
- Beetee's commandeered the system.
- Now that they're down to generator power

905
01:30:48,325 --> 01:30:50,494
there's a more limited range of
frequencies available to them.

906
01:30:50,594 --> 01:30:52,429
And I'm filling them
all up with Finnick.

907
01:30:52,529 --> 01:30:55,400
Not many will see it, but whoever does
will think it's another propo.

908
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,986
What they don't know is this broadcast
is jamming their entire system with noise.

909
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:02,172
Early defense warning,
internal communications, everything.

910
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,641
As long as the broadcast goes through,

911
01:31:03,741 --> 01:31:06,410
our team should be able
to get in and out undetected.

912
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,380
<i>The truth.
Not the myths about a life of luxury.</i>

913
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,750
<i>Not the lie about glory
for your homeland.</i>

914
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:15,186
<i>You can survive the arena.</i>

915
01:31:15,286 --> 01:31:18,319
<i>The moment you leave, you're a slave.</i>

916
01:31:31,134 --> 01:31:35,272
<i>Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One, you are
one minute out from perimeter defense.</i>

917
01:31:35,614 --> 01:31:39,310
- Going dark.
- <i>Stay low in case they're online.</i>

918
01:31:40,109 --> 01:31:42,513
<i>President Snow used to sell me.</i>

919
01:31:42,613 --> 01:31:45,883
<i>Or my body, at least.
I wasn't the only one.</i>

920
01:31:45,983 --> 01:31:49,838
<i>If a Victor is considered desirable,
the President gives them as a reward</i>

921
01:31:49,938 --> 01:31:54,725
<i>or allows people to buy them.
If you refuse, he kills someone you love.</i>

922
01:31:54,825 --> 01:31:58,626
Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds
from perimeter defense.

923
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:05,199
Ten seconds.

924
01:32:05,299 --> 01:32:07,204
Nine... Eight...

925
01:32:07,404 --> 01:32:10,273
<i>Seven... Six... Five...</i>

926
01:32:10,873 --> 01:32:13,908
<i>Four... Three... Two...</i>

927
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:15,621
<i>One.</i>

928
01:32:24,053 --> 01:32:27,357
<i>No response from perimeter defense.
We're inside Capitol airspace.</i>

929
01:32:27,457 --> 01:32:31,483
<i>To make themselves feel better, my patrons
would make presents of money or jewelry.</i>

930
01:32:31,962 --> 01:32:36,734
<i>But I found a much more
valuable form of payment.</i>

931
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:37,935
<i>Secrets.</i>

932
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:39,657
Gear up.

933
01:33:00,023 --> 01:33:01,789
Switching to Night View.

934
01:33:09,866 --> 01:33:11,510
There.

935
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,974
Command, we have visual
on the Tribute Center.

936
01:33:17,074 --> 01:33:19,407
<i>Initiating final approach.</i>

937
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:25,013
Masks on.

938
01:33:30,086 --> 01:33:33,591
<i>See, I know all the depravity,
the deceit and the cruelty</i>

939
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:36,561
<i>of the Capitol's pampered elite.</i>

940
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:41,463
<i>But the biggest secrets are about
our good President, Coriolanus Snow.</i>

941
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:50,457
Open the door.

942
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:01,384
<i>Command, this is Team Leader.</i>

943
01:34:01,484 --> 01:34:05,219
Prepare to deploy gas.
We will confirm once inside.

944
01:34:08,525 --> 01:34:12,062
<i>Such a young man when he rose to power.
Such a clever one to keep it.</i>

945
01:34:12,162 --> 01:34:15,663
<i>How, you may ask, did he do it?</i>

946
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:18,833
<i>One word.</i>

947
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:20,968
<i>Poison.</i>

948
01:34:27,143 --> 01:34:29,091
Get ready to drop.

949
01:34:56,072 --> 01:35:00,137
<i>He stopped every mutiny
before it even started.</i>

950
01:35:09,886 --> 01:35:11,398
Clear.

951
01:35:14,657 --> 01:35:19,096
Clear. Command, we're inside.
Heading toward target number one.

952
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:22,163
Cell P45 lower level 2C.

953
01:35:22,865 --> 01:35:24,038
Gas.

954
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:28,502
<i>There are so many mysterious deaths
to adversaries.</i>

955
01:35:29,305 --> 01:35:31,439
<i>Even to allies who were threats.</i>

956
01:35:42,885 --> 01:35:45,756
<i>Snow would drink from the same cup,
to deflect suspicion.</i>

957
01:35:45,856 --> 01:35:48,959
<i>But antidotes don't always work,</i>

958
01:35:49,059 --> 01:35:52,062
<i>which is why he wears roses
that reek of perfume.</i>

959
01:35:52,162 --> 01:35:56,931
<i>Help cover the scent of blood from sores
in his mouth that will never heal.</i>

960
01:36:21,557 --> 01:36:23,124
Gale.

961
01:36:26,863 --> 01:36:31,402
<i>But he can't hide the scent of who
he really is. He kills without mercy.</i>

962
01:36:31,502 --> 01:36:34,334
<i>He rules with deception and fear.</i>

963
01:36:59,628 --> 01:37:03,266
<i>His weapon of choice
is the only thing suited to such a man.</i>

964
01:37:03,366 --> 01:37:07,601
<i>Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.</i>

965
01:37:09,138 --> 01:37:10,686
<i>What is this place?</i>

966
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:22,986
- Beetee?
- I'm losing them.

967
01:37:23,086 --> 01:37:24,618
Powering back up.

968
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:30,260
Ma'am, the Capitol air defense system
is rebooting. It's coming back online.

969
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,127
Must be diverting power
from another source.

970
01:37:32,227 --> 01:37:34,832
And filtering transmissions.
Another 60 seconds and we'll be cut off.

971
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:37,197
Madam President, should we
call back the hovercraft?

972
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,604
Broadcast me.

973
01:37:40,804 --> 01:37:44,508
If Snow's watching this, maybe he'll
let the signal in, if he sees me.

974
01:37:45,008 --> 01:37:46,810
Put me on the air so he can see me.

975
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:49,413
- Yes. Yes.
- Put her on.

976
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:51,949
Can we do this? Can we still get in?

977
01:37:52,049 --> 01:37:54,518
Yes. For the moment. The line's open.
He will only see you.

978
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:56,453
Okay, Katniss, go.

979
01:37:56,553 --> 01:37:59,423
President Snow?
President Snow. It's Katniss.

980
01:37:59,523 --> 01:38:02,492
- There's no guarantee he's even watching.
- President Snow?

981
01:38:02,592 --> 01:38:06,195
- I know, but he might be.
- President Snow, I need to speak with you.

982
01:38:06,295 --> 01:38:08,063
Are you there?

983
01:38:08,665 --> 01:38:12,699
President Snow, it's Katniss.
Can you hear me?

984
01:38:13,768 --> 01:38:15,636
I need to speak with you.

985
01:38:17,473 --> 01:38:22,301
President Snow, it's Katniss.
President Snow, are you there?

986
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,882
Can you hear me?

987
01:38:33,172 --> 01:38:37,524
- President Snow...
<i>- Miss Everdeen. What an honor.</i>

988
01:38:38,527 --> 01:38:43,464
<i>I don't imagine you're calling
to thank me for the roses.</i>

989
01:38:44,767 --> 01:38:47,066
I never asked for this.

990
01:38:47,703 --> 01:38:49,605
I never asked to be in the Games.

991
01:38:49,905 --> 01:38:53,606
- Boggs? Come in. Boggs?
- I never asked to be The Mockingjay.

992
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:58,182
Just wanted to save my sister.
And keep Peeta alive.

993
01:38:58,482 --> 01:39:01,044
Come in. Boggs?

994
01:39:01,685 --> 01:39:05,322
Please, just let him go.
And I will stop being The Mockingjay.

995
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:07,724
I will disappear. You will never
have to see me ever again.

996
01:39:07,824 --> 01:39:08,982
<i>Miss Everdeen.</i>

997
01:39:09,659 --> 01:39:13,010
- Boggs, come in.
- <i>You couldn't run from this...</i>

998
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:16,600
<i>any more than you could have
run from the Games.</i>

999
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:21,403
- Command, I need a situation report.
- <i>Boggs, we're running out of time. Hurry.</i>

1000
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:24,273
Let's move.

1001
01:39:24,373 --> 01:39:25,575
Please.

1002
01:39:25,975 --> 01:39:27,982
You've won.

1003
01:39:30,679 --> 01:39:32,828
You've already beaten me.

1004
01:39:35,518 --> 01:39:38,519
Release Peeta. And take me instead.

1005
01:39:40,456 --> 01:39:43,493
<i>We're long past the opportunity</i>

1006
01:39:43,593 --> 01:39:45,762
<i>for noble sacrifice.</i>

1007
01:39:45,862 --> 01:39:49,733
Then tell me what to do.
I've always kept my promises, haven't I?

1008
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:55,536
<i>You said you didn't want a war.
And that's just what's happened.</i>

1009
01:39:56,238 --> 01:39:59,376
<i>I told you what a fragile
thing peace was.</i>

1010
01:39:59,476 --> 01:40:01,378
<i>And still, like a child,</i>

1011
01:40:01,678 --> 01:40:04,777
<i>you took pleasure in breaking it.</i>

1012
01:40:05,648 --> 01:40:07,383
<i>I know what you are.</i>

1013
01:40:07,683 --> 01:40:11,254
<i>I know you can't see past
your narrowest concerns.</i>

1014
01:40:11,354 --> 01:40:14,288
<i>But please, Miss Everdeen.</i>

1015
01:40:14,523 --> 01:40:17,194
<i>I doubt you know
what honesty is anymore.</i>

1016
01:40:17,294 --> 01:40:20,330
Command, we're at the first target.
Preparing to extract Peeta.

1017
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:22,029
Will confirm when he's in hand.

1018
01:40:24,902 --> 01:40:27,104
Mockingjay One,
prepare hovercraft for evac.

1019
01:40:27,304 --> 01:40:30,373
You asked me to convince you
that I was in love with Peeta.

1020
01:40:30,473 --> 01:40:33,006
Haven't I at least done that?

1021
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:35,176
<i>Miss Everdeen,</i>

1022
01:40:36,745 --> 01:40:40,347
<i>it's the things we love most</i>

1023
01:40:40,549 --> 01:40:42,683
<i>that destroy us.</i>

1024
01:40:44,253 --> 01:40:46,045
<i>I want you to remember</i>

1025
01:40:47,267 --> 01:40:49,528
<i>that I said that.</i>

1026
01:40:53,928 --> 01:40:58,158
<i>Don't you think I know your friends
are in the Tribute Center?</i>

1027
01:40:59,735 --> 01:41:00,868
<i>Cut them off.</i>

1028
01:41:02,984 --> 01:41:04,967
- <i>Boggs, come in.</i>
- What happened?

1029
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:07,477
Boggs, come in. Do you read me?

1030
01:41:07,577 --> 01:41:10,447
- He knows that they're in there. It's a trap.
- Katniss, hold it.

1031
01:41:10,547 --> 01:41:13,217
We have to get a hold of them.
We have to tell them to get out. He knows.

1032
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,485
There's no signal.
We can't contact them.

1033
01:41:15,585 --> 01:41:19,389
No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.

1034
01:41:19,489 --> 01:41:22,192
- No, Haymitch. They're in there.
- No, we don't know that.

1035
01:41:22,292 --> 01:41:25,662
Did I lose them both tonight?
Did I lose them both tonight?

1036
01:41:25,762 --> 01:41:28,031
Did I lose them both tonight?

1037
01:41:28,131 --> 01:41:31,501
Did I lose them? I lost them both.

1038
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:33,700
No! No!

1039
01:41:42,344 --> 01:41:43,778
There's no news.

1040
01:41:45,948 --> 01:41:47,647
I'm sorry.

1041
01:41:50,186 --> 01:41:53,087
It's the worst torture in the world.

1042
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:58,225
Waiting, when you know
there's nothing you can do.

1043
01:42:03,266 --> 01:42:05,900
Especially for people like us.

1044
01:42:06,669 --> 01:42:08,828
But whatever

1045
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:11,688
strength, courage,

1046
01:42:11,874 --> 01:42:13,908
madness,

1047
01:42:14,376 --> 01:42:18,345
keeps us going, you find it,
at times like these.

1048
01:42:20,949 --> 01:42:23,187
You have it, soldier.

1049
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,620
It's what's kept you
alive all this time.

1050
01:42:27,489 --> 01:42:29,824
And it won't fail you now.

1051
01:42:51,647 --> 01:42:53,077
They're back.

1052
01:43:01,557 --> 01:43:03,293
I don't want that.

1053
01:43:07,796 --> 01:43:08,998
Johanna.

1054
01:43:09,298 --> 01:43:10,697
Finnick!

1055
01:43:11,867 --> 01:43:13,203
Finnick!

1056
01:43:13,503 --> 01:43:16,836
Annie? Annie! Annie!

1057
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:22,742
You're safe. You're safe.

1058
01:43:29,485 --> 01:43:31,152
Gale!

1059
01:43:33,922 --> 01:43:35,689
Are you okay?

1060
01:43:36,825 --> 01:43:38,195
What? What is it?

1061
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:44,098
I don't get it. Every gun was back online
and on us and we flew right past them.

1062
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,266
They let us go.

1063
01:43:51,072 --> 01:43:52,406
He's in there.

1064
01:43:54,543 --> 01:43:58,679
The gas we used on the guards knocked
him out, too, but it's wearing off now.

1065
01:44:00,248 --> 01:44:02,416
You should be there when he wakes up.

1066
01:44:07,355 --> 01:44:09,222
Thank you.

1067
01:44:11,827 --> 01:44:13,560
Thank you.

1068
01:44:33,382 --> 01:44:35,033
Peeta.

1069
01:45:08,783 --> 01:45:10,153
Peeta!

1070
01:45:10,553 --> 01:45:14,190
Peeta! Get off! Get off of her!

1071
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:15,921
Let go!

1072
01:45:50,493 --> 01:45:52,762
No, Katniss.
No, you're swollen. Don't touch.

1073
01:45:52,862 --> 01:45:56,330
No, no, no. Calm down.
Calm down. You're okay.

1074
01:45:59,168 --> 01:46:00,934
Tell her she's awake.

1075
01:46:02,838 --> 01:46:04,574
- Pee...
- Don't try to talk.

1076
01:46:04,674 --> 01:46:07,226
Peeta's okay. I promise.

1077
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:09,700
I just had to get him off you.

1078
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:18,574
It's called hijacking.

1079
01:46:19,389 --> 01:46:22,417
We don't know how long the Capitol's
been doing this to Peeta.

1080
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:27,130
It's fear conditioning.
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.

1081
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:30,267
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

1082
01:46:30,667 --> 01:46:33,940
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

1083
01:46:34,703 --> 01:46:36,849
And they torture him.

1084
01:46:37,365 --> 01:46:41,678
With shocks and beatings,
and strip down his identity.

1085
01:46:41,778 --> 01:46:44,714
And then all of that suffering
and fear is redirected.

1086
01:46:44,814 --> 01:46:48,867
Associated with other memories
or a person.

1087
01:46:49,752 --> 01:46:51,921
They can change his memories of Katniss?

1088
01:46:52,021 --> 01:46:54,375
To make her seem life-threatening.

1089
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:59,660
They turned him into a weapon, Katniss.
To kill you.

1090
01:47:00,962 --> 01:47:02,052
But you can reverse it?

1091
01:47:02,152 --> 01:47:03,933
The fear is the most difficult
thing to overcome.

1092
01:47:04,033 --> 01:47:06,869
We're hardwired to remember fear best.

1093
01:47:06,969 --> 01:47:08,970
It's new terrain.

1094
01:47:09,738 --> 01:47:12,572
But we've put together a team.

1095
01:47:12,874 --> 01:47:15,108
I'm optimistic.

1096
01:47:41,403 --> 01:47:43,266
Good evening.

1097
01:47:43,972 --> 01:47:49,045
Yesterday, I authorized a covert
rescue mission inside the Capitol.

1098
01:47:49,445 --> 01:47:52,115
I am pleased to announce

1099
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:56,223
that the Victors have been liberated!

1100
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:05,939
Let this day mark an historic change.

1101
01:48:06,596 --> 01:48:09,999
With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,

1102
01:48:10,099 --> 01:48:13,703
we have sent a clear message
to the Capitol.

1103
01:48:13,803 --> 01:48:18,205
That we will never again
endure injustice.

1104
01:48:23,278 --> 01:48:27,751
Today, a day on which
we reunited family,

1105
01:48:28,351 --> 01:48:31,488
friends, and loved ones.

1106
01:48:31,688 --> 01:48:36,293
Let all of Panem come together.

1107
01:48:36,693 --> 01:48:40,563
Not to battle for the amusement
of the Capitol.

1108
01:48:40,663 --> 01:48:43,698
But to join hands in this fight.

1109
01:48:50,539 --> 01:48:53,309
Let today be the day we promise

1110
01:48:53,409 --> 01:48:55,033
never to give up,

1111
01:48:55,533 --> 01:48:59,983
never to give in
until we have made a new Panem,

1112
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:04,387
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

1113
01:49:04,487 --> 01:49:08,858
And where the districts are free
to share the fruits of their labors

1114
01:49:08,958 --> 01:49:11,525
and not fight one another for scraps!

1115
01:49:24,673 --> 01:49:29,989
This new Panem is on the horizon.
But we must take it for ourselves.

1116
01:49:30,246 --> 01:49:34,517
The road there leads through
the sharp mountains

1117
01:49:34,617 --> 01:49:37,720
and deep ravines of District 2.

1118
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:42,018
There in the heart of Panem's
steepest mountain range

1119
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:45,893
lies the Capitol's principal
military facility.

1120
01:49:46,928 --> 01:49:49,699
We can conquer this stronghold

1121
01:49:49,799 --> 01:49:53,002
because we are one people,

1122
01:49:53,102 --> 01:49:56,739
one army, one voice.

1123
01:49:56,839 --> 01:50:01,444
Because today is our new beginning.

1124
01:50:01,544 --> 01:50:05,881
Today we have freed the Victors.

1125
01:50:05,981 --> 01:50:09,216
Tomorrow, Panem!

1126
01:50:17,292 --> 01:50:21,495
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!
