1
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,953
Oh, shit.
Darcy, you really shouldn't have come.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,334
Show me.

3
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,663
Corporate
was adamant. We keep running.

4
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,342
No stopping operations.

5
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,507
No, no, no. You got to go through.
No cameras.

6
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,925
He's got orders to kill.

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,510
I don't even think
international laws apply up here.

8
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,641
We are geologists first.

9
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,519
If this thing
has any historical significance at all,

10
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,067
we are shutting down.
I'm shutting us down.

11
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,397
Oh, he's going to shoot me? Shoot me.

12
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,049
Hey, don't kill her.

13
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,442
This is crazy stuff.

14
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,995
Crazy shit.

15
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,924
Well, what do you think?

16
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,006
I think history is about to change.

17
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,925
I'm a <i>nasty</i> woman

18
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,632
Oh, look who decided
to show up for work.

19
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,009
<i>I'm a heartbreaker</i>

20
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,686
<i>Gonna make you cry</i>

21
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,021
What, surf report no good
at South Padre?

22
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,692
The waves are flat and I got no gas.
You know that, Cade.

23
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,858
Dude. Rude.

24
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,324
Look at these two junebugs.
Whoo! My, my!

25
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,497
Hey, you're paying me on this one,
right, Cade?

26
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,852
Please tell me I'm getting paid.

27
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,209
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys
are just happy to have a job at all.

28
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,535
Yeah, I suppose.

29
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,064
- You got any cash on you?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,079
All right, good.

31
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,676
Hey, Lucas Flannery.

32
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,680
Place has been
in the family since '28.

33
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,729
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

34
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,691
Real soon
he's going to sign it over to me.

35
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,394
The movies nowadays,
that's the trouble.

36
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,155
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.

37
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,357
I love that one. Oh.

38
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,234
He's deaf and senile.

39
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,489
Heard that.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,821
Now these just need
some spit and polish.

41
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,748
I believe they're digital, possibly IMAX.

42
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,991
Yeah, they're not.

43
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,328
Mister, we'll have a look around
if you want to leave us to it, okay?

44
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,253
You know, folks used to come
from miles around

45
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,591
to see the dancing girls
with the big cha-chas.

46
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,834
I swear to God

47
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,077
I am one diaper change away
from poisoning his oatmeal.

48
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,463
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

49
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,713
If coming here makes you feel young,

50
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,265
then you tell this kid
to bring you here every day.

51
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,263
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

52
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,389
Sold.

53
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,848
Remember this place
when we were kids?

54
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,605
How many girls you think
you brought here in high school?

55
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,523
I only remember one.

56
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,654
Hey, heads!

57
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,155
Ow!

58
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,783
That's why you didn't make
the varsity team.

59
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,497
Ah.

60
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,421
All right. Go long.

61
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,303
Leave it.

62
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,994
Mortar shells?

63
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,821
What the hell happened to you?

64
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,750
Hey, snakeballs.
How much for the truck?

65
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,332
Truck?

66
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,020
Two more weeks, girls,
till no more classes, ever.

67
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,849
Almost time to get a tan and get wasted!

68
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,717
Please, please.

69
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,428
No financial aid. Great.

70
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,436
Yes, I know I'm home, thank you.

71
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,193
<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises!</i>

72
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,945
- Voice recognition. It's me!
<i>- I</i> am <i>dialing</i> 911.

73
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,944
Go right ahead. I don't care.

74
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,029
<i>I'm still calling 911.</i>

75
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,868
The Battle of Chicago was an <i>event</i>

76
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,666
<i>that permanently changed our world.</i>

77
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,741
Over <i>1,300 dead.</i>

78
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,224
<i>Much of the city has been destroyed.</i>

79
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,287
<i>Homeland Security is urging everyone</i>

80
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,089
<i>to report suspicious alien activity.</i>

81
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,210
<i>A swift act</i> of Congress

82
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,341
<i>put an end to all joint operations</i>

83
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,346
between the military and the Autobots,
ending the alliance.

84
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,706
<i>As this committee knows,
the Invasion of Chicago</i>

85
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,142
<i>was a defining day
for our nation five years ago.</i>

86
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,145
The day millions of people realized that

87
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,478
never again can we allow aliens
to fight our battles for us.

88
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,691
A handful of Autobots
were given sanctuary

89
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,743
after joint-combat operations
were abolished.

90
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,287
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons
are still on the run

91
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,326
thanks to our CIA unit,

92
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,620
"Cemetery Wind."

93
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,289
<i>Hurry, let's get it
to my house, guys.</i>

94
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,540
As for the alien technology,

95
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,699
our objective remains
to keep it in American control.

96
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,348
<i>Hi. My name is Timothy.
This is my crew.</i>

97
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,001
<i>We found this alien ball turret
in Chicago.</i>

98
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,345
<i>We just found it in the rubble
and it's all working...</i>

99
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,134
Word has it Japan, India,

100
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,551
the Israelis may have gotten their hands
on a couple of ships.

101
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,633
Apparently the Russians
are starting a bidding war.

102
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,477
<i>We're taking $5,000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.</i>

103
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,942
A new era has begun.

104
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,484
And the age of the Transformers is over.

105
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,043
Hey.

106
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,630
<i>Hey, I've been waiting for you.</i>

107
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,719
<i>You're looking hot today!</i>

108
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,519
Oh, yeah?
How about you take your shirt off?

109
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,390
<i>You want me to take my shirt off
right now?</i>

110
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,642
<i>What would your dad think of that?</i>

111
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,064
- What the hell?
- Hey, where you going?

112
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,141
I cannot believe him.
I cannot believe this.

113
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,062
What the hell?

114
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,856
All the way!

115
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,527
A truck?

116
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,490
Dad, please tell me
you didn't spend our money on this.

117
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,165
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't.
He spent my money.

118
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,521
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

119
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,202
As an advance
on your regular paycheck.

120
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,625
- What regular paycheck?
- Which you will get back.

121
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,172
- When?
- Never. We're broke.

122
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,415
I knew it.

123
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,376
Sweetheart, could you please not
drive a wedge

124
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,659
between employer and employee.

125
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,421
Hold on. I thought we were partners.

126
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,631
Look, I came up short, okay?
I had to buy her a prom dress.

127
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,194
You want me to deny her a prom dress?

128
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,726
You might as well.
You denied her a prom date.

129
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,724
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.

130
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,598
Nobody wants to go to the dance
with their dad. It's weird.

131
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,890
It's not the issue.

132
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,518
Well, maybe it should be.

133
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,817
Hey. Could you guys
Just get Off my case?

134
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,700
You know what the engine
on this runs for?

135
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,105
I can break it down and strip it for parts.

136
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,158
And sweetheart, your shorts
are shrinking by the second, okay?

137
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,743
Cold water, air dry, please.

138
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,363
I think she looks hot.

139
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,823
What did you say?

140
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,537
Like a hot teenager.

141
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,252
Oh, it's the "teenager" thing
that makes it better. Thank you.

142
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,727
It didn't sound like what it meant.

143
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,697
That goes by the circuit boards.

144
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,138
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

145
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,717
Dad, please. You can't keep
spending money on junk

146
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,598
just so you can turn it
into different junk.

147
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,429
We do not use the "J" word in here.

148
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,185
That is a Super Simplex
theater projector. It's very rare.

149
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,188
What about the SmilePilot?

150
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,104
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented?
Simply ahead of their time.

151
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,731
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.

152
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,396
You're gonna get him upset.

153
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,282
Hey, Cade! Cade!

154
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,946
This thing still work?

155
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,281
- No!
- Yes.

156
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,564
Yes, and still groundbreaking.

157
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,620
Go back there and lay on the recliner
and just wait for a cold one.

158
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,507
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

159
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,803
Final notice, late notice, past due.

160
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,301
Come on, come on.

161
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,138
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on.

162
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,886
I mean, what is all this crap
people send you?

163
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,856
That's a Discman
and that's an 8-track tape.

164
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,733
- Music.
- Never heard of it.

165
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,562
Look, I fix that,
it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250.

166
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,068
If I would have been able to fix that
before you broke it even more,

167
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,148
it would have been 20 bucks.

168
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,484
This stuff is what's
gonna put you through college,

169
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,656
as long as you land
one of those scholarships.

170
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,488
What's the estimated time of arrival,
usually? Average?

171
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,660
Wait. So it just brings
the beer near you?

172
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,869
That's the trick?

173
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,293
- It's got a couple kinks, man.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,125
Dad, you think maybe some things
should never be invented?

175
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,676
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking.

176
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,512
This is a temple of technology.
You guys are standing in a holy place.

177
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,262
What do you think?
Why don't you look at all of this?

178
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,309
This could be yours.
What about this land?

179
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,263
Purple People Eater's back
and she looks hungry.

180
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,015
Isn't this incredible?

181
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,785
- I knew you would like it.
- Hey, you!

182
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,063
Hey.

183
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,524
I own this house! It's not for sale!

184
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,947
Six months late on payments,
Mr. Yeager.

185
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,191
And I see you stealing power
at the pole.

186
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,675
Hey, that's not your concern.

187
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,661
- Sir, do you wanna see the property?
- Sure.

188
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,409
I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour.

189
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll show you three other buyers
I got buried out back,

190
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,541
then I'll crack your head open
like an egg!

191
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,096
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Stay back! He's crazy.

192
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,370
I told you don't come back here
anymore.

193
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,874
I will have my brother come back
and beat your <i>ass!</i>

194
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,501
- Don't you start with me.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

195
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,877
And I'll bring the police
when I come, too!

196
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,176
- My brother ain't no joke!
- Who, Jerry?

197
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,618
You bring his big ass up here,

198
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,130
he's gonna be huffing and puffing
before he can squeeze out of that car!

199
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,620
You back out on my grass,
you're gonna be in big trouble!

200
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,144
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I'll give him some pecan pie.

201
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,646
Hey!

202
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,981
She smashed through the fence?

203
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,064
Cade, relax.
You're going to have an aortic infarction.

204
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,194
What is that?

205
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,900
I think it's a brain heart attack.

206
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,280
Yeah, I've had one already.

207
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,694
So we're stealing power now?

208
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,324
No, we're borrowing it
from the neighbors.

209
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,498
Great. That's awesome.

210
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,409
Once I graduate and I'm gone,
who's gonna take care of you?

211
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,744
Oh, you take care of me?

212
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,971
Who taught you how to solder a circuit?

213
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,421
Or write a program?
Or French braid your hair?

214
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,334
Or throw a spiral? Me. That's what I do.

215
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,177
Who taught you how to cook
without ketchup,

216
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,879
or balance your checkbook?

217
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,676
Who always has to be the grownup
around here?

218
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,105
All right, you got a point, okay?
But that means we're a great team.

219
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,728
And I know it's been sucky
around here lately.

220
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,777
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie.
You just gotta keep believing, okay?

221
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,195
I mean, that's what great inventors do.

222
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,241
I promise you, one day,
I'm gonna build something that matters.

223
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,695
I believe you, Dad.

224
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,661
You know, your mom
would be very proud of you.

225
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,126
It's going to be okay.

226
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,280
Spread out! Push right!

227
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,532
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

228
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,121
Give me two. Give me two.

229
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,161
Take the beach, nice and easy.

230
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,911
<i>All right, hold what you got.</i>

231
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,622
Release the mini-drones.

232
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,107
<i>Vipers.
Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.</i>

233
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,696
Got a heat sig. Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

234
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,157
<i>Predator 0-1.
Captured target area.</i>

235
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,901
Set charges.

236
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,709
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.

237
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,706
Frogman 83, Frogman 83.

238
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,071
Breached site on rooftop.

239
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,569
- Breached site on rooftop.
- Have Echo Platoon on standby.

240
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,235
Let the helo know
we're moving external!

241
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,907
<i>Alpha, take port.
Bravo, take starboard.</i>

242
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,967
<i>Shift right. Shift right.</i>

243
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,166
Cracking steel!

244
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,468
No!

245
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,640
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

246
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,849
Fire.

247
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,307
<i>Missiles out. Danger close.</i>

248
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,819
He's running! Move!

249
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,109
<i>He's on the run!
He's on the run!</i>

250
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,791
No! Please!

251
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,790
Hold your fire.

252
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,219
Hold! Hold fire!

253
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,506
Can you not see'? I've been injured.

254
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,933
Box him in. Box him in.

255
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,558
Medical Officer Ratchet! I'm a friend!

256
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,567
I'm an Autobot!

257
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,439
Then why are you running?

258
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,405
<i>Optimus sent this distress message.</i>

259
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,323
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

260
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,245
<i>We are under targeted attack.
Cease all contact with humans.</i>

261
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,912
We're all hiding.
All Autobots are being hunted.

262
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,163
We're all in danger.

263
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,498
I lost a sister in Chicago.

264
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,671
You'll get no sympathy from me.

265
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,521
What's wrong with you humans?

266
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
No! Please.

267
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,533
Check fire, check fire!

268
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,458
He's mine now.

269
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,803
Lockdown.

270
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,631
Autobots, Decepticons.

271
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,140
Like little children, always fighting.

272
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,063
Making a mess out of the universe.

273
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,728
Then I've got to clean it up.

274
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,272
There is one way you survive.

275
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,195
Tell me where he's hiding.

276
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,570
Where is Optimus Prime?

277
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,368
Never.

278
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,500
Never is here.

279
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,681
I must say, it is remarkable,

280
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,259
really astounding,
the success that the CIA has had

281
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,185
since you have taken
operational control,

282
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,264
and so the President
has asked me to ask you

283
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,190
to ask him,

284
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,143
to invite you both

285
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,402
over to the White House
just to powwow,

286
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,446
where we get maybe
some more specifics about how

287
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,995
exactly you're hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

288
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,372
I've had my desk for two years.

289
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,791
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

290
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,416
He runs the projects
where I don't ask for specifics.

291
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,213
That's why they're called Black Ops.

292
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,795
And why we all sleep better at night.

293
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,135
Check. That is great. So, um...

294
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,262
Any dirt on that?
Uh, how, uh, that's going?

295
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,594
Outstanding.

296
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,012
Great. Oh, great.

297
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,894
I was hoping to hear that.
The President will be pleased.

298
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:28,399
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only
been Chief of Staff since Monday, um,

299
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,856
but I do know that
the alien war stuff, these are...

300
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,691
These are the only fun meetings.

301
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,475
Look, I'm not here
to entertain the President,

302
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,031
but you may tell him
that the war will be over.

303
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,782
Soon.

304
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,832
"...be over..." In case he asks,
I just like to have an exact quote.

305
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,585
"War will be over soon."
That is great. Such good news.

306
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,965
And, um, the President would,
I know, just love...

307
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,262
Really, really love to press the flesh...

308
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,967
Not flesh, obviously,
but just maybe get a shot with, um...

309
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,346
Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

310
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,349
We could bop on Air Force One.

311
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,101
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and bop back.

312
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,306
I wouldn't get his hopes up
on that one.

313
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,390
Okay.

314
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,233
He's called Optimus Prime.

315
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,521
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

316
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:16,192
But aren't they our friends? Why?

317
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,407
Because our world
will never truly be safe

318
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,613
till all of them are gone.

319
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,543
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

320
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,080
Especially since our military
has worked so closely with them.

321
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,462
- Until you.
- It's not their planet.

322
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,962
Never was.

323
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,220
Time we take it back.

324
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,101
All right, come on. Come on.

325
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,484
Yes. Yes.

326
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,110
Yes.

327
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,282
Oh, there you go.

328
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,076
No, hold it.

329
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,155
Stop shaking! Why are you shaking?

330
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,285
You have the job!

331
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,703
You forgot to eat dinner!

332
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,079
You see why I worry?

333
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,800
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

334
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,302
I almost got it working right.

335
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,299
So, listen, I'm done with homework
and set with finals,

336
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,885
so I was just gonna take a little drive
with some friends

337
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,448
if that was okay with you.

338
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,307
No boys, I know. Graduate first.

339
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,770
Exactly.

340
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,944
You do know
no one else has this rule, right?

341
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,148
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay.
It's wisdom.

342
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,696
I don't think we need to be
driving around in the middle of the night.

343
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,869
It's already like quarter to eight.
It's almost dark.

344
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,537
Spud, will you stop it?

345
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,411
You know where I was
for my graduation?

346
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,830
Yes. With me, the mistake.

347
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,795
The surprise, Tess.
And the best thing that ever happened.

348
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,796
Do we look unhappy? Huh?
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

349
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,136
I made your mother a promise
before she passed.

350
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,923
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation.
That's it.

351
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,684
High school boys know nothing.
It's only later they turn into men.

352
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,388
So if you were older and wiser,
I wouldn't exist.

353
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,065
That's not what I meant.

354
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,900
You know, this is
a non-dating household, okay?

355
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,602
You don't date, I don't date. That's it.

356
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,854
Well, maybe you should.

357
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,573
Tessa, wait.

358
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,738
<i>Tessa'?</i>

359
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,445
Look.

360
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,657
I know I've been on you, okay?
But I have to be.

361
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,206
Twelve to seventeen
is the official teenage danger window.

362
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:35,506
It's my job to get you through it.
So you can be pissed off all you want.

363
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,847
And, yes, you can take a ride
with your friends.

364
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,264
Okay.

365
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,092
Don't work all night.

366
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,685
And eat.

367
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,080
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.

368
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,041
She's the best thing that ever happened.

369
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,202
You'd be proud.

370
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,209
Oh, no.

371
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,227
Unbelievable.

372
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,231
Unbelievable. God!

373
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,737
Something in here needs to
make this family some money.

374
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,910
Come on, you old wreck.

375
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,745
Judgment Day.

376
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,252
Where is he?

377
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,879
I don't know.

378
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,175
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

379
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,350
<i>Asshole.</i>

380
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,100
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

381
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,604
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.
Su <i>casa</i> es mi casa.

382
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,609
And we're going to lose the <i>casa.</i>

383
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,107
Dad!

384
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,696
Coming!

385
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,950
Are you working with lasers?
If so, I'm not coming in.

386
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,452
You guys have never seen
a truck like this before.

387
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,029
Get in here. Lock that door.

388
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,955
It doesn't have a lock.

389
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,761
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

390
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,205
Something blew a hole in it!

391
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,377
Yeah, so?

392
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,750
It's not normal steel.

393
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,349
The shrapnel in the engine,
it ripped all the connections apart.

394
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,005
And watch.
And this took some Cade genius.

395
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,920
You are gonna love this.

396
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,631
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

397
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,473
<i>Calling all...</i>

398
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,971
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

399
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,139
Oh, yeah.

400
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,437
I don't think it's a truck at all.

401
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,565
I think we just found a Transformer.

402
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,899
Tran... Ugh!

403
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,360
- Evacuate!
- Wait! Guys!

404
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,734
Dad, are you out of your mind?
You need to get that thing out of here.

405
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,029
You don't have to worry. I've been
in there working all night. I'm fine.

406
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,621
You know what?
That's not a truck, okay? You're right.

407
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,323
It's an alien killing machine.

408
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,658
- Dude. It's DOA.
- Jesus.

409
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,184
It's been recalled, totaled, done.

410
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,869
So, listen,
there's a number that you call.

411
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,331
You're supposed to call the government.
It's the American thing to do.

412
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,375
- Here we go.
- You're supposed to call,

413
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,801
and if it ends up being alien,

414
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,211
then you win $25,000.

415
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,511
You don't win money.

416
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,588
And if you can capture it live...

417
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,842
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest,
then you get $100,000.

418
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,302
- Dad, we're making the call.
- I heard that.

419
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,763
I've seen the commercial. They don't
say that. That's not a guarantee.

420
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,313
You think Greg would lie to me?

421
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,523
Look, if that's a Transformer there
from the Battle of Chicago,

422
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,101
I need to know how it works.

423
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,858
I'm an inventor.
This could be a game changer for me!

424
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,817
If I can apply that technology
to my inventions,

425
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,448
we'd never have to
worry about money again.

426
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,992
I've heard that before.

427
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,499
Twenty-five grand!
It pays for my college.

428
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,575
It pays for the house.

429
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,785
Besides, you used my money
to buy the truck, right?

430
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,788
So technically, that's my truck.
Don't you think?

431
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,796
You also signed a contract
regarding all research lab l.P.

432
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,211
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

433
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,045
You signed it and now you're competing.

434
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,098
Any idea of yours is mine.
Any thought you have, I own it,

435
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,884
so basically, I own you.

436
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,219
I don't think you can own someone.

437
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,517
That was, like, a while ago,
even in Texas.

438
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,992
All right. Bring the torch over
and help me with the pulley arm.

439
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,112
I think the shrapnel
took out its power core.

440
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,360
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?

441
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,487
Would an alien killing machine
let me do that?

442
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,954
Look, I'll make the call.

443
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,282
We'll get the money.
Just first let me see if I'm right.

444
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,134
You want to hide in the house?
Go ahead.

445
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,160
Okay.

446
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,208
Let's go. Pulley arm.

447
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,921
I can't believe him!

448
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,382
What is that? Looks like a missile.

449
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,845
It is! Whoa!

450
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,316
Dad!

451
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,361
There's a missile in the family room!

452
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,609
Holy...

453
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,031
I'll kill you!

454
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,712
No! No!

455
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,007
Dad, there's a missile in...

456
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,965
I'll kill you! Stay back!

457
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,051
- Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
- Call 911! Run!

458
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,520
- Lucas!
- Stop!

459
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,310
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

460
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,652
Easy, human.

461
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,363
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us.

462
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,071
<i>Weapons systems damaged.</i>

463
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,451
A missile hit your engine.

464
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,501
And we took it out of you.
You're hurt really bad.

465
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,872
I'm just trying to help you.

466
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,207
You're in my home now.
I'm an engineer.

467
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,041
My name is Cade Yeager.

468
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,720
Cade, I am in your debt.

469
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,640
My name is Optimus Prime.

470
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,306
My Autobots.

471
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,642
They're in danger.

472
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,106
I need to go. I need to go now.

473
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,525
How far you think you're gonna get?

474
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,903
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.

475
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,990
What happened to you?

476
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,495
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.

477
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,255
I escaped and took this form.

478
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,791
But you're on our side.

479
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,004
Why would humans hurt you?

480
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,463
They were not alone.

481
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,801
- My Autobots can repair me.
- Yeah.

482
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,766
If you can reach 'em.

483
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,736
What about me?

484
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,089
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth,

485
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,090
an alliance is a contract, and contracts,

486
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,475
like humans,

487
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,602
expire.

488
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,521
On this planet, we have a saying.

489
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,816
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

490
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,185
I also have a saying.

491
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,362
"I don't care."

492
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,740
So what happened in Mexico City?

493
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,067
I thought you had him.

494
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,781
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.
Then your men allowed him to escape.

495
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,833
You promised me human intelligence.

496
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,623
Or is there such a thing?

497
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,163
You know, you've still never told me.

498
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,381
Why do you want him?

499
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,334
Who are you working for?

500
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:22,264
Every galaxy I've traveled,
all you species are the same.

501
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,843
You all think
you're the center of the universe.

502
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,517
You have no idea.

503
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,066
Go to the hardware store
and you get the list.

504
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,141
The whole list.

505
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,231
What, you're going to try and fix him?

506
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,630
He's not a model train set, Cade.

507
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,154
No, that's right. He's important.

508
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,356
Yeah, but important to who?

509
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,362
You can't keep an alien
locked up in your barn.

510
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,442
What are you gonna do, play with him?

511
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,903
- Will you calm down?
- I'm trying to,

512
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,405
but I just got hit in the head
with a ten-foot cannon!

513
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,115
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

514
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,909
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me?

515
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,992
Not a single word.

516
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,456
<i>Nobody.</i>

517
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,508
I think we have a lock
on a high-value target.

518
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,342
Special Operations group is ready.

519
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,879
What do you got?

520
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,517
Sir, Special Ops just got a call
from Paris, Texas.

521
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,020
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico City.

522
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,431
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.

523
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,029
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

524
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,106
The missile just missed
your power source.

525
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,988
We call it a Spark.

526
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:28,330
It contains our life force
and our memories.

527
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,414
Yeah, we call it a soul.

528
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,502
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

529
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,797
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

530
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,295
This room is going dark.

531
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,942
The exit is on your left.

532
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,220
- I'll take it from here.
- Okay, let's go.

533
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,225
I'm with Cemetery Wind.
We're on the move.

534
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,302
<i>Repeat, on the move.</i>

535
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,942
Cade.

536
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,074
Why are you willing to help me?

537
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,365
I guess maybe because you trust me to.

538
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,505
I'm back!

539
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,098
Took you long enough!

540
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,063
My head hurts. I had to go to the doctor.

541
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,718
I got a welt on my head

542
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,224
that makes me look
like a fricking Star Trek character.

543
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,351
Whatever.

544
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,200
Look! Look!

545
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,466
We're on property.

546
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,465
<i>Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1.</i>

547
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,767
Dad!

548
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,529
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy.
I'm a federal agent.

549
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,279
My men and I are trying to track down
an abandoned truck.

550
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,161
It's a nice spread you got here.
Too bad she's for sale.

551
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,704
Well, thanks. She's not.

552
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,954
That the truck you mean?

553
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,505
Afraid not.

554
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,508
You know, Mr. Yeager,
we received a call from someone

555
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,131
concerned about this truck.

556
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,211
Oh, no.

557
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,675
That wasn't you?

558
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,591
Only thing I'm concerned about
is you being on my property

559
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,914
without permission.

560
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,974
You know, we got a rule about people
messing with people from Texas.

561
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,431
And I don't know what truck
you're talking about.

562
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,937
The kind that cost American lives.

563
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,525
Search the property!

564
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,818
What do you mean,
"Search the property"?

565
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,895
You don't have a warrant.

566
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,105
My face is my warrant.

567
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,448
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck,
we get a reward, right?

568
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,908
<i>Viper 15 holding, point alpha.</i>

569
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,877
Charlie team, hold tight.

570
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,496
<i>Lock it down.</i>

571
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,374
- Open, open, open.
- Short wall. Short wall.

572
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,958
Five in. Five in.

573
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,594
<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises.</i>

574
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,672
- What the hell is that?
- Just some dumb inventor.

575
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:14,922
Clear.

576
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
Clear.

577
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,934
Clear right.

578
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,427
Clear.

579
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,017
360. 720. Heads on a swivel.

580
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,783
Let's go. There's nothing here.

581
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,453
There's no signs. We got nothing.

582
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,955
Sir, we have a live armed missile
in the trash.

583
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,707
Live? I carried that to the trash!
You told me that was a dud, dude.

584
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,375
I could be dead. Right?

585
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,294
Look.
Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.

586
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,912
I towed it back for the parts.

587
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,802
I left it here last night.
This morning, it's gone.

588
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,224
When? Where? I don't know.
I swear to God.

589
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,699
That's as much as I know about him.

590
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,140
"Him."

591
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,101
He said, "Him."

592
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,456
<i>He knows who the son of a bitch is.</i>

593
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,486
- Mr. Yeager.
- What?

594
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,695
Excuse me.

595
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,650
You just said, "Him."

596
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,736
- Take them down.
- What?

597
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,330
Ow! Let me go!

598
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,916
They don't know about the truck! I know!
Just let her go.

599
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,918
What kind of a man
betrays his flesh-and-blood

600
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,871
brethren for alien metal?

601
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,001
- Get this guy out of my sight.
- Get off!

602
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,925
Let her go!
They don't know about the truck.

603
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,208
All right! Load up! Search the perimeter!

604
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,377
Lucas, you called, didn't you?

605
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,005
No!
I don't know any of these scary guys.

606
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,636
Oh, God! You're manhandling a woman!
I'll kick your ass!

607
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,343
Let her go!

608
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,391
- Daddy! Let me go!
- You're not going anywhere.

609
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,306
Daddy!

610
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,874
No! You're not taking me anywhere!

611
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,855
I'm an American!

612
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,899
- Easy, sweetheart.
- Okay, okay, okay.

613
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,526
All right. Okay. All right. I was wrong.

614
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,780
Savoy. Use the girl.

615
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,452
Oh, my God! Ahh!

616
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,044
Now, you got ten seconds.
Where's the truck?

617
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,259
- You're gonna shoot my little girl?
- If I have to.

618
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,575
Please don't shoot me! Please!

619
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,758
Look, I don't know. I told you
everything that I know! He's gone.

620
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,724
He left.
He was in the barn, I swear to God!

621
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,557
<i>- Just let her go!
- Ow!</i>

622
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,222
Please, please.

623
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,345
He was in there! Let her go!

624
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,684
Seven seconds.

625
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,892
I'm telling you the truth!
He was in there!

626
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,353
Dad!

627
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,069
Tell him to get away
from my little girl now!

628
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,658
Dad!

629
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,129
You touch her and I'll kill you!

630
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,109
You got two seconds.

631
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,831
I need the truth.

632
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,955
- Please.
- Shoot her.

633
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,596
Here I am!

634
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,522
- Get down!
- Ahh!

635
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:15,069
Cade!
They're going to kill you! Get out of here!

636
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,084
Push right! Headed to the house!

637
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,366
Come on. Hurry up! Get in the car!

638
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,991
- Let's go!
- Daddy, get in the car!

639
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,690
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way!

640
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,376
What's happening, baby?
Who are they?

641
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,461
It's the truck. They want the truck!

642
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,363
"Who are they"? Who are you,
and who are you calling "baby"?

643
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,215
I know you heard me.

644
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,899
- I'm her boyfriend!
- He's my boyfriend!

645
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,474
What?
You're not her boyfriend!

646
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,973
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad.

647
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,234
What kind of cars are those?
They're so scary!

648
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,910
There's another one
coming up the back!

649
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,156
You gotta try to lose them
in the cornfield!

650
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,507
He's coming up behind us! Go!

651
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,478
<i>Viper 15,
running on fumes. RTB.</i>

652
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,863
They've got us cornered!

653
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,506
Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

654
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,199
Mr. Yeager, this is not
how I wanted us to meet, okay?

655
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,670
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely...

656
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,626
And I am not talking to you!
Drive the car!

657
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,475
Watch out! Watch out!

658
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,357
<i>Throw 'em some warning shots!</i>

659
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,482
Man, I don't know how
I'm driving this good.

660
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,525
It's like, today
I've gone to a whole other level.

661
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,784
Road, focus! Stop talking!

662
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,454
Shane, look out!

663
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,917
This may be primarily my fault, okay.

664
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,374
They said
they were gonna bring a check!

665
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,377
I didn't know they were gonna send
a death squad!

666
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,053
Hang on!

667
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,268
Hey, we got ourselves a winner!
Don's got it over here.

668
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,787
Look out!

669
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,533
We lost them!
Good job, stranger from the cornfields!

670
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,993
The scary cars are back.

671
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,672
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

672
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,644
I thought you knew
how to drive this thing! Go!

673
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,358
I don't think we're gonna get that money.
Doesn't seem like it.

674
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,910
Cade!

675
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,085
Take 'em upstairs!

676
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,277
We're losing them on the fifth floor.

677
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,327
- Do that thing, Shane!
- You know it.

678
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,642
What do you mean? What thing?

679
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,644
What we're about to do
is gonna be kind of scary.

680
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,860
Take out your guns and shoot them!

681
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,034
They're shooting at us!

682
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,993
- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick!
- What?

683
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,670
She's got
the best hands in the business.

684
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,409
Ready, Tess? Pull!

685
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,591
- No! No! No!
- No f-ing way!

686
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,056
Oh! Yeah!

687
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:42,847
Yeah!

688
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,274
Tessa, you are so grounded!

689
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,102
Shit! The rim's cracked.

690
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,861
Optimus. Come on, move! Move!

691
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,110
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!

692
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,161
- Lucas!
- Wait! Wait!

693
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,369
Lucas! Lucas, above you!

694
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,120
Run!

695
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,149
Come on, get in, let's go!

696
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,154
<i>I'll bet you wish
you could see my face right now.</i>

697
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,533
Lucas, we just left him?

698
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,960
He's gone.

699
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,933
My deepest sympathies
for the loss of your friend.

700
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,736
Stay here till I'm sure
we weren't followed.

701
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,735
We are all targets now.

702
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,657
So we're hiding out now?
That's the plan?

703
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,414
We're taking orders from a truck?

704
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,416
Well, you got a better idea?

705
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,087
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't...

706
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,544
Keep your hands off her. All right? No.

707
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,598
You got your ass kicked
by a garage inventor from Texas.

708
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,428
That goes on your resume.

709
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,639
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too!

710
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,688
Do I look like I'm in the mood
for any of your shit today?

711
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,233
Washington thinks
we were chasing a Decepticon target,

712
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,312
but our story falls apart
if we don't find this Yeager family first.

713
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,064
Yeah, well, what if he goes
to the cops or the FBI?

714
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,364
They know to hand him over.

715
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,447
His world as he knows it is gone.

716
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,376
Well, bright side, you guys met.

717
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,622
Where is he from?

718
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,503
I told you, he's a driver from Texas.

719
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,629
Texas?

720
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,385
Where, Dublin, Texas?
Shamrock, Texas?

721
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,021
So why does he sound
like a leprechaun'?

722
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,473
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland
for saying that.

723
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,788
Well, we're not in Ireland,
Lucky Charms. We're in Texas.

724
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,095
And so he drives?
What do you mean, he drives?

725
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,179
Like, for a living?

726
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,270
Yeah. At least he makes a living.

727
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,060
Thank you.

728
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,978
Look, I race rally cars.

729
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,062
One driver.

730
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,819
One navigator. Her.

731
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,098
By the way, I'm totally legit.

732
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,823
I just got picked up by Red Bull.

733
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,988
And just so you know,

734
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,998
my life savings
was in that car back there.

735
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,664
- This is not happening.
- Oh, it definitely is.

736
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,802
How old are you?

737
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,462
Twenty.

738
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,506
She's a 17-year-old girl.

739
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,675
So we can work this two ways.

740
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,762
One, I punch you right in the mouth
and you call the police on me.

741
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:51,846
- Dad.
- Or two,

742
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,653
I just call the cops on you
because this is illegal. She's a minor.

743
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,526
We're protected by
the Romeo and Juliet laws.

744
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,982
We dated for a little while.

745
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,613
I was a sophomore,
and he was a senior. It's fine.

746
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:01,940
No, it's not fine.

747
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,118
We've got a preexisting
juvenile foundational relationship.

748
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,454
- Statute 22.011.
- What?

749
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,740
Texas statute?

750
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,075
- That a real law?
- Yep.

751
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,743
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

752
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,210
- You know how those two ended up?
- In love.

753
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,921
Dead. Do your parents know about this?

754
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,754
Is your dad okay with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

755
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:28,182
He took off when I was five,
but if I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.

756
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,426
You know, Tessa,

757
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,974
- I trusted you.
- To what?

758
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,225
Never have fun, take a risk,
be a normal teenager, like you?

759
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,438
I am your father, okay?

760
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,736
And I have been busting my ass
to take care of you.

761
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,614
Is that what you were doing
when you brought home the truck?

762
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,322
All you had to do was report it,
and now Lucas is dead.

763
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,950
And my life is over. Thank you.

764
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,743
You've taken real good care of me.

765
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,336
<i>Please don't shoot me!</i>

766
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,883
Please! Dad!

767
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,883
They were willing to kill her.

768
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,305
Then they still are.

769
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,730
Somebody somewhere gave
that order.

770
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,245
I'm going to find some fingerprints.

771
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,150
<i>Please!</i>

772
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:26,778
<i>No!</i>

773
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,035
<i>I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot!</i>

774
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,075
<i>Grab whatever you think
we can use for supplies.</i>

775
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,491
Clothes, anything.
And take that computer.

776
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,295
Let's go.

777
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,757
This is not easy.

778
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,170
You know,
you don't suck at everything, Dad.

779
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,435
What the...

780
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,815
I knew it.

781
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,112
You told me he was no one.

782
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,827
Well,

783
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,285
this "no one" has our tech.

784
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,746
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

785
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,113
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

786
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,729
- Whoa! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

787
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,642
That was insane!

788
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,325
It was awesome,
but it was insane, right?

789
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,578
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

790
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,957
He's back! He's alive!

791
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,960
Optimus is here!

792
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,223
At last. There is hope after all.

793
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,907
Yeah.

794
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,455
Mr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back.

795
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,959
I knew you'd make it. I never doubted.

796
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,966
We got your warning.
We've been waiting.

797
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,588
Hell, yeah. Boom time.
We got the gang back together.

798
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,868
Humans have asked us
to play by their rules.

799
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,993
Well, the rules have just changed.

800
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,667
Human beings,
bunch of backstabbin' weasels.

801
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,999
Hound, find your inner compass.

802
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,250
Loyalty is but a flower
in the winds of fear and temptation.

803
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,967
What the hell are you saying?

804
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,464
- It's a haiku.
- Cut the crap,

805
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,387
before I drop a grenade
down your throat.

806
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:18,840
Try it, you'll be dead.

807
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,549
Oh, please pull it. Please do it.

808
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,264
<i>You know what,
it'll save us so much time.</i>

809
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,016
Well, raise your hand

810
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,441
if you're thoroughly disenchanted
with our little pleasant Earth vacation.

811
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,025
So, who's the stowaways?

812
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,898
Oh, whoa, hey, what's with the gun?

813
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,605
Stop. Hound, both of you.

814
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,066
They've risked their lives for mine.

815
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,406
<i>We owe them.</i>

816
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,247
<i>So, there's been no sign of any others?</i>

817
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,700
<i>- Nada.</i>
- We are all that's left.

818
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,911
They're picking us off,
one by one.

819
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:51,793
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.
And you make five.

820
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,421
So that's our best-case scenario?

821
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,969
Autobot witness protection?

822
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,636
Hey, Speed Racer,
you're welcome to leave anytime.

823
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,222
Well, for the record, Superdad,

824
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,813
I'm not hiding with you.
I'm hiding out with that big guy.

825
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,771
Sensei, with your fate unknown,

826
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,768
Bumblebee has held command,

827
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,521
despite his complete
and total lack of anything

828
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,320
resembling warrior discipline.

829
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,445
He's like a child.

830
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,072
<i>This child is about to kick your ass.</i>

831
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,698
He brings us shame.

832
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,324
Cage fight.

833
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,574
Smartass.

834
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,958
What's the matter with them?

835
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:33,547
Am I the lone sage who sees through

836
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,421
this puppy-dog eyes act?
It's beneath you.

837
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,336
Yes, I've been waiting
for them all to dispatch each other,

838
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,513
so I could take charge
with no trouble at all.

839
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,056
Just me reporting to me.

840
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,929
Well, it sure looks like
you've been missed.

841
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,478
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us

842
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,102
and humans are helping.

843
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,517
We need to know why.

844
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,566
Well, listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.

845
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,864
This drone I stole recorded footage
of an Autobot raid.

846
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,031
It's in pieces,
but watch what happens here.

847
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,121
Oh, that's Leadfoot.

848
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,710
They rip him apart.

849
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,162
Savages.

850
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,505
And later, this truck
comes to haul him off.

851
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,924
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

852
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,301
Defense, aerospace,
government contracts.

853
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,253
They designed this drone.

854
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,013
So these government guys
just hunt you down,

855
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,761
and then pass you off to this KSI?

856
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,434
The company is headquartered
in Chicago.

857
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,136
That could be where they were taken.

858
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,142
No way to get inside without a battle.

859
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,974
Well, what if you had
some human help?

860
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,439
- What, are you two partners now?
- Sweetie, we're targets now, too.

861
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,987
We need to know why
or we'll never get our lives back.

862
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,109
Autobots,

863
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,074
I have sworn to never kill humans.

864
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,402
Big mistake.

865
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,657
But when I find out who's behind this,

866
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,907
he's going to die.

867
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,082
Hooah!

868
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,216
<i>There's a full-on
manhunt out for us,</i>

869
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,676
<i>so we have some new rules.</i>

870
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,849
<i>Anyone who has got a badge
is not our friend.</i>

871
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,847
<i>We're gonna divide and conquer.</i>

872
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,059
<i>You two in charge of stealing food
and the essentials. And nothing else.</i>

873
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,117
<i>Chicago KSI headquarters
is like a fortress.</i>

874
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,286
<i>I'm gonna find a way
into their top-secret military wing.</i>

875
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,955
<i>Find something to blackmail
this company and the government.</i>

876
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,907
<i>We're gonna get our freedom back.</i>

877
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,794
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

878
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,929
What was that sound?

879
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,227
That's "the" sound.

880
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,895
That you asked for.

881
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,484
No, I asked for boundless.
Transcendent.

882
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,897
When you walk through a door
in this building,

883
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,483
it should sound like
you've stepped into the future.

884
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,827
Present.

885
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,246
Say it.

886
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,584
Future.

887
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,748
<i>The past is history. The present is past.</i>

888
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,791
<i>The future is now.</i>

889
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,922
Why can't I get in touch with you?

890
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,930
Don't you realize
what the Arctic find means?

891
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,593
You know that story
we were all told as children

892
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,974
about a giant asteroid
that struck the Earth

893
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,431
millions of years ago
and wiped out the dinosaurs?

894
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,733
- Vaguely.
- We were wrong.

895
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,732
This metal caused the great extinction.

896
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,313
How and why, I can't yet say.

897
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,984
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years B.C.

898
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,779
This ore you've got us digging for
is a lot more dangerous than you think.

899
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:52,909
And my people...

900
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:57,084
Darcy, I think that you've been
out in the field for far too long.

901
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,120
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs
over dinner?

902
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,673
- Ribs?
- Not a chance.

903
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,210
You have no idea
what's been happening here.

904
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,171
We're about to make the quantum leap.

905
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,132
A rare-earth metal.

906
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,843
Molecularly unstable.

907
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,851
Industrial uses, none.

908
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,565
And then the aliens came.

909
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,355
And we made the connection.

910
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,194
It's what they're made of.

911
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,862
<i>It's the Holy Grail.</i>

912
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,154
"Transformium."
That's what we're calling it.

913
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,655
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

914
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:32,907
- Trademarked.
- Yeah.

915
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,449
This is the greatest advance
in modern physics

916
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,999
since the splitting of the atom.

917
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,502
It's programmable matter.

918
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,147
And now, we've mapped its genome.

919
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,673
- I.
- Now you've mapped its genome.

920
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:49,011
And now we can begin to give it

921
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,759
instructions.

922
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,224
This is extremely good.

923
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,689
Watch this.

924
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,029
We can change anything into anything.

925
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,782
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?

926
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,713
Do you like music?

927
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:26,832
The Pill.

928
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,671
Perhaps something a little more violent?

929
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,552
Oh, my God. You've done it.

930
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,476
In aerospace, the military...

931
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,479
We will own the entire robotics industry.

932
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,151
All exploration.

933
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,105
The oceans. Space. Everything.

934
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,775
Wembley. What is this?

935
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,402
The jellyfish commercial
that you wanted.

936
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,364
You said they were erotic yet deadly,
like women.

937
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,823
I never said that.

938
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,659
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

939
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,742
I definitely heard you say it

940
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,998
'cause you were talking
about your ex-girlfriend,

941
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,795
who was sexy, but a bitch.

942
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,880
Please don't eat on the tour.

943
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:09,925
Is that her?

944
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,844
Hey, I found a whole bunch
of boxes of clothes.

945
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,142
So, sweetie, you can get some
long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,

946
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,297
and lose the short shorts, okay?
What'd you guys get?

947
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:25,932
It's protein.

948
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,939
Look, I said the essentials, okay?

949
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,396
It wasn't easy. We almost got caught.

950
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,862
You stole mouthwash?

951
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,219
I like to be fresh
when I'm making out with your daughter.

952
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,902
That's funny.

953
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,207
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

954
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,868
Ever?

955
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,122
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.

956
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,833
I don't understand it.

957
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,385
This is the fifth iteration.

958
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,020
Why does he keep turning out like this?

959
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,638
It's just some bugs in the final render.

960
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,847
I modeled Galvatron
after Optimus Prime.

961
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,271
Why does he keep looking
like Megatron?

962
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,974
<i>Rendering sequence
is almost finished. Stand by.</i>

963
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,684
Simple coding.

964
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,775
Algorithms!

965
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,027
Math!

966
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,447
Why can't we make
what we want to make,

967
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,450
the way we want to make it?

968
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,123
Why?

969
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,875
And does that look
like a consumer-friendly face to you?

970
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,966
And what about that
big hole in the chest?

971
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,301
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

972
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,887
- Love it.
- Well, I hate it.

973
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,516
Oh, here he is.

974
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,056
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.

975
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,939
Ma'am, this is not legal.
This is illegal experimentation.

976
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,021
Aliens would never do this to people!

977
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,700
Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it.

978
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,104
This ain't right!
Nobody puts baby in a box!

979
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,440
Ahhh!

980
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,011
This is worse than waterboarding!

981
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,035
This little gentleman
has been translating for us

982
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,575
all the information
that comes from these two heads.

983
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,491
Their history, their science, everything.

984
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,997
- Is that Megatron?
- Precisely.

985
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,875
Where did you get all this?

986
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,581
Special government contract.

987
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,512
Now we know everything
about Transformers.

988
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,382
And now at long last
we can build them ourselves.

989
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,338
And we can build them better.

990
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,245
Yeah, that's good, Bee. That'll get us in.

991
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,959
<i>A couple times a day,
these guys are moving</i>

992
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,788
<i>in vehicle shipments into KSI
for something called "scanning-"</i>

993
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,668
Major security all over.

994
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,252
So our best shot at getting in
is a back classified research entrance.

995
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,463
<i>I'm gonna drive in with Bee
tomorrow morning.</i>

996
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,305
Excuse me.

997
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,102
There's no smooching
in front of me, okay?

998
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,018
You're so square.
Who even says "smooching"?

999
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,849
I tell you, no respect.

1000
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,605
It's just impossible sometimes.

1001
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,608
Yeah. I went through that
with Bumblebee.

1002
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,489
Calm down. Calm down.

1003
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,616
You know, at a time like this,

1004
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,669
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?

1005
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:35,793
About a month ago,

1006
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,087
Middle of the night,
I thought I heard noises in my house.

1007
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,419
Was that you?

1008
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,549
What? Come on. No way.

1009
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:42,629
Don't lie to me, kid.

1010
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,771
You see that guy with the gun out there?

1011
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,890
There's so many guys with guns.

1012
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:46,966
Let's get out of the car and tell him

1013
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,302
we're about to break in
and it's your idea,

1014
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,479
'cause I don't care.
I'm old, I've already lived long enough.

1015
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,758
You have a really bad habit

1016
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,352
of having these conversations
at the wrong time, man.

1017
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,851
You want to come clean
or you want me to make a mess?

1018
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:57,477
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

1019
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,365
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

1020
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,695
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1021
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,323
- Taking it in for scanning?
- Uh-huh.

1022
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,453
All right. You're good to go.

1023
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,159
I'm literally gonna kill you.

1024
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,169
<i>Scanning in bay three.</i>

1025
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,825
We <i>took</i> old, alien technology

1026
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,459
<i>and made it better in every way.</i>

1027
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,339
<i>Introducing Stinger.</i>

1028
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,632
<i>KSI. We make the world.</i>

1029
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,140
That is a bad-ass robot.

1030
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,046
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

1031
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,478
<i>Here is the past. And now the future.</i>

1032
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,858
They're trying to build
their own versions.

1033
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,528
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars
than this.

1034
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,607
<i>You talk to me like that?</i>

1035
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,775
Bee, stop!

1036
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,203
You see what happens
from being a wiseass?

1037
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,222
<i>- Now get out of here.</i>

1038
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,911
<i>Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee,</i>

1039
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,076
<i>but better in every way.</i>

1040
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,207
Son of a...

1041
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,647
No, no! You gotta calm down.

1042
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,003
- He's crazy!
- Stop!

1043
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,877
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho!

1044
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,965
OUR FACTORY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH
TRANSFORMIUM FOR PRODUCTION...

1045
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,342
<i>...BECAUSE YOU DON'T KEEP
YOUR PROMISE TO SUPPLY IT.</i>

1046
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,303
My delicate flower, I can't
understand you when you're angry.

1047
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,518
Actually, I don't really understand you
at all.

1048
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,810
Our entire factory
is up and running...

1049
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,393
Excuse me one second. Hey!

1050
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,649
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

1051
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,065
What the hell is going on here? Huh?

1052
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,348
What's with this vintage crap?

1053
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,614
We're not scanning collector car junk.

1054
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,412
What do you think it is
that we make here? Hmm?

1055
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,040
We make poetry. We're poets.

1056
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:38,086
All right? You work for me,
you get one mistake. One. Understood?

1057
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,629
- It won't happen again.
- It certainly won't.

1058
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,291
So let's get this pathetic thing
out of here.

1059
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:43,879
And you, too.

1060
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,586
So sorry. So sorry.

1061
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:47,800
Let's move on.

1062
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,138
Watch him.
I'm going to see what I can find.

1063
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,511
Quietly get out of here.

1064
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,492
I swear. I swear.
I can't bear it when you're angry.

1065
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,057
You know how it upsets me.

1066
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,691
Bee, you gotta calm down right now.

1067
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,771
<i>I'm perfectly calm, dude.</i>

1068
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,277
You gotta breathe,
or just do whatever it is that you do.

1069
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,155
<i>I'm calm. I'm calm.
I'm not even touching it.</i>

1070
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:10,952
<i>Okay, I'm barely touching it.
I'm barely touching it.</i>

1071
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,529
Oh, my God.
Turn back into a car right now!

1072
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:13,655
<i>Get out of my face, all right?</i>

1073
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:14,830
Our design <i>team</i>

1074
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,579
<i>started with the Bumblebee.</i>

1075
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,286
<i>But really,
this alien's design was decrepit</i>

1076
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,621
<i>and, let's face it, antique.</i>

1077
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,209
<i>What the...</i>

1078
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,173
<i>- Don't take it personally, Bee.
- Kind of old and ratty.</i>

1079
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,717
<i>You mean ugly.</i>

1080
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,632
<i>- Oh, hell, no!
- No! No!</i>

1081
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,672
<i>You think you're better than me!</i>

1082
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,470
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

1083
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:39,939
What did you touch?

1084
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,479
Uh...

1085
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,150
<i>I told you, homeboy
Can't touch this</i>

1086
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,489
My office in 15 minutes.

1087
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,533
<i>This is dissection room seven.</i>

1088
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,737
<i>Galvatron,
render postmortem number 12.</i>

1089
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,620
<i>Continued head disfigurement
at event number 32.</i>

1090
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,964
So what about the deal? Is it done?

1091
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,040
Did you get the Seed?

1092
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,546
We get it
when the bounty hunter gets Prime.

1093
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,626
Uh-huh.

1094
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,133
Meanwhile,
there has been a complication.

1095
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,464
A what?

1096
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,137
No, no.

1097
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,889
At KSI, we don't use words like that.

1098
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,599
A civilian harboring the Autobots has
hacked into one of your mini-drones.

1099
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:24,522
Meaning, they may know
of your involvement.

1100
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,227
What?

1101
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,077
That was a little bit intense.

1102
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,450
I need more Transformium, and
I need it now, to build more prototypes.

1103
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,160
You tell your alien bounty hunter

1104
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,214
that I have staked my company
on this deal.

1105
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,249
And I have merely staked my life.

1106
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,710
Hey, you came to me on this,
remember?

1107
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,803
You retire from the CIA,

1108
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,758
you get a seven-figure piece
of my company, and you and I

1109
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,011
revolutionize national defense together.

1110
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:03,440
But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes,

1111
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,730
you need to deliver

1112
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,354
the Seed.

1113
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,081
<i>I'm in. Can you see my camera?</i>

1114
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,047
<i>They're melting Ratchet.</i>

1115
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,087
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1116
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,344
I'm gonna tear them apart!

1117
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,054
Metal.

1118
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,478
Just metal.
That's what I always thought of them.

1119
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,389
Well, they're not.

1120
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,395
They're living things,
with souls like ours.

1121
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,436
Once, I spoke to one.

1122
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,980
And you're working with Transformium?

1123
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,075
Uh, yeah, that's what I do. I am.

1124
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,824
I'm out there digging for it.
There's just not much left to find.

1125
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,324
So that's how badly
you boys need more, huh?

1126
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,167
Reduced to melting
evil old Decepticons down.

1127
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,462
No. That's an Autobot there.

1128
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:10,794
The ones who fought for us.

1129
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,460
- I've got this taken care of from here.
- Right.

1130
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,545
Same badge code scanned
at two separate gates.

1131
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,097
I'm having the classified area
locked down now.

1132
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:26,806
Check that guy.

1133
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,401
Hey!

1134
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,361
Stop right there!

1135
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,692
Stop!

1136
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,745
Freeze!

1137
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,916
Up against the wall.

1138
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,675
All right.

1139
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:55,464
Corporate espionage.
That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

1140
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,688
Wow.

1141
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,743
Look, I want a lawyer.

1142
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,946
The Justice Department.
Somebody I can trust.

1143
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,288
I'm just trying to protect my family,
okay?

1144
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,286
Not from your company,
from the government.

1145
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,537
Mr. Yeager,

1146
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,497
who do you think I work for?

1147
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,789
You're trying to protect your family,
that's admirable.

1148
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,966
I'm trying to defend the nation
from alien war.

1149
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,259
We've had a taste
of what that looks like,

1150
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,554
and we are not gonna tolerate another.
Now...

1151
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:44,639
There is a version of this conversation
where you get to go back to your barn,

1152
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,647
your daughter
gets to graduate with honors,

1153
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,188
and life <i>as</i> you know it will go on.

1154
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,522
You have no idea
what you're involved with here.

1155
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,313
Really?

1156
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,490
What's the other version
of this conversation?

1157
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,576
The one when you send in
the hired help to murder my little girl?

1158
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,447
Or you gonna man up
and do it yourself?

1159
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,747
What's your preference?

1160
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,578
I'm going to ask you this once.

1161
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,835
Where is Optimus Prime?

1162
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,745
<i>Come on.
Let's get out of here.</i>

1163
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,123
We're moving. Basement.

1164
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,123
They're here.

1165
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,966
Get out! All of you!

1166
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,387
Science fair's over, meatbags!

1167
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,714
- Destroy the lab!
- Move, move, move, move!

1168
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,225
Look out! Look out!

1169
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,136
Destroy it all!

1170
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:15,563
Danger! Security breach!
Danger...

1171
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,439
Guys! It's me!

1172
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,316
Break me out of this Frankenstein box!

1173
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,692
Hey!

1174
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:21,772
Hey!

1175
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:24,700
Hey!

1176
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,031
Stop!

1177
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,703
That's company property!

1178
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,156
They're not your property!

1179
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,627
They were my friends.

1180
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,376
Oh, you ain't talking so much now!
You got Hound in front of you, huh?

1181
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:42,710
Go ahead.

1182
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,849
Show us your true colors,
once and for all.

1183
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,346
Just give me the word, I'll splatter him.

1184
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,930
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here
that this is all the spoils of war.

1185
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,013
Dead metal.

1186
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,980
Innovation. What we do here is science.

1187
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:02,154
Because if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

1188
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,528
Because you cannot stop technology!

1189
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,826
We're not your technology!

1190
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,826
Let me vaporize his ass.

1191
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:19,335
I broke the code.
I own your whole genome.

1192
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,880
The world will know
what you're doing here.

1193
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:26,255
The world? The world will approve.

1194
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,881
We can make you now.

1195
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:33,224
Don't you get it?
We don't need you anymore.

1196
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,555
That was cruel.

1197
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:42,774
Autobots,

1198
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,903
we're done.

1199
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,780
We're done?
We're not gonna kick a little bit of <i>ass?</i>

1200
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,907
I've been itching
to kill something lately.

1201
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,660
This is our chance.
We have to stop him.

1202
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,864
You have to stop him.

1203
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,388
It's never been tested in the field.

1204
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,661
Labs, military bases,
but not on civilian streets.

1205
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,370
Down there
a Defense Department contract

1206
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,126
was just attacked in a terrorist attack.

1207
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,917
This is now a CIA military op.

1208
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,382
You're indemnified. Respond!

1209
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,763
Let's go.

1210
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,188
KSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in.

1211
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,731
Been an unprovoked Autobot attack.

1212
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,524
Bring up Galvatron.

1213
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,941
Transforming Galvatron.

1214
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,440
<i>Galvatron coming online.</i>

1215
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,531
<i>Bring up Stinger.</i>

1216
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,447
<i>Stinger coming online.</i>

1217
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,964
Let's show these alien terrorists
what an upgrade looks like.

1218
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,629
<i>Galvatron and Stinger are moving</i>

1219
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:47,881
<i>to intercept targets.</i>

1220
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,602
<i>Reapers.
Five targets in the open. Good picture.</i>

1221
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,604
Two miles to intercept.

1222
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,755
200 meters.

1223
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,532
Engage.

1224
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,120
Transform.

1225
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,176
Whoa.

1226
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,776
We are programming this, right?

1227
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,899
Yes. Mostly.

1228
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,481
<i>Systems seem to have malfunctioned.</i>

1229
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,650
Targeting five bogeys.

1230
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:54,694
Engaging rockets.

1231
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:55,903
Missiles away.

1232
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,510
Gotta haul <i>ass,</i> Bee! Come on!

1233
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,768
<i>Stinger is in pursuit.</i>

1234
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,396
Misfire, misfire! Misfire, misfire!

1235
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,732
System failure.
Galvatron just fired four rockets.

1236
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,575
Whoa! They're shooting at us!

1237
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,941
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Watch out! What are you doing?

1238
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,948
<i>Argh!</i>

1239
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,118
<i>What was that?</i>

1240
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,516
We need a full medical team now.
Possible civilian casualties.

1241
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,874
I mean, you got a lot of people
in the crossfire here. I don't like...

1242
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,209
You're making history here.
For your country, for the world.

1243
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,340
Human freedom is at stake.

1244
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,421
Innocent people die all the time.

1245
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:45,642
Come on, Optimus!

1246
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,840
Tessa!

1247
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,931
Make him fight. Don't let him go down.

1248
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,177
Make him fight!

1249
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,318
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

1250
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,861
Tessa!

1251
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:36,981
Tessa!

1252
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,361
Tessa, run to the field!

1253
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,620
You have no soul!

1254
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,288
That is why I have no fear!

1255
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,623
You die!

1256
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,557
Help me!

1257
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,995
What is that?

1258
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,291
That's my asset. Pull Galvatron back.

1259
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,674
Do it.

1260
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,074
I got to go get her.

1261
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,083
Tessa!

1262
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,813
Don't go out there! He'll kill you!

1263
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,925
- She needs my help!
- She's hidden!

1264
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,968
Optimus! Optimus, get up, get up!

1265
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,805
I can't. Get out of here.

1266
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:32,559
I feel sorry for you, Prime.
Your allegiance to these humans.

1267
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:39,316
The trouble with loyalty to a cause
is that the cause will always betray you.

1268
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,318
Who sent you here?

1269
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,821
Where do you think you came from?

1270
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,652
You think you were born?

1271
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,573
No. You were built.

1272
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,625
And your creators want you back.

1273
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,829
We all work for someone.

1274
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,674
No, no.

1275
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:10,843
No.

1276
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:12,511
It's got her!

1277
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,888
- She's in the car!
- Tessa!

1278
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,689
- No!
- Tessa!

1279
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,404
Dad!

1280
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,731
Tessa, get out!

1281
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,863
Get out!

1282
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:28,952
Tessa!

1283
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,416
Get out! Tessa!

1284
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,658
Dad, help me!

1285
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,420
- Tessa!
- Help me, help me! Dad! Dad!

1286
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,384
Dad!

1287
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,344
- Dad!
- Tessa! Break the glass!

1288
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,593
- Break the glass to get out!
- I'm trying!

1289
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,932
- Tessa, I can't hold on!
- Dad!

1290
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,217
Tessa!

1291
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,595
- Help me!
- Just break it! Break the glass!

1292
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:55,804
Tess...

1293
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,944
Cade, warn the Autobots!

1294
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,738
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!

1295
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,737
No!

1296
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,772
Take that human to the trash.

1297
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,614
Mr. Secretary.

1298
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:56,081
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

1299
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,704
<i>This is</i> my <i>asset.</i>

1300
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,628
Tell the military to stand down.

1301
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,025
Hang on, I have the White House.

1302
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,331
<i>Agent, hello!</i>

1303
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,540
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1304
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,964
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement
over here at the White House.

1305
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,387
Everybody is super, super mad. At me.

1306
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,305
So, I went over my notes
from our last meeting,

1307
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,225
and I'm not sure
when you said anything about

1308
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,098
a "giant alien warship
over Michigan Avenue."

1309
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,475
Tell the President this is not an attack.

1310
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,231
Remember this ship, Prime?

1311
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,067
Built for all you Knights,
you great crusaders,

1312
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,323
to explore the universe.

1313
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,328
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

1314
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:35,631
Optimus?

1315
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:46,600
Welcome back
to the Knights' Temenos, Prime.

1316
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:51,029
You have disgraced it.

1317
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:59,789
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.

1318
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,868
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst.

1319
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,372
It's taken centuries,

1320
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,840
but I've collected all the Knights but you.

1321
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,968
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

1322
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,315
I'm slave to no one.

1323
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:32,479
All this species mixing with species.

1324
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,361
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1325
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:37,738
The creators, they don't like it.

1326
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:42,156
They built you to do what you were told.

1327
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,891
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1328
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,991
Come on, Bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it!

1329
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,210
<i>Savoy, mission accomplished.</i>

1330
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,132
<i>Lockdown has Prime.
The deal's going down now.</i>

1331
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,018
Picking up the Seed at the recon point.

1332
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,777
<i>Nest,</i> Talon.
L.Z. appears clear.

1333
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,129
Much as I've enjoyed the hunt,

1334
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,927
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1335
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:41,223
Our deal is done.
One Prime for one Seed.

1336
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,677
Handle it with care.

1337
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:51,483
I trust your species is ready.

1338
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,648
Don't worry about our species.

1339
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:56,613
Farewell, Earth.

1340
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,200
Come on, come on!

1341
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,379
Bee, come on!

1342
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:26,886
It's a bad idea.
But I'm all about bad ideas.

1343
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:28,979
Let's go!

1344
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,274
Well, let's rock.

1345
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,124
This is crazy.

1346
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,705
Look, you wanna cut and run,
you better do it now.

1347
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,131
I'm gonna die trying.

1348
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,884
Hey, I'm not here to help you
get your daughter.

1349
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,599
You're here to help me get my girlfriend.

1350
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:06,600
Engage dark-matter drives. Full power.

1351
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,361
We're behind enemy lines now.

1352
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:21,690
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.
Eyes open.

1353
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,652
Beware of his bone grinders,
brain blinders, flesh peelers,

1354
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:25,735
chromosomal inverters,

1355
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:29,323
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors,
and, of course, radiation.

1356
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:32,376
We must be quick.
We have the element of surprise.

1357
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,169
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.

1358
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:37,960
Oh, get it!

1359
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:39,207
I kill you! Kill you!

1360
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,884
Ugh. I hate those things.

1361
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,337
- That's freaky.
- He's not alive anymore.

1362
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,843
Well, we looked.
They're not here. Let's go.

1363
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,262
What'? Hey, I'm not going
anywhere without Tessa.

1364
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,890
I'm unclear. What's in it for me?

1365
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,937
What's in it for you?

1366
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:56,316
Easy. Let's use words.

1367
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,565
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.

1368
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,114
We're getting the boss back.
And the girl. Copy?

1369
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,074
Okay, okay.
Very persuasive. Textbook machismo.

1370
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,997
Well, then.
We'll need to sabotage something.

1371
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,918
Better hurry. Because dark-matter
drives are preparing to take off.

1372
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,413
- Oh, wonderful.
- I give us 10 minutes.

1373
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,589
Is that what that sound is?
The engines filling up'?

1374
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,344
Are you telling me
that thing's gonna be...

1375
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,047
This is gonna be flying out of here
in 10 minutes?

1376
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,252
Uh-huh.
- Ten minutes?

1377
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:25,697
Could be nine. Worst case, seven.

1378
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,973
- Humans, search the cell blocks.
- We're wasting time, let's go.

1379
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:30,267
- We'll find the center core.
- Let's move.

1380
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,435
We're gonna stop this nightmare ship.

1381
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,653
We're never gonna find her
in this huge ship.

1382
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,659
Like a needle in a haystack.

1383
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:53,957
Tessa!

1384
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,501
Great. Great.

1385
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,671
Oh, that was smooth.

1386
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:03,466
No, that was really smooth,
letting everybody know we're here.

1387
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:05,214
Now they're gonna be looking for us.

1388
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:17,394
Better hurry, Crosshairs,
before we go into space!

1389
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,066
Ah. Here's the little jujube right here.

1390
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:23,444
Hello, Mama.

1391
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,746
Who fired the anchors?

1392
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,917
Who's on my ship?
We have a loose prisoner.

1393
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:51,340
Hurry up. We got like six minutes.

1394
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:52,470
We'll find her.

1395
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:55,718
Hold up.

1396
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,314
Back up.

1397
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,431
Come on, these things
are gonna find us. Hurry, hide.

1398
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,324
Whoa!

1399
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:02,660
Weapons!

1400
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:05,626
Come here. Help me. Hurry, hurry.

1401
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:12,971
Help me up.

1402
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:15,552
There are some weird sounds out there.

1403
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,054
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1404
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,513
You ready?

1405
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:04,931
Run.

1406
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:10,986
Oh!

1407
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,112
All right, we're not going down
without a fight.

1408
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,409
They turn that corner,
and we're gonna take them.

1409
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,489
You ready
or you gonna bitch out on me?

1410
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:22,620
No, I got your back.

1411
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:23,951
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

1412
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:28,083
Don't bitch out on me.
Are you ready?

1413
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:29,330
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1414
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,918
Whoa, okay! I surrender!
I surrender! I surrender!

1415
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:40,341
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so sorry!

1416
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:41,684
What'd you do? How'd you do that?

1417
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:42,969
I have no idea!

1418
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,681
You no-good, chickenshit little rat!

1419
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,312
Look at that. You see that? Oh!

1420
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:49,483
Whoa!

1421
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,270
You stay here, Lucky Charms!

1422
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:13,626
Oh, man. I am so gonna patent this shit.

1423
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:27,685
Ew!

1424
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:29,649
Tess!

1425
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,485
Dad! Help me!

1426
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:33,936
Hey!

1427
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,397
- Tess?
- Tess!

1428
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:42,327
Come on, move, move!

1429
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,618
Tessa!

1430
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:47,367
Shane, I love you! I love you!
You saved me! You saved me!

1431
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,451
I know. I know.

1432
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,004
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1433
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,466
- Thank you. You saved me.
- Oh, yeah, he saved you. Yeah.

1434
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,793
Yeah.

1435
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,424
I think you and Mr. "I Surrender"
have a lot to catch up about, sweetie.

1436
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,218
He saved me, too.
You should have seen him in there.

1437
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:04,517
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.

1438
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:07,057
- Eyes open.
- I almost got it.

1439
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,106
Big boy coming through!
Move, move, move.

1440
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,228
Whoa!

1441
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:15,570
This has got to be
the Supermax. Watch the corners.

1442
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,526
There's a lot of cages.

1443
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,695
Oh, yeah.
Creepy critters in here.

1444
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:22,197
I don't want to know
what's in the big cage.

1445
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,996
- What's this?
- Hound, don't do it.

1446
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:27,449
Aw, you don't look
very dangerous in there.

1447
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:31,669
Oh, that's festering ugliness.

1448
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,672
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting!

1449
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:35,748
It burns!

1450
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,627
Ugh, I think it's acid!

1451
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:43,090
Ah, nuts. It's just shizzle.

1452
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:45,015
I hope that's not contagious.

1453
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:48,061
I got to hurt you now.
You're just too disturbing to live.

1454
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,146
Take that, bitch!

1455
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,103
Oh! You're dead.

1456
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,442
- Hound!
- He's alive!

1457
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:56,815
Hold on, boss, we're coming!

1458
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,067
- Optimus, sound off!
- In here, quick!

1459
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,490
Han on,
we're comin for you!

1460
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,317
The arms of this Knight Ship detach!

1461
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,370
We can break free! It's a separate ship!
Hurry!

1462
01:37:05,445 --> 01:37:06,845
Where's the cockpit? Right or left?

1463
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:08,201
- Right!
- I'm on it, boss.

1464
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,329
Hurry. We have no time.

1465
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:11,409
<i>Sensei.</i>

1466
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:15,330
Let's rock! I always wanted
to fly one of these things.

1467
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:16,756
I'm there, boss!

1468
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,503
Hey, Yeager Technologies,

1469
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,964
you gonna invent us
a way out of this one?

1470
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,136
Oh!

1471
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,431
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

1472
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:35,934
I am not doing this.

1473
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:38,107
- I am not doing that.
- Yes, we are.

1474
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:41,235
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on.

1475
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:42,944
No way.

1476
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:44,859
Sweetie, you know why I'm here?
I'm here to protect you.

1477
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,149
You've done great at that.

1478
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,966
I want you to trust me right now.
We're getting down. Let's go.

1479
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:57,713
Don't look down, okay? Step.
See, it's easy. Come on.

1480
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,898
Careful, these cables
are starting to get thinner here!

1481
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,721
- Step. Step. There.
- Oh, my God!

1482
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,425
See, don't look down!
All right? Don't look down.

1483
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:10,806
We're gonna be at the building
in no time!

1484
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:13,270
You okay, Tess?

1485
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,272
Keep stepping.

1486
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:18,188
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Dad! Oh!

1487
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:25,282
All right, sweetie.
You need to keep moving here, okay?

1488
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,110
- Come on!
- I can't.

1489
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,029
I'm freaking out.

1490
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,238
You need to move now!

1491
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:33,833
I'm not moving!
I'm going back to the ship!

1492
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:37,948
Oh, shit!

1493
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,018
You can't go back to the ship, honey!

1494
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:41,040
Watch me!

1495
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,175
You are not 18 years old yet
and you're gonna do what I say!

1496
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:44,252
Now let's go!

1497
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:54,391
We need to go this way, okay.
Not that way.

1498
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:55,889
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!

1499
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,181
Come on, for God's sake.

1500
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:58,809
Do not start with me.

1501
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:05,364
Oh, my God, what is that?

1502
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:06,649
All right, Tessa.

1503
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,408
Don't look back.

1504
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,699
Well, don't say that to me.
Now I want to turn around.

1505
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:12,246
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1506
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:14,123
Well, that means it's totally major!

1507
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:15,617
I'm gonna have to point this gun
in your direction.

1508
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,249
It's gonna feel like it's in
your direction, but I'm not.

1509
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,667
- You better hurry.
- Are you trying to kill me?

1510
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,462
I had to bust my ass
to get up here on this spaceship!

1511
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,210
- Shoot it!
- Get down now!

1512
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:48,029
Tessa, wait!
I'm coming for you! Tessa! Oh!

1513
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,328
- Oh, my God!
- I'm coming!

1514
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,171
Hold on!

1515
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,443
You're the best, Bee! You are the best.

1516
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,866
<i>You damn right! And don't ever forget it.</i>

1517
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,239
You see that? Look at me!
We're off the ship, right?

1518
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,863
Bumblebee!
Bumblebee! Friendly!

1519
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:38,871
Enemy ships are coming in hot.
Get on! Get on!

1520
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,004
Oh!

1521
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,003
Hold your knickers, I'm punching it!

1522
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,341
They got three ships on them!

1523
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,522
I'm giving it the juice!

1524
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:11,524
Come on, Bee, take them out!

1525
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:17,822
Good move, Bee!

1526
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:20,533
This one's for you, A-holes!

1527
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,015
If you're gonna do something,
you better do it!

1528
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:37,679
Come on!

1529
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:42,813
I'm sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot.

1530
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:45,976
Hey, you better let me fire
this big-ass gun

1531
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,058
- and make this ship go faster!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1532
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:52,064
Listen up! Crash course. Tracer guns.

1533
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:55,117
Punch forward to fire,
slide back to reload.

1534
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:56,193
What?

1535
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,237
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1536
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,789
Wait. What're you talking about?

1537
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,081
- I don't know what he means.
- Good luck.

1538
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:02,745
Where are you going?

1539
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,286
To lay some hate.

1540
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,378
- Say it!
- Okay.

1541
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:16,513
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1542
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:17,886
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1543
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,050
- Go!

1544
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,063
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!

1545
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,275
These alien guns kick ass!

1546
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:40,033
Come on, he's on us!

1547
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:41,656
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

1548
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,665
Bee, fire the gun!

1549
01:42:58,089 --> 01:42:59,511
<i>BUMBLEBEE'. Uh-Oh!</i>

1550
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1551
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1552
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:16,991
That was insane!

1553
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:19,356
Tess, you okay?

1554
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,662
Okay. Sir?

1555
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,174
You better have insurance!

1556
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,803
Insurance?

1557
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,679
It's a freaking spaceship.

1558
01:43:40,172 --> 01:43:41,932
You go get insurance
on a freaking spaceship.

1559
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,046
Good luck with that, buddy.

1560
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,229
Is this your car? Huh?

1561
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,480
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1562
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,529
Here you go.

1563
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:55,104
Come here.

1564
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:57,690
- Trust your dad.
- Okay.

1565
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:07,659
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1566
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,794
We're almost ready to separate.
We're almost there.

1567
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:20,037
- Hurry, he's launching!
- All over it, chief.

1568
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:23,174
Lockdown will be in deep space
before he realizes I'm gone.

1569
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:25,680
I'm a sucky pilot, but
let's give it a whirl.

1570
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,182
Hell, yeah!

1571
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,818
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1572
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:40,612
What a deft hand.
I'm sure nobody noticed all that.

1573
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,705
Look. In a few minutes, there are
gonna be feds all over this place,

1574
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,951
and I don't want them
finding our Holy Grail.

1575
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:49,159
So we're gonna take all our R&D,
we're moving it to our China facility.

1576
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:50,288
Yeah.

1577
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:54,042
I want you to bring me the Seed,
but I want you to bring it to me there.

1578
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:59,377
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe
your product testing as perfected.

1579
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,925
We have plenty of time
for improvements in China.

1580
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:05,845
Sir, Galvatron. He was...

1581
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,142
A fiasco.

1582
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,179
A farrago. An embarrassment.

1583
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:13,186
And he spoke. How did that happen?

1584
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:14,985
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley?
A flaw?

1585
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:18,571
A flaw is a total failure.

1586
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:23,902
I did not have control over my prototype,
and I want to know why!

1587
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:46,223
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.
We got a ship now. We're leaving.

1588
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:50,682
You humans. After all we have done.

1589
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,514
You don't know
what you've wrought upon yourselves.

1590
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:55,850
What? What is it now?
What are you talking about?

1591
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,733
I mean, I'm doing stuff
out of my league here!

1592
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,192
You don't see who's controlling who.

1593
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:04,071
Within that manmade prototype I fought,

1594
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:07,028
I sensed the presence

1595
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,704
of Megatron.

1596
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,991
What, the Decepticon that
started the Chicago war?

1597
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:15,203
How do you think KSI
built those bots in the first place, hmm?

1598
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,754
They had a whole mess of

1599
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,007
<i>dead Decepticon heads
and they were downloading their minds!</i>

1600
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,214
<i>And I was in charge of autopsy duty.</i>

1601
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:25,053
<i>No union, no benefits, no nothing.</i>

1602
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,972
<i>They hooked me up to Megatron,</i>

1603
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:29,225
<i>and that mind
wasn't as dead as they thought.</i>

1604
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,394
<i>He fed them the science and specs!</i>

1605
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:34,267
<i>All so they could build him
a brand-new body.</i>

1606
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:38,939
<i>Then he infected it
with his evil, nasty chromosomes.</i>

1607
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,148
<i>They had red, beady eyes.
They got all in my lovely locks.</i>

1608
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:45,653
<i>Oh, I can smell it right now.</i>

1609
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:47,985
<i>Total inside custom job!</i>

1610
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:53,412
KSI might have named the body
the snappy name of Galvatron,

1611
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:56,334
but that's just Megatron reincarnated!

1612
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,333
You knew this
and you didn't warn them?

1613
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:02,758
Little girl, you can go to a pretty
dark place when you on death row.

1614
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,336
He's been playing KSI all this time,

1615
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:09,181
all so that he could manipulate them
into going after the Seed.

1616
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,301
Wait. The Seed?

1617
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:14,853
Those nasty soldiers
that were chasing us.

1618
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,059
<i>I saw them board the ship,</i>

1619
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,516
<i>and they took something
that they called the Seed.</i>

1620
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:21,435
Listen. Sixty million years ago,
give or take an eon...

1621
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:25,114
Thousands of planets
were cyber-formed with Seeds.

1622
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:33,410
<i>They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.</i>

1623
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:39,288
<i>Our creators destroyed your world
to make us.</i>

1624
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:42,631
And that's what Galvatron
wants to happen again.

1625
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:46,962
He wants to detonate that Seed
in the biggest city and kill millions!

1626
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:49,930
He's gonna show the world,
"Baby, I'm back."

1627
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:54,765
The blast wave will incinerate
that city into molten metal.

1628
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:58,064
He'll have enough
to build a massive army

1629
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:01,935
and annihilate your species forever.

1630
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:05,025
You dumb, greedy bastards
just brought extinction to yourself.

1631
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,823
Not my problem, though.
I'm free at last.

1632
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:10,117
Whole thing worked out good for me.
I'm walking.

1633
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:12,570
We got to get the Seed
before Galvatron does.

1634
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:30,087
<i>The Seed is going to be
the salvation of our company.</i>

1635
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:32,965
We take delivery tonight.

1636
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:36,136
And next month, we detonate safely
in the Mongolian desert.

1637
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:40,606
And we'll create enough Transformium
for a hundred years.

1638
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,030
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing.

1639
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:49,823
Well, a place to sleep.

1640
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:51,946
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1641
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:59,054
You know, when I was your age,

1642
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:02,962
I liked to get a little wild.
I liked cars, girls.

1643
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:08,839
But then there was Tessa.

1644
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:11,261
And when she was born,
all I ever wanted out of life

1645
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:13,430
was for her to be happy
and healthy and safe.

1646
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,434
Somehow I thought I'd always
be enough to protect her.

1647
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:20,888
But I won't be.

1648
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,807
I'll never be.

1649
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,318
So somebody better be.

1650
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,150
Thanks for being here today,
Lucky Charms.

1651
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,826
Well, thanks for not shooting me
when you had the chance.

1652
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:40,407
Oh, I'll have more.

1653
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:44,124
Yeah, I can see that.

1654
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:48,166
We've intercepted
the encrypted communications.

1655
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:52,845
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory
in Guangzhou, China.

1656
01:49:53,378 --> 01:49:55,005
Hey, big shot.

1657
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,266
Your company's in serious trouble.

1658
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:00,098
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1659
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:01,178
<i>Really?</i>

1660
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,479
Well, you better have a great one 'cause

1661
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:05,103
you're about to be responsible
for the annihilation of a city.

1662
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:06,399
<i>Now, you listen to me.</i>

1663
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:08,728
<i>Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.</i>

1664
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:11,109
And now Galvatron is after that Seed.

1665
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:14,609
<i>Look. I know you have a conscience
because you're an inventor, like me.</i>

1666
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:17,615
<i>Do not let Galvatron
anywhere near that Seed.</i>

1667
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:20,163
I control Galvatron. I created him.

1668
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:22,332
Deep down, I know you know.

1669
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,828
<i>Your prototype's been controlling you.</i>

1670
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:31,717
How fast can that thing get us
halfway around the world?

1671
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:35,088
Very. It's a spaceship.

1672
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:55,032
If we're traveling, now's the time.

1673
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:59,446
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.

1674
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,748
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

1675
01:51:17,045 --> 01:51:18,547
She's a keeper.

1676
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:20,473
Must take after her mom.

1677
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,262
I can't argue with that, kid.

1678
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,519
Move! We're retrieving the Seed,

1679
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,694
but then we're done
defending the humans.

1680
01:51:31,768 --> 01:51:34,237
What, done?
What do you mean, you're done?

1681
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:37,487
Means "finished,"
"see ya," "good-bye."

1682
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:55,759
Hijacked part of my ship?
How did you let this happen?

1683
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:59,054
Shut down dark-matter drive,
reverse course at light speed,

1684
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:00,551
and get us back!

1685
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:03,634
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1686
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:06,603
And he will feel my wrath!

1687
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:15,529
Welcome to China.

1688
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:18,691
Put Galvatron in containment.
Tell the techs do not activate him.

1689
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:19,821
Absolutely, sir.

1690
01:52:20,108 --> 01:52:21,985
<i>I WANT SECURITY ON HIGH ALERT.</i>

1691
01:52:25,072 --> 01:52:26,415
Joyce.

1692
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:30,828
I cannot tell you
how enthused I am to deliver this.

1693
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,716
Top of your alien wish list.

1694
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:39,087
It's yours. Or rather ours.

1695
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,469
I will need to see my advance.

1696
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:46,476
Five million shares
of the company.

1697
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,144
Together,
we're gonna end human warfare.

1698
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:51,432
<i>We're about to build
a fully automated U.S. Army.</i>

1699
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:54,359
<i>Just think of all the American lives
we're gonna save.</i>

1700
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:08,825
<i>ALL OF THESE CARS ARE KSI's
NEWEST CIVILIAN PROTOTYPE ROBOTS.</i>

1701
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:11,585
So how soon until
we can start continuous production?

1702
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:27,392
You know, why don't we take
a beat on this for a minute?

1703
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,850
I have some new data
that I discovered and...

1704
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,055
You're not backing out on me here?

1705
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:33,769
No, I'm not backing out. I just...

1706
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:36,144
I want the Seed.
I'm not saying I don't want the Seed.

1707
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:38,399
I'm just saying I don't know if I...

1708
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,572
if I want the Seed right now.

1709
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:44,242
Good men have died
trying to get that thing for us.

1710
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:45,406
For you.

1711
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,996
I know what you did to get that thing.

1712
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,039
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1713
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:53,251
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops.
Don't you threaten me.

1714
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,372
I started this company when I was a boy,

1715
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:59,129
with a dream
of making the world a better place.

1716
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:01,881
Funny. I had the same dream.

1717
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:06,056
Somewhere along the way,
you made billions of dollars.

1718
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:08,425
So why don't you tell me
what's missing from my dream?

1719
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:11,102
Why don't you tell me what's missing
from my boyhood dream?

1720
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:17,101
I have served my country for decades
of unparalleled prosperity

1721
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:19,983
and you are my golden parachute.

1722
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:23,823
So you are damn well
jumping out of the plane with me!

1723
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:37,545
I am Galvatron!

1724
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,213
- What's going on?
- Your Galvatron has gone active.

1725
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,099
What haven't you been telling me?

1726
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:52,144
Find Darcy, and bring a car around
downstairs. Quietly.

1727
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:55,668
We got a factory emergency.
I have to get you out of here.

1728
01:54:55,972 --> 01:54:57,852
- What the hell's going on?
- Take them outside.

1729
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,148
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

1730
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:02,650
I got what "it" wanted.

1731
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:08,653
My brothers,
today I grant you your freedom.

1732
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:13,833
And from now on,
you are commanded by me.

1733
01:55:14,783 --> 01:55:16,126
Rise up!

1734
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:20,334
Go find my Seed!

1735
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:38,023
Detonate the Seed in the largest city.

1736
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:41,893
Listen, princess.
I don't wanna hear, "I told you so,"

1737
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:43,737
but this is much more dangerous
than I think.

1738
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,071
Get in.

1739
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,288
Galvatron's hacked into the others.

1740
01:55:53,363 --> 01:55:54,831
- What?
- Joshua.

1741
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,586
- You have to contain this!
- Drive, drive!

1742
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:58,039
Son of a...

1743
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:03,048
Come on.
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

1744
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:20,728
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.

1745
01:56:21,057 --> 01:56:23,560
I know a military garrison there
that will help us.

1746
01:56:24,769 --> 01:56:27,113
Threatening a professional CIA killer.

1747
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:30,863
Possibly not my finest hour.
I'd like to have that one back.

1748
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:33,115
Killer? I thought they were your friends!

1749
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,164
No. Not friends. Business.
They gave me this bomb.

1750
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:38,041
- Bomb?
- Oh!

1751
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:39,493
Is there a bomb in the bag?

1752
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,670
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

1753
01:56:41,745 --> 01:56:42,837
Shit.

1754
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:55,008
<i>When you said you were done
fighting for humans,</i>

1755
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,219
you didn't mean that, did you?

1756
01:56:57,302 --> 01:57:00,681
How many more of my kind
must be sacrificed

1757
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:03,108
to atone for your mistakes?

1758
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:04,525
Well, what do you think
being human means?

1759
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:05,693
That's what we do.

1760
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:07,730
We make mistakes.

1761
01:57:08,605 --> 01:57:11,484
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.

1762
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:19,912
When I fixed you, it was for a reward.

1763
01:57:20,242 --> 01:57:23,462
That was it. That was why. For money.

1764
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:26,840
And it was me making a mistake.

1765
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:29,835
Without it, you wouldn't be here.

1766
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:36,304
So even if you got no faith in us,
I'm asking you to do what I do.

1767
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:39,265
I'm asking you to look at all the junk
and see the treasure.

1768
01:57:40,262 --> 01:57:44,267
You gotta have faith, Prime,
in who we can be.

1769
01:57:56,194 --> 01:57:58,572
I'm seriously pissed
we're not getting paid for this.

1770
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:01,875
Well, at least we get to kill him.

1771
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:04,941
They're not getting away if
I still got him on satellite.

1772
01:58:05,662 --> 01:58:08,336
Some genius.
Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

1773
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:11,292
<i>- Joshua'?
- Yes'?</i>

1774
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:13,173
How lethal is that bomb?

1775
01:58:13,878 --> 01:58:15,346
Uh, I don't know. Let me check.

1776
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:23,338
I love this! This is so good.

1777
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:24,514
Oh, hang on.

1778
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:28,401
I'm getting a text from
ll Duce in Hong Kong.

1779
01:58:28,852 --> 01:58:31,230
"Need to know
the Seed's estimated blast range."

1780
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:32,656
Duh.

1781
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:45,039
I'll do the diversion!
Get that thing somewhere safe!

1782
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:52,505
Killers are coming! Guys, we gotta go!

1783
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,090
Guys, guys...

1784
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:55,754
- Shut up! Shut up!
- All right! I'm sorry!

1785
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,079
All right, go ahead, go ahead!

1786
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:02,560
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait!

1787
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:06,352
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.

1788
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:08,933
I need a raise! I want a raise.

1789
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,697
All right, yes!
I'm sure whatever you want!

1790
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:15,820
Go, go, go!

1791
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:19,069
Oh, no!

1792
01:59:21,946 --> 01:59:23,666
Death is on our tail! Death is on our tail!

1793
01:59:30,955 --> 01:59:33,754
Get out of the way, all of you!
Get out of the way!

1794
01:59:35,877 --> 01:59:37,675
I don't want to die like this.

1795
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:54,771
Box them in.

1796
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:09,790
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

1797
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:11,951
Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere.
You're amazing!

1798
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:13,669
We're going to get you to the roof.

1799
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:14,749
Good, good.

1800
02:00:20,714 --> 02:00:21,806
Go!

1801
02:00:32,434 --> 02:00:34,107
LOL. That's funny.

1802
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:36,525
I can't... This is really happening.

1803
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:40,818
A man, me, who is worth
over 20 billion dollars is now

1804
02:00:41,317 --> 02:00:44,821
being chased by CIA assassins.
That's the truth.

1805
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:48,037
And in the middle
of a robot uprising.

1806
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:53,792
And I'm carrying what is,
in essence, a tactical nuke.

1807
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:57,421
And the great thing is I...
The great thing is that I'm...

1808
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,047
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

1809
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:00,674
- Just stop it!
- What?

1810
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:02,804
You need to hide on the roof
of this building.

1811
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:04,594
I'll get you a helicopter extraction.

1812
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,727
Okay.

1813
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:13,024
I like her.

1814
02:01:13,725 --> 02:01:14,805
I find her very attractive.

1815
02:01:16,895 --> 02:01:18,738
He's definitely around here.

1816
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:20,356
Come on, come on.

1817
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,319
I got a bike!

1818
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:26,321
Check in there!

1819
02:01:26,821 --> 02:01:28,823
These are the CIA assassins
I told you about.

1820
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:32,376
Whoa!

1821
02:01:32,911 --> 02:01:34,458
- Guys.
- Let's go.

1822
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:36,748
Hello.

1823
02:01:43,463 --> 02:01:44,885
Hey! Okay-

1824
02:01:51,930 --> 02:01:53,370
- Pick it up.
- All right. I'm gonna.

1825
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:08,450
Wow.

1826
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:13,161
Wow. Wow, thank you.
Wow! How did you...

1827
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,670
Police training, prior to my MBA.

1828
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:17,630
I love you.

1829
02:02:19,082 --> 02:02:20,208
Get to the roof.

1830
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:21,501
All right, okay.

1831
02:02:52,407 --> 02:02:53,533
Mmm!

1832
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:19,105
Find my Seed. It's here!

1833
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,820
Those prototypes are after that bomb.

1834
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,367
No!

1835
02:03:32,196 --> 02:03:34,039
No, no, no, no!

1836
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:39,291
Who the hell's aboard that?

1837
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,164
Impossible.

1838
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:53,389
Brothers, it's the Autobots!
Shoot them down!

1839
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,895
Joshua!

1840
02:03:59,974 --> 02:04:01,066
Hey, Baldy!

1841
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:02,731
Hey, it's me! Hey!

1842
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,097
Bring it over now! Let's go.

1843
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:06,735
Hurry up, run!

1844
02:04:07,106 --> 02:04:09,029
- Hurry! Come on!
- Let's go! Move it!

1845
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:11,531
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now!

1846
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:13,822
Looks like
we might have company.

1847
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,667
We're hit! We're hit!

1848
02:04:51,651 --> 02:04:54,495
They live, they talk, we're dead.

1849
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,240
- Kill them all.
- Pleasure.

1850
02:04:59,659 --> 02:05:01,753
I count ten below!

1851
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:05,032
I thought you said
you had one prototype get infected.

1852
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:07,250
Now he's got operational control
of my other 50.

1853
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:08,509
Come on.

1854
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,430
Climb, climb!

1855
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:14,841
Surround them.

1856
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:22,353
I may have started the apocalypse,
but you brought your family.

1857
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:24,184
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.

1858
02:05:24,642 --> 02:05:26,189
Oh, I'm about one second away
from knocking you out,

1859
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:27,566
taking the bomb,
and just leaving you here.

1860
02:05:27,645 --> 02:05:29,067
Please, do me a favor.

1861
02:05:29,522 --> 02:05:32,025
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

1862
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:33,428
- Come on, bitch!
- Come on!

1863
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:46,964
<i>Evac! Evac!</i>

1864
02:05:47,123 --> 02:05:48,545
We're getting flanked!

1865
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:51,631
We got company below!

1866
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:54,426
Oh!

1867
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:58,602
My fat ass is stuck!
Bee, take the shot!

1868
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:05,896
Oh!

1869
02:06:08,936 --> 02:06:10,483
- Into the elevator! Get in.
- Okay.

1870
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:11,610
Come on.

1871
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:16,406
Get down, get down!

1872
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:19,111
Close the door! Close the door!

1873
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:22,951
Won't go! It's not closing!

1874
02:06:23,159 --> 02:06:24,456
There's too much weight.

1875
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:26,333
- Get back down to Bumblebee!
- Dad, no!

1876
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,919
Hey! You want me!

1877
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:40,426
Center elevator.

1878
02:06:40,676 --> 02:06:42,019
<i>Center elevator.</i>

1879
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:47,942
He's gonna be okay.

1880
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:03,541
Alien bomb! Alien bomb,
coming through!

1881
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:05,709
Clear the way! Clear the... Hi, kids.

1882
02:07:05,785 --> 02:07:07,332
Coming through, ladies!

1883
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:09,756
Excuse me!
Excuse me, ladies! Excuse me!

1884
02:07:09,914 --> 02:07:10,915
Oh, my God!

1885
02:07:11,082 --> 02:07:13,322
How do you say, "Get the fuck
out of the way" in Chinese?

1886
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:45,165
Ahhh!

1887
02:07:57,962 --> 02:08:00,306
That's a long way down.

1888
02:08:03,259 --> 02:08:04,476
You've got to be kidding me.

1889
02:08:06,554 --> 02:08:07,806
No!

1890
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:21,576
Come on.

1891
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:30,790
Whoa!

1892
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:35,007
I'm coming for you!

1893
02:09:10,284 --> 02:09:12,002
Never should have hidden that truck.

1894
02:09:12,328 --> 02:09:14,080
You should have never
came after my family.

1895
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:17,007
Tough luck, Yeager. We all have family.

1896
02:09:17,792 --> 02:09:19,339
Yeah, but I'm gonna live to see mine.

1897
02:09:43,025 --> 02:09:45,824
<i>Where is my escaped bounty?</i>

1898
02:09:45,903 --> 02:09:47,701
Autobots at this location.

1899
02:09:48,364 --> 02:09:50,037
Prime is close.

1900
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,419
Do whatever you have to do.

1901
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,372
I intend to.

1902
02:09:58,916 --> 02:10:00,543
- Darcy!
- Joshua!

1903
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:01,798
We got three more
coming in from that way!

1904
02:10:02,044 --> 02:10:03,671
Bee, where's Tessa?

1905
02:10:04,714 --> 02:10:05,715
Dad!

1906
02:10:08,634 --> 02:10:11,854
We got a real dilemma here. Okay?
I created incredible robots.

1907
02:10:11,929 --> 02:10:14,478
It's all designed
to kick that fat Transformer's ass.

1908
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:17,310
So, really, this is a no-win situation.

1909
02:10:17,393 --> 02:10:18,645
It's over.

1910
02:10:18,728 --> 02:10:19,729
That was mean.

1911
02:10:19,937 --> 02:10:23,237
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't handle
the cold-hearted truth!

1912
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:26,118
<i>Optimus, what are my orders
with these humans?</i>

1913
02:10:26,193 --> 02:10:27,536
<i>Can I squish the bald guy?</i>

1914
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,033
They're in trouble.

1915
02:10:29,113 --> 02:10:30,911
Nah! This isn't our fight!

1916
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:33,789
I'm done being an underdog.
Underdogs suck!

1917
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,711
I say they get what they deserve.

1918
02:10:35,786 --> 02:10:37,254
What's the play, Prime?

1919
02:10:37,455 --> 02:10:40,334
It's time for reinforcements.

1920
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:45,842
Recognize one of your Knights.

1921
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:08,949
THE LEGEND EXISTS.

1922
02:11:16,202 --> 02:11:17,579
Come on.

1923
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:20,873
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!

1924
02:11:21,123 --> 02:11:22,295
Bee, go!

1925
02:11:26,796 --> 02:11:28,969
Come on, we got to move!
Let's go, move!

1926
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:35,187
Where's Tessa?
Tessa, get over here! Come on.

1927
02:11:35,262 --> 02:11:36,559
Get over here!

1928
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:39,146
Stay behind me!
I'm covering you!

1929
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:41,603
If I stop covering you, it means I'm dead.

1930
02:11:41,685 --> 02:11:42,937
But that ain't gonna happen.

1931
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:45,614
Take that!

1932
02:11:47,817 --> 02:11:50,320
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

1933
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:52,071
Goddamn!

1934
02:11:52,405 --> 02:11:53,577
Come on! We gotta move now!

1935
02:11:55,157 --> 02:11:56,249
Go, go!

1936
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:04,629
We got hostiles coming down the street!

1937
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:07,336
Go!

1938
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,176
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

1939
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:19,936
We're surrounded!

1940
02:12:20,015 --> 02:12:21,141
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

1941
02:12:21,642 --> 02:12:22,689
Rocket!

1942
02:12:23,519 --> 02:12:24,566
Go, go, go!

1943
02:12:24,728 --> 02:12:25,854
Get down!

1944
02:12:28,858 --> 02:12:30,451
Oh, this is the perfect place to hide.

1945
02:12:30,526 --> 02:12:34,247
A big glass box! Nobody will ever
find us here! That's...

1946
02:12:37,074 --> 02:12:39,247
You've got to be kidding me.

1947
02:12:39,869 --> 02:12:44,045
Legendary warriors,
the powers that created us

1948
02:12:44,123 --> 02:12:46,876
now want us all extinguished.

1949
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:51,260
We must join forces,
or else forever be their slaves.

1950
02:12:52,798 --> 02:12:55,893
So today you stand with us...

1951
02:12:56,093 --> 02:12:59,893
...or you stand against me.

1952
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:08,739
We'll let Prime figure this one out.

1953
02:13:08,814 --> 02:13:10,031
Very wise.

1954
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:12,694
There's no friggin' way
I'm staying down here with them.

1955
02:13:12,776 --> 02:13:14,028
No way. No way.

1956
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:23,296
Only together can we survive!

1957
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,090
Let me lead you!

1958
02:13:38,093 --> 02:13:39,345
Oh, no.

1959
02:13:39,428 --> 02:13:41,681
I was expecting a giant car.

1960
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:43,274
Come here!

1961
02:13:49,438 --> 02:13:51,736
We're giving you freedom.

1962
02:14:07,957 --> 02:14:10,676
You defend my family,

1963
02:14:12,628 --> 02:14:14,380
or die.

1964
02:14:17,383 --> 02:14:18,976
Autobots,

1965
02:14:19,176 --> 02:14:23,807
we're going to prove who we are
and why we're here!

1966
02:14:25,015 --> 02:14:27,393
Ugh, you just want to die for the guy.

1967
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:30,650
That's leadership.
Or brainwashing, or something.

1968
02:14:30,729 --> 02:14:34,484
No. That's Optimus Prime.

1969
02:14:40,573 --> 02:14:43,326
Autobots, we charge together!

1970
02:14:44,868 --> 02:14:46,415
Now, roll out!

1971
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:51,376
We're getting boxed in!
We're getting flanked everywhere!

1972
02:14:51,834 --> 02:14:53,131
Help me out here!

1973
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:54,302
Kill anything that moves!

1974
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,298
Come on, Cade, shoot!

1975
02:14:59,008 --> 02:15:00,635
Come and get some, you little bitch!

1976
02:15:00,718 --> 02:15:02,061
Incoming!

1977
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,351
I can't believe
I'm putting my life in your hands.

1978
02:15:08,559 --> 02:15:09,839
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

1979
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:10,936
- Go ahead, take it.
- No, I don't want the gun.

1980
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,021
- Come on, you can lead.
- No, I don't want the gun.

1981
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:13,564
Then stay under there and shut up!

1982
02:15:13,772 --> 02:15:16,070
All right. You're good with the gun.
So you keep it.

1983
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:22,532
Running out of guns and ammo.

1984
02:15:22,615 --> 02:15:23,616
Ow!

1985
02:15:30,623 --> 02:15:33,297
Come and get some!

1986
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:36,261
You're all gonna die!

1987
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:58,442
Way to go, baby!

1988
02:15:59,485 --> 02:16:00,907
Good shooting, Cade!

1989
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:08,461
I'm like a fat ballerina
who takes scalps and slits throats!

1990
02:16:15,584 --> 02:16:17,177
Got your fortune cookie!

1991
02:16:18,879 --> 02:16:20,301
Come here, you little punk.

1992
02:16:23,759 --> 02:16:26,933
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here!

1993
02:16:27,221 --> 02:16:28,222
Here! Take it. Take it!

1994
02:16:28,305 --> 02:16:30,105
Little help! Little help!

1995
02:16:30,474 --> 02:16:31,976
It's live! It's live, it's live. Take it!

1996
02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:33,026
What do you want me to do with it?

1997
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:34,945
- Just throw it!
- Give, give, give!

1998
02:16:49,076 --> 02:16:50,623
Got some bad news, Cade.

1999
02:16:50,994 --> 02:16:53,622
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas.

2000
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:05,100
Faster! Go!

2001
02:17:12,599 --> 02:17:13,976
I'll kill you!

2002
02:17:43,338 --> 02:17:45,011
Charge!

2003
02:17:56,185 --> 02:17:58,779
No, impossible!

2004
02:17:58,854 --> 02:18:01,152
They're ruining everything!

2005
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:03,192
Take that!

2006
02:18:10,866 --> 02:18:12,038
Get off me.

2007
02:18:13,702 --> 02:18:15,454
- Get up, Hound!
- I can't go on.

2008
02:18:15,537 --> 02:18:17,130
But you gotta keep fighting!

2009
02:18:17,206 --> 02:18:18,708
Tank's empty, bro.

2010
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:20,963
There's more of 'em coming.
If you don't get up

2011
02:18:21,043 --> 02:18:22,643
and fight, we're going to die. Let's go!

2012
02:18:27,716 --> 02:18:29,218
Attack!

2013
02:18:33,263 --> 02:18:34,936
Optimus is here!

2014
02:18:46,068 --> 02:18:47,741
Bee, jump!

2015
02:19:36,743 --> 02:19:37,960
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

2016
02:20:08,275 --> 02:20:10,152
<i>I hate cheap knockoffs.</i>

2017
02:20:12,321 --> 02:20:13,413
Awesome job!

2018
02:20:13,488 --> 02:20:15,365
- You.
- Who?

2019
02:20:15,449 --> 02:20:16,917
- You.
- Step forward.

2020
02:20:17,117 --> 02:20:18,118
Wait. Why?

2021
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:22,547
Your science will be responsible
for humanity's extinction.

2022
02:20:22,748 --> 02:20:27,800
All right. I know that you're sensitive
to this whole bioethical dilemma.

2023
02:20:28,003 --> 02:20:29,050
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is

2024
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:30,506
that some things
should never be invented.

2025
02:20:30,672 --> 02:20:32,140
Ahhh!

2026
02:20:35,344 --> 02:20:36,436
Okay.

2027
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:38,517
We'll lead you out of the city.

2028
02:20:38,597 --> 02:20:41,692
Get that Seed safely to the hills.

2029
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:43,189
Use this car.

2030
02:20:43,393 --> 02:20:44,690
He almost ate me!

2031
02:20:47,648 --> 02:20:48,991
All right, we're good!

2032
02:20:49,566 --> 02:20:50,567
All right, let's go!

2033
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:53,856
Get out of that seat.

2034
02:20:55,322 --> 02:20:57,165
And you're one lucky dad to have me.

2035
02:20:58,825 --> 02:21:01,544
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that.
You drive. Let's go.

2036
02:21:12,673 --> 02:21:13,720
What did you do?

2037
02:21:13,882 --> 02:21:16,385
I don't know.
I don't know, but it's an issue.

2038
02:21:16,593 --> 02:21:17,810
- Did you press a button?
- Is it gonna blow up?

2039
02:21:17,886 --> 02:21:18,887
I don't know.

2040
02:21:19,054 --> 02:21:21,227
Your thing is beeping now,
so you must have hit something.

2041
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:23,024
- Is it gonna blow up?
- I don't know!

2042
02:21:23,141 --> 02:21:25,314
A bomb starts beeping,
that might signal a problem, you think?

2043
02:21:25,394 --> 02:21:28,068
I'm just saying
that it's a steady blinking light,

2044
02:21:28,146 --> 02:21:29,693
which could be a timer of some kind.

2045
02:21:30,732 --> 02:21:32,700
Unless it's signaling location.

2046
02:21:34,069 --> 02:21:35,241
To who?

2047
02:21:43,161 --> 02:21:45,289
We've got to call the central government
for help!

2048
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:52,839
Optimus Prime.

2049
02:21:54,256 --> 02:21:56,679
Come to me.

2050
02:22:56,485 --> 02:22:57,486
DEFENSE MINISTER...

2051
02:22:57,861 --> 02:22:59,613
...THERE'S A CRISIS IN HONG KONG!

2052
02:23:04,117 --> 02:23:06,477
<i>THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL
PROTECT HONG KONG AT ALL COSTS.</i>

2053
02:23:06,828 --> 02:23:08,501
WE HAVE FIGHTER JETS ON THE WAY.

2054
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:16,171
There's the bridge.

2055
02:23:34,856 --> 02:23:36,073
Back it up! Back it up!

2056
02:23:36,358 --> 02:23:39,908
Go, go, go, go!
Back up! Go back! Go back!

2057
02:23:39,986 --> 02:23:41,466
Move!
Get out of the way. I can't see!

2058
02:23:41,571 --> 02:23:43,573
- Shane, drive faster!
- Okay, just calm down.

2059
02:23:56,044 --> 02:23:57,844
- Shane, watch out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2060
02:24:00,882 --> 02:24:02,600
- Get cover!
- Back up! Back! Back up!

2061
02:24:07,973 --> 02:24:09,725
Autobots, fall back!

2062
02:24:14,187 --> 02:24:15,939
- Come on, move! Out of my way!
- Get out of the way!

2063
02:24:16,022 --> 02:24:17,702
- Look out!
- Just hit them! Just hit them!

2064
02:24:37,669 --> 02:24:38,670
It's a big magnet!

2065
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:40,593
It's sucking up metal and dropping it!

2066
02:24:44,009 --> 02:24:45,226
Oh!

2067
02:24:47,596 --> 02:24:48,597
- Go faster! Go faster!
- Move!

2068
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:50,682
- Get out of the way!
- It's coming! It's coming!

2069
02:24:50,765 --> 02:24:52,267
It's coming closer!

2070
02:24:52,601 --> 02:24:54,148
Go faster, Shane!

2071
02:24:56,438 --> 02:24:57,610
Watch out, watch out!

2072
02:24:58,523 --> 02:25:00,196
- Watch out!
- Look out!

2073
02:25:00,442 --> 02:25:01,443
Whoa!

2074
02:25:04,112 --> 02:25:05,238
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2075
02:25:06,114 --> 02:25:09,584
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us!
Hard right! Take a hard right!

2076
02:25:09,993 --> 02:25:11,119
Move it! Get out of the way!

2077
02:25:11,494 --> 02:25:13,872
Oh, my God!

2078
02:25:28,637 --> 02:25:30,981
Oh, no. No, the magnet. Get out, get out!

2079
02:25:31,306 --> 02:25:33,604
Come on! Come here! Get out!

2080
02:25:35,435 --> 02:25:37,312
No, no, no!
No, we're going up. Grab the bomb!

2081
02:25:37,395 --> 02:25:38,738
Help me grab the bomb!

2082
02:25:38,813 --> 02:25:40,013
I can't get the seat belt off!

2083
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,658
Pull me down! Catch me!

2084
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:43,318
I'm going up! I'm going up!

2085
02:25:43,485 --> 02:25:44,907
Get me! Grab me!

2086
02:25:46,655 --> 02:25:48,328
Pull me down! Pull me!

2087
02:25:48,406 --> 02:25:49,749
I can't get the seat belt off!

2088
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,417
I can't get the belt off!

2089
02:25:52,494 --> 02:25:53,996
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

2090
02:25:55,163 --> 02:25:56,643
Hold the bomb! I can't hold on!

2091
02:25:57,791 --> 02:25:58,792
Pull!

2092
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,468
Guys, it's crushing me!

2093
02:26:12,514 --> 02:26:13,766
Car!

2094
02:26:14,182 --> 02:26:15,308
Move!

2095
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:20,146
Shane!

2096
02:26:20,522 --> 02:26:22,274
- Shane!
- I'm good! I'm good.

2097
02:26:22,774 --> 02:26:23,854
I'm good.

2098
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:30,907
Bumblebee!

2099
02:26:34,077 --> 02:26:35,545
<i>Hey, you guys!</i>

2100
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:37,376
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

2101
02:26:37,539 --> 02:26:38,540
Come on.

2102
02:26:40,041 --> 02:26:41,213
Go find someplace safe.

2103
02:26:41,584 --> 02:26:42,881
I'm proud of you.

2104
02:26:57,267 --> 02:26:58,359
Get cover!

2105
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:04,782
Cade!

2106
02:27:06,067 --> 02:27:10,368
Autobots, get this bomb over the bridge
and out of the city!

2107
02:27:10,447 --> 02:27:11,494
Dad!

2108
02:27:12,157 --> 02:27:13,625
What? Come on.

2109
02:28:10,298 --> 02:28:12,517
I got it!
I'm getting this bomb out of here!

2110
02:28:12,675 --> 02:28:13,847
Give me the gun.

2111
02:28:14,886 --> 02:28:16,980
It's you and me now!

2112
02:28:23,186 --> 02:28:24,278
Look, Optimus is out there all alone.

2113
02:28:24,354 --> 02:28:25,606
What? You can't help him.

2114
02:28:25,772 --> 02:28:27,252
I have to, Tess. He came back for us.

2115
02:28:27,315 --> 02:28:28,407
Dad, don't leave, please.

2116
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:30,152
Look, I'll find you, I'll get there, okay?

2117
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:31,570
Dad, no, you'll die!

2118
02:28:31,653 --> 02:28:33,533
You gotta stay with Shane.
You're gonna be okay.

2119
02:28:33,613 --> 02:28:34,705
You promise me
you're gonna keep her safe,

2120
02:28:34,781 --> 02:28:37,000
rest of her life, until the end of time!
Promise me!

2121
02:28:37,158 --> 02:28:38,535
I promise you.

2122
02:28:38,993 --> 02:28:40,415
You're the best thing I ever made, Tess.

2123
02:28:40,495 --> 02:28:42,495
All right, don't ever forget it,
it was always you.

2124
02:28:42,539 --> 02:28:44,007
- I love you.
- Please.

2125
02:28:44,582 --> 02:28:45,879
Get in the car, now.

2126
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:47,256
Dad!

2127
02:28:56,886 --> 02:28:58,729
Prime!

2128
02:29:24,914 --> 02:29:26,474
Stop the car!

2129
02:29:27,292 --> 02:29:29,215
- You better <i>listen.</i>
- No, you listen.

2130
02:29:30,545 --> 02:29:32,422
I'm not leaving my dad.

2131
02:29:44,225 --> 02:29:47,900
All right, we're gonna
hold the line, then block the bridge!

2132
02:30:16,674 --> 02:30:18,847
You see, it takes patience
to make a man.

2133
02:30:18,927 --> 02:30:22,397
The patience to watch and wait,
to protect all of us, quietly,

2134
02:30:22,472 --> 02:30:25,271
for God and country,
without any recognition at all!

2135
02:30:30,605 --> 02:30:31,606
Cade!

2136
02:30:32,023 --> 02:30:36,028
There are no good aliens!
Or bad aliens, Yeager.

2137
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:38,659
It's just us and them.

2138
02:30:38,738 --> 02:30:40,115
And you chose them.

2139
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:47,539
Anytime.

2140
02:30:58,967 --> 02:31:02,346
You saved the human
instead of saving yourself?

2141
02:31:02,428 --> 02:31:04,647
You bring shame upon us all.

2142
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:22,165
She never listens. Never.

2143
02:31:25,326 --> 02:31:27,499
I gave you an order!

2144
02:31:41,259 --> 02:31:43,011
Get out of here, now!

2145
02:31:43,094 --> 02:31:44,095
Get in. Get in.

2146
02:31:44,679 --> 02:31:46,852
Hey, you! Hey!

2147
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:53,026
Cade, get out of here! This is my fight!

2148
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:59,866
It's my fight, and you're all gonna die!

2149
02:32:08,953 --> 02:32:10,546
Go! Go!

2150
02:32:11,205 --> 02:32:12,206
Come on! Come on!

2151
02:32:18,713 --> 02:32:20,386
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!

2152
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,142
Whoo!

2153
02:32:38,608 --> 02:32:39,655
Come on.

2154
02:32:47,825 --> 02:32:49,168
Get away, all of you!

2155
02:32:50,536 --> 02:32:52,413
Come on, Tess.
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess.

2156
02:33:00,421 --> 02:33:01,422
Drive!

2157
02:33:04,342 --> 02:33:06,765
- You see my face, your life is done!
- Oh!

2158
02:33:06,969 --> 02:33:08,009
Come on, come OH, come on!

2159
02:33:24,612 --> 02:33:25,613
Yeah!

2160
02:33:27,532 --> 02:33:29,876
Honor to the end.

2161
02:33:31,703 --> 02:33:32,955
You still happy we met?

2162
02:33:38,292 --> 02:33:39,293
Always.

2163
02:33:46,843 --> 02:33:47,844
Hurry!

2164
02:33:49,303 --> 02:33:51,806
Quickly! I'm setting off
Lockdown's grenade!

2165
02:33:51,889 --> 02:33:52,890
Hold tight!

2166
02:34:09,574 --> 02:34:15,172
We shall meet again, Prime,
for I am reborn.

2167
02:34:30,845 --> 02:34:32,847
Kind of nice being your hero
for a change.

2168
02:34:34,182 --> 02:34:36,685
You always were. All my life.

2169
02:34:38,186 --> 02:34:39,187
I love you.

2170
02:34:40,396 --> 02:34:41,568
I love you, too.

2171
02:34:42,857 --> 02:34:44,234
Let's go home to graduation, huh?

2172
02:34:45,401 --> 02:34:46,402
Yeah.

2173
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,530
You're okay, kid.

2174
02:34:48,696 --> 02:34:51,415
Come here, you're all right.
You're all right.

2175
02:34:55,036 --> 02:34:56,959
We don't have a home, Dad.

2176
02:34:57,038 --> 02:34:58,255
It blew up.

2177
02:35:02,877 --> 02:35:04,971
I might be able to help you with that.

2178
02:35:10,927 --> 02:35:12,304
Brave warriors...

2179
02:35:13,471 --> 02:35:15,064
...you are free!

2180
02:35:16,474 --> 02:35:18,897
I'll ride
with you anytime, Spike!

2181
02:35:38,329 --> 02:35:39,831
Did you miss me?

2182
02:35:40,581 --> 02:35:41,753
No.

2183
02:35:43,835 --> 02:35:48,591
This Seed belongs to our creators,
whoever they are.

2184
02:35:49,173 --> 02:35:51,551
There remains a price on my head.

2185
02:35:52,468 --> 02:35:55,312
I endanger you all if I stay.

2186
02:35:56,639 --> 02:35:59,984
I shall take it
where it can never be found.

2187
02:36:01,561 --> 02:36:03,154
Will we ever see you again?

2188
02:36:03,396 --> 02:36:04,693
Cade Yeager,

2189
02:36:04,939 --> 02:36:06,941
I do not know.

2190
02:36:07,441 --> 02:36:10,115
But whenever you look to the stars,

2191
02:36:10,778 --> 02:36:12,997
think of one of them

2192
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:15,788
<i>as</i> my soul.

2193
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:20,003
Defend this family, Autobots,

2194
02:36:21,497 --> 02:36:23,670
as they have you.

2195
02:36:24,709 --> 02:36:26,632
Defend

2196
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:29,389
all they can be.

2197
02:36:36,721 --> 02:36:39,019
<i>There are
mysteries to the universe</i>

2198
02:36:39,098 --> 02:36:41,521
we were never meant to solve.

2199
02:36:42,685 --> 02:36:46,690
<i>But who we are and why we are here</i>

2200
02:36:47,565 --> 02:36:49,567
<i>are not among them.</i>

2201
02:36:50,192 --> 02:36:54,242
<i>Those answers we carry inside.</i>

2202
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:57,746
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

2203
02:36:57,825 --> 02:37:01,250
<i>and this message is to my creators:</i>

2204
02:37:01,329 --> 02:37:04,173
<i>Leave planet Earth alone.</i>

2205
02:37:05,041 --> 02:37:07,009
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

2206
02:37:07,084 --> 02:37:08,552
<i>for you.</i>
