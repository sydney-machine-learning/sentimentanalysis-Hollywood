You hear me?

736
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:14,705
All right, Johnnie,

737
01:22:14,772 --> 01:22:16,340
I'll see you
in a little while, all right?

738
01:22:16,407 --> 01:22:17,675
I'm going to work.

739
01:22:18,576 --> 01:22:20,778
[soft instrumental music

740
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,444

[Monica speaking]

744
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:39,318
[in English] Mom wants to
go back to California

745
01:24:39,384 --> 01:24:40,751
because of Grandma.

746
01:24:42,054 --> 01:24:43,055
When?

747
01:24:44,655 --> 01:24:48,592
First, they're going to check your
heart, and then decide.

748
01:24:50,695 --> 01:24:53,231
Would you rather live
with Mom or Dad?

749
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:55,901
I don't know.

750
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,036
Me neither.

751
01:25:07,678 --> 01:25:09,547
[Monica] David. David.

752
01:25:10,949 --> 01:25:11,749
Paul.

753
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:14,485
Oh. Thank you so much.

- [Paul] Hmm.
- [in English] Oh, sorry.

756
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:49,488
But don't put that kimchi too far away.
I like it. [chuckles]

757
01:25:49,553 --> 01:25:50,922
[Monica] Oh!

758
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:53,691
- It made me sweat on my head.
- [both laugh]

759
01:25:53,758 --> 01:25:55,559
- You know?
- You okay?

760
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:56,827
I'm good.

761
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,569
[Monica]
You're our first guest here.

762
01:26:05,636 --> 01:26:07,039
[Paul] I'm honored.

763
01:26:13,345 --> 01:26:14,446
Hmm.

764
01:26:14,513 --> 01:26:16,114
[exhales]

765
01:26:31,163 --> 01:26:32,164
Hmm.

766
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:36,134
[breathing sharply]

767
01:26:45,143 --> 01:26:47,913
I'm gonna
put some oil in here.

768
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:50,282
[speaking in tongues]

769
01:26:50,348 --> 01:26:53,617
Paul, she sees something here.

770
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:55,120
- Right here?
- Yeah, yeah.

771
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:58,823
Look out.

772
01:26:59,657 --> 01:27:01,259
Look out, it's gonna...

773
01:27:03,428 --> 01:27:05,297
[shooing]

774
01:27:05,363 --> 01:27:06,898
Cast you out!

775
01:27:07,832 --> 01:27:11,836
Cast you out!
Cast you out!

776
01:27:11,903 --> 01:27:15,140
Hear our prayer,
oh, Heavenly Father.

777
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:19,344
Hear this prayer. Come down,
Jesus, to me, oh, Lord.

778
01:27:19,411 --> 01:27:23,482
Only you can heal.
Only you can heal her.

779
01:27:23,548 --> 01:27:26,251
[continues praying
indistinctly]

780
01:27:26,318 --> 01:27:28,752
It feels different,
doesn't it?

781
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:30,355
[Monica] Mmm, yeah.

782
01:27:30,422 --> 01:27:33,125
- [Paul] It feels like, lighter.
- [Monica chuckles] Yes, yes.

783
01:27:33,191 --> 01:27:34,960
- [Paul] I feel light.
- [Monica] Ah!

784
01:27:35,026 --> 01:27:37,963
Thank you. Thank you, Paul.
Thank you so much.

785
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:41,099
- [Paul] Thank you.
- [Monica] Uh, wait here.

786
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,834
- I have something here. Yeah.
- [Paul] Okay.

787
01:27:51,543 --> 01:27:52,743
Hey.

788
01:27:56,915 --> 01:27:59,985
Do you...
Do you want me to...

789
01:28:00,718 --> 01:28:03,155
To pray for you and...

790
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:05,390
If you want.

791
01:28:08,994 --> 01:28:10,061
Why?

792
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:12,397
No need.

793
01:28:15,267 --> 01:28:16,401
I meant...

794
01:28:16,468 --> 01:28:19,137
Come early tomorrow, okay?
Lot of work.

795
01:28:22,873 --> 01:28:24,943
[speaking Korean]

796
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:45,130
[Jacob scoffs]

797
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,400

[utensils clanging]

800
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,148
[whispering]

801
01:29:16,294 --> 01:29:18,230
[in English]
<i>108 degrees today,</i>

802
01:29:18,296 --> 01:29:20,398
<i>which beats the record
all to smithereens.</i>

803
01:29:20,465 --> 01:29:23,335
<i>It was 101 set way on back
in the 50s.</i>

804
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:25,971
<i>Let's take a look right now
at the full heat wave.</i>

805
01:29:26,037 --> 01:29:28,540
<i>There it is,
17 days' worth. And...</i>

806

[speaking Korean]

807
01:29:34,379 --> 01:29:36,881
- [clattering]
- [Monica exclaims]

808
01:29:42,621 --> 01:29:43,888
[Soonja] Mmm-hmm.

809
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,492
[Soonja speaking]

810
01:29:56,568 --> 01:29:58,136
[Soonja] Hmm.

811
01:29:58,737 --> 01:30:01,006
[Paul mumbling]

812
01:30:01,072 --> 01:30:03,908
[Paul, in English]
You're good. This one's good.

813
01:30:04,976 --> 01:30:06,877
- This one's good.
- [Jacob] Okay.

814
01:30:06,945 --> 01:30:08,246
[Paul] They're all good.

815
01:30:09,881 --> 01:30:11,182
Wait, wait, wait.

816
01:30:11,249 --> 01:30:13,851
[laughing]
Okay, just one more thing.

817
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:15,887
[clears throat]

818
01:30:17,122 --> 01:30:18,423
It's good. What do you think

819
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,823
they're gonna say
when they see that?

820
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:24,696
Jacob.

821
01:30:24,763 --> 01:30:27,065
This good.
Okay, this good.

822
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:31,503
It's good. Yes.
[exhales deeply]

823
01:30:31,569 --> 01:30:32,570
Hey.

824
01:30:34,005 --> 01:30:37,676
They won't say no.
They won't say no.

825
01:30:37,742 --> 01:30:39,744
- [chuckles]
- Okay. Okay.

826
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,179
I love these.

827
01:30:42,846 --> 01:30:46,217
It's a very exciting move.
It's a very important move.

828
01:30:46,284 --> 01:30:47,285
Jacob...

829
01:30:48,153 --> 01:30:50,288
- O... Okay.
- Yes!

830
01:30:50,955 --> 01:30:53,124
[soft music playing]

831
01:31:50,115 --> 01:31:51,449

833
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:01,593
[sighs]

834
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:28,319
[in English] Thank you.

835
01:32:32,023 --> 01:32:33,258
[door closes]

836
01:32:35,727 --> 01:32:36,928
[sighs]

837
01:32:43,201 --> 01:32:44,469
[lab tech] All right.

838
01:32:45,804 --> 01:32:47,338
All right, buddy.

839
01:32:48,306 --> 01:32:49,941
You can sit up,
get dressed,

840
01:32:50,008 --> 01:32:51,743
and go wait in the waiting room.
How's that sound?

841
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:54,779
- Good. Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
01:32:54,846 --> 01:32:56,314
[exclaims softly]

843
01:33:03,923 --> 01:33:05,290
[speaking Korean]

844
01:33:15,066 --> 01:33:16,301
[Anne speaks Korean]

845
01:34:09,654 --> 01:34:10,755
[Jacob sighs]

846
01:35:43,949 --> 01:35:45,216
[door opens]

847
01:35:45,283 --> 01:35:46,751
[Doctor, in English]
Mr. and Mrs. Yi?

848
01:35:46,818 --> 01:35:48,386
Ready to see you now.

849
01:35:49,287 --> 01:35:50,488
[Jacob clears throat]

850
01:35:52,891 --> 01:35:54,425
[Jacob speaking Korean]

851
01:35:56,728 --> 01:35:58,162
[Doctor, in English]
Okay, see,

852
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:59,965
this is where blood flows out,
like a door.

853
01:36:00,032 --> 01:36:02,367
Open, close, open, close.

854
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:04,402
You see how close
the hole is here?

855
01:36:04,469 --> 01:36:06,437
Now this is why the California
doctor wanted to wait

856
01:36:06,504 --> 01:36:09,041
till he's a bit older
before surgery.

857
01:36:09,108 --> 01:36:11,409
But, and are you ready?

858
01:36:11,476 --> 01:36:14,212
It looks like the hole
is getting smaller.

859
01:36:15,647 --> 01:36:18,182
- What?
- It's still there,

860
01:36:18,249 --> 01:36:20,218
but in comparing measurements,

861
01:36:20,284 --> 01:36:22,787
it's a significant
improvement.

862
01:36:22,854 --> 01:36:24,990
All right, this means
we can rule out surgery,

863
01:36:25,057 --> 01:36:27,926
and we can see if the hole
closes up on its own.

864
01:36:30,361 --> 01:36:32,330
This is very good news.

865
01:36:32,397 --> 01:36:35,700
But sound has
gotten louder.

866
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:38,336
[Doctor] Yes. Sometimes,
as the hole gets smaller,

867
01:36:38,403 --> 01:36:40,072
the sound gets louder.

868
01:36:40,139 --> 01:36:41,406
Loud is good.

869
01:36:43,307 --> 01:36:45,144
Are we happy?

870
01:36:45,209 --> 01:36:49,414
Yes, I'm happy.
Thank you.

871
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,449
[Anne speaking Korean]

872
01:36:51,516 --> 01:36:53,484
[Doctor, in English]
Must be the Ozark water.

873
01:36:53,551 --> 01:36:56,621
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't change a thing.

874
01:36:59,657 --> 01:37:00,658
[chuckles]

875

[David, in English]
Hey, what are these?

878
01:37:35,928 --> 01:37:38,262
[Anne] I'm guessing
some kind of...

879
01:37:39,164 --> 01:37:40,832
[speaking Korean]

880
01:37:40,899 --> 01:37:42,600
[David, in English]
Or maybe it's seeds.

881
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:43,902
[Anne] It kind of
looks like peanuts.

882
01:37:43,969 --> 01:37:46,637
- [speaking Korean]
- [Anne speaking]

883
01:37:46,704 --> 01:37:49,273
[in English] Kinda looks like
peanuts chopped in half.

884
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,541
[David] Yeah.

885
01:37:51,476 --> 01:37:53,344
[shop owner speaking Korean]

886
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:20,338
[in English] Okay.
