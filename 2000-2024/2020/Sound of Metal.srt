00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,316
Lulu!

3
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:07,336
Mmm.

4
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:08,921
Lou.

5
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,005
Stop!

6
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,341
- Lou, it's up time.
- Mm-hmm.

7
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:20,224
Up time.

8
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:21,642
- Huh?
- Yeah.

9
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:22,768
Come on.

10
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:27,147
Come on, stop that.

11
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,607
We got to get right to it
for grizzle.

12
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,693
- Remember?
- Okay.

13
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,655
Yo, I got some
smoothie for you.

14
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,157
You're gonna fuckin' hate it.

15
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,366
But it's healthy.

16
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,077
Want some?
I wouldn't recommend it.

17
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:41,996
- It's disgusting.
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:54,258
Okay, poops.

19
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,342
Dance time.

20
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:54,735
Yes!

21
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:13,963
No?
Nah? No?

22
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:14,839

he won't do in that song?

26
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,519
What's left for him to not do?

27
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,687
Anal.

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,610
I used to imagine
Jeff Goldblum was my dad.

30
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,445
Saw him in "The (fucking) Fly",
I was like,

31
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,114
"That must be what
my dad looks like."

32
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,324
Also explains a lot 'cause
the dude's fucking weird.

33
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,659
But he looks like me, man.

34
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:44,869
It's true, yeah.

35
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:45,786
Yeah!

36
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,204
You kinda look
like Jeff Goldblum.

37
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:50,165
Why is it okay to use a
toothpick in public but not floss?

38
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,667
Have you ever tried that?

39
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,459
- To floss my teeth in public? No.
- To floss in public.

40
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,462
Like you're just at the dinner
table, you just pull out some...

41
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:57,173
I used to imagine
my funeral a lot

42
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,258
when I was a kid...
...at school in math.

43
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,801
Fun!

44
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,219
I used to daydream
about my funeral.

45
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,471
Then I'd make myself cry!

46
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:06,724
Uh, yeah, I think
I'd get cremated.

47
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:09,185
- What about you?
- Cremated...

48
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:10,936
or, like, just fed to the birds,
ya know?

49
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:12,605
Well, you know, now you can get

50
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,273
ashes put into

51
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:15,816

54
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,280

- Yeah.

56
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,203
♪ Scary clown face ♪

57
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,337
Yo, we don't need to,
we don't need to put 'em all out.

58
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,756
I know, but we just need
to fill 'em up a little bit.

59
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,049
Okay.

60
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,718
You want to put out
some different ones?

61
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:45,387
Hmm?

62
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:46,680
The face of a sale.

63
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:51,852
Okay, this one costs, uh,
50 bucks extra because...

64
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,647
- It's an original artwork.
- I'm gonna spit on.

65
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,607
Okay, a hundred bucks.

66
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,317
Ten grand.

67
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,110
Did you guys sound check?

68
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,237
No, not yet.

69
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,530
We're going on at...

70
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:04,573
- ...five?
- Did Margaret sound check yet?

71
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,075
Yo, you sound checked yet?

72
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,992
No.

73
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,118
Not looking forward to it.

74
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:09,870
Terrified.

75
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:11,831
Half my shit is broken down.

76
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:02,024
Ah.

77
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:11,367
Ah.

78
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,751
It's... it's probably

79
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,086
a two out of ten

80
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,297
in terms of his hearing.
He can't...

81
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,632
He's having trouble even
communicating with me.

82
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:11,719
It's...

83
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:43,709
I gotta see a doctor?

84
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,378
He...
He can see you now.

85
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,840
- What?
- He can see you right now.

86
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:52,009
- Now?
- Yes, I...

87
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,974
Hey, Lulu.
Uh, sorry I had to run out, baby.

88
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:01,185
I gotta
deal with some shit, okay?

89
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,895
Don't worry about anything,
okay?

90
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:09,902
Mr. Stone?

91
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:13,948
Oh. Oh, yeah.

92
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:18,869
Ah.

93
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,959
<i>Okay, how is that volume?</i>

94
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:26,752
<i>Is the volume loud enough?</i>

95
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,711
<i>Good.</i>

96
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:29,129
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

97
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,089
What?

98
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:31,632
<i>You can hear me okay?</i>

99
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,008
- <i>Volume wise?</i>
- I can hear you.

100
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:35,094
<i>Okay.</i>

101
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,971
<i>I'm gonna say these words.</i>

102
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,807
<i>I want you to repeat them
back to me.</i>

103
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,560
<i>I'm gonna start
with just your right ear.</i>

104
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:43,894
<i>Okay?</i>

105
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:47,106
<i>Bass.</i>

106
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,985
<i>Bass.</i>

107

109
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,992
<i>Car.</i>

110
00:14:58,117 --> 00:14:59,618
Crave.

111
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:00,995
<i>Mop.</i>

112
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,290
Noisy.

113

Search.

114
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,585
Throat.

115
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:08,460
Ditch.

116
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,045
Fish.

117
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,255
Talk.

118
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:12,339
T...

119
00:15:15,593 --> 00:15:17,511
Ring.

Lid.

125
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:44,079
Lid.

126
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:48,667
This is your chart, Ruben.

127
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,794
Now, as far as the volume

128
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,463
that you can hear,

129
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,217
you... on your right ear
were twenty-eight percent,

130
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,301
and on your left ear,

131
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:58,844
you were twenty-four percent.

132
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:00,971
- It's what?
- In the left ear,

133
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,182
- you came in at twenty-four percent.
- Okay.

134
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,350
No matter how...

135
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,602
loud I made the test,

136
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:08,395
I could have put it at eleven,

137
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:09,813
you were still going to miss

138
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:11,982
seventy to eighty percent of the words

139
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,567
that I said.

140
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:14,485
Okay.

141
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:15,778
That is not good.

142
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:17,488
Yeah, I see that.
So what...

143
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:19,949
What can we do about it?

144
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:21,367
How do I get it back?

145
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,743
Well, um...

146
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,830
You have to understand
something here.

147
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:28,582
Whether or not this is related to

148
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,085
your exposure to noise

149
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,629
or it's an autoimmune issue

150
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,714
doesn't really matter.

151
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,842
I understand I got a problem.

152
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,844
I'm asking you what I can do
about it.

153
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,221
Well, what you can do
about it first

154
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,682
is to eliminate all exposure

155
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,934
to loud noises.

156
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,894
And then we can run some tests

157
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,563
and we can determine exactly

158
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:53,148
what is going on with your ears.

159
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,819
And if we do, then we can have
our other conversations.

160
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:58,237
We can have what?

161
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,739
Well...
there are implants

162
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,825
that bypass the cochlea.

163
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:04,702
You said implants?

164
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,328
- Yes.
- Those work?

165
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,873
For people with severe
hearing loss or

166
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:09,874
complete deafness,

167
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,167
yes, they help.

168
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,960
Well, then let's do that.

169
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,503
Well...

170
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,172
it's not that simple.

171
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:17,965
Uh, it's a very involved process

172
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:18,923
and it's quite costly.

173
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,968
How much is it?

174
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,428
Well, they can run between forty

175
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,555
and eighty thousand dollars
depending, and...

176
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,224
they are not covered
by insurance.

177
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,355
Okay.

178
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,690
And, um...

179
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,652
Like, when,
when can you do it?

180
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,321
You got 'em in stock now?

181
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:41,238
Mr. Stone,

182
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,531
your hearing...

183
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,993
is deteriorating rapidly.

184
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,661
Am I right?

185
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:51,165
And over the next few days,

186
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,209
or even hours,

187
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,877
it's going to continue.

188
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:57,880
And the hearing that you have lost

189
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,299
is not coming back.

190
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:03,552
You have to understand

191
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:06,096
your first responsibility

192
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:09,058
is to preserve
the hearing you have.

193
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,304
Ruben, what the fuck?

194
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:02,463
Yes, it'll come back.

195
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:04,256
I have to...

196
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,675
There's like a surgery.

197
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:09,220
What?

198
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:10,888
It's simple.
It's all it is.

199
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,015
There's an implant.
They put it in your shit.

200
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,558
It's like a...

201
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:16,644
Okay, it'll come back.

202
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:18,395
It's fine, Lou.

203
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,105
It's like forty grand,
eighty grand, whatever,

204
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,565
but it's...

205
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,025
...it'll come back.

206
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,693
Till then, Lou,
we just keep going, okay?

207
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,070
- No.
- Lou?

208
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:27,279
- No.
- Listen to me.

209
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:28,906
Let's play tomorrow,
let's see what it's like.

210
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:30,074
Let's try it, okay?

211
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:31,909
I'm gonna be like a click track.
You can play to me.

212
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:32,952
No.

213
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:34,328
Huh? You can adj...
It's different,

214
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,830
but it is what it is, Lou.

215
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:43,671
Lou, we have a t...

216
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:44,880
Lou, we have a tour booked.

217
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:45,798
It's not safe...

218
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,675
We have a tour booked.

219
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,510
- We have a tour booked, Lou.
- No.

220
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,053
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

221
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:52,304
- Yes, we do.
- It's not safe, it's not safe.

222
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:53,639
We have a tour booked!

223
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,017
- Ruben.
- I don't fuckin'...

224
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,442
Yo!

225
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,154
You got a smoke, please?

226
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,935
This is ridiculous.

227
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:48,402
He's sleeping.

228
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,488
Hi.
Hi, Hector?

229
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:51,739
Hi, this is Lou.

230
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:53,616
Ruben's having a bit of...

231
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,742
a bit of trouble right now.

232
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:55,910
- He's...
- Hey, Hector, what's up?

233
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,661
He's got some hearing
problems.

234
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:00,873
Yeah, I mean I can put him on,

235
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:02,708
but he won't be able
to hear you.

236
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:04,919
Okay.

237
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:05,836
Talk to him.

238
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,379
Talk to him.

239
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,927
Hey, Hector,
what's going on, man?

240
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,303
It's Ruben.

241
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:15,846
I'd say it's good
to hear your voice,

242
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,890
but I can't hear a fuckin' word
you're saying right now.

243
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,600
So this is completely pointless.

244
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,228
Lou wanted me to call you
because I had a cigarette.

245
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:23,812
Uh...
you know...

246
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:25,689
not great, not ideal, but...

247
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,441
considering the circumstances,

248
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,068
which are pretty fucked up.

249
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:30,986
You know, understandable.

250
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:32,530
I'd say understandable,

251
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,573
for everyone apart from Lou,
it seems.

252
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:35,491
Um...

253
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:36,700
I got this, bro.

254
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:39,078
I know you'd probably be asking
me if I'm steady right now,

255
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,996
if I'm feeling level.

256
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,122
Not completely,

257
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:43,874
but I'm cool.

258
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,252
You'd tell me serenity
is something you get

259
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:47,920
when you, uh,

260
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,630
stop wishing
for a different past.

261
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:51,340
Bro, I love you, man.

262
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,634
Oh, my manager wants the phone back,

263
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:54,635
so I gotta go.

264
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,011
Okay, love you, bro.

265
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:58,597
Hey.

266
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,349
Yeah, he can't hear a word.

267
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,022
Well, if you get him to a group,
then how is he gonna hear?

268
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,360
Okay.

269
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:16,740
Okay, tha... thanks, Hector,
thank you.

270
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:17,992
When? When?

271
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,077
Okay, yeah,
I'll make sure it's on loud.

272
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:22,246
Okay, thank you so much,
thank you.

273
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,249
Okay, bye.

274
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:33,799
He's gonna call back.

275
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:36,302
What did he say?

276
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:37,928
Write it down. Tell... What did he...

277
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:46,145
"Call back."

278
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:50,107
He's gonna call back... that's all?

279
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,567
Fuckin' Hector.

280
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,779
What are we gonna do now?

281
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,874
What do you wanna do, Lou?

282
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,459
Huh?

283
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:29,355
Fuck this.

284
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:38,781
It's Hector.

285
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,037
Hey.

286
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:46,413
Yeah, he's here.

287
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,709
Not so good.

288
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,631
Oh...

289
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,091
Okay.

290
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,008
Uh...

291
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:58,926
yeah, what, what,

292
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,970
what is it and...

293
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,137
What?

294
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:03,556
What's the plan?

295
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:04,431
Uh...

296
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:07,393
Well, we're, we're in Missouri,

297
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,269
so that's gonna take

298
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:10,938
a few days.
I don't... I don't really know.

299
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:13,482
No, no...

300
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,151
No, we'll leave right away.

301
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:17,111
Okay, yeah.

302
00:25:18,154 --> 00:25:20,573
Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.
I really, really appreciate it.

303
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:22,032
Thank you.

304
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:24,201
No, yeah, I'll tell him.

305
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:26,162
Okay.
Bye.

306
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:32,376
What?

307
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:38,299
He's found a place.

308
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:41,630
Is that him?

309
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:52,641
Ruben.

310
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,311
Hi, I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't know that.

311
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:56,729
I'm Ruben.

312
00:27:57,062 --> 00:27:58,397
This is Lou.

313
00:27:58,522 --> 00:27:59,815
Hi, I'm... I'm Lou.

314
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,066
I'm sorry, I read lips.

315
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:02,151
My name is Lou.

316
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:05,070
- Lou. I'm Joe.
- Hi, Joe.

317
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,655
You mind if I borrow him
for a minute?

318
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,573
No.

319
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,950
All right, you mind
watching my beast here for me

320
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:11,035
while we have a talk?

321
00:28:11,243 --> 00:28:12,244
Well, okay.

322
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,538
- Lou, this is Louie.
- Oh.

323
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:15,956
He's my hearing dog.

324
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,583
He let me know you were here.

325
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:19,835
I named it after Louie Aparicio

326
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,545
from the White Sox in '59.

327
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:23,839
You want to be
best friends with him,

328
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,132
- give him one of these.
- Oh, sure.

329
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:26,383
- Okay?
- Yeah.

330
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,763
Yo, what about...

331
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,139
Lou, you coming?

332
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:33,015
No, no, you.

333
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:34,558
- You sure?
- Yeah.

334
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:35,768
I won't be long, okay?

335
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:37,061
Okay.

336
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:40,064
You be a good boy!

337
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:22,898
Okay.
Uh...

338
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,191
Test.

339
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:26,902
Oh.

340
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,544
Okay.
So,

341
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:44,920
it works.

342
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,798
Is this okay for you?

343
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,009
Yeah, can you hear me?

344
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:52,178
No. No, I'm gonna read your lips.

345
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:54,388
I might miss some things,
but I'm gonna try, okay?

346
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,724
- Okay.
- Just try, try to speak clearly.

347
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:57,850
Yeah.

348
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:02,521
How are you, Ruben?

349
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:08,027
I'm okay.

350
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,116
You're an addict?

351
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:17,203
Yeah.

352
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:21,040
What sort of drugs?

353
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,752
What'd I take?

354
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:26,504
Mm-hmm.

355
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,675
Everything.

356
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:33,344
Um...

357
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:36,263
Mainly heroin.

358
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:38,182
Heroin.

359
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:43,854
Have you thought about using
since you lost your hearing?

360
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:00,538
Today is not a good day.

361
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:10,005
I'm not thinking clear today.

362
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,469
Let's talk about me.

363
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:17,304
I'm an alcoholic.

364
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:20,266
I lost my hearing in
the Vietnam War

365
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,518
when a bomb exploded near me.

366
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:25,729
I still remember the music
I was listening to

367
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:26,981
when that bomb went off.

368
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:29,775
After that,

369
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:32,111
I lost everything else...

370
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:33,654
my wife,

371
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,573
my kid.

372
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,284
Not because of being deaf,
mind you, Ruben.

373
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:39,368
It was the beer.

374
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,165
How long you been clean?

375
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,293
Four years.

376
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:48,961
- Four?
- Mmm.

377
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:52,506
And you need some help
right now?

378
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:55,342
Yo, I should check on Lou.

379
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:59,263
How long you two
been together?

380
00:32:00,806 --> 00:32:02,266
Four years.

381
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,666
You play music, right?

382
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,210
- No.
- No?

383
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,294
No, not anymore.

384
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:32,296
Not until I get the implant.

385
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:33,797
Implant?

386
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:36,425
Yeah. Sorry, you know about
these implants they got now?

387
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,760
It's like... it's like, uh...

388
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:39,303
they have implants.

389
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:41,013
I know. Yes.

390
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:43,516
Expensive.

391
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,685
Yeah, thank you,
yes, they are.

392
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,062
So...

393
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,857
You should understand
that, uh...

394
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:53,400
this is a Deaf community,

395
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,694
not just my program,
but we're part

396
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:58,364
of a larger Deaf community.

397
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:00,032
And my program,

398
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,867
and the people in it,

399
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:02,868
they benefit

400
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:05,162
tremendously from that Deaf community.

401
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:06,747
We work with them

402
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,457
and they work with us.

403
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:09,875
But...

404
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,168
it's very important,

405
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:12,753
if you want to be here,

406
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:14,463
to understand
that we're looking for

407
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:15,840
a solution to...

408
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:17,633
to this...

409
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:20,302
...not this.

410
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:25,850
Why don't you go
invite Lou in here?

411
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:32,064
Sure.

412
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,651
Lou!

413
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,869
This guy wants to
talk to you.

414
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,495
Okay.

415
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:51,292
Well...

416
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,670
I think it's important that you stay here
with us right now, Ruben,

417
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:56,088
learn some sign language,

418
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:58,132
find some solid ground.

419
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:00,968
What do you think?

420
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:02,761
Man, it sounds great,

421
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:04,930
but we don't have
a lot of money right now.

422
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,182
Well, sometimes our church

423
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:07,933
sponsors deaf people in need, and

424
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:08,851
right now,

425
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,519
you fit the bill, Ruben.

426
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:12,021
We're really not

427
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:13,522
- churchgoing people.
- Sorry, I... I read...

428
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,065
Sorry, Ruben, I read lips.
I can't...

429
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:16,484
What'd you say?

430
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:18,736
We're not religious,

431
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:19,904
either of us.

432
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:21,405
Very much not into religion,

433
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,032
no offense, you know.

434
00:34:23,157 --> 00:34:25,117
Religion plays no part
in this, Ruben.

435
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:26,660
The church helps

436
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:28,704
people in need,
not religious people.

437
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,956
The important thing is that
you want to stay here.

438
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:31,874
Mmm.

439
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,501
Yeah.

440
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:34,835
Lou?

441
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,213
Do you think Ruben
needs help right now?

442
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,302
You understand, if, uh...

443
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,137
Ruben were to stay here,

444
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,972
he'd have to do it on his own.

445
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:49,224
Members live in a house

446
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,518
separate from the outside world.

447
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:52,102
No contact to the outside world,

448
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:54,063
no phones.

449
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,648
I've found that
in all cases,

450
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,398
that's the way it works best.

451
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:58,983
Yo, hold up a minute, okay?

452
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:00,110
Let me catch up.

453
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,362
Okay?

454
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,240
{\an8}Can you help Ruben commit
to that, Lou?

455
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,576
You want, you want to
try this for a couple days?

456
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:08,619
We have our own home.

457
00:35:08,744 --> 00:35:10,412
We can stay in the RV.

458
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:11,664
No, I'm sorry to say,

459
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:13,165
that's not the way
that it works here, Ruben.

460
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,209
Well, that's a problem, then.

461
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:18,045
Do you have anywhere you can
be during this time, Lou?

462
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:22,007
Yo, that's that, man.
We're done.

463
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,384
We're done.

464
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,718
Thanks a lot for
your time, bro.

465
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:25,678
Appreciate it, okay?

466
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:27,346
We're out, baby.
Let's go.

467
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:57,626
Hey.

468
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,044
Lou...

469
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:01,672
I'm thinking
we should still go hit

470
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:03,174
our fuckin' show
in Dayton.

471
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:05,342
Okay? I can, I can
fuckin' watch you

472
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,218
for cues.

473
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:08,053
I know it was rocky last time
but we did...

474
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:09,054
we weren't on the same page.

475
00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:10,890
Now you know what's up,
I can fuckin' watch you.

476
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,933
And I know this shit
inside out.

477
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:15,269
Okay, yo.
I can fuckin' make it work

478
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:17,646
until we have enough
for surgery.

479
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,940
Okay?
We're gonna get there.

480
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,943
Yo, seriously,
we're good to go.

481
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:24,695
Lou.

482
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:26,655
Hmm?

483
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:28,908
Hey, I'll deal with this shit.

484
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:30,159
I'll deal with it.

485
00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:31,744
You know I fucking will.
It's just money.

486
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:32,953
You know that, right?

487
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,871
Huh?

488
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,417
Come here.

489
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,809
Ruben!

490
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,021
Ruben!

491
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:00,564
Ruben!

492
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:01,607
Stop it!

493
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:10,074
Ruben!

494
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,215
Lou, look at me,
I'm not going back

495
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,675
to that fuckin' place,
okay?

496
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:31,303
I know.

497
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,013
I know.
I'm...

498
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:39,103
Well, then fuckin'
support me.

499
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,356
How's about that?
Fuckin' support me, Lou.

500
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:43,440
Huh?

501
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:46,986
You don't want to be here?

502
00:37:48,154 --> 00:37:49,280
Of course I do.

503
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,447
I knew it.
I fuckin' knew it.

504
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:51,782
I fuckin' knew this was coming.

505
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:52,825
I fuckin' knew it.

506
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,535
This is about
the fuckin' album, huh?

507
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:57,037
What happened?
You get a better offer?

508
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:58,247
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?

509
00:37:58,372 --> 00:37:59,165
- What are you saying?
- I can't hear,

510
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,417
I can't hear you.
I can't fucking hear you!

511
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,502
Do you understand me?
I can't, I'm fuckin' deaf.

512
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm fucking deaf!

513
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:06,130
No fucking hearing!

514
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,214
Okay?

515
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,507
Okay?

516
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:15,097
No, what I need, what I need is
a fucking gun in my mouth.

517
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:17,433
What I need is a fucking gun
in my fucking mouth!

518
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:18,517
Okay?!

519
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,482
Look, I'm sorry.

520
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,026
Lou, I'm just fucked up a little.

521
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:29,153
I just need a little...
I need a minute to think.

522
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,154
Okay?

523
00:38:32,198 --> 00:38:34,074
There's gotta be another way.

524
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,201
Lou?

525
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:39,497
Hello?

526
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,207
Hey.

527
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:44,877
Oh, really?

528
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,546
Oh.

529
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,881
Who is that?

530
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,091
Okay, well,
I need to get ready. Okay.

531
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,468
No, I'll get a cab.

532
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,095
Yeah, it's fine.

533
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,640
Okay, bye.

534
00:38:58,682 --> 00:39:00,351
What's going on?

535
00:39:00,768 --> 00:39:01,727
Huh?

536
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,479
What's going on?

537
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:06,649
I'm getting on a plane
and you're gonna go back to that place.

538
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:13,614
Just slow down, okay?

539
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:14,615
Slow down!

540
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,033
Yo, chill dude,
we're gonna be a minute.

541
00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:17,535
Just chill.
Okay?

542
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:19,995
Just slow down a minute.

543
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,622
Lou.

544
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,707
Lou.
This is so fucked up.

545
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,501
Who's gonna be looking out
for you over there?

546
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,544
Hmm?

547
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:27,795
- Who's gonna look out for you?
- It's okay.

548
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,255
- Don't say that guy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

549
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,548
Lou, I need, I need more
of a plan, Lou.

550
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:31,757
- Ruben.
- I need...

551
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,968
I need more from you, Lou.

552
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:44,144
I need more of a plan, Lou.

553
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,272
You can't just fuckin'...

554
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,366
Ah, Jesus.

555
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:58,450
Lou, come on.

556
00:39:58,534 --> 00:39:59,326
Ruben.

557
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:00,828
Ruben.

558
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,372
You hurt yourself...

559
00:40:03,455 --> 00:40:05,166
Ruben. You hurt yourself,

560
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,001
you hurt me.

561
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:08,711
I'll hurt myself, too.

562
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:09,753
I'll hurt myself, too.

563
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:11,046
Don't say that.

564
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,507
Promise.

565
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:15,301
Say it, Rubi,
or all of this is for shit.

566
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:16,719
Say it!
Promise!

567
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,220
Go back there right now.

568
00:40:18,304 --> 00:40:19,138
Promise, say it!

569
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:20,431
I'll promise if you...

570
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:21,932
No, say it, promise.

571
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:27,479
Go back to that place.

572
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,231
I, only if, I need...

573
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,150
I need you to wait for me.

574
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:34,153
Okay? You're it for me, Lou.
You're my fuckin' heart.

575
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,529
You're it for me.

576
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,907
Okay?
You gotta wait for me.

577
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:47,208
Fuck.

578
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:52,046
Listen to me, listen, listen.

579
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,173
When you get there,
I need you to,

580
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,384
I need you to write to me, okay?

581
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,802
Yeah?
Will you write me

582
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,304
and tell me you're okay?

583
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,306
Huh? Promise me?

584
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:03,766
And listen, if it's...

585
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,768
If it's bullshit, you just get
your ass back here.

586
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:07,228
I'll fix it, I swear to God.

587
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:08,479
You know
I'll fuckin' fix this.

588
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,147
This is not that hard, okay?

589
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:11,899
Just come back here.

590
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:17,404
- I love you.
- You're my fucking heart.

591
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:18,656
Okay?

592
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,993
Motherfucker.

593
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:24,954
Oh, motherf...

594
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:34,296
Fuck.

595
00:41:38,884 --> 00:41:40,344
Motherfucker.

596
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:48,686
Oh.

597
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,985
Fuck.

598
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,071
Motherfucker.

599
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,085
What's up?

600
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:57,922
Yo.

601
00:42:58,172 --> 00:42:59,089
Hey.

602
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:28,994
You want my car keys?

603
00:43:40,256 --> 00:43:41,257
If I ask for 'em back,

604
00:43:41,382 --> 00:43:42,925
I want 'em back, okay?

605
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:48,556
We're not doing that.

606
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:05,174
Your name.

607
00:45:06,342 --> 00:45:07,593
My name's Ruben.

608
00:45:07,968 --> 00:45:09,386
I'm an addict.

609
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:11,305
I have four years clean now.

610
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:13,098
I'm sorry I don't...

611
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:15,017
talk sign language.

612
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,143
That's it.

613
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:56,535
Oh...

614
00:46:57,453 --> 00:46:58,454
Fuck.

615
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:18,344
What?

616
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:22,515
Okay.

617
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:07,142
Um...
I don't...

618
00:50:07,268 --> 00:50:08,894
Sorry.

619
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,209
Ruben.

620
00:50:33,252 --> 00:50:34,086
Ru-ben.

621
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:11,582
Oh.

622
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:30,559
Okay.

623
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:37,107
Yeah.

624
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:33,414
Uh, I'm coming.

625
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:34,832
Okay?
One minute.

626
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:36,917
I'll be back.

627
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:26,068
Oh, hey, Joe.

628
00:54:31,824 --> 00:54:33,284
What was that
all about, Ruben?

629
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,080
Oh, with your roof?

630
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:40,166
I was fixing your roof.

631
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:41,667
It's like, one of the eaves is...

632
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,294
I was trying to fix your roof.

633
00:54:44,336 --> 00:54:45,462
You don't need to fix

634
00:54:45,546 --> 00:54:46,839
anything here.

635
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:54,138
Okay.

636
00:54:58,893 --> 00:55:00,227
I've got a little, uh...

637
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:01,353
assignment for ya.

638
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:02,479
Okay?

639
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:04,648
You get up early, right?

640
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,526
Yeah, pretty early, yeah.

641
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,279
I'll have hot coffee

642
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:11,906
waiting for you

643
00:55:12,198 --> 00:55:13,574
at 5:30.

644
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:16,202
Early enough for you?

645
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:21,499
I don't know.
I guess.

646
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:23,083
Okay, 5:00.

647
00:55:24,084 --> 00:55:25,127
And I'll, uh,

648
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:27,755
provide a room for you.

649
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:29,465
What for?

650
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:32,593
And there's nothing that needs
to be accomplished in this room.

651
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:35,554
All I want you to do
is just...

652
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:37,765
...sit.

653
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:42,561
All I ask

654
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:45,022
is if and when you
cannot just sit,

655
00:55:45,314 --> 00:55:46,524
you turn yourself to the

656
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:47,483
pen and paper

657
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,485
that I'm gonna supply for you.

658
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:51,862
And I want you to...

659
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:54,657
...write.

660
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,077
Doesn't matter what you write,
how you write,

661
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,912
whether it's spelled correctly.

662
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:02,665
Or if it's just a big...

663
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:03,833
...mess.

664
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,252
I don't care.

665
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:08,379
No one will read it, okay?

666
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:11,173
But I want you to keep writing

667
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:13,133
continuously without stopping

668
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:15,219
until you feel like
you can...

669
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,807
sit again.

670
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:36,991
Does it have to be writing?

671
00:56:37,116 --> 00:56:38,659
Writing, yes.
No drawing.

672
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:40,035
Writing, yes.

673
00:56:45,457 --> 00:56:46,458
And if...

674
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:47,626
...sometime in the future,

675
00:56:48,043 --> 00:56:50,629
it feels like it's a little bit
too difficult for you,

676
00:56:51,213 --> 00:56:52,965
you should come and find me.

677
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:55,885
I'll be in my apartment

678
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:59,513
doing the same thing as you,
okay, Ruben?

679
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:06,395
I'll be writing, too.

680
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:10,983
Okay.

681
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:45,870
Ah!

682
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:56,172
Ah!

683
00:58:58,424 --> 00:58:59,675
Ah!

684
00:59:04,597 --> 00:59:05,848
Mmm, nice.

685
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:07,808
Nice, nice, nice.

686
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:09,768
So fuckin' stupid.

687
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:19,653
It's so fuckin' stupid.

688
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:25,201
You fuckin' idiot.

689
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,216
I'm a fuckin' idiot.

690
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:36,920
Hey.

691
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,340
You think he's okay?

692
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,511
You okay?

693
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,429
No.

694
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,639
Not feeling better? Come on over.

695
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,185
Look at those flowers.

696
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,112
He's quick.

697
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,003
Alright, come here, my friend.

698
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,381
See, I knew he had it.

699
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,576
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

700
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,287
H, I, J, K, L, M, N...

701
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,373
R, S, T, U, V,

702
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,458
W, X, Y, Z.

703
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,673
He won.

704
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,716
-No, no, he won.
-It was close.

705
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,718
No, he won. You can go
again if you want to.

706
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,637
Again! Again! Again! Again!

707
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:14,518
A, B, C, D,

708
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,853
G, H, I, J, K, L,

709
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,480
T, U, V,

710
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:19,565
O, Q...

711
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:21,608
R, S, T, U, V, W,

712
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,652
X, Y, Z.

713
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:24,736
Yes!

714
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:28,615
See?

715
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:30,576
Good job! You did it!

716
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,082
No, I thought...

717
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,960
I thought you said you were smart.

718
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,006
But your wife and your daughter
are better, right?

719
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,258
See?

720
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,343
He knows!

721
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,387
He already knows.

722
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,817
I don't like it completely shaved.

723
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:48,153
I prefer it with a little hair.

724
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:00,457
Whoa, not too much.

725
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,667
Natural, got it.

726
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,627
Trimmed and all, ya know?

727
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:09,633
Lovely.

728
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,093
Who is she?

729
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,556
Okay, okay.

730
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,145
Where do you want it?

731
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,400
Right here.

732
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:33,740
I like it.

733
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,962
Cool. Thank you.

734
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:08,024
My bad.

735
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,484
Watch me.

736
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,446
Slowly.

737
01:08:27,493 --> 01:08:29,662
I feel a little bit old today.

738
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:34,040
- You are old.
- Yeah.

739
01:08:36,835 --> 01:08:37,920
I love your name sign...

740
01:08:38,045 --> 01:08:39,129
...Ruben.

741
01:08:42,424 --> 01:08:44,259
That first day you were here

742
01:08:44,802 --> 01:08:46,637
you reminded me of an owl.

743
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,293
O-W-L?

744
01:08:50,348 --> 01:08:51,392
{\an8}Owl.

745
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:52,712
Fuck you.

746
01:09:02,402 --> 01:09:04,737
And you've become very important

747
01:09:04,946 --> 01:09:06,866
to a lot of people around here.

748
01:09:08,868 --> 01:09:09,701
You know?

749
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:10,828
It's true.

750
01:09:11,036 --> 01:09:12,288
Thank you.

751
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:16,375
I'd like to offer you a...

752
01:09:17,168 --> 01:09:18,169
...a way that

753
01:09:18,294 --> 01:09:20,295
maybe you can continue on here

754
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:21,463
with us.

755
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:23,883
I imagine you're starting

756
01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:25,384
to think about the future

757
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:26,802
a little bit?

758
01:09:27,094 --> 01:09:28,804
- Future?
- Future.

759
01:09:29,597 --> 01:09:30,848
I know I am.

760
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:34,602
But, uh...

761
01:09:34,727 --> 01:09:36,187
I do think there's a way

762
01:09:36,312 --> 01:09:38,438
you could maybe stay
and work here,

763
01:09:39,356 --> 01:09:41,317
maybe with my program,

764
01:09:42,317 --> 01:09:43,486
maybe...

765
01:09:44,027 --> 01:09:45,446
...with the kids at school.

766
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:48,115
Maybe both.

767
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,661
Anyway...

768
01:09:55,205 --> 01:09:56,415
you, uh...

769
01:09:56,749 --> 01:09:58,292
you think about it,
you know?

770
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:20,291
What the fuck?

771
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:22,932
Her?

772
01:14:23,974 --> 01:14:24,975
Yeah.

773
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,466
Sexy.

774
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:32,942
Yeah.
Cute.

775
01:14:34,693 --> 01:14:35,903
What do you think, huh?

776
01:14:35,986 --> 01:14:36,987
Yo, what do you think?

777
01:14:37,696 --> 01:14:39,031
This?

778
01:14:41,408 --> 01:14:42,451
Yeah.

779
01:14:44,036 --> 01:14:45,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

780
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:46,288
Wait, yo, it's easy.

781
01:14:46,413 --> 01:14:47,206
It's easy. Just...

782
01:14:47,289 --> 01:14:48,290
...slowly.

783
01:14:49,124 --> 01:14:51,210
Yo...
...It's for her, huh?

784
01:14:51,293 --> 01:14:52,211
It's for her.

785
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:53,337
We need money.

786
01:14:53,462 --> 01:14:55,047
We need money.

787
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,091
Huh?
It's for us.

788
01:15:00,302 --> 01:15:01,595
I'm leveling with you.

789
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,013
It's for her.

790
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:23,659
Yo.
For this... for this?

791
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:25,077
For this,

792
01:15:25,161 --> 01:15:26,704
remember it's, uh... it's, uh...

793
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:28,789
cash.
Okay? Not check.

794
01:15:29,165 --> 01:15:29,957
Cool.

795
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,041
Yo?

796
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,084
You okay?

797
01:15:32,668 --> 01:15:34,044
Sure?

798
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:04,552
Hi, is that Prince Audiology?

799
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:05,886
Can you hear me?

800
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,226
It's Stone, Ruben Stone.

801
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:13,894
R-U-B-E-N,

802
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:17,231
Stone, S-T-O-N-E.

803
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:19,483
I'm confirming an appointment.

804
01:17:24,071 --> 01:17:25,364
Yeah, I can hold.

805
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,661
So, listen.

806
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:55,162
- What did you say? Write it down.
- Yeah, yeah.

807
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:56,664
I can't hear you.
Write it down.

808
01:19:19,103 --> 01:19:20,813
I got a proposition for you.

809
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,815
What's that?

810
01:19:23,107 --> 01:19:24,650
What if I give it to you
at this price...

811
01:19:27,486 --> 01:19:29,947
...but on one condition.

812
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,243
I have the option
of coming back to you

813
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:35,619
within eight weeks.

814
01:19:36,412 --> 01:19:37,371
Okay?

815
01:19:37,454 --> 01:19:40,332
I get to buy it back off you
for ten percent more than this.

816
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,960
But everything has to be
in its current condition.

817
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:45,421
Everything has to be exactly
like it is now.

818
01:19:46,505 --> 01:19:47,590
Hmm?

819
01:19:47,923 --> 01:19:49,133
What do you think?

820
01:19:50,259 --> 01:19:51,260
Why would you want
to do that?

821
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:52,761
Dude, I can't hear you.
I'm deaf.

822
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:54,680
So... It's...
take it or leave it.

823
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:56,182
What's it gonna be?

824
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:11,650
You're back?

825
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,113
Have a seat here.

826
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:18,309
Thank you.

827
01:22:29,084 --> 01:22:29,877
Um...

828
01:22:31,504 --> 01:22:33,547
...I did the deed.

829
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:35,925
The deed?

830
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:42,306
Surgery.

831
01:22:51,023 --> 01:22:52,566
How'd you get the money?

832
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:54,527
I sold my RV

833
01:22:54,693 --> 01:22:55,694
and other shit.

834
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:00,741
- Okay.
- Look, Joe,

835
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:01,700
I really

836
01:23:01,784 --> 01:23:03,994
don't want to explain myself
right now.

837
01:23:04,495 --> 01:23:05,496
Okay?

838
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:08,749
It's time.
Okay?

839
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,960
It's time.
I gotta do something.

840
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:12,962
Right?

841
01:23:13,128 --> 01:23:14,088
Trying to save my f...

842
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,589
fuckin' life.

843
01:23:17,591 --> 01:23:18,676
So, that's what
I'm doing.

844
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:20,970
Okay? No one else is gonna
save my life.

845
01:23:21,887 --> 01:23:22,888
Right?

846
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:26,016
If I just sit here and diddle around,

847
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:27,226
what am I gonna have?
Nothing.

848
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:29,144
Okay?

849
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:32,565
And all this shit?
Like, what does it matter? What does it matter?

850
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:33,566
It just passes.

851
01:23:34,066 --> 01:23:34,984
Yo.

852
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:36,318
If I disappear,

853
01:23:36,819 --> 01:23:38,070
like, who cares?

854
01:23:38,821 --> 01:23:40,072
Nobody cares, man.

855
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:41,198
Seriously.

856
01:23:41,323 --> 01:23:42,283
Yo, and that's okay.

857
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:43,450
That's life.

858
01:23:44,451 --> 01:23:45,411
That's life.

859
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,872
No, for real. Okay?

860
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,165
It just passes.

861
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,082
It just fuckin'...

862
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,375
fucking passes.

863
01:23:56,422 --> 01:23:58,132
I wonder, uh...

864
01:23:58,716 --> 01:24:01,010
all these mornings
you've been sitting in my study,

865
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:03,095
sitting,

866
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,515
have you...

867
01:24:07,016 --> 01:24:08,017
had any...

868
01:24:09,226 --> 01:24:10,477
moments of...

869
01:24:10,853 --> 01:24:12,354
...stillness?

870
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,777
Because you're right, Ruben,

871
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:20,529
the world does keep moving,

872
01:24:20,613 --> 01:24:22,656
and it can be a damn...

873
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:23,741
...cruel place.

874
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:26,869
But for me...

875
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,248
those moments of...

876
01:24:31,624 --> 01:24:33,042
...stillness,

877
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,502
that place,

878
01:24:34,585 --> 01:24:35,419
that's the...

879
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,213
...kingdom of God.

880
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,135
And that place

881
01:24:43,677 --> 01:24:45,262
will never abandon you.

882
01:24:48,724 --> 01:24:50,017
But...

883
01:24:53,729 --> 01:24:54,772
I see you've made your

884
01:24:54,855 --> 01:24:55,773
choice.

885
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,982
Right?

886
01:24:58,359 --> 01:24:59,527
Yeah.

887
01:25:01,987 --> 01:25:03,948
And I sincerely hope

888
01:25:04,657 --> 01:25:06,826
that it brings you happiness, Ruben.

889
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,399
Thank you.

890
01:25:17,628 --> 01:25:18,671
I was wondering, Joe.

891
01:25:18,754 --> 01:25:20,381
I don't know if it's possible,

892
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:24,552
but, uh...

893
01:25:25,177 --> 01:25:26,637
I need money,

894
01:25:26,971 --> 01:25:27,763
to, uh...

895
01:25:27,888 --> 01:25:29,306
just to buy back my RV.

896
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,141
You know?

897
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,269
You know, me...
me and Lou.

898
01:25:33,352 --> 01:25:34,895
This is where we live.

899
01:25:35,062 --> 01:25:37,940
It's our home. Our home.

900
01:25:38,482 --> 01:25:39,275
And I can...

901
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,484
I can totally pay you back.

902
01:25:41,026 --> 01:25:42,194
Just, uh...

903
01:25:42,903 --> 01:25:44,196
Now I got an issue with time.

904
01:25:51,871 --> 01:25:52,997
Ruben.

905
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,669
I don't understand the situation
that you've put yourself in.

906
01:25:59,378 --> 01:26:00,504
But...

907
01:26:00,754 --> 01:26:02,131
from where I'm sitting...

908
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,924
you look

909
01:26:04,008 --> 01:26:04,842
and sound

910
01:26:04,884 --> 01:26:05,843
like an addict.

911
01:26:06,468 --> 01:26:07,303
No, I don't.

912
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:08,304
Yo, no.

913
01:26:08,971 --> 01:26:09,889
I'm not...

914
01:26:09,972 --> 01:26:10,806
It's not...

915
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,807
Not an addi...

916
01:26:12,892 --> 01:26:13,809
It's fine. Okay?

917
01:26:13,893 --> 01:26:14,852
My situation,

918
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:15,811
it's cool.

919
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:16,770
Okay?

920
01:26:17,354 --> 01:26:19,940
Seriously, my girlfriend's dad is rich,

921
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:21,650
he can give me...
give me the money.

922
01:26:21,901 --> 01:26:23,068
Okay?
This is nothing.

923
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:24,862
You can't imagine how nothing this is.

924
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:26,780
Seriously.

925
01:26:29,783 --> 01:26:30,743
I'm fucking stupid...

926
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:32,077
I'm... I'm sorry to ask.

927
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:33,162
I'm sorry.

928
01:26:33,496 --> 01:26:34,455
Okay?

929
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:36,624
Okay.

930
01:26:43,797 --> 01:26:45,841
Please can I stay here for just...

931
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,719
three, four weeks?

932
01:26:48,844 --> 01:26:50,012
Till they...

933
01:26:50,888 --> 01:26:51,805
activate?

934
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:00,189
Ruben.

935
01:27:01,732 --> 01:27:02,775
As you know,

936
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:04,276
everybody here

937
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,903
shares in the belief that

938
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:07,905
being deaf is not a handicap.

939
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:10,366
Not something to fix.

940
01:27:12,743 --> 01:27:14,453
It's pretty important
around here.

941
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:18,707
All these kids...

942
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,002
all of us,

943
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,505
need to be reminded of it

944
01:27:25,381 --> 01:27:26,590
every day.

945
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:31,136
And my house

946
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:33,430
is a house built on that belief,

947
01:27:33,556 --> 01:27:34,890
and built on trust.

948
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,854
And when that trust is violated,

949
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:41,730
things happen.

950
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:50,823
And I can't have that.

951
01:27:52,324 --> 01:27:54,368
There are too many others

952
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:55,452
to consider.

953
01:27:58,831 --> 01:27:59,623
And so,

954
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:01,917
in your current state,

955
01:28:02,459 --> 01:28:03,544
at this time,

956
01:28:05,337 --> 01:28:08,340
I'm going to have to ask you to pack up
your bags, today,

957
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:12,136
and find another place to be, Ruben.

958
01:28:26,775 --> 01:28:28,068
Cool.

959
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:46,856
Ah.

960
01:31:33,212 --> 01:31:34,547
Are you ready?

961
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,008
Okay.

962
01:31:47,643 --> 01:31:48,853
Here we go.

963
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,699
Can you hear me?

964
01:32:08,164 --> 01:32:09,123
Say again.

965
01:32:09,331 --> 01:32:11,000
- Can you hear me?
- Whoa.

966
01:32:12,418 --> 01:32:13,711
How does it sound?

967
01:32:16,755 --> 01:32:18,799
Uh, sounds weird.

968
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,136
Okay, well, let's try

969
01:32:22,261 --> 01:32:23,762
making an adjustment.

970
01:32:28,726 --> 01:32:30,311
How about now?
How's that?

971
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:32,521
Oh, that's bad.

972
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:33,981
Um...

973
01:32:36,734 --> 01:32:38,652
It's... bad.

974
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:42,448
Do you want to describe
what you're hearing?

975
01:32:42,531 --> 01:32:43,782
It's, um...

976
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:46,660
It's like...

977
01:32:47,036 --> 01:32:48,329
...high.
High.

978
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,248
Um...

979
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,796
Can you change the...

980
01:33:00,549 --> 01:33:01,842
Well, I can try and make

981
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:03,135
another adjustment.

982
01:33:07,473 --> 01:33:08,891
How's that?

983
01:33:12,645 --> 01:33:13,437
Okay.

984
01:33:13,771 --> 01:33:17,066
Ruben, this is not sound
like you remember,

985
01:33:17,274 --> 01:33:18,651
and it's the implants

986
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:19,693
in your head that's

987
01:33:19,777 --> 01:33:20,861
tricking your brain

988
01:33:20,945 --> 01:33:21,862
into thinking that you're

989
01:33:21,946 --> 01:33:23,823
actually hearing,

990
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,157
when

991
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:26,992
in reality your ears

992
01:33:27,076 --> 01:33:28,202
aren't working still.

993
01:33:31,247 --> 01:33:32,039
So, uh,

994
01:33:32,122 --> 01:33:33,499
I would suggest that you

995
01:33:33,582 --> 01:33:34,708
take it easy

996
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:36,877
for the next few weeks and...

997
01:33:37,419 --> 01:33:38,420
just...

998
01:33:39,463 --> 01:33:41,507
get adjusted to...

999
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:42,800
how things sound.

1000
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:48,013
And just...

1001
01:33:48,097 --> 01:33:49,473
...take your time.

1002
01:35:48,634 --> 01:35:49,802
Oui?

1003
01:35:50,427 --> 01:35:51,220
Bonjour?

1004
01:35:52,263 --> 01:35:54,181
Yeah, hi, is that, um...

1005
01:35:54,723 --> 01:35:56,642
Is, is Lou there?

1006
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,186
Hein?
C'est qui?

1007
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:01,188
Who... who is this?

1008
01:36:02,606 --> 01:36:04,024
This is Ruben.

1009
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:05,985
Qui?

1010
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:08,154
It's Ruben.

1011
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,115
Oh.

1012
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:12,324
Hmm.

1013
01:36:30,759 --> 01:36:31,677
Hey.

1014
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,221
Bonjour, uh...?

1015
01:36:34,763 --> 01:36:35,723
Ruben.

1016
01:36:35,806 --> 01:36:36,932
Come in.

1017
01:36:41,437 --> 01:36:43,147
You are hungry, Ruben?

1018
01:36:46,275 --> 01:36:47,568
Yes?

1019
01:37:00,122 --> 01:37:01,540
Uh, Louise is not here.

1020
01:37:05,002 --> 01:37:06,295
Uh, you are hearing?

1021
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,088
Y... You are hearing?

1022
01:37:08,172 --> 01:37:09,048
Yeah.

1023
01:37:09,173 --> 01:37:10,341
I... I had an operation.

1024
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,635
Wow!
Yes?

1025
01:37:16,972 --> 01:37:18,641
Oh!
What is this?

1026
01:37:19,975 --> 01:37:21,101
Oh, that's very good.

1027
01:37:21,185 --> 01:37:23,354
Louise told me
your wish for this.

1028
01:37:26,148 --> 01:37:27,399
Oh.

1029
01:37:30,402 --> 01:37:31,862
And so, uh...

1030
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:35,449
So, you're back to your drums now?

1031
01:37:36,283 --> 01:37:37,910
Uh, not yet.

1032
01:37:37,993 --> 01:37:39,578
I gotta, I gotta, um,

1033
01:37:39,703 --> 01:37:41,163
I gotta deal with some stuff first,

1034
01:37:41,247 --> 01:37:42,498
you know?

1035
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:43,415
Just gotta...

1036
01:37:43,707 --> 01:37:44,917
gotta settle some things.

1037
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:47,211
Yes, settle...

1038
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:48,546
...like what?

1039
01:37:48,671 --> 01:37:50,464
You know, just like

1040
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,966
getting back into it

1041
01:37:52,049 --> 01:37:54,218
- and also some financial stuff.
- Yes.

1042
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:55,594
You know,
I just gotta figure it all out.

1043
01:37:55,719 --> 01:37:56,595
Mm-hmm.

1044
01:37:57,721 --> 01:37:58,722
Yes.

1045
01:37:59,181 --> 01:38:01,016
And Louise knows
that you're here?

1046
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:02,560
No.
No.

1047
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:04,645
So, it's a big surprise, oui?

1048
01:38:11,527 --> 01:38:12,570
Well, Louise has been

1049
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:13,487
quite busy, you know?

1050
01:38:14,738 --> 01:38:16,198
Mm-hmm.

1051
01:38:16,907 --> 01:38:19,368
We're doing a party, so...

1052
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:21,370
...she'll be back home tonight, that's

1053
01:38:21,912 --> 01:38:23,455
most certainly.

1054
01:38:29,086 --> 01:38:30,087
Oh, you want...

1055
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:32,590
I'm going to make you some eggs.

1056
01:38:32,923 --> 01:38:34,049
Oh, no, I'm good.

1057
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:35,801
Do you need any help
with any of this?

1058
01:38:35,926 --> 01:38:37,011
No, no.

1059
01:38:37,136 --> 01:38:38,637
You need some eggs.

1060
01:38:40,055 --> 01:38:40,931
Thanks.

1061
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:45,561
Where did you grow, Ruben?

1062
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:48,147
Where did I grow up?

1063
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:49,690
- Yes.
- Um...

1064
01:38:49,773 --> 01:38:50,733
like, all over.

1065
01:38:51,066 --> 01:38:53,152
You know, Texas, California,

1066
01:38:54,153 --> 01:38:55,404
Arizona, Virginia.

1067
01:38:56,197 --> 01:38:57,364
Yeah.
All over.

1068
01:38:57,573 --> 01:38:59,158
Why so many places?

1069
01:39:00,743 --> 01:39:01,535
It was...

1070
01:39:01,744 --> 01:39:02,828
like, uh...

1071
01:39:02,953 --> 01:39:05,289
my mom was a nurse in the military.

1072
01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:06,790
- Mm-hmm.
- You know.

1073
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:08,918
So she kept moving around.

1074
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:10,419
And your father, too?

1075
01:39:10,669 --> 01:39:11,629
No.

1076
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:12,755
I mean, I don't know.

1077
01:39:13,797 --> 01:39:14,798
I see.

1078
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:20,679
Uh, I must be honest, I...

1079
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:23,265
did not always have good feelings

1080
01:39:23,349 --> 01:39:24,350
for you, Ruben,

1081
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:26,018
all these years.

1082
01:39:27,144 --> 01:39:29,605
I confide it is like if one...

1083
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:33,901
had stolen something...

1084
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:34,985
...precious.

1085
01:39:36,362 --> 01:39:37,655
You understand?

1086
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:39,907
But I know it's not you that took

1087
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:41,575
Louise from me.

1088
01:39:43,244 --> 01:39:44,870
Her mother did that.

1089
01:39:47,331 --> 01:39:49,542
She took Louise
when she left me.

1090
01:39:50,042 --> 01:39:51,710
And she took her again

1091
01:39:51,836 --> 01:39:53,546
when she killed herself.

1092
01:39:56,674 --> 01:40:00,010
And Louise must have
come back home then,

1093
01:40:00,177 --> 01:40:02,471
but she was hating me so much.

1094
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:04,181
What could I do?

1095
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:05,808
And you...

1096
01:40:05,891 --> 01:40:07,017
you...

1097
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:11,438
Well, you gave her a place
to go.

1098
01:40:12,815 --> 01:40:14,400
Then, and...

1099
01:40:14,859 --> 01:40:16,485
...this is a good thing.

1100
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,823
Don't you see, I didn't like you
much at the time,

1101
01:40:20,906 --> 01:40:22,491
but now I thank you.

1102
01:40:22,616 --> 01:40:24,243
I want to say to you that.

1103
01:40:27,371 --> 01:40:28,414
But anyhow,

1104
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:30,082
you're gonna be
so happy to see

1105
01:40:30,166 --> 01:40:31,208
how Louise

1106
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,335
is going great now.

1107
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:36,297
And that's the most important.

1108
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:38,757
Isn't it?

1109
01:40:40,426 --> 01:40:41,510
Hmm?

1110
01:40:42,011 --> 01:40:43,137
Okay.

1111
01:41:28,057 --> 01:41:28,849
Whoa.

1112
01:41:30,142 --> 01:41:32,603
Whoa!

1113
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:33,854
Hi.

1114
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:35,981
Can you hear me?

1115
01:41:36,315 --> 01:41:37,942
Yeah.
Loud and clear.

1116
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,070
Oh, look at you, Lulu.

1117
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:42,613
Holy shit.

1118
01:41:44,532 --> 01:41:45,449
Look at you, huh?

1119
01:41:45,533 --> 01:41:46,534
What?

1120
01:41:46,659 --> 01:41:48,202
You look different.

1121
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,374
Whoa, no scratching, huh?

1122
01:41:54,291 --> 01:41:55,376
Oh, yeah.

1123
01:41:56,544 --> 01:41:57,878
That's good.

1124
01:42:17,648 --> 01:42:18,858
Does it feel weird?

1125
01:42:19,275 --> 01:42:20,901
Yeah.
Does it look weird?

1126
01:42:21,026 --> 01:42:21,819
No.

1127
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:24,321
No, it doesn't.
It looks really neat.

1128
01:42:25,447 --> 01:42:26,365
Mmm.

1129
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:28,993
So crazy.

1130
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:29,994
Mm-hmm.

1131
01:42:31,328 --> 01:42:32,454
How'd you do it?

1132
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,248
Just worked some magic.

1133
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:38,127
I have to talk to you about it.

1134
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,380
I had to just move
some things around.

1135
01:42:41,547 --> 01:42:42,882
Louise, tu desends?

1136
01:42:44,842 --> 01:42:45,676
Um...

1137
01:42:46,552 --> 01:42:48,429
Did Richard tell you
about this party thing tonight?

1138
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:50,389
Oh, shit, yeah.

1139
01:42:50,514 --> 01:42:52,600
Yeah, I just have to go
and sort some things out.

1140
01:42:52,725 --> 01:42:54,185
- No, it's great. It's cool.
- Yeah.

1141
01:42:55,311 --> 01:42:56,937
- Go do your thing.
- Okay.

1142
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:59,315
Do you need anything?

1143
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,233
No, I'm good.

1144
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:03,569
I'll just be downstairs.

1145
01:44:01,502 --> 01:44:02,586
Hey.

1146
01:44:02,753 --> 01:44:04,755
Ruben, mon petite ami.

1147
01:44:06,298 --> 01:44:07,174
What's up?

1148
01:44:08,425 --> 01:44:10,052
- Come again?
- How are you?

1149
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,180
How are you?

1150
01:44:14,056 --> 01:44:15,558
- Did you get some food?
- Hmm?

1151
01:44:15,683 --> 01:44:16,976
Get some food?

1152
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:19,520
Yeah?

1153
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,470
I would like to make a wish.

1154
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:14,892
I would like my daughter to
sing a little song with me.

1155
01:45:14,976 --> 01:45:15,977
Papa, no.

1156
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,730
This is my right... It's my birthday!

1157
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:20,356
Come.

1158
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,233
Oh!

1159
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,611
Some of you knew

1160
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:27,405
Louise's mother,

1161
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:29,615
and know that I wrote songs for her...

1162
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,034
...many.

1163
01:45:31,576 --> 01:45:34,704
And this was your favorite
when you were little.

1164
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:36,748
Do you remember?

1165
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,058
Hey.

1166
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:30,688
You okay?

1167
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,147
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

1168
01:49:04,722 --> 01:49:06,432
Um, sorry.

1169
01:49:06,557 --> 01:49:08,184
I just need some water.

1170
01:49:13,814 --> 01:49:14,732
Are you okay?

1171
01:49:15,357 --> 01:49:17,109
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

1172
01:49:17,193 --> 01:49:19,028
Yeah, it's just
a little dry in here.

1173
01:49:24,825 --> 01:49:26,327
{\an8}Hey, that was, uh...

1174
01:49:26,619 --> 01:49:28,037
{\an8}pretty cool tonight.

1175
01:49:29,413 --> 01:49:30,623
{\an8}You sounded fuckin' great.

1176
01:49:30,831 --> 01:49:32,166
- Yeah, right.
- What?

1177
01:49:32,249 --> 01:49:33,792
You're telling me
you weren't feeling it?

1178
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,794
- You were in it.
- Well, yeah, well, that's...

1179
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,796
Straight up, you sounded
amazing singing like that.

1180
01:49:37,922 --> 01:49:39,507
It's my dad's stuff, but...

1181
01:49:40,549 --> 01:49:41,967
{\an8}And you're
speaking French now?

1182
01:49:42,092 --> 01:49:44,678
{\an8}- Oh, my God, barely.
- I didn't know you could do that.

1183
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:46,931
{\an8}Well, I've mostly forgotten, but...

1184
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,099
{\an8}it's coming back a little.

1185
01:49:50,267 --> 01:49:52,019
{\an8}Yeah, I was thinking, like,
do you remember,

1186
01:49:52,186 --> 01:49:53,812
{\an8}you remember this place
at all?

1187
01:49:55,481 --> 01:49:56,774
I didn't, but...

1188
01:49:57,775 --> 01:49:59,693
...so disconcerting the things that

1189
01:49:59,777 --> 01:50:01,320
your memory holds onto

1190
01:50:01,403 --> 01:50:02,988
without you knowing.

1191
01:50:04,365 --> 01:50:05,157
I don't know, my...

1192
01:50:05,282 --> 01:50:06,951
my mom and I never really
talked about this place.

1193
01:50:07,076 --> 01:50:09,411
It was always some
weird, dreamy idea, but...

1194
01:50:10,454 --> 01:50:11,247
I mean...

1195
01:50:11,497 --> 01:50:12,665
now it's come back a little.

1196
01:50:13,415 --> 01:50:14,375
{\an8}Right.

1197
01:50:16,085 --> 01:50:16,961
{\an8}Yeah.

1198
01:50:18,546 --> 01:50:19,672
{\an8}I told everyone about our

1199
01:50:19,755 --> 01:50:21,757
{\an8}little gypsy life together.

1200
01:50:22,925 --> 01:50:24,051
I miss it.

1201
01:50:24,593 --> 01:50:25,886
{\an8}We gotta get back into it.

1202
01:50:26,178 --> 01:50:27,847
{\an8}You know?
We gotta get back on it,

1203
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:29,265
{\an8}we gotta get back in the fuckin'...

1204
01:50:29,515 --> 01:50:30,683
{\an8}in the groove, huh?

1205
01:50:31,058 --> 01:50:31,851
{\an8}Don't you think?

1206
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:33,894
{\an8}I gotta go get the Airstream sorted.

1207
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:35,563
What do you mean sorted?

1208
01:50:35,688 --> 01:50:37,982
I just, I just got a shit ton
of things to do.

1209
01:50:38,107 --> 01:50:39,108
- You know?
- Right.

1210
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:40,151
Like with the tour and stuff?

1211
01:50:40,234 --> 01:50:41,527
- Yeah, the fuckin' tour, everything.
- Yeah.

1212
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:42,736
Like, we just gotta
get back on it,

1213
01:50:42,862 --> 01:50:43,654
- you know, everything,
- Mm-hmm.

1214
01:50:43,779 --> 01:50:44,864
the album, the tour...

1215
01:50:45,531 --> 01:50:47,199
...the, the...
...you know?

1216
01:50:49,451 --> 01:50:50,578
Yeah.

1217
01:50:56,834 --> 01:50:57,877
Hey.

1218
01:51:26,655 --> 01:51:27,907
It's okay, Lou.

1219
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:29,742
What?

1220
01:51:34,705 --> 01:51:35,789
It's okay.

1221
01:51:41,003 --> 01:51:42,087
What's okay?

1222
01:51:49,553 --> 01:51:51,180
You saved my life.

1223
01:51:54,225 --> 01:51:55,476
You made it...

1224
01:51:56,977 --> 01:51:58,604
you made it beautiful.

1225
01:52:02,525 --> 01:52:03,901
So it's okay.

1226
01:52:05,903 --> 01:52:07,238
What?

1227
01:52:08,614 --> 01:52:10,574
Why are you saying this?

1228
01:52:17,706 --> 01:52:19,625
You saved my life, too, Rubi.

1229
01:56:18,606 --> 01:56:23,606
