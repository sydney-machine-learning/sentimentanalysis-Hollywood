2
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:14,965
Hey!

3
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:01,339
We live in a twilight world.

4
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:05,343
We live in a twilight world.

5
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,379
And there are
no friends at dusk.

6
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:10,181
You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.

7
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:16,987
But I established contact.

8
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,757
Bring you in or kill you.

9
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:21,092
I have two minutes. Make up your mind.

10
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,265
Where's the package?

11
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,466
Coat check.

12
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:53,991
Stay.

13
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,919
No friends
at dusk, huh?

14
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:22,953
You'll do.

15
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,522
Get him to the rally point.

16
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,424
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

17
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,259
I've never seen encapsulation
like this.

18
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:03,661
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

19
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:04,696
Did you have an out?

20
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,564
Service tunnel to the sewer.

21
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,967
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

22
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,403
Can you defuse that?

23
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,804
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

24
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:14,372
Covering their tracks.

25
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,939
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

26
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:16,808
That's not our mission.

27
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,143
Mine now.

28
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:44,536
Walk away.

29
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,508
You don't have to
kill these people.

30
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,255
That wasn't one of us.

31
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,023
I'll take the help.

32
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:09,127
Go, go, go.

33
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:41,024
A man can be trained

34
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,060
to hold out
for about 18 hours,

35
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:46,264
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

36
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,138
He didn't last 18 minutes.

37
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,107
He didn't have anything
to hide.

38
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,610
You were smuggling a nobody.

39
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:03,381
It's risky.

40
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,920
Or were you counting on this?

41
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:10,421
Death.

42
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:12,423
CIA issue.

43
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:22,734
Spare yourself,
once they clear.

44
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,117
Almost 7:00.

45
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,552
Uh-oh.

46
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,392
It's running fast.

47
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,598
We have to put it back
one hour.

48
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:14,586
Get it out!

49
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:41,112
Welcome to the afterlife.

50
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,481
You've been in a
medically-induced coma

51
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:47,251
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

52
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,556
The suicide pills
are fake.

53
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:53,758
Why?

54
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,460
A test.

55
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:56,661
A test?

56
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,833
They pulled my teeth out.

57
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,637
Did my team get clear?

58
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:07,905
No.

59
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:09,907
Private Russians, we think.

60
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:12,844
Somebody talked.

61
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:15,413
Not you.

62
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,616
You chose to die instead of
giving up your colleagues.

63
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,396
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

64
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:35,767
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

65
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,201
You do.

66
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:44,742
I resign.

67
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,446
You don't work for us.
You're dead.

68
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,416
Your duty transcends
national interests.

69
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:53,484
This is about survival.

70
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:56,888
Whose?

71
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:00,825
Everyone's.

72
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:06,531
There's a cold war,
cold as ice.

73
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:10,268
To even know its true nature
is to lose.

74
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,969
This is knowledge divided.

75
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:15,606
All I have for you is a gesture

76
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:18,077
in combination with a word.

77
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,444
"Tenet."

78
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:23,881
Use it carefully.

79
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:27,251
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

80
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:29,454
That's all they've told you?

81
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,223
That test you passed?

82
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:34,959
Not everybody does.

83
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:52,697
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

84
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:54,465
Almost.

85
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,567
An obscure tenet.

86
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,677
No small talk.

87
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,880
Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.

88
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:11,716
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

89
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:14,452
You're not here for "what,"
you're here for "how."

90
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:17,688
"What" is your department
and not my business.

91
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,991
Well, to do what I do...

92
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,960
I need some idea
of the threat we face.

93
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,000
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent World War III.

94
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,801
Nuclear holocaust?

95
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,470
No.

96
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:35,539
Something worse.

97
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,017
Aim it and pull the trigger.

98
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:49,154
It's empty.

99
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:50,222
Aim it.

100
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,461
Check the magazine.

101
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:02,934
How?

102
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:12,610
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

103
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:15,414
The other one's
going backwards.

104
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,848
Can you tell which is which?

105
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,585
How about now?

106
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,389
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

107
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:27,326
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

108
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:30,795
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

109
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:31,862
You didn't make it?

110
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,365
No, we don't know how yet.

111
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:34,765
So, where'd it come from?

112
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,202
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

113
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,271
They're streaming back at us.

114
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,671
Try it.

115
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,680
You have to have dropped it.

116
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,561
How can it move
before I touch it?

117
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,997
From your point of view,
you caught it.

118
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,467
But from the bullet's point of
view, you dropped it.

119
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,202
But cause comes before effect.

120
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:13,472
No, that's just the way
we see time.

121
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,407
Well, what about free will?

122
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,842
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

123
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:21,012
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

124
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,015
Don't try to understand it.

125
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,617
Feel it.

126
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:38,130
Instinct.

127
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,032
Got it.

128
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,905
Why does it feel so strange?

129
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,243
You're not shooting the bullet,

130
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,810
you're catching it.

131
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:55,980
Whoa.

132
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:00,485
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

133
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,552
In the field?

134
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:02,820
I was almost hit.

135
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,223
Then you were
exceedingly lucky.

136
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,360
An inverted bullet passing through
your body would be devastating.

137
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,794
Not pretty.

138
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:12,963
These look like today's.

139
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,799
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

140
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,834
Where did you get them?

141
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:19,904
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

142
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,672
Do you have an analysis
on the metals?

143
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,607
Sure. Why?

144
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:26,211
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

145
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,778
Look...

146
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,781
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

147
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,820
The bullet may not seem like
much, but it's a simple machine.

148
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,956
Lead bullet, brass casing,
gunpowder.

149
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,293
If they can invert that,

150
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,060
I see no reason they couldn't
invert pretty much anything.

151
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,231
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

152
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,135
An inverted weapon might be
able to affect our past as well.

153
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:58,276
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

154
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:01,179
Remnants of complex objects.

155
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,016
What do you think we're seeing?

156
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,388
The detritus of a coming war.

157
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,409
- <i>Yep?</i>
- We live in a twilight world.

158
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:33,811
<i>No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.</i>

159
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:35,447
Even the dead need allies.

160
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,115
<i>Specifically?</i>

161
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,352
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

162
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:41,952
<i>Singh?</i>

163
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,721
<i>He never leaves his house.
And his house is...</i>

164
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:44,855
- <i>his house.</i>
- Yes, it is.

165
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,525
I'm looking right at it.

166
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:48,360
<i>I'll see who's on deck.</i>

167
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,428
<i>Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.</i>

168
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,008
It seems you need
an introduction

169
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:07,345
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

170
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,780
I'm Neil.

171
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,882
I need an audience
with Sanjay Singh.

172
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:15,320
That's not possible.

173
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,323
Ten minutes tops.

174
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,824
Time isn't the problem.

175
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,195
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

176
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,434
Would you take a child hostage?
A woman?

177
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,801
If I had to.

178
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:32,803
I'm not looking to make much
noise here.

179
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,871
Yes?

180
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:36,974
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

181
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:40,345
What?

182
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,480
You never drink on the job.

183
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,048
You're well-informed.

184
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:47,818
Well, pays to be
in our profession.

185
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:50,222
Well, I prefer soda water.

186
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,891
No, you don't.

187
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,760
How's your parachuting?

188
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,597
I broke an ankle
during basic training.

189
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:01,932
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

190
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,335
It's bungee-jumpable.

191
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,670
I don't think "bungee-jumpable"
is a word.

192
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:08,973
It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.

193
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:12,143
Or into it, for that matter.

194
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:54,119
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

195
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:58,650
Stay back.

196
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,820
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

197
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,855
I want to know who supplied it.

198
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:06,691
My name is Sanjay.

199
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,859
And you are?

200
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:10,795
No chitchat?

201
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,430
There's no one
at the other end.

202
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:14,099
No one who's gonna
help you, anyway.

203
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,901
Don't let it get cold.

204
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,573
Why should I know
who supplied it?

205
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:24,843
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

206
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,976
If it's from India,
it's from you.

207
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:27,846
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

208
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,514
Deduction, then.

209
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,116
Look, my friend...

210
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:34,152
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

211
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,821
I'm not the man they send
to negotiate.

212
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,023
Or the man they send
to make deals.

213
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,228
But I am the man
people talk to.

214
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:46,431
I can't.

215
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:47,632
I can't tell you.

216
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,234
You're an arms dealer, friend.

217
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,935
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

218
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:53,838
To say anything
about a client

219
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:56,907
would violate the tenets
he lives by.

220
00:21:56,974 --> 00:22:00,145
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

221
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:02,180
Everything.

222
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:05,350
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

223
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,986
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

224
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,655
<i>Cheers.</i>

225
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:12,791
- Priya.
- Hmm.

226
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:14,759
This is your operation?

227
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:18,163
A masculine front in
a man's world has its uses.

228
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:20,598
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.

229
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:21,833
The Russian oligarch.

230
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,868
- You know him?
- Not personally.

231
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:25,870
Made his billions in gas.

232
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:29,641
Moved to London. Said to be on
the outs with Moscow.

233
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,476
Very good.

234
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:34,512
Except the gas he made his billions
from was actually plutonium.

235
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:38,416
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

236
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,018
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

237
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,455
So how did he
get them inverted?

238
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,357
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

239
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:48,626
Between our time
and the future.

240
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,796
He can communicate
with the future?

241
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:53,331
We all do, don't we?

242
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:55,233
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

243
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,270
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

244
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:03,308
The question is,
can the future speak back?

245
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:05,677
And I'm supposed to find out?

246
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:09,948
To get anywhere near Sator would
take a fresh-faced protagonist.

247
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,684
And you are fresh as a daisy.

248
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,918
Get close.

249
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:16,254
Find out what he's receiving
and how.

250
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:18,289
Is it safe to involve
British Intelligence?

251
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,991
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.

252
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,267
You must've had a plan for
getting out.

253
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,035
Not one I love.

254
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:56,861
May I help you, sir?

255
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,363
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

256
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,132
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

257
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,333
Presume away.

258
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,168
If you'll follow me.

259
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,109
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

260
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,111
I'll catch up.

261
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,045
Same for me, please.

262
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:16,214
I'll send the waiter.

263
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,683
No, just pass on the order.

264
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,586
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

265
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:24,589
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.

266
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:27,425
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

267
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:30,762
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

268
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,096
but they don't seem to care.

269
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:33,798
Tell me about him.

270
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:37,335
I assume you're familiar with
the Soviet-era secret cities.

271
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:41,306
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

272
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:44,909
Most of them have been opened
up and renamed as regular towns.

273
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:46,778
Not the one Sator grew up in.

274
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:48,379
Stalsk-12.

275
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,249
In the '70s,
it had a population of about 200,000.

276
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,650
Thought to be abandoned.

277
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,419
Abandoned?

278
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:57,889
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

279
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,692
Two weeks ago, same day as the
Kiev opera siege,

280
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:04,062
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

281
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,464
just where Stalsk-12 was.

282
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:09,968
Sator emerged from
this blank spot on the map

283
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,869
with ambition...

284
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,106
and enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.

285
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,641
Through his wife?

286
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,277
Katherine Barton. Oldest niece
of Sir Frederick Barton.

287
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,746
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.

288
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:22,780
A happy marriage?

289
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:24,949
Practically estranged.

290
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,117
Well, how do I get to Sator?

291
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:27,752
Well, through her, of course.

292
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,388
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

293
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:32,123
Hardly.

294
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,193
We have an ace in the hole.

295
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,298
You're carrying a Goya
in a Harrods bag.

296
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:43,001
It's a fake by a Spaniard
named Arepo.

297
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,337
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

298
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:48,039
What happened to the other one?

299
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:50,908
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

300
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:52,310
Put on auction.

301
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,045
And who do you think bought it?

302
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:55,114
Her husband?

303
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,414
Mmm-hmm.

304
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:59,450
Does she know it's a forgery?

305
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,752
Oh, it's hard to say.

306
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:04,989
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.

307
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:06,357
Uh-huh.

308
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:09,193
Look, no offense,

309
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,197
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

310
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:16,634
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

311
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,403
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

312
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:21,205
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

313
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,641
Can I recommend a tailor?

314
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,009
I'll manage.

315
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,211
You British don't have a
monopoly on snobbery, you know.

316
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,546
Well, not a monopoly.

317
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:30,782
More of a controlling interest.

318
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,818
Could you box that up for me?

319
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:34,986
Certainly not.

320
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:38,256
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

321
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:12,323
How can I help, sir?

322
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,663
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

323
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,731
Goya.

324
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,400
Mr. Goya.

325
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,702
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.

326
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,706
That's extraordinary.

327
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:35,379
What's it worth?

328
00:27:36,414 --> 00:27:38,316
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

329
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:42,520
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

330
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:47,558
Provenance, microscopic
examination, X-rays.

331
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,894
But what does
your heart tell you?

332
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,833
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

333
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:58,035
Tomas Arepo.

334
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:04,909
I bought my Goya for cents on a
dollar from an irate Swiss banker.

335
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,879
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

336
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:10,782
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

337
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:13,252
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

338
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,452
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

339
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,255
My drawing's a very good fake.

340
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,722
You know that
better than anyone.

341
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:19,724
The information's the bargain.

342
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:23,228
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

343
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:26,564
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

344
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,133
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

345
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,500
Arrangement?

346
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,103
You mean blackmail.

347
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,470
Don't be afraid of the word.

348
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:34,605
My husband isn't.

349
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,474
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

350
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,509
He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?

351
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:39,710
Why would he?

352
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:41,379
He paid $9 million for it.

353
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:43,948
Barely cover the cost of the
holiday he just forced us on.

354
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,583
Where'd you go, Mars?

355
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:50,388
Vietnam, on our yacht.
His yacht.

356
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:53,825
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

357
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:56,627
Think you're a little
out of your depth.

358
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,897
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

359
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:03,835
generally aren't okay with
being cheated out of any of it.

360
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:11,709
The drawing is his hold
over me.

361
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:20,852
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

362
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:24,755
He controls me.

363
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:27,491
My contact with my son.
Everything.

364
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,129
Leaving would never have been
easy but now it's impossible.

365
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,565
You can't fight.

366
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,102
Just beg.

367
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:41,240
In Vietnam,
I tried to love him again.

368
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:44,709
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

369
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:48,946
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

370
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,449
<i>imitating some earlier time
in our lives.</i>

371
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,485
He seemed happy,
so I asked him.

372
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:56,587
<i>And he made me an offer.</i>

373
00:29:56,654 --> 00:29:59,523
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

374
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:06,365
I expressed myself.
I took Max ashore.

375
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,167
He called us, contrite.

376
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:10,801
And when we got back,

377
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:12,204
<i>I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,</i>

378
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,804
and he'd vanished.

379
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:18,609
I never felt such envy.

380
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:20,178
You don't seem
the jealous type.

381
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:21,846
Of her freedom.

382
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,220
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

383
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,720
But you share a son.

384
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:32,823
That's my life now.

385
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,926
Did you know the drawing
was a fake?

386
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:35,993
No.

387
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,529
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.

388
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:39,931
I failed.

389
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:42,466
Andrei can't conceive of
failure, only betrayal.

390
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,136
But I didn't betray my husband.

391
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:46,804
Retrospect, maybe I missed
my chance.

392
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,673
And he let Arepo walk free.

393
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,775
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,

394
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:53,511
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

395
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:54,745
We spoke on the phone.

396
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,981
He can't do that either.

397
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,151
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

398
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,685
Get me an introduction.

399
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:02,387
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

400
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:05,823
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

401
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,126
I might just be
your second chance.

402
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:10,061
No, I don't need redemption.

403
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:11,595
At betrayal.

404
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:18,669
Friends of your husband's?

405
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,072
You knew this was
going to happen?

406
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:23,375
Don't worry,
they won't kill you.

407
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:26,711
Andrei dislikes tangling with local
law enforcement on that level.

408
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:29,147
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

409
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:31,149
The look of you's fine.

410
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:34,453
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

411
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,088
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

412
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:37,588
Don't call from home.

413
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:40,858
You won't be taking my call.

414
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:45,330
I might surprise you.

415
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,862
I ordered my hot sauce
an hour ago.

416
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,966
Can we get going?

417
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,349
Please?

418
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,816
He wants you to see.

419
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:07,112
And he gets what he wants.

420
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:15,753
Not always, apparently.

421
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,428
<i>Anna says we're going
to Pompeii</i>

422
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:24,662
and see lava.

423
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:26,831
We will.
We'll go together.

424
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,799
I'll be there, too!

425
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,054
Told you I'd surprise you.

426
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:52,723
He's a cute kid.

427
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,991
He's everything.

428
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:57,928
Where's the drawing?

429
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,132
Oslo. At the airport.

430
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:01,600
The airport?

431
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,934
Do you know what a Freeport is?

432
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,538
<i>A storage facility
for art that was acquired...</i>

433
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:08,706
<i>But not yet taxed.</i>

434
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,908
<i>We started a network.</i>

435
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:14,579
<i>Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.</i>

436
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:16,747
<i>The facilities are tax havens.</i>

437
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:19,284
<i>The clients can view their
investments without importing them,</i>

438
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,620
so they avoid paying tax.

439
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,054
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

440
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:25,689
<i>Art, antiquities.</i>

441
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:27,691
- <i>Anything of value, really.</i>
- <i>Anything?</i>

442
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,327
Anything legal.

443
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,563
But it's not unlike
the Swiss banking system.

444
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,366
Opaque.

445
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:38,068
As I'm sure you are aware,
most Freeports are just warehouses.

446
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:40,738
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

447
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:43,441
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

448
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:45,577
And this way to the vaults!

449
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,312
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

450
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,747
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

451
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:52,284
- To view art?
- And whatever it is he does.

452
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,785
Turns out art's
of no importance to Andrei.

453
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,687
But the Freeports are.

454
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:00,192
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

455
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:03,094
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

456
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:05,930
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

457
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,845
Some of our clients opt for
biometric access, straight in...

458
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,683
off the tarmac.

459
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,016
From the terminal?

460
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,819
From their private planes.

461
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:30,955
Of course.

462
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,724
Our logistics department
ships to and from

463
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:34,925
any other Freeport in the world

464
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:37,027
without customs inspection.

465
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,929
<i>What are you hoping
to find in there?</i>

466
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:40,098
You really wanna know?

467
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:42,032
I'm not sure.

468
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,469
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

469
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:45,936
Jesus.

470
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:47,405
It's nuclear.

471
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:49,341
When you're on the tour,

472
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,942
<i>pay attention
to the fire precautions.</i>

473
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:54,346
Documents are
vulnerable to...

474
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:55,946
Fire? Absolutely!

475
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,048
No, I was going to say water
damage from the sprinkler systems.

476
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,218
We don't use sprinklers.

477
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,053
The facility is flooded
with halide gas,

478
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,290
displacing all the air
within seconds.

479
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:07,626
Can you show me?

480
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:09,760
If I did, we'd suffocate.

481
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:12,130
What about the staff?

482
00:36:12,197 --> 00:36:13,831
Halide only fills the vaults,

483
00:36:13,897 --> 00:36:15,734
they just have to get
into either corridor,

484
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,801
and there is
a 10-second warning.

485
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:19,803
At least you give them
10 seconds.

486
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,676
Well, sir, our clients
use us because we have no priorities

487
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:26,411
above their property.

488
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,345
Blimey.

489
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:28,680
All doors are fireproof.

490
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:31,815
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

491
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,718
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

492
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:35,253
Why a lockdown?

493
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,022
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

494
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:40,958
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

495
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,027
And pickable locks.

496
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,462
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

497
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:45,630
Child's play?

498
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:47,198
They're inside
airport security.

499
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:49,833
They have to worry about climate
control, not armed raids.

500
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,903
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

501
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,838
to trigger
the lockdown procedure?

502
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:57,975
Back wall of the Freeport.

503
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,344
You've got something?

504
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:02,447
Not gonna like it.

505
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,249
You wanna crash a plane?

506
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:06,785
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

507
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,354
I want to run a jet
off the taxiway

508
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:12,056
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

509
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,993
Well, how big a plane?

510
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,131
Well, that part
is a little dramatic.

511
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:22,933
This is Mahir.

512
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,102
His team'll work the plane.

513
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:25,537
There can't be passengers.

514
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:27,105
Norsk Freight.

515
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,441
They use the hangar on
the west side of the Freeport.

516
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:31,909
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

517
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,678
We pop the slides,
chuck 'em off.

518
00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:35,012
On the move?

519
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,880
What's the problem?
They'll be fine.

520
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,351
Well, it seems bold.

521
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,220
Bold I'm fine with. I thought
you were gonna say nuts.

522
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:43,555
And if you
get caught?

523
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:44,589
We won't.

524
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:46,424
And if you do?

525
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:48,626
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

526
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:51,895
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

527
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:53,598
It'll barely make the news.

528
00:37:53,665 --> 00:37:56,167
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

529
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,670
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

530
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,138
Gold bars?

531
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:02,107
Norsk Freight ships Treasury
gold once a month.

532
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:05,543
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

533
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,314
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

534
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:14,486
The space in the
center of the pentagon is too big.

535
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:16,254
There's something there.

536
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:19,357
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

537
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:21,959
That's 45 seconds.

538
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:23,094
Ample.

539
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:24,529
Won't you be running?

540
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:27,599
All right, it's your turn.

541
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:28,966
Start packing.

542
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:48,051
Gentlemen, if you
would, through the detector, please.

543
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,391
Sir?

544
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,826
Oh.

545
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:56,026
And, sir.

546
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:07,004
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

547
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,740
No,
I'll take an espresso.

548
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,608
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

549
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,310
Excellent.

550
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,020
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

551
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:25,290
Because all I got here
is vegetarian.

552
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,494
So that looks like meat,

553
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:32,163
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

554
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,566
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

555
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,301
Okay.

556
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:45,042
This way, gentlemen.

557
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,194
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

558
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:16,107
Carry on. Not the radio.

559
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:24,115
Let's go.

560
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:41,766
Uh...

561
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:55,446
Yoga.

562
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,420
Let's go! Now!

563
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:33,851
Go, go, go!

564
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,656
Right. Um...

565
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,505
You said 10 seconds, right?

566
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:50,421
There's
someone in here with us.

567
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,405
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

568
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:36,667
Don't touch them!

569
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:38,836
The hell happened here?

570
00:44:44,342 --> 00:44:46,344
It hasn't happened yet.

571
00:47:05,384 --> 00:47:07,152
Don't kill him!

572
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:09,820
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

573
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:14,025
Why are you here?

574
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,194
Who are you?

575
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:18,163
How'd you know we'd be here?

576
00:47:33,577 --> 00:47:35,479
We need to go.

577
00:47:40,419 --> 00:47:42,853
What happened to the other guy?

578
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,190
Took care of him.

579
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:01,406
Well,
I've seen too much.

580
00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:04,109
I'm still alive, which must
mean you've decided to trust me.

581
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:05,810
Or maybe I lost my edge.

582
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:07,878
Edge is still intact.

583
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:11,515
There's a cold war.

584
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,118
Nuclear?

585
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:14,419
Temporal.

586
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:16,887
Time travel?

587
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,156
No.

588
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:21,159
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

589
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,061
You mean reverse chronology.

590
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:26,398
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

591
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:27,698
moving backwards in time?

592
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:29,468
Sure, that's exactly
what I meant.

593
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,136
I have a master's in physics.

594
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:32,536
Well, try and keep up.

595
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:34,239
The implications of this are...

596
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:35,340
Beyond secret.

597
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:37,041
Then why'd you bring me in?

598
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:39,510
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

599
00:48:39,577 --> 00:48:41,146
Not as surprised as I was.

600
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:45,049
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

601
00:48:45,117 --> 00:48:48,652
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

602
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:51,989
it's all about plutonium.

603
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:53,591
And when we're done,
they'll kill you.

604
00:48:53,657 --> 00:48:56,527
Won't you have to
do that anyway?

605
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:58,363
I'd rather it be my decision.

606
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,297
So would I.

607
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:01,266
I think.

608
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:14,179
Your work?

609
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,549
What did you find
in the vaults?

610
00:49:18,616 --> 00:49:21,420
Two antagonists. One inverted.

611
00:49:21,486 --> 00:49:25,524
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

612
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:27,125
Both emerged
at the same moment?

613
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:28,692
Yeah.

614
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:30,061
They were the same person.

615
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:33,465
Sator's built a turnstile
in that vault.

616
00:49:33,532 --> 00:49:34,799
Turnstile?

617
00:49:34,865 --> 00:49:37,235
A machine for inverting.

618
00:49:37,302 --> 00:49:40,272
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

619
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:41,506
It hasn't.

620
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:42,873
He's been given it
by the future.

621
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,342
For what?

622
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:46,944
You have the best chance of
finding out.

623
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:49,880
- <i>Have you met him?</i>
- <i>I was close.</i>

624
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:52,317
What if you have
something he needs?

625
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:53,751
Such as?

626
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:55,986
Plutonium-241.

627
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:59,357
Sator tried to lift the only
loose 241 from under a CIA team

628
00:49:59,424 --> 00:50:01,992
at the opera siege in Kiev.

629
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:03,428
He got the team.

630
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:04,595
Not the 241.

631
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:05,629
Who did?

632
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:07,898
Ukrainian Security Services.

633
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:10,235
It's moving to Tallinn
in a week.

634
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:13,371
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

635
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:15,906
is unacceptable, Priya.

636
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:17,476
I'm just gonna take him out.

637
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,610
No, no, no.
Sator has to stay alive.

638
00:50:19,677 --> 00:50:22,646
He has to stay alive until
we know his part in things.

639
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,116
Leverage the situation,

640
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:26,451
without losing control
of the 241.

641
00:50:26,518 --> 00:50:28,086
It's too dangerous.

642
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:30,322
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

643
00:50:30,388 --> 00:50:33,358
is nothing compared with what will
happen if we don't stop Sator.

644
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:34,959
From doing what?

645
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:38,929
We are being attacked
by the future.

646
00:50:40,098 --> 00:50:43,168
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

647
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:01,286
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

648
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,355
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

649
00:51:03,421 --> 00:51:05,323
You destroyed it?

650
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,492
I didn't think
you'd want it back.

651
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,593
Does he know?

652
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:10,262
Not yet. So sit tight.

653
00:51:10,328 --> 00:51:12,097
Sit tight?

654
00:51:12,164 --> 00:51:14,232
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

655
00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:15,400
It won't be long.

656
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:18,103
In the meantime, introduce me.

657
00:51:18,603 --> 00:51:20,372
As what?

658
00:51:20,438 --> 00:51:22,507
I'm a former first secretary from
the American Embassy in Riyadh.

659
00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:24,342
We met at a party last June.

660
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:26,010
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

661
00:51:26,076 --> 00:51:28,413
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

662
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,283
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

663
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:33,185
Sator left early.
That's when we met.

664
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:34,852
I came into Shipley's
in London.

665
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:36,588
You ran into me here

666
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:38,190
and wanna show me your yacht.

667
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:40,625
He'll think we're
having an affair.

668
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:41,759
Then he'll wanna meet me.

669
00:51:41,825 --> 00:51:42,860
Or have you killed.

670
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:45,397
Let me worry about that.

671
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:47,064
Did I look worried?

672
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:49,900
Sleeps 70 with crew.

673
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:52,637
Two helicopters.
Missile defenses.

674
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,172
Afraid of pirates?

675
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,774
Andrei lives playing
one government off the other.

676
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,610
The day they turn,
that's his refuge.

677
00:51:58,677 --> 00:51:59,977
May I join you?

678
00:52:00,044 --> 00:52:02,547
Not sure Volkov's taking
passengers just now.

679
00:52:02,614 --> 00:52:04,349
Then we'll take mine.

680
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:39,317
Max!

681
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:43,088
Who's the American?

682
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:45,756
He's a friend.

683
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:48,660
The man from Shipley's.

684
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:51,129
Who you tried to have
beaten up.

685
00:52:52,029 --> 00:52:54,532
I ask again, who is he?

686
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:59,770
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

687
00:52:59,837 --> 00:53:02,240
Good with fists for a diplomat.

688
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:04,376
Paranoia's your department,
Andrei.

689
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:07,811
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

690
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:09,080
Max?

691
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:12,450
He's visiting Pompeii
and Herculaneum.

692
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:14,051
You just sent him off?

693
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:16,755
I promised him I'd go with him.

694
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,023
I explained you were busy.

695
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:22,926
With your friend.

696
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:45,816
Hey, easy, fella.

697
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:48,253
Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.

698
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,266
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

699
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,170
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

700
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:07,372
Uh... No.

701
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:09,374
Not yet.

702
00:54:10,675 --> 00:54:12,477
How would you like to die?

703
00:54:13,244 --> 00:54:14,112
Old.

704
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:16,914
You chose the wrong profession.

705
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:20,352
There's a walled garden
up the road.

706
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:22,886
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

707
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:26,157
Not across. In the middle,
like a hole.

708
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:28,992
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

709
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:30,628
block the windpipe.

710
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:32,564
Complex.

711
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,965
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

712
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:39,137
try to pull his own balls out
of his throat before he chokes.

713
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,839
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

714
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:42,474
We're finished.

715
00:54:46,511 --> 00:54:47,512
Do you like opera?

716
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:55,553
Well?

717
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,987
Not here.

718
00:55:00,392 --> 00:55:01,159
You sail?

719
00:55:01,226 --> 00:55:02,761
I've messed around on boats.

720
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:05,630
Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to
do more than mess around.

721
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:07,265
8:00 a.m.

722
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:24,047
<i>Max has missed
too much school this year.</i>

723
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:25,750
I'm taking him back to England.

724
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:27,085
The school won't be okay with
him missing so much of the term.

725
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:30,020
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

726
00:55:30,088 --> 00:55:31,890
You have all the trappings
of a king.

727
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:34,526
We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games

728
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:36,628
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

729
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:39,364
You seem...

730
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:42,300
spirited today.

731
00:55:43,835 --> 00:55:46,337
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

732
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:54,712
Were you worried
it had been destroyed?

733
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:59,117
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

734
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:01,719
I've always had instincts
about the future.

735
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:06,558
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

736
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:23,441
Sailing or diving?

737
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:42,093
Rising!

738
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:09,052
What do you know about opera?

739
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,223
In 2008, a remote
Russian missile station

740
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,025
was overwhelmed
and held for a week.

741
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:16,761
When the station was retaken,

742
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:20,765
241 on one warhead was three
quarters of a kilo lighter.

743
00:57:24,836 --> 00:57:26,704
The missing 241

744
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:29,974
surfaced at the opera house
siege in Kiev on the 14th.

745
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,042
Coming about!

746
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:52,263
What do you propose?

747
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:54,032
Partnership.

748
00:57:54,098 --> 00:57:55,967
I wouldn't partner with you.

749
00:57:56,034 --> 00:58:00,305
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

750
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:02,507
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

751
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:04,309
who knows how to
cover his tracks.

752
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,710
Not that shocking.

753
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,046
For an intelligence agent.

754
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:10,148
Right!

755
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,285
Burn in hell, Andrei.

756
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:23,328
You can't jibe
a boat like this!

757
00:58:23,394 --> 00:58:24,796
You can if you have to.

758
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,559
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

759
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:56,127
I need him.

760
00:58:56,194 --> 00:58:57,295
What, to sell guns?

761
00:58:57,362 --> 00:58:58,630
I'm not who you think I am.

762
00:58:58,696 --> 00:58:59,831
Well, that I know.

763
00:58:59,897 --> 00:59:02,433
He showed me the drawing.

764
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,869
I'm sorry.
I had to get close to him.

765
00:59:04,936 --> 00:59:07,038
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

766
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:09,774
Oh, we both know
he's an arms dealer.

767
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:11,242
He's so much more.

768
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:13,144
What, then?

769
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:16,347
Andrei Sator holds all of our
lives in his hands, not just yours.

770
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:25,990
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

771
00:59:26,057 --> 00:59:26,924
Okay.

772
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:29,527
Now.

773
00:59:29,594 --> 00:59:31,796
Uh, he wants to see me
without pants?

774
00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:39,504
- Trust me.
- Save it.

775
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,839
I'm not falling for it twice.

776
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:45,510
You have a better option?

777
00:59:48,312 --> 00:59:50,281
Whatever it takes
to get what you want.

778
00:59:50,348 --> 00:59:52,950
Not a second's thought
for me or my son.

779
00:59:57,455 --> 00:59:59,757
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

780
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:12,770
Try not to use it.

781
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:16,641
On anyone.

782
01:00:21,879 --> 01:00:23,281
Enough.

783
01:00:26,684 --> 01:00:29,721
See? Pulse of a man
half my age.

784
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,625
Drink with me.

785
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:38,896
It seems I now owe you my life.

786
01:00:38,963 --> 01:00:40,031
It's nothing.

787
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:42,134
My life is not nothing.

788
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:44,836
And I don't like to be in debt.

789
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:46,604
Then pay me.

790
01:00:46,671 --> 01:00:48,906
No retribution
against your wife.

791
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:54,612
You think she released
my harness?

792
01:00:57,982 --> 01:01:00,284
It was my own mistake.

793
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:02,353
Then help me steal the 241.

794
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,689
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

795
01:01:04,756 --> 01:01:06,824
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

796
01:01:06,891 --> 01:01:08,426
I know what it means.

797
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:13,698
You lecture me about radiation?

798
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:16,334
Andrei Sator,

799
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,272
digging plutonium from the
rubble of my city as a teenager.

800
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:22,406
Where?

801
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:26,978
<i>Stalsk-12.</i>

802
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:29,580
<i>My home.</i>

803
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:36,854
One part of a warhead exploded at
ground level, scattering the others.

804
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:41,292
They needed people
to find the plutonium.

805
01:01:43,228 --> 01:01:45,197
It became my first contract.

806
01:01:45,264 --> 01:01:48,566
<i>Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.</i>

807
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:52,603
But...

808
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:57,074
<i>one man's probability
of death...</i>

809
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:03,347
...is another man's possibility
for a life.

810
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:08,920
<i>I staked my claim
in the new Russia.</i>

811
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:13,791
Even now, my company is the only
one to operate in the ruins.

812
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:16,928
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

813
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:22,433
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

814
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,869
I'm told you have resources
in Tallinn.

815
01:02:29,574 --> 01:02:31,976
Stay with us tonight.

816
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:33,744
I insist.

817
01:03:01,106 --> 01:03:02,274
What do you want?

818
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:04,542
We're going to talk
about today.

819
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,377
No, we're not.

820
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:07,645
No?

821
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:10,848
We'll see.

822
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:12,550
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

823
01:03:12,617 --> 01:03:14,685
like you treat
your other women.

824
01:03:16,554 --> 01:03:18,689
And, uh...

825
01:03:19,557 --> 01:03:22,460
how do you imagine...

826
01:03:22,526 --> 01:03:23,961
I treat these other women, huh?

827
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:26,664
You think I force them
into conversation?

828
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:28,300
You wanna be quiet, fine.

829
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:30,067
You can bite down on that.

830
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,707
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

831
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:40,245
Is fear and pain
enough, Andrei?

832
01:03:40,312 --> 01:03:41,545
That's all I have to offer you.

833
01:03:41,612 --> 01:03:43,282
Well, that will
have to do, then.

834
01:03:43,348 --> 01:03:46,118
Why didn't you just let me go?

835
01:03:46,184 --> 01:03:48,186
Because...

836
01:03:50,188 --> 01:03:54,892
if I can't have you...

837
01:03:56,361 --> 01:03:59,997
no one else can.

838
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:02,934
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

839
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,902
You think I let him interfere?

840
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:07,838
If he tried,
you'd have to kill him.

841
01:04:07,905 --> 01:04:08,940
End of deal.

842
01:04:10,508 --> 01:04:12,910
So you leave me alone.

843
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:16,447
Not now!

844
01:06:36,053 --> 01:06:40,325
Ninety-eight.
Not bad for such exertion.

845
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:53,105
He was at the window.

846
01:06:54,738 --> 01:06:56,108
I was curious.

847
01:06:57,209 --> 01:07:00,378
My property
shouldn't concern you.

848
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:01,979
Who are you?

849
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:04,048
How do you come by your
information about the opera?

850
01:07:04,116 --> 01:07:08,520
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

851
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:12,056
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

852
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:15,693
They're usually buying,
not selling.

853
01:07:15,759 --> 01:07:18,497
But we do live
in a twilight world.

854
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:20,098
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

855
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:22,134
Next warning's a bullet
in the brain.

856
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:26,804
No balls in my throat?

857
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:29,474
There will be no time
for such things...

858
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:31,041
in Tallinn.

859
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:35,080
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

860
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:36,348
No.

861
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:42,853
I spring the material.
You pay me off.

862
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,655
Your wife does the exchange.

863
01:07:44,722 --> 01:07:45,990
I never involve her
in my business.

864
01:07:46,056 --> 01:07:48,293
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

865
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,095
Put him ashore.

866
01:07:50,162 --> 01:07:51,563
How do I
contact you?

867
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:52,796
You don't.

868
01:07:52,863 --> 01:07:54,366
How do you advance me
the funds?

869
01:07:58,068 --> 01:08:01,273
Handle the plutonium
better than that.

870
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:12,716
<i>What did you find on the gold?</i>

871
01:08:12,783 --> 01:08:14,619
<i>No franks,
no mold marks. Nothing.</i>

872
01:08:14,685 --> 01:08:17,021
- How?
- Dead drops.

873
01:08:17,088 --> 01:08:20,158
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

874
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,794
then digs it up to collect the
inverted materials they sent.

875
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:26,797
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

876
01:08:26,864 --> 01:08:29,900
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

877
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,036
What did the soil samples show?

878
01:08:32,103 --> 01:08:34,439
Northern Europe, Asia.

879
01:08:34,506 --> 01:08:35,973
<i>Radioactive.</i>

880
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,876
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

881
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:40,945
Why am I here?

882
01:08:41,011 --> 01:08:44,416
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

883
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:47,152
<i>Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?</i>

884
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:50,088
Crowded. Unpredictable
traffic patterns.

885
01:08:50,155 --> 01:08:52,490
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

886
01:08:52,557 --> 01:08:54,758
They have a point.

887
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:56,328
Is the convoy monitored
from the air?

888
01:08:56,394 --> 01:09:00,064
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
in come the cavalry.

889
01:09:00,131 --> 01:09:01,433
<i>We need big guns.</i>

890
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:03,702
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

891
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:07,339
We need a fast car that doesn't
look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

892
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:08,973
All different.

893
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,009
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

894
01:09:12,076 --> 01:09:15,380
Most of all, we have to set this
up with nothing in the record.

895
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:17,415
Nothing electronic,
nothing paper.

896
01:09:17,482 --> 01:09:21,852
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

897
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:24,955
His ignorance is our only
protection.

898
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:03,495
You see, Kat?

899
01:10:04,462 --> 01:10:06,864
Some of my favorites.

900
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:12,836
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

901
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:15,573
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

902
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,010
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

903
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:22,714
But this is where
our worlds collide.

904
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:24,316
What is this, Andrei?

905
01:10:24,382 --> 01:10:27,585
You know perfectly well
what it is, Kat.

906
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:32,223
The filthy business

907
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:35,593
that put those clothes on your
back and our boy in his school,

908
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,196
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

909
01:10:47,971 --> 01:10:49,274
Time to go.

910
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:50,874
I'm not going anywhere
with him.

911
01:10:50,941 --> 01:10:52,076
Look at me!

912
01:10:53,611 --> 01:10:55,814
And understand,

913
01:10:55,879 --> 01:10:58,383
you don't negotiate
with a tiger.

914
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:02,520
You admire a tiger
until he turns on you

915
01:11:02,587 --> 01:11:06,957
and you feel its true
fucking nature!

916
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:08,959
Don't.

917
01:11:09,794 --> 01:11:12,029
You stay right there.

918
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,802
Green. Two minutes.

919
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:42,727
You are not going to kill me.

920
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:44,662
I already tried.

921
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:46,097
You pushed me off a boat.

922
01:11:46,164 --> 01:11:48,166
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

923
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:50,535
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

924
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:54,071
No, but you're not
angry enough.

925
01:11:55,507 --> 01:11:59,210
Because anger scars over
into despair.

926
01:12:01,078 --> 01:12:03,448
I look in your eyes...

927
01:12:04,849 --> 01:12:06,551
I see despair.

928
01:12:10,355 --> 01:12:13,658
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!

929
01:12:13,725 --> 01:12:15,393
Thinking that you're better!

930
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,528
Enough!

931
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:43,621
Tell me everything
as it happens.

932
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:47,991
Seal me this side.

933
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:07,579
Yellow, 60 seconds.

934
01:13:07,645 --> 01:13:09,280
60. Check.

935
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:26,664
Blue, 45 seconds.

936
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:28,433
Blue, 45, check.

937
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:47,385
Okay, Red.
Coming to you.

938
01:14:02,433 --> 01:14:05,336
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

939
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:51,816
All right, everyone set?

940
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:59,691
And five...

941
01:15:00,592 --> 01:15:02,126
four...

942
01:15:02,894 --> 01:15:03,861
three...

943
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,164
two...

944
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:09,300
<i>one.</i>

945
01:15:31,856 --> 01:15:32,890
Go, Yellow!

946
01:15:36,661 --> 01:15:38,029
We got a problem!

947
01:15:38,097 --> 01:15:40,898
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

948
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,293
Check the
radio chatter.

949
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:08,479
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

950
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:10,149
This is not one of them.

951
01:18:10,215 --> 01:18:11,883
That's what he's after.

952
01:18:15,486 --> 01:18:16,687
Can't understand this.

953
01:18:16,754 --> 01:18:18,356
You said you spoke Estonian.

954
01:18:18,422 --> 01:18:20,024
It's not Estonian.

955
01:18:20,092 --> 01:18:21,359
It's backwards.

956
01:18:26,497 --> 01:18:27,899
The hell is that?

957
01:18:43,148 --> 01:18:44,615
Go, go, go!

958
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:33,030
Don't give it to him.

959
01:19:33,098 --> 01:19:34,299
This isn't plutonium.

960
01:19:34,365 --> 01:19:35,733
It's worse than that,
God damn it!

961
01:19:54,353 --> 01:19:55,586
Sorry.

962
01:20:11,535 --> 01:20:12,703
He's getting away.

963
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:15,673
He left her
in the car!

964
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:18,176
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

965
01:20:31,555 --> 01:20:32,924
Pull up alongside!

966
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:51,008
Come on, come on. Closer!

967
01:20:54,712 --> 01:20:56,514
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

968
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:00,085
Hurry up!

969
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:02,820
Please!

970
01:21:38,856 --> 01:21:41,726
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

971
01:21:42,493 --> 01:21:43,928
What cavalry?

972
01:22:48,025 --> 01:22:50,295
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

973
01:22:52,863 --> 01:22:54,332
I don't know what you're
talkin' about.

974
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:56,734
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

975
01:22:58,803 --> 01:23:00,439
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

976
01:23:00,505 --> 01:23:01,772
is it really in the BMW?

977
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:04,142
I don't know.

978
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:05,576
Tell me or
I'll shoot her again!

979
01:23:07,479 --> 01:23:08,547
Leave her alone!

980
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:09,980
Kill him!

981
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:11,916
I don't have time
to negotiate.

982
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,756
- Listen to me!
- Three.

983
01:23:18,823 --> 01:23:19,824
I can help you.

984
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,326
- Help me!
- Two.

985
01:23:21,393 --> 01:23:22,427
Please!

986
01:23:22,494 --> 01:23:23,727
- Don't!
- One.

987
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:29,534
Next one's a bullet
to the head.

988
01:23:31,236 --> 01:23:32,703
- No!
- One.

989
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:34,473
Two. Three.

990
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,873
Okay! Okay.

991
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,742
The car. The BMW.

992
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:40,145
I left it in the BMW.

993
01:23:40,212 --> 01:23:41,379
We're going to check
this is real.

994
01:23:43,981 --> 01:23:46,050
It's in the glove box!

995
01:23:46,118 --> 01:23:48,120
Where did you leave it?

996
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:50,921
Car or fire truck, which one?

997
01:23:50,988 --> 01:23:53,691
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

998
01:23:53,757 --> 01:23:54,859
I already told you.

999
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:57,395
I believe you.

1000
01:23:57,462 --> 01:23:59,663
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

1001
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:13,644
Clear!

1002
01:24:13,711 --> 01:24:15,413
Wheeler, go check
the other side.

1003
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,747
You two.

1004
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:18,083
Where did he go?

1005
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,151
The past.

1006
01:24:42,107 --> 01:24:43,475
It's in
the glove box!

1007
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:46,478
We're going to check
this is real.

1008
01:24:49,114 --> 01:24:51,616
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

1009
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:53,485
Next one's a bullet to the head.

1010
01:24:54,852 --> 01:24:57,122
- No! No!
- One.

1011
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:59,124
- Listen to me.
- Two.

1012
01:24:59,191 --> 01:25:00,292
Three.

1013
01:25:00,358 --> 01:25:01,959
I can help you.

1014
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:04,061
I don't have time to negotiate.

1015
01:25:04,129 --> 01:25:05,463
Tell me
or I'll shoot her again.

1016
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:08,400
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

1017
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:09,700
is it really in the BMW?

1018
01:25:09,767 --> 01:25:11,236
I don't know.

1019
01:25:11,303 --> 01:25:13,737
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

1020
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:15,373
Who told you that?

1021
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,442
If you're not telling
the truth, she dies.

1022
01:25:17,509 --> 01:25:19,710
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1023
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:33,258
- Medic!
- Check in.

1024
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:36,328
She's been shot?

1025
01:25:36,394 --> 01:25:38,263
Bring her back,
this side.

1026
01:25:39,698 --> 01:25:41,399
Was she shot with
an inverted round?

1027
01:25:46,804 --> 01:25:48,973
This is Ives. He's one of us.

1028
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,410
"Us"! Who are these guys?

1029
01:25:52,477 --> 01:25:54,613
Priya's. Ours.

1030
01:25:54,679 --> 01:25:56,348
How did Sator know
about the ambush?

1031
01:25:56,414 --> 01:25:58,048
It's posterity.

1032
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:00,118
An ambush in the middle of the
street can't stay out of the records.

1033
01:26:00,185 --> 01:26:03,421
Bullshit! He knew every move
we made! Every one of 'em.

1034
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:04,723
Somebody talked. Who was it?

1035
01:26:04,788 --> 01:26:06,790
- Was it you?
- No. No.

1036
01:26:06,857 --> 01:26:08,926
At every stage,
you've known too much.

1037
01:26:08,993 --> 01:26:11,962
I'm going to ask you again.

1038
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:14,898
Did you talk?

1039
01:26:16,434 --> 01:26:17,935
Nobody talked.

1040
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:20,438
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

1041
01:26:21,172 --> 01:26:22,374
A what?

1042
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,645
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

1043
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:28,747
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

1044
01:26:28,812 --> 01:26:32,049
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

1045
01:26:32,117 --> 01:26:33,685
knowing everything.

1046
01:26:33,752 --> 01:26:35,786
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

1047
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:37,455
Which isn't really plutonium,
is it?

1048
01:26:37,522 --> 01:26:39,023
I told you
it was what he was after.

1049
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:41,792
And you just told him
where it was.

1050
01:26:42,527 --> 01:26:44,795
I lied.

1051
01:26:44,862 --> 01:26:47,666
Jesus.
You lied about it?

1052
01:26:47,732 --> 01:26:52,170
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

1053
01:26:52,237 --> 01:26:54,706
Lying is standard
operating procedure.

1054
01:26:54,773 --> 01:26:55,973
It's spread too far.

1055
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,041
Meaning what?

1056
01:26:57,108 --> 01:26:58,376
She's gonna die.

1057
01:26:58,443 --> 01:27:00,145
Standard
operating procedure.

1058
01:27:00,211 --> 01:27:02,046
Can't you help her?
Can we do something?

1059
01:27:02,113 --> 01:27:05,049
Can't we stabilize the inverse
radiation by inverting the patient?

1060
01:27:05,116 --> 01:27:06,251
Takes days.

1061
01:27:06,318 --> 01:27:08,018
Let's go.

1062
01:27:08,086 --> 01:27:10,422
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.

1063
01:27:10,488 --> 01:27:12,791
How long is she gonna live
on this side?

1064
01:27:12,856 --> 01:27:14,526
Three hours, tops.

1065
01:27:14,592 --> 01:27:16,060
I'm taking her through.

1066
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:18,263
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

1067
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:20,964
There's no way of
bringing you back.

1068
01:27:21,031 --> 01:27:22,367
We find another machine.

1069
01:27:22,434 --> 01:27:23,967
A week ago? Where?

1070
01:27:25,869 --> 01:27:27,339
Oslo.

1071
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:29,973
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

1072
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,810
It's impregnable.

1073
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,944
Mmm... It wasn't last week.

1074
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:35,547
We're going in.

1075
01:27:35,613 --> 01:27:36,880
You might as well help us.

1076
01:27:38,048 --> 01:27:39,250
This is a proving window.

1077
01:27:39,317 --> 01:27:40,685
As you approach the turnstile,

1078
01:27:40,752 --> 01:27:42,587
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

1079
01:27:42,654 --> 01:27:43,755
do not enter the machine.

1080
01:27:43,822 --> 01:27:45,223
Why not?

1081
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,624
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

1082
01:27:46,691 --> 01:27:47,759
then you ain't getting out.

1083
01:27:47,826 --> 01:27:50,395
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

1084
01:27:50,462 --> 01:27:52,197
See for yourself.

1085
01:27:52,263 --> 01:27:54,332
There's your answer. Let's go.

1086
01:28:18,956 --> 01:28:20,325
She's stabilizing
slowly.

1087
01:28:20,392 --> 01:28:21,992
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

1088
01:28:22,059 --> 01:28:23,361
How long does she need?

1089
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:26,997
Four, five days.
A week to be sure.

1090
01:28:27,064 --> 01:28:28,666
Hey, Neil. Find a way
to get us to Oslo.

1091
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:29,933
I'm going back out there.

1092
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:33,705
To do what?

1093
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:35,607
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

1094
01:28:35,673 --> 01:28:37,975
You didn't. You lied
about where it was.

1095
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,744
Wait.

1096
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:41,112
You're going out there for her.

1097
01:28:41,179 --> 01:28:42,847
He threatened to kill her
in the past.

1098
01:28:42,913 --> 01:28:44,749
If he does,
what happens to her here?

1099
01:28:46,016 --> 01:28:47,918
That's unknowable.

1100
01:28:47,985 --> 01:28:50,188
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

1101
01:28:50,255 --> 01:28:51,756
What do you believe?

1102
01:28:51,823 --> 01:28:53,991
What's happened's happened.

1103
01:28:54,057 --> 01:28:56,761
We need to save her,
here and now.

1104
01:28:56,828 --> 01:29:00,532
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

1105
01:29:00,598 --> 01:29:02,867
Don't let them
take her back through there.

1106
01:29:02,933 --> 01:29:03,802
Okay?

1107
01:29:03,868 --> 01:29:05,537
We can't stay here.

1108
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,139
We don't have a lot of time.

1109
01:29:08,206 --> 01:29:11,276
So why don't you find us
a nice, cozy shipping container

1110
01:29:11,342 --> 01:29:13,678
that's just come off a ship
from Oslo?

1111
01:29:13,745 --> 01:29:15,213
This is cowboy shit.

1112
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,748
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into

1113
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:18,149
if you go through that door.

1114
01:29:18,216 --> 01:29:19,983
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

1115
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,853
Wheeler, brief him.

1116
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,721
You'll need your own air.

1117
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:26,825
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

1118
01:29:26,891 --> 01:29:28,326
Number one rule:

1119
01:29:28,393 --> 01:29:30,595
don't come into contact
with your forward self.

1120
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:33,531
It's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.

1121
01:29:33,598 --> 01:29:34,799
We don't have time.

1122
01:29:34,866 --> 01:29:37,368
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

1123
01:29:37,435 --> 01:29:38,436
What?

1124
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:39,537
Annihilation.

1125
01:29:39,604 --> 01:29:41,206
That would be bad, right?

1126
01:29:41,272 --> 01:29:45,276
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

1127
01:29:45,343 --> 01:29:47,645
Things will feel strange.

1128
01:29:47,712 --> 01:29:49,747
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

1129
01:29:49,814 --> 01:29:53,117
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

1130
01:29:53,184 --> 01:29:54,985
as the transfer of heat
is reversed.

1131
01:29:55,052 --> 01:29:59,824
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

1132
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:02,694
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

1133
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,061
This is normal.

1134
01:30:04,128 --> 01:30:05,697
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

1135
01:30:05,763 --> 01:30:07,398
I can't vouch
for the handling.

1136
01:30:07,465 --> 01:30:09,868
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

1137
01:30:09,934 --> 01:30:12,069
You are inverted.
The world is not.

1138
01:30:12,136 --> 01:30:13,905
Was the transponder
on the case?

1139
01:30:13,972 --> 01:30:15,573
We've tossed that case.

1140
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,276
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

1141
01:30:18,343 --> 01:30:20,278
Give me the reader.

1142
01:30:24,148 --> 01:30:25,550
Okay.

1143
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:28,018
You ready?

1144
01:33:19,524 --> 01:33:22,493
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

1145
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,697
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

1146
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:27,999
<i>He was lying.</i>

1147
01:33:28,066 --> 01:33:29,901
<i>It wasn't in the BMW.</i>

1148
01:33:29,967 --> 01:33:30,968
<i>So, where is it?</i>

1149
01:34:17,182 --> 01:34:19,184
I saw the handoff.

1150
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:22,286
You made me shoot her
for nothing.

1151
01:34:22,353 --> 01:34:26,457
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

1152
01:34:26,524 --> 01:34:28,160
Not even my wife.

1153
01:34:57,622 --> 01:35:00,491
You left Ives and his
team a hell of a cleanup.

1154
01:35:01,526 --> 01:35:04,362
Heat transfer was reversed.

1155
01:35:04,428 --> 01:35:06,265
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

1156
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:08,466
from a gasoline explosion
in history.

1157
01:35:08,533 --> 01:35:11,469
At this point,
nothing surprises.

1158
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:14,173
We're headed back to Oslo?

1159
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,374
In a Rotas shipping container.

1160
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,309
He's got the material, Neil.

1161
01:35:18,376 --> 01:35:20,411
I handed it to him on a plate.

1162
01:35:20,478 --> 01:35:22,013
I warned you...

1163
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:23,248
What's happened's happened.

1164
01:35:23,314 --> 01:35:25,250
I get it now.

1165
01:35:25,316 --> 01:35:28,019
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

1166
01:35:29,053 --> 01:35:30,321
That's not fair.

1167
01:35:30,388 --> 01:35:32,657
You were a part of this
before we met.

1168
01:35:32,723 --> 01:35:34,025
Were you working for Priya?

1169
01:35:34,092 --> 01:35:35,026
No.

1170
01:35:35,093 --> 01:35:36,828
Who recruited you, Neil?

1171
01:35:36,894 --> 01:35:39,897
It can't possibly do you any
good to know that right now.

1172
01:35:39,964 --> 01:35:44,902
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

1173
01:35:44,969 --> 01:35:47,872
then you can hear
my life story, okay?

1174
01:35:50,142 --> 01:35:51,742
I'm sorry I involved you.

1175
01:35:51,809 --> 01:35:53,644
You need to tell me
what's going on.

1176
01:35:53,711 --> 01:35:56,547
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

1177
01:35:56,614 --> 01:35:58,283
Good luck, pal.

1178
01:35:58,349 --> 01:36:00,685
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

1179
01:36:00,751 --> 01:36:03,387
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

1180
01:36:03,454 --> 01:36:05,823
She has the right to know
why she might die.

1181
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:06,858
Am I gonna die?

1182
01:36:06,924 --> 01:36:08,759
Not if we have something
to say about it.

1183
01:36:08,826 --> 01:36:09,994
And we do.

1184
01:36:10,061 --> 01:36:12,297
Who are you?

1185
01:36:12,363 --> 01:36:16,367
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

1186
01:36:22,174 --> 01:36:24,243
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

1187
01:36:24,309 --> 01:36:27,845
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

1188
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:37,955
You injured?

1189
01:36:43,594 --> 01:36:45,796
What's the algorithm, Neil?

1190
01:36:47,565 --> 01:36:50,835
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.

1191
01:36:52,036 --> 01:36:54,373
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

1192
01:36:54,438 --> 01:36:56,974
so it can't be copied
or communicated.

1193
01:36:57,041 --> 01:36:59,010
It's a black box
with one function.

1194
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:01,846
Which is?

1195
01:37:01,913 --> 01:37:04,982
Inversion. But not objects
or peoples.

1196
01:37:05,049 --> 01:37:06,184
The world around us.

1197
01:37:06,251 --> 01:37:07,685
I don't understand.

1198
01:37:07,752 --> 01:37:10,355
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

1199
01:37:10,421 --> 01:37:14,192
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

1200
01:37:14,259 --> 01:37:17,862
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

1201
01:37:17,929 --> 01:37:18,896
we dominate.

1202
01:37:18,963 --> 01:37:20,598
They're always
swimming upstream.

1203
01:37:20,665 --> 01:37:22,134
It's what saved your life.

1204
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,002
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

1205
01:37:25,069 --> 01:37:26,570
Pissing in the wind.

1206
01:37:26,637 --> 01:37:28,906
And the algorithm can
change the direction of that wind.

1207
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:31,676
It can invert the entropy
of the world.

1208
01:37:32,344 --> 01:37:33,811
And if that happens?

1209
01:37:33,878 --> 01:37:34,912
Oh...

1210
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:36,914
End of play.

1211
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:39,117
"End of play." Can you be
a little more precise?

1212
01:37:39,184 --> 01:37:43,020
Everyone and everything that's ever
lived, destroyed. Instantly.

1213
01:37:43,088 --> 01:37:44,156
Precise enough?

1214
01:37:44,222 --> 01:37:45,923
Including my son.

1215
01:37:48,859 --> 01:37:52,130
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

1216
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:09,214
On a truck.

1217
01:38:11,482 --> 01:38:12,917
Shouldn't be long now.

1218
01:38:13,985 --> 01:38:16,254
I've been thinking.

1219
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:18,190
We're their ancestors.

1220
01:38:18,256 --> 01:38:21,093
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

1221
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:23,494
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

1222
01:38:23,561 --> 01:38:24,895
The what?

1223
01:38:25,629 --> 01:38:27,031
If you went back in time

1224
01:38:27,099 --> 01:38:28,699
and killed
your own grandfather,

1225
01:38:28,766 --> 01:38:30,701
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

1226
01:38:30,768 --> 01:38:31,969
What's the answer?

1227
01:38:32,036 --> 01:38:34,106
There's no answer.
It's a paradox.

1228
01:38:34,172 --> 01:38:35,307
But in the future,

1229
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:36,974
those in power clearly believe
that you can

1230
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:38,542
kick grandpa down the stairs,

1231
01:38:38,609 --> 01:38:40,379
gouge his eyes out,

1232
01:38:40,445 --> 01:38:41,645
slit his throat,

1233
01:38:41,712 --> 01:38:43,415
without consequence.

1234
01:38:43,482 --> 01:38:45,250
Could they be right?

1235
01:38:45,317 --> 01:38:46,951
Doesn't matter.

1236
01:38:47,018 --> 01:38:48,686
They believe it.

1237
01:38:48,753 --> 01:38:50,955
So they're willing
to destroy us.

1238
01:38:52,623 --> 01:38:54,359
Can I go back to sleep now?

1239
01:38:54,426 --> 01:38:55,893
No. I thought of
something else.

1240
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,861
Great.

1241
01:38:56,927 --> 01:38:58,896
This reversing
the flow of time.

1242
01:38:58,963 --> 01:39:01,766
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

1243
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:04,102
That we stop them?

1244
01:39:04,169 --> 01:39:06,505
Optimistically, I'd say
that's right.

1245
01:39:06,604 --> 01:39:08,173
Pessimistically?

1246
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,674
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

1247
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:13,811
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

1248
01:39:13,878 --> 01:39:15,347
Does your head hurt yet?

1249
01:39:15,414 --> 01:39:16,747
Yes.

1250
01:39:20,485 --> 01:39:22,019
Try to sleep.

1251
01:39:36,867 --> 01:39:38,236
Shit.

1252
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:41,739
They didn't take us inside.

1253
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,642
What do we do?

1254
01:39:47,745 --> 01:39:49,046
We use the breach.

1255
01:39:49,114 --> 01:39:51,183
The chaos right after impact.
Get ready.

1256
01:39:54,152 --> 01:39:55,753
She healed enough?

1257
01:39:56,488 --> 01:39:58,323
I don't know.

1258
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:59,757
I've never done this before.

1259
01:39:59,824 --> 01:40:02,494
The fire crew's there.

1260
01:40:02,561 --> 01:40:03,994
You take Kat
through the breach,

1261
01:40:04,061 --> 01:40:05,863
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.

1262
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:07,532
Then you bring her in.

1263
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:10,235
How's your arm?

1264
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:11,936
Not good.

1265
01:40:16,374 --> 01:40:18,243
We move as soon as
we hear the engines.

1266
01:40:22,746 --> 01:40:23,914
- Hold on, hold on.
- What?

1267
01:40:23,981 --> 01:40:25,850
You're bleeding.

1268
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,285
All right, let me take
a look at it.

1269
01:40:33,891 --> 01:40:35,093
Ready?

1270
01:41:07,892 --> 01:41:09,427
Wait here. I'm going in.

1271
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:08,280
Come on!

1272
01:43:08,346 --> 01:43:09,381
Go, go, go!

1273
01:43:39,644 --> 01:43:40,512
Go!

1274
01:45:22,747 --> 01:45:24,616
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

1275
01:45:24,682 --> 01:45:25,949
Why didn't you say?

1276
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:27,585
That's a lot of explaining

1277
01:45:27,652 --> 01:45:29,052
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

1278
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,388
But afterwards?

1279
01:45:30,455 --> 01:45:33,725
Thing's the same,
I knew you'd be okay.

1280
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:35,326
What's happened's happened.

1281
01:45:35,393 --> 01:45:38,630
If I told you and you acted
differently, who knows?

1282
01:45:40,231 --> 01:45:42,801
The policy is to suppress.

1283
01:45:42,867 --> 01:45:44,702
Whose policy?

1284
01:45:44,769 --> 01:45:46,104
Ours, my friend.

1285
01:45:49,441 --> 01:45:52,544
We're the people saving the
world from what might've been.

1286
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:03,488
Kat?

1287
01:46:04,456 --> 01:46:06,391
I'm here.

1288
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,092
It'll be quite a scar.

1289
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:09,527
You'll be okay.

1290
01:46:11,896 --> 01:46:13,164
Did it.

1291
01:46:13,231 --> 01:46:15,133
You did what?

1292
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,101
Andrei has the algorithm.

1293
01:46:18,035 --> 01:46:20,037
You don't know where he is.

1294
01:46:21,972 --> 01:46:23,341
Or when.

1295
01:46:24,442 --> 01:46:26,744
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

1296
01:46:26,811 --> 01:46:29,814
If I don't do something, in two
days, she tells me about the 241.

1297
01:46:29,881 --> 01:46:31,483
Nothing can change that.

1298
01:46:31,549 --> 01:46:32,550
We'll see.

1299
01:46:33,184 --> 01:46:34,652
Just get her here.

1300
01:46:37,155 --> 01:46:38,289
Hello, Priya.

1301
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:40,658
What's going on?

1302
01:46:40,725 --> 01:46:42,260
Where's Neil?

1303
01:46:42,327 --> 01:46:45,864
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.

1304
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:46,931
What did I do?

1305
01:46:46,997 --> 01:46:48,533
It's what you're going to do.

1306
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,768
In two days, you're gonna have
me dangle plutonium-241

1307
01:46:50,835 --> 01:46:53,304
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

1308
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:55,106
Now, I wanna know why.

1309
01:46:55,173 --> 01:46:57,308
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1310
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:59,377
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.

1311
01:47:00,879 --> 01:47:03,214
So, tell me about it, Priya.

1312
01:47:03,281 --> 01:47:05,717
It's... It's unique.

1313
01:47:05,783 --> 01:47:07,652
The scientist who built it
took her own life

1314
01:47:07,719 --> 01:47:09,354
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

1315
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:10,622
A scientist in the future?

1316
01:47:10,688 --> 01:47:11,689
Generations from now.

1317
01:47:11,756 --> 01:47:13,525
Why does she have to
kill herself?

1318
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:16,528
You're familiar
with the Manhattan Project?

1319
01:47:16,594 --> 01:47:18,696
As they approached
the first atomic test,

1320
01:47:18,763 --> 01:47:20,265
Oppenheimer became concerned

1321
01:47:20,331 --> 01:47:23,066
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

1322
01:47:23,134 --> 01:47:24,369
engulfing the world.

1323
01:47:24,435 --> 01:47:25,970
They went ahead anyway
and got lucky.

1324
01:47:26,036 --> 01:47:30,642
Think of our scientist as
her generation's Oppenheimer.

1325
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:33,244
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

1326
01:47:33,311 --> 01:47:36,046
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

1327
01:47:36,114 --> 01:47:37,749
they're destroying themselves.

1328
01:47:37,815 --> 01:47:39,684
The grandfather paradox.

1329
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:41,653
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

1330
01:47:41,719 --> 01:47:42,854
she rebels,

1331
01:47:42,921 --> 01:47:45,156
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

1332
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:47,759
and hiding them the best place
she can think of.

1333
01:47:48,426 --> 01:47:49,494
The past.

1334
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:50,461
Here, now.

1335
01:47:50,528 --> 01:47:52,964
There are nine nuclear powers.

1336
01:47:53,031 --> 01:47:54,999
Nine bombs.

1337
01:47:55,065 --> 01:47:58,036
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

1338
01:47:58,102 --> 01:48:00,138
The best hiding place possible.

1339
01:48:00,204 --> 01:48:03,007
Nuclear containment facilities.

1340
01:48:03,073 --> 01:48:04,475
Sator's lifelong mission,

1341
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:07,178
financed and guided
by the future, has been to

1342
01:48:07,245 --> 01:48:09,681
find and reassemble
the algorithm.

1343
01:48:09,747 --> 01:48:10,982
Why do they choose him?

1344
01:48:11,049 --> 01:48:12,984
Because he was at the right
place at the right time.

1345
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:15,053
The collapse of
the Soviet Union.

1346
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:18,456
The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.

1347
01:48:18,523 --> 01:48:20,925
How many sections does he have?

1348
01:48:20,992 --> 01:48:22,727
After the 241, all nine.

1349
01:48:22,794 --> 01:48:24,596
Jesus Christ.

1350
01:48:24,662 --> 01:48:27,832
And that's why you're going to
do things differently this time.

1351
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,201
To change things?

1352
01:48:30,268 --> 01:48:31,536
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1353
01:48:31,603 --> 01:48:34,105
So Sator won't get
the algorithm.

1354
01:48:35,974 --> 01:48:38,343
If that universe can exist...

1355
01:48:38,409 --> 01:48:39,677
we don't live in it.

1356
01:48:39,744 --> 01:48:41,679
Well, let's try.

1357
01:48:41,746 --> 01:48:43,581
You're going to warn me.

1358
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,249
No, I'm not.

1359
01:48:45,316 --> 01:48:46,884
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1360
01:48:46,951 --> 01:48:48,186
Come on.

1361
01:48:48,252 --> 01:48:50,388
If you had known
what the algorithm was,

1362
01:48:50,455 --> 01:48:52,757
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?

1363
01:48:53,891 --> 01:48:55,860
You want Sator to get
the last section.

1364
01:48:55,927 --> 01:48:58,596
That is the only way he'll
bring together the other eight.

1365
01:48:58,663 --> 01:49:00,898
I was supposed to steal it...

1366
01:49:00,965 --> 01:49:02,101
then lose it?

1367
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:04,035
Mission accomplished.

1368
01:49:04,103 --> 01:49:05,637
You used me.

1369
01:49:06,471 --> 01:49:08,640
As you used Katherine.

1370
01:49:08,706 --> 01:49:10,942
Standard operating procedure.

1371
01:49:12,111 --> 01:49:13,511
You've done your part.

1372
01:49:14,078 --> 01:49:15,346
My part?

1373
01:49:15,413 --> 01:49:17,982
I'm the protagonist
of this operation.

1374
01:49:18,049 --> 01:49:19,217
You...

1375
01:49:19,283 --> 01:49:21,086
are a protagonist.

1376
01:49:21,152 --> 01:49:24,123
Did you think you were the only
one capable of saving the world?

1377
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,161
No.

1378
01:49:31,262 --> 01:49:32,864
But I am.

1379
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:34,232
Because I haven't told you

1380
01:49:34,298 --> 01:49:36,101
where he's assembling the
algorithm or when.

1381
01:49:36,167 --> 01:49:37,301
You're about to.

1382
01:49:37,368 --> 01:49:38,970
No, I'm not.

1383
01:49:39,037 --> 01:49:40,304
So, deal us in.

1384
01:49:41,305 --> 01:49:42,674
"Us"?

1385
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:44,308
Why would you want to
involve her again?

1386
01:49:44,375 --> 01:49:45,877
Because she can get
close to him.

1387
01:49:45,943 --> 01:49:47,245
Does he still trust her?

1388
01:49:47,311 --> 01:49:48,713
He thinks she's dead.

1389
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:50,081
But he used to.

1390
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:52,350
You have started looking at
the world in a new way.

1391
01:49:52,417 --> 01:49:53,785
And now, it's your turn.

1392
01:49:53,851 --> 01:49:55,520
Assuming she
makes it out alive,

1393
01:49:55,586 --> 01:49:57,822
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

1394
01:49:57,889 --> 01:49:58,990
I can't.

1395
01:49:59,057 --> 01:50:00,391
If you don't have
the authority,

1396
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:02,827
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

1397
01:50:02,894 --> 01:50:04,562
I need your word

1398
01:50:04,629 --> 01:50:07,598
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.

1399
01:50:07,665 --> 01:50:09,634
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

1400
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:16,607
They'll be safe.

1401
01:50:18,509 --> 01:50:20,645
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.

1402
01:50:20,712 --> 01:50:22,346
<i>Get yourselves up there.</i>

1403
01:50:22,413 --> 01:50:24,315
<i>Ives has a team
ready to invert.</i>

1404
01:50:24,382 --> 01:50:25,850
<i>You have
a turnstile?</i>

1405
01:50:25,917 --> 01:50:28,453
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

1406
01:50:28,519 --> 01:50:31,222
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

1407
01:50:31,289 --> 01:50:33,391
But there are some people,
in the future,

1408
01:50:33,458 --> 01:50:36,961
who want to continue the
algorithm's journey into the past.

1409
01:50:38,029 --> 01:50:39,564
You see...

1410
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:42,533
<i>Tenet wasn't founded
in the past.</i>

1411
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,803
<i>It will be founded
in the future.</i>

1412
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:14,065
Can't get over the birds.

1413
01:51:14,133 --> 01:51:15,933
How're you feeling?

1414
01:51:21,206 --> 01:51:22,840
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

1415
01:51:23,641 --> 01:51:24,575
I can't.

1416
01:51:24,642 --> 01:51:25,810
Why not?

1417
01:51:25,877 --> 01:51:27,578
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

1418
01:51:27,645 --> 01:51:29,747
Not with a dead man's switch.

1419
01:51:29,814 --> 01:51:32,084
The fitness tracker he wears.

1420
01:51:32,151 --> 01:51:33,351
He's obsessive
about his health.

1421
01:51:33,417 --> 01:51:34,619
It'll be linked
to a switch,

1422
01:51:34,685 --> 01:51:36,788
probably a simple e-mail burst

1423
01:51:36,854 --> 01:51:38,623
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

1424
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:40,625
set to fire if his heart stops.

1425
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:43,095
His death activates
the algorithm.

1426
01:51:43,162 --> 01:51:44,962
He dies, the world ends.

1427
01:51:45,029 --> 01:51:46,697
No one dares kill him.

1428
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,935
No, you've missed the point.

1429
01:51:53,205 --> 01:51:54,739
He's intending to end his life.

1430
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:57,975
Why?

1431
01:51:59,811 --> 01:52:01,345
He's dying.

1432
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:04,415
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1433
01:52:05,716 --> 01:52:07,718
And he's taking the world
with him.

1434
01:52:07,785 --> 01:52:10,021
If he can't have her,
no one can.

1435
01:52:10,088 --> 01:52:14,293
He gets to choose the time and
place for the end of the world.

1436
01:52:14,358 --> 01:52:16,894
What moment?
What does he choose?

1437
01:52:18,729 --> 01:52:21,699
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

1438
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:23,334
Vietnam.

1439
01:52:23,401 --> 01:52:25,369
You said he vanished. What day?

1440
01:52:25,436 --> 01:52:27,805
I went ashore with Max and he flew
off, but I don't know what day it was.

1441
01:52:27,872 --> 01:52:30,209
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

1442
01:52:30,275 --> 01:52:31,576
He was in Ukraine.

1443
01:52:31,642 --> 01:52:33,312
At the Kiev opera siege.

1444
01:52:33,377 --> 01:52:36,848
How do you know about that?

1445
01:52:36,914 --> 01:52:39,151
The point is, he wasn't on his
yacht, so that's his window.

1446
01:52:39,218 --> 01:52:41,819
To go back to that golden
moment and have it be his last.

1447
01:52:41,886 --> 01:52:43,521
Everyone's last.

1448
01:52:43,588 --> 01:52:45,356
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

1449
01:52:45,423 --> 01:52:46,724
without Sator knowing.

1450
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:49,026
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

1451
01:52:49,094 --> 01:52:50,528
And not the rest of us.

1452
01:52:50,595 --> 01:52:51,729
Where's the dead drop?

1453
01:52:51,796 --> 01:52:53,497
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1454
01:52:53,564 --> 01:52:54,632
You're not gonna tell me?

1455
01:52:54,699 --> 01:52:56,101
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1456
01:52:56,168 --> 01:52:58,103
But I need you back
on that yacht, Kat.

1457
01:52:58,170 --> 01:53:00,004
Why?

1458
01:53:00,071 --> 01:53:02,440
You have to stop him killing
himself until we know the algorithm

1459
01:53:02,506 --> 01:53:04,442
is out of the dead drop.

1460
01:53:04,508 --> 01:53:06,577
But if I'm caught there,
my son sees.

1461
01:53:06,644 --> 01:53:08,379
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

1462
01:53:08,446 --> 01:53:10,648
if they're gonna be his last.

1463
01:53:11,316 --> 01:53:12,583
They're not.

1464
01:53:37,508 --> 01:53:38,743
It's time.

1465
01:53:38,809 --> 01:53:40,178
We're working our way
back to the 14th,

1466
01:53:40,245 --> 01:53:41,913
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

1467
01:53:41,979 --> 01:53:44,548
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

1468
01:53:45,616 --> 01:53:48,719
You know what a hypocenter is?

1469
01:53:48,786 --> 01:53:51,123
It's ground zero for
an underground nuclear test.

1470
01:53:51,189 --> 01:53:56,295
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

1471
01:53:56,361 --> 01:53:58,696
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

1472
01:53:58,763 --> 01:54:01,766
That explosion
seals up the algorithm.

1473
01:54:01,832 --> 01:54:03,534
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

1474
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:05,803
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1475
01:54:07,939 --> 01:54:09,707
<i>Line it up.</i>

1476
01:54:09,774 --> 01:54:10,975
<i>Move forward.</i>

1477
01:54:13,077 --> 01:54:14,078
<i>Next.</i>

1478
01:54:18,317 --> 01:54:19,517
<i>Line it up.</i>

1479
01:54:21,153 --> 01:54:22,486
Where's Neil?

1480
01:54:25,424 --> 01:54:26,657
He must've
gone through already.

1481
01:54:26,724 --> 01:54:28,492
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1482
01:54:28,559 --> 01:54:30,195
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1483
01:54:30,262 --> 01:54:31,896
I'd like to say...

1484
01:54:31,963 --> 01:54:33,798
that you don't have to
do this, Kat...

1485
01:54:33,864 --> 01:54:36,968
Worst thing Andrei ever did to
me was that offer he made me.

1486
01:54:37,034 --> 01:54:40,238
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

1487
01:54:41,505 --> 01:54:43,507
I shouted and...

1488
01:54:43,574 --> 01:54:45,676
<i>swore.</i>

1489
01:54:45,743 --> 01:54:48,146
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

1490
01:54:51,482 --> 01:54:53,684
I considered it.

1491
01:54:53,751 --> 01:54:55,987
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

1492
01:54:56,053 --> 01:54:58,123
or because he knows that
about me.

1493
01:54:58,522 --> 01:54:59,724
Oh.

1494
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:02,927
A chance to help save my child.

1495
01:55:02,994 --> 01:55:05,197
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

1496
01:55:05,263 --> 01:55:06,564
No.

1497
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,499
You've killed people
you've hated before.

1498
01:55:08,566 --> 01:55:10,001
It's not usually personal.

1499
01:55:10,067 --> 01:55:12,069
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

1500
01:55:12,137 --> 01:55:13,938
It always counts, Kat.

1501
01:55:14,005 --> 01:55:17,476
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

1502
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:20,412
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

1503
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:22,180
he takes us all with him.

1504
01:55:24,749 --> 01:55:27,018
You just keep up
your end, okay?

1505
01:55:30,955 --> 01:55:32,491
Today's the 14th.

1506
01:55:32,556 --> 01:55:34,159
Offshore of Siberia.

1507
01:55:34,226 --> 01:55:35,559
Time for us to go.

1508
01:55:35,626 --> 01:55:36,927
You keep going back
another day,

1509
01:55:36,994 --> 01:55:38,829
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

1510
01:55:38,896 --> 01:55:39,997
And who gets me on the yacht?

1511
01:55:40,064 --> 01:55:41,866
I've got somebody good
lined up.

1512
01:55:41,932 --> 01:55:44,902
When it's over, when you're
raising your boy, carry this.

1513
01:55:44,969 --> 01:55:47,305
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

1514
01:55:47,372 --> 01:55:50,608
Hit "talk," state your
location, hang up.

1515
01:55:50,674 --> 01:55:52,643
Who gets the message?

1516
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:54,612
Posterity.

1517
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:35,353
Stalsk-12.

1518
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:38,523
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

1519
01:56:38,589 --> 01:56:42,993
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1520
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:46,797
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

1521
01:56:46,864 --> 01:56:48,400
We're Red Team, moving forward.

1522
01:56:48,467 --> 01:56:50,901
In order to distinguish
the teams, you'll wear these.

1523
01:56:50,968 --> 01:56:52,437
Our friends over there,

1524
01:56:52,504 --> 01:56:54,805
Blue Team, led by Commander
Wheeler, are inverted.

1525
01:56:54,872 --> 01:56:57,007
Why don't they let us see them?

1526
01:56:57,074 --> 01:56:58,477
Maybe we won't like
what happened.

1527
01:56:58,543 --> 01:57:01,546
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

1528
01:57:03,315 --> 01:57:06,784
Then, were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter,

1529
01:57:06,851 --> 01:57:09,087
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

1530
01:57:09,154 --> 01:57:13,091
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

1531
01:57:13,158 --> 01:57:17,162
Now, this briefing has the
benefit of their experience.

1532
01:57:33,911 --> 01:57:35,846
Both teams have
countdown watches.

1533
01:57:35,913 --> 01:57:38,483
Ours counts down from ten,
from landing

1534
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:40,385
to zero to the explosion.

1535
01:57:40,452 --> 01:57:42,120
- <i>Blue Team is reversed.</i>
- Everybody, look to your left.

1536
01:57:42,187 --> 01:57:46,224
If you are not at the LZ
at zero, you are not leaving.

1537
01:57:47,292 --> 01:57:48,560
Do you understand?

1538
01:57:48,627 --> 01:57:52,230
We drop in, clear LZs
for Blue Team evacuation.

1539
01:57:52,297 --> 01:57:54,031
We make our way
into the city proper.

1540
01:57:54,099 --> 01:57:56,734
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

1541
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,436
there is a turnstile.

1542
01:57:58,503 --> 01:58:00,505
Expect a bitemporal response.

1543
01:58:00,572 --> 01:58:01,972
They'll have inverse ordnance?

1544
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:04,309
Inverse, conventional,

1545
01:58:04,376 --> 01:58:07,678
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

1546
01:58:07,745 --> 01:58:09,247
On the other side of the city,

1547
01:58:09,314 --> 01:58:11,583
the ground rises to the ridge
above the hypocenter.

1548
01:58:11,650 --> 01:58:15,086
A splinter unit will take this
tunnel from the city

1549
01:58:15,153 --> 01:58:17,088
to the floor of the hypocenter.

1550
01:58:17,155 --> 01:58:19,857
Blue Team located
an entrance here.

1551
01:58:19,924 --> 01:58:22,026
The bomb is in this rock,

1552
01:58:22,093 --> 01:58:25,230
high above,
to trigger a collapse,

1553
01:58:25,297 --> 01:58:26,198
sealing the cavern.

1554
01:58:26,264 --> 01:58:27,898
How do we defuse the bomb
up there?

1555
01:58:27,965 --> 01:58:30,435
We don't. The explosion
takes place as planned.

1556
01:58:30,502 --> 01:58:34,439
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

1557
01:58:34,506 --> 01:58:38,243
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

1558
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:39,110
Which is?

1559
01:58:39,177 --> 01:58:41,379
Need-to-know, and you don't.

1560
01:58:41,446 --> 01:58:43,215
Any other stupid questions?

1561
01:58:43,281 --> 01:58:45,916
Good. Well, let's go.
Let's get ready.

1562
01:58:48,653 --> 01:58:50,054
I wanted to be
on the first wave.

1563
01:58:50,121 --> 01:58:51,523
There is no first wave.

1564
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:54,392
Red Team and Blue Team
operate simultaneously.

1565
01:58:54,459 --> 01:58:56,194
Look,

1566
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:58,396
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1567
01:58:58,463 --> 01:59:01,799
Now, you wanna be on the team that
lifts the contents of the capsule?

1568
01:59:01,865 --> 01:59:03,901
Absolutely.

1569
01:59:03,968 --> 01:59:06,036
Yeah, that's us.

1570
01:59:06,104 --> 01:59:07,572
We're splinter unit.

1571
01:59:07,639 --> 01:59:09,407
Just us?

1572
01:59:09,474 --> 01:59:13,111
No one who knows the contents of
that capsule can leave the field.

1573
01:59:13,178 --> 01:59:15,946
I thought we'd
manage ourselves.

1574
01:59:25,457 --> 01:59:27,592
It's 40 feet from the
private deck to the water.

1575
01:59:27,659 --> 01:59:29,227
Can you jump it?

1576
01:59:29,294 --> 01:59:30,562
I can dive it.

1577
01:59:30,629 --> 01:59:33,331
Until you see my signal,
you don't let him die.

1578
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:10,602
Thirty seconds!

1579
02:00:51,676 --> 02:00:52,876
Go! Go! Go!

1580
02:01:04,356 --> 02:01:06,458
We're coming in
on a shockwave.

1581
02:01:06,524 --> 02:01:07,858
Hang on, people.

1582
02:01:16,801 --> 02:01:18,236
On your feet!

1583
02:01:31,816 --> 02:01:33,318
There!

1584
02:01:46,297 --> 02:01:47,998
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

1585
02:01:48,065 --> 02:01:49,701
Well, I snuck back
to surprise Andrei.

1586
02:01:49,768 --> 02:01:50,702
Oh, the boss left.

1587
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:54,539
Well, have Mr. Sator
find me here.

1588
02:01:54,606 --> 02:01:55,939
And don't tell the others.

1589
02:01:56,006 --> 02:01:57,375
I'll get the mess.

1590
02:03:04,876 --> 02:03:05,976
Mines!

1591
02:03:06,043 --> 02:03:07,212
Mines!

1592
02:03:21,292 --> 02:03:22,627
They told me
you'd gone ashore.

1593
02:03:24,995 --> 02:03:26,164
They told me you'd flown off.

1594
02:03:26,231 --> 02:03:28,399
I came back to see you and Max.

1595
02:03:28,466 --> 02:03:31,669
Max is on shore with Anna.

1596
02:03:31,736 --> 02:03:33,471
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

1597
02:03:33,538 --> 02:03:36,541
I was joking.
It was a stupid joke.

1598
02:03:36,608 --> 02:03:38,409
You think I'm
a terrible mother.

1599
02:03:38,476 --> 02:03:42,045
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

1600
02:03:49,587 --> 02:03:52,257
I want things
to be better, Andrei.

1601
02:04:07,772 --> 02:04:09,107
Take cover!

1602
02:04:13,211 --> 02:04:15,113
Get me a goddamn AT4!

1603
02:04:15,179 --> 02:04:16,981
Take him out, now!

1604
02:04:17,047 --> 02:04:18,449
Provide some cover!

1605
02:04:18,516 --> 02:04:20,652
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1606
02:04:20,718 --> 02:04:22,153
Move, move, move!

1607
02:05:32,256 --> 02:05:33,324
Wheeler!

1608
02:05:34,892 --> 02:05:35,960
Get outta there!

1609
02:05:36,027 --> 02:05:37,362
Come on!

1610
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:43,768
Ives!

1611
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:47,672
Splinter unit. Here.

1612
02:05:49,307 --> 02:05:51,309
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

1613
02:05:51,376 --> 02:05:56,147
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

1614
02:05:56,214 --> 02:05:59,118
I'll make you a drink.

1615
02:05:59,183 --> 02:06:01,386
Bring my son back to the boat.

1616
02:06:07,592 --> 02:06:08,860
We're runnin' out of time,
let's go!

1617
02:06:08,926 --> 02:06:11,329
If they see us,
it's all for nothing.

1618
02:06:14,966 --> 02:06:16,135
We need a distraction.

1619
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,835
Don't worry about that.

1620
02:06:21,372 --> 02:06:22,907
On my mark!

1621
02:06:25,777 --> 02:06:28,246
RPG, hit the base!

1622
02:06:28,312 --> 02:06:29,514
That building
on my mark!

1623
02:06:31,649 --> 02:06:33,351
Three! Two!

1624
02:06:33,418 --> 02:06:35,420
One! Fire!

1625
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,655
Fire!

1626
02:06:52,437 --> 02:06:53,905
Move! Move!

1627
02:07:09,487 --> 02:07:11,689
We're committed now. Come on.

1628
02:07:17,929 --> 02:07:19,464
What's that?

1629
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:22,300
I borrowed it
from the CIA.

1630
02:07:23,367 --> 02:07:24,469
What is it?

1631
02:07:24,535 --> 02:07:27,004
The way the world ends.

1632
02:07:27,071 --> 02:07:29,907
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1633
02:07:29,974 --> 02:07:31,609
I don't understand.

1634
02:07:31,676 --> 02:07:33,811
When I take this,
it's all over.

1635
02:07:34,545 --> 02:07:36,647
Then don't take it yet.

1636
02:07:39,684 --> 02:07:41,385
Why not?

1637
02:07:42,653 --> 02:07:45,090
Because we have
the sunset coming.

1638
02:07:45,157 --> 02:07:47,592
And a little vodka left.

1639
02:07:47,658 --> 02:07:49,694
And Max will be here soon.

1640
02:07:49,761 --> 02:07:53,965
They said they thought it was
you, not Anna, ashore with Max.

1641
02:07:56,634 --> 02:08:00,371
So long as you can tell
the difference.

1642
02:08:02,306 --> 02:08:05,009
A moment's business, my love.

1643
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:18,489
<i>Mahir, do you copy?</i>

1644
02:08:18,556 --> 02:08:21,859
<i>Not clear. I repeat, not clear!</i>

1645
02:08:21,926 --> 02:08:23,060
Copy that.

1646
02:08:23,128 --> 02:08:26,430
I repeat, not clear!

1647
02:08:52,857 --> 02:08:53,925
Neil!

1648
02:08:54,759 --> 02:08:55,827
Neil!

1649
02:09:08,739 --> 02:09:09,841
Go!

1650
02:09:18,583 --> 02:09:21,519
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

1651
02:09:27,558 --> 02:09:29,493
Try him.
See if he's got a grenade.

1652
02:09:34,099 --> 02:09:35,167
Anything?

1653
02:09:35,234 --> 02:09:36,667
Nah, nothing.

1654
02:09:36,734 --> 02:09:39,104
Here, you try having
a look. Can you pick it?

1655
02:09:39,171 --> 02:09:40,404
<i>I hope not.</i>

1656
02:09:40,471 --> 02:09:42,274
<i>I paid a lot for that lock.</i>

1657
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:45,344
<i>How do you like where my
journey began and yours ends?</i>

1658
02:09:45,409 --> 02:09:46,878
Little radioactive
for my taste.

1659
02:09:46,944 --> 02:09:50,982
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

1660
02:09:51,048 --> 02:09:53,818
We'd work where
no one else would.

1661
02:09:53,885 --> 02:09:56,520
I made a bargain
with the devil.

1662
02:09:56,587 --> 02:09:58,323
Money for time.

1663
02:09:58,389 --> 02:10:00,292
We sold our futures.

1664
02:10:00,359 --> 02:10:03,527
And now you're about to make the
same mistake for the entire world.

1665
02:10:03,594 --> 02:10:06,898
<i>It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.</i>

1666
02:10:06,964 --> 02:10:08,300
<i>What was yours?</i>

1667
02:10:08,367 --> 02:10:11,203
<i>You fight for a cause
you barely understand...</i>

1668
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:14,939
<i>with people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.</i>

1669
02:10:15,006 --> 02:10:17,342
<i>When I die,
the world dies with me.</i>

1670
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:19,344
And your knowledge
dies with you,

1671
02:10:19,410 --> 02:10:23,080
<i>buried in a tomb like an
anonymous Egyptian builder</i>

1672
02:10:23,148 --> 02:10:25,750
<i>sealed in a pyramid
to keep his secret.</i>

1673
02:10:25,816 --> 02:10:28,552
Your faith is blind.
You're a fanatic.

1674
02:10:48,739 --> 02:10:51,542
<i>What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?</i>

1675
02:10:51,609 --> 02:10:54,346
I'm not,
I'm creating a new one.

1676
02:10:54,413 --> 02:10:58,883
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a
crystalline tower throws a switch

1677
02:10:58,950 --> 02:11:02,687
and Armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

1678
02:11:02,753 --> 02:11:06,325
Now time itself
switches direction.

1679
02:11:06,391 --> 02:11:08,526
<i>The same sunshine we basked in</i>

1680
02:11:08,592 --> 02:11:12,730
<i>will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.</i>

1681
02:11:12,797 --> 02:11:14,799
How could they wanna kill us?

1682
02:11:14,865 --> 02:11:18,069
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

1683
02:11:18,136 --> 02:11:22,441
<i>Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.</i>

1684
02:11:22,506 --> 02:11:24,675
We're responsible.

1685
02:11:37,922 --> 02:11:40,725
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

1686
02:11:41,959 --> 02:11:43,295
Yes.

1687
02:11:43,362 --> 02:11:45,663
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

1688
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:47,665
That's exactly
what they're doing.

1689
02:11:47,732 --> 02:11:49,934
<i>But not you. You're a traitor.</i>

1690
02:11:50,001 --> 02:11:51,535
Bringing death to all,
because you have no life

1691
02:11:51,602 --> 02:11:53,205
of your own left.

1692
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:55,107
<i>When I'm done, life continues.</i>

1693
02:11:55,173 --> 02:11:56,841
<i>Not your son's.</i>

1694
02:11:56,907 --> 02:12:00,544
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

1695
02:12:00,611 --> 02:12:02,646
<i>You think God will forgive me?</i>

1696
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,620
Wait!

1697
02:12:10,422 --> 02:12:11,622
Wait!

1698
02:12:12,457 --> 02:12:13,958
God...

1699
02:12:25,203 --> 02:12:26,837
Cover me!

1700
02:12:34,545 --> 02:12:36,614
Go! Go! Go!

1701
02:12:38,082 --> 02:12:40,785
You don't believe
in God, or a future,

1702
02:12:40,851 --> 02:12:42,953
or anything outside
of your own experience.

1703
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:46,124
<i>The rest is belief.</i>

1704
02:12:46,191 --> 02:12:48,592
And I don't have it.

1705
02:12:48,659 --> 02:12:50,661
Without it, you're not human.

1706
02:12:50,728 --> 02:12:52,264
You're just a madman.

1707
02:12:52,963 --> 02:12:55,032
Or a god.

1708
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,033
<i>Of sorts.</i>

1709
02:12:56,101 --> 02:12:57,135
Like I said.

1710
02:13:00,338 --> 02:13:02,374
Don't. Jesus.

1711
02:13:02,441 --> 02:13:03,874
Our time is up.

1712
02:13:10,415 --> 02:13:12,850
I'll give your love to my wife.

1713
02:13:12,917 --> 02:13:15,387
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

1714
02:13:15,454 --> 02:13:16,488
<i>That's right.</i>

1715
02:13:16,555 --> 02:13:18,123
After you meet her, she dies.

1716
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:20,958
<i>I'll just give her
my love instead.</i>

1717
02:13:22,194 --> 02:13:23,095
Don't do...

1718
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:26,098
Volkov...

1719
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:41,346
Enough business,
my love.

1720
02:14:08,306 --> 02:14:11,209
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

1721
02:14:13,178 --> 02:14:16,046
But it sounds
terribly important.

1722
02:14:17,948 --> 02:14:19,417
Where are you going?

1723
02:14:19,484 --> 02:14:20,684
Aren't you hot?

1724
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:38,836
What are you doing now?

1725
02:14:38,903 --> 02:14:40,771
I spilled sunscreen.

1726
02:14:40,838 --> 02:14:42,907
- So what?
- Slippery!

1727
02:14:45,976 --> 02:14:47,711
Just come here.

1728
02:14:50,714 --> 02:14:52,150
Turn over.

1729
02:14:52,217 --> 02:14:53,717
You'll like it.

1730
02:15:27,952 --> 02:15:30,288
I can't do this.

1731
02:15:30,355 --> 02:15:32,657
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

1732
02:15:32,723 --> 02:15:35,759
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

1733
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:39,797
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1734
02:15:39,863 --> 02:15:41,132
Come on, come on,
come on!

1735
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:43,901
Tunnel's sealed,
gate's closed.

1736
02:15:43,968 --> 02:15:46,070
Mahir, do you copy?

1737
02:15:46,137 --> 02:15:46,971
Yeah.

1738
02:15:47,037 --> 02:15:49,006
<i>Hold. I repeat, hold!</i>

1739
02:15:54,279 --> 02:15:55,313
Look in my eyes.

1740
02:15:56,747 --> 02:15:58,316
Which do you see?

1741
02:15:59,417 --> 02:16:02,354
Despair or anger?

1742
02:16:03,622 --> 02:16:05,789
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

1743
02:16:05,856 --> 02:16:08,025
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

1744
02:16:09,461 --> 02:16:13,531
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

1745
02:16:16,701 --> 02:16:17,901
No!

1746
02:16:36,854 --> 02:16:38,956
Shit.

1747
02:16:39,023 --> 02:16:41,159
<i>Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.</i>

1748
02:16:41,226 --> 02:16:44,296
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

1749
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:05,216
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

1750
02:17:09,621 --> 02:17:10,954
Ah, screw it.

1751
02:18:21,326 --> 02:18:24,027
<i>Kat!
You jumped the gun!</i>

1752
02:18:24,095 --> 02:18:25,896
I couldn't do it.

1753
02:18:25,963 --> 02:18:28,065
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

1754
02:18:28,133 --> 02:18:30,934
I knew you'd find a way.

1755
02:18:31,001 --> 02:18:32,936
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

1756
02:18:33,003 --> 02:18:35,106
<i>Yeah, found a way. Be safe.</i>

1757
02:18:56,895 --> 02:18:58,530
Thought you were inverted.

1758
02:18:58,596 --> 02:19:00,365
Changed gears halfway.

1759
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:03,401
Looked like you
needed help here.

1760
02:19:03,468 --> 02:19:05,969
Here?
We needed help down there.

1761
02:19:07,004 --> 02:19:09,140
How'd you get that lock open?

1762
02:19:09,207 --> 02:19:11,476
Wasn't me.
Didn't your team need you?

1763
02:19:12,377 --> 02:19:14,312
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

1764
02:19:14,945 --> 02:19:16,381
All right, Ives?

1765
02:19:16,448 --> 02:19:18,349
Once I've caught my breath.

1766
02:19:32,330 --> 02:19:35,032
No one who's seen this
leaves the field.

1767
02:19:43,741 --> 02:19:45,343
All right.

1768
02:19:48,746 --> 02:19:50,248
We hide it.

1769
02:19:50,949 --> 02:19:53,084
We end our lives.

1770
02:19:53,151 --> 02:19:55,520
That's the only way to be sure.

1771
02:19:57,121 --> 02:19:59,290
As to when...

1772
02:19:59,357 --> 02:20:02,059
maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.

1773
02:20:02,961 --> 02:20:04,262
You're not gonna kill us?

1774
02:20:04,329 --> 02:20:06,898
If I ever find you, I will.

1775
02:20:06,965 --> 02:20:08,533
But you won't look too hard?

1776
02:20:09,567 --> 02:20:10,702
Yes, I will.

1777
02:20:14,339 --> 02:20:16,574
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

1778
02:20:16,641 --> 02:20:17,375
No.

1779
02:20:17,442 --> 02:20:19,277
It's far too dangerous.

1780
02:20:19,944 --> 02:20:21,613
Even from afar?

1781
02:20:22,814 --> 02:20:24,349
Even from afar.

1782
02:20:26,584 --> 02:20:27,719
Ives!

1783
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:30,121
Wait.

1784
02:20:36,194 --> 02:20:37,795
Are you really going back in?

1785
02:20:40,298 --> 02:20:43,601
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

1786
02:20:43,668 --> 02:20:46,437
Well, I don't know any
locksmiths as good as you.

1787
02:20:47,805 --> 02:20:49,607
See?

1788
02:20:49,674 --> 02:20:51,776
It's me in there, again.

1789
02:20:51,843 --> 02:20:55,179
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

1790
02:21:03,655 --> 02:21:04,522
Neil, wait!

1791
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:10,995
Just saved the world.

1792
02:21:11,061 --> 02:21:13,364
Can't leave anything to chance.

1793
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:16,301
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

1794
02:21:16,367 --> 02:21:18,603
"What's happened's happened."

1795
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:22,340
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

1796
02:21:22,407 --> 02:21:24,242
It's not an excuse
to do nothing.

1797
02:21:24,709 --> 02:21:25,643
Fate?

1798
02:21:25,710 --> 02:21:27,278
Call it what you want.

1799
02:21:27,345 --> 02:21:28,546
What do you call it?

1800
02:21:29,447 --> 02:21:30,548
Reality.

1801
02:21:33,084 --> 02:21:34,519
Now let me go.

1802
02:21:39,891 --> 02:21:42,794
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

1803
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:44,629
Haven't you guessed by now?

1804
02:21:45,630 --> 02:21:47,131
You did.

1805
02:21:47,198 --> 02:21:49,901
Only not when you thought.

1806
02:21:49,968 --> 02:21:52,303
You have a future in the past.

1807
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:55,540
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

1808
02:21:56,374 --> 02:21:58,109
You've known me for years?

1809
02:21:59,611 --> 02:22:03,481
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1810
02:22:03,548 --> 02:22:06,085
But for me,
it's just the beginning.

1811
02:22:06,150 --> 02:22:08,353
We get up to some stuff.

1812
02:22:08,419 --> 02:22:11,623
You're gonna love it.
You'll see.

1813
02:22:11,689 --> 02:22:14,292
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

1814
02:22:14,759 --> 02:22:16,160
Whose?

1815
02:22:17,528 --> 02:22:19,098
Yours!

1816
02:22:19,163 --> 02:22:20,665
You're only halfway there.

1817
02:22:20,732 --> 02:22:22,767
I'll see you
at the beginning, friend.

1818
02:22:31,209 --> 02:22:34,612
<i>We're the people saving the
world from what might have been.</i>

1819
02:22:34,679 --> 02:22:36,614
<i>World will never know
what could've happened.</i>

1820
02:22:38,483 --> 02:22:41,519
<i>And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.</i>

1821
02:22:45,356 --> 02:22:48,159
<i>'Cause no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.</i>

1822
02:22:48,926 --> 02:22:50,762
<i>Only the one that did.</i>

1823
02:22:53,264 --> 02:22:54,399
Do it before the boy comes out.

1824
02:22:57,136 --> 02:23:00,438
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

1825
02:23:00,505 --> 02:23:04,075
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

1826
02:23:04,143 --> 02:23:06,244
Here, today.

1827
02:23:07,345 --> 02:23:10,581
How did you know?

1828
02:23:10,648 --> 02:23:14,052
<i>Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...</i>

1829
02:23:14,119 --> 02:23:15,420
Posterity.

1830
02:23:15,486 --> 02:23:19,091
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1831
02:23:19,158 --> 02:23:22,927
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

1832
02:23:22,994 --> 02:23:26,064
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

1833
02:23:26,131 --> 02:23:27,265
Then whose was it?

1834
02:23:27,331 --> 02:23:29,233
Mine.

1835
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:32,770
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

1836
02:23:32,837 --> 02:23:34,706
I'm the protagonist.

1837
02:23:36,941 --> 02:23:40,278
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

1838
02:23:43,047 --> 02:23:44,582
Mission accomplished.

1839
02:23:46,451 --> 02:23:48,686
<i>It's the bomb that
didn't go off.</i>

1840
02:23:48,753 --> 02:23:51,522
<i>The danger no one knew
was real.</i>

1841
02:23:56,561 --> 02:23:59,831
<i>That's the bomb with the real
power to change the world.</i>

1842
02:24:10,355 --> 02:24:15,355
