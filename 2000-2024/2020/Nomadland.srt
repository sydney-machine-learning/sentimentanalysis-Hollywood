I'm on the Amazon
CamperForce list.

12
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:15,797
Oh.

13
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,534
Try M‐C‐D.

14
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,102
- There it is.
- Yeah.

00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,449
Hmm...

16
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,433
Good morning, everybody.

17
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,268
How's everybody doing today?

18
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,772
All right,
let me get a safety tip.

19
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:33,341
- Three‐point contact.
- Why is it important

20
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,943
to maintain
three points of contact?

21
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,644
So you don't fall
down the stairs.

22
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,747
So you don't
fall down the stairs.

23
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,549
Can I get a standard
work tip from you?

24
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:44,786
He's an oddball, right?
Ed? He's an oddball.

25
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:48,790
That's not even
long enough.

26
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,058
Now, okay...

27
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:53,161
Some plastic...

28
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,868
- This is Carl.
- Hi.

29
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,303
- This is Angela.
- Hey.

30
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:03,839
- Doug.
- Hi, Fern.

31
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:06,241
- Ryan. Teresa.
- Hey, Fern.

32
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:07,676
- Karie.
- Good to meet you.

33
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,244
And your
good ol' friend...

34
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:10,879
...Linda May.
And I'm Fern.

35
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,180
- This is my friend Fern.
- Hey.

36
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,982
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, how're you, Fern?

37
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,317
Another Smith lyric
I have is,

38
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:18,920
"When you're laughing and
dancing, and finally living,

39
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:20,756
"you hear my voice in your
head and think of me kindly."

40
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,759
And then also the one that
means the most to me is,

41
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,093
"Home, is it just a word?

42
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,862
"Or is it something that
you carry within you?"

43
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:28,229
- All right.
- So...

44
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,931
- Yeah, we like that.
- I like that one.

45
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,166
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

46
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,633
Like,
his lyrics are very deep.

47
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,538
- And then you also have...
- Yeah.

48
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,490
Ah!

49
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,858
- Yes?
- No.

50
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:58,593
So, the guy
that had the van before,

51
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,795
he just had a mattress
in the back,

52
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,229
but I didn't wanna
keep it that way.

53
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:02,097
I wanted to
build the bed up

54
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,832
so I could have
storage underneath.

55
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:06,401
And I got these
storage drawers,

56
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:07,602
one set in the front

57
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,705
so I could get in them
from the inside,

58
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:11,973
and then another
on the outside.

59
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,175
- Very smart.
- I thought so.

60
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,212
You see that?

61
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:18,847
What is this?

62
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,315
This is my husband's
old fishing box.

63
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:22,951
I put this little latch on
it, and then when I open it,

64
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,553
the stopper holds it
and creates

65
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:27,022
- more counterspace.
- Ah...

66
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,725
And then I keep my
really nice stuff inside.

67
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,760
My dishes that my dad gave me.

68
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:34,730
He collected these,
Linda May, from yard sales,

69
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:36,364
and when I graduated
from high school,

70
00:07:36,397 --> 00:07:38,299
- he gave me the whole set.
- Oh!

71
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,601
- They are beautiful.
- Isn't that great?

72
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,904
Yeah, it's called
Autumn Leaf.

73
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:45,340
I don't have that many pieces
with me, but you know.

74
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:47,809
What did you name your van?

75
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,245
Vanguard.

76
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh, that is
very strong.

77
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,349
She is. Mmm.

78
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,498
Hey. Hey.

79
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,701
Hey, what are you doing?

80
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,540
<i>...the bears held</i>

Hey, Brandy.

88
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:53,809
- Oh, hi, Fern.
- Hi, kids.

- Say hi to Mrs. M.

90
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,644
How are you?

91
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:58,179
- I'm good.
- Good.

92
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,215
It's nice to see you.
It's been a while.

93
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,783
- How've you been?
- Good.

94
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,151
- Good. You look good.
- Thanks.

95
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:04,920
- You cut your hair.
- Yeah, I cut it.

96
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,621
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Thank you.

97
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:07,689
Are you working
at Amazon again?

98
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,390
- Yeah, I am.
- You like it?

99
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,591
Uh, yeah. Great money.

100
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,794
Are you still doing
the van thing?

101
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,897
Yeah. I'm parked over at
the Desert Rose R. V. Park.

102
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,199
Oh, we just drove
by there today.

103
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,067
Didn't we, girls?

104
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,601
- How's your mom?
- She's wonderful.

105
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,203
She misses you
a lot.

106
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:23,638
Please tell her
I miss her, too.

107
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,407
I will. I will.
But really, Fern,

108
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,009
if you need
a place to stay,

109
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,911
you can come over
and stay with us.

110
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,179
We're worried
about you.

111
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:32,981
Thanks.
Don't worry about me.

112
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,783
I'll let you know.
I promise.

113
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,117
Okay. Okay.

114
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:38,086
- See you, Aubrey.
- Bye.

115
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,024
Hey.

116
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:45,193
- Hey.
- Hi.

117
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:47,562
You still the smartest
kid in school?

118
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,698
- Yeah, kinda.
- Mmm‐hmm.

119
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,701
You remember anything that we
worked on when I tutored ya?

120
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,169
Uh...

121
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,871
Yes.

122
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:58,439

tomorrow, and tomorrow.

125
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:06,581
That's really good.

126
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

127
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:09,985
Um...

128
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:12,954
My mom says that you're homeless.
Is that true?

129
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,290
No, I'm not homeless.

130
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,759
I'm just houseless.

131
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,227
Not the same thing, right?

132
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,161
No.

133
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,562
Don't worry about me.
I'm okay.

134
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:22,798
Okay.

00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:28,937

<i>So come on in and find...</i>

139
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,991
Before I moved
into the Squeeze Inn,

140
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,929
I was out looking for work
and putting in applications...

141
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:57,065
2008, and it was just tough.

142
00:10:57,098 --> 00:11:02,503
And I got to a really,
really low point.

143
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,308
And I thought about suicide,
and I decided

144
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:10,511
I was gonna go buy
a bottle of booze,

145
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,314
turn on the propane stove...

146
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,486
and I was gonna drink that
booze until I passed out.

147
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,321
And if I woke up...

148
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:22,891
I was gonna light a cigarette,

149
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,993
and I was gonna
blow us all up.

150
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:29,097
And I looked at my two sweet
little trusting dogs,

151
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,068
my Cocker Spaniel
and my little Toy Poodle,

152
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:37,338
and I just couldn't
do that to them.

153
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:40,041
And I thought, well,

154
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,110
I can't do that to me, either.

155
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:46,014
So, I was
getting close to 62

156
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,752
and I went online to look
at my social security benefit.

157
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:53,454
It said $550.

158
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,326
Fern, I had worked
my whole life.

159
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,729
I'd worked since
I was 12 years old,

160
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,431
raised two daughters.
I couldn't believe it.

161
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,133
So I'm online,

162
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,536
and I find Bob Wells
Cheap RV Living.

163
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,772
I could live in an RV,

164
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:12,307
travel

165
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,044
and not have to work
for the rest of my life.

166
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:21,817
<i>The RTR is a bootcamp
for beginner nomads.</i>

167
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,786
Bob Wells looks
just like Santa Claus.

168
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,854
Doesn't he?

169
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,723
Everybody says that.

170
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,557
What's RTR
stand for?

171
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,359
Rubber Tramp Rendezvous.

172
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:34,162
It is in
Quartzsite, Arizona,

173
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:37,065
out in the middle
of the desert, on BLM land.

174
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,133
You should come.

175
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,267
I'm gonna make you
a map.

176
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,336
No, I don't think
I'm gonna go.

177
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,838
Oh, I hope you come.

178
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:44,239
I'm gonna make you
a map anyway.

179
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,975
<i>So,
that's what the RTR is.</i>

180
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:49,811
<i>It is a support system
for people</i>

181
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:53,014
<i>who need help now.</i>

182
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:11,666
See you next year, Fern.
Happy holidays.

183
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,234
Yeah, you, too, Doug.

184
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,638
Carl had
a stroke.

185
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:52,040
- Is he dead?
- No.

186
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:55,911
No, no. His daughter came
and took him back East.

187
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,245
- Oh.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,613
But they didn't
take the dog?

189
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:00,115
They couldn't take him.

190
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:01,983
Would you like
to have him?

191
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:03,318
- Uh...
- He's really a good dog.

192
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:05,153
- No. No.
- He's real friendly.

193
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:09,490
Okay, so you are leaving
on Thursday, right?

194
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:10,992
- Yeah.
- Okay. Um...

195
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:13,361
I just finished
Amazon yesterday.

196
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,865
Okay. Amazon pays
through Thursday.

197
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,301
And then after that,
it's $375 a month.

198
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,303
Well, is there a discount

199
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,372
if I don't use
the electric and dump,

200
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,807
'cause I just have
my van, you know?

201
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:29,344
No, but since you're in a
van, it's easy for you to move

202
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,713
and to go south
to a warmer place.

203
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,315
Yeah, but I wanted to get
a job around here first.

204
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,984
Oh. Good luck with that.

205
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:38,720
- Mmm. Mmm‐hmm.
- That's tough.

206
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,156
- Bye, Patty.
- Bye, Fern.

207
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:42,523
We'll see you next year.

208
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,359
<i>Thank you. Have a nice day.</i>

209
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,284
My husband worked
at the USG mine in Empire

210
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:10,986
and I worked
in human resources there

211
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,120
for a few years.

212
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:13,488
That was
my last full‐time job.

213
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,856
I did a lot of
part‐time jobs.

214
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,524
I cashiered
at the Empire Store.

215
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:19,327
I was a substitute teacher at
the school for five years...

216
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,796
Didn't the Empire Mine
shut down

217
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:23,498
and then all of the resident
workers had to relocate?

218
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,034
- Yeah, about a year ago.
- Wow.

219
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,636
So, when do you need
to get back to work?

220
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:30,338
Now?

221
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,742
It is a tough time
right now.

222
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,576
You may want
to consider

223
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,813
registering for
early retirement.

224
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:41,416
I don't think I can get by
on the benefits, and, um...

225
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,588
I need work. I like work.

226
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:51,459
I'm not sure exactly what
you would be eligible for.

227
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,301
- Hi, there.
- Hi!

228
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,838
I'm Rachel.
I'm the manager here at Fox Peak.

229
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:03,905
Hi, I'm Fern.

230
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,140
Hi, Fern.

231
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,711
Um, I asked someone, they said
I could park here overnight.

232
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,612
Oh, you're fine.
You're more than welcome.

233
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,515
But you know,
the temperature is gonna drop.

234
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,051
It gets really cold
here at night.

235
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,953
- Yeah, I know. I can tell.
- Really cold.

236
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,120
Yeah.

237
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,556
I don't want to overstep
my bounds here.

238
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,726
There is a church
down by 7‐Eleven.

239
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,029
It's a Baptist church,
and they do have open beds.

240
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:29,530
I'm gonna be good.

241
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:32,768
Okay. Okay. We're here
if you need anything.

242
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,302
Thank you.

243
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,955
Mmm.

244
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,788
Linda? Linda?

245
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:33,822
Hey.

246
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,225
Shh.

247
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:38,626
So glad you came.

248
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:43,631
- That's Bob Wells.
- Sit here. Keep the chair.

249
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,866
Thank you.

250
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:48,236
And the odd thing
is that we...

251
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:51,472
We not only accept
the tyranny of the dollar,

252
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,041
the tyranny
of the marketplace,

253
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:54,509
we embrace it.

254
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,644
We gladly throw the yoke

255
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,447
of the tyranny
of the dollar on

256
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,183
and live by it
our whole lives.

257
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:05,386
I think of an analogy
as a workhorse.

258
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,456
The workhorse that is willing
to work itself to death

259
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,358
and then be
put out to pasture.

260
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,961
And that's what happens
to so many of us.

261
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,629
If society
was throwing us away

262
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:17,232
and sending us, the workhorse,
out to the pasture,

263
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,200
we workhorses
had to gather together

264
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:20,335
and take care
of each other.

265
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,637
And that's what
this is all about.

266
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,473
The way I see it is that
the Titanic is sinking

267
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:27,776
and economic times
are changing.

268
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,646
And so my goal is
to get the lifeboats out

269
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,049
and get as many people
into the lifeboats as I can.

270
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,917
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's plenty.

271
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,218
Yeah. We got plenty.
Jump and shout.

272
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:38,286
How many vegans
we got here?

273
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,688
Let you know, huh?

274
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,022
- What's that?
- Vegan.

275
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,223
This is vegan.

276
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,425
- No, I'm... I'm a carnivore.
- Yeah.

277
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,626
- Okay.
- Thank you. Yes.

278
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,862
Okay. Thank you,
though.

279
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,296
- Looks good.
- Another carnivore?

280
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,831
- She's a carnivore.
- Okay.

281
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:50,899
Mac 'n' cheese.

282
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,100
Just tell me when?

283
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:54,435
You good? More?

284
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:57,072
Oh! She likes
the red peppers.

285
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,573
- Cilantro?
- No!

286
00:19:58,606 --> 00:19:59,540
No!

287
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,809
No! No, no.

288
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:09,484
I'm a Vietnam vet.

289
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:12,587
And, um, I got PTSD.

290
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,157
I really can't handle
loud noises,

291
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:19,160
uh, big crowds, fireworks.

292
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:23,198
I got a pickup truck
and a camper.

293
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,766
I can live out here...

294
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,969
and be at peace.

295
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:34,242
I had, um,
finally convinced my grandpa,

296
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,377
and my papa, and my mama,

297
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:38,479
that we should

298
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:42,017
take off in an RV
and see the country.

299
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:46,154
But then both of them were
told that they had cancer,

300
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,890
they passed away
three weeks apart.

301
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:50,591
I began watching

302
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:55,230
Bob Wells' videos
on van‐dwelling.

303
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:56,932
Then I bought my van...

304
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,301
Paint, because she takes me
where I ain't.

305
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:02,503
And

306
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:06,742
started my healing journey
two and a half years ago.

307
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:08,977
Um, I worked
for corporate America,

308
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,411
you know, for 20 years.

309
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:13,915
And my friend, Bill,
worked for the same company,

310
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:17,886
and he had liver failure.

311
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,588
A week before
he was due to retire,

312
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:25,626
HR called him in hospice,
and said...

313
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,296
"Let's talk about
your retirement."

314
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,032
And he died 10 days later,

315
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:35,370
having never been able
to take that sailboat

316
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:38,606
that he bought
out of his driveway.

317
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:42,277
And he missed out
on everything.

318
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,379
And he told me
before he died,

319
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,214
"Just don't waste
any time, Merle.

320
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:47,683
"Don't waste any time."

321
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:50,118
So I retired
as soon as I could.

322
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:51,286
I didn't want
my sailboat

323
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,689
to be in the driveway
when I died...

324
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:57,693
so, yeah...

325
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,295
And it's not.

326
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,663
My sailboat's out here
in the desert.

327
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,910
I can't imagine
what you're going through,

328
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:17,913
the loss of your husband,

329
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:20,982
and the loss of your whole
town, and friends,

330
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:22,617
and village,

331
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,455
and that kind of loss
is never easy.

332
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:30,458
And I wish I had
an easy answer for you.

333
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:32,127
But I think you've come
to the right place

334
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,261
to find an answer.

335
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:35,363
I think that...

336
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,465
I think connecting to nature

337
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:40,802
and to a real true community
and tribe,

338
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:42,537
will make all the difference
for you.

339
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:45,673
I hope so.

340
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,532
Hey, Fern.

341
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,768
Hey, Linda.

342
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,135
Come over and join us.

343
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:15,904
No, I'm just gonna
take a little walk.

344
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,673
- Okay.
- Be back soon.

345
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:24,239
Hey. Good morning...

346
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:26,674
- Bob.
- Morning.

347
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,429
One of the questions
that I get all the time is,

348
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:49,564
"Bob, I have to live
in the city.

349
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,299
"I'd like to be out here,
but I can't.

350
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:54,836
"How can I avoid the
famous knock on the door?"

351
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,237
So, I've developed what I call

352
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,740
the Ten Commandments
of Stealth Parking.

353
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,082
Stop being so quiet.

354
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:09,384
And then, in and out.
Just make...

355
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,752
You gotta make
the hole bigger

356
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:12,287
so the rope fits.

357
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,589
Very... Yeah. That's it.
That's perfect.

358
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:18,293
- Oh, my God. Ladies.
- Then you go...

359
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:23,965
I love this lifestyle.
It is a lifestyle of freedom

360
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,534
and beauty,
and connection to the Earth.

361
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,170
Yet there is a trade‐off.

362
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:32,207
You gotta learn how to
take care of your own shit.

363
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:37,612
Most of us, in this lifestyle,
use a five‐gallon bucket.

364
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:41,582
Most of us are in vans
or something larger.

365
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:44,019
I'm in a Prius,

366
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:46,554
so I use a two‐gallon bucket.

367
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,622
If you have bad knees,

368
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:48,757
you could use
a seven‐gallon bucket.

369
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,394
- Hi, Fern.
- Hi, guys.

370
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:01,569
- Got these for you.
- Thank you. These are nice.

371
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,738
Yeah.

372
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,072
She always has
some nice appliances.

373
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,509
Here, you should
take this one.

374
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:10,145
That one's kind of funky.

375
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,947
Oh. These yours?

376
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,283
Yeah.
There's a black hole in every van.

377
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:18,787
Specially mine. One time I had
seven of these can openers.

378
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,555
Doesn't happen to me.

379
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:23,191
Trade you for a potholder.
I make 'em.

380
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:26,261
Okay, sure. Wow.
What is this? Crochet?

381
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,395
No. Something different.

382
00:26:29,364 --> 00:26:31,199
- Nice.
- Wow, that is nice.

383
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,067
- Yeah.
- Wow.

384
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,601
Uh‐uh‐uh.
It's going home with me.

385
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,203
Okay.

386
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:36,471
See ya.

387
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:38,039
- Thank you.
- Yep.

388
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,452
Seems like the work is
not gonna be horrible.

389
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,521
Uh‐oh, uh‐oh,
it's sliding.

390
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:56,424
- Do you take resumes?
- Um...

391
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:58,526
I'll leave it with
you, just in case.

392
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,362
- No. Just go on...
- Go online?

393
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,563
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

394
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:04,465
I got a four‐pack
for $100.

395
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,834
Just like that.

396
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,803
Whoa!

397
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,870
Did you feel it?

398
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:10,171
That's what
it does to people.

399
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:12,240
- It scared me.
- It scares them away.

400
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:14,575
You guys know how much
money is sitting here?

401
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:17,445
It's like they're,
uh, dinosaurs.

402
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:22,083
Nope. Watch out, watch out.

403
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:23,551
Watch the steps.

404
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:24,619
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

405
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:25,687
Whoa.

406
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:28,189
- Whoa.
- It's like a disco.

407
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,925
Oh, my gosh.

408
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:33,561
Oh, the lighting
is beautiful.

409
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:36,597
- Washer and dryer.
- Oh, my gosh.

410
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:39,000
You're kidding.
Oh, man.

411
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,070
Okay, ladies,
where are we going?

412
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:43,504
- Hawaii.
- No, no.

413
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,439
Well, yeah.

414
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,908
Well, there's water
between here and there.

415
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:48,710
Let's not go
to the East Coast.

416
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,311
There's no place big
enough over there

417
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:52,480
to park something this size.

418
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:53,882
This is a magic bus.

419
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,917
We could go to Hawaii.

420
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,285
Okay. Hawaii.

- How's it going, Ron?
- Noodle.

Ron, look.

482
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,993
Hello, ma'am.

Yeah, sure.

Well, sure.
Thank you.

- Fern.
- Fern, Derek.

Hi, Derek.

- Nice to meet you.

What?

495
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:20,776
What?

496
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:23,178
It's Fern, it's Fern, Swankie.
It's Fern.

497
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:27,482
- Hey. Hi.
- Didn't you see the flag?

498
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:28,950
- Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.
- It means

499
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:30,986
- I don't wanna be disturbed.
- I know.

500
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,487
I need a ride to town.

501
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,588
Why?

502
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:35,256
I blew my tire.

503
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,858
Well, go change it.

504
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,059
I don't have
a spare.

505
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:39,394
You don't have a spare?

506
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:41,362
You're out in the boondocks
and you don't have a spare?

507
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,970
You can die out here.
You're out in the wilderness,

508
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,405
far away from anybody.

509
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:52,440
You can die out here.
Don't you understand that?

510
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:53,574
You have to
take it seriously.

511
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:55,110
You have to have
a way to get help.

512
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:57,078
You have to be able
to change your own tire.

513
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,479
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Swankie.

514
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:00,148
All right.

515
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:02,283
You can...
You can pay me back.

516
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:04,920
I'm gonna go on this trip.
I'm getting ready to leave.

517
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:06,087
I got a lot to do.

518
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:07,322
I can't get it all
done fast enough.

519
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:08,389
Yeah, sure.
I owe ya. I owe ya.

520
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,524
You can help me
finish things up.

521
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:11,259
- I really appreciate it.
- You got it.

522
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,694
Here's what I suggest.

523
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:14,262
Don't get AAA, okay?

524
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:15,864
You gotta get something
like a SPOT device.

525
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:17,265
A satellite
tracking device.

526
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:18,666
We need to soak
the sandpaper.

527
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,368
- It's called wet and dry.
- Mmm‐hmm.

528
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:21,870
We need it
to be wet.

529
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:22,971
Ready?

530
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:26,274
Ready. Yep.

531
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,409
Now we need to mask
the fender off,

532
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,846
because white paint will
land on the fender, too.

533
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,480
Put plastic over this.

534
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:33,849
All right, let me just say

535
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:36,351
that this is a lot more
complicated than I thought.

536
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,585
Oh, it's very,
very complicated.

537
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,020
- Uh‐huh.
- And it's taking me

538
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:43,291
a long time to patch all the
peeling paint on this van.

539
00:34:43,324 --> 00:34:45,126
- So are you quitting on me?
- Okay.

540
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,062
No, no,
I'm not quitting.

541
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:48,363
When we get done
with all this,

542
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,731
I'm gonna give you
all my paint.

543
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,299
I don't want to take
any more of it with me,

544
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:54,970
you can have it all 'cause
your van looks kind of...

545
00:34:55,904 --> 00:34:57,005
ratty.

546
00:34:57,038 --> 00:34:58,740
No, it doesn't.

547
00:34:58,774 --> 00:35:01,109
She does not.
She just needs a wash.

548
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,779
No. You take my paint.

549
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:23,264
Ratty.

550
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:12,347
Ugh. Ugh.

551
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:18,920
Fern. It's Swankie.

552
00:36:18,954 --> 00:36:21,156
What? I'm indisposed.

553
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:22,557
Where did I get
all this stuff?

554
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,525
- Yeah? Well, it adds up.
- Where'd it come from?

555
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,294
I just put on Facebook,

556
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:27,896
Quartzsite Chatter,
the other day

557
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:29,430
that I was givin'
all this stuff away

558
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:31,499
and I asked people
to come get it.

559
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,101
So, I'm hopin'
they do.

560
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,070
I love this.

561
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,204
Take it.

562
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,239
- You kidding?
- It's yours.

563
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:39,540
Whoa, that's nice.

564
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:40,842
You look really good
in that chair.

565
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:44,312
And that's called
red, white, and blue jasper.

566
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,380
What's that?

567
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,349
That's petrified palm wood.

568
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:51,619
And that's part of
the same...

569
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:54,089
- rock, and, uh...
- Mmm‐hmm.

570
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:55,290
Ouch!

571
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:56,424
Um...

572
00:36:56,457 --> 00:36:57,993
- Careful, your arm.
- That's another one

573
00:36:58,026 --> 00:36:59,861
of the red,
white, and blue.

574
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:04,532
- What's going on? What?
- I don't feel very good.

575
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,601
- I got a headache.
- Hey.

576
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:08,937
Here. Sit down.

577
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,108
Got it?

578
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,212
What's goin' on?
What do you need?

579
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:18,479
My head hurts really,
really bad

580
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:20,348
and I'm nauseated.

581
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,750
Water'll help?
Would water help?

582
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:22,818
Oh, yeah.

583
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,487
- Oh, boy.
- Here.

584
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:29,858
Careful, your arm.

585
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:40,135
<i>Mrs. McQuarry
reminded me of someone.</i>

586
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,742
- You all right?
- Mmm‐hmm.

587
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,543
I...

588
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:50,645
I guess I'm all right.

589
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:01,990
You okay?

590
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:05,593
Um...

591
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:07,628
Doctors told me that...

592
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:11,232
Well, I had cancer removed
from my lung a while back

593
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:14,569
and, small cell carcinoma.

594
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:18,006
And they told me
it's spread to my brain.

595
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:21,642
And they've only given me
seven or eight months to live.

596
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,812
I'm sorry.

597
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:25,847
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:27,315
I'm gonna

599
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,784
take my trip.

600
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:30,551
I'm gonna go back
to Alaska again,

601
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:32,253
because of some good memories.

602
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:33,922
And, um,

603
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,992
just do
what I have to do.

604
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,561
I have this book called
Final Exitby Dr. Kevorkian.

605
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:42,698
Some people call him
Dr. Death.

606
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:45,100
And it's like,
various ways

607
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,836
that you can end your
life if you need to.

608
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:48,904
And, um,

609
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:51,039
it's kind of like a recipe.

610
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:54,309
I have it, if I have to fall
back on it for some ideas,

611
00:38:54,342 --> 00:38:57,012
but I'm not gonna
spend any more time

612
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,014
indoors in a hospital.

613
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:00,982
No, thanks.

614
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,757
I'm gonna be 75
this year

615
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,959
and I think I've lived
a pretty good life.

616
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:13,161
I've seen some
really neat things,

617
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:15,330
kayaking, all those places.

618
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:18,666
And, you know,
moose in the wild.

619
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,270
A moose family
on a river in Idaho.

620
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:23,571
Um...

621
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:26,708
And big,
white pelicans landin'

622
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,409
just six feet over my kayak

623
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:30,245
on a lake in Colorado.

624
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:31,980
Or, uh...

625
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:36,117
um, come around a bend,
was a cliff,

626
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:38,653
and find hundreds and hundreds
of swallow nests

627
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,055
on the wall of the cliff.

628
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:42,657
And the swallows
flyin' all around.

629
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:44,793
And reflecting in the water

630
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:47,328
so it looks like I'm flying
with the swallows

631
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:48,663
and they're under me,
and over me,

632
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:49,798
and all around me.

633
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:51,933
And the little babies
are hatchin' out

634
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:53,735
and egg shells are fallin' out
of the nests,

635
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,104
landin' on the water
and floatin' on the water.

636
00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:57,438
These little white shells.

637
00:39:57,472 --> 00:39:59,574
It's like, well,
it's just so awesome.

638
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,510
I felt like I'd done enough.
My life was complete.

639
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:05,213
If I died right then,
that moment,

640
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:06,614
it'd be perfectly fine.

641
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,736
I don't know.
Maybe when I die,

642
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:29,938
my friends will gather
around the fire

643
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:33,074
and toss a rock into the fire
in memory of me.

644
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:41,750
Oh, I see somethin' neat.

645
00:40:53,594 --> 00:40:56,597
Here we go.
And then pull it up

646
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:58,233
and close it up.

647
00:40:58,266 --> 00:40:59,300
- How's that?
- Oh.

648
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:02,938
Oh! Look at this.

649
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,348
My grandmother made that
for me, and gave it to me.

650
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:15,550
So, enjoy.
Take good care of it.

651
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,819
- Thank you.
- Bye.

652
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,625
Can I tell you
somethin', Swankie?

653
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:31,893
What?

654
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,796
Been thinkin' a lot
about my husband Bo.

655
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,964
When it got really bad
at the end,

656
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:37,298
they had him
in the hospital

657
00:42:37,332 --> 00:42:39,167
on morphine drip

658
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,070
and I would sit there
at night, in the hospital.

659
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:45,841
And...

660
00:42:45,874 --> 00:42:48,810
I'd wanna put my thumb down
on that morphine drip

661
00:42:48,844 --> 00:42:50,812
just a little bit longer...

662
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,315
so I could let him go.

663
00:42:55,183 --> 00:42:58,153
Maybe I should have
tried harder

664
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:03,224
so he could have gone sooner
without all that pain.

665
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:06,261
Well, maybe he wouldn't have
wanted that.

666
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:09,064
Maybe he was tryin' to stay
with you as long as he could.

667
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:13,101
I'm sure you took
good care of him, Fern.

668
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:16,437
I did.

669
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,979
Bye, Fern.

670
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:59,014

685
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:52,220
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi, there.

686
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:53,989
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, sure.

687
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,124
- It's just black, so...
- Ah, that's good.

688
00:46:58,459 --> 00:47:00,295
Hello. Coffee?

689
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:08,369
- I know you.
- Yeah, hi. Dave. Right?

690
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:09,738
Guess.

691
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:11,139
- Fern.
- Yes.

692
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:13,008
I have your
can opener.

693
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,176
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you do.

694
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,912
Are you working
here now or...

695
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:18,146
Yeah, first year.

696
00:47:19,014 --> 00:47:20,648
So, coffee?

697
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:23,051
Uh...
Yeah, sure.

698
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:28,323
- Yeah.
- That's good.

699
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:31,827
Black, so...

700
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,928
If you want
anything in it,

701
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:34,295
you gotta put it in.
So, see ya.

702
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:36,431
- Yeah. Have a good day.
- I'm your camp host.

703
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:38,133
One thing you
wanna make sure

704
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,235
that you always do
is put on gloves.

705
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:41,703
You need to protect
your health.

706
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,672
We have people from all
over the world coming here.

707
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:46,842
Give 'em a little puff.

708
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,476
And that's it.

709
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:59,855
The walls, too?
Or just that silver thing?

710
00:47:59,888 --> 00:48:02,290
- Oh, walls, too. Yes.
- Walls, too. Okay.

711
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:05,526
Where do you go
and find scenery like this?

712
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,128
- Right here is where you go.
- Yeah.

713
00:48:07,162 --> 00:48:09,530
- The Badlands.
- The Badlands.

714
00:48:10,431 --> 00:48:12,768
We be the bitches
of the Badlands.

715
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,045
Look. Look.

716
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:30,585
Ew!

717
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:33,855
I don't want those on me. No.

718
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:35,223
Some people.

719
00:48:35,256 --> 00:48:36,992
Oh, that's almost
a whole bag of Doritos.

720
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:39,160
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

721
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:40,796
Hey.

722
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:42,030
Are you
the camp host?

723
00:48:42,063 --> 00:48:43,999
Yeah. I'm Fern.
That's Linda May.

724
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:45,400
- How you guys doin'?
- Good.

725
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:46,735
- I'd shake your hand...
- I'm Victor.

726
00:48:46,768 --> 00:48:47,869
...but you wouldn't.
Not now.

727
00:48:47,903 --> 00:48:49,137
- Yeah.
- You don't wanna touch these.

728
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,505
Well, the power's
out here.

729
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:52,708
We're tryin' to have our
daughter's birthday party.

730
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,744
Is it on?

731
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:57,178
- It's on!
- All right!

732
00:48:57,212 --> 00:48:59,514
Do you want me to tie this
one on your wrist, too?

733
00:48:59,547 --> 00:49:01,549
Oh, no!
The wind's picking up!

734
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:04,219
Oh, my. Oops.

735
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:06,387
Which hand
do you want it on?

736
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:07,789
That one?

737
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:09,424
What beautiful hands.

738
00:49:09,457 --> 00:49:12,193
- Thank you.
- There you go.

739
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:14,595
Welcome to
Badlands Spa.

740
00:49:14,629 --> 00:49:18,299
Can I please have a volunteer
from the audience?

741
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,801
- Pick me.
- Okay.

742
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:26,374
Oh, doesn't that
feel wonderful?

743
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:27,909
What's your name, miss?

744
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:29,677
- Linda.
- Linda.

745
00:49:39,387 --> 00:49:40,889
Hi,
may I help you?

746
00:49:40,922 --> 00:49:42,423
Yes. We're here
for the tour.

747
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:44,592
The tour will be
in about 15 minutes.

748
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,061
Should we wait
right here?

749
00:49:46,094 --> 00:49:47,462
You can wait
if you want, here.

750
00:49:47,495 --> 00:49:49,330
I got a great map of
the local area, here.

751
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:50,999
We have a schedule
of some of the summer

752
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:52,267
- activities right here.
- Hi.

753
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,869
- You can take one.
- Oh, wonderful.

754
00:49:58,106 --> 00:50:00,275
- There you go.
- Okay.

755
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:02,277
This is gonna be
really exciting.

756
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,812
Rub two stones together.

757
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,314
And you'll see
what happens

758
00:50:06,347 --> 00:50:08,649
as they start
to get like sand.

759
00:50:08,684 --> 00:50:12,453
That's why it's so easy
for a paleontologist

760
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:14,055
to find fossils
in here.

761
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:15,290
Why are there holes
in the rocks?

762
00:50:15,323 --> 00:50:17,525
That's a...
That's a very good question.

763
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:20,495
At one time,
there was air inside these rocks.

764
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:23,364
Like little pockets,
little bubbles of gas.

765
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:26,201
And they're trapped
inside the rocks.

766
00:50:26,234 --> 00:50:28,970
That's what makes them
so, uh, breakable.

767
00:51:10,378 --> 00:51:12,714
Hey, hey!

768
00:51:14,015 --> 00:51:15,917
Find anything
interesting?

769
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:18,453
Rocks!

770
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:25,493
Hey, Fern!

771
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:38,606
Hey, Greg.

772
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:40,108
Line that up.

773
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:41,242
<i>Salud!</i>

774
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:42,510
To the earthship.

775
00:51:42,543 --> 00:51:44,479
- To the earthship, Linda May.
- To the earthship.

776
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:46,614
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

777
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:47,683
Thank you.

778
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:52,420
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm‐hmm.

779
00:51:52,453 --> 00:51:54,756
Oh,
makes your voice go high.

780
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,524
Oh, yeah. Mmm!

781
00:51:57,859 --> 00:51:58,960
Okay.

782
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:02,030
This is my land
in Arizona.

783
00:52:02,063 --> 00:52:04,199
I'm gonna build an earthship

784
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:06,567
that's a totally
self‐contained house,

785
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:10,005
built out of tires,
and bottles, and cans.

786
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:11,239
So it has no waste.

787
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:13,809
It in no way harms
the land, this house.

788
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:16,244
- Self‐sufficient?
- Self‐sufficient.

789
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:18,714
It looks like
a living piece of art

790
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:20,648
that you've made with
your own two hands.

791
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:23,651
It's something that I can
leave to my grandchildren.

792
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:27,022
This house would be there
for generations.

793
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:28,924
Outlive us all.

794
00:52:28,957 --> 00:52:30,558
That's a good thing.

795
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:36,064
There. Now we're on.

796
00:52:36,097 --> 00:52:38,133
When you get old,
you get personality.

797
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,868
Yeah.

798
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:42,738
I'm not gonna
see you for a while.

799
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:44,039
But... But...

800
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:48,276
Oh... Oh...

801
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:50,578
You come and see me.

802
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:53,081
You come and stay
as long as you like.

803
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:55,316
- Whenever you like.
- Mmm.

804
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,318
- Okay.
- Thank you.

805
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:59,821
- Oh...
- Thank you, Linda May.

806
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:01,622
Oh, thank you.

807
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,859
You have given me
so much.

808
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:10,598
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

809
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:49,905
Hi, Fern.

810
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,406
Hey.

811
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:54,275
I was at the gas
station, and, uh,

812
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:55,877
and I think it's
better if you don't

813
00:53:55,911 --> 00:53:57,212
drive through the park
when it's dark

814
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:59,314
for your cigarettes,
so I got you these.

815
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:00,415
What are they?

816
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:01,783
Uh, licorice sticks.

817
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:03,518
I can't smoke
licorice sticks, Dave.

818
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:05,754
I know,
but you can chew on these,

819
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:08,757
and, you know,
they help curb the urge.

820
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,325
I'm not gonna
quit smoking, Dave.

821
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:13,294
Yeah, I know,
but you should try these.

822
00:54:13,328 --> 00:54:15,096
They're good for
the digestion, too.

823
00:54:16,097 --> 00:54:17,866
Fine. Thanks.

824
00:54:17,899 --> 00:54:20,568
- What's going on?
- Ants. I've got ants.

825
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:22,070
Oh, ants. They're okay.

826
00:54:22,103 --> 00:54:25,073
No, they're not.
They're in my food, Dave!

827
00:54:25,106 --> 00:54:26,474
I can do it.
Thanks.

828
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:30,311
Where do you want this?

829
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:31,980
Oh...

830
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:36,351
Fern, I'm sorry.

831
00:54:36,384 --> 00:54:37,886
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that...

832
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:39,087
Go over there!

833
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:44,325
You don't have
to shout. Okay?

834
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:45,426
Stay over there.

835
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,661
I'm going.

836
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:25,633
Okay.

837
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:37,779
No, we're closed.

838
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,829
You are
one of those lucky people

839
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:56,131
that is from
the United States.

840
00:55:56,164 --> 00:55:58,466
- Of the US of A.
- Yes.

841
00:55:58,499 --> 00:56:00,568
- Yes, I am.
- And you can travel anywhere.

842
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:01,636
Yes, ma'am.
I know.

843
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:03,972
And they sometimes call you

844
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:05,606
- nomads...
- Yeah.

845
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,575
...or people
who don't have a home.

846
00:56:07,608 --> 00:56:10,278
I see that
you have this ring.

847
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:12,580
- Mmm‐hmm.
- Are you married?

848
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:14,349
I am,

849
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:16,918
but my husband died.

850
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:19,587
And so...

851
00:56:20,455 --> 00:56:21,656
I'm not gonna take that off.

852
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,325
- That ring is a circle.
- Mmm‐hmm.

853
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,795
And it never ends.

854
00:56:26,828 --> 00:56:29,831
And that means that
your love never ends.

855
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:36,171
And you may not be able to
take it off if you tried.

856
00:56:36,204 --> 00:56:37,305
I don't think I could.

857
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:38,339
No.

858
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:07,668
Got a nice setup.
The best one.

859
00:57:20,882 --> 00:57:22,951
He has a case
of diverticulitis.

860
00:57:22,984 --> 00:57:24,853
Which is inflammation
of his intestines.

861
00:57:24,886 --> 00:57:25,721
Uh‐huh.

862
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:27,388
So, earlier
the surgeon went in

863
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:28,690
and did
a laparoscopic surgery.

864
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:30,391
He had surgery?

865
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:31,626
Ooh, Cup Noodles.

866
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,628
Yeah. Well, it's good
for when you're sick.

867
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:36,197
- Wow.
- Animal crackers.

868
00:57:36,231 --> 00:57:37,265
And...

869
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:39,334
for you.

870
00:57:41,636 --> 00:57:42,971
That's my favorite.

871
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:44,105
I know.

872
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:46,274
Thanks, Fern.

873
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:48,944
So, what are you
gonna do next?

874
00:57:48,977 --> 00:57:52,113
Uh, I'm gonna go to the
beet harvest in Nebraska.

875
00:57:52,147 --> 00:57:54,282
Uh, that doesn't start
till October.

876
00:57:54,315 --> 00:57:56,017
How 'bout you?

877
00:57:56,051 --> 00:57:58,286
I'm gonna start in
at Wall Drug.

878
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,620
Yeah, I did that
last year.

879
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:01,857
I can see if they
have another opening.

880
00:58:02,457 --> 00:58:04,259
- For me?
- Yeah.

881
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:06,127
Got a great place
to park.

882
00:58:08,129 --> 00:58:11,399
Enjoy your kippers.
Get better. Bye.

883
00:58:26,447 --> 00:58:28,917
- How's it going?
- Good, good, good.

884
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:31,186
One...

885
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:37,092
- Hey, Michael!
- Hey! How's it goin'?

886
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,794
Good. Can I take
these tomatoes and onions?

887
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:40,095
Yes. Absolutely.

888
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:41,362
Thank you.

889
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:50,872
I don't like it.

890
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:52,273
One up over
the right side there.

891
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,809
Okay.

892
00:58:53,842 --> 00:58:56,144
Please don't let her
face get near me.

893
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:57,779
Oh, sheesh.

894
00:58:57,813 --> 00:59:00,348
- Oh, my gosh.
- Isn't she beautiful?

895
00:59:01,983 --> 00:59:04,986
I'm kinda kidding,
but I'm not, really.

896
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,989
Oh, no. It's really
squeezing my arm a lot.

897
00:59:08,023 --> 00:59:09,090
That's me.

898
00:59:09,858 --> 00:59:11,159
Okay.

899
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:12,527
Yeah!

900
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,129
He didn't get it.

901
00:59:14,162 --> 00:59:16,998
Oh, my God,
look at how gross it is.

902
00:59:17,032 --> 00:59:20,168
Ew. No! Get out of there,
Terry. Get out! Get out!

903
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:21,669
He's fine, Fern.
Fern, he's fine.

904
00:59:21,703 --> 00:59:23,104
- No, no. No, no.
- He's fine, he's fine.

905
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:24,105
Look. Just look.

906
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:26,875
What is it?
What's he feeding them? Oh!

907
00:59:26,908 --> 00:59:27,943
Probably chicken
or something like that.

908
00:59:27,976 --> 00:59:29,110
No. It's rabbits.

909
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:30,746
Look at that.
Look at that.

910
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,848
- Look at his eyes.
- Yeah, yeah. He wants you.

911
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:34,750
He wants you next.

912
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,084
You get in there.

913
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:37,753
I don't wanna
be the one.

914
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:39,921
He's gonna come right
through the glass.

915
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,414
Pack in,
pack out.

916
01:00:23,264 --> 01:00:25,967
I think they were
actually this big.

917
01:00:40,115 --> 01:00:42,050
First thing
we need to do is ask you

918
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:43,752
to turn off
your bright lights.

919
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:45,086
- I can.
- Oh, it's right there.

920
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,488
Right,
straight up, overhead.

921
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,791
That's the star, Vega.

922
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:51,827
But it's 24
light years away.

923
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,894
- Wow.
- Wow.

924
01:00:52,928 --> 01:00:55,596
So what that means

925
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,699
is the light
that you're looking at

926
01:00:57,733 --> 01:01:01,069
left Vega in 1987.

927
01:01:01,102 --> 01:01:03,071
Wow.

928
01:01:03,104 --> 01:01:04,439
And it just got here?

929
01:01:04,472 --> 01:01:05,874
And it just got here.

930
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:09,610
So the telescope
is set up on Jupiter.

931
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:12,948
Jupiter is the
largest planet in our

932
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:15,150
entire solar system.

933
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:17,986
Stars blow up,
and they shoot plasma

934
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:19,855
and atoms out into space.

935
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:21,790
Sometimes land on Earth.

936
01:01:21,823 --> 01:01:23,624
Nourish the soil.

937
01:01:23,658 --> 01:01:26,094
They become part of you.

938
01:01:26,127 --> 01:01:29,664
So, hold out
your right hand

939
01:01:29,698 --> 01:01:32,033
- and look at a star.
- Wow.

940
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:35,270
Because
there are atoms

941
01:01:35,303 --> 01:01:38,907
from stars that
blew up eons ago

942
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,942
that landed
on this planet,

943
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:43,444
and now they're
in your hand.

944
01:01:52,954 --> 01:01:54,022
- Hi.
- Hi.

945
01:01:54,055 --> 01:01:55,590
Sorry, we're closed.

946
01:01:55,623 --> 01:01:57,893
Uh... I'm looking
for Dave.

947
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:00,796
I'm his son,
James.

948
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,464
He's in the kitchen.
Around the counter there.

949
01:02:03,498 --> 01:02:05,066
- That one?
- Yeah.

950
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:11,907
In Nashville,
we recorded a record...

951
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:20,348
I got it. I got it. I got it.

952
01:02:25,721 --> 01:02:27,355
I've been through here.

953
01:02:27,388 --> 01:02:29,224
- Oh, yeah?
- A couple of times, yeah.

954
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:30,658
Huh.

955
01:02:30,692 --> 01:02:32,293
This place, man.

956
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:35,931
I don't know why anybody
would wanna live here.

957
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,299
Well, I can think
of worse places.

958
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:42,403
You wanna know a good way
to get to know a place?

959
01:02:42,437 --> 01:02:43,438
What?

960
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:45,707
AA meetings.

961
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:47,776
- Really?
- I mean, for me.

962
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:50,946
Back when I was with the band,
and I was travelin' around,

963
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:53,248
I used to go to AA
meetings everywhere.

964
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:54,850
It was a great way
to get to know people

965
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:56,284
and to get to
know a place.

966
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:58,286
How's the burger?

967
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:01,122
- Well, it's not bad.
- Yeah?

968
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:02,423
He's a good cook, your dad.

969
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:04,760
It's not that hard
to make a burger.

970
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:07,128
Cold.

971
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:08,997
- That's his wife, Emily.
- Oh, she's cute.

972
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,399
Hope she's older
than she looks.

973
01:03:11,432 --> 01:03:12,734
She's gonna
have a baby.

974
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:15,436
You're gonna be
a grandpa.

975
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,905
When's she due?

976
01:03:16,938 --> 01:03:18,073
In two weeks,
he said.

977
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:20,108
He's on his way home now.

978
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,511
- Asked me to come with him.
- You should go.

979
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,654
I was...

980
01:03:35,891 --> 01:03:37,392
I was, uh...

981
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:41,262
He didn't like it very much

982
01:03:41,296 --> 01:03:43,398
that I wasn't around
when he was...

983
01:03:43,431 --> 01:03:44,399
when he was young.

984
01:03:44,432 --> 01:03:47,402
I tried to be around
when he was older,

985
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:50,739
but he was into his thing,
and I was into mine

986
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,344
and I guess,
I just forgot how to be a dad.

987
01:03:58,446 --> 01:04:00,615
Anyway, I wasn't
very good at it.

988
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:04,019
Don't think about it
too much, Dave.

989
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:06,487
Just go.
Be a grandfather.

990
01:04:18,934 --> 01:04:20,668
You wanna come with me?

991
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:26,507
Maybe I can visit sometime.

992
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,110
Great.

993
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:32,047
'Night.

994
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,548
'Night.

995
01:06:34,302 --> 01:06:36,537

01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:54,582
Huh.

1000
01:08:09,898 --> 01:08:13,401
You made it, Swankie.

1001
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,401
Thanks, man.

1002
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:51,639
Then I'm gonna get the big G
right here. For Georgia.

1003
01:08:51,672 --> 01:08:53,474
And the big bulldog
right here.

1004
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:55,844
It'll be a full half sleeve
for the Georgia Bulldogs.

1005
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,018
Oh, Jesus!

1006
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:43,591
No overnight parking.
You can't sleep here.

1007
01:09:43,624 --> 01:09:45,861
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

1008
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:19,360
Okay, what we've got
is parts and labor,

1009
01:10:19,394 --> 01:10:21,730
- $2,300 and tax.
- Okay.

1010
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,532
I just looked up
the value on your van.

1011
01:10:24,565 --> 01:10:26,234
With that high a mileage,

1012
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:29,104
you're lookin' about
$5,000 at the most.

1013
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:32,340
I'd probably
recommend, um,

1014
01:10:32,373 --> 01:10:33,809
taking that money
and putting it

1015
01:10:33,842 --> 01:10:35,143
towards a different
vehicle so that you...

1016
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:36,912
No, no. Well, I can't do that.

1017
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:40,415
I can't do that. See, 'cause...
All right. Um...

1018
01:10:40,448 --> 01:10:43,384
I, uh,
spent a lot of time and money

1019
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:45,854
building the inside out,
and, um,

1020
01:10:45,887 --> 01:10:47,222
a lot of people
don't understand

1021
01:10:47,255 --> 01:10:48,589
the value of that.

1022
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:51,626
But it's not somethin',
like, we can...

1023
01:10:55,363 --> 01:10:56,998
I live in there.

1024
01:10:57,899 --> 01:10:59,467
It's my home.

1025
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,570
Why can't you just wire it to
me, Doll?

1026
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:04,205
I can pay you...
I can...

1027
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,174
Dolly, listen,
I can pay you back.

1028
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:08,276
I'm gonna do
Amazon again soon.

1029
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:12,013
I'll be able to pay you back
as soon as I get that check.

1030
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:13,048
It's gonna be...

1031
01:11:17,118 --> 01:11:18,453
Yeah... I'm being stubborn?

1032
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:20,188
Well, I think
you're being a bitch.

1033
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:05,801
Hi.

1034
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:07,168
Hi, Fern.

1035
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:08,536
The doorbell works.

1036
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:10,906
Yeah, well,
I didn't hear it, so...

1037
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:12,941
Hey.

1038
01:12:14,175 --> 01:12:16,444
You want yours
with cheese on it? All right.

1039
01:12:16,477 --> 01:12:19,014
- Got my famous four‐egg cake.
- All right.

1040
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:20,615
Dolly talked me into it.
Where do you want it?

1041
01:12:20,648 --> 01:12:22,150
Okay. Yeah,
put it there, Fern.

1042
01:12:22,183 --> 01:12:24,519
Here? Okay.

1043
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:26,221
- All right.
- Ooh, that looks good.

1044
01:12:26,254 --> 01:12:27,789
- Mmm‐hmm.
- I want that one.

1045
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:28,957
All right,
that's yours.

1046
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,059
- It's got your name on it.
- Double cheese,

1047
01:12:31,092 --> 01:12:32,894
- please.
- You want cheese?

1048
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:35,296
- I want two slices, please.
- Okay.

1049
01:12:37,598 --> 01:12:39,801
Uh, this is
my sister, Fern.

1050
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,169
- Fern?
- Hi, Fern. I'm Jim.

1051
01:12:41,202 --> 01:12:42,437
Hi. Sorry. Lime on my hand.

1052
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:43,571
Nice to meet you.
This is my wife, Pam.

1053
01:12:43,604 --> 01:12:45,707
- Hi, Pam. Sorry, wet hand.
- Hi.

1054
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,776
Jim has been working
with George for a long time.

1055
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:49,644
Yeah, George actually
sold us our first house

1056
01:12:49,677 --> 01:12:50,779
before I got
in real estate.

1057
01:12:50,812 --> 01:12:52,447
Did they tell you
how they met?

1058
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,514
No.

1059
01:12:53,548 --> 01:12:55,616
I introduced them.

1060
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:58,053
I introduced you to George,
but I knew George before.

1061
01:12:58,086 --> 01:13:01,556
So, I took her out and I
said, "Listen, um...

1062
01:13:02,657 --> 01:13:04,793
"George is a really
good friend of mine.

1063
01:13:04,826 --> 01:13:06,895
"I don't want you
to mess this up.

1064
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:09,464
"If you're not serious
about him,

1065
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:11,566
"don't mess with him."

1066
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:13,134
And I didn't
mess it up.

1067
01:13:13,168 --> 01:13:15,136
And you said,
"What are you talkin' about?"

1068
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:17,906
And so, how many years
have you been together?

1069
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,075
30 plus.

1070
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:21,710
- Worked out pretty good.
- Yeah, worked out pretty good.

1071
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:24,345
I was able to take care of it on my
own, actually,

1072
01:13:24,379 --> 01:13:26,314
- after that introduction.
- You're welcome.

1073
01:13:26,347 --> 01:13:27,849
Things are
looking good right now.

1074
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:31,619
The prices are goin' up.
2012 was a winner.

1075
01:13:31,652 --> 01:13:33,321
I mean, I wish I would
have had the money

1076
01:13:33,354 --> 01:13:34,455
in 2008
to buy everything,

1077
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:36,257
so I could
sell it now.

1078
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:39,627
Seems like real estate
always ends up on the upside.

1079
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,496
I don't wanna
disagree with you,

1080
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:43,231
but I have
to say I do.

1081
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:48,136
It's strange that
you encourage people

1082
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:52,007
to invest their whole
life savings, go into debt,

1083
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,342
just to buy a house
they can't afford.

1084
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:56,778
Fern,

1085
01:13:56,812 --> 01:14:00,081
that's a rather limited
look at what we do.

1086
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:01,282
Is it limited, George?

1087
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:04,720
I mean,
we're not all in a position to just

1088
01:14:04,753 --> 01:14:06,154
chuck everything
and hit the road.

1089
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:08,223
Oh, you think that's what
I've done, George?

1090
01:14:08,256 --> 01:14:11,526
I chucked everything to hit
the road? Is that what I did?

1091
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:13,695
All right.
I'm sorry.

1092
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:21,937
You know, I think that, um,
what the nomads are doing

1093
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:25,240
is not that different than
what the pioneers did.

1094
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:27,809
I think Fern's part
of an American tradition.

1095
01:14:28,543 --> 01:14:29,945
I think it's great.

1096
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,185
- Hey.
- Hi.

1097
01:14:41,489 --> 01:14:42,691
Here you go.

1098
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:47,395
Okay. Yeah, thanks.

1099
01:14:47,428 --> 01:14:48,930
You know I'll pay you
back, right?

1100
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:50,031
Mmm‐hmm.

1101
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:52,100
- I will.
- Mmm‐hmm.

1102
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:56,271
Why don't you move in with us?

1103
01:14:56,304 --> 01:14:57,505
I can't live here.

1104
01:14:57,538 --> 01:14:59,007
I can't live in this room.

1105
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,077
I can't sleep in this bed.
Thank you, but I can't...

1106
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:03,411
I know,
we're not as interesting

1107
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:04,479
as the people you meet
out there.

1108
01:15:04,512 --> 01:15:05,914
That's not what
I'm talkin' about.

1109
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:07,382
No, that's what it is.

1110
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:11,853
It's always what's out there
that's more interesting.

1111
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,089
You left home
as soon as you could,

1112
01:15:14,122 --> 01:15:17,726
you married Bo after just
knowing him a few months,

1113
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:20,195
and then you moved to the
middle of nowhere with him.

1114
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:22,931
And then
even after Bo passed away,

1115
01:15:23,631 --> 01:15:26,067
you still stayed
in Empire.

1116
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:29,337
I just didn't get it.
I mean, you could have left...

1117
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:30,371
Yeah.

1118
01:15:33,674 --> 01:15:36,878
See, that's why
I can't come here.

1119
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:41,683
I never said this
to you before,

1120
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:43,752
and maybe I should have...

1121
01:15:43,785 --> 01:15:45,053
You know,
when you were growin' up,

1122
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:47,789
you were eccentric
to other people.

1123
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:50,091
You maybe seemed weird,

1124
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:52,493
but it was just because
you were braver,

1125
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:55,030
and more honest
than everybody else.

1126
01:15:56,597 --> 01:16:00,969
And you could see me when I
was hiding from everybody.

1127
01:16:03,404 --> 01:16:06,307
And sometimes you could
see me before I saw myself.

1128
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:12,180
I needed that in my life.

1129
01:16:13,381 --> 01:16:15,316
And you're my sister.

1130
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:18,987
I would have loved having
you around all these years.

1131
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:24,259
You left a big hole
by leaving.

1132
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,300
That one's on me.

1133
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:38,834
Hey.

1134
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:41,703
Hi. Want a sandwich?
You hungry?

1135
01:17:41,737 --> 01:17:43,972
I think
I've met you before.

1136
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:45,774
Yeah, I'm Fern.

1137
01:17:45,807 --> 01:17:48,243
I was workin' at T‐Rock
in Quartzsite.

1138
01:17:48,276 --> 01:17:49,510
- Fern.
- Mmm‐hmm.

1139
01:17:49,544 --> 01:17:52,080
You let Noodle sell his rocks
there, didn't you?

1140
01:17:52,113 --> 01:17:52,981
Yeah.

1141
01:17:53,014 --> 01:17:54,549
Would you like
a beer?

1142
01:17:55,183 --> 01:17:56,184
Uh...

1143
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:58,720
Yeah, okay.
I'll trade you for a sandwich.

1144
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:00,789
- Well, here you go.
- Thanks.

1145
01:18:00,822 --> 01:18:01,857
It's cold, you know.

1146
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,124
You should sit down
by the fire.

1147
01:18:03,158 --> 01:18:04,459
Got a little trouble
with my knees, though.

1148
01:18:04,492 --> 01:18:05,593
Can you help me?

1149
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:07,595
- Of course.
- Thanks, man.

1150
01:18:07,628 --> 01:18:09,430
Yeah, that'll do it. Yeah.

1151
01:18:09,464 --> 01:18:11,199
- All right.
- Great. Thanks.

1152
01:18:11,232 --> 01:18:13,601
You gave me a light
back in Quartzsite.

1153
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:15,737
Mmm‐hmm.
You still have it?

1154
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:20,075
No, that's long gone.
But I do have this for ya.

1155
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:21,977
Want you to have it.

1156
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:25,814
Thanks.
It's really beautiful.

1157
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:27,816
What is that?
What's that stone?

1158
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:29,550
That there
is dinosaur bone.

1159
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:30,686
Really?

1160
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,887
Uh, I think so.

1161
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,654
But I only know what they tell me.

1162
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:35,656
Where are your
mom and dad?

1163
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:37,058
Back home in Wisconsin.

1164
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,027
You think
they worry about you?

1165
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:44,199
You don't get lonely?

1166
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:46,301
Got a girlfriend anywhere?

1167
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:48,737
Well,

1168
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,806
to be truthful,
well, there is one.

1169
01:18:50,839 --> 01:18:52,173
Mmm‐hmm.

1170
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,542
She lives up
in the North Country.

1171
01:18:54,575 --> 01:18:56,077
Small farm.

1172
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:58,346
She's happy
with her life there.

1173
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:01,282
I...

1174
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,985
write letters to her.

1175
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:06,922
Oh, smart man. Very good.
Letters are good.

1176
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,025
I just can't ever
write about anything

1177
01:19:10,058 --> 01:19:12,928
I reckon
she'd care about.

1178
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,698
You ever try poems?

1179
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:20,235
Can't say I have.

1180
01:19:20,268 --> 01:19:22,470
I don't think I know a one.

1181
01:19:23,304 --> 01:19:24,906
Do you know any?

1182
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,877
How about one that I
used for my wedding vow?

1183
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,579
When I was not
much older than you.

1184
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:33,081
Oh, right on.

1185
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:35,083
Mind if I hear it?

1186
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:37,485
Okay. Let's see
if I can remember it.

1187
01:19:37,518 --> 01:19:38,519
Um...

1188
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:44,392
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

1189
01:19:44,425 --> 01:19:47,262
"Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

1190
01:19:47,295 --> 01:19:50,298
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May.

1191
01:19:50,331 --> 01:19:55,303
"And summer's lease
hath all too short a date.

1192
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:59,074
"Sometime too hot
the eye of heaven shines.

1193
01:19:59,107 --> 01:20:02,577
<i>"And often is
his gold complexion dimmed.</i>

1194
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:06,481
<i>"And every fair from fair
sometimes declines.</i>

1195
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:11,887
<i>"By chance or nature's
changing course undimmed.</i>

1196
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,356
<i>"But thy eternal summer
shall not fade.</i>

1197
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:19,494
<i>"Nor lose possession

1198
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:20,561
<i>"Nor</i>

1199
01:20:21,562 --> 01:20:22,798
<i>"shall...</i>

1200
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:27,335
<i>"Nor shall death brag

1201
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:31,206
"When in eternal lines to time

1203
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:41,616
<i>"So long lives this,

1204
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:43,504
Fern!

1205
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:45,040
- Hey!
- Hi!

1206
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:46,274
Hey.

1207
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:52,714
Hi. You made it.

1208
01:22:52,748 --> 01:22:53,915
Yeah.

1209
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:55,917
Good.

1210
01:22:57,919 --> 01:23:01,189
- Hey. Yeah. It's nice.
- Wow. Wow.

1211
01:23:01,222 --> 01:23:03,524
Well, hey.
Come here.

1212
01:23:03,558 --> 01:23:04,926
Come on in.

1213
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,762
- I'll get that.
- Okay.

1214
01:23:10,231 --> 01:23:12,167
This is Emily,
my daughter‐in‐law.

1215
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,301
- I'm Fern.
- So nice to meet you.

1216
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:15,636
- Hi.
- Welcome.

1217
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,706
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey! There you are!

1218
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:18,907
This is Fern.

1219
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,242
Hey. Hi, I'm Mike.

1220
01:23:21,276 --> 01:23:22,510
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1221
01:23:22,543 --> 01:23:24,079
- Nice to meet you. Thank you.
- Welcome, welcome.

1222
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:25,847
And you know James.

1223
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:26,748
Hi, James.
How are you?

1224
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:28,049
Hi. How are you?
It's nice to see you.

1225
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:29,517
Thanks for having me.

1226
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,919
- Who's that? Is that the guy?
- This is Damien.

1227
01:23:30,952 --> 01:23:32,020
- Hi.
- He's the guy.

1228
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:34,022
- Hi, Damien.
- Say hi.

1229
01:23:34,055 --> 01:23:35,156
How's your drive?

1230
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,992
It was great.
Little hairy on the end.

1231
01:23:37,025 --> 01:23:38,259
That's a scary road.

1232
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:40,295
In your van?
I've heard about your van.

1233
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:41,997
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'd like to see it.

1234
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:45,500
I'll, uh, introduce you at some point.
Thanks. Yeah.

1235
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:46,534
Okay.

1236
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:48,303
Where you comin' from?
That's Peter.

1237
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:49,637
Hey!
Can I get you somethin'?

1238
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:51,106
Uh, yeah. Water would be great.
Thanks.

1239
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:52,440
Great. Sure.

1240
01:23:52,473 --> 01:23:54,409
Oh.

1241
01:23:54,442 --> 01:23:55,977
Been on
the road long?

1242
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:58,814
Um... Yeah.
I worked for a while,

1243
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:01,316
but I've been travelin'
since I last saw you, yeah.

1244
01:24:01,349 --> 01:24:02,450
- All right, cool.
- Here you go.

1245
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:04,119
Uh‐oh, uh‐oh.

1246
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:06,487
Okay, I'll give you
to mommy.

1247
01:24:23,204 --> 01:24:24,973
- You had a flat.
- Did you eat something?

1248
01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:26,708
Eat something?
Huh?

1249
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:28,910
You had a flat tire
on your van, Dave.

1250
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:31,579
Oh, okay.
I hadn't noticed.

1251
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,415
'Cause you're stayin'?

1252
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:36,752
Yeah.

1253
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:37,853
Good.

1254
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:39,988
Yeah,
I never expected to.

1255
01:24:40,021 --> 01:24:41,422
Never thought I'd spend
another night

1256
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:43,558
under a roof, but...

1257
01:24:44,592 --> 01:24:46,461
Well, this is
a really nice place, Dave.

1258
01:24:46,494 --> 01:24:48,663
Yeah, you can stay.

1259
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:51,099
Oh, good, thanks.
I need to do laundry.

1260
01:24:55,336 --> 01:24:58,139
You know, I meant
stay longer, Fern.

1261
01:24:58,173 --> 01:25:00,508
They do have
a guest house.

1262
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:05,346
I'm serious.

1263
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,982
What'd they think
about that?

1264
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:09,450
I already asked them.

1265
01:25:11,652 --> 01:25:14,790
I like you.
You're a good person.

1266
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:17,458
You...

1267
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:20,328
You get along with people
for the most part.

1268
01:25:20,361 --> 01:25:22,063
You know...

1269
01:25:23,464 --> 01:25:26,567
I like being around you.

1270
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:28,636
I like being around you.

1271
01:25:28,669 --> 01:25:31,272
What's up? What's up?
You don't wanna be that way?

1272
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:33,742
You wanna be like this,
don't you? Yeah.

1273
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,144
Yeah.

1274
01:25:36,177 --> 01:25:38,446
<i>♪♪ Sometimes you get</i>
<i>a notion</i>

1275
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:41,282
<i>♪♪ To jump into

1276
01:25:42,718 --> 01:25:44,786
Here. He might be
getting a little tired.

1277
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:47,055
Here. I've gotta go
to the kitchen.

1278
01:25:47,088 --> 01:25:48,690
Okay. Okay.

1279
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:51,626
Just, just...

1280
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,834
Don't be gone long, Dave.

1281
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:00,902
Okay?

1282
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:24,659
Oh!

1283
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:29,330
...aren't you?

1284
01:26:29,364 --> 01:26:31,399
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1285
01:26:31,432 --> 01:26:33,434
Come here.
Come here.

1286
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,806
Here they come.

1287
01:26:37,839 --> 01:26:39,540
Look at all those.

1288
01:26:39,574 --> 01:26:41,576
How many do you have?

1289
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:44,079
I don't know
how many we have.

1290
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:50,886
That one's beautiful.
Look at those feathers.

1291
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:52,620
Hey. Where's that
little puffed one?

1292
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:53,922
I don't want him
sneakin' up on me.

1293
01:26:53,955 --> 01:26:54,990
Yeah.

1294
01:27:00,028 --> 01:27:00,896
Thank you.

1295
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:03,164
Can you give me
some more stuffing...

1296
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:04,833
- Corn?
- ...and a little corn?

1297
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:07,869
What is
that called?

1298
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:09,938
Thanks, Fern.
That's good.

1299
01:27:09,971 --> 01:27:11,372
Gravy?

1300
01:27:11,406 --> 01:27:14,542
This turkey
is so moist.

1301
01:27:14,575 --> 01:27:16,344
This is
incredible food.

1302
01:27:16,377 --> 01:27:18,579
Thank you, Em.
Thank you, James,

1303
01:27:18,613 --> 01:27:20,716
and just wanna say
a little somethin'.

1304
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:23,284
Uh... To welcome... To Fern.

1305
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:25,453
- Yeah.
- To this...

1306
01:27:25,486 --> 01:27:26,955
- To this feast of a...
- Thanks!

1307
01:27:26,988 --> 01:27:29,157
...a feast of a family,

1308
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:30,625
and to the new one,

1309
01:27:30,658 --> 01:27:33,494
and I guess
the old ones, too,

1310
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:34,730
and everybody in between.

1311
01:27:34,763 --> 01:27:35,997
- Yeah.
- So, welcome, Fern.

1312
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:37,665
- Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

1313
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:39,467
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

1314
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,002
Yay!

1315
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:42,103
Cheers, all.

1316
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:45,273
Ah, the bells
of Acrosanti.

1317
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,410
That's the problem.
That's the problem.

1318
01:27:49,444 --> 01:27:51,046
And they're not...
No, they're terrible.

1319
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:52,213
Yeah.

1320
01:28:00,488 --> 01:28:02,557
I like that name, Empire.

1321
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:05,493
You know, we had
an airport, public pool,

1322
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,228
a golf course.

1323
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:09,664
Wow. Sounds nice.

1324
01:28:09,698 --> 01:28:12,400
What was your house
like there?

1325
01:28:12,433 --> 01:28:15,804
Nothing special.
Just a company tract house.

1326
01:28:17,538 --> 01:28:18,974
Actually,
it was special.

1327
01:28:21,609 --> 01:28:23,411
We were right
on the edge of town.

1328
01:28:23,444 --> 01:28:27,515
And our backyard looks out
at this huge open space.

1329
01:28:27,548 --> 01:28:30,185
It was just desert,
desert, desert,

1330
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:31,920
all the way to the mountains.

1331
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:34,990
There was nothin' in our way.

1332
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:39,294
You know,
I'm really glad you're here.

1333
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:41,129
Dave really likes you.

1334
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:42,798
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1335
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:45,133
- He talks about you a lot.
- Hmm.

1336
01:33:46,601 --> 01:33:48,436
Happy New Year.

1337
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:53,975
Happy New Year!

1338
01:34:25,673 --> 01:34:28,043
Because she loved rocks.

1339
01:34:39,487 --> 01:34:41,857
See you down the road,
Swankie.

1340
01:35:17,058 --> 01:35:20,328
Bo never knew his parents
and we never had kids.

1341
01:35:21,496 --> 01:35:23,498
If I didn't stay,

1342
01:35:23,531 --> 01:35:28,069
if I left, it would be like
he never existed.

1343
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:32,708
I couldn't pack up
and move on.

1344
01:35:32,741 --> 01:35:35,010
He loved Empire.

1345
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:37,913
He loved his work so much.

1346
01:35:37,946 --> 01:35:40,682
He loved being there.
Everybody loved him.

1347
01:35:43,484 --> 01:35:45,353
So I stayed.

1348
01:35:45,887 --> 01:35:48,356
Same town, same house.

1349
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:56,131
It's like my dad used to say,

1350
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:58,666
"What's remembered lives."

1351
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:04,873
I maybe spent
too much of my life

1352
01:36:04,906 --> 01:36:07,976
just remembering, Bob.

1353
01:36:09,044 --> 01:36:10,345
You know what I mean?

1354
01:36:10,378 --> 01:36:11,379
I can...

1355
01:36:12,047 --> 01:36:14,750
I can relate.
Um...

1356
01:36:14,783 --> 01:36:18,687
I rarely ever talk
about my son.

1357
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,522
But, uh, today would be...

1358
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:29,097
Today would be
his 33rd birthday,

1359
01:36:30,198 --> 01:36:33,001
and five years ago,
he took his life.

1360
01:36:37,205 --> 01:36:41,009
And I can still barely
say that in a sentence.

1361
01:36:44,179 --> 01:36:46,581
And for a long time,

1362
01:36:48,483 --> 01:36:51,386
every day was, uh...

1363
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:54,355
The question was...

1364
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,325
how can I be alive
on this Earth,

1365
01:36:57,358 --> 01:36:58,994
when he's not?

1366
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:02,731
And I didn't have an answer.

1367
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,467
And those were some hard,
hard days.

1368
01:37:08,737 --> 01:37:10,071
But...

1369
01:37:11,873 --> 01:37:13,674
I realized that

1370
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:17,478
I could honor him by, uh,

1371
01:37:18,379 --> 01:37:22,217
helping people,
and serving people.

1372
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:25,220
It gives me a reason to go
through the day.

1373
01:37:25,253 --> 01:37:27,455
Some days that's all I've got.

1374
01:37:30,658 --> 01:37:33,228
And out here,
there's a lot of people our age.

1375
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:35,630
Inevitably,
there's grief and loss.

1376
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:38,700
And a lot of 'em don't
get over it either.

1377
01:37:38,734 --> 01:37:40,168
And that's okay.

1378
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,338
That's okay.

1379
01:37:44,539 --> 01:37:47,642
One of the things I love
most about this life

1380
01:37:48,543 --> 01:37:52,047
is that
there's no final goodbye.

1381
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:55,016
You know, I've met
hundreds of people out here

1382
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:57,585
and I don't ever say
a final goodbye.

1383
01:37:57,618 --> 01:38:00,756
I always just say,
"I'll see you down the road."

1384
01:38:00,789 --> 01:38:02,390
And I do.

1385
01:38:02,423 --> 01:38:05,493
And whether it's a month,
or a year,

1386
01:38:05,526 --> 01:38:06,627
or sometimes years,

1387
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:08,063
I see them again.

1388
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:09,397
And I can look
down the road

1389
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,366
and I can be certain
in my heart

1390
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:14,669
that I'll see
my son again.

1391
01:38:17,005 --> 01:38:19,640
You'll see Bo again.

1392
