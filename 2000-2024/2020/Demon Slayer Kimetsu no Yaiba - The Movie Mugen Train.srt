00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,661
Kenichi...

3
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,455
Hideki...

4
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,373
Minoru...

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,584
Masao...

6
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:53,461
Susumu...

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,755
Yuta...

8
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,882
Yaichi...

00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,009
Toyoaki...

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,886
Isao...

00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,055
Ryosuke...

12
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:05,807
Yukio...

13
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:07,517
Takahiro...

14
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,448
Master, we should go.

15
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,034
It's not good for your health.

16
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:32,333
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

17
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,343
I'd like to settle the score
for these children

18
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:45,721
who died while I'm in charge.

19
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:55,773
I've already received seven cases
caused by demons this month.

20
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,446
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

21
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:08,286
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

22
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,750
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

23
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:22,258
the one thing they can never crush
is a human's will.

24
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,761
No matter how battered we are,

25
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:30,850
we will always rise up again to fight.

26
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:23,444
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

27
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,115
Are the police still around?

28
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,951
We'll have to go even if they are.

29
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:34,872
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

30
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,124
Hey, idiot!

31
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:37,750
We should go, too!

32
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:40,962
Hey, don't leave me behind!

33
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,008
W-Wait up!

34
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,470
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

35
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:50,805
Zenitsu!

36
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:07,905
So fast!

37
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,032
Sorry! We're very sorry!

38
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,660
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

39
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:13,911
So freakin' fast!

40
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,837
Ma'am, is that all right?

41
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,672
Thank you.

42
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:26,132
Sorry to trouble you.

43
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:26,924
Oh no.

44
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,510
It's the least I can do.

45
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,272
He's a Hashira, right?

46
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:42,899
This Rengoku person...

47
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,152
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

48
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,278
Sure.

49
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:51,282
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

50
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,575
Hey!

51
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,994
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

52
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:57,747
Delicious!

53
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:31,405
Delicious!

54
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,074
Delicious!

55
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,076
Delicious!

56
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,080
Delicious!

57
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:41,666
Delicious!

58
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,169
Delicious!

59
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:47,755
Delicious!

60
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,174
Delicious!

61
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,426
Delicious!

62
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:55,680
Delicious!

63
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:58,933
Delicious!

64
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,185
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

65
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,478
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,272
Not just some random glutton?

67
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:05,940
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

68
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:07,358
Delicious!

69
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,694
Um, excuse me...

70
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:11,487
Delicious!

71
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,156
R-Rengoku?

72
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,991
Delicious!

73
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,245
Uh, we really get that part already.

74
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:29,005
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

75
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:30,089
Yes.

76
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,883
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

77
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,763
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

78
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:41,809
I see. And inside that box there...

79
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:43,019
Yes.

80
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,104
It's my sister Nezuko.

81
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:48,733
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

82
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:53,196
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

83
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,451
Have a seat here.

84
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,169
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

85
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,881
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

86
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:14,550
What are you three doing here?

87
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,385
A mission?

88
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,805
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

89
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:25,394
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

90
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,981
Yes! I see now! Understood!

91
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,149
Right.

92
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,194
Also, there's one more thing.

93
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,364
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

94
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,325
What is it? Let's hear it.

95
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,036
About my father...

96
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,080
What about your father?

97
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,749
Well, he was really frail.

98
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,126
Was he really?

99
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:51,546
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

100
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,256
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

101
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:54,590
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

102
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,969
The thing is...

103
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,011
What's up?

104
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:01,139
Hinokami Kagura...

105
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,682
Dance!

106
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:07,562
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

107
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:11,482
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

108
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,860
I was hoping you'd tell me.

109
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:20,324
Right!

110
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,743
But I know nothing!

111
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:26,956
I've never even heard
the term "Hinokami Dance" before.

112
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:32,587
But it's truly commendable that your father
was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

113
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,964
All right, end of discussion!

114
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,049
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

115
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,845
You should become my Tsuguko,
my apprentice! I'll look after you!

116
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,557
Hold on a second!
And just what are you looking at?

117
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,477
<i>He's totally weird, all right.</i>

118
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:50,104
Flame Breathing has a long history.

119
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:55,735
In any given era, there's always been a Flame
and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

120
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:57,195
Flame.

121
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:58,488
Water.

122
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,780
Wind.

123
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,073
Stone.

124
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,035
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

125
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,456
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

126
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,084
Mist is a fork of Wind.

127
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,961
Young Mizoguchi!

128
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,088
What color is your sword?

129
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,218
My name's Kamado.
And the color is black.

130
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,719
A black sword, huh?

131
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,763
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

132
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,766
For real?

133
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:30,394
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

134
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:34,774
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

135
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,736
Come to me, and I'll train you!

136
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,530
You can rest easy now!

137
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,989
No, thank you!

138
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,492
And just what are you looking at?

139
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,378
<i>He's strange,
but he seems to be very caring.</i>

140
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:58,840
<i>And from his scent,
I can pick up his strong sense of justice.</i>

141
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:05,304
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

142
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,974
That's dangerous, you idiot!

143
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:11,894
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

144
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,814
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

145
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,568
You never know when a demon might appear.

146
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:25,074
You're kidding, right?
Demons show up on this train?

147
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,784
Sure do!

148
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,952
What? They do?

149
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:32,623
Nooo! So, we're not heading
to where the demons are, but we're here?

150
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,375
Nooo!

151
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,169
I'm getting off!

152
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:41,716
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

153
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:46,262
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

154
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,182
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

155
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:59,275
Right, I see!
I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

156
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:08,367
May I...

157
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:09,952
see your...

158
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,829
tickets, please?

159
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,540
What's he doing?

160
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:18,669
The conductor's going to check
your ticket and punch a hole in it.

161
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,057
Here.

162
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,541
<i>What is this?</i>

163
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,960
<i>There's a horrible scent.</i>

164
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,213
Thank you...

165
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,382
very much.

166
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:09,971
Mr. Conductor...

167
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,098
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

168
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,602
As this is an emergency,
please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

169
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:40,460
Was it a Blood Demon Art
that hid that massive body?

170
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:42,920
I had a hard time detecting you.

171
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:48,384
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

172
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:55,349
my bright red Flame Blade
will burn you to the bone!

173
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,565
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

174
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,567
<i>First Form...</i>

175
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:15,828
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

176
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:27,215
Amazing.

177
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:29,717
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

178
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,722
There's still one more.

179
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,390
Come with me!

180
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,685
All right!

181
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,648
D-Don't leave me behind!

182
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,128
You will not lay a finger on that man!

183
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,051
Didn't you hear me?

184
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,971
I said I'm your opponent.

185
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:19,433
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

186
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,560
All right!

187
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,854
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

188
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,897
We gotta save the passenger first!

189
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:27,483
It won't matter
once I destroy that thing!

190
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,959
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

191
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:48,379
We're good to go now.

192
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,381
Let's finish him off in short order.

193
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,475
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

194
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:02,477
<i>Second Form...</i>

195
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:08,149
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

196
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:29,670
Tha...

197
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,672
Tha...

198
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:35,593
That was awesome, Bro!
Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

199
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,387
Please make me your apprentice!

200
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,182
Fine by me! I'll make
a fine swordsman out of you!

201
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:43,226
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

202
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,728
I'll train all of you!

203
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,689
Big Bro Rengoku!

204
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,149
Bro!

205
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:52,235
- Bro!
- Bro!

206
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,112
Big Bro Rengoku!

207
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,490
I did as I was told! I punched
their tickets and put them to sleep!

208
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:43,411
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

209
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:47,874
Please let me be reunited
with my dead wife and daughter!

210
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,543
I'm begging you.

211
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,837
I'm begging you.

212
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,756
Sure thing.

213
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,013
You did a good job.

214
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,058
Go to sleep.

215
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:13,441
Have a nice dream
where you can meet your family.

216
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:15,735
Excuse me.

217
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:20,907
What do you want us to do?

218
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,912
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

219
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,581
Wait here until then.

220
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:35,713
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up
sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

221
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:41,177
When you tie the ropes,
be careful not to touch their bodies.

222
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,681
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

223
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:49,602
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

224
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:53,105
so that you can have blissful dreams.

225
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,274
Okay.

226
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:54,333
<i>What's going on? What happened?</i>

227
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:01,966
<i>Calm down.</i>

228
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:03,843
<i>Calm down.</i>

229
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,304
<i>You have to calm down.</i>

230
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,690
Hey!

231
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,692
It's Big Bro!

232
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,861
Welcome home, Big Bro!

233
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,779
Did you sell the charcoal?

234
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,466
Big Bro?

235
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:59,565
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

236
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,036
To be able to die while dreaming...

237
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,580
Just how lucky are you?

238
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:18,960
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

239
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:25,258
A human's driving force
is the heart, the spirit!

240
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:31,764
All you have to do
is destroy the spiritual core.

241
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,142
You can kill them just like that!

242
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:37,436
All human hearts are the same.

243
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:43,651
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

244
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,865
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

245
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:53,202
That's right. Don't forget
what he warned us about.

246
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,547
Take a deep, slow breath...

247
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,467
while you count.

248
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,472
<i>Do that, and you'll fall asleep.</i>

249
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,265
<i>One...</i>

250
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,641
<i>Two...</i>

251
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:17,310
<i>Three...</i>

252
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,228
<i>Four...</i>

253
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,063
<i>Five...</i>

254
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,065
<i>Six...</i>

255
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:32,533
And then, we were surprised
because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

256
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,410
What a weirdo!

257
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:39,499
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

258
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,877
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

259
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,466
You don't have a fever, do you?

260
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,470
Take it easy and get some rest today, okay?

261
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:54,430
I'm all right.

262
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:55,973
Are you sure?

263
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:58,518
Hey! You come back here!

264
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:01,145
Gotcha!

265
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,356
What do you think you're doing?

266
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:07,360
Hey! You stop that right now!

267
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,362
Seems like...

268
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:14,158
I was having a bad dream or something.

269
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:20,123
Falling deeper into sleep,
deep in their dreams...

270
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:23,501
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

271
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,255
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

272
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:30,591
Even in the stomach,
deep in their dreams...

273
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,678
Looks like fun.

274
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:37,265
You're starting to have
a happy dream, aren't you?

275
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,019
You are falling...

276
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,522
You are falling...

277
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:46,774
into a dream.

278
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,283
It's a deep slumber.

279
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:57,785
They can...

280
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,872
no longer awaken.

281
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,133
This way!

282
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,260
The peaches over here taste great!

283
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,637
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

284
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,764
I'll make you a chaplet!

285
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,184
I can make these really great-looking ones...

286
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:22,852
Nezuko!

287
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:25,521
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

288
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:27,899
Zenitsu?

289
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:38,201
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

290
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:39,452
River?

291
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,706
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

292
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,459
I can't swim.

293
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:51,464
I-I'll just carry you on my back
and jump right over the river!

294
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,467
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

295
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,972
Just leave it to me!

296
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,475
Let's go!

297
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:19,534
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

298
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:21,410
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

299
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:23,329
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

300
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:25,164
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

301
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,666
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

302
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:27,500
Boss!

303
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:28,751
Boss!

304
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:32,505
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

305
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:37,176
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

306
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:40,680
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

307
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,186
Here he is!

308
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,772
All right, let's go! Showdown!

309
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:51,649
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

310
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:55,236
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

311
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:59,490
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

312
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,576
Let's go!

313
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:03,911
- Hey!
- Hey!

314
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,691
<i>Why did I come here?</i>

315
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:38,905
<i>Oh, right.</i>

316
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,407
<i>To report to my father...</i>

317
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,826
<i>that I've become a Hashira.</i>

318
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:06,015
So what if you've become a Hashira?

319
00:26:10,812 --> 00:26:11,813
Worthless.

320
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,481
It means nothing.

321
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:17,485
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

322
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,779
Neither you...

323
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:21,989
nor I.

324
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,413
Brother...

325
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:34,460
Was our father pleased to hear your news?

326
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:40,716
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

327
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:45,763
<i>He wasn't always like that.</i>

328
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:50,351
<i>After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps.</i>

329
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:53,229
<i>He was a passionate man.</i>

330
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:57,567
<i>And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.</i>

331
00:26:58,609 --> 00:26:59,944
<i>Suddenly.</i>

332
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:05,408
<i>The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...</i>

333
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,455
<i>Why?</i>

334
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,419
<i>It's pointless to think
about such things, so stop.</i>

335
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:20,673
<i>Senjuro is even worse off.</i>

336
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:26,471
<i>He barely has any memories of our mother
who died of illness when he was very young,</i>

337
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,931
<i>and just look at the state our father is in.</i>

338
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,521
I'm going to be honest.

339
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:38,983
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

340
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,652
He told me that it meant nothing.

341
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:45,907
But that's not enough
to extinguish my passion!

342
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:49,160
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

343
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:52,163
I'll never give in!

344
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,165
And Senjuro...

345
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,920
You're not like me.

346
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,380
You have a big brother...

347
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:04,425
who believes in his little brother.

348
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:09,263
No matter what path you take,
you're going to become a fine human being!

349
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,682
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

350
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:12,892
Let's do our best!

351
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,102
Let's do our best and live on!

352
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,396
No matter how lonely it gets.

353
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:26,113
Looking good.

354
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,533
Those ropes that I created are used...

355
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:32,995
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

356
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:38,334
I always fight with the utmost caution.

357
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:43,673
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

358
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:50,054
I'll enjoy the feast
after killing the Demon Slayers.

359
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,606
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

360
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,859
Relax your shoulders.

361
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,403
Like this?

362
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:06,696
That's right.

363
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,616
Close call. He's right there.

364
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,661
<i>I have to make sure he doesn't see me!</i>

365
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,248
<i>I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!</i>

366
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:19,167
<i>Hurry!</i>

367
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:24,380
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

368
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,051
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

369
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:36,934
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside
the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

370
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:40,396
That's what you must destroy.

371
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:46,152
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

372
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:54,660
There it is!

373
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:59,165
The scenery doesn't end here,
but you can't go any further.

374
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:05,505
<i>I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!</i>

375
00:30:08,382 --> 00:30:12,303
<i>And then, I'll get to see
a happy dream myself!</i>

376
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,398
<i>What an odd realm of the subconscious.</i>

377
00:30:24,982 --> 00:30:26,108
<i>It's hot.</i>

378
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,652
<i>It's burning up.</i>

379
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,946
<i>I have to hurry.</i>

380
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:47,505
Found it!

381
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,549
The spiritual core!

382
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,803
I've never seen a red one before.

383
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,059
All I have to do is destroy this and...

384
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:01,853
It'll be my turn to...

385
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:30,798
<i>I thought humans couldn't move
while they were under a spell.</i>

386
00:31:34,677 --> 00:31:37,638
<i>What a strong survival instinct he has!</i>

387
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,066
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

388
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,735
Wow!

389
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:54,071
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

390
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,532
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

391
00:31:56,908 --> 00:32:01,329
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

392
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:03,790
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

393
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,751
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

394
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:08,711
Can you get the grill ready for me?

395
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:10,296
Okay!

396
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:12,590
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

397
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:15,301
Okay, I'll be in charge
of flipping them over, then!

398
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:16,761
Me, too!

399
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,388
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

400
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,098
No fair!

401
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:36,531
There.

402
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,742
Nezuko, let's go.

403
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,086
What did I just say?

404
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,257
I'm back!

405
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,885
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

406
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,054
Yeah, I'm home!

407
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,683
Welcome home, Big Bro!

408
00:33:06,894 --> 00:33:08,813
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

409
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:11,816
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

410
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:14,235
In broad daylight?

411
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,156
She's not supposed to?

412
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:20,575
Well...

413
00:33:20,908 --> 00:33:22,034
Um...

414
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,244
Tanjiro...

415
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:25,329
Could you get the bath ready?

416
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:28,166
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

417
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:33,713
<i>I keep saying all these strange things.</i>

418
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:36,591
Am I tired maybe?

419
00:33:43,306 --> 00:33:45,600
Huh? It's gone.

420
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:50,188
I wonder what that was
for just a split second.

421
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:52,023
A toolbox perhaps?

422
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,154
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

423
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:01,866
Wake up!

424
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:06,370
Wake up!

425
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,459
Wake up!

426
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,294
You're under attack!

427
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,544
It's a dream!

428
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:16,004
This is a dream!

429
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:17,214
Wake up now!

430
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:20,551
<i>I see... That's right, I'm...</i>

431
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:23,721
<i>on board the train!</i>

432
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:25,556
Wake up and fight!

433
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:27,058
Fight!

434
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,937
Fight!

435
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:37,443
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

436
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:40,071
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

437
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:43,616
Why are you always
taking food away from Big Bro?

438
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:45,033
What's your problem?

439
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:46,910
You just had seconds!

440
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:53,167
<i>No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!</i>

441
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,461
<i>How can I get out of it?</i>

442
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:57,672
<i>Now that I've realized that it's a dream...</i>

443
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:00,675
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

444
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,236
I have to wake up...

445
00:35:58,232 --> 00:35:59,400
Big Bro!

446
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:01,569
- What should we do? The fire is—
- Big Bro!

447
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:06,157
<i>That's Nezuko's scent!</i>

448
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:08,910
<i>It's Nezuko's blood!</i>

449
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,412
<i>Nezuko...</i>

450
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:12,663
<i>Nezuko!</i>

451
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:18,544
<i>My uniform...</i>

452
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:20,004
<i>My Nichirin Sword...</i>

453
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:22,215
<i>I'm waking up!</i>

454
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,841
<i>Little by little.</i>

455
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,510
<i>Little by little!</i>

456
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,345
Big Bro?

457
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,514
Big Bro, are you all right?

458
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:30,765
Big Bro?

459
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:32,809
Sorry.

460
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:34,519
I have to go.

461
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,400
<i>I have to hurry back!</i>

462
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,362
I'm sorry.

463
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:45,738
Big Bro!

464
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,532
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

465
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:56,749
<i>If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...</i>

466
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,710
<i>I have to find him
and slash him right away!</i>

467
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:03,756
<i>Where is he? I have to...</i>

468
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:08,302
Where are you going, Big Bro?

469
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:19,188
I picked lots of vegetables today!

470
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:25,361
Mom! This way!

471
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:28,364
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

472
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:32,702
Mom?

473
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:35,455
Tanjiro, are you all right?

474
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:37,832
Big Bro...

475
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:48,384
What's the matter, Tanjiro?
Why are you dressed like that?

476
00:37:59,604 --> 00:38:01,439
I wish I could stay here...

477
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:03,232
forever.

478
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,613
<i>I wish I could turn around and go back.</i>

479
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:14,118
<i>By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.</i>

480
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,037
<i>Right here.</i>

481
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:19,290
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

482
00:38:20,124 --> 00:38:22,418
<i>they'd all have been alive and well now.</i>

483
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:28,800
<i>And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.</i>

484
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:33,221
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

485
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:35,056
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

486
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,560
<i>I should be here
making charcoal every day.</i>

487
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:43,064
<i>I never would've laid a hand on a sword!</i>

488
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,985
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

489
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,405
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

490
00:39:04,836 --> 00:39:07,713
<i>But I've lost them now.</i>

491
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:09,924
<i>I can never go back!</i>

492
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:14,846
Big Bro!

493
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:17,849
Don't leave us behind!

494
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:25,273
<i>Sorry!</i>

495
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:27,900
<i>I'm sorry, Rokuta!</i>

496
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,530
<i>We can't be together anymore.</i>

497
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:37,994
<i>But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?</i>

498
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,581
<i>I'll be thinking of you all!</i>

499
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,462
<i>There are lots of things to thank you for.</i>

500
00:39:47,962 --> 00:39:50,923
<i>Lots of things to be sorry for!</i>

501
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,301
<i>But I will never forget you!</i>

502
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:57,054
<i>No matter what,
my heart will always be with you!</i>

503
00:39:58,014 --> 00:39:59,056
<i>So, please...</i>

504
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,559
<i>forgive me!</i>

505
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:13,237
I have to destroy
his spiritual core right away.

506
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:34,967
<i>So, this is the inside of his heart?</i>

507
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:39,472
<i>How can it be so beautiful?</i>

508
00:40:40,014 --> 00:40:41,974
<i>It's so endlessly vast...</i>

509
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:43,768
<i>and...</i>

510
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:46,771
<i>also warm.</i>

511
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:59,992
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

512
00:41:02,078 --> 00:41:06,040
What's with this realm
of the subconscious?

513
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:11,295
And that creepy naked boar...

514
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,881
Seriously, this is insane.

515
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,598
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

516
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,309
You stupid naked boar!

517
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,072
It's pitch-dark.

518
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:43,786
It's pitch-dark,
and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

519
00:41:43,828 --> 00:41:47,582
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

520
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,753
Do I have to grope around
to find his spiritual core?

521
00:41:53,087 --> 00:41:54,839
You must be kidding me.

522
00:41:57,508 --> 00:41:58,551
What was that?

523
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:12,773
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

524
00:42:13,107 --> 00:42:16,527
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko.

525
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,490
I'm so going to kill you.

526
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:23,951
Where's Nezuko?

527
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:25,745
Wh-Who the heck knows?

528
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:28,790
All right, then... Die!

529
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,463
Nooo!

530
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:41,803
They're having trouble, aren't they?

531
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:43,679
I wonder why.

532
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:47,809
They haven't destroyed
any of the spiritual cores yet.

533
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:50,061
Oh well...

534
00:42:50,645 --> 00:42:54,565
I guess it doesn't matter,
since they're buying me some time.

535
00:42:58,694 --> 00:42:59,570
<i>Not here.</i>

536
00:42:59,904 --> 00:43:02,281
<i>But I can smell a demon, even faintly.</i>

537
00:43:02,907 --> 00:43:04,158
<i>What's this, though?</i>

538
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:06,577
<i>It's like there's a film over everything!</i>

539
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:10,331
<i>There's a faint demon scent everywhere!</i>

540
00:43:10,915 --> 00:43:12,583
<i>I can't tell the exact location!</i>

541
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:14,627
I have to hurry!

542
00:43:15,169 --> 00:43:17,088
Nezuko's bleeding!

543
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:21,342
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

544
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:23,261
<i>What should I do?</i>

545
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:28,224
<i>Am I unable to use
Total Concentration Breathing now?</i>

546
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,727
<i>Am I just asleep right now?</i>

547
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:35,106
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

548
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:41,320
Take up your sword.

549
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:45,992
There's something you must cut.

550
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,296
<i>There's something...</i>

551
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:00,673
<i>I must cut.</i>

552
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,260
<i>There's something I must cut...</i>

553
00:44:04,677 --> 00:44:06,304
<i>in order to wake up.</i>

554
00:44:07,972 --> 00:44:09,390
<i>I think I know what it is.</i>

555
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:13,186
<i>But what if I'm wrong?</i>

556
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:17,440
<i>If what happens in this dream
has an effect on reality, too...</i>

557
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:19,442
<i>there'll be no going back.</i>

558
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:24,447
<i>Don't hesitate! Do it!</i>

559
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:26,073
<i>You have to do it!</i>

560
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:29,035
<i>My death in this dream
will lead me to reality!</i>

561
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:30,661
<i>In other words...</i>

562
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:33,331
<i>what I have to cut is...</i>

563
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:38,795
<i>my own neck!</i>

564
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:58,940
I'm all right. I'm alive.

565
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,488
Nezuko! Are you okay?

566
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:10,034
Nezuko...

567
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:13,121
Zenitsu...

568
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:14,914
Inosuke...

569
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:16,833
Rengoku...

570
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:23,005
<i>Who are these people?</i>

571
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:26,509
<i>They're all connected
by the wrists with ropes.</i>

572
00:45:27,593 --> 00:45:29,178
<i>Rope...</i>

573
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:32,849
<i>What's this?</i>

574
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:34,559
<i>It's burned off.</i>

575
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:37,019
<i>Nezuko's burning blood did it?</i>

576
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:40,022
<i>It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!</i>

577
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:44,193
This smell... The ticket!

578
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:49,240
<i>I knew it. It's giving off
a faint demon smell, too.</i>

579
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:52,326
<i>We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.</i>

580
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:55,246
<i>This must be a demon's work!</i>

581
00:45:55,746 --> 00:46:00,793
<i>Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?</i>

582
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:04,755
<i>I don't know why...</i>

583
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:09,677
<i>but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.</i>

584
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:13,473
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

585
00:46:14,056 --> 00:46:15,850
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

586
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:25,818
Zenitsu! Wake up!

587
00:46:26,068 --> 00:46:29,071
Wake up, Zenitsu!
You have to wake up!

588
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:33,951
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

589
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:36,204
Inosuke...

590
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,459
There, there... Sorry, okay?

591
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:43,085
Thanks.

592
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:44,962
You did a great job, Nezuko.

593
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:50,968
<i>It's no good. These two don't wake up.</i>

594
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:53,221
<i>What can I do?</i>

595
00:46:56,224 --> 00:46:57,016
Rengoku—

596
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,646
What are you doing?

597
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:07,652
<i>Is a demon controlling her?</i>

598
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:09,445
Get out of our way!

599
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:13,533
Thanks to you guys,
we won't be able to have dreams!

600
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:17,703
<i>Is she acting of her own free will?</i>

601
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:21,082
<i>This man, too?</i>

602
00:47:24,585 --> 00:47:26,129
What do you think you're doing?

603
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:29,006
If you're awake,
you'd better help us out!

604
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:33,010
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

605
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:37,265
I'm going to tell him, and then,
he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

606
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:42,895
<i>Is he the one
who was connected to me?</i>

607
00:47:43,437 --> 00:47:44,730
<i>Tuberculosis...</i>

608
00:47:45,106 --> 00:47:46,399
<i>He's sick.</i>

609
00:47:46,941 --> 00:47:48,401
<i>Poor man.</i>

610
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:51,404
<i>What this demon did is unforgivable.</i>

611
00:47:51,904 --> 00:47:54,490
<i>He took advantage of their weak souls!</i>

612
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:57,577
Sorry.

613
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:01,080
I have to go fight.

614
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:19,599
You want to stay
inside a happy dream, don't you?

615
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,018
I know.

616
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:26,272
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

617
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:34,322
If only this was the dream...

618
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,626
<i>I was willing...</i>

619
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:53,883
<i>to hurt others if it meant
I could escape from the pain of this illness.</i>

620
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:57,887
<i>But it was warm...</i>

621
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:01,641
<i>inside your dream and inside your soul.</i>

622
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:06,646
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

623
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:13,402
The air is so clear, and it feels good.

624
00:49:20,952 --> 00:49:24,413
Is that his spiritual core?

625
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:26,415
Why are you showing it to me?

626
00:49:30,545 --> 00:49:34,549
Did you bring me here
because I was searching for it?

627
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:41,889
No way!

628
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:45,226
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

629
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:47,520
Why would you...

630
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:55,570
<i>The shining little sprites
inside you lit up my heart.</i>

631
00:49:58,072 --> 00:49:59,657
Are you all right?

632
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:03,411
Thank you.

633
00:50:05,413 --> 00:50:06,789
Be careful.

634
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:11,878
Right!

635
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,296
Nezuko!

636
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:27,101
<i>The smell is overpowering!</i>

637
00:50:27,435 --> 00:50:28,352
<i>So heavy!</i>

638
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:32,356
<i>The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!</i>

639
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:35,359
<i>Was I asleep in such an awful scent?</i>

640
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:38,988
<i>Even if each car was closed off and airtight,</i>

641
00:50:39,322 --> 00:50:40,865
<i>I can't believe I was!</i>

642
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:42,700
<i>I was useless!</i>

643
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:45,077
<i>The demon's upwind...</i>

644
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:46,871
<i>Is he in the first car?</i>

645
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,001
Nezuko, don't come!

646
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,003
Stay away from me and wait!

647
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:56,172
Go wake everyone up!

648
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,265
What? You're awake?

649
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:08,100
Good morning!

650
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:12,188
You could've stayed asleep.

651
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:14,690
<i>It was him!</i>

652
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:17,610
Why did you wake up?

653
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:22,615
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

654
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:28,621
I could've shown you a dream
where your family was being slaughtered.

655
00:51:28,913 --> 00:51:31,374
Would you have liked that one better?

656
00:51:31,415 --> 00:51:34,043
No, of course not.
Too distressing, right?

657
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:38,840
All right, next...

658
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:43,094
Why don't I show you a dream
where your father comes back to life?

659
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,355
<i>What I really love...</i>

660
00:51:54,897 --> 00:52:01,362
<i>is to show people nightmares
right after a happy dream.</i>

661
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:06,117
<i>I just adore the sight
of a distorted human face.</i>

662
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:08,870
<i>I get such a kick out of that!</i>

663
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:18,129
<i>How enthralling is it to gaze at someone
shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?</i>

664
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:21,632
<i>But I don't usually let my guard down.</i>

665
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:26,637
<i>So, it may take longer,
but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers.</i>

666
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,849
<i>I mixed my blood
with the ink on the tickets.</i>

667
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:36,397
<i>Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...</i>

668
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,692
<i>the spell activates.</i>

669
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,489
<i>And yet...</i>

670
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:48,534
<i>how did this one manage to wake up?</i>

671
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:52,413
<i>And he found the way to wake up in a short time.</i>

672
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:59,837
<i>Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...</i>

673
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:04,467
is so enormous!

674
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:09,680
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

675
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:12,350
I won't let you...

676
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,143
get away with this!

677
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:20,149
<i>What's that? I see he's wearing earrings.</i>

678
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:25,363
How lucky is that?

679
00:53:25,696 --> 00:53:28,908
So, he came right to me!

680
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,577
This is like a dream!

681
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,165
Now I can receive
even more blood of Master Muzan!

682
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:40,253
And once I become more powerful,

683
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:45,174
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

684
00:53:47,802 --> 00:53:49,470
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

685
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:52,140
<i>Tenth Form...</i>

686
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:54,642
<i>Constant Flux!</i>

687
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:00,857
<i>Blood Demon Art!</i>

688
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:07,613
<i>Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.</i>

689
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:11,617
Go to sleep!

690
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:21,669
<i>He's not falling asleep.</i>

691
00:54:27,383 --> 00:54:28,301
Go to sleep.

692
00:54:35,892 --> 00:54:36,809
Go to sleep.

693
00:54:39,896 --> 00:54:40,897
Go to sleep!

694
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:42,190
Go to sleep!

695
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:51,657
Go... to... sleep!

696
00:54:53,201 --> 00:54:54,952
<i>It's not working. But why not?</i>

697
00:54:55,787 --> 00:54:57,580
<i>No, that's not what this is.</i>

698
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:02,001
<i>He's falling under this spell over and over!</i>

699
00:55:08,716 --> 00:55:11,928
<i>He's aware that he's under the spell right away.</i>

700
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:18,184
<i>And he's committing suicide
in order to awaken!</i>

701
00:55:23,898 --> 00:55:27,652
<i>Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...</i>

702
00:55:27,693 --> 00:55:30,571
<i>to take his own life with his own hands...</i>

703
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:33,324
<i>that takes incredible willpower!</i>

704
00:55:33,741 --> 00:55:35,243
<i>This brat...</i>

705
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:39,163
<i>is insane!</i>

706
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:52,635
Why didn't you save us?

707
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,518
What were you doing
while we were being murdered?

708
00:56:03,062 --> 00:56:07,275
How could you be the only one to survive?

709
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:17,869
Why do you think you were here?

710
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:20,288
You're so useless!

711
00:56:28,212 --> 00:56:31,007
It should've been you that died.

712
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:35,386
How dare you go on living
without a care.

713
00:56:42,727 --> 00:56:47,148
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

714
00:56:47,732 --> 00:56:49,525
Don't you dare...

715
00:56:50,151 --> 00:56:51,444
insult...

716
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:54,614
my family!

717
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,307
<i>It was way too easy.</i>

718
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:24,894
<i>Could this be a dream, too?</i>

719
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:29,273
<i>Or was this demon weaker than him?</i>

720
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:32,276
I can totally see why...

721
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,865
he ordered me to kill you,
the boy with the earrings,

722
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:42,036
along with the Hashira!

723
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:45,540
Your very existence is, like...

724
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,877
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

725
00:57:50,419 --> 00:57:51,629
<i>He's not dying?</i>

726
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:54,799
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

727
00:57:55,133 --> 00:57:58,219
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

728
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:04,976
You want to know why I'm not dead
after you decapitated me, don't you?

729
00:58:05,476 --> 00:58:09,564
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

730
00:58:10,148 --> 00:58:14,026
It's so easy
even an infant would understand.

731
00:58:16,195 --> 00:58:20,074
It's because the body over there
was no longer my main body.

732
00:58:20,658 --> 00:58:23,578
Same with this thing
that's talking to you now.

733
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:27,582
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

734
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:31,085
While you were snoozing away...

735
00:58:31,752 --> 00:58:34,964
I fused with this train!

736
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:43,097
Every inch of this train has become
my blood, my flesh and my bones!

737
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,641
Look at your face.

738
00:58:45,975 --> 00:58:48,853
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

739
00:58:49,645 --> 00:58:52,940
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

740
00:58:52,982 --> 00:58:56,903
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

741
00:58:57,361 --> 00:58:59,363
as well as my hostages.

742
00:58:59,947 --> 00:59:03,868
So, do you think
you can protect them by yourself?

743
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:10,124
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

744
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:13,961
Can you alone keep me
from devouring them?

745
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,429
<i>What should I do? What should I do?</i>

746
00:59:23,971 --> 00:59:27,099
<i>The most I can protect on my own is two cars!</i>

747
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:29,852
<i>Any more than that,
and I can't guarantee their safety!</i>

748
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:34,065
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

749
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:38,694
This is no time to be sleeping!
Wake up, will you? Please!

750
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:40,613
Nezuko!

751
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:43,449
Protect the sleeping passengers!

752
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:57,088
Follow me, damn minions!

753
00:59:57,421 --> 00:59:58,422
All right!

754
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:00,633
<i>Explosive Awakening!</i>

755
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:03,845
Comin' through!

756
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:07,557
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

757
01:00:07,598 --> 01:00:08,850
Inosuke!

758
01:00:09,183 --> 01:00:11,352
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

759
01:00:11,602 --> 01:00:13,604
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

760
01:00:13,896 --> 01:00:16,315
This whole train's turned into a demon!

761
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:19,610
Can you hear me?
This whole train is a demon!

762
01:00:21,529 --> 01:00:25,116
I knew it!
So, I was right on the money!

763
01:00:25,158 --> 01:00:29,162
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

764
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:36,419
<i>Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...</i>

765
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,921
<i>Crazy Cutting!</i>

766
01:00:43,718 --> 01:00:46,888
I'll save every last one of you guys!

767
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:49,015
Fall onto your knees...

768
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:51,184
and worship me!

769
01:00:51,476 --> 01:00:53,186
Glorify me!

770
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,524
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

771
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:01,277
I have to go save the passengers!

772
01:01:01,819 --> 01:01:05,364
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

773
01:01:30,473 --> 01:01:32,892
It's gone this far already?

774
01:01:35,895 --> 01:01:37,146
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

775
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:39,023
<i>First Form...</i>

776
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:40,775
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

777
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:44,862
<i>No good.</i>

778
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,198
<i>This is never going to end!</i>

779
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,534
<i>How am I supposed to fend it off?</i>

780
01:01:56,082 --> 01:02:01,546
<i>Damn Demon Slayer,
scurrying around inside me.</i>

781
01:02:01,963 --> 01:02:05,341
<i>You can cut all you want,
but I'll just keep regenerating.</i>

782
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:09,470
<i>And then, after all your strength is depleted...</i>

783
01:02:10,012 --> 01:02:16,144
<i>I'm going to partake of those
200 passengers in a leisurely feast.</i>

784
01:03:27,256 --> 01:03:28,841
<i>Thunder Breathing...</i>

785
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:30,968
<i>First Form...</i>

786
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,054
<i>Thunderclap and Flash!</i>

787
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:38,309
<i>Sixfold.</i>

788
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:40,061
I'll protect you...

789
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:42,313
Nezuko!

790
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:46,567
Protect...

791
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:54,992
<i>That sounded like thunder.</i>

792
01:03:55,451 --> 01:03:56,786
<i>From one of the cars in the back?</i>

793
01:03:56,828 --> 01:03:58,746
<i>What's going on?</i>

794
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:00,665
<i>Is Zenitsu awake now?</i>

795
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:02,583
<i>What about Rengoku?</i>

796
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:03,918
<i>And Nezuko?</i>

797
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,593
<i>I cannot do anything
but protect the people here!</i>

798
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:14,887
<i>This is bad! What should I do?</i>

799
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:16,556
<i>We can't fight in coordination!</i>

800
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:19,809
<i>Are the passengers in the back all right?</i>

801
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:21,227
<i>Damn!</i>

802
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:23,104
<i>It's so cramped!</i>

803
01:04:23,896 --> 01:04:25,898
<i>And so hard to swing my sword!</i>

804
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,409
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

805
01:04:37,034 --> 01:04:38,995
How could this be?

806
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:41,914
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

807
01:04:43,374 --> 01:04:44,750
If only I could crawl...

808
01:04:47,003 --> 01:04:48,421
under a rock!

809
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,596
What happened?

810
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:04,103
<i>What was that?</i>

811
01:05:04,145 --> 01:05:05,771
<i>A demon attack?</i>

812
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:09,567
Young Kamado!

813
01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:12,570
Rengoku!

814
01:05:12,904 --> 01:05:16,240
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

815
01:05:16,282 --> 01:05:18,910
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

816
01:05:19,243 --> 01:05:21,454
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

817
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:22,413
Okay!

818
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:24,665
This train has eight cars in all.

819
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:26,918
I'll protect the five in the rear.

820
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:31,172
The yellow boy and your sister
will be in charge of the rest.

821
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:33,007
You and the boar head boy...

822
01:05:33,049 --> 01:05:36,969
will go look for the demon's head
while keeping an eye on those three cars.

823
01:05:37,303 --> 01:05:38,262
Head?

824
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:39,680
But this demon is—

825
01:05:39,722 --> 01:05:43,518
No matter what form he's assumed,
so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

826
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,937
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

827
01:05:46,187 --> 01:05:48,064
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

828
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:54,070
<i>Amazing! I can't even see him!</i>

829
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:57,490
<i>Did the train shake earlier
because Rengoku was on the move?</i>

830
01:05:58,157 --> 01:06:00,993
<i>He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!</i>

831
01:06:01,285 --> 01:06:03,246
<i>Five cars, all by himself?</i>

832
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:08,334
<i>This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!</i>

833
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:12,213
<i>The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!</i>

834
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,467
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

835
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:18,553
Shut up, or I'll kill you!

836
01:06:18,594 --> 01:06:19,554
Up there, huh?

837
01:06:19,846 --> 01:06:22,598
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

838
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,726
But somehow...

839
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:27,728
Somehow...

840
01:06:28,604 --> 01:06:30,481
Somehow, he was awesome!

841
01:06:30,815 --> 01:06:33,317
I'm so pissed!

842
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:36,946
Inosuke! Keep an eye
on the three cars in the front!

843
01:06:37,196 --> 01:06:38,781
You don't have to tell me!

844
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:42,160
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

845
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:44,203
With my all-out Seventh Form...

846
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:46,330
I found this master's weak spot!

847
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:49,709
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

848
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,210
That's right, up front!

849
01:06:51,252 --> 01:06:54,088
And that front part
is a heck of a lot creepier!

850
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:58,050
<i>The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,</i>

851
01:06:58,092 --> 01:07:00,428
<i>but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!</i>

852
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:02,930
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

853
01:07:02,972 --> 01:07:03,973
That's right!

854
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:04,932
Understood!

855
01:07:05,475 --> 01:07:07,059
Okay, let's go!

856
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,561
Forward!

857
01:07:20,615 --> 01:07:22,074
This is it, huh?

858
01:07:26,454 --> 01:07:27,413
All right!

859
01:07:34,796 --> 01:07:35,880
Inosuke!

860
01:07:36,506 --> 01:07:39,133
Fishy, very fishy!

861
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:41,469
Especially around here!

862
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:42,887
Who the hell are you?

863
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:44,889
G-Get out of here!

864
01:07:45,389 --> 01:07:46,891
The demon's head...

865
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:48,392
The demon's...

866
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:50,144
weak spot!

867
01:07:55,399 --> 01:07:56,275
Gross!

868
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:58,611
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

869
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:02,532
That's way too many hands!

870
01:08:03,115 --> 01:08:04,075
Uh-oh!

871
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:09,831
<i>Water Breathing, Sixth Form...</i>

872
01:08:10,164 --> 01:08:11,332
<i>Whirlpool!</i>

873
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,925
Inosuke, are you all right?

874
01:08:20,967 --> 01:08:23,427
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

875
01:08:23,469 --> 01:08:24,470
Yeah, I know!

876
01:08:27,306 --> 01:08:28,432
<i>It's here...</i>

877
01:08:29,599 --> 01:08:30,893
<i>It's right beneath!</i>

878
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:33,019
<i>Directly below this place.</i>

879
01:08:33,062 --> 01:08:34,813
<i>The demon's scent is powerful!</i>

880
01:08:35,063 --> 01:08:37,900
Inosuke! The demon's head
is right below here!

881
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:40,778
Don't boss me around!
I'm the leader!

882
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,696
Fine!

883
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:43,447
Just watch.

884
01:08:43,781 --> 01:08:46,576
<i>Beast Breathing, Second Fang...</i>

885
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,704
<i>Slice!</i>

886
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:57,211
It's the bone.

887
01:08:57,628 --> 01:08:59,088
<i>His neck bone!</i>

888
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,550
<i>Water Breathing, Eighth Form...</i>

889
01:09:02,842 --> 01:09:03,885
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

890
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:09,724
<i>It blocked it!</i>

891
01:09:25,822 --> 01:09:27,450
<i>The gash is closing up!</i>

892
01:09:27,992 --> 01:09:29,744
<i>It's regenerating so fast!</i>

893
01:09:30,036 --> 01:09:34,415
<i>Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!</i>

894
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:36,501
<i>I have to sever it!</i>

895
01:09:37,001 --> 01:09:40,338
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

896
01:09:40,713 --> 01:09:45,050
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

897
01:09:45,092 --> 01:09:47,804
Sounds good! Great idea!

898
01:09:48,054 --> 01:09:49,304
I can praise you for that!

899
01:09:49,347 --> 01:09:50,473
Thanks!

900
01:09:52,099 --> 01:09:53,392
Let's go!

901
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:05,530
<i>Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.</i>

902
01:10:05,822 --> 01:10:07,031
<i>A Blood Demon Art!</i>

903
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,701
<i>He got me!
He's putting me to sleep!</i>

904
01:10:11,702 --> 01:10:15,039
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

905
01:10:15,081 --> 01:10:16,457
Then, you'll wake up!

906
01:10:21,254 --> 01:10:22,296
<i>It's all right!</i>

907
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,674
<i>Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!</i>

908
01:10:25,591 --> 01:10:30,680
<i>Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!</i>

909
01:10:31,931 --> 01:10:33,599
<i>Okay, I'm awake!</i>

910
01:10:39,897 --> 01:10:44,402
<i>Damn! Even though I'm awake,
I can't avoid looking at the eyes!</i>

911
01:10:44,694 --> 01:10:47,196
<i>I have to wake up with my eyes shut!</i>

912
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:49,031
<i>With my eyes shut!</i>

913
01:10:51,033 --> 01:10:51,826
<i>No good!</i>

914
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,161
<i>Wake up!</i>

915
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:54,912
<i>Wake up!</i>

916
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:55,913
<i>Hurry!</i>

917
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,415
<i>Cut the neck!</i>

918
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,417
<i>Cut it! Cut it!</i>

919
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:01,502
<i>I have to wake up!</i>

920
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:04,672
<i>Hurry!</i>

921
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:07,508
<i>Wake up!</i>

922
01:11:11,387 --> 01:11:13,347
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

923
01:11:13,723 --> 01:11:15,558
Don't fall for his trap!

924
01:11:15,892 --> 01:11:18,102
Don't die such lame deaths!

925
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,610
I'm wearing the hide
of the mountain god on my head.

926
01:11:25,943 --> 01:11:28,779
I bet he's too scared
to look me in the eye!

927
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:31,908
You loser eyeballs!

928
01:11:32,241 --> 01:11:36,954
<i>I see. He's having a hard time
telling which way Inosuke's looking!</i>

929
01:11:37,246 --> 01:11:41,042
All right, now all we gotta do
is slash this thing to death!

930
01:11:45,505 --> 01:11:46,464
Inosuke!

931
01:11:46,798 --> 01:11:49,842
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

932
01:11:56,891 --> 01:11:58,351
Did you get stabbed?

933
01:11:58,392 --> 01:11:59,769
I'm okay.

934
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:04,232
Just forget about that bastard!

935
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:06,734
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

936
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:11,572
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

937
01:12:11,906 --> 01:12:14,033
I know! Let's get moving!

938
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:32,218
Inosuke!

939
01:12:32,844 --> 01:12:34,345
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

940
01:12:34,387 --> 01:12:36,264
And let's chop off the demon's head!

941
01:12:36,597 --> 01:12:38,141
Let's attack together!

942
01:13:13,718 --> 01:13:16,095
<i>No good! If I fall asleep now...</i>

943
01:13:16,387 --> 01:13:17,597
Damn you!

944
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:20,099
C'mon! Follow me!

945
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:23,102
<i>Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...</i>

946
01:13:26,189 --> 01:13:27,815
<i>Slice 'n' Dice!</i>

947
01:13:31,694 --> 01:13:34,155
<i>Father, please protect me!</i>

948
01:13:34,697 --> 01:13:37,742
<i>I'm going to sever that bone...</i>

949
01:13:38,659 --> 01:13:39,786
<i>with this blow!</i>

950
01:13:40,036 --> 01:13:41,913
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

951
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,583
<i>Clear Blue Sky!</i>

952
01:14:06,687 --> 01:14:09,148
Because of its screams and tremors,

953
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:10,399
the train's turning over!

954
01:14:10,608 --> 01:14:12,026
Are you okay, Inosuke?

955
01:14:12,235 --> 01:14:14,904
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

956
01:14:14,946 --> 01:14:16,239
Y-Yeah!

957
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,908
Inosuke, protect the passen—

958
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:21,994
<i>I can't die.</i>

959
01:14:22,787 --> 01:14:26,541
<i>If I die, that'll make him a murderer!</i>

960
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:27,959
<i>I can't die!</i>

961
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:32,755
<i>I don't want to let anyone die!</i>

962
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:01,951
Are you okay, Santaro?

963
01:15:04,078 --> 01:15:05,913
Hang in there!

964
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:08,916
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

965
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,835
Cool, huh?

966
01:15:11,169 --> 01:15:12,753
Is your belly okay?

967
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:14,797
Your belly that got stabbed!

968
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:16,132
I'm...

969
01:15:16,466 --> 01:15:18,092
all right.

970
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:19,844
What about you?

971
01:15:20,094 --> 01:15:23,264
Never felt better!
I didn't even catch a cold!

972
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,851
I won't be able to move for a while.

973
01:15:28,102 --> 01:15:30,771
Help the others, will you?

974
01:15:32,106 --> 01:15:34,192
Was anyone injured?

975
01:15:35,318 --> 01:15:38,821
What about the engineer near the head?

976
01:15:41,157 --> 01:15:43,326
It's okay if that bastard dies!

977
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,745
It's not okay.

978
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:48,372
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

979
01:15:48,414 --> 01:15:51,834
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

980
01:15:52,126 --> 01:15:54,504
His leg's shattered,
and he can't walk anymore!

981
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:56,005
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

982
01:15:56,422 --> 01:16:00,134
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

983
01:16:00,635 --> 01:16:02,595
Help him, will you?

984
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:05,848
Please.

985
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:14,732
I'll go for you, then!

986
01:16:14,774 --> 01:16:16,442
Because I'm the boss!

987
01:16:16,776 --> 01:16:18,694
Because my minion asked me to!

988
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:23,115
After I rescue him,
I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

989
01:16:23,866 --> 01:16:27,036
That's really not necessary.

990
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:33,626
<i>It's almost dawn.</i>

991
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:37,046
<i>Get your breathing under control.</i>

992
01:16:38,172 --> 01:16:39,298
<i>We have to...</i>

993
01:16:39,924 --> 01:16:41,300
<i>save the injured...</i>

994
01:16:41,926 --> 01:16:43,427
<i>before it's too late.</i>

995
01:16:45,221 --> 01:16:46,514
<i>Nezuko...</i>

996
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:48,141
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

997
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:49,934
<i>Rengoku...</i>

998
01:16:51,435 --> 01:16:53,479
<i>I'm sure they're all safe!</i>

999
01:16:53,938 --> 01:16:55,481
<i>You have to believe!</i>

1000
01:17:02,196 --> 01:17:04,157
<i>My body's disintegrating.</i>

1001
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,284
<i>I can't regenerate.</i>

1002
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:10,371
<i>Did I lose? Am I going to die?</i>

1003
01:17:10,705 --> 01:17:11,914
<i>Me?</i>

1004
01:17:12,206 --> 01:17:13,166
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

1005
01:17:13,499 --> 01:17:17,170
<i>Ridiculous!
I haven't been able to go all out!</i>

1006
01:17:17,628 --> 01:17:20,631
<i>I couldn't devour a single human!</i>

1007
01:17:20,673 --> 01:17:26,179
<i>My plan to fuse with the train and devour
humans en masse just went up in smoke!</i>

1008
01:17:26,429 --> 01:17:29,182
<i>And now, look what I've been reduced to!</i>

1009
01:17:29,432 --> 01:17:32,727
<i>After all the time and trouble I've taken!</i>

1010
01:17:33,269 --> 01:17:34,687
<i>It was him!</i>

1011
01:17:34,937 --> 01:17:36,814
<i>It's all his fault!</i>

1012
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:42,612
<i>Even though I'd taken
200 humans hostage, still I struggled!</i>

1013
01:17:42,653 --> 01:17:44,113
<i>I was held at bay!</i>

1014
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:46,949
<i>Is this the power of a Hashira?</i>

1015
01:17:47,366 --> 01:17:50,286
<i>And him... He was fast, too.</i>

1016
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:53,706
<i>Even though he never broke
the spell completely!</i>

1017
01:17:53,748 --> 01:17:58,252
<i>Not to mention that girl!
She's a demon! What's that about?</i>

1018
01:17:58,294 --> 01:18:00,630
<i>A demon, joining forces
with Demon Slayers?</i>

1019
01:18:00,671 --> 01:18:03,966
<i>Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?</i>

1020
01:18:05,343 --> 01:18:07,970
<i>Dammit! Dammit!</i>

1021
01:18:08,387 --> 01:18:09,764
<i>In the first place...</i>

1022
01:18:10,056 --> 01:18:14,519
<i>it all started going downhill
once that brat broke my spell!</i>

1023
01:18:14,852 --> 01:18:17,230
<i>That brat is to blame!</i>

1024
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:21,108
<i>I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!</i>

1025
01:18:21,609 --> 01:18:24,028
<i>That's right, and that boar, too!</i>

1026
01:18:24,362 --> 01:18:27,824
<i>I could've at least killed that brat!</i>

1027
01:18:27,865 --> 01:18:32,036
<i>But that boar thwarted me.
His intuition is extraordinary.</i>

1028
01:18:32,078 --> 01:18:34,288
<i>He could sense my gaze!</i>

1029
01:18:35,832 --> 01:18:37,375
<i>Am I going to lose?</i>

1030
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:39,669
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

1031
01:18:40,294 --> 01:18:45,049
<i>Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!</i>

1032
01:18:46,425 --> 01:18:51,055
<i>It's always the bottom-feeder demons
who get killed by the Demon Slayers.</i>

1033
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:52,682
<i>In the Upper Ranks...</i>

1034
01:18:52,723 --> 01:18:56,394
<i>the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.</i>

1035
01:18:56,435 --> 01:19:01,399
<i>They're strong enough to defeat Hashira
who've killed an untold number of demons.</i>

1036
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:04,402
<i>Do they have otherworldly powers?</i>

1037
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:10,283
<i>Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!</i>

1038
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:15,413
<i>I want to do it over!
I want to do it over!</i>

1039
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:21,127
<i>What a miserable nightmare this is...</i>

1040
01:19:28,426 --> 01:19:30,970
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1041
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:32,930
Impressive!

1042
01:19:34,056 --> 01:19:35,600
Rengoku...

1043
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:39,061
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1044
01:19:39,312 --> 01:19:42,440
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1045
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:45,109
I'll do my best.

1046
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:47,987
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1047
01:19:48,571 --> 01:19:51,782
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1048
01:19:52,116 --> 01:19:55,286
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1049
01:19:55,995 --> 01:19:57,288
There's a blood vessel.

1050
01:19:57,705 --> 01:19:59,332
A torn blood vessel.

1051
01:20:03,294 --> 01:20:04,670
Concentrate harder!

1052
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,727
That's it. Stanch it.
Stop the bleeding.

1053
01:20:25,066 --> 01:20:26,400
Focus!

1054
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:38,412
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1055
01:20:38,663 --> 01:20:42,333
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1056
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,002
Not that you'll be able to do everything,

1057
01:20:45,419 --> 01:20:49,423
but you'll become a stronger version
of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1058
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,176
Right.

1059
01:20:54,053 --> 01:20:55,304
Everyone's safe!

1060
01:20:55,638 --> 01:20:58,516
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1061
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:03,354
Don't strain yourself.
Take it easy and rest up.

1062
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:09,277
Thank you very much.

1063
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:41,559
<i>Upper... Three?</i>

1064
01:21:42,268 --> 01:21:44,270
<i>What's he doing here and now?</i>

1065
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:59,202
<i>Flame Breathing, Second Form...</i>

1066
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:03,122
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

1067
01:22:13,299 --> 01:22:14,967
That's a fine sword.

1068
01:22:17,178 --> 01:22:18,763
<i>He sure can regenerate fast.</i>

1069
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:21,474
<i>This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...</i>

1070
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:23,226
<i>So, this is an Upper Rank.</i>

1071
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,772
I can't understand why you'd go
after a wounded person first.

1072
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:33,110
He could get in the way
of the chitchat... of you and me.

1073
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:35,696
What would you and I have to talk about?

1074
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:40,118
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1075
01:22:40,409 --> 01:22:44,497
Is that right?
Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1076
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:47,458
The sight of a weakling
makes my skin crawl.

1077
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,046
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1078
01:22:53,506 --> 01:22:56,300
All right, then I have
a brilliant proposal for you.

1079
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:59,137
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1080
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:00,638
I will not.

1081
01:23:01,305 --> 01:23:04,433
I can tell your strength at a glance.

1082
01:23:04,475 --> 01:23:06,102
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1083
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:08,896
Your fighting spirit
has been honed to the hilt.

1084
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:11,566
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1085
01:23:11,941 --> 01:23:15,736
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1086
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:18,197
I'm Akaza.

1087
01:23:18,531 --> 01:23:19,532
Kyojuro...

1088
01:23:19,991 --> 01:23:24,704
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1089
01:23:25,037 --> 01:23:26,539
Because you're a human.

1090
01:23:27,081 --> 01:23:29,834
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1091
01:23:31,544 --> 01:23:33,963
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1092
01:23:34,797 --> 01:23:39,343
Do that, and you can go on training
for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1093
01:23:39,385 --> 01:23:40,970
You can become stronger.

1094
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:47,477
<i>Of all the demons that I've met until now,
he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!</i>

1095
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:49,729
<i>I have to help him fight!</i>

1096
01:23:50,771 --> 01:23:57,195
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1097
01:23:57,487 --> 01:24:00,698
The fact that we grow old and die

1098
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:04,243
is what makes human life
so unbearably precious and noble.

1099
01:24:05,536 --> 01:24:10,333
"Strength" isn't a word
used to describe just the body.

1100
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,506
This boy isn't weak!

1101
01:24:17,965 --> 01:24:19,634
Don't insult him.

1102
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:21,636
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1103
01:24:21,677 --> 01:24:24,931
You and I have different senses of value.

1104
01:24:25,598 --> 01:24:29,519
No matter what the reason,
I will not become a demon!

1105
01:24:34,357 --> 01:24:36,025
I see.

1106
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:39,821
<i>Technique Development...</i>

1107
01:24:41,614 --> 01:24:43,866
<i>Destructive Death... Compass Needle!</i>

1108
01:24:58,798 --> 01:25:01,384
If you refuse to become a demon,
I'll kill you.

1109
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:18,067
<i>I can't follow their movements!</i>

1110
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:22,029
There were never any Flames
among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1111
01:25:22,738 --> 01:25:25,783
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1112
01:25:30,246 --> 01:25:32,081
Why do you think that is?

1113
01:25:32,123 --> 01:25:36,419
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1114
01:25:37,003 --> 01:25:40,339
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1115
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:49,682
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1116
01:25:49,724 --> 01:25:52,059
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1117
01:25:52,852 --> 01:25:54,812
Die, Kyojuro...

1118
01:25:55,062 --> 01:25:56,898
while you're still young and strong.

1119
01:25:59,567 --> 01:26:00,818
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

1120
01:26:02,069 --> 01:26:03,404
<i>Air Type!</i>

1121
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:17,668
<i>I see.</i>

1122
01:26:20,004 --> 01:26:21,714
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

1123
01:26:21,923 --> 01:26:23,174
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

1124
01:26:23,216 --> 01:26:25,301
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

1125
01:26:27,512 --> 01:26:30,640
<i>When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!</i>

1126
01:26:33,893 --> 01:26:36,187
<i>He can move
faster than the blink of an eye.</i>

1127
01:26:42,193 --> 01:26:47,031
<i>If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.</i>

1128
01:26:47,073 --> 01:26:48,324
<i>In that case...</i>

1129
01:26:53,746 --> 01:26:55,039
<i>I'll just have to get up close!</i>

1130
01:26:56,124 --> 01:26:58,668
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1131
01:27:01,504 --> 01:27:04,632
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1132
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:06,175
Kyojuro!

1133
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:07,718
Doesn't that make you sad?

1134
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:09,137
It happens to everyone!

1135
01:27:09,428 --> 01:27:11,597
It's a fact of life for any human!

1136
01:27:13,182 --> 01:27:14,600
Stay where you are!

1137
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:16,894
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1138
01:27:17,311 --> 01:27:18,479
Stand back! That's an order!

1139
01:27:19,689 --> 01:27:21,858
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1140
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:23,734
Come on, give me your best shot!

1141
01:27:27,071 --> 01:27:28,739
Concentrate on me.

1142
01:27:41,043 --> 01:27:42,503
Nice moves!

1143
01:27:48,676 --> 01:27:49,927
Rengoku!

1144
01:27:49,969 --> 01:27:51,345
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1145
01:27:54,891 --> 01:27:57,602
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1146
01:28:01,397 --> 01:28:05,735
Fight me forever
and get stronger together with me.

1147
01:28:09,614 --> 01:28:12,074
You have what it takes to do that!

1148
01:28:13,993 --> 01:28:15,328
I'll pass!

1149
01:28:15,661 --> 01:28:19,040
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1150
01:28:22,627 --> 01:28:24,796
I will not become a demon!

1151
01:28:25,254 --> 01:28:26,255
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

1152
01:28:28,174 --> 01:28:29,425
<i>Third Form...</i>

1153
01:28:30,134 --> 01:28:31,719
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

1154
01:28:34,722 --> 01:28:36,641
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1155
01:28:38,476 --> 01:28:39,644
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

1156
01:28:39,685 --> 01:28:40,770
<i>Air Type!</i>

1157
01:28:49,278 --> 01:28:50,738
<i>There's no opening.</i>

1158
01:28:51,072 --> 01:28:52,240
<i>I can't jump in.</i>

1159
01:28:52,573 --> 01:28:55,076
<i>I can't keep up
with the speed of their movements!</i>

1160
01:28:55,118 --> 01:28:57,870
<i>Those two are in a different dimension!</i>

1161
01:28:58,121 --> 01:29:02,250
<i>Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!</i>

1162
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:04,252
<i>I can't move...</i>

1163
01:29:04,502 --> 01:29:08,172
<i>because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!</i>

1164
01:29:11,008 --> 01:29:12,635
Rengoku...

1165
01:29:16,973 --> 01:29:18,683
You still don't get it?

1166
01:29:19,016 --> 01:29:24,355
That if you continue attacking,
you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1167
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:35,408
<i>Flame Breathing, First Form...</i>

1168
01:29:35,658 --> 01:29:36,701
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

1169
01:29:39,162 --> 01:29:41,330
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1170
01:29:41,706 --> 01:29:44,041
You haven't reached
your physical peak yet!

1171
01:29:50,006 --> 01:29:51,007
<i>Second Form...</i>

1172
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:54,051
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

1173
01:29:55,511 --> 01:30:00,266
In a year or two, you'll have polished your skills
even more, and you'll have greater precision!

1174
01:30:12,528 --> 01:30:13,738
<i>Third Form...</i>

1175
01:30:13,988 --> 01:30:15,448
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

1176
01:30:16,866 --> 01:30:17,950
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

1177
01:30:18,201 --> 01:30:20,286
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

1178
01:30:22,497 --> 01:30:24,415
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

1179
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:27,001
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

1180
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:28,711
<i>Flame Tiger!</i>

1181
01:30:32,215 --> 01:30:33,800
<i>Disorder!</i>

1182
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:39,430
Kyojuro!

1183
01:30:56,113 --> 01:30:58,533
Did he do it? Did he win?

1184
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:28,604
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

1185
01:31:35,153 --> 01:31:36,654
<i>No way!</i>

1186
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:46,664
Let's fight more.

1187
01:31:47,457 --> 01:31:49,834
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1188
01:32:05,892 --> 01:32:07,310
<i>Rengoku...</i>

1189
01:32:08,144 --> 01:32:09,604
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1190
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:13,524
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1191
01:32:18,404 --> 01:32:24,744
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1192
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:32,210
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1193
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,504
But what about you?

1194
01:32:34,545 --> 01:32:39,467
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs
and damaged internal organs...

1195
01:32:39,509 --> 01:32:41,719
All irreparable.

1196
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:44,847
If you were a demon,
you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1197
01:32:45,181 --> 01:32:48,601
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1198
01:32:48,851 --> 01:32:52,814
You can struggle all you want,
but a human can never beat a demon.

1199
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:57,318
<i>I want to go help him!</i>

1200
01:33:00,029 --> 01:33:02,490
<i>But there's no strength in my arms or legs.</i>

1201
01:33:02,824 --> 01:33:04,867
<i>It's partly because of my injury,</i>

1202
01:33:04,909 --> 01:33:07,954
<i>but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!</i>

1203
01:33:21,467 --> 01:33:23,678
Kyojuro, why...

1204
01:33:25,429 --> 01:33:26,264
I...

1205
01:33:28,099 --> 01:33:30,685
I will fulfill my duty!

1206
01:33:30,935 --> 01:33:34,313
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1207
01:33:35,606 --> 01:33:39,152
<i>I'll damage his body
as much as I can in an instant!</i>

1208
01:33:39,402 --> 01:33:40,570
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

1209
01:33:41,154 --> 01:33:42,405
<i>Esoteric Art!</i>

1210
01:33:48,369 --> 01:33:50,705
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1211
01:33:50,746 --> 01:33:53,624
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1212
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:55,668
That mental strength!

1213
01:33:55,918 --> 01:33:58,671
That airtight stance!

1214
01:34:01,048 --> 01:34:04,677
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1215
01:34:04,927 --> 01:34:07,930
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1216
01:34:08,264 --> 01:34:09,765
<i>Set your heart ablaze.</i>

1217
01:34:10,766 --> 01:34:12,518
<i>Go beyond your limits!</i>

1218
01:34:13,728 --> 01:34:15,730
I'm the Flame Hashira...

1219
01:34:16,063 --> 01:34:17,773
Kyojuro Rengoku!

1220
01:34:18,483 --> 01:34:19,692
Ninth Form...

1221
01:34:20,443 --> 01:34:22,153
Rengoku!

1222
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:23,654
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

1223
01:34:23,946 --> 01:34:25,281
<i>Annihilation Type!</i>

1224
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,674
Rengoku!

1225
01:35:16,916 --> 01:35:18,084
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1226
01:35:23,339 --> 01:35:24,841
<i>Rengoku!</i>

1227
01:35:27,301 --> 01:35:28,511
I see hi—

1228
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:29,595
Ren...

1229
01:35:29,929 --> 01:35:30,972
goku...

1230
01:35:41,732 --> 01:35:45,194
You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro!

1231
01:35:45,403 --> 01:35:46,904
Become a demon!

1232
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:48,906
Say that you'll become a demon!

1233
01:35:48,948 --> 01:35:50,199
You are...

1234
01:35:50,575 --> 01:35:53,578
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1235
01:36:06,549 --> 01:36:07,675
Kyojuro...

1236
01:36:07,717 --> 01:36:09,469
Yes, Mother?

1237
01:36:10,511 --> 01:36:12,513
I want you to think hard...

1238
01:36:12,847 --> 01:36:15,141
about what I'm about to ask you.

1239
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:21,105
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1240
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:26,360
I don't know!

1241
01:36:27,111 --> 01:36:29,864
So that you can save weaker people.

1242
01:36:31,324 --> 01:36:36,412
Those who were born
blessed with more gifts than others

1243
01:36:36,454 --> 01:36:42,376
are obligated to use those gifts
for the world and other people.

1244
01:36:43,252 --> 01:36:51,135
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1245
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:57,350
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1246
01:36:58,059 --> 01:37:02,355
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1247
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:06,818
Make sure you never forget that.

1248
01:37:06,859 --> 01:37:08,402
I won't!

1249
01:37:25,002 --> 01:37:28,965
I don't have much more time to live.

1250
01:37:29,966 --> 01:37:34,679
I was blessed to be the mother
of such a strong and gentle child.

1251
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:38,516
I will entrust everything to you.

1252
01:37:51,654 --> 01:37:52,822
<i>Mother...</i>

1253
01:37:53,156 --> 01:37:58,244
<i>It was an honor for me
to have been born to such a person as you!</i>

1254
01:38:06,252 --> 01:38:07,378
<i>He stopped it?</i>

1255
01:38:07,795 --> 01:38:10,131
<i>What unbelievable strength!</i>

1256
01:38:10,173 --> 01:38:13,384
<i>I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!</i>

1257
01:38:15,052 --> 01:38:16,512
<i>Damn!</i>

1258
01:38:16,804 --> 01:38:18,347
<i>It'll be daybreak soon!</i>

1259
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:21,684
<i>I have to kill him and get out of here!</i>

1260
01:38:22,977 --> 01:38:23,936
<i>I can't...</i>

1261
01:38:23,978 --> 01:38:25,271
<i>pull my arm out!</i>

1262
01:38:27,607 --> 01:38:29,734
<i>I won't let you escape!</i>

1263
01:38:36,616 --> 01:38:39,827
<i>No matter what Rengoku says...</i>

1264
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:42,538
<i>I have to...</i>

1265
01:38:42,872 --> 01:38:44,248
<i>do it right now!</i>

1266
01:38:45,082 --> 01:38:48,211
<i>I have to slice off the demon's head!</i>

1267
01:38:48,544 --> 01:38:49,754
<i>Quickly!</i>

1268
01:38:52,548 --> 01:38:54,300
<i>The sun's coming up!</i>

1269
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:57,053
<i>There'll be sunlight here!</i>

1270
01:38:57,386 --> 01:38:58,554
<i>I have to get away!</i>

1271
01:38:58,846 --> 01:39:00,556
<i>I have to get away!</i>

1272
01:39:09,982 --> 01:39:12,026
<i>No way am I ever letting go!</i>

1273
01:39:12,068 --> 01:39:15,071
<i>Not until I chop off your head!</i>

1274
01:39:18,032 --> 01:39:20,243
Out of my way!

1275
01:39:24,747 --> 01:39:26,666
Move, Inosuke!

1276
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:30,336
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1277
01:39:33,798 --> 01:39:36,425
<i>Beast Breathing, Fang One...</i>

1278
01:39:36,884 --> 01:39:38,469
<i>Pierce!</i>

1279
01:39:56,863 --> 01:39:59,991
<i>I have to find refuge from the sunlight!</i>

1280
01:40:10,168 --> 01:40:11,711
<i>That took too long!</i>

1281
01:40:11,752 --> 01:40:13,921
<i>I have to get away from the sun!</i>

1282
01:40:21,012 --> 01:40:22,638
Don't run away!

1283
01:40:23,222 --> 01:40:25,016
Don't run away, you coward!

1284
01:40:25,057 --> 01:40:27,185
Don't run away!

1285
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,773
<i>What the hell is that brat talking about?</i>

1286
01:40:32,815 --> 01:40:35,401
<i>Doesn't he have a brain in his head?</i>

1287
01:40:35,443 --> 01:40:38,112
<i>I'm not running away from you!</i>

1288
01:40:38,446 --> 01:40:40,656
<i>I'm running away from the sun!</i>

1289
01:40:40,698 --> 01:40:43,951
<i>And besides,
the battle's already been decided!</i>

1290
01:40:44,243 --> 01:40:47,622
<i>He'll run out of strength and die soon!</i>

1291
01:40:50,166 --> 01:40:51,876
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1292
01:40:52,251 --> 01:40:56,380
is always fighting you demons in the dark
of the night where you have the advantage!

1293
01:40:56,422 --> 01:40:58,549
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1294
01:40:58,841 --> 01:41:00,968
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1295
01:41:01,219 --> 01:41:03,805
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1296
01:41:04,806 --> 01:41:06,641
Don't run away, you bastard!

1297
01:41:07,099 --> 01:41:08,309
You bastard!

1298
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:10,394
You coward!

1299
01:41:10,645 --> 01:41:14,941
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1300
01:41:14,982 --> 01:41:16,692
He's stronger!

1301
01:41:16,943 --> 01:41:18,611
Rengoku didn't lose!

1302
01:41:18,861 --> 01:41:20,863
He didn't let anybody die!

1303
01:41:20,905 --> 01:41:24,492
He fought to the end!
He protected them to the end!

1304
01:41:24,534 --> 01:41:26,619
You're the one who lost!

1305
01:41:26,661 --> 01:41:30,498
It's Rengoku who won!

1306
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:07,410
Stop yelling already.

1307
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:15,084
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1308
01:42:15,751 --> 01:42:17,795
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1309
01:42:19,005 --> 01:42:21,174
If you die, young Kamado,

1310
01:42:21,632 --> 01:42:23,801
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1311
01:42:25,761 --> 01:42:27,263
Rengoku...

1312
01:42:28,556 --> 01:42:29,974
Come over here.

1313
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:32,810
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1314
01:42:50,828 --> 01:42:52,830
There's something that I remembered...

1315
01:42:54,373 --> 01:42:56,709
while I was dreaming.

1316
01:42:57,835 --> 01:42:59,545
You should go to my parents' home,

1317
01:43:00,171 --> 01:43:02,799
the Rengoku residence.

1318
01:43:03,758 --> 01:43:07,261
There should be some notes there
left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1319
01:43:09,055 --> 01:43:11,224
My father read them often,

1320
01:43:12,099 --> 01:43:15,686
but since I never did,
I don't know what's in them.

1321
01:43:17,647 --> 01:43:25,655
There might be some kind of record
of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1322
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:30,618
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1323
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,995
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1324
01:43:33,037 --> 01:43:35,331
Isn't there a way
to close up your wounds?

1325
01:43:36,082 --> 01:43:37,250
No.

1326
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:39,961
I'll be dead soon.

1327
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:45,633
I'm going to tell you all I can
while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1328
01:43:47,468 --> 01:43:49,637
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1329
01:43:50,388 --> 01:43:52,306
to follow his heart...

1330
01:43:52,849 --> 01:43:57,061
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1331
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,065
Tell my father...

1332
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:04,610
that I want him to take care of himself.

1333
01:44:06,737 --> 01:44:07,864
One more thing.

1334
01:44:09,031 --> 01:44:10,158
Young Kamado...

1335
01:44:12,743 --> 01:44:15,163
I believe in your little sister.

1336
01:44:16,122 --> 01:44:18,708
I accept her as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1337
01:44:21,085 --> 01:44:26,382
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1338
01:44:27,383 --> 01:44:31,179
Anyone who risks their lives
fighting demons to protect humans...

1339
01:44:31,554 --> 01:44:35,308
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1340
01:44:36,142 --> 01:44:38,394
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1341
01:44:43,399 --> 01:44:48,905
No matter how devastated you may be
by your own weakness or uselessness...

1342
01:44:50,323 --> 01:44:51,991
set your heart ablaze.

1343
01:44:55,077 --> 01:44:57,413
Grit your teeth
and look straight ahead.

1344
01:44:58,873 --> 01:45:01,918
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1345
01:45:01,959 --> 01:45:04,879
the time won't wait for you...

1346
01:45:04,921 --> 01:45:08,883
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1347
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:13,179
Don't feel bad
that I'm going to die here.

1348
01:45:13,805 --> 01:45:15,223
As a Hashira,

1349
01:45:15,556 --> 01:45:18,434
of course I would shield my juniors.

1350
01:45:18,976 --> 01:45:22,980
Any other Hashira
would've done the same thing.

1351
01:45:23,815 --> 01:45:25,942
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1352
01:45:27,235 --> 01:45:28,569
Young Kamado...

1353
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:31,823
Young Boar Head...

1354
01:45:32,824 --> 01:45:34,116
Yellow Boy...

1355
01:45:35,743 --> 01:45:37,745
Keep learning and grow.

1356
01:45:38,538 --> 01:45:39,914
And then,

1357
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:43,918
become the next Hashira
supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1358
01:45:45,419 --> 01:45:46,754
I believe in you.

1359
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,299
I believe in you all.

1360
01:46:16,117 --> 01:46:17,535
<i>Mother...</i>

1361
01:46:22,165 --> 01:46:24,375
<i>Do you think I did it right?</i>

1362
01:46:26,669 --> 01:46:30,173
<i>Did I carry out what I had to do...</i>

1363
01:46:30,798 --> 01:46:32,592
<i>and my duties?</i>

1364
01:46:41,976 --> 01:46:44,395
<i>You made me proud.</i>

1365
01:47:20,807 --> 01:47:23,059
When the train went off the rails,

1366
01:47:23,476 --> 01:47:26,145
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques.

1367
01:47:26,771 --> 01:47:31,067
He must've kept the damage
to the cars to a minimum.

1368
01:47:32,985 --> 01:47:34,612
I guess he did.

1369
01:47:36,113 --> 01:47:38,407
I can't believe he's gone.

1370
01:47:39,033 --> 01:47:41,702
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1371
01:47:41,994 --> 01:47:42,912
Yeah.

1372
01:47:43,746 --> 01:47:46,082
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1373
01:47:46,749 --> 01:47:49,752
Was it that strong? I mean...

1374
01:47:50,169 --> 01:47:51,337
Yeah.

1375
01:47:53,756 --> 01:47:55,925
I'm so frustrated!

1376
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:00,012
As soon as I master one thing,

1377
01:48:00,972 --> 01:48:05,476
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1378
01:48:07,019 --> 01:48:11,941
while more powerful people
are fighting far beyond it.

1379
01:48:12,817 --> 01:48:15,444
I just can't make it there yet!

1380
01:48:16,821 --> 01:48:20,408
If I'm still stumbling around
in a place like this, can I...

1381
01:48:21,325 --> 01:48:22,702
Can I...

1382
01:48:25,496 --> 01:48:29,750
ever become like Rengoku?

1383
01:48:40,011 --> 01:48:42,513
Stop whining already!

1384
01:48:44,265 --> 01:48:48,478
Stop saying dumbass things
like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1385
01:48:48,519 --> 01:48:53,733
He said he believes in you, so just think
about how you're going to measure up to that!

1386
01:48:53,774 --> 01:48:57,528
All living things just go back
to the earth when they die!

1387
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:01,032
Sobbing or sniveling
won't bring them back!

1388
01:49:01,324 --> 01:49:03,785
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1389
01:49:04,118 --> 01:49:07,371
No matter how pathetic
or humiliated you feel,

1390
01:49:07,413 --> 01:49:09,791
you still have to go on living!

1391
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,667
But you're crying, too.

1392
01:49:12,251 --> 01:49:15,421
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1393
01:49:16,297 --> 01:49:18,424
I'm not crying!

1394
01:49:28,976 --> 01:49:31,687
Get over here!
We're gonna train!

1395
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:17,400
Is that so...

1396
01:50:17,775 --> 01:50:19,735
Rengoku...

1397
01:50:39,714 --> 01:50:44,385
So, even Rengoku couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1398
01:50:49,557 --> 01:50:51,392
I don't believe it.

1399
01:50:58,357 --> 01:51:00,485
Namu Amida Butsu.

1400
01:51:06,866 --> 01:51:11,496
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1401
01:51:19,295 --> 01:51:20,588
I see.

1402
01:51:30,097 --> 01:51:34,936
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?

1403
01:51:35,603 --> 01:51:37,939
Kyojuro did a great job, then.

1404
01:51:38,314 --> 01:51:40,149
What a remarkable child.

1405
01:51:41,567 --> 01:51:43,486
I'm not sad.

1406
01:51:43,903 --> 01:51:46,823
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1407
01:51:49,617 --> 01:51:52,995
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1408
