1
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,605
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:41,994
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:47,500
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,963
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:56,425
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:56,675 --> 00:02:00,596
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:06,018
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,999
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:33,087
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,758
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,053
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:43,931
There you go.

13
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:53,899
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:59,363
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,534
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:08,747
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:10,708
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:15,212
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:20,426
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:37,943
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,290
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:54,460
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,022
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,151
Now!

25
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:36,210
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:52,685
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,690
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:02,862
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,990
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:11,203
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,541
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,213
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,633
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:28,721
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,432
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,020
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,611
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,741
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,453
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,706
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,209
Get in.

42
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:07,802
Make it move.

43
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,181
Move!

44
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:14,892
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,645
He's boring.

46
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:21,524
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:25,444
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,824
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:35,246
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:41,794
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,671
Do you...?

52
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,008
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:52,429
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,932
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,523
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:07,736
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,845
Thanks.

58
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,472
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,727
Snake!

60
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:58,537
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,916
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:07,505
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:17,681
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,353
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:26,440
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,656
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,112
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,532
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

69
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,493
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:55,321
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,336
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,883
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,619
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:48,916
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:53,546
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,507
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,846
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,393
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,697
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

80
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,419
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:37,131
Stop it!

82
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,221
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,979
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,358
Get off!

85
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:04,283
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,120
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:12,458
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,920
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,124
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,267
Who's there?

91
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,865
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:37,334
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:43,048
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,766
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:56,520
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,565
I'm not Harry.

97
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,112
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

98
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,490
Got something for you.

99
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:13,287
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,210
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:25,800
Thank you.

102
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,179
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:49,490
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:54,620
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,582
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

106
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:04,088
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,714
Learned what?

108
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:08,467
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:11,720
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

110
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,974
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:18,102
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,313
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:26,735
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,824
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:36,704
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:56,223
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:59,685
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

118
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:04,857
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:09,278
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:12,573
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:16,494
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:22,666
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,046
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,925
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:32,885
A freak!

126
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,055
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:41,977
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:47,191
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,403
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:55,950
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:56,158 --> 00:17:00,079
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,748
He'll not be going.

133
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:06,293
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,503
Muggle?

135
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:11,841
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:15,928
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:22,059
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:27,064
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:31,819
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,071
...in front of me.

141
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:57,178
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,557
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

143
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,853
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:15,237
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,838
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,966
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:41,972
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

148
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:44,809
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:47,394
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,129
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:17,216
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,511
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

153
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,306
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:32,064
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:36,610
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:42,324
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,077
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:50,291
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,918
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:56,255
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:56,464 --> 00:20:01,093
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:06,182
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,142
Goodbye.

164
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:14,440
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

165
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:18,110
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,114
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:42,885
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,737
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:05,908
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:33,018
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:37,106
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,651
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:48,951
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,538
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:58,252
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,894
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:20,357
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:22,526
Best stay close.

179
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:30,242
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:37,625
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:41,796
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:47,468
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:50,554
And there's something else as well.

184
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:55,142
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:04,276
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,530
Very well.

187
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:15,579
Vault 687.

188
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:19,792
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,635
Key, please.

190
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:56,829
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:01,834
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:06,213
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:08,007
Stand back.

194
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:39,079
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:51,425
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:55,054
You want OIlivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:55,763 --> 00:25:00,893
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

198
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,704
Hello?

199
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,501
Hello?

200
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:33,300
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,310
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:49,400
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:58,367
Here we are.

204
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,503
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:18,512
Apparently not.

206
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:28,147
Perhaps...

207
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,984
...this.

208
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:43,662
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,505
I wonder...

210
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,994
Curious.

211
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:27,123
Very curious.

212
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,459
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:35,464
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:38,426
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:43,347
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:46,851
Just one other.

217
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:51,397
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:57,319
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:02,366
And who owned that wand?

220
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,619
We do not speak his name.

221
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:09,582
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,793
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,672
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:20,801
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,264
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:28,184
...did great things.

227
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:30,394
Terrible...

228
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:34,106
...yes, but great.

229
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,781
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,533
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:55,169
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:55,544 --> 00:29:01,133
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:04,970
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:13,395
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:16,148
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:18,859
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:24,073
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

238
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:27,910
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,995
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:34,458
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

241
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,673
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:46,095
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

243
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,682
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

244
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:54,186
<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

245
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:58,357
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

246
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:02,361
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

247
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,326
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

248
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,912
<i>Except you.</i>

249
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:18,043
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:22,673
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:28,721
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:32,558
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:37,062
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,690
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:43,152
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,322
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:51,952
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:56,457
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:56,916 --> 00:31:00,586
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,640
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,393
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:20,606
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

263
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:25,694
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:31,242
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,372
"Platform 93/4"?

266
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,377
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

267
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:44,922
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:05,025
Sorry.

269
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:09,280
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:11,031
On your left.

271
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:15,077
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

272
00:32:15,286 --> 00:32:17,830
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:21,375
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:25,212
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

275
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:34,054
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:44,023 --> 00:32:45,232
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,153
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,322
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,870
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:06,253
Excuse me.

281
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:10,132
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:13,886
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,555
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:22,686
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:26,357
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

286
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:28,210
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,629
Not at all.

288
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:36,135
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:39,013
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,433
So it's true!

291
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:45,436
I mean, do you really have the...?

292
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,898
- The what?
- The scar?

293
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:54,278
Wicked!

294
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:01,911
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:08,250
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:23,766
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,561
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,607
...spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:35,986
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:45,996
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:51,669
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,464
Watch it!

303
00:35:57,466 --> 00:36:01,262
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,060
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

305
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,355
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:15,025
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:18,779
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:20,156
A little.

309
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:23,701
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:25,953
Yeah.

311
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,336
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:37,381
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

313
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:42,303
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:47,683
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

315
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,020
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

316
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:59,403
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:02,865
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:05,701
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,373
For example:

320
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:14,543
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

321
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:19,256
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:24,345
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:28,140
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:32,061
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

325
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:37,358
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:44,949
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:47,118
Just there.

328
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:03,259
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:08,681
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:18,649
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:24,071
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:11,577
Wicked.

333
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,982
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:46,195
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:51,450
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,787
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:59,458
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:04,922
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:09,051
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,389
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:18,894
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:20,438
Trevor!

343
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,990
Sorry.

344
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:35,119
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:39,832
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:42,877
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:44,503
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,798
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:50,301
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:52,970
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,517
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:04,523
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:09,487
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:13,491
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:15,868
I can help you there.

356
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:21,916
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:27,546 --> 00:41:29,757
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,863
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:53,197 --> 00:41:56,075
I read about it
in <i>Hogwarts, A History.</i>

360
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:12,174
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:16,387
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:19,849
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:20,057 --> 00:42:24,854
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:27,356
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:33,654
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:33,904 --> 00:42:39,410
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:39,618 --> 00:42:44,248
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,753
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:52,089
Thank you.

370
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:57,928
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:01,766
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:05,186
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:43:05,394 --> 00:43:08,022
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:10,274 --> 00:43:12,902
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:16,655
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:25,998
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:29,794
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:41,388
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:48,145
Slytherin!

380
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:52,024
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:54,777
Susan Bones.

382
00:44:03,327 --> 00:44:05,454
Harry, what is it?

383
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:08,415
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,084
Let's see...

385
00:44:10,334 --> 00:44:14,672
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:16,424 --> 00:44:18,843
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,695
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:40,698
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:46,912 --> 00:44:49,415
Harry Potter.

390
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:10,478
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:14,648
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:17,151
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,197
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:23,574
But where to put you?

395
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:26,660
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,539
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:35,628
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:41,175
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:46,138
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:48,099
Better be...

401
00:45:48,307 --> 00:45:50,267
...Gryffindor!

402
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:18,587
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:23,342
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:40,276 --> 00:46:41,819
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:45,281
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:48,993
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:49,994 --> 00:46:53,789
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:57,251
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,378
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

410
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:05,176
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,016
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:15,644
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:28,240
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:35,664
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:41,295
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,259
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:50,221
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:53,933
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,227
Like this.

420
00:48:06,237 --> 00:48:10,074
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:14,620
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:18,207
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:22,586
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,518
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:40,396
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:44,108
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,195
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

428
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:50,948
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:49:06,964 --> 00:49:08,549
Password?

430
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:11,802
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,439
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,569
Gather around here.

433
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:33,574
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:33,783 --> 00:49:38,204
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:41,540
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:51,360
Made it!

437
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:55,990
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:59,243 --> 00:51:04,206
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:08,711
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:12,131
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

441
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:18,095
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:31,942
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:35,780
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,742
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,037
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:43,954 --> 00:51:47,291
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:54,256
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:57,384
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:57,593 --> 00:52:00,137
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:06,268
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:15,194
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

452
00:52:15,402 --> 00:52:21,367
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:24,537
...to not pay attention.

454
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:33,087
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:34,296 --> 00:52:38,134
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:46,100
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:51,772
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:56,610
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:59,280
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:03,409
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:08,205
I don't know, sir.

462
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,541
Pity.

463
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:16,505
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:20,050
...is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:27,850
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

466
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:30,603
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

467
00:53:30,936 --> 00:53:33,606
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:38,569
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

469
00:53:45,284 --> 00:53:47,203
Mail's here.

470
00:54:19,485 --> 00:54:22,446
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,577
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:34,291
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:38,003
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:41,715
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:45,594
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:51,559
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:57,481
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

478
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,944
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:14,623
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:14,832 --> 00:55:17,626
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:21,380
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:25,509
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:31,307
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

484
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:33,476
Up!

485
00:55:33,726 --> 00:55:34,685
Up.

486
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:38,022
Up.

487
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,317
Up. Up!

488
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:43,527
With feeling.

489
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:54,330
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,210
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:59,418 --> 00:56:03,422
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:08,761
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:12,807
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:17,311
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:20,689
On my whistle. Three, two...

496
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:24,485
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:31,992
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

498
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,452
Neville!

499
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:39,834
Come back down this instant!

500
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:11,198
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:16,746 --> 00:57:18,914
Is he all right?

502
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:24,962
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:26,255 --> 00:57:30,926
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,805
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:35,014 --> 00:57:40,227
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:40,478 --> 00:57:42,396
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:46,442
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,153
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:53,699
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,331
How about on the roof?

511
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:05,336
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,675
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:11,884 --> 00:58:14,804
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:17,014
What an idiot.

515
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:23,896
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,232
Is that so?

517
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,654
Have it your way, then.

518
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:08,023
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:10,276
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:11,235 --> 00:59:13,237
Follow me.

521
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:27,168
You wait here.

522
00:59:28,919 --> 00:59:34,216
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:36,260
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:41,932 --> 00:59:47,688
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:53,277
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:53,527 --> 00:59:55,738
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:56,197 --> 01:00:00,242
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:04,955
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

529
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:07,792
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,503
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:14,423
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:17,301
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:21,472
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,433
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:24,683 --> 01:00:30,314
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:33,734
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:34,151 --> 01:00:38,948
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:47,498 --> 01:00:51,335
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:54,380
I didn't know.

540
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:03,472
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:05,975
Who doesn't?

542
01:01:06,892 --> 01:01:09,019
What's happening?

543
01:01:09,228 --> 01:01:13,441
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:23,367
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,420
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,797
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:37,006 --> 01:01:40,926
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:42,094 --> 01:01:43,679
Let's go.

549
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,768
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

550
01:01:52,563 --> 01:01:55,900
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,073
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

552
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:05,451
Move over!

553
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,537
<i>Alohomora.</i>

554
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:11,332
Get in.

555
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:13,667
<i>Alohomora?</i>

556
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:16,420
<i>Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.</i>

557
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:20,007
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:26,263 --> 01:02:27,264
Come on.

559
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,601
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:34,480
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

561
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:05,636
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:09,515
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:03:09,723 --> 01:03:13,894
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:16,981
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:20,860
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:24,613
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

567
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:28,784
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:28,993 --> 01:03:32,621
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:35,958
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:39,211 --> 01:03:43,466
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:52,308
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:52,516 --> 01:03:58,230
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:07,448
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:13,621
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:18,209
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:22,880
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:27,343
You better take this.

578
01:04:37,394 --> 01:04:40,189
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:50,408
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:09,343
What was that?

581
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:13,848
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:14,056 --> 01:05:17,560
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:21,147 --> 01:05:25,734
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:25,985 --> 01:05:28,487
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:31,699
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

586
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:35,911
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,080
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:41,542
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:44,253
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:48,382
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:57,475 --> 01:06:02,813
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:06:03,022 --> 01:06:06,984
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:09,612
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:14,992
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:15,201 --> 01:06:18,537
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,710
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:29,715
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>
Off you go, then.

598
01:06:30,758 --> 01:06:33,260
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

599
01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:35,846
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

600
01:06:39,683 --> 01:06:43,938
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:44,188 --> 01:06:50,152
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's <i>Leviosa,</i> not Leviosar.

602
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:54,949
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,286
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

604
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:12,425
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:14,301
Splendid!

606
01:07:15,886 --> 01:07:18,097
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:26,397
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:37,158
<i>"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."</i>

609
01:07:37,408 --> 01:07:42,747
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:43,414 --> 01:07:45,958
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,697
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:20,034
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:20,242 --> 01:08:24,330
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:32,421
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:36,008
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:38,803 --> 01:08:41,138
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,856
Silence!

618
01:08:52,441 --> 01:08:56,487
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:57,154 --> 01:08:58,739
Now...

620
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:03,494
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:09:04,203 --> 01:09:08,999
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:20,052 --> 01:09:23,222
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:25,182
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:30,563
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:34,775
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:46,871 --> 01:09:50,124
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:56,172
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:29,580
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:37,088
Help! Help!

630
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:41,175
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:55,481
Help!

632
01:11:16,627 --> 01:11:19,004
Do something!

633
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:24,343
- What?
- Anything!

634
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,430
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

635
01:11:27,638 --> 01:11:29,974
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

636
01:11:40,901 --> 01:11:42,903
Cool.

637
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:10,139
Is it dead?

638
01:12:10,347 --> 01:12:14,268
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:20,524 --> 01:12:22,860
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:25,362 --> 01:12:28,908
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:33,746
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:37,124
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,089
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:45,174
But I was wrong.

645
01:12:45,382 --> 01:12:50,429
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:55,851
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:01,732
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:13:01,941 --> 01:13:04,944
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:08,739
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:11,200
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:14,829
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:18,457
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:21,293
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:23,963
Five points...

655
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:28,467
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:33,139
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:42,481
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:53,075
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:53,284 --> 01:13:56,495
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:56,704 --> 01:13:58,914
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:59,498 --> 01:14:05,129
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:14:05,337 --> 01:14:08,507
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:14:08,716 --> 01:14:11,844
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:14:19,518 --> 01:14:22,938
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

665
01:14:23,355 --> 01:14:27,485
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:14:27,693 --> 01:14:30,362
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:14:30,571 --> 01:14:33,324
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

668
01:14:33,574 --> 01:14:35,785
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:14:36,452 --> 01:14:39,705
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:43,167
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:44,502
You're saying...

672
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:49,215
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:15:02,353 --> 01:15:06,315
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

674
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:08,400
Let's open it.

675
01:15:18,577 --> 01:15:19,829
It's a broomstick.

676
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:24,750
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:28,254
But who...?

678
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,403
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

679
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:56,282
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:59,994
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

681
01:16:00,286 --> 01:16:02,955
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:16:03,164 --> 01:16:06,000
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:31,567
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

684
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:36,489
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:09,230
The players take their positions...

686
01:17:09,438 --> 01:17:13,234
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:16,779
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

688
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:19,824
...from all of you!

689
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:27,873
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,793
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:34,797
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:45,057
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:08,539
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:15,004
Well done!

695
01:18:19,383 --> 01:18:25,097
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:59,924
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:15,606
Give me that!

698
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:49,682
Take that side!

699
01:20:39,148 --> 01:20:42,401
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:53,537
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:20:53,746 --> 01:20:58,125
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

702
01:21:19,897 --> 01:21:21,440
Come on, Hermione!

703
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:39,291
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

704
01:21:46,382 --> 01:21:49,427
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:22:07,278 --> 01:22:09,447
Go, go, go, go!

706
01:23:01,457 --> 01:23:03,793
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

707
01:23:04,877 --> 01:23:06,337
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:23:06,545 --> 01:23:10,633
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:12,510
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:23:56,095 --> 01:24:00,349
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:04,478
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:07,106
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

713
01:24:07,314 --> 01:24:10,985
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:24:11,193 --> 01:24:16,490
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

715
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:21,287
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:25,875
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:29,545
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:35,134
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:24:35,342 --> 01:24:38,929
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:24:39,138 --> 01:24:41,390
Exactly.

721
01:24:42,057 --> 01:24:44,810
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

722
01:24:45,019 --> 01:24:49,690
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

723
01:24:49,899 --> 01:24:54,987
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:56,614
Nicholas Flamel?

725
01:24:57,615 --> 01:25:02,328
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:25:02,536 --> 01:25:06,624
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:25:06,832 --> 01:25:08,834
I don't know.

728
01:25:27,686 --> 01:25:30,523
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

729
01:25:30,773 --> 01:25:33,567
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

730
01:25:33,776 --> 01:25:36,570
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

731
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:39,698
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

732
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:56,632
Knight to e5.

733
01:26:04,306 --> 01:26:06,475
Queen to e5.

734
01:26:12,106 --> 01:26:13,524
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:17,695
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

736
01:26:17,903 --> 01:26:19,363
I see you haven't.

737
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:24,869
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:26:25,077 --> 01:26:28,914
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:26:29,123 --> 01:26:32,501
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:36,213
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:26:36,839 --> 01:26:42,094
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:47,224
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:54,106
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

744
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:07,286
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

745
01:27:07,495 --> 01:27:09,705
What are you wearing?

746
01:27:10,289 --> 01:27:14,001
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:27:15,127 --> 01:27:17,546
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

748
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:27,056
There they are.

749
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:41,570
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:45,950
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

751
01:28:02,758 --> 01:28:06,470
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

752
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:09,682
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

753
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,397
My body's gone!

754
01:28:16,605 --> 01:28:20,192
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:28:20,735 --> 01:28:22,653
I'm invisible?

756
01:28:23,112 --> 01:28:27,533
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:28:27,992 --> 01:28:32,788
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

758
01:29:00,858 --> 01:29:06,739
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

759
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:12,787
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:29:31,597 --> 01:29:33,516
Who's there?

761
01:29:39,647 --> 01:29:45,277
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,414
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:30:43,586 --> 01:30:44,962
Severus, I...

764
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:49,508
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

765
01:30:49,717 --> 01:30:54,430
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:31:11,655 --> 01:31:14,867
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:31:15,076 --> 01:31:20,539
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:25,211
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:31:25,753 --> 01:31:30,800
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:33:02,892 --> 01:33:04,727
Mum?

771
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,982
Dad?

772
01:33:44,725 --> 01:33:49,688
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

773
01:33:51,524 --> 01:33:54,402
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

774
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:58,197
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

775
01:34:04,912 --> 01:34:09,208
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

776
01:34:10,668 --> 01:34:12,628
I only see us.

777
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:16,215
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

778
01:34:16,424 --> 01:34:22,346
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

779
01:34:22,847 --> 01:34:25,182
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

780
01:34:25,433 --> 01:34:29,603
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

781
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:33,190
I look good.

782
01:34:33,816 --> 01:34:37,653
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:34:37,862 --> 01:34:42,825
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:35:05,973 --> 01:35:08,142
Back again, Harry?

785
01:35:11,228 --> 01:35:13,731
I see that you,
like many before you...

786
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:18,110
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:35:18,444 --> 01:35:22,615
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:35:23,908 --> 01:35:26,452
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:35:26,994 --> 01:35:29,121
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:32,708
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:35,252
...exactly as he is.

792
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:40,508
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:35:40,716 --> 01:35:43,469
Yes. And no.

794
01:35:44,512 --> 01:35:46,972
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:35:47,181 --> 01:35:53,145
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:35:53,354 --> 01:35:58,067
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

797
01:35:58,275 --> 01:36:02,154
...you see them standing beside you.

798
01:36:02,363 --> 01:36:04,782
But remember this, Harry.

799
01:36:05,032 --> 01:36:10,913
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:36:11,122 --> 01:36:13,249
...or truth.

801
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:20,256
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:36:21,298 --> 01:36:25,428
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:36:25,636 --> 01:36:27,555
And I must ask you...

804
01:36:28,514 --> 01:36:32,393
...not to go looking for it again.

805
01:36:33,144 --> 01:36:36,272
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:36:36,856 --> 01:36:39,734
...and forget to live.

807
01:37:34,455 --> 01:37:40,127
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:37:40,377 --> 01:37:43,464
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:37:43,672 --> 01:37:45,674
This is light?

810
01:37:50,262 --> 01:37:52,681
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:56,894
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

812
01:37:57,144 --> 01:37:58,312
The what?

813
01:37:58,979 --> 01:38:01,982
Honestly, don't you two read?

814
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:06,695
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

815
01:38:06,904 --> 01:38:09,532
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:13,744
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

817
01:38:13,953 --> 01:38:16,122
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

818
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:18,416
I know what it means!

819
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:24,004
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:38:24,213 --> 01:38:29,385
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

821
01:38:31,095 --> 01:38:33,264
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:38:33,472 --> 01:38:38,185
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

823
01:38:54,952 --> 01:38:58,748
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:38:58,956 --> 01:39:01,667
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

825
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:11,510
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

826
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:14,513
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:39:14,889 --> 01:39:19,060
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:20,394
What?

829
01:39:20,561 --> 01:39:23,981
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:26,859
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

831
01:39:27,068 --> 01:39:30,946
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

832
01:39:31,155 --> 01:39:33,783
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

833
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:37,078
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

834
01:39:37,286 --> 01:39:39,371
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:43,250
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:47,088
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:40:00,935 --> 01:40:06,023
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

838
01:40:06,273 --> 01:40:08,275
I know what that is!

839
01:40:08,484 --> 01:40:11,112
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

840
01:40:11,487 --> 01:40:14,740
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:40:14,949 --> 01:40:19,036
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

842
01:40:41,267 --> 01:40:43,477
Is that...

843
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,438
...a dragon?

844
01:40:45,646 --> 01:40:50,067
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:40:50,276 --> 01:40:53,154
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:40:53,362 --> 01:40:58,242
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

847
01:40:58,909 --> 01:41:00,661
Hello, Norbert.

848
01:41:00,995 --> 01:41:05,291
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

849
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:08,502
Don't you, Norbert?

850
01:41:15,468 --> 01:41:18,596
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

851
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:24,560
Who's that?

852
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:28,355
Malfoy.

853
01:41:29,106 --> 01:41:30,524
Oh, dear.

854
01:41:32,234 --> 01:41:37,031
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

855
01:41:37,239 --> 01:41:41,285
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

856
01:41:41,494 --> 01:41:45,581
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

857
01:41:45,873 --> 01:41:48,042
Good evening.

858
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:54,590
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

859
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,344
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:41:58,552 --> 01:42:03,432
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

861
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:05,976
- 50?!
- Each.

862
01:42:07,019 --> 01:42:09,397
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:42:09,605 --> 01:42:12,942
...all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:16,821
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:42:17,029 --> 01:42:19,365
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:42:19,573 --> 01:42:22,076
No, you heard me correctly.

867
01:42:22,284 --> 01:42:27,289
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:42:27,748 --> 01:42:30,709
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:42:41,929 --> 01:42:45,933
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:42:46,142 --> 01:42:50,855
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:42:51,063 --> 01:42:53,899
God, I miss the screaming.

872
01:42:56,444 --> 01:42:59,739
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:42:59,947 --> 01:43:05,286
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:43:07,371 --> 01:43:10,332
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

875
01:43:11,792 --> 01:43:16,797
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

876
01:43:19,049 --> 01:43:21,135
Norbert's gone.

877
01:43:21,677 --> 01:43:25,222
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:43:25,514 --> 01:43:28,768
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:43:28,934 --> 01:43:31,270
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:35,733
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:43:36,358 --> 01:43:41,614
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:43:41,822 --> 01:43:44,200
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:43:44,408 --> 01:43:50,081
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:43:50,539 --> 01:43:54,376
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,171
...werewolves.

886
01:43:57,588 --> 01:44:00,883
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:44:01,092 --> 01:44:03,761
You can be sure of that.

888
01:44:05,721 --> 01:44:07,139
Nighty-night.

889
01:44:09,725 --> 01:44:12,561
Right. Let's go.

890
01:44:50,766 --> 01:44:53,185
Hagrid, what is that?

891
01:44:53,394 --> 01:44:56,772
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:44:57,273 --> 01:45:02,653
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:45:03,195 --> 01:45:07,783
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:21,046
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:45:21,255 --> 01:45:24,383
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

896
01:45:24,842 --> 01:45:28,137
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:45:29,388 --> 01:45:31,682
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:45:31,849 --> 01:45:37,605
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:45:41,275 --> 01:45:46,280
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:45:46,489 --> 01:45:50,409
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:45:50,618 --> 01:45:53,204
I'm not scared, Potter.

902
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:56,290
Do you hear that?

903
01:45:58,834 --> 01:46:00,252
Come on, Fang.

904
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:01,962
Scared!

905
01:46:26,946 --> 01:46:29,115
What is it, Fang?

906
01:47:39,477 --> 01:47:44,982
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:47:45,191 --> 01:47:49,195
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:47:49,403 --> 01:47:52,156
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:47:52,364 --> 01:47:57,703
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:47:57,912 --> 01:48:03,459
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:08,756
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:48:08,964 --> 01:48:13,803
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

913
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:15,805
A cursed life.

914
01:48:16,013 --> 01:48:19,975
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

915
01:48:20,184 --> 01:48:25,147
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:48:25,481 --> 01:48:29,402
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

917
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:34,782
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:48:35,616 --> 01:48:37,159
The Philosopher's Stone.

919
01:48:38,494 --> 01:48:40,496
Harry!

920
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:45,584
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:48:45,793 --> 01:48:47,962
You all right there, Harry?

922
01:48:49,088 --> 01:48:53,384
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

923
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:58,097
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:09,859
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:49:10,067 --> 01:49:12,862
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:15,990
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:49:16,198 --> 01:49:20,578
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:49:20,786 --> 01:49:25,332
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:49:25,541 --> 01:49:27,126
He'll come back.

930
01:49:27,334 --> 01:49:29,086
But if he comes back...

931
01:49:29,336 --> 01:49:33,299
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

932
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:37,845
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:49:38,053 --> 01:49:41,640
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:49:41,849 --> 01:49:45,436
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:50,691
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:49:51,442 --> 01:49:56,572
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

937
01:49:56,781 --> 01:50:00,826
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

938
01:50:06,582 --> 01:50:12,004
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:50:12,213 --> 01:50:15,883
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

940
01:50:16,092 --> 01:50:21,263
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

941
01:50:21,472 --> 01:50:24,141
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

942
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:27,853
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:50:35,486 --> 01:50:37,947
- Of course!
- What is it?

944
01:50:38,155 --> 01:50:41,909
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:50:42,118 --> 01:50:45,204
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:50:45,413 --> 01:50:48,082
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:50,543
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:50:56,132 --> 01:50:59,635
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:50:59,844 --> 01:51:02,596
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:51:02,805 --> 01:51:05,391
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:51:05,975 --> 01:51:09,520
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:13,733
I said, " After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

953
01:51:13,941 --> 01:51:18,404
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

954
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:22,992
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:28,831
But I told him, " The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

956
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:34,503
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:38,841
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:51:39,091 --> 01:51:41,302
Where are you going?

959
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:51,062
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,148
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:51:54,356 --> 01:51:58,652
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:01,614
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:52:01,864 --> 01:52:04,075
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

964
01:52:05,993 --> 01:52:09,705
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:52:10,331 --> 01:52:15,544
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:52:15,753 --> 01:52:20,049
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

967
01:52:28,349 --> 01:52:31,143
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:52:31,352 --> 01:52:34,021
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:38,109
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

970
01:52:40,152 --> 01:52:43,239
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:52:43,489 --> 01:52:47,785
...be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:56,085
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

973
01:52:56,627 --> 01:52:58,587
People will think you're...

974
01:53:02,883 --> 01:53:05,594
...up to something.

975
01:53:15,896 --> 01:53:17,898
Now what do we do?

976
01:53:18,107 --> 01:53:21,861
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:53:35,624 --> 01:53:37,084
Trevor.

978
01:53:37,418 --> 01:53:40,838
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:53:41,088 --> 01:53:46,510
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

980
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:50,681
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

981
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:55,519
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

982
01:53:55,728 --> 01:54:00,024
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

983
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:11,786
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

984
01:54:12,036 --> 01:54:15,664
Brilliant, but scary.

985
01:54:16,332 --> 01:54:18,375
Let's go.

986
01:54:18,584 --> 01:54:22,838
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

987
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:32,223
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

988
01:54:36,102 --> 01:54:38,145
<i>Alohomora.</i>

989
01:54:50,157 --> 01:54:52,743
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:54:53,953 --> 01:54:56,122
...snoring.

991
01:54:58,624 --> 01:55:04,171
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:55:05,756 --> 01:55:08,759
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:55:11,345 --> 01:55:13,431
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

994
01:55:13,639 --> 01:55:15,057
Come on!

995
01:55:19,103 --> 01:55:21,188
Okay. Push.

996
01:55:44,336 --> 01:55:47,965
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

997
01:55:48,174 --> 01:55:53,179
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

998
01:55:53,971 --> 01:55:57,433
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:55:58,142 --> 01:55:59,977
The harp.

1000
01:56:00,644 --> 01:56:03,355
It's stopped playing.

1001
01:56:13,407 --> 01:56:14,533
Jump!

1002
01:56:28,714 --> 01:56:32,343
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1003
01:56:46,774 --> 01:56:49,860
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:53,781
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:56:53,989 --> 01:56:58,994
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1006
01:57:01,247 --> 01:57:02,581
Hermione!

1007
01:57:03,165 --> 01:57:06,961
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1008
01:57:07,169 --> 01:57:11,674
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:57:18,764 --> 01:57:22,101
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:57:22,309 --> 01:57:25,354
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1011
01:57:25,563 --> 01:57:28,107
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1012
01:57:28,315 --> 01:57:31,235
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:35,948
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1014
01:57:36,157 --> 01:57:40,536
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:57:40,786 --> 01:57:42,830
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

1016
01:57:50,921 --> 01:57:53,507
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1017
01:57:56,218 --> 01:57:58,679
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:57:59,430 --> 01:58:02,933
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,062
What is that?

1020
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:09,982
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:26,582
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:58:26,791 --> 01:58:30,419
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:58:30,628 --> 01:58:34,090
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:42,181
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1025
01:58:48,062 --> 01:58:50,106
Strange.

1026
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:52,817
<i>Alohomora!</i>

1027
01:58:55,778 --> 01:58:58,030
Well, it was worth a try.

1028
01:58:58,239 --> 01:59:01,492
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:05,621
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:09,250
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:59:12,837 --> 01:59:15,172
What's wrong?

1032
01:59:16,048 --> 01:59:17,550
It's too simple.

1033
01:59:17,758 --> 01:59:22,513
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1034
01:59:22,722 --> 01:59:26,267
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:59:43,117 --> 01:59:46,120
This complicates things a bit.

1036
02:00:07,391 --> 02:00:09,310
Catch the key!

1037
02:00:13,731 --> 02:00:15,649
Hurry up!

1038
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:52,812
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:56,190
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
02:00:56,565 --> 02:00:59,193
This is no graveyard.

1041
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,620
It's a chessboard.

1042
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:23,509
There's the door.

1043
02:01:35,563 --> 02:01:37,064
Now what do we do?

1044
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:41,569
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
02:01:42,153 --> 02:01:45,906
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:50,453
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
02:01:50,703 --> 02:01:54,749
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1048
02:02:01,922 --> 02:02:03,632
What happens now?

1049
02:02:04,425 --> 02:02:07,428
Well, white moves first.

1050
02:02:07,636 --> 02:02:09,513
And then...

1051
02:02:11,265 --> 02:02:12,516
...we play.

1052
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:28,157
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
02:02:28,407 --> 02:02:31,952
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1054
02:02:32,328 --> 02:02:35,289
You there, d5.

1055
02:02:49,887 --> 02:02:51,472
Yes, Hermione.

1056
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:56,769
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1057
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:05,194
Castle to e4!

1058
02:03:08,823 --> 02:03:11,117
Pawn to c3!

1059
02:03:55,745 --> 02:03:59,749
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1060
02:03:59,999 --> 02:04:04,712
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1061
02:04:05,337 --> 02:04:07,673
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
02:04:07,882 --> 02:04:10,593
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1063
02:04:11,218 --> 02:04:15,890
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1064
02:04:16,098 --> 02:04:19,852
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
02:04:20,061 --> 02:04:23,647
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
02:04:24,148 --> 02:04:26,901
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
02:04:37,161 --> 02:04:40,081
Knight to h3.

1068
02:05:01,018 --> 02:05:03,020
Check.

1069
02:05:32,174 --> 02:05:33,968
Ron!

1070
02:05:34,176 --> 02:05:39,974
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1071
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:56,323
Checkmate.

1072
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,763
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:06:18,971 --> 02:06:22,850
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:06:23,059 --> 02:06:24,935
I have to go on.

1075
02:06:25,436 --> 02:06:31,358
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:06:31,567 --> 02:06:34,070
Not as good as you.

1077
02:06:34,904 --> 02:06:39,742
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:06:40,951 --> 02:06:46,582
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1079
02:07:24,662 --> 02:07:26,330
You?

1080
02:07:27,123 --> 02:07:30,960
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1081
02:07:31,168 --> 02:07:34,213
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1082
02:07:34,422 --> 02:07:37,550
Next to him, who would suspect...

1083
02:07:37,758 --> 02:07:41,679
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1084
02:07:41,887 --> 02:07:47,268
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:07:47,476 --> 02:07:50,271
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:54,942
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:57,361
...I would have succeeded.

1088
02:07:57,570 --> 02:08:00,573
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:08:00,781 --> 02:08:02,992
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:08,539
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:08:08,748 --> 02:08:13,002
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1092
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:16,213
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1093
02:08:16,797 --> 02:08:21,761
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:08:22,678 --> 02:08:26,182
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1095
02:08:27,183 --> 02:08:32,438
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1096
02:08:32,646 --> 02:08:36,692
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:08:36,901 --> 02:08:40,988
Now, what does this mirror do?

1098
02:08:42,573 --> 02:08:44,700
I see what I desire.

1099
02:08:45,242 --> 02:08:49,663
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1100
02:08:49,872 --> 02:08:52,041
Use the boy.

1101
02:08:52,833 --> 02:08:56,754
Come here, Potter! Now!

1102
02:09:08,849 --> 02:09:12,853
Tell me, what do you see?

1103
02:09:38,003 --> 02:09:40,423
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:09:40,631 --> 02:09:45,803
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:09:46,011 --> 02:09:47,555
He lies.

1106
02:09:48,055 --> 02:09:51,767
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:09:51,976 --> 02:09:56,355
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1108
02:09:56,605 --> 02:10:00,609
I have strength enough for this.

1109
02:10:18,794 --> 02:10:21,672
Harry Potter...

1110
02:10:21,881 --> 02:10:24,216
...we meet again.

1111
02:10:24,425 --> 02:10:25,843
Voldemort.

1112
02:10:26,052 --> 02:10:30,014
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:10:30,264 --> 02:10:33,851
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:38,189
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:10:38,856 --> 02:10:42,193
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:10:42,401 --> 02:10:46,072
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:49,825
But there is something that can.

1118
02:10:50,034 --> 02:10:55,706
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:10:56,082 --> 02:10:57,625
Stop him!

1120
02:11:02,671 --> 02:11:05,424
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:11:05,925 --> 02:11:09,053
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:11:09,261 --> 02:11:12,890
...when you can join me and live?

1123
02:11:13,099 --> 02:11:14,183
Never!

1124
02:11:16,185 --> 02:11:20,981
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:11:21,732 --> 02:11:25,027
Tell me, Harry...

1126
02:11:25,277 --> 02:11:29,156
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:11:29,407 --> 02:11:31,492
Together...

1128
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:34,245
...we can bring them back.

1129
02:11:34,662 --> 02:11:39,375
All I ask is for something in return.

1130
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:49,218
That's it, Harry.

1131
02:11:50,094 --> 02:11:53,973
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:11:54,181 --> 02:11:57,184
There is only power...

1133
02:11:57,393 --> 02:12:01,522
...and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:12:02,189 --> 02:12:07,236
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:12:07,653 --> 02:12:09,905
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:12:12,533 --> 02:12:13,701
You liar!

1137
02:12:13,909 --> 02:12:16,036
Kill him!

1138
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:44,899
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1139
02:14:30,171 --> 02:14:32,673
Good afternoon, Harry.

1140
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:39,305
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1141
02:14:39,513 --> 02:14:45,519
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1142
02:14:45,728 --> 02:14:50,524
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1143
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:56,489
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:14:56,697 --> 02:14:59,533
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:14:59,742 --> 02:15:02,745
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:15:02,953 --> 02:15:07,833
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:15:08,417 --> 02:15:11,212
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1148
02:15:11,545 --> 02:15:14,382
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:15:14,632 --> 02:15:18,844
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1150
02:15:19,053 --> 02:15:23,015
...and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:15:23,224 --> 02:15:27,061
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1152
02:15:29,105 --> 02:15:34,610
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:15:34,819 --> 02:15:38,030
But yes, he will die.

1154
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:40,699
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1155
02:15:40,908 --> 02:15:43,452
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

1156
02:15:43,661 --> 02:15:47,748
You see, only a person...

1157
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:51,961
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1158
02:15:52,211 --> 02:15:56,757
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1159
02:15:57,717 --> 02:16:01,220
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:16:01,429 --> 02:16:06,475
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1161
02:16:07,935 --> 02:16:13,149
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:16:13,357 --> 02:16:15,693
I'm afraid...

1163
02:16:17,111 --> 02:16:21,157
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:16:21,866 --> 02:16:24,452
Harry, do you know why...

1165
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:28,664
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:16:28,873 --> 02:16:33,502
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:16:34,045 --> 02:16:37,256
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:16:37,465 --> 02:16:41,260
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:16:41,469 --> 02:16:46,390
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1170
02:16:47,224 --> 02:16:50,978
Love, Harry. Love.

1171
02:16:59,028 --> 02:17:03,157
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:17:03,365 --> 02:17:08,037
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:17:08,287 --> 02:17:11,582
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:17:11,791 --> 02:17:15,169
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:17:15,378 --> 02:17:17,755
...with a nice toffee.

1176
02:17:21,842 --> 02:17:23,386
Alas!

1177
02:17:24,095 --> 02:17:26,222
Earwax.

1178
02:17:41,445 --> 02:17:44,615
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1179
02:17:45,741 --> 02:17:48,452
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:50,955
Never better.

1181
02:18:06,762 --> 02:18:09,223
Another year gone.

1182
02:18:09,974 --> 02:18:14,520
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1183
02:18:14,729 --> 02:18:17,356
And the points stand thus:

1184
02:18:17,565 --> 02:18:23,362
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1185
02:18:25,322 --> 02:18:30,995
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1186
02:18:36,292 --> 02:18:38,085
In second place...

1187
02:18:38,294 --> 02:18:43,090
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1188
02:18:48,763 --> 02:18:50,473
And in first place...

1189
02:18:50,806 --> 02:18:56,228
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1190
02:19:01,817 --> 02:19:04,028
Nice one, mate.

1191
02:19:07,865 --> 02:19:11,952
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1192
02:19:12,203 --> 02:19:16,499
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1193
02:19:16,707 --> 02:19:21,670
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1194
02:19:22,296 --> 02:19:27,802
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1195
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,805
...while others were in grave peril...

1196
02:19:31,514 --> 02:19:33,766
...50 points.

1197
02:19:34,683 --> 02:19:35,976
Good job.

1198
02:19:42,588 --> 02:19:48,636
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1199
02:19:49,137 --> 02:19:54,392
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1200
02:19:59,022 --> 02:20:01,065
And third...

1201
02:20:01,608 --> 02:20:04,485
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1202
02:20:04,694 --> 02:20:08,990
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1203
02:20:09,574 --> 02:20:14,454
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1204
02:20:22,754 --> 02:20:24,672
We're tied with Slytherin!

1205
02:20:24,881 --> 02:20:30,887
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1206
02:20:31,095 --> 02:20:34,974
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1207
02:20:35,183 --> 02:20:37,544
I award 10 points...

1208
02:20:37,737 --> 02:20:40,948
...to Neville Longbottom.

1209
02:20:54,295 --> 02:20:57,715
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1210
02:20:57,923 --> 02:21:02,470
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1211
02:21:07,516 --> 02:21:10,895
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1212
02:21:48,229 --> 02:21:51,565
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1213
02:21:51,774 --> 02:21:56,070
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1214
02:22:01,492 --> 02:22:04,787
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1215
02:22:11,043 --> 02:22:14,797
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1216
02:22:18,009 --> 02:22:19,844
This is for you.

1217
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:37,738
Thanks, Hagrid.

1218
02:22:43,577 --> 02:22:47,998
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1219
02:22:48,415 --> 02:22:52,878
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1220
02:22:53,128 --> 02:22:55,797
...you could always threaten him...

1221
02:22:56,006 --> 02:22:58,884
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1222
02:22:59,092 --> 02:23:04,181
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1223
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:08,977
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1224
02:23:14,483 --> 02:23:17,611
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1225
02:23:17,819 --> 02:23:19,905
I'm not going home.

1226
02:23:20,113 --> 02:23:22,032
Not really.
