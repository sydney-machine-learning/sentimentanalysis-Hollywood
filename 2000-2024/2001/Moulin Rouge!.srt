There was a boy

00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:41,017
A very strange enchanted boy

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,359
They say he wandered very far

00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,238
Very far

And then one day

13
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,068
A magic day

14
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:37,573
He passed my way

15
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:45,706
And while we spoke of many things

16
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:50,253
Fools and kings

17
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,426
This he said to me

18
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,851
The greatest thing

CHRISTIAN:
The Moulin Rouge.

24
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,256
A nightclub...

25
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,262
...a dance hall and a bordello...

26
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,600
...ruled over by Harold Zidler.

27
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,145
A kingdom of nighttime pleasures...

28
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,773
...where the rich and powerful
played with...

29
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,652
...the young and beautiful creatures
of the underworld.

30
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,949
The most beautiful of all these...

31
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,452
...was the woman who I loved.

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,079
Satine.

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:12,335
A courtesan, she sold her love to men.

34
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,255
They called her
"The Sparkling Diamond."

35
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,466
And she was the star...

36
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,802
...of the Moulin Rouge.

37
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,362
The woman I loved...

...is...

...dead.

40
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,084
I first came to Paris...

41
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,213
...one year ago.

42
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,552
lt was  1 899, the Summer of Love.

43
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,766
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,
Harold Zidler or Satine.

44
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,520
The world had been swept up in
a Bohemian revolution, and l had...

45
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,398
...travelled from London to be a part of it.

46
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,694
On the hill near Paris
was the village of Montmartre.

47
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,696
It was not,
as my father said--

48
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,280
A village of sin.

49
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,742
--but the center of
the Bohemian world.

50

Musicians, painters, writers.

51
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,541
They were known as
the Children of the Revolution.

52
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,503
Yes. I had come to live a penniless
existence. I had come to...

53
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,256
...write about truth, beauty,
freedom...

54
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,718
...and that which l believed in
above all things: love.

55
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,055
Always this ridiculous obsession
with love!

56
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,266
There was only one problem.

57
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,893
I'd never been in love.

58
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,731
Luckily, right at that moment, an unconscious
Argentinean fell through my roof.

60
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,445
He was joined by a dwarf
dressed as a nun.

How do you do?

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,327
My name is Henri Marie Raymond
Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa.

63
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,206
I'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs
rehearsing a play.

64
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,795
A play. Something very modern called
Spectacular Spectacular.

65
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,213
It's set in Switzerland.

66
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,508
Unfortunately, he unconscious Argentinean
suffered from narcolepsy.

...unconscious the next. Ha, ha.
AUDREY: How is he?

70
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,976
Wonderful. The narcoleptic Argentinean
is unconscious.

71
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,147
Therefore the scenario will not be finished
to present to the financier tomorrow.

I still have to finish the music.
We just find someone to read the part.

...of the young, sensitive
Swiss poet goatherder?

Can we just stick
to a little decorative piano?

81
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,265
There seemed to be artistic differences
over Audrey's lyrics to Satie's song.

82
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,518
Don't think a nun would say that
about a hill.

intoning the descant"?

Audrey, you should write the show together.
I beg your pardon?

But Toulouse's suggestion that
Audrey and I write together...

Satine.

116
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,838
They would dress me
in the Argentinian's best suit...

...and pass me off
as a famous English writer.

00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,566
Tell him it's over.

889
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,737
The Duke is expecting you
in the tower at 8.

SATINE [SINGlNG IN VOICE-OVER]:
If I should die

891
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,916
This very moment

892
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:50,753
I wouldn't fear

893
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:56,342
For I've never known completeness

894
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:01,138
Like being here

895
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,934
Wrapped in the warmth of you

896
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:10,856
Loving every breath of you

897
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,277
Why live life

898
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,572
From dream

899
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,242
To dream?

900
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:30,084
And dread the day

901

[WHEEZING]

902
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,716
How could I know...

903
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,803
...in those last fatal days...

904
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,848
[COUGHlNG]

905
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,811
...that a force darker
than jealousy...

906
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,276
...and stronger than love...

907
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,155
...had begun to take hold...

908
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,656
...of Satine?

909
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,832
Where is she?

910
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,927
MARIE: Will she be up and about by tonight?
Tomorrow morning at the earliest.

911
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,019
The Duke's leaving!

912
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,023
She's confessing!

913
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:38,527
Confessing? What kind of imbecile
do you take me for, Zidler?

914
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,947
She suddenly had a terrible desire...

915
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,700
...to go to a priest and...

916
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,995
...confess her sins.
What?

917
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:51,540
She wanted to be cleansed
of her former life.

918
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:55,795
She looks upon tonight
as her wedding night.

919
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:56,962
Her wedding night?

920
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,840
She's like a blushing bride.

921
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,968
She says you make her feel like a...

922
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,638
...virgin.

923
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,307
Virgin?

924
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,643
You know. Touched...

925
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,479
...for the very first time.

926
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:19,402
She says it feels so good inside...

927
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,405
...when you hold her...

928
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,408
...and you touch her.

929
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,577
Like a virgin.

930
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:33,249
She's made it through the wilderness
somehow. She's made it through.

931
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,585
[SINGING]
She didn't know how lost she was

932
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:40,297
Until she found you

933
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:44,260
She was beat
Incomplete

934
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:49,974
She'd been had
She was sad and blue

935
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:53,102
But you made her feel

936
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,981
Yes, you made her feel

Gonna give you all her love

Her fear is fading fast

944
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,215
Been saving it all for you
Only love can last

945
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:27,219
She's so fine
And she's thine

946
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:30,264
She'll be yours
Till the end of time

947
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,808

[SINGING] She's so fine
And she's mine

Yes, she makes me bold
Now her love thawed out

Yes, her love thawed out

Sooner or later,
the Duke will find out too.

I have to sleep with the Duke.

Then I'll write a song.

how bad things get or whatever happens...

or whistle it or hum it...

we love one other. l won't get jealous.

the scene where the sitar player...

so that whatever is happening...

...however bad things are,
they remember their love.

The magical sitar player
falls from the roof and says:

"The greatest thing you'll
ever learn...

...is just to love and be loved
in return."

1042
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,228
This ending is silly.

1043
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,648
Why would the courtesan
go for the penniless writer?

01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:03,777

Don't like the ending, my dear Duke?

1054
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:58,290
DUKE:
Why would the courtesan choose...

1055
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,793
...a penniless sitar player
over the maharajah...

1056
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:07,132
...who is offering a lifetime of
security? That's real love.

1057
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,635
Once the sitar player
has satisfied his lust...

1058
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,221
...he will leave the courtesan
with nothing.

1059
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:17,392
I suggest that in the end,
the courtesan choose the maharajah.

1060
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,519
But, but.... Sorry.

1061
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:24,357
Sorry, but that ending does not uphold
the Bohemian ideals of...

1062
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,485
...truth, beauty, freedom--

1063
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,071
I don't care about
your ridiculous dogma!

1064
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,574
Why shouldn't the courtesan
choose the maharajah?

1065
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:34,993
