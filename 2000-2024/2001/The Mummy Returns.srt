1
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,206
<i>Five thousand years ago...</i>

2
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,125
<i>a fierce warrior known</i>
<i>as the Scorpion King...</i>

3
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>led a great army on a campaign...</i>

4
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>to conquer the known world.</i>

5
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:13,382
<i>After a vicious campaign</i>
<i>which lasted seven long years...</i>

6
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,135
<i>the Scorpion King and his army</i>
<i>were defeated...</i>

7
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,931
<i>and driven deep into</i>
<i>the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.</i>

8
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:47,166
<i>One by one, they slowly perished</i>
<i>under the scorching sun...</i>

9
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:52,922
<i>until only the great warrior himself</i>
<i>was left alive.</i>

10
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,014
<i>Near death...</i>

11
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,227
<i>the Scorpion King made a pact</i>
<i>with the dark god Anubis...</i>

12
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,021
<i>that if Anubis</i>
<i>would spare his life...</i>

13
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,691
<i>and let him conquer his enemies...</i>

14
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,443
<i>he would give him his soul.</i>

15
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,621
<i>Anubis accepted his offer</i>
<i>and spared his life.</i>

16
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,194
<i>Anubis gave the Scorpion King</i>
<i>command of his army...</i>

17
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,073
<i>and like an evil flood,</i>
<i>they washed away...</i>

18
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,451
<i>all that lay before them.</i>

19
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,047
<i>When his task was done...</i>

20
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,051
<i>Anubis forced the Scorpion King</i>
<i>to serve him for all time.</i>

21
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:31,062
<i>His army was returned</i>
<i>to the sands from whence they came...</i>

22
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:39,028
<i>where they wait, silently...</i>

23
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,280
<i>to be awakened once again.</i>

24
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,171
Alex?

25
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,090
What were you thinking,
a mummy had come back to life?

26
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,885
I'll tell you a story some time.

27
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,012
What are you doing down here?
I told you to wait for us in the temple.

28
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,889
It's dangerous down here.

29
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,683
- But I saw your tattoo.
- You saw what?

30
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:35,269
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche just like it.

31
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,688
With the pyramid and the eye...

32
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:40,608
and the two kings and everything.

33
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,610
- Really?
- Yeah.

34
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,780
Okay. Well, I'll be up to take
a look at that in a minute.

35
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,366
In the meantime, I want you
to wait for us up there.

36
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,368
Pick up your stuff,
and I'll see you up in the temple.

37
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,331
Go on.

38
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,375
And what should I do?

39
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,877
I don't know. Surprise me.

40
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,463
- Build a better mousetrap.
- Okay.

41
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,674
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.

42
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,690
Go away.

43
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,320
- Those are poisonous, you know.
- Only if they bite you.

44
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,406
What was all that about?

45
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,200
Nothing.
Alex wanted to show me something.

46
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,995
I swear...

47
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,497
the kid gets more and more
like you every day.

48
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,833
You mean
more attractive, sweet...

49
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,085
and devilishly charming?

50
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,671
No, he's driving me crazy.

51
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,548
Now, where were we?

52
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,551
Hammer and chisel.

53
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,433
All right, all right!
Let's do it your way.

54
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,934
Thank you.

55
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,830
Ever since I had that dream...

56
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,209
this place is all
I can think about.

57
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,504
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night of sleep.

58
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,591
I feel like I've been here before.

59
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,718
I know I've been here before.

60
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,013
Evy, nobody's been here before,
not in at least 3,000 years.

61
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,015
Except for these guys.

62
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,731
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I'm going?

63
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,248
Let's go.

64
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,034
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

65
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,206
You two check out that stuff,
see if it's there.

66
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,169
I'll sort out the O'Connells.

67
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,556
If you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.

68
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,392
I just had a vision.

69
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,729
It was like my dream,
but it was real.

70
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,232
It was like I was actually here
in ancient times.

71
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,776
Well, if you actually were here...

72
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,445
could you show me
how to open this thing?

73
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,989
Hold this.

74
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,966
- Now you're starting to scare me.
- I'm starting to scare myself.

75
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,928
What is this?
Look at the state of this rubbish.

76
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,181
The Egyptians never had a clue.
Look at that stuff.

77
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,642
It's all chintz and stuff.
Look at that.

78
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,438
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.

79
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,610
Jacques,
something's hit me head!

80
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,777
Shut up, Spivey.

81
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,613
This place is cursed.

82
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,535
We do not want to wake the gods.

83
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,643
That's the emblem
of the Scorpion King.

84
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,146
He's supposed to be pure myth.

85
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,149
No trace of him has ever been
found before. No artefacts.

86
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,151
No archival evidence.

87
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,237
Maybe they didn't want
anybody to find him.

88
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,322
- Let's open this.
- Evy, I don't know.

89
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,408
- I don't have a good feeling about this.
- It's only a chest.

90
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,494
No harm ever came
from opening a chest.

91
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,788
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.

92
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,666
- Remember how that one went?
- Come on. We can't stop now.

93
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,001
Just remember,
I was the voice of reason here.

94
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,169
For once.

95
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,046
Rubbish.

96
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,340
Dreck. Chintz.

97
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,889
God, that hurt!

98
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,245
Hon? Let's do it your way.

99
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,057
The bracelet of Anubis.

100
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,359
I'll take care of this.

101
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,201
Oh, my God.

102
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,078
It's a bit late for that!

103
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,415
- Put it in your rucksack.
- Let's leave it here.

104
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,043
- It's a bit late for that!
- What's it say?

105
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,004
"He who disturbs this bracelet...

106
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,215
shall drink from the Nile."

107
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,008
That doesn't sound too bad.

108
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,614
Jacques is gonna make
a nice fillet out of you, my son.

109
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,411
Spivey! Jacques!
Let's get the hell out of here!

110
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,248
Come on.

111
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,102
This is bad, Evy.

112
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,396
- We've had bad before.
- This is worse.

113
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,187
Mom? Dad?

114
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,731
I can explain everything.

115
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,636
The Book of the Dead gives life.

116
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,639
And the Book of the Living...

117
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,602
takes life away.

118
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,646
I thought that was my job.

119
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,442
We're getting close.

120
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,850
Did you acquire it?

121
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,172
We're getting very close.

122
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,022
We found him.

123
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,819
We found him! We found him!

124
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,046
Step aside there.
Out of the way.

125
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,928
Imhotep.

126
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,972
It's him. It's Imhotep.

127
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,313
Now we must raise
those that serve him.

128
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,607
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way.

129
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,234
Get out of my way
or I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

130
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,737
He means it.
He shot someone before.

131
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,113
Give it to me.

132
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,241
The opportunity passed us by.

133
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,038
- We need that bracelet.
- We need it before it opens.

134
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,835
Enough.

135
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,465
My dear Hafez...

136
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,468
I told you
I should have handled it.

137
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,679
I did not want
your past history...

138
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,389
to cloud the issue.

139
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,767
Don't worry. We know where it is.
We'll take care of it.

140
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,436
No, we'll take care of it.

141
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,314
I have a different chore
for you now.

142
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,483
Where is the bracelet?

143
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,276
It's on its way
to merry old London.

144
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,572
Then London is where we must go.

145
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,801
<i>I think the bracelet</i>
<i>is some sort of guide...</i>

146
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,970
to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere.

147
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,722
Evy, I know what you're thinking...

148
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,516
and the answer's no.

149
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,560
We just got home.

150
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,063
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.

151
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,316
Why don't you just give me
one good reason?

152
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,443
It's just an oasis...

153
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,780
darling.

154
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,867
A beautiful...

155
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,410
exciting...

156
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,037
romantic...

157
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,709
oasis.

158
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,921
The kind with the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees...

159
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,048
and the cool, clear, blue water?

160
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,636
We could have some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.

161
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,891
- Sounds good.
- Sounds too good. What's the catch?

162
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,560
Supposedly it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.

163
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,104
You see? I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.

164
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,106
How did I know that?
And let me guess.

165
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,817
It was commanded
by that Scorpion King guy?

166
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,570
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.

167
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,573
And if someone doesn't kill him,
he's gonna wipe out the world.

168
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,618
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.

169
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,621
The last known expedition
to actually reach Ahm Shere...

170
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,458
was sent by Ramses the Fourth
over 3,000 years ago.

171
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,419
- He sent over a thousand men.
- None of them was ever seen again.

172
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,505
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.

173
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,757
- Did I mention the pyramid of gold?
- Twice.

174
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,134
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.

175
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,136
- Hooray for him.
- So did Caesar.

176
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,138
- Look what happened to his career.
- And Napoleon.

177
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,516
Yeah, but we're smarter than him.

178
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,184
- Taller too.
- Exactly.

179
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,354
- That's why we're gonna find it.
- Because we're taller?

180
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,816
- That's why I love you.
- Nice try.

181
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,214
Mom!

182
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,383
What do I do with this chest?

183
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,385
Sucker weighs a goddang ton.

184
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,637
Alex, watch your language.

185
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,347
Rather weighty, this.

186
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,152
Evy, that first weird dream of yours
was exactly six weeks ago, right?

187
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,280
Yes, but what's that
got to do with anything?

188
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,993
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.

189
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,080
That's right.
What a coincidence.

190
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,292
Maybe.

191
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,794
All I'm saying
is let's be cautious.

192
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,098
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

193
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,330
You and Alex are the only thing
that matter to me.

194
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,831
Well...

195
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,461
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me...

196
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,963
to run the British Museum.

197
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,775
Cripes, how do you get
this thing off?

198
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,069
Have I kissed you today?

199
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,247
I hate it when you do that.

200
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,748
Why?

201
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,876
- Makes me agree to anything.
- Anything?

202
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,009
Those knickers are not mine.

203
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,596
Jonathan.

204
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,099
Alex, behave yourself
for five minutes, all right?

205
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,393
You betcha.

206
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,530
- Happy to be home?
- Couldn't be happier.

207
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,074
It's the Year of the Scorpion.

208
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,201
- Neat.
- Thought you might like that.

209
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,497
So I killed the mummy and his minions
and stole his sceptre.

210
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,541
Oh, you're so brave.

211
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,585
And rich.
Did I mention rich?

212
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,004
What do you think I'm doing here?

213
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,843
- Sorry, we must be in the wrong house.
- You said this was your house.

214
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,469
- I didn't.
- Call me!

215
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,765
- You're not Sheila's husband?
- No.

216
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,477
If you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.

217
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,771
I don't know any Johnny.

218
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,191
We are looking for
the bracelet of Anubis.

219
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,027
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.

220
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,820
Where is it?

221
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,615
Ah, you're looking here
for the bracelet. I see.

222
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,034
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

223
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,162
Mr. O'Connell,
you try my patience.

224
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,832
Mr. O'Connell? Hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong ma...

225
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,501
That bracelet.
Now I remember.

226
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,879
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.

227
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,928
It can't be.

228
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,354
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?

229
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,813
You mean Evy.

230
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:31,067
I think she went off to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.

231
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,445
The girl's a free spirit.
Did I mention I was single now?

232
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,412
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.

233
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:45,915
It's downstairs.

234
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:51,712
There's a safe.
The combination is 3-20-58.

235
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,130
393-something.

236
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,132
It's in the safe downstairs.

237
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,801
I told you!

238
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,469
And your point is?

239
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:02,139
- I told you so you wouldn't kill me.
- When did we make that arrangement?

240
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,570
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.

241
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,864
Well, when you're popular...

242
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:21,242
I'm serious. If you've lost
that key, you're grounded.

243
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,328
I haven't lost it. I just can't find it.
There's a difference.

244
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,248
Well, you better
start finding it then.

245
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,750
I will, Mom.
There's nothing to worry about.

246
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,545
Good evening.

247
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,675
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

248
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,178
I'm looking for the chest,
of course.

249
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,806
Give it to me now.

250
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,770
Get out of my house.

251
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:50,980
Whoa, Mom.

252
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,482
- Maybe not the best idea.
- Alex, get back there.

253
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,697
Definitely not the best idea.

254
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,116
I think it's time
to yell for Dad now.

255
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,161
- I will kill you and take it anyway.
- I think not.

256
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,374
Ardeth.
What are you doing here?

257
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,460
Perhaps explanations
are best kept for later.

258
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,128
Ardeth Bay.

259
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,214
Lock-Nah.

260
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,382
Hey, folks,
knowing my brother-in-law...

261
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,635
he probably deserves whatever
you're about to do to him...

262
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,136
but this is my house.

263
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,305
I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.

264
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,228
Shoot him!

265
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:00,174
Whoa, Mom!

266
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,969
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I have no idea.

267
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,226
That I learned from your father.

268
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,438
I'll take that.

269
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,659
Not bad for a Medjai.

270
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,917
Let go!

271
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,762
- What's in the chest?
- The bracelet of Anubis!

272
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:04,113
They must not get the bracelet.

273
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,990
Get it and get out of here!

274
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,623
Mom, look out!

275
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,583
Evelyn!

276
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,938
What'd you do this time?

277
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,190
I haven't done anything
to anybody.

278
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,610
- Lately.
- Come on!

279
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,217
Rick!

280
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,053
Look out, Rick!

281
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,314
Dad! Dad!

282
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,860
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

283
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,993
What the hell are you doing here?
Scratch that. I don't care.

284
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,162
Who are those guys
and where are they taking my wife?

285
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,165
My friend, I'm not sure...

286
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,749
but wherever this man is...

287
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,252
your wife will surely be.

288
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,673
Hey, I know him.
He's the curator.

289
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,301
- He works at the British Museum.
- Are you sure?

290
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,762
Better believe him. He spends more
time there than he does at home.

291
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,142
Okay, you're here.
The bad guys are here.

292
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,186
Evy's been kidnapped.
Let me guess.

293
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,271
They once again removed
the creature from his grave.

294
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,608
Not to point fingers, but isn't it your
job to make sure that doesn't happen?

295
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:07,069
That woman with him knows things
no living person could possibly know.

296
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,614
She knew exactly where
the creature was buried.

297
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:12,867
We hoped she would lead us to
the bracelet. She obviously did.

298
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,535
Now they have it.

299
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,538
I wouldn't get
too nervous just yet.

300
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,500
Is that gold?

301
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,502
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.

302
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,671
Then whoosh... straight across
the desert to Karnak.

303
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,674
You have started a chain reaction that
could bring about the next apocalypse.

304
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,345
You, lighten up.
You, big trouble.

305
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,347
You, get in the car.

306
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:43,314
I am sorry if I alarmed your son,
but you must understand.

307
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,274
Now that the bracelet's on...

308
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,360
we have
7 days before the Scorpion King awakens.

309
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,820
We? What we?

310
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,614
If he is not killed,
he will raise the Army of Anubis.

311
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,742
- I take it that's not a good thing.
- Oh, he'll wipe out the world.

312
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,078
The old "wipe out the world" ploy.

313
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,209
<i>Whomever can kill</i>
<i>the Scorpion King...</i>

314
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,211
can send his army back
to the Underworld...

315
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,005
or use it to destroy mankind
and rule the Earth.

316
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,260
They dug up Imhotep 'cause he's tough
enough to take out the Scorpion King.

317
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,511
That is their plan.

318
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,777
Alex, I got a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.

319
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,196
- I could do that.
- Protect the car?

320
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,241
Come on. Just because I'm a kid
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

321
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,493
- I know.
- Dad!

322
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:41,455
If you see anyone come running out
screaming, it's just me.

323
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,958
Maybe you should stay here
and watch him.

324
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,418
Now you're talking.

325
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,508
- You want the shotgun?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.

326
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,644
If I were to say to you, I'm a stranger
travelling from the east...

327
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,646
seeking that which is lost...

328
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,316
Then I would reply that I am
a stranger travelling from the west.

329
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,027
- It is I whom you seek.
- Then it is true.

330
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,155
- You have the sacred mark.
- What, that?

331
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,657
That got slapped on me
in an orphanage in Cairo.

332
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,285
That mark means
you're a protector of man...

333
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,330
a warrior for God, a Medjai.

334
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:25,291
Sorry.
You've got the wrong guy.

335
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,295
Mr. Hafez.

336
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,177
They found him.

337
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,899
Imhotep.

338
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,520
Do not be frightened.

339
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,939
I am not afraid.

340
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,386
You know...

341
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:10,016
a couple of years ago, this would've
seemed really strange to me.

342
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:17,648
Lord Imhotep will be much pleased.

343
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,577
Where is it?

344
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,954
Where is the bracelet?

345
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,957
I think I know.

346
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:39,253
At the very top of the gold pyramid,
there was a huge diamond.

347
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:40,755
How huge?

348
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:43,758
It was so big,
it would reflect the sun...

349
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:46,093
and wink at distant travellers...

350
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,013
beckoning them to their deaths.

351
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,452
Get off! Get off!

352
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,666
Oh, my God.

353
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:21,879
You wait!
I'll put you in your grave again.

354
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:25,007
Our thinking was, not if we
put you in your grave first.

355
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:27,969
Burn her!

356
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:29,220
You bast...

357
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:46,070
- Open it! Open it!
- I'm trying!

358
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,802
- Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!

359
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,930
- You broke it!
- Be quiet!

360
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:15,975
If there's gonna be any hysterics,
they'll come from me!

361
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:01,729
Go, go, go!

362
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,331
Oh, no. Not these guys again.

363
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:32,051
What are we gonna do?

364
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,929
You're asking me?
I'm only eight years old!

365
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,982
Honey, what you doin'?
These guys don't use doors.

366
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:51,070
Where the hell's Jonathan?

367
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:58,202
- Alex!
- What's the matter with my car?

368
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:01,122
I was forced to find an alternative
means of transportation.

369
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,291
- A double-decker bus?
- It was his idea.

370
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,542
- Was not!
- Was too!

371
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,711
- Just go!
- It was too!

372
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:24,937
No, not my car!

373
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:31,402
Oh, I hate mummies.

374
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:34,906
- Glad to see me now?
- Just like old times, huh?

375
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:15,756
Turn, turn!

376
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,027
No! Get out of the way!

377
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:07,183
Look out!

378
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:12,123
Great driving, Uncle Jon.

379
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:13,583
Yeah.

380
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,465
You all right?

381
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:24,635
This was my first bus ride.

382
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:35,396
- What would I do without you?
- Are all librarians this much trouble?

383
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:36,981
Jeez, get a room.

384
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,246
Let me go!

385
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:53,789
Silence!

386
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:57,001
Stop!

387
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,358
Please do not fear
for your son, my friends.

388
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,028
They cannot hurt him,
for he wears the bracelet of Anubis.

389
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:49,864
Alex is wearing the bracelet?

390
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:53,075
When he put it on, he said he saw the
pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak.

391
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,579
At Karnak, the bracelet will show him
the next step of the journey.

392
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:02,168
If we don't get to Karnak before them,
we won't know where to look for him.

393
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:04,212
Seems to me...

394
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:06,506
like we need a magic carpet.

395
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:27,985
When Lord Imhotep last
encountered the O'Connells...

396
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,572
they sent his immortal soul
to the Underworld.

397
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:35,284
As powerful as he will become,
he is still vulnerable.

398
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:38,913
Only with the Army of Anubis
will he be invincible.

399
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:42,458
He will need your help.

400
00:50:45,878 --> 00:50:47,672
Keep this with you always.

401
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:52,134
The Book of the Dead!

402
00:50:52,218 --> 00:50:54,720
What a bright little child.

403
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:58,766
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

404
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:01,269
If you wish to see her again,
you'd better behave.

405
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:03,855
Lady, I don't behave
for my parents.

406
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,982
What makes you think
I'm going to do it for you?

407
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,150
Silence!

408
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:11,612
Because your parents wouldn't slip
poisonous snakes into your bed...

409
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:13,865
while you were sleeping.

410
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,784
Lord Imhotep wishes
to meet the boy.

411
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:21,497
Now we shall see
how brave you are.

412
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:24,917
Hey, watch the suit.

413
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,836
Ow! Me fingers.

414
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:29,964
Nice.

415
00:51:33,176 --> 00:51:34,343
Very nice.

416
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:36,470
Did you acquire what we asked?

417
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:40,725
We acquired it, all right.
You know what?

418
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:44,812
We had to kill two of those guards
at the mausoleum to acquire it.

419
00:51:44,937 --> 00:51:46,314
This chest is cursed.

420
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,985
It says there is one...

421
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,487
the undead...

422
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:54,989
who will kill all those
who open this chest.

423
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:59,076
Yes, and the creature will suck them dry
then become whole again.

424
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:00,995
We've all heard this story before.

425
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,832
Yeah, but I heard the Yanks
who found it nine years ago all died.

426
00:52:04,957 --> 00:52:07,126
Horrible deaths, they were.

427
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,378
- So with that in mind...
- We want ten.

428
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:11,506
Quiet!

429
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,302
The agreement was for five.

430
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:19,222
Well, we want ten
or we'll take it elsewhere.

431
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,849
- If you...
- Ten will be just fine.

432
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,351
Follow me, gentlemen.

433
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:27,063
Get in.

434
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:51,045
It is you
who are the chosen one...

435
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,007
you who will take me
to Ahm Shere.

436
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:59,262
What if I don't?
What if I get a little lost?

437
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,100
You have strength, little one.

438
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:09,188
You are your father's son,
but I know something you don't.

439
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:11,858
This bracelet is a gift...

440
00:53:12,692 --> 00:53:14,861
and a curse.

441
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:17,363
The sands of time...

442
00:53:17,446 --> 00:53:20,116
have already begun
to pour against you.

443
00:53:24,203 --> 00:53:26,247
Yeah, I already heard this part.

444
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:28,416
From the minute
I put the bracelet on...

445
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,085
seven days do I have
before the Scorpion King wakes up.

446
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,546
Did you also hear that if you
do not enter the pyramid...

447
00:53:33,629 --> 00:53:36,090
before the sun strikes it
on that very morning...

448
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:39,677
that the bracelet
will suck the life out of you?

449
00:53:39,802 --> 00:53:41,679
That part I missed.

450
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:45,016
Hey, wait a minute. That means
I've only got five days left.

451
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:49,353
Then I believe it will be best
if we do not get lost, don't you?

452
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,149
My dad is going to kick your ass.

453
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:02,033
I do not think so.

454
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:10,791
In here, gentlemen,
you shall receive your just rewards.

455
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,085
No tricks now, woman.

456
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:15,630
We're not givin' up this chest
till we're satisfied.

457
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:19,217
Don't worry.
There is much satisfaction to be had.

458
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:29,727
What's going on?

459
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:38,069
This place is cursed.

460
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:42,114
- What is it with you and curses?
- He ain't happy without a good curse.

461
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:44,784
"This is cursed. That is cursed."

462
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:46,911
Give it a rest, will ya?

463
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,499
Christ!

464
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:03,636
He wants you to open the chest.
Open the chest!

465
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:27,785
Where'd he go?

466
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,787
Where'd he go?

467
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:22,006
- This is the magic carpet?
- It'll be fine. He's a professional.

468
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:25,968
Izzy!

469
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,684
He definitely remembers you.

470
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:36,229
He's a little shy.
Jonathan, get our bags.

471
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:39,273
- Oh, my hands are full.
- Now.

472
00:56:39,398 --> 00:56:41,734
- Right. I'll get the bags.
- I'll deal with the flight details.

473
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:46,697
- Honey, you're not a subtle man.
- We don't have time for subtle.

474
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:51,744
Izzy, come here.

475
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,832
- Doesn't look happy to see you.
- Never turned me down yet.

476
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:58,709
Whatever it is, whatever you need,
I don't care. Forget it, O'Connell.

477
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:00,878
Every time I hook up with you,
I get shot.

478
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:04,549
Last time I got shot in the ass.
I'm in mourning for my ass.

479
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:07,802
- Remember that bank job in Marrakesh?
- Bank job?

480
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:11,180
- It's not like it sounds.
- It's exactly how it sounds.

481
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:13,516
I'm flying high,
hiding in the sun.

482
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,519
The white boy here flags me down,
so I fly in low for the pick-up.

483
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:18,729
The next thing you know,
I get shot.

484
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:21,107
I'm lying in the middle of the road
with my spleen hanging out...

485
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,318
and I see him waltzing up
with some belly dancer girl.

486
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:26,404
Belly dancer girl?

487
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:28,990
- Izzy, I think you and I should talk.
- As long as I don't get shot.

488
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:31,951
Quit your whining.
You're gonna get paid this time.

489
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,582
Have you looked around here any?
What do I need money for?

490
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:40,084
What the hell am I
gonna spend it on?

491
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:42,879
I'm gonna keep this short.
My little boy's out there.

492
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:45,256
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get him back.

493
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:55,057
If you give me that gold stick,
you can shave my head...

494
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,268
wax my legs
and use me for a surfboard.

495
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,980
Didn't we do that in Tripoli?

496
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:04,233
Say, by the way,
when did you lose your eye?

497
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:08,821
I didn't. I just thought
it made me look more dashing.

498
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,658
Come on. Get to work.

499
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:17,330
- You're not catching me at my best.
- Oh, I'm sure I am.

500
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:28,299
I knew it.
I'm gonna get shot.

501
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:31,928
These are the commanders
of the 12 tribes of the Medjai.

502
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:34,931
Horus.

503
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:41,813
Pet bird.

504
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:43,606
My best and most clever friend.

505
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:46,609
He will let the commanders know
of our progress so that they may follow.

506
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:06,879
If the Army of Anubis arises...

507
00:59:08,297 --> 00:59:11,467
they will do all they can
to stop it.

508
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:15,096
- Are you sure Izzy is reliable?
- Yeah, he's reliable-ish.

509
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:23,938
- Isn't she beautiful?
- It's a balloon.

510
00:59:24,063 --> 00:59:25,773
It's a dirigible.

511
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:28,901
- Where's your airplane?
- Airplanes are a thing of the past.

512
00:59:28,985 --> 00:59:31,237
- Izzy, you were right.
- I was?

513
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,114
Yeah, you're gonna get shot.

514
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:36,117
She's faster than she looks.

515
00:59:36,242 --> 00:59:37,827
And she's real quiet.

516
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,914
Perfect for sneaking up on people,
which is a very good thing.

517
00:59:41,998 --> 00:59:44,041
Unless, of course,
we go with your approach...

518
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:47,587
barging in face first, guns blazing,
gettin' your friends shot in the ass.

519
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:53,551
Why can't you people ever
keep your feet on the ground?

520
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:43,768
O'Connell does not want to believe,
but he flies like Horus to his destiny.

521
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:47,730
Yes, very interesting.
Tell me more about this gold pyramid.

522
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:50,441
It is written that since
the time of the Scorpion King...

523
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:53,736
no man who has laid eyes upon it
has ever returned to tell the tale.

524
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,447
Where is all this stuff written?
Hello!

525
01:00:58,741 --> 01:01:00,159
Got it.

526
01:01:05,414 --> 01:01:07,083
Pretty nice, eh?

527
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,460
This is all I have left
in the world.

528
01:01:09,585 --> 01:01:11,587
The rest of my fortune was lost...

529
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:14,131
to some rather unscrupulous
characters, actually.

530
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:17,802
If the curator reacted the way you say,
it must be very important.

531
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,263
If I were you,
I would keep it close.

532
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:23,975
My friend, the gods
couldn't take this away from me.

533
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,685
- That's mine.
- No, it's not!

534
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:30,940
Keep your hands off it.

535
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:42,493
I want him back, Rick.

536
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:44,662
I want him in my arms.

537
01:01:44,787 --> 01:01:46,164
I know.

538
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:50,126
We taught him well.

539
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:53,129
He's smarter than you.

540
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:56,132
He's tougher than me.

541
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:58,801
- I love him so much, I just can't...
- I know. We both do.

542
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,678
Alex knows that.

543
01:02:02,638 --> 01:02:04,682
I'll get him back, Evy.
I promise.

544
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:06,726
I know you will.

545
01:02:33,586 --> 01:02:36,297
- Are we there yet?
- No.

546
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:51,020
That was amazing.
Perfect aim.

547
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:54,106
What are you talking about?

548
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,483
I missed.

549
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:05,993
I have to go to the bathroom.

550
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:39,026
Make it quick.

551
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:46,742
Hurry up.

552
01:03:50,746 --> 01:03:52,915
- Hey, reading material!
- Now!

553
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:01,007
I can't go when someone's watching.

554
01:04:03,092 --> 01:04:05,761
I don't trust you.
You'll look.

555
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:15,855
Darn!

556
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:21,068
Oh, my God!

557
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:24,405
Doesn't anyone around here know
how to flush a toilet?

558
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,050
Karnak.

559
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:09,969
If a man does not embrace his past,
he has no future.

560
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:11,429
Look...

561
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:15,808
even if I was some sort
of sacred Medjai...

562
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,810
what good does that do me now?

563
01:06:17,894 --> 01:06:20,021
It is the missing piece
of your heart.

564
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:23,941
If you embrace it and accept it,
you can do anything.

565
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:25,568
Sounds great.

566
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:28,696
Listen, what can we expect
from our old friend Imhotep?

567
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,449
His powers are returning quickly.

568
01:06:31,574 --> 01:06:35,119
When he reaches Ahm Shere, even the
Scorpion King won't be able to stop him.

569
01:12:35,188 --> 01:12:38,983
Evy, I know you haven't been yourself
lately with these dreams and visions...

570
01:12:39,108 --> 01:12:41,777
No, they're memories
from my previous life.

571
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:44,655
Honestly, I'm not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.

572
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:47,325
- That's why we found the bracelet?
- Exactly.

573
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,495
- I was its protector.
- Now do you believe, my friend?

574
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,914
Clearly, you were destined
to protect this woman.

575
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,167
Right. She's a reincarnated princess,
and I'm a warrior for God.

576
01:12:56,292 --> 01:13:00,338
Your son leads the way to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.

577
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:03,216
This was all preordained
thousands of years ago.

578
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:04,967
And how does the story end?

579
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:07,720
Only the journey's written,
not the destination.

580
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:08,888
Convenient.

581
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,015
How else do you explain
Evy's visions?

582
01:13:11,098 --> 01:13:13,893
That it is your son
who wears the bracelet?

583
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:16,646
- How do you explain your mark?
- Coincidence.

584
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:21,025
My friend, there is a fine line
between coincidence and fate.

585
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,130
Don't even think about it.

586
01:13:47,176 --> 01:13:49,762
Hold on there, partner.

587
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:54,892
When the time comes...

588
01:13:55,017 --> 01:13:58,729
I shall truly enjoy killing you.

589
01:13:59,605 --> 01:14:02,066
But until that time...

590
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:05,153
you'd better be
a little nicer to me.

591
01:14:05,278 --> 01:14:07,446
Now, where's my water?

592
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:13,119
No ice?

593
01:14:17,748 --> 01:14:19,667
Make sure he doesn't move!

594
01:14:50,072 --> 01:14:52,533
They've gone.
We've lost them.

595
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,270
Alex left us his tie...

596
01:15:21,395 --> 01:15:25,191
and he made us
a little sand castle.

597
01:15:25,274 --> 01:15:27,735
It's the Temple Island of Philae.

598
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,738
- They've gone to Philae.
- Attaboy, Alex. Come on!

599
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:45,294
The great temple of Abu Simbel.

600
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:16,302
That's the Blue Nile down there.
We must be out of Egypt by now.

601
01:17:16,385 --> 01:17:20,264
In ancient times, all this
still belonged to the upper kingdom.

602
01:17:20,389 --> 01:17:22,600
The oasis must be
around here somewhere.

603
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:25,603
Don't worry. We'll find him.
He's a smart kid.

604
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:27,647
He'll leave us a sign.

605
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,779
Surprised to see me?

606
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:37,198
Leaving bread crumbs, huh?

607
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,504
We're in trouble!

608
01:18:46,476 --> 01:18:47,602
Horus, fly!

609
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:55,026
Izzy, come hard right!
Starboard! Starboard!

610
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,863
Was there a little something
you forgot to mention?

611
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:46,828
People?

612
01:20:05,721 --> 01:20:07,849
Ahm Shere.

613
01:20:18,025 --> 01:20:19,485
Right.

614
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:27,368
He's back!

615
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,540
Hang on!

616
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,097
Well, that's not good.

617
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:51,392
Hang on!

618
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:00,485
Mom?

619
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:02,695
Dad?

620
01:21:11,245 --> 01:21:13,122
We're gonna go get my son.

621
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:16,125
Then we're gonna want to get out of here
fast, so make this work, Izzy.

622
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:20,463
You don't understand. This thing was
filled with gas. Not hot air, gas.

623
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:24,217
I need gas to get this thing in the air.
Where am I gonna get gas around here?

624
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,969
Bananas? Mangoes?
Tarzan's ass?

625
01:21:27,053 --> 01:21:30,306
Maybe I could finagle it
to take hot air.

626
01:21:30,389 --> 01:21:33,601
But do you know how many cubic meters
I'd need? It's too big!

627
01:21:33,684 --> 01:21:37,605
If anybody can fill this thing up
with hot air, Izzy, it's you.

628
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,822
Come to Daddy.

629
01:21:58,709 --> 01:22:01,003
So, Rick, what's the plan?

630
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:02,922
Let's find some higher ground.

631
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:31,242
- I must go.
- Where?

632
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:33,578
To tell the commanders where we are.

633
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:36,747
- If the Army of Anubis arises...
- I need you to help me find my son.

634
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:45,715
Then first I shall help you.
Thank you.

635
01:23:24,253 --> 01:23:26,631
Look. Roman legionnaires.

636
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:32,970
And here, turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon's troops.

637
01:23:33,054 --> 01:23:36,140
What in the name of Anubis did this?

638
01:23:56,619 --> 01:23:58,704
- You hear that?
- What?

639
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,833
Nothing.

640
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:03,501
Absolutely nothing.

641
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:07,839
My word!

642
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,386
I say, chaps, look at this.

643
01:24:13,469 --> 01:24:17,265
Shrunken heads.
I'd love to know how they do that.

644
01:24:20,059 --> 01:24:21,477
Just curious.

645
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:28,860
You any good with that?

646
01:24:28,985 --> 01:24:32,530
Three times <i>Fox and Hound's</i>
grand champion. You any good with that?

647
01:24:34,615 --> 01:24:36,325
You'll know soon enough...

648
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:40,621
because the only way to kill an Anubis
warrior is by taking off its head.

649
01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:43,624
I'll remember that.

650
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,131
Try to remember to...

651
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:55,094
just keep it tight
in the shoulder and...

652
01:24:56,679 --> 01:24:59,474
lead the target a little bit,
and then...

653
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:02,810
squeeze the trigger...
don't pull it.

654
01:25:05,188 --> 01:25:07,064
I won't miss.

655
01:25:46,229 --> 01:25:47,355
Pyramid.

656
01:25:49,106 --> 01:25:51,526
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.

657
01:25:51,651 --> 01:25:54,403
Now may I kill him?

658
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:08,668
- Retrieve that bracelet.
- With pleasure.

659
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:38,489
Something is coming.

660
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:04,015
That's my husband
and my son down there.

661
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,267
Make me proud.

662
01:27:06,642 --> 01:27:08,519
Today's that day, Evy.

663
01:27:16,486 --> 01:27:17,737
Where's the boy?

664
01:28:36,732 --> 01:28:38,317
The Black Book!

665
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:45,324
Let's go!

666
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:16,355
There you are!

667
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:20,860
The time has come,
my little friend.

668
01:29:20,943 --> 01:29:23,112
Let go!

669
01:29:39,962 --> 01:29:42,924
- Dad!
- Alex!

670
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:06,364
Time to remove that bracelet,
my good son.

671
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:18,501
Behind you!

672
01:31:42,084 --> 01:31:44,962
- Let's go.
- Thank God for that.

673
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:55,890
The two of you must
sacrifice yourselves for me.

674
01:31:56,933 --> 01:31:59,393
You shall be rewarded in heaven!

675
01:32:17,203 --> 01:32:18,621
Nice shootin', Tex.

676
01:32:18,704 --> 01:32:21,958
- What were those creepy pygmy things?
- Just the local natives.

677
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,043
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. It was nothing.

678
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:27,421
Come on, Mom. Come on, Dad.
We have to get to the pyramid.

679
01:32:27,547 --> 01:32:29,423
I have to get the bracelet off now!

680
01:32:29,549 --> 01:32:31,551
Leave it on.
Looks good on you.

681
01:32:31,634 --> 01:32:33,719
No, you guys, you don't understand.

682
01:32:33,803 --> 01:32:38,558
It'll kill me if I don't get inside
the pyramid before the sun hits it...

683
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:39,684
today!

684
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:41,644
Oh, my God.

685
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,357
Time to go!

686
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,318
I thought you said
it was nothing!

687
01:33:02,165 --> 01:33:03,833
Where's Jonathan?

688
01:33:13,843 --> 01:33:16,721
Look! There's a burial ground!
We're safe! We're safe!

689
01:33:16,846 --> 01:33:19,182
They'll never cross
those sacred stones!

690
01:33:19,265 --> 01:33:22,435
- You are sure?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

691
01:33:37,366 --> 01:33:38,993
Sorry. My mistake.

692
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,671
- Wait for me!
- Hurry up, Jonathan!

693
01:33:51,798 --> 01:33:53,591
Wait for me!

694
01:33:53,716 --> 01:33:57,178
- What's that for?
- Just something in case of an emergency.

695
01:34:19,826 --> 01:34:21,244
Let's go, Alex.

696
01:34:30,336 --> 01:34:33,756
Run! Come on, Alex, faster!

697
01:34:35,758 --> 01:34:38,010
Dad! The bracelet!

698
01:34:38,094 --> 01:34:40,429
Come on! Come on!

699
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:04,745
You know...

700
01:35:04,871 --> 01:35:07,915
it's not easy being a dad.

701
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:12,253
Yeah, but you do it really good.

702
01:35:13,379 --> 01:35:14,547
Thanks.

703
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:36,402
They made it.
Thank God.

704
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,655
Yes. Great.

705
01:35:39,739 --> 01:35:41,574
Fabulous.

706
01:36:10,603 --> 01:36:13,731
- She's going to be all right, isn't she?
- She'll be fine.

707
01:36:13,856 --> 01:36:15,274
Take him.

708
01:36:15,358 --> 01:36:17,068
Mommy's fine.

709
01:36:17,193 --> 01:36:18,528
It's okay.

710
01:36:19,362 --> 01:36:21,739
Your mother's
going to be fine. Okay?

711
01:36:23,032 --> 01:36:25,743
You're real strong.
You're gonna make it.

712
01:36:25,868 --> 01:36:27,161
You're fine.

713
01:36:28,287 --> 01:36:30,206
What do I do?

714
01:36:34,043 --> 01:36:36,295
Take care of Alex.

715
01:36:39,882 --> 01:36:41,300
Sweetheart, no.

716
01:36:43,386 --> 01:36:44,929
I love you.

717
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:04,157
Come back, Evy.

718
01:37:07,076 --> 01:37:08,452
Come back.

719
01:38:35,915 --> 01:38:37,333
Stay here.

720
01:40:12,094 --> 01:40:14,847
Try to think of it
like this, Alex.

721
01:40:14,931 --> 01:40:17,350
She's gone to a better place.

722
01:40:17,433 --> 01:40:20,311
- Like it says in the good book.
- The book!

723
01:40:20,436 --> 01:40:22,230
- What?
- That's it.

724
01:40:22,355 --> 01:40:23,773
- That's it!
- That's what?

725
01:40:23,856 --> 01:40:27,068
Come on, Uncle Jon!
That's it! The book!

726
01:40:36,369 --> 01:40:38,538
You're too late, O'Connell.

727
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:40,498
I have released
the Army of Anubis.

728
01:40:40,623 --> 01:40:43,918
Lord Imhotep shall soon
kill the Scorpion King...

729
01:40:44,043 --> 01:40:46,003
and take command.

730
01:40:46,129 --> 01:40:48,047
Not after I get through with him.

731
01:41:29,255 --> 01:41:32,216
You realize, of course,
that this can only be done...

732
01:41:32,341 --> 01:41:34,760
by someone who can actually read
ancient Egyptian.

733
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:37,805
I don't know about you,
but I'm a tad rusty.

734
01:41:39,098 --> 01:41:41,517
- Now where?
- We go right.

735
01:41:41,601 --> 01:41:43,978
How do you know?

736
01:41:46,105 --> 01:41:49,525
Basically,
"This way to the Scorpion King."

737
01:41:51,027 --> 01:41:52,403
Mum taught me.

738
01:41:55,781 --> 01:41:57,700
This just might work.

739
01:42:28,731 --> 01:42:31,234
It's time someone taught you
a lesson, wench. Come on.

740
01:42:40,076 --> 01:42:41,661
This is for my sister.

741
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,814
Is that all you've got?

742
01:45:25,241 --> 01:45:26,993
Hurry up, Alex!

743
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:24,342
Uncle Jon, I don't know
what this last symbol is!

744
01:46:24,467 --> 01:46:26,010
What's it look like?

745
01:46:26,135 --> 01:46:27,845
It's a bird. A stork!

746
01:46:30,306 --> 01:46:33,351
I know that one!
I know that one!

747
01:46:33,476 --> 01:46:35,394
Then what is it?

748
01:46:39,816 --> 01:46:41,234
That's it!

749
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,113
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

750
01:47:27,864 --> 01:47:28,990
Oh, my God.

751
01:47:29,115 --> 01:47:31,117
- Evy!
- Take Alex. Go and help Rick.

752
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,244
- But, Mom...
- No "buts."

753
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:34,287
Come on.

754
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:39,792
I'll be just fine.

755
01:47:39,876 --> 01:47:41,878
- We did it, Uncle Jon!
- Right, partner.

756
01:47:41,961 --> 01:47:43,880
Now let's go help your dad.

757
01:49:46,502 --> 01:49:48,504
That's a little something new.

758
01:50:16,699 --> 01:50:18,868
My lord!

759
01:50:20,453 --> 01:50:22,371
Save me! Save me!

760
01:51:47,707 --> 01:51:50,001
Okay, now I'm a believer.

761
01:51:56,048 --> 01:51:57,133
It's a spear!

762
01:51:57,216 --> 01:51:59,927
The golden stick thing!
It's a spear!

763
01:52:00,052 --> 01:52:03,055
Really?
Doesn't look like a spear!

764
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:05,766
That's because
it opens up into one!

765
01:52:05,892 --> 01:52:08,227
Yes? And?

766
01:52:08,311 --> 01:52:11,939
It opens up into a spear!

767
01:53:07,203 --> 01:53:09,747
- Twist it!
- Push!

768
01:53:09,872 --> 01:53:11,082
You have to pull!

769
01:53:13,793 --> 01:53:15,211
Jonathan, quick!

770
01:53:29,976 --> 01:53:32,645
Throw it!
Kill the Scorpion King!

771
01:53:32,728 --> 01:53:34,730
Send his army
back to the Underworld!

772
01:53:34,814 --> 01:53:37,733
Step aside, Alex.
I'm a professional.

773
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:45,301
Go to hell,
and take your friends with you!

774
01:56:22,648 --> 01:56:25,568
Get out of here!
Just get out of here!

775
01:56:46,756 --> 01:56:47,924
Hang on, Rick!

776
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,418
Let's go up!

777
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:28,691
This whole damn place is gonna
get sucked up! Let's move up! Go!

778
01:58:42,121 --> 01:58:43,706
Go, Alex!

779
01:58:54,634 --> 01:58:56,552
Rick, we're trapped!

780
01:59:09,816 --> 01:59:13,820
Get your butts moving! Hurry up!
I haven't got all day!

781
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:19,784
You're next! Go!

782
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,252
Jonathan! Hold on!

783
01:59:29,335 --> 01:59:32,463
- Pull him up!
- Pull me up!

784
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:38,261
Wait! Wait!
Let me down! Let me down!

785
01:59:38,344 --> 01:59:41,764
- It's not worth your life, you idiot!
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

786
01:59:44,767 --> 01:59:46,269
Right.

787
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:56,237
Pull me up! Pull me up!

788
02:00:15,631 --> 02:00:19,177
- O'Connell, you almost got me killed!
- At least you didn't get shot.

789
02:00:21,554 --> 02:00:24,474
Thank you! Thank you!

790
02:00:28,478 --> 02:00:31,606
O'Connell, who the hell have you
been messing with this time, huh?

791
02:00:31,731 --> 02:00:32,982
You know, the usual.

792
02:00:33,065 --> 02:00:36,277
Mummies, pygmies...

793
02:00:36,402 --> 02:00:38,321
big bugs.

794
02:01:06,849 --> 02:01:09,769
I thought
I almost lost you there.

795
02:01:09,852 --> 02:01:11,771
For a moment there, you did.

796
02:01:13,189 --> 02:01:15,691
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like?

797
02:01:17,026 --> 02:01:18,486
Later.

798
02:01:22,532 --> 02:01:24,617
- Oh, please!
- Oh, please!

799
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:26,786
- That's half mine, you know.
- What?

800
02:01:26,869 --> 02:01:30,206
- That's half mine.
- What are you talking about?

801
02:01:30,289 --> 02:01:32,458
You took my gold stick!

802
02:01:32,542 --> 02:01:36,796
I swear on the head of my wife, I have
no idea what you're talking about.

803
02:01:36,879 --> 02:01:38,714
You ain't got a wife!

804
02:01:38,798 --> 02:01:41,217
I don't have
your gold stick either!
