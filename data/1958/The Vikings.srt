1
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,040
The Vikings, in Europe of
the 8th and 9th Century...

2
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,108
were dedicated
to a pagan god of war, Odin.

3
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:43,786
Cramped by the confines of their
barren, icebound northlands...

4
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:46,190
they exploited their skill
as shipbuilders...

5
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,490
to spread a reign of terror...

6
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:51,895
then unequaled
in violence and brutality...

7
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:54,765
in all the records of history.

8
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,565
The greatest wish
of every Viking...

9
00:00:57,604 --> 00:01:01,540
was to die sword in hand,
and enter Valhalla...

10
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,304
where a hero's welcome
awaited them...

11
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:05,208
from the god Odin.

12
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:11,115
The compass was unknown...

13
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:14,609
and they could steer only
by the sun and the stars.

14
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:23,556
Once fog closed in, they were
left helpless and blind.

15
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:26,122
After all, the earth was flat.

16
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,191
Sail too far off course...

17
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,362
and the black wind
would blowthem...

18
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,100
across the Poison Sea
that lay to the west...

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,574
and over the edge
of the world into limbo.

20
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:41,709
Their abiding aim
was to conquer England...

21
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:45,047
then a series
of petty kingdoms...

22
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:48,020
each one
the jealous rival of the next.

23
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:52,320
Thus, when the Vikings set forth
to rob and plunder England...

24
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,192
they never sailed
out of sight of land.

25
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,597
They confined their attacks
to swift, overnight raids.

26
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,965
It was no accident that
the English "Book of Prayer"...

27
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,163
contained this sentence...

28
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:08,573
"Protect us, Oh Lord,
from the wrath of the Northmen."

29
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:11,310
Ragnar!

30
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,752
The king is dead.

31
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:30,255
Long live the king.

32
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:40,228
For two months, we have
mourned the good King Edwin...

33
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:44,067
who by the cruel Viking Ragnar
was foully murdered...

34
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:47,198
and still lies unrevenged.

35
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,643
The council of the kingdom
now declare that Aella...

36
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:54,169
is of the true royal line...

37
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:57,081
and welcome his succession
to the throne.

38
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,126
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,297
Thank you, my gracious lady.

40
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,671
You may rest assured
that the barbarians...

41
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,505
that murdered
your husband, my cousin...

42
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,876
will soon feel
the weight of my anger.

43
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:29,973
And though your union
with Edwin was fruitless...

44
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:34,112
feel confident that you retain
the respect of us all.

45
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:39,051
You may retire, Queen Enid.

46
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,527
We...

47
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,195
Thurston Bishop
and Matthew Bishop...

48
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:54,536
ask you will you take
Aella as your king...

49
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:58,670
You need not fear, my lady.
His words cannot hurt you.

50
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,180
He has no right to the throne.

51
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:04,615
There is no direct heir,
my lady.

52
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:06,915
There is an heir.

53
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:10,256
What?

54
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,884
Brother Godwin,
I am with child...

55
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,791
but not Edwin's.

56
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,820
The child is that
of the Viking Ragnar.

57
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,914
A bad omen.

58
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,588
The holy sword Requiter...

59
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,360
the sword of kings.

60
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,959
Long live the king!

61
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,698
He's the son of a barbarian...

62
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,005
but I love him
as if he were Edwin's child.

63
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,841
There are already
rumors of his birth.

64
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,437
If they were to reach Aella...

65
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,880
Where are you sending him?

66
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,215
To Italy.
To be tended by monks...

67
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,584
who will not know his identity.

68
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,316
But his life will be safe...

69
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,290
and yours, too.

70
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,293
Father Godwin!

71
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:01,426
The pommel stone
of the sword Requiter.

72
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,129
It is his by right.

73
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,500
If you hope
to identify him...

74
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:06,767
in years to come
by means of this stone...

75
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,637
so can his enemies.

76
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,473
Twenty years passed.

77
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,139
Queen Enid had died...

78
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,080
but the rumor that
she had given birth to a son...

79
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:18,516
continued to plague King Aella.

80
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:21,850
Although his castle became
the stronghold of all England...

81
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:24,755
Aella was unable to stop
the Viking raids.

82
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,225
Now let it be known...

83
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,785
throughout the kingdom
of Northumbria...

84
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,730
that l,
King Rhodri of Wales...

85
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,700
bestow on King Aella...

86
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:37,999
the hand of
my daughter Morgana.

87
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,198
I will consent to this.

88
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:46,408
l, too,
King Rhodri of Wales, consent.

89
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,573
Praise be to God!

90
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,048
Amen.

91
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,156
Please rise, child.

92
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:15,466
On the first day of Spring,
you will become my bride.

93
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,885
I trust, Lord Egbert...

94
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,012
that you approve
of this alliance?

95
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,216
With all my heart, sire.

96
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,724
Then why do you spread tales...

97
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,195
of an heir to the throne
left by Queen Enid?

98
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,857
'Tis common knowledge, sire.

99
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,060
The queen on her deathbed
spoke of a son...

100
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,399
sent off to Italy
with the pommel stone...

101
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,701
of the sword Requiter
tied about him.

102
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,730
Your Majesty, is it wise...

103
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:51,073
to speak of things
so long in the past?

104
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,944
I hope soon to silence
these wagging tongues.

105
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:57,074
This beautiful child...

106
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,947
will present me with
an heir to the throne.

107
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,253
And this marriage...

108
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,686
will combine the strength
of Wales and Northumbria...

109
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,450
and protect our people...

110
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,686
from the depredation
of the Vikings.

111
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,626
That is not enough!

112
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:12,324
I must also expose
a traitor in our midst.

113
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,300
Surely there are no traitors
in this hall, sire.

114
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,198
Cousin Egbert,
why have your lands...

115
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,004
never been attacked
by the Vikings?

116
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,135
What do you mean, sire?

117
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,202
Neither your lands...

118
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:28,043
nor the lands of
your fellow conspirators...

119
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,343
have ever suffered
any real harm.

120
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,714
For years,
you have schemed against me!

121
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,048
I'll not be made a scapegoat...

122
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,054
for your failure
to stop the Viking raids!

123
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,817
You have conspired
with the foes of England...

124
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,221
to unseat me
from my throne!

125
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:39,725
-What foes?
-The Vikings!

126
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,192
Take him out!

127
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,057
Lies will not sustain a tyrant!

128
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:02,672
Use skill. It must appear
as if he took his own life.

129
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:16,755
He's gone, sire!

130
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,286
Hunt him down!

131
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,933
Bring me his head!

132
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:38,941
Hail, Ragnar.

133
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,280
You're late. We've been
waiting half the night.

134
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,846
I nearly
didn't get here at all.

135
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,084
Aella knows of our meetings.

136
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:47,718
I barely escaped with my life.
Take me with you!

137
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,524
He is no more use to us.
Send him back.

138
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:54,294
That's no way to reward a man
who's guided our raids.

139
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,632
No, we'll find
good use for him.

140
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:59,001
Come aboard.

141
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,733
Make sail for Long Sound.

142
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,071
Make sail for Long Sound!

143
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,537
Ragnar!

144
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,786
Come on.

145
00:15:55,434 --> 00:16:01,930
Hail, Ragnar! Hail, Ragnar!

146
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,265
Hail, Ragnar!

147
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,965
Hail, Einar!

148
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:45,274
I drink to your safe return
in English ale!

149
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,621
I wish that
it were English blood.

150
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,123
Hold your mouth!

151
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,718
This is an Englishman.

152
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,288
Englishman?

153
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,925
Lord Egbert. An ally.

154
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,834
Then drink to
my father's return, Englishman!

155
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:13,700
Do you want the English
to think we're barbarians?

156
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,476
This is Einar,
my only son in wedlock.

157
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:17,880
He's so vain of his beauty...

158
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,885
he won't let
a man's beard hide it.

159
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,979
He scrapes his face
like an Englishman.

160
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,990
Hail, Ragnar.

161
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,616
And hail Ragnar's beard!

162
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,898
I want you to teach
Lord Egbert our customs.

163
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,092
I'll teach him.

164
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,067
Remember,
I live by brains, not brawn.

165
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,228
Yes, my lord.

166
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,964
Then fetch him a horse!

167
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,301
-Now?
-Why not?

168
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,239
Einar!

169
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,071
Gently, gently.

170
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,601
I know. Brains, not brawn.

171
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:52,114
He's got to draw us maps
of the English coast!

172
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:55,985
What man ever had a finer son?

173
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,080
Odin could have sired him.

174
00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,648
But I did.

175
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:00,886
Come!

176
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,268
Don't be frightened.

177
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,433
She's forbidden
to hunt Englishmen.

178
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,204
Too much for her to swallow.

179
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,212
We have the same sport
in England.

180
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:22,476
With hawks like this?

181
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:23,982
Watch.

182
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,491
Kill.

183
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,874
You call that a hawk?

184
00:18:57,383 --> 00:19:00,477
I think we have hawks
to equal that one.

185
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,009
Here.

186
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,919
Bring up Long Claw.

187
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,424
Look, nowthere's
a hunting bird.

188
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,540
You again.

189
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:24,702
Whose bird is that?

190
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:25,869
It's mine.

191
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:29,108
A slave with a hunting hawk?

192
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:31,048
I found her frozen to a tree.

193
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,209
Where'd you steal it?

194
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:35,277
Sandpiper was with me
when I found her.

195
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:39,280
The perfect witness...
deaf and dumb.

196
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,259
Perhaps you'd like
your own tongue cut out.

197
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:42,817
Then you'll tell no more lies.

198
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,454
I'm not a liar.

199
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:47,364
Is this the way
slaves talk to Vikings?

200
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,937
Tell the English lord
that you're a liar.

201
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,811
Kill!

202
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,986
Kill him!

203
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:19,658
No!

204
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,098
Don't kill him.

205
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:12,014
Odin!

206
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,560
Bring in the slave.

207
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:43,014
Look how he glares at me.

208
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,039
If he wasn't fathered
by a black ram...

209
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:48,383
in the full of the moon,
my name is not Ragnar.

210
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,220
What would you do with him
in your country?

211
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:55,124
We have a special reward
which is rather entertaining...

212
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,627
in a noisy way.

213
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:57,788
What's that?

214
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,457
It's nothing much...

215
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,728
just a pit full of wolves
half-mad with starvation...

216
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,759
and trained to appreciate
the flavor of human blood.

217
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:09,069
You see?
The English are civilized!

218
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,736
Can you think of anything worse?

219
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,745
I can think
of something far worse.

220
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,269
I guess you can...

221
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,714
with your pretty,
dainty face spoiled.

222
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,241
But he was a good slave.

223
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,752
Kill him quick.

224
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:25,086
No...
No quick death for him.

225
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:27,285
What do you suggest
I do with him?

226
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,752
Nothing.

227
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,286
Nothing?

228
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,767
I want this slave alive.

229
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,930
You want him to live
after tearing your face apart?

230
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:41,405
Yes.

231
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,409
The sun will cross the sky
a thousand times...

232
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,468
before he dies.

233
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:55,286
And you'll wish
a thousand times...

234
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,720
that you were dead.

235
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,362
Kitala!

236
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,732
You can't kill the slave.

237
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:20,407
What do the runes say?

238
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:33,147
If Odin willed
that Eric should die...

239
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,491
Thor's hammer would sound
his death knell.

240
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,357
But the sky is silent.

241
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,503
The curse of Odin
waits on him...

242
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,100
who kills the slave.

243
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:08,717
Then no man shall kill him.

244
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,059
Let the tide of the sea do it!

245
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:14,224
Bind him! Cast him into
the slop pool at lowtide.

246
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,631
Take him out.

247
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,467
You'll not kill him...

248
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,199
but you throw him
into the slop pool...

249
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,002
to be drowned
and eaten by crabs!

250
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,406
Then let the crabs
be cursed by Odin!

251
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:25,876
That's my decision.

252
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:39,324
If he survives the pool,
what then?

253
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:42,452
If he's still alive
when the tide turns...

254
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:45,759
then any fool who fishes him out
can have him.

255
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,789
Survives.

256
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:22,400
Odin...

257
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,733
send a wind and turn the tide.

258
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,421
Put her in the testing board.

259
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:06,410
I think I'll go and watch
that slave drowning.

260
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:07,810
Stay here!

261
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:10,838
You'll see something
more interesting.

262
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,817
It does look rather
an interesting game.

263
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,383
It's not a game.

264
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,658
It's Odin's test
for unfaithful wives.

265
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:32,265
Is she an unfaithful wife?

266
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,468
Ask Einar.

267
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:37,736
Her husband says she is.

268
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,641
Which is he?

269
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,373
He's throwing the axes.

270
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:55,182
But if she's innocent?

271
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:57,855
Her husband will succeed.
The braids will be cut.

272
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:07,836
Supposing he misses the braids
and hits her?

273
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:10,034
Well, then, she's guilty.

274
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,066
Oh, I see.

275
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,181
But what happens
if he misses...

276
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,483
both the girl and the braids?

277
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,649
Three misses and we drown him.

278
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:55,547
One!

279
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:06,287
You're too drunk!

280
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,390
You'll split her wide open!

281
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,266
Drunk, am I?

282
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,770
I haven't had enough!

283
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,692
You missed her, didn't you?

284
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,227
What a son!

285
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,113
Kitala.

286
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:41,421
Kitala, my legs.

287
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,759
Move your legs, Eric.
You must move them.

288
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:02,246
Where did this slave boy
come from?

289
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,544
Bjorn brought him here
from a raid.

290
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,950
He was taken
from a ship on the sea.

291
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:10,045
And this was found
about his neck?

292
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:13,387
Yes. It's the only possession
he ever had.

293
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,757
He has no need of it now.

294
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,694
He's going to die.

295
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,763
Listen to me, little slave.

296
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:33,176
Einar is in the hall
celebrating your death.

297
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:35,975
Einar is laughing at you!

298
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,947
Live, Eric. Fight the cold!

299
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:44,285
Live and fight Einar!

300
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,382
Fight Einar.

301
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,393
Fight Einar.

302
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:11,244
Odin has answered you.

303
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,251
They were only flying clouds.

304
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,082
You are blind.

305
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,611
They were Odin's daughters.

306
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:19,920
I heard the singing
of their battle swords...

307
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,926
as they rode across the sky.

308
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,555
They bring the wind!

309
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,827
They bring the wind!

310
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,325
Listen!

311
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,899
The North wind!

312
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:47,775
It's turning back the tide!

313
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,746
Cut him loose!

314
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:57,149
Tide is going out.
Your job is done.

315
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,324
I'll take the slave.

316
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:42,256
He's mine, Einar.

317
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,269
The wind turned the tide,
and I pulled him out.

318
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:47,737
I'll take him, Englishman!

319
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:51,264
If your father's word
means anything, he's mine.

320
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:55,006
Why such a sudden interest
in the slave, my lord?

321
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,105
Shall we say
an English passion...

322
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:00,914
for converting the wicked
to the paths of righteousness?

323
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,614
Well, you're not in England now.

324
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,726
And you never will be...

325
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:12,321
unless I draw maps of England
for your father.

326
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:21,632
All right.

327
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:23,800
You can keep the slave...

328
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:26,242
for as long as you live.

329
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,013
Odin's thanks for saving him.

330
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:40,081
And at no little risk to myself.

331
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,691
Do you know what this is?

332
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,928
Some day,
I'll tell you what it is...

333
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,133
and you'll remember then
that I saved you.

334
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,800
I'm still a slave.

335
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,167
You won't be
when we get to England.

336
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,831
I'll never get to England.

337
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,499
You're like a wounded animal.

338
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,475
You trust no one.

339
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:32,874
Good day, my lords.

340
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:35,243
Hail, Egbert!
How's the boat coming along?

341
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,578
She'll be ready in a week.

342
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:40,584
Well, she's no Sea Dragon,
but she'll do for a toy.

343
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:42,848
Does Einar still bear me
a grudge?

344
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,752
I still think you're a fool
to anger my son.

345
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,256
He'll kill you one day.

346
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:48,919
You're not still angry,
are you, Einar?

347
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,928
That depends.

348
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,589
On what?

349
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,664
On how well you draw maps.

350
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:00,271
See for yourself.

351
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,637
This is a map of Wales.

352
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:05,040
Wales? That slag heap?

353
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,044
That's not worth
one night's raiding.

354
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,909
It holds
the richest prize of all...

355
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:11,882
King Rhodri's daughter Morgana.

356
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:15,352
Rhodri couldn't raise enough
to ransom a skagerrak moose.

357
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:18,822
No, but Aella could.
He's to marry her in the spring.

358
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:24,721
I think our Englishman
has a good idea.

359
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:27,230
She's leaving soon
and must go round this point.

360
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:28,732
Here? You're sure?

361
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:30,233
I'd stake my life on it.

362
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:32,395
You already have.

363
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:35,895
Let me intercept her
and bring her back here.

364
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,067
How many men would you need?

365
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,076
One boat.

366
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,237
-Only one boat?
-No more.

367
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,871
What about him...

368
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,245
without the collar?

369
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,544
You'll take him along?

370
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,178
Naturally,
I'll take along my slave.

371
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,188
You stay here and draw maps.

372
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:53,190
I'll kidnap the girl.

373
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:01,064
Ragnar, try to get him
to draw maps...

374
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:03,033
that'll guide
a ship through fog...

375
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,035
and then maybe
he'll be worth having around.

376
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,866
There is no map
of any use in fog.

377
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,839
Then what use are you to us?

378
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:10,841
Think of that while I'm gone.

379
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,435
And don't let anything
happen to that slave.

380
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:24,952
It's a strange metal...

381
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,719
that fell to earth
from the North star.

382
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:30,193
Sandpiper brought it
from far away.

383
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:34,494
The price he paid
was his ears and his tongue.

384
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,227
No matter how you hold it...

385
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,235
it always struggles
to return homeward...

386
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:39,827
to the star
from which it fell.

387
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,999
It always points to the north.

388
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,508
Not in the fog.

389
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:47,170
It cannot see the stars
in the fog.

390
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,445
Watch.

391
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,682
Can it see the star
through these walls?

392
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,167
This could lead you
to many places.

393
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:19,540
Even to the land
beyond the Poison Sea...

394
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,374
Valhalla.

395
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:23,880
You will go there one day.

396
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:26,577
Only great heroes
have ever reached it.

397
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,415
See what the runes say.

398
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:39,194
Will this take me there?

399
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,305
A woman will point the way.

400
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,247
What will she look like?

401
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,249
You will know her
when you see her.

402
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:00,682
When will that be?

403
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,049
Soon enough.

404
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:06,381
Will she love me or hate me?

405
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:10,121
Love and hate
are horns on the same goat.

406
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,863
What woman would ever
look at a slave?

407
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,457
This one will.

408
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:24,868
You're lying, Kitala.

409
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:30,880
All your tales are lies.

410
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:04,077
Don't look so sad, my lady.
It doesn't become you.

411
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:07,084
Bridget, how can I marry
a man that I hate?

412
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,086
It's not easy to be
a princess...

413
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,747
but you have a duty.

414
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:12,756
This alliance
will help your people.

415
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,917
You must marry Aella.

416
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,052
I would rather that I were dead.

417
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:18,756
The Vikings! Turn back!

418
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,491
It's the Vikings!

419
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:29,764
Quick, my ladies, inside.

420
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:31,434
Steersman, cut to the wind!

421
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:33,376
Forecastle, men! Forward!

422
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:44,048
Remember,
she's not to be harmed...

423
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:46,386
or she's worthless in trade!

424
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,719
Pull forward the bowline!

425
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,631
Bend your backs.

426
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:57,414
No! No!

427
00:42:57,455 --> 00:42:59,389
Bridget!

428
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:01,652
My lady!

429
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:06,125
My lady! Help!

430
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:07,926
My lady!

431
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:18,902
Help! My lady!

432
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:20,342
Help!

433
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:29,843
Welcome aboard, my lady.

434
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:32,378
Aella will kill you for this.

435
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:33,583
Aella?

436
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:35,751
Be a pity to send you
back to him.

437
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,227
What do you know of Aella?

438
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:42,858
I know he'll pay all
his treasure to get you back.

439
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:45,932
I'll keep you for myself.

440
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:51,168
By Odin, she'd make
a fine Viking queen!

441
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,108
Get away from me!

442
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:56,272
Hey...now, first
a little kiss of welcome.

443
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:58,179
Get away!

444
00:43:59,517 --> 00:44:01,542
Little kiss of welcome.

445
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:02,677
No!

446
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,620
Yes...

447
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,055
Remember,
she's not to be harmed...

448
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,754
or she'll be worthless
in trade!

449
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:12,888
Pretty bird. Pretty feathers.

450
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,160
Build her a nest
so she can hide.

451
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,459
Too many hawks around here!

452
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,398
Make sail!

453
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,169
Make sail!

454
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:05,095
Hail Einar! Hail Einar!

455
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:23,915
Stop rowing.

456
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:37,131
Oars down!

457
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:40,566
Hail, Einar!

458
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:41,730
Hail, Ragnar!

459
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:44,240
I give thanks to Odin
for your safe return.

460
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:45,742
Well, where is she?

461
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,300
Where is who?

462
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:48,834
Who do you think I mean...

463
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,403
your little friend
with the pigtails?

464
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:52,108
Stop shouting.

465
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:55,778
You sound like a moose
giving birth to a hedgehog.

466
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,252
Get this grain ashore.

467
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,415
I want to know why
you missed the wench...

468
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:00,684
you were sent to bring back.

469
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:01,691
I didn't miss her.

470
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,590
Where is she?

471
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:16,371
A little skinny perhaps,
but not bad.

472
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:17,965
Not bad at all.

473
00:48:18,008 --> 00:48:19,873
Restrain yourself, my lord.

474
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,879
If she is dishonored,
she's worthless as a queen...

475
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:25,040
and Aella won't
pay ransom for her.

476
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:26,982
I don't need traitors
to plead my cause.

477
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:29,451
My quarrel's with Aella, lady,
not with you.

478
00:48:29,486 --> 00:48:30,714
We were all agreed
you would be unharmed...

479
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:32,722
while you remained with us.

480
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:34,451
Remember that, Einar.
Leave her alone.

481
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:35,856
I haven't touched her...yet.

482
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:39,124
And you never will.
I'd kill myself first.

483
00:48:39,163 --> 00:48:42,599
She doesn't seem to like you.

484
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,430
She likes me well enough.

485
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,959
I doubt it
from the looks of her.

486
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:48,266
So do I.

487
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:51,639
But the time will come.

488
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:52,869
Never.

489
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:55,609
Never?

490
00:48:57,214 --> 00:49:00,047
You like the scars on my face,
don't you?

491
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:03,178
Sure.

492
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,121
My beauty
stirs her little heart.

493
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:18,463
You have better luck
with falcons.

494
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:20,527
She'll never call you
"Dainty face."

495
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:34,047
Any objections?

496
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:36,712
Of course not, my lord.
He's just a slave.

497
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:38,415
Let's go ashore
and take her along.

498
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:39,922
She stays here.

499
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:44,890
We'll talk about her again...

500
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:48,056
when you're more drunk
or more sober.

501
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:51,556
Olaf!
Anchor the boat on the fjord...

502
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:53,263
and guard her well.

503
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,591
Ah, come.

504
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:27,661
You'll soon forget the wench.

505
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:30,265
She's too skinny, anyhow.

506
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:31,672
She's beautiful.

507
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:34,269
And all the bones
sticking out...

508
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:35,778
why, she's an old crow...

509
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:38,441
with all the feathers
pulled out.

510
00:50:38,482 --> 00:50:41,610
She said she'd kill herself
if I touched her.

511
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:43,415
They all say that.

512
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:45,615
What they really mean is
they'll kill themselves...

513
00:50:45,656 --> 00:50:47,123
if you don't.

514
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:51,617
Maybe, but I never had one
spit on me and bite.

515
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:56,463
They'll bite all the more
nowthat you're Einar One-eye.

516
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,992
I wanted to thank you
for proving me innocent.

517
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,536
Go back to your husband!

518
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:11,911
Come. Drink.

519
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:14,315
No one woman
is worth all this fuss.

520
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:43,272
Well, my lady, as terrible
as this captivity is...

521
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:45,076
at least
we should be thankful...

522
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:47,777
that so far our honor
has been spared.

523
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:48,785
Yes, Bridget.

524
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:51,287
We have that
to be thankful for.

525
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:55,621
Strange howthings never
turn out the way you expect.

526
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:58,787
I always thought Vikings
attacked their women.

527
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:01,525
We've been very lucky.

528
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:04,056
It hasn't been due
entirely to luck, Bridget.

529
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:07,161
He can't help the way he acts.

530
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:08,569
He's a pagan, my lady.

531
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:09,902
He's a mad dog.

532
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,067
Well...

533
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:14,407
if it weren't for
the scars on his face...

534
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:16,072
he'd be rather nice-Iooking.

535
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:18,638
For a Viking, I mean.

536
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:21,276
I don't want to talk about him.

537
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,783
Scratches and bites
won't hold him off forever.

538
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:45,802
What a son!

539
00:52:49,646 --> 00:52:52,274
How about my mother?

540
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:55,808
Tell me,
did my mother fight you?

541
00:52:57,488 --> 00:53:01,049
Did she fight me?

542
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:03,821
I have the scars
of her scratches...

543
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:06,261
and bites all over me.

544
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,595
What a woman.

545
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:14,901
That's how I feel about Morgana.

546
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:17,900
Look at me.

547
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:19,568
Do you think with this face...

548
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,670
I want the kind of wife
who would let me touch her?

549
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:26,171
I want her to fight me
tooth and nail...

550
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:29,276
the first time I take her
and the last.

551
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,918
You are my son...

552
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:39,793
and you'll be
wearing this one day.

553
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,593
Don't forget that.

554
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:43,463
I won't forget.

555
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:55,767
Now, you really want her,
as skinny as she is...

556
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:57,211
I give her to you.

557
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,010
Wait a minute.

558
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:01,347
What do you mean?

559
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:03,512
You mean we won't ransom her?

560
00:54:03,554 --> 00:54:06,421
No! You can have her.

561
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,221
I'll give this little wench
from Wales...

562
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,925
a reason to bite and scratch.

563
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:24,231
I'm Einar!

564
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:26,742
Son of Ragnar!

565
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,905
I'll show her
what forging can be done...

566
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:32,575
when fire fights fire!

567
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:34,413
I'll make her howl...

568
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:37,443
till they hear her in Wales!

569
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:06,546
Morgana!

570
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:08,813
My pretty little bird!

571
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:10,945
Sharpen your claws!

572
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:16,258
I'm Einar!

573
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,663
All right, men!

574
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:24,223
Everybody off!

575
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:27,896
Morgana and I want to be alone.

576
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:29,599
Good job, men!

577
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:37,774
Thank you, Olaf!

578
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:40,348
Morgana!

579
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:42,579
Out! Out!

580
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:44,246
Come on, lady! You!

581
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:46,016
I can't swim!

582
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:57,289
If you touch me,
I'll kill myself.

583
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:02,370
There's a sword to do it with...

584
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:04,966
because I'm going to touch you.

585
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:11,578
Scratch.

586
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:17,785
Come on.

587
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:18,788
Fight.

588
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:20,881
A woman can't fight a man.

589
00:56:20,924 --> 00:56:21,913
You wench!

590
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,755
Kick! Bite! Scratch!

591
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:28,888
Now, come on...

592
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:30,422
fight me.

593
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:36,439
I will not lift one finger
to resist you.

594
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:49,908
Whatever you do
will be on your conscience.

595
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:55,284
Let it be on my conscience.

596
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:07,030
I've come to help you escape.

597
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,061
-Escape?
-I've stolen a ship.

598
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:11,870
My lady, it's only a tiny boat.
We'll drown.

599
00:57:11,908 --> 00:57:14,035
-Are you afraid?
-Yes.

600
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:16,204
-Will you come with me?
-Yes.

601
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:19,272
My lady, how do you know
you can trust this slave?

602
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:20,715
-I know.
-But, my lady!

603
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:22,184
If you don't want to come,
you can stay.

604
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:25,086
Wait. Wait for me.

605
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:02,482
Our only chance
is to get far away by morning.

606
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:04,550
Yes, I can see that.

607
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:09,893
We'd go a lot faster
if we all rowed.

608
00:58:09,932 --> 00:58:12,298
Would we?

609
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:14,963
Yes, we would.

610
00:58:15,004 --> 00:58:17,495
Do you mean
that I should rowthis boat?

611
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,974
Yes, I do mean that.

612
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:23,942
Impossible.

613
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,073
Get an oar and row.

614
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:27,912
But a princess
doesn't row a boat.

615
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,713
Get an oar and row.

616
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:31,276
Well, I can't.

617
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,185
I don't know how.

618
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:41,125
Learn. You, too.

619
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:03,382
What's the matter now?

620
00:59:03,419 --> 00:59:06,388
This bodice is too tight.
I'll have to stop.

621
00:59:06,422 --> 00:59:09,653
-What's a bodice?
-This dress I'm wearing.

622
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,455
It's too tight right in there...

623
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:15,757
Row.

624
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:17,698
Mine isn't too tight.

625
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:12,951
Eric, look.

626
01:00:18,294 --> 01:00:19,352
It's Einar.

627
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:20,987
Turn! Turn!

628
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:09,642
They're heading for the fog.

629
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:11,840
We'll get them.

630
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,778
We can't go into the fog.

631
01:01:15,818 --> 01:01:17,649
Keep rowing.

632
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,833
Faster! Faster!

633
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:12,932
The men are afraid
we'll run aground. So am I.

634
01:02:12,975 --> 01:02:14,374
Keep rowing!

635
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,916
Faster! Faster!

636
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:36,760
Look out!

637
01:02:40,903 --> 01:02:42,996
Grab hold of the mast!

638
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,530
Stop rowing.

639
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:49,806
Odin! Odin!

640
01:02:51,213 --> 01:02:53,204
I'm going under!

641
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:58,478
Hold on!

642
01:02:58,521 --> 01:02:59,886
Get me out!

643
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:07,147
Into the boat!

644
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:12,526
Over here!

645
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:14,620
Over here!

646
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:19,000
Back to your oars!

647
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,127
Back to your oars!

648
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,364
Give up the chase.

649
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,963
Morgana's out there!

650
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,268
After them!

651
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:26,865
The Great Snake is sunk.

652
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:29,707
You want to wreck
this ship, too?

653
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,179
Ragnar.

654
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:38,151
Where's Ragnar?

655
01:04:38,187 --> 01:04:40,451
At the bottom of the fjord.

656
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:48,423
Curse of Odin on that slave!

657
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:54,802
If I have to cross
the Poison Sea...

658
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:56,828
I'll find him.

659
01:04:56,872 --> 01:04:59,432
I swear it.

660
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:02,706
By the sacred blood of Odin.

661
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:34,608
Still afraid?

662
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:38,807
No. I'm worth more alive
than dead. Are you?

663
01:05:38,848 --> 01:05:41,282
No.

664
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:43,683
But I value my life
much more now.

665
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:48,487
Of course I'm grateful
to you for saving me...

666
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:52,324
and Aella
will certainly reward you.

667
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:54,295
Why should I take you
back to Aella?

668
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:57,493
-But you must.
-Why?

669
01:05:57,533 --> 01:06:01,867
I'm pledged to him
on my father's word.

670
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:03,132
I didn't steal you away...

671
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,231
just to give you
to another man.

672
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:09,440
Aella isn't another man.

673
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:11,412
He's a king.

674
01:06:11,447 --> 01:06:13,347
And I'm a slave.

675
01:06:15,317 --> 01:06:17,979
And I loved you
the moment I saw you.

676
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:22,387
I loved you even before then.

677
01:06:24,126 --> 01:06:27,118
Kitala saw it in the runes.

678
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,225
That's just Kitala's silly talk.

679
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,004
Do you love Aella?

680
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:48,581
I belong to him...

681
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:52,246
by my father's word
as a Christian king.

682
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:56,452
What's your father's word
compared to Odin's will?

683
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:02,055
Do you know which of
all the oceans is the widest?

684
01:07:02,097 --> 01:07:04,361
The Poison Sea.

685
01:07:06,669 --> 01:07:08,534
No.

686
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:11,472
The ocean between
a Christian and a heathen.

687
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:17,345
Our hands can reach across it
as easily as that.

688
01:07:17,379 --> 01:07:20,041
But that's just
a joining of the flesh.

689
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:22,550
What else is missing?

690
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:25,213
Joining of our souls.

691
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:28,781
If our hands are touching,
our souls must be touching.

692
01:07:28,824 --> 01:07:32,157
But your soul is heathen.

693
01:07:32,194 --> 01:07:34,162
If my soul is content
to be heathen...

694
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:37,188
and yours content
to be Christian...

695
01:07:37,232 --> 01:07:41,032
let's not question flesh
for wanting to remain flesh.

696
01:08:10,265 --> 01:08:12,631
You'll be in England soon.

697
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,243
Suppose Aella releases you
from your pledge.

698
01:08:30,085 --> 01:08:32,952
Then I'd be free.

699
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,580
But why should he?

700
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,215
I'll find a way.

701
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:42,393
How can I make you understand?

702
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:49,196
What would be the worst thing
for a Viking?

703
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:54,770
To die without
a sword in his hand...

704
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:57,938
and never enter Valhalla.

705
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,948
For me to break
my pledge to Aella...

706
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:01,950
would be as bad as that.

707
01:09:22,705 --> 01:09:24,434
I'll find a way.

708
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:40,050
You captured
Ragnar single-handed?

709
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:42,148
We all owe you our thanks.

710
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:43,783
I don't want your thanks.

711
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:46,294
I want Morgana.

712
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:49,195
This barbarian
is under the illusion...

713
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:51,665
that you desire to be
released from your pledge.

714
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,634
Do you release me?

715
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:56,570
Surely you don't
want to be released.

716
01:09:56,605 --> 01:09:59,574
-Yes, I do.
-That is absurd.

717
01:09:59,608 --> 01:10:01,235
Sire, you gave your word.

718
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:03,938
Of course.
But first things first.

719
01:10:03,979 --> 01:10:06,106
Father Godwin...

720
01:10:06,148 --> 01:10:08,708
take the Princess Morgana
to the chapel...

721
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:11,845
that she may meditate
before making a final decision.

722
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:15,184
Yes, sire.

723
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:28,769
Gentlemen,
let us proceed to the kennels.

724
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:31,773
The royal pets are hungry.

725
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:33,001
Take him.

726
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,478
That stone, my lady...

727
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:15,807
where did you get it?

728
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:17,284
Eric gave it to me.

729
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:18,616
Where did he get it?

730
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:20,952
He said it was tied
around his neck...

731
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:23,685
when the Vikings
captured him as a baby.

732
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:11,196
Since you brought him here,
the pleasure shall be yours.

733
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:14,972
Push him in.

734
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:33,993
I claim the right of a Viking
to die with a sword in my hand.

735
01:12:34,029 --> 01:12:36,520
And I deny you that right.

736
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:41,002
Go ahead. Push him in.

737
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,366
Cut my bonds
and give me the sword.

738
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:48,308
Why should I?

739
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:53,277
Would you deny me the right
to enter Valhalla?

740
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:16,670
What are you doing?!

741
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:33,982
You dare give him that sword?

742
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:58,435
Odin!

743
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:18,357
And Einar is his brother.

744
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,597
Eric has surrendered
his own father to Aella.

745
01:14:21,636 --> 01:14:25,299
Father Godwin,
we must try to stop him.

746
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,672
Yes. Come.

747
01:14:32,147 --> 01:14:35,639
You have dared to defy a king!

748
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:39,552
You shall join Ragnar
in the pit.

749
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:41,351
I want all here
to see the reward...

750
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,482
for such defiance.

751
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:45,049
Your Majesty, I would
ask you to bear in mind...

752
01:14:45,093 --> 01:14:46,560
that I made good your promise...

753
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:49,996
in the name
of Holy Mother Church.

754
01:14:54,636 --> 01:14:57,571
Thank you, Father Godwin.

755
01:14:57,606 --> 01:15:01,064
You are the watchdog
of my fury.

756
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:03,976
But if a common slave
can rob me of a queen...

757
01:15:04,012 --> 01:15:05,104
and slay an enemy...

758
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:07,012
too cunning for
a whole nation to defeat...

759
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:09,677
then the day must come
when he will be...

760
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:12,380
a deadlier foe to England
than Ragnar ever was.

761
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:14,480
With or without
God's sanction...

762
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:18,391
I tell you, as your king,
this cannot be.

763
01:15:18,427 --> 01:15:20,258
Yes, my dear?

764
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:22,593
I will keep my pledge to you.

765
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:24,565
Don't kill him.

766
01:15:31,273 --> 01:15:33,571
In that case...

767
01:15:33,608 --> 01:15:35,132
nothing could
distress me more...

768
01:15:35,177 --> 01:15:37,077
than for you
to think me cruel.

769
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:39,103
Then let him go.

770
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:50,318
Hold out the hand
that has defied me.

771
01:16:21,656 --> 01:16:25,456
Let this serve as a lesson
to all Vikings.

772
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:29,021
Take him to his ship
and cast him adrift.

773
01:16:34,669 --> 01:16:36,694
Why do we wait?

774
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:39,904
Because of a slave...

775
01:16:39,941 --> 01:16:45,208
my father's bones lie now
at the bottom of the fjord.

776
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:48,045
Ragnar was your king...

777
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:53,419
but he had no Viking's burial.

778
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:55,685
I have sworn
by the blood of Odin...

779
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:58,454
to avenge my father's death.

780
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:04,788
Why do we wait?

781
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,097
We must mourn Ragnar.

782
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:10,627
It's revenge Ragnar wants,
not mourning.

783
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:14,938
Every Viking wants to revenge
the death of Ragnar.

784
01:17:14,976 --> 01:17:16,375
Then let's go to England now...

785
01:17:16,411 --> 01:17:17,571
for the girl and the slave.

786
01:17:17,612 --> 01:17:19,603
We don't even know
where they are.

787
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:22,674
Where else would the slave go
but to Aella's castle...

788
01:17:22,717 --> 01:17:24,548
to be rewarded
for his treachery?

789
01:17:24,586 --> 01:17:27,555
Perhaps,
but what chance would we have?

790
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:30,581
Aella's castle is the strongest
in all of England.

791
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,923
I know Aella's castle well.

792
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:34,258
Here are the maps.

793
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:37,129
Einar has studied
every stone and beam.

794
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:39,963
To reach the castle,
we must hug the English coast.

795
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:42,265
They will have days
to prepare for our attack.

796
01:17:45,674 --> 01:17:47,642
We don't hug the coast.

797
01:17:47,676 --> 01:17:49,906
We sail across the open sea.

798
01:17:49,945 --> 01:17:51,879
And if there's fog?

799
01:17:51,913 --> 01:17:54,541
Can't we do what a slave did?

800
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:58,849
The slave used witchcraft.

801
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:03,256
His eyes sawthrough the fog
to the stars.

802
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:06,954
Are you afraid, Bjorn?

803
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:10,863
Do not confuse fear
with caution.

804
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:14,426
Odin has sent no sign.

805
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:18,565
Then you can stay here.

806
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:22,509
But we go to avenge
Ragnar's death!

807
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:25,069
Who sails with me?

808
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:51,502
Not even enough to man one ship.

809
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:29,471
Odin.

810
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:45,919
Odin must have answered me.

811
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:49,758
Where's Morgana?

812
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,789
In Aella's castle.

813
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:54,700
You dare to come back here
just to tell me this?

814
01:19:54,736 --> 01:19:57,398
No. I need you and your men
to take the castle...

815
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,237
and you need me to guide you
across the open sea.

816
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:03,244
Why should you want me
to free Morgana?

817
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:05,405
Because she shall be my wife.

818
01:20:10,518 --> 01:20:13,954
All right, slave...

819
01:20:13,988 --> 01:20:17,116
you live until Morgana's free.

820
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:21,459
Vikings! Vikings!

821
01:20:21,496 --> 01:20:23,691
Odin has sent us a sign!

822
01:20:23,732 --> 01:20:25,222
Kill him! Kill him!

823
01:20:29,637 --> 01:20:31,935
Listen to me!

824
01:20:31,973 --> 01:20:34,942
Make no mistake.

825
01:20:34,976 --> 01:20:37,570
I hate this slave
more than any living man...

826
01:20:37,612 --> 01:20:40,137
but he can guide us to Morgana.

827
01:20:40,181 --> 01:20:42,979
What matters more to you?

828
01:20:43,017 --> 01:20:46,851
A foreign wench
or vengeance for Ragnar?

829
01:20:49,457 --> 01:20:51,186
Because of him...

830
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:54,855
your father lies
at the bottom of the fjord.

831
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:56,659
That's not true!

832
01:20:56,698 --> 01:20:59,064
Ragnar died in England!

833
01:21:05,006 --> 01:21:07,236
In the fog, he swam to my boat.

834
01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:09,470
I took him there.

835
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:18,310
How did Ragnar die?

836
01:21:18,353 --> 01:21:21,686
Aella ordered him bound...

837
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:24,089
and thrown alive
into the wolf pit.

838
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:29,859
Ragnar bound like a sheep
and thrown to wolves?

839
01:21:29,898 --> 01:21:32,128
I cut his bonds.

840
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:35,500
He died fighting
with the sword I gave him.

841
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:38,165
And this was my thanks
from Aella...

842
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:41,471
for letting
Ragnar die like a Viking.

843
01:21:51,986 --> 01:21:55,217
Now you know how Ragnar died.

844
01:21:55,256 --> 01:21:58,521
His eyes can lead us to Aella.

845
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,529
Now...

846
01:22:01,563 --> 01:22:03,929
who sails with me?

847
01:22:03,965 --> 01:22:05,990
I will!

848
01:24:27,308 --> 01:24:28,969
Strange, isn't it?

849
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,739
I was going
to take you to England...

850
01:24:30,778 --> 01:24:33,076
and now you're taking me.

851
01:24:35,049 --> 01:24:39,611
Do you still have that stone
you wear about your neck?

852
01:24:39,654 --> 01:24:41,554
No. It's gone.

853
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:46,282
Just as well.

854
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:49,194
Why?

855
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:52,097
I used to think
it would bring me luck.

856
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:56,536
Now neither of us
will have any use for it.

857
01:30:05,713 --> 01:30:08,546
Arthur, the Vikings!

858
01:30:21,395 --> 01:30:23,386
It's the Vikings!

859
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:39,072
The Vikings!

860
01:33:53,574 --> 01:33:57,977
Egbert, where would Morgana be?

861
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:01,675
The safest place...
the tower chapel.

862
01:35:29,203 --> 01:35:31,194
Odin!

863
01:37:44,371 --> 01:37:45,838
Be assured, sire.

864
01:37:45,873 --> 01:37:48,842
The second drawbridge
is much stronger than the first.

865
01:44:48,495 --> 01:44:51,896
Take your magic elsewhere,
holy man.

866
01:44:52,966 --> 01:44:54,957
The chapel is a sanctuary.

867
01:44:58,338 --> 01:44:59,999
Father Godwin.

868
01:45:25,866 --> 01:45:28,630
Go ahead. Jump.

869
01:45:50,891 --> 01:45:52,950
You will be my queen.

870
01:45:57,163 --> 01:45:59,927
I knew it the first moment
I saw you.

871
01:45:59,966 --> 01:46:02,958
You knew it, too.

872
01:46:03,003 --> 01:46:05,528
You knew it that night
on my ship.

873
01:46:06,673 --> 01:46:07,970
It's not true.

874
01:46:08,008 --> 01:46:10,169
Yes...

875
01:46:11,745 --> 01:46:13,679
it is true.

876
01:46:14,848 --> 01:46:16,509
I don't love you.

877
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:23,353
You must love me
exactly as I love you.

878
01:46:27,527 --> 01:46:30,553
I hate you. It's Eric I love.

879
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:59,448
Where are you taking me?

880
01:46:59,492 --> 01:47:00,959
To see Eric...

881
01:47:00,994 --> 01:47:02,962
for the last time.

882
01:47:02,996 --> 01:47:04,463
Don't kill him.

883
01:47:04,497 --> 01:47:05,794
You can't.

884
01:47:05,832 --> 01:47:07,459
Look at this.

885
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,298
It's from the pommel
of the sword Requiter.

886
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:13,465
It was given to Eric
by his mother, Enid the Queen.

887
01:47:13,506 --> 01:47:17,499
Listen to me!
Ragnar was his father!

888
01:47:17,544 --> 01:47:19,808
Lies won't save him!

889
01:47:19,846 --> 01:47:22,644
It's true. I swear it is!

890
01:47:22,682 --> 01:47:25,344
He is your brother!

891
01:47:27,554 --> 01:47:29,112
Eric!

892
01:47:44,537 --> 01:47:45,936
Look at him...

893
01:47:45,972 --> 01:47:48,304
how he hastens to his death.

894
01:47:48,341 --> 01:47:50,935
He can't wait to die.

895
01:47:56,383 --> 01:48:01,286
If I can't have your love,
I'll take your hate.

896
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:46,215
Why did he hesitate?

897
01:51:39,739 --> 01:51:42,173
Odin!

898
01:51:49,415 --> 01:51:52,077
Prepare a funeral for a Viking.
