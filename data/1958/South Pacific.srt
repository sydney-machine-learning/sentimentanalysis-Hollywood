Lieutenant Cable!

Yes?

3
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,953
The captain wants to know
if you'd like to sit up
in the cockpit with him.

4
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,039
Sure. Thanks.

Nice to meet you, Joe.

Well, take it up!
What's the idea?

13
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,963
It's all right.
I just wanted to show
the lieutenant.

14
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,174
Thanks. I'll take
your word for it.

15
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,970
You gotta do something
to break the monotony,
Lieutenant.

16
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,723
If this war ever
really gets started—
It'll get started.

17

Sure, sure,
it'll get started.

18

Yeah.

19
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,027
You, uh, ever hear of
a French civilian
down where we're going...

20
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,530
named Emile De Becque?

21
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,409
Yeah.

22
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,871
What do you know about him?
Nobody knows much about him.

23
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:21,584
He's rich, got a big
plantation on a hill,
hunts, fishes.

24
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,837
What's he doing out here?

25
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,758
Story goes that he had
to beat it out of France
some 15, 16 years ago.

26
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,470
Nobody seems
to know much why.

27
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,224
How 'bout taking me
on your mission
with you, Lieutenant?

28
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,270
Who says I'm on
any mission?

29
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,608
My mistake?
Your mistake.

30
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,487
Sorry.

31
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,582
Now, here we are.

That's the fleet hospital
where they keep the nurses.

A boar's tooth bracelet.

I'll latch on
to some officer who's
got some imagination,

80

who would like to see that
boar's tooth ceremonial
as much as I would.

Why, you big phony.
We all know why you
wanna go to Bali Ha'i.

85
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,106
Yeah? Why?
Because
the French planters...

86
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,733
put their young women
over there when they heard
the G.I.'s were coming.

That's why.
Just as if they
didn't trust us.

ain't boar's teeth.

00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,742
Huh?

170
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,038
Are you crummy major?

171
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,583
No, I'm even crummier
than that.

172
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,585
I'm a lieutenant.

173
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,755
"Lootellan."

174
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,758
Lootellan.

175
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,516
Hiya, Lootellan.
New on the rock?

176
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,601
Just flew in
on that P.B.Y.

177
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,564
- Where from?
- Little island south of Marie Louise.

178
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,315
Hey, Lootellan.

179
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,997
You sexy man.

180
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,624
[Men Laughing]

181
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,713
Thanks. Uh, you're
looking pretty, uh,
fit yourself.

182
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,466
[All Laughing]
Sexy!

183
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,223
Who's she?
Ah, nobody.

184
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,309
She's Tonkinese.

185
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,398
You got sweetheart?

186
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,692
Take home Chicago
to sexy sweetheart.

187
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:40,238
Oh, no, she's a Philadelphia girl.
I doubt that she'd quite appreciate.

188
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,283
What's that
"Philadelia" girl?

189
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,662
What's that mean?
No sexy?
[All Laughing]

190
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,873
You like,
I give you free.

191
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,626
Free? You never give me
anything free.

192
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,794
You no sexy
like Lootellan.

193
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,840
[All Laughing]

194
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,051
Take.

195
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,346
No, thanks.
Where'd you get that anyway?

196
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,017
Bali Ha'i.

197
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,692
[Female Chorus]
# Bali Ha'i #

There's your officer.
[Whispering]
Leave it to me.

202
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,432
Intriguin' little island,
ain't it, Lieutenant?

203
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,604
Officers can get launches
and go over there.

204
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,069
Bali Ha'i.
What's that mean?

205
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:07,742
Bali Ha'i mean
"I am your special island."

206
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,746
Mean "Here I am."

207
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,375
Bali Ha'i your special
island, Lootellan.

208
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,377

# Bali Ha'i ##

259
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,897
Of course, Lieutenant,
uh, right now,

260
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,734
uh, that island
is off-limits.

261
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,446
Of course,
you being an officer,

262
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,699
you could get a launch.

263
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,742
I'd even be willin'...

264
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,829
to requisition
a boat for you.

265
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,626
[Chuckles]
But another thing
goes on over there.

266
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:14,340
The, uh, ceremonial
of the boar's tooth.

267
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,426
After they kill the boar,

268
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,306
they... pass around
some of that, uh,

269
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,017
coconut liquor.

270
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,937
And women, uh, dance
with just skirts on.

271
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:34,861
And everybody gets
to know everybody
pretty well.

272
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,488
And I thought you bein'
up in the shootin' war...

273
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,992
for such a long time
without getting any recreation,

274
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,246
uh, thought you might
be interested.

275
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,957
[Whooping]
Iron belly.

276
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,336
[Men Whooping]

277
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,088
[Whooping Continues]

278
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,262
Here she is, sir.

279
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,896
You are causing
an economic revolution
on this island.

280
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,858
These French planters
can't find a native
to pick a coconut...

281
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,860
or milk a cow...

282
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,363
because you're paying them
10 times as much...

283
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,908
to make these ridiculous
grass skirts.

284
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,660
French planters
stingy stinker!

285
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,746
Like you,
crummy Captain!

286
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:37,507
I want you to pick up
every scrap of this
paraphernalia now.

287
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,219
And for the last time,
carry it way down there...

288
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,388
beyond that pier...

289
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,724
off navy property.

290
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,947
All right, you men!
Take this stuff down there
past that pier!

291
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,032
Snap to it!

292
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,995
Who is he?
Don't know, sir.

293
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,957
All right, all right.
Come on. Let's go.

294
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,460
Get it down there.
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

295
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:18,840
Way down there.
Off navy property.

296
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,718
You go too.

297
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,263
All right, Lootellan.

298
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,348
Thank you.

299
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,353
Lieutenant?
Who are you anyway?

300
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,149
Lieutenant Joseph Cable, sir.
I just flew in
on that P.B.Y.

301
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,359
A joyride?
No, sir. Orders.

302
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,113
A marine under orders
to me?
Yes, sir.

303
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,657
This is Commander Harbison,
my executive officer.

304
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,285
Commander.
Lieutenant Cable.

305
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,620
Well, what's it
all about?

306
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,789
Well, sir,

307
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,208
my colonel feels...

308
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,294
that all these islands
are in danger...

309
00:29:56,378 --> 00:30:00,548
because none of us
has been getting any
firsthand intelligence.

310
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,009
We don't know
what the Japanese
are really up to.

311
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,052
He couldn't be more right.

312
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,222
He feels that what
we need is a coast watch.
A coast watch?

313
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,476
Yes, sir.
One of our men
with a radio...

314
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,645
hiding out on one
of the enemy-held islands...

315
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,898
where he could watch
for enemy ships...

316
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,902
when they come down
through the bottleneck
down this way.

317
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,821
What do you think,
Bill?

318
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,699
Well, sir, our pilots
could do a lot of damage...

319
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,244
to enemy convoys with
information like that.

320
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,830
How would you get a man
on one of those islands?

321
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,666
Have to sneak him ashore
somehow, sir.

322
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,669
How long do you think
he could hold out there
sending messages...

323
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,755
before the Japanese
spotted him?

324
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,757
It could be done, sir.

325
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,301
Yeah, but who's
going to do it?

326
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,096
Well, sir,
I've been elected.

327
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,308
You got yourself
quite an assignment, son.

328
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,062
I think I'd be okay...

329
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,482
if I could take a man
with me who really
knew the country.

330
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,818
Headquarters has found out
that there's a French
civilian here...

331
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,571
used to have a plantation
on Marie Louise Island.

332
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:08,449
Did a lot of hunting
and fishing there.

333
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,828
Marie Louise.
That's a good spot.
Right on the bottleneck.

334
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,540
What's this
Frenchman's name?
Emile De Becque.

335
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:19,043
Ah! He lives
right up there.

336
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,214
[Cable]
Yes, sir. Do you know him?
Well, I've met him.

337
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,926
But I don't know
very much about him... yet.

338
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,810
Is all this yours?
Yes.

339
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:40,273
[Miss Forbush]
Is it true that all the planters
on these islands—

340
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,984
Are they really running away
from something?

341
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:49,740
Uh, who is not running away

342
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,993
There are fugitives
everywhere.

343
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,412

344
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,081
even in Small Rock.

345
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,166
Yeah, where you come from.

346
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,335
Oh! Little Rock.

Yes.

You know
any fugitives there?

00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,597
I'll show you a picture
of a Little Rock fugitive.

351
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,562
I got this clipping
from my mother... today.

Florence Nightingale."

355
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,617
That was written
by Mrs. Leeming,
the social editor.

356
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,952
Hmm.
She went to school
with my mother.

357
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:38,039
Pretty girl, huh?

358
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:41,459
That picture was taken
before I knew what...

359

Just look
at that yellow sun.

364
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,731
And way off in the distance,
those lovely little
white clouds.

365
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,069
Those lovely little
white clouds could
easily be gunfire.

Perhaps the end
of some worlds.

I wanted to see
what the world was like—
outside of Little Rock, I mean.

But I want to tell you.

518
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,663
I had to leave France.
I killed a man.

519
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,583
Why did you kill him?

520
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:15,045
He was a wicked man—

521
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,255
the town bully.

522
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,258
Everyone in our village
was glad to see him die.

523
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,302
And it was not
to my discredit.

524
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,597
Do you believe me,
Nellie?

525
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,436
You— You just told me
that you killed a man...

526
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,522
and that it's all right.

527
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,693
I hardly know you.

528
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,988
And yet I know
it's all right.

529
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,074
Thank you, Nellie.

530
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,745
And you like my place?

531
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,875
Yes.
You— You will think?

532
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,964
I will think.

533
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,520
Shh.

00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,376

[Brackett]
Oh, come in, Cable.
Come over here.

552
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:52,035
Look at this.
We've got some dope
on your Frenchman.

553
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,538
Had a plantation
on Marie Louise Island.

554
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,916
Moved down here
to this island
16 years ago.

555
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,752
Married to a Polynesian
woman for about five years.

556
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,965
Two children by her.
She died.

557
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,300
Here's one thing
we've got to clear up.

558
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,761
Seems he left France
in a hurry.

559
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:14,349
Killed a guy.
What do you think of that?

560
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:18,436
Might be a handy man
to have around.
[Intercom Buzzes]

562
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,482
Good. Send her in.

563
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:26,111
Here she is.
Oh, come in, Miss Forbush.

564
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,866
Captain Brackett,
please excuse the way I look.

565
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,952
I was just—
Oh, you look fine.

566
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,663
May I present
Commander Harbison?

567
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,833
I have the pleasure
of meeting Miss Forbush
twice a week.

568
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,213
We serve together
on the G.I.
entertainment committee.

569
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,466
Oh.
How's the Thanksgiving
entertainment coming along?

570
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,429
Very well. Thank you, sir.
We practice whenever
we get a chance.

571
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:57,100
May I also present
Lieutenant Joseph Cable?
Miss Forbush.

572
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,686
Sit down, Miss Forbush.

573
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,072
Miss Forbush, you've been
seeing a French planter,
Emile De Becque.

574
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,284
Yes, sir.

575
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,037
Good. What do you know
about him?

576
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,460
Well, uh, uh,
what do I know about him?

577
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,004
That's right.

578
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,341
Well, I, uh—

579
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,971
We met at
the Officers Club dance.

580
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:38,892
He was there.
And I met him.

581
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,728
Yes. Now, what kind
of a man is he?

582
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,649
Well, uh,

583
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,027
he's very nice.

584
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,405
He's kind.

585
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,659
He's attractive.

586
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,331
I just don't know
what you wanna know, sir.

587
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:05,043
Miss Forbush,
Captain Brackett
wants to know,

588
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,045
did you discuss
politics?

589
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,797
No, sir.

590
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,885
Would you have discussed
politics, Commander?

591
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,098
What we're specifically
interested in is—

592
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,394
well, when these fellas come
out from France, it's generally
because they've had trouble.

593
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,479
Has he ever told you
anything about that?

594
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,241
Well, uh, what do you know
about his family, for instance?

595
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,160
Oh, uh, he has no family.

596
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,621
No wife. Nobody.

597
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,543
- He doesn't have any children?
- No, sir.

598
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:50,130
And you say
he's never told you
why he left France?

599
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,884
Yes, sir.

600
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,137
He left France
because he killed a man.

601
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,725
Did he tell you why?

602
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,061
No, but he will
if I ask him.

603
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:08,231
Well, Miss Forbush,
that's exactly what
we'd like to have you do.

604
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,317
Find out as much
about him as you can—

605
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:15,655
his background, his opinions
and why he killed
this man in France.

606
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,950
In other words,
you want me to spy on him?

607
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,079
Well, I'm afraid it is
something like that.

608
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:26,082
Why? Do you suspect
him of anything?

609
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,919
No. It's just
that we don't know
very much about him.

610
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,506
And he's— Will you
help us, Miss Forbush?

611
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,260
I'll try.

612
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,847
Thank you. You may
go now if you wish.

613
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,932
Thank you.

614
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:52,192
I don't know very much
about him, really.

615
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,277
Do I?

616
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,791
He's kept a few secrets
from her, hasn't he?

617
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:12,545
Well, you don't spring a couple
of Polynesian kids on a woman
right off the bat.

618
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,507
I'm afraid
we aren't gonna get
much out of her.

619
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,801
She's obviously
in love with him.

620
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:22,347
That's hard to believe, sir.
They tell me he's
a middle-aged man.

621
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,099
Cable,

622
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,978
it is a common mistake
for boys of your age...

623
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,064
and athletic ability...

624
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,692
to underestimate men
who have reached
their maturity.

625
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:39,906
Sir, I didn't mean—
Young women frequently find
a grown man attractive,

626
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,659
strange as it
may seem to you.

627
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,830
I, myself, am over 50.
I am a bachelor.

628
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,583
And, Cable,
I do not by any means...

629
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,754
consider myself... through.

630
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,006
[Chuckles]

631
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,050
What's the matter, Bill?

632
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,637
Nothing, evidently.
[Laughing]

633
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:06,015
Okay, Cable,
see you at chow.
Yes, sir.

634
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,437
Anything
for Ensign Forbush?

635
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:16,359
Oh, uh, your mail,
Miss Forbush.
Oh, thanks, Luther.

636
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,320
And, uh, your hot water's
still waiting for ya.

637
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:22,115
Oh, thank you, Luther.
You're sweet.

638
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:33,626
Don't change your expression,
Lieutenant. Just act like
we're talkin' casual.

639
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,045
I got the boat.
What boat?

640
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,132
We're shoving off
for Bali Ha'i
in 45 minutes.

641
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:43,595
What are you talking about?
The project you and I got
to go to Bali Ha'i.

642
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,556
Oh, yeah.
Well, you can forget it.

643
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,934
Lieutenant, what
are you doing to me?

644
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,520
I signed this boat out
in your name.

645
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,693
Well, then you're just
the man to cancel it.

646
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,987
Forget the whole thing.

647
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,072
Okay, mate?

648
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:12,498
Lieutenant, you and me
are going on a boat trip...

649
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,792
whether you like it
or not.

650
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,755
Letter from home?

651
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,758
Oh, yes.

652
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,887
Do you get letters
from your mother telling you
that everything you do is wrong?

653
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,599
No. My mother thinks
everything I do is right.

654
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,310
Of course, I don't tell her
everything I do.

655
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,731
My mother is so prejudiced.
Against Frenchmen?

656
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,609
Against anyone living
outside of Little Rock.

657
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,237
She makes a big thing
out of two people having
different backgrounds.

658
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,615
You mean ages?
Oh, no.

659
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,118
Mother says older men
are better for girls
than younger men.

660
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,913
This has been
a discouraging day for me.

661
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,167
Suppose you had a sister
and she was in love...

662
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,336
with a man like—

663
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,838
De Becque?
Yeah.

664
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,386
I'd tell her to lay off.

665
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,356
You don't have to worry
about me anymore
because it's all off.

666
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,400
[Woman]
With him?
Uh-huh.

667
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:25,321
- Smart girl, Nellie.
- I'm gonna break it off clean
before it's too late.

668
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:30,159
Do you think you can?
Before I go any further,
I just better not get started.

669
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:34,539
Don't you think
so too, Gracey?
Yes, I do.

670
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,961
You do, huh?
Yes.

671
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,130
Well, I guess I do too.

672
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,395
Well, you don't have to
look so dramatic about it.

673
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,439
Things like this
happen every day.

674
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,741
# I'm gonna wash that man
right outa my hair, #

675
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,577

676

# I'm gonna wash that man
right outa my hair, #

677
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,917
# And send him on his way. #
Get the picture?

678
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,795
# I'm gonna wave that man

don't understand you, #

# Rub him outa

00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,239

[All]

689
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,620
# Oh ho! #

[Trills]
Hyah!

696
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,547
Oh, hello.

697
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,632
Hello.

698
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,137
Uh, that song—

699
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,974
is it a new
American song?

700
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,227
Well, uh, uh,
it's an American-type song.

701
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:05,481
We were just kind of, uh,
putting in our own words,
you know.

702
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,776
Uh, uh,
where is everybody?

703
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,949
I left a note for you
at the hospital.

704
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:20,830
It was to ask you to my home
for dinner next Friday.

705
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,041
Oh, uh—

706
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,586
Well, Emile, I don't think
I'll be able to come.

707
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:30,298
I have these rehearsals—
I have already invited
some of my friends.

708
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,842
The planters' colony.

709
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,345
Oh. Oh, a big party.

710
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,182
Well— Well,
then if I can't come,
you won't miss me.

711
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,851
But it is for you.

712
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,479
It is for my friends
to meet you...

713
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,565
and, more important,
for you to meet them.

714
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:52,570
To give you an idea
of what your life
would be like here.

715
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,655
I want you to know
more about me—

716
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,159
how I live and think.

717
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,161
More about you.

718
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,789
Yes. You know
very little about me.

719
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,627
That's right.

720
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,129
Uh, would you sit down?

721
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,435
Do you think about
politics much?

722
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,606
And if so, what do you
think about politics?

723
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,487
I've—
Do you mean that—

724
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,698
Do you mean
my political philosophy?

725
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,493
I think that's what I mean.

726
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,371
Oh.
[Chuckles]

727
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,456
Uh, well,

728
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,461
to begin with, I—

729
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:55,007
I believe in
the free life and
freedom for everyone.

730
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,885
Like in the Declaration
of Independence?

731
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,887
C'est ça.

732
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:03,557
All men are created
equal, isn't it?

733
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,643
Emile, you really
believe that?

734
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,355
But of course, Nellie.

735
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,487
Well, thank goodness.

736
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,282
Oh.
It's why I am here,

737
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,578
why I killed a man.

738
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,127
Oh, yes, I, uh—

739
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:35,589
[Clears Throat]
I meant to ask you
about that too.

740
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:40,136
Now, uh, I don't want you
to think I'm prying
into your private life...

741
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,763
asking a lot of personal
questions, but, uh,

742
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:46,642
I always think
it's interesting...

743
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:50,313
why a person... kills...

744
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,398
another person.

745
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,402
But of course, Nellie.

746
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,073
That has worried you.

747
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:14,253
When I was a boy,
I carried my hat
in my hand.

748
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:18,090
So, when this man
came to our town,

749
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,843
though my father
said he was good,

750
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,679
I thought he was bad.

751
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:25,765
I was young.

752
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:31,395
He attracted all the mean
and cruel people to him.

753
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,564
Soon he was running
our town.

754
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,859
He could do anything,
take anything.

755
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,111
I didn't like that.

756
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,907
I was young.

757
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,618
I stood up
in the public square.
I made a speech.

758
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,705
I called upon everyone
to stand with me
against this man.

759
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,626
- What did they do?
- They walked away.

760
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,506
- Why?
- Because they saw him
standing behind me.

761
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:03,052
I turned.

762
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:07,473
And he said to me,
"I'm going to kill you now."

763
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,310
We fought.

764
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,814
I was never so strong.

765
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,818
I knocked him
to the ground.

766
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,907
And when he fell,
his head struck a stone and—

767
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:35,751
I ran to the waterfront
and joined a cargo boat.

768
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,754
I didn't even know
where it was going.

769
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:45,010
I stepped off that boat
into another world...

770
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,681
where I am now,

771
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,225
and where I want to stay.

772
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,481
Nellie, will you
marry me?

773
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:10,494
There are so few days
in our life, Nellie.

774
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:13,247
The time I have
with you now...

775
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,332
is precious to me.

776
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,751
Have you been thinking?

777
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,044
Have you been thinking?

778
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,256
I've been thinking.

779
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,302
# Born on the opposite
sides of a sea, #

780
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,972
# We are as different
as people can be. #

781
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,850
# It's true #

782
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:38,147
# And yet you want
to marry me. #

783
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,734
# I do. #

784
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:45,946
# I've known you a few
short weeks #

785
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:51,869
# And yet somehow you've made
my heart forget #

786
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:56,749
# All other men
I have ever met #

787
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,544
# but you, #

788
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:05,257
# but you. #

789
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,469
# Who can explain it? #

790
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,180
# Who can tell you why? #

791
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,518
# Fools give you reasons, #

792
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:24,568
# Wise men never try. ##

793
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,667
Will you come
next Friday?

794
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,752
Uh-huh.

795
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,422
[Women Laughing]

796
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:09,196
[Woman]
Well, she sure washed him
out of her hair.

797
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,658
- [Woman #2]
She sure did.
- [Women Laughing]

798
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,831
# I expect ev'ry one
of my crowd. #

799
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:23,377
# To make fun of my proud
protestations of faith
and romance #

800
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:32,761
# And they'll say
I'm naïve as a babe
to believe #

# Any fable I hear
form a person in pants #

802
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,274
# Fearlessly
I'll face them #

803
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,737
# and argue
their doubts away #

804

# Loudly I'll sing
about flowers and spring #

805

# Flatly I'll stand on
my little flat feet and say #

806
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,211
# Love is a grand #

807
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:11,175
# and a beautiful thing. #

808
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:17,890
# I'm not ashamed

809
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:22,686

# I'm as corny

# I'm in love

835
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,617
Now, before you give us
an answer,

836
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,411
I wanna impress you
with three things.

837
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,582
First— you are a civilian
and you don't have to go.

838
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,419
Second— this is
a very dangerous mission...

839
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:55,172
and there's no guarantee
that you will survive...

840
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,383
or that it will do
any good.

841
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,725
Third— that it might
do a great good.

842
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,229
It might be the means
of turning the tide
of the war in this area.

843
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,565
Yeah, I understand
all these things.

844
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,193
Are you ready to give us
your answer?

845
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,278
Yes, I am.

846
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,949
My answer must be no.

847
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,334
When a man faces death,

848
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,087
he must weigh values
very carefully.

849
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:40,050
He must weigh
the sweetness of his life...

850
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,387
against the thing
he's asked to die for.

851
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,226
The probability of death
is very great...

852
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,311
for both of us.

853
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:58,151
I know that island well,
Lieutenant Cable.

854
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:05,993
And, uh, I'm not certain

stay for just a moment.
You know I can't stay.

this jeep back.
I stole it.

You must never return
anything you steal.
Then they'll know you stole it.

01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:24,071

Or rather someone
stole it for me.

I have to sneak around
behind the hospital as it is.

I forbid you to go.

without anyone seeing you,

sneak back later.

I don't want to pry
into your affairs, but...

1282
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:16,651
whatever is bothering you
is some personal thing,
of course.

1283
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:20,905
But I wonder
if you realize just
how unimportant it is.

1284
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:25,660

Yes.

1285
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:28,955

at this particular time.

Miss Forbush,
up to now, in this war,

a merciless beating
in two hemispheres,

that— that I
consider you...

1398
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:23,202
even including the fact
that you're an officer.

1399
01:57:23,286 --> 01:57:25,913
And— And I just can't
go on being such a heel...

1400
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:29,166

I thought of giving you
those flowers.

Oh, but you did
give them to me, and—
No.

I lie in the loneliness
of evening,

1404
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:55,901
looking out
on a silver-flaked sea,

1405
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:58,487
and ask the moon,

1406
01:57:58,572 --> 01:58:00,489
"Oh, how soon—

1407
01:58:00,574 --> 01:58:04,034

Nellie the Nurse?

01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,592

01:58:22,262 --> 01:58:25,222
Joe, who let you out
of the hospital?
Me! I'm okay. Come on.

1414
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:28,267
Nellie?
Are you ready?
Oh, Bill—

1415
01:58:28,393 --> 01:58:31,562
Bill, would you wait
just a minute, please?
Sure.

1416
01:58:37,736 --> 01:58:40,070
You're trying to get over
to Bali Ha'i.

That little girl
you told me about.

I've got to.

1419
01:58:52,501 --> 01:58:55,878
All the time
I've been in the hospital
with that darn malaria,

1420
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:00,049
I haven't been able
to see anything
but her face.

1421
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:04,595
I love her, and—

1422
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:08,933
What kind of a guy
am I anyway?

1423
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:14,146
I love her,
and yet I said I couldn't
marry her, and—

1424
01:59:14,231 --> 01:59:16,232
I don't understand myself.

1425
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:21,070
If I love her,
why don't I marry her...

1426
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:23,155
and stay here and—

1427
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:26,992
You're just far away
from home, Joe.

1428
01:59:28,245 --> 01:59:30,663
We're both far away
from home.

1429

But it doesn't
make sense!

1430
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:35,584
Oh, yes, it does.

1431
01:59:37,838 --> 01:59:40,297
I guess it does anyway.

I guess
people like us—

1433
01:59:43,593 --> 01:59:47,012
well, we just have to
go back to where we belong.

Emile, I—
Will you excuse us,
Lieutenant Cable?

1461
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:37,081
No, Joe! Stay.
Stay, please.

1462
02:01:40,919 --> 02:01:43,420
I've been meaning
to call you, Emile.

1463
02:01:43,505 --> 02:01:47,466
You have asked
for a transfer. Why?

1464
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:50,219
What does it mean,
Nellie?

1465
02:01:50,303 --> 02:01:53,347
I— I'll— I'll explain it
to you tomorrow, Emile.

1466
02:01:53,431 --> 02:01:57,142
No. Now.
What does it mean, Nellie?

1467
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:02,690
It means that I
can't marry you.

1468
02:02:02,774 --> 02:02:04,733
Do you understand?

1469
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:08,278
I— I can't marry you.

1470
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:12,825
- Because of my children.
- Oh, not because
of your children.

1471
02:02:12,909 --> 02:02:14,827
They're sweet.

1472
02:02:14,911 --> 02:02:18,163
It is their Polynesian
mother then—

1473
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:20,249
their mother and I.

1474
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:27,089
Yes.

1475
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:29,174
I can't help it.

1476
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:34,847
I-It isn't as if I could
give you a good reason.

1477
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:37,975
I—
There is no reason.

1478
02:02:39,686 --> 02:02:41,687
This is emotional.

1479
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:47,484
This is something
that's born in me.

1480
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:49,486
It is not.

1481
02:02:49,571 --> 02:02:52,239
I do not believe
this is born in you.

1482
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:56,493
Well, then why— why do I
feel the way I do?

1483
02:02:56,578 --> 02:03:00,122
All I— All I know is,
I— I can't help it.

1484
02:03:00,206 --> 02:03:03,125
I— I can't help it.

1485
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:06,628

how we feel.

1486
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:08,630

Bill?

1489
02:03:17,098 --> 02:03:19,266
Can we go now?
Please?

1490
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,703
What makes her
talk like that?

1491
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:43,582
Why do you have
this feeling—
you and she?

1492
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:46,752
I do not believe
it is born in you!

1493
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:48,796
I do not believe it!

1494
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:52,091
It's not born in you!

1495
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:54,676

Yes, sir.

of this thing alive,
I'm not going back there.

02:06:00,136 --> 02:06:02,471
I came so close to it.

1530
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:07,851
So close.

1531
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:21,573
# One dream
in my heart #

1532
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:27,287
# One love
to be living for #

1533
02:06:27,372 --> 02:06:32,709
# One love
to be living for #

1534
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:37,589
# This nearly was mine. #

1535
02:06:37,674 --> 02:06:40,467
# One girl #

1536
02:06:40,551 --> 02:06:43,679
# for my dream #

1537
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:49,309
# One partner
in paradise #

1538
02:06:49,394 --> 02:06:55,857
# This promise
of paradise #

1539
02:06:55,942 --> 02:07:00,946
# This nearly was mine. #

1540
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:06,493
# Close to my heart she came #

1541
02:07:06,577 --> 02:07:12,165
# Only to fly away #

1542
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:15,127
# Only to fly #

1543
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:18,547
# as day flies #

1544
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:28,223
# from moonlight #

1545
02:07:30,059 --> 02:07:36,481
# Now, now I'm alone #

1546
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:42,654
# Still dreaming of paradise, #

1547
02:07:42,739 --> 02:07:45,324
# Still saying #

1548
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:50,495
# that paradise #

1549
02:07:53,082 --> 02:07:58,712
# Once nearly #

1550
02:07:58,796 --> 02:08:07,596
# was mine. ##

1551
02:08:30,411 --> 02:08:32,537
You know,

1552
02:08:32,622 --> 02:08:36,291
back home,
whenever I got in a jam,

1553
02:08:36,376 --> 02:08:39,002
I used to go hunting.

1554
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:42,881
That's what I think
I'll do now.

1555
02:08:44,801 --> 02:08:47,969
Good hunting up there
around Marie Louise.

1556
02:08:50,306 --> 02:08:52,265
Carriers.

1557
02:08:53,434 --> 02:08:55,727
Cargo boats.

1558
02:08:55,812 --> 02:08:57,813
Troop ships.

1559
02:08:59,524 --> 02:09:01,483
Big game.

1560
02:09:07,865 --> 02:09:09,825
De Becque.

1561
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:14,496
Would you
reconsider...

1562
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:17,249
going up there with me
to Marie Louise Island?

1563
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:24,381
I mean, now that
you haven't got
so much to lose?

1564
02:09:27,885 --> 02:09:30,720
We could do a good job,
I think.

1565
02:09:32,306 --> 02:09:34,224
You and I.

1566
02:09:44,902 --> 02:09:47,654
How could a P.B.Y land
anywhere near that island...

1567
02:09:47,738 --> 02:09:50,115
without being seen
by the enemy?

1568
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:52,868
It will not land
near the island,

1569
02:09:52,952 --> 02:09:54,953
but far out at sea.

1570
02:09:56,539 --> 02:10:00,792
I know the fishing grounds
my friends use,

1571
02:10:00,877 --> 02:10:03,712
and I know
two fishermen there—

1572
02:10:03,796 --> 02:10:06,298
Inato and Basil.

1573
02:10:06,382 --> 02:10:08,383
They will help us.

1574
02:10:12,263 --> 02:10:16,266
The equipment's
all aboard, sir. We loaded it
while it was still dark.

1575
02:10:18,102 --> 02:10:21,146
You'd better wait
a while yet
before you take off.

1576
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:24,858
Above all, this must look
like a casual, routine flight.

1577
02:10:30,406 --> 02:10:34,117
Well, there's still
plenty of time
to change your mind.

1578
02:10:47,256 --> 02:10:49,633
Hey, Buzz!
Captain?

1579
02:10:51,427 --> 02:10:54,638
Yeah?
Are you we gonna need
the parachutes or not?

1580
02:10:54,722 --> 02:10:57,307
No, it looks calm enough
for us to set down.

1581
02:10:57,433 --> 02:11:00,769
No parachutes!
[Emile]
All right.

1582
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:08,902
[Cable]
Looks like a summer day
in Maine.

1583
02:11:08,986 --> 02:11:11,404
That's a state
in America.

1584
02:11:11,489 --> 02:11:13,823
Yeah.
Lobsters.

1585
02:11:13,908 --> 02:11:16,201
Lobsters.

1586
02:11:16,285 --> 02:11:18,828
Hey, you guys
better start getting
into that gear!

1587
02:11:18,913 --> 02:11:21,081
Hey, we're approaching
Marie Louise.

1588
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:28,129
[Explosions Continue]

1589
02:11:35,346 --> 02:11:40,559
- [Loud Explosion]
- What's going on here?

1590
02:11:40,643 --> 02:11:42,852
What? Roger.

1591
02:11:45,147 --> 02:11:48,525
Hey, we got it
in the tail section.
I'll go take a look.

1592
02:11:48,651 --> 02:11:51,444
[Explosions Continue]
Well, say something!

1593
02:11:51,529 --> 02:11:54,322
Who's driving
this airplane anyhow?

1594
02:11:57,159 --> 02:12:00,453
I hope you realize
there's a hole
in this plane!

1595
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:03,373
Oh, hello,
Lieutenant, everybody.

1596
02:12:03,457 --> 02:12:05,417
It's Luther.

1597
02:12:05,501 --> 02:12:08,962
What are you doing
on this plane? How'd you
get on here anyway?

1598
02:12:09,046 --> 02:12:11,548
Well, I— I thought
maybe you might need
an extra man.

1599
02:12:11,632 --> 02:12:13,925
Seemed like
an interesting project,
and I—

1600
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:16,511
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
You feeling sick or something?

1601
02:12:16,596 --> 02:12:18,763
If you don't like the idea,
we'll just forget it.

1602
02:12:18,848 --> 02:12:21,433
I'll go back
to the baggage compartment.
Just pretend you never saw me.

1603
02:12:21,517 --> 02:12:24,019
- I'll kill him.
- Now, Lieutenant.

1604
02:12:24,103 --> 02:12:28,023
If I thought you were gonna
take this attitude, I wouldn't
have volunteered my services.

1605
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:30,108
How do you like
this character?

1606
02:12:30,192 --> 02:12:33,069
I'm gonna have you
court-martialed for this,
Billis!

1607
02:12:33,195 --> 02:12:35,822
You better take it easy!
I'm gonna ride you
out of the navy!

1608
02:12:35,906 --> 02:12:38,908
Do you realize that
this is a secret mission
of the utmost importance?

1609
02:12:38,993 --> 02:12:42,037
I realize this is a secret
mission, and I'm gonna keep
the mission. I'm gonna—

1610
02:12:42,163 --> 02:12:44,998
[Explosion]
[Screaming]

1611
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:49,461
Pull the handle!
Pull the handle!

1612
02:12:49,545 --> 02:12:52,088
Which one?

1613
02:12:52,173 --> 02:12:54,090
Hey, Captain!
Man overboard!

1614
02:12:54,216 --> 02:12:57,344
Boy, that Cable
plays it rough.
His parachute's opening.

1615
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:03,391
Secret mission, huh?

1616
02:13:04,435 --> 02:13:07,771
Well, it's no secret now.

1617
02:13:07,855 --> 02:13:12,067
Hello. This is
Beer Bus to Brewery,
Beer Bus to Brewery.

1618
02:13:12,151 --> 02:13:15,779
Yeah, look. Say, look,
I got a man parachuting down
into the Empress Augusta Bay.

1619
02:13:15,863 --> 02:13:18,948
That's right.
You guys are gonna have to
help me 'cause I can't.

1620
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:20,992
Right.
Roger and out.

1621
02:13:21,077 --> 02:13:24,579
So, it's gonna be
one of those days, huh?

1622
02:13:24,664 --> 02:13:26,581
Okay.

1623
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,929
Hey, hey, hey! Wait!
Don't leave me!

1624
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:46,601
Look, drop a boat
back there, will you?

1625
02:14:06,956 --> 02:14:09,165
[Screams]

1626
02:14:26,142 --> 02:14:29,519
[Machine Gun Fire Continues]

1627
02:14:42,199 --> 02:14:45,076
Can't you get him out of there?
He'll be shot to pieces!

1628
02:14:45,161 --> 02:14:47,412
I can't. I gotta get
you guys in first.

1629
02:14:47,496 --> 02:14:50,415
After that, I'll come back
and pick up the pieces,
if there are any.

1630
02:14:50,499 --> 02:14:52,125
Okay. Let's go.

1631
02:15:18,861 --> 02:15:21,946
Looks like he's an American,
and they're shootin' at him.

1632
02:15:22,031 --> 02:15:24,657
Well, let's make 'em
shoot at us.

1633
02:15:45,721 --> 02:15:48,556
Hey! That's it, boys! Go!

1634
02:15:53,437 --> 02:15:57,315
Hey! That's it! Hey!

1635
02:15:57,399 --> 02:15:59,359
He must be down
about there.

1636
02:15:59,443 --> 02:16:02,779
Well, get him out of there.
Use anything you need.

1637
02:16:02,863 --> 02:16:05,156
We'll send in a destroyer,
if necessary.

1638
02:16:05,241 --> 02:16:07,367
Aye, aye, sir.
The admiral says
go all out.

1639
02:16:22,508 --> 02:16:24,509
Do you see
any fishing boats?

1640
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:39,566
Ah!
Yeah, there we are.

1641
02:16:43,612 --> 02:16:46,447
That's the fishing grounds.

1642
02:16:49,952 --> 02:16:53,371
- Can you go lower here?
- Roger.

1643
02:16:53,455 --> 02:16:56,708
Hey!
That's Inato's boat!

1644
02:16:56,792 --> 02:17:00,503
Basil! Inato!

1645
02:17:00,588 --> 02:17:03,089
Inato!

1646
02:17:06,844 --> 02:17:09,888
All right.
Can we set down here?

1647
02:17:09,972 --> 02:17:14,309
De Becque,
I can set down
anywhere.

1648
02:17:15,895 --> 02:17:17,896
I'll take it.

1649
02:17:19,148 --> 02:17:21,900
This is a black day
for the navy!

1650
02:17:21,984 --> 02:17:26,321
A black, black day!
How much did you say
this cost, Bill?

1651
02:17:26,405 --> 02:17:29,198
It's estimated
at $600,000, sir.

1652
02:17:29,283 --> 02:17:31,200
Did you hear that?

1653
02:17:31,285 --> 02:17:34,203
That's what your
little stunt today
cost the taxpayers!

1654
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:38,458
Six hundred—
$600,000?

1655
02:17:39,585 --> 02:17:41,586
What are you
grinning about?

1656
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:44,130
I was just thinking
about my uncle.

1657
02:17:44,214 --> 02:17:46,382
Remember my uncle
I was telling you about?

1658
02:17:46,467 --> 02:17:50,386
He used to tell my old man
I'd never be worth a dime.

1659
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:52,388
Excuse me, sir.

1660
02:17:52,473 --> 02:17:56,726
Billis, you've been
striking for the brig
ever since you hit this island,

1661
02:17:56,810 --> 02:17:58,770
and today
you finally made it...

1662
02:17:58,854 --> 02:18:02,023
because Captain Brackett and I
are gonna throw the book at you!

1663
02:18:02,107 --> 02:18:05,109
Sir, may I barge in?

1664
02:18:05,194 --> 02:18:08,947
My copilot and I, sir-
we've been sort of kicking
this thing around,

1665
02:18:09,031 --> 02:18:11,491
and, well, we feel that Lu—
well, Billis here—

1666
02:18:11,575 --> 02:18:14,577
down in that rubber boat
with all the airplanes
buzzing around him...

1667
02:18:14,662 --> 02:18:16,663
caused sort of
a diversionary action.

1668
02:18:16,747 --> 02:18:20,291
It made it a lot easier for us
to land Cable and the Frenchman
without being seen.

1669
02:18:20,376 --> 02:18:23,169
In fact, it turned out
to be an awful lucky break
for us, sir.

1670
02:18:23,253 --> 02:18:26,089
What do you want me to do,
give this guy
a gold medal?

1671
02:18:27,549 --> 02:18:29,759
[Sighs]

1672
02:18:29,843 --> 02:18:32,971
I don't want
no gold medal, Captain,

1673
02:18:33,055 --> 02:18:37,392
but, uh, I could use
a little more, um, freedom,

1674
02:18:37,476 --> 02:18:39,477
a little room
to swing around in,

1675
02:18:39,561 --> 02:18:41,980
if you know what I mean,
if you get the picture.

1676
02:18:42,064 --> 02:18:45,775
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

1677
02:18:48,237 --> 02:18:50,697
Get the hell
out of here!

1678
02:18:52,074 --> 02:18:55,076
[Emile On Radio]
Come in, Kennel.
Captain! Captain!

1679
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:57,120
Kennel, come in.

1680
02:18:57,204 --> 02:19:00,164
This is
the Frenchman.
Do you hear me?

1681
02:19:00,249 --> 02:19:02,291
This is Kennel.
Go ahead, Frenchman.

1682
02:19:02,376 --> 02:19:04,794
This is our first chance
to send news to you.

1683
02:19:04,878 --> 02:19:07,338
We have made contact
with former friends
of mine.

1684
02:19:07,423 --> 02:19:11,843
We have set up quarters
in a very nice hole in a rock.

1685
02:19:11,927 --> 02:19:15,346
No room,
but a lovely view.

1686
02:19:15,431 --> 02:19:18,016
We can see right down
into the bottleneck.

1687
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,018
First the weather.

1688
02:19:20,102 --> 02:19:22,437
Rain clouds
over Bougainville,
the Treasuries,

1689
02:19:22,521 --> 02:19:24,981
Choiseul,
New Georgia.

1690
02:19:25,065 --> 02:19:28,693
We expect rain
in this region
from 9:00 to 2:00.

1691
02:19:28,777 --> 02:19:30,987
[Cable]
0900 to 1400.

1692
02:19:31,071 --> 02:19:33,448
Oh, my friend Joe
corrects me.

1693
02:19:33,532 --> 02:19:36,367
0900 to 1400.

1694
02:19:38,203 --> 02:19:41,664
You must not expect from us
any regular communication.

1695
02:19:41,749 --> 02:19:44,876
There are hundreds
of Japanese
in this region.

1696
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:47,920
It will be necessary
to constantly change
our quarters.

1697
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:50,506
And now, our
military expert Joe.

1698
02:19:50,591 --> 02:19:54,052
[Cable]
All you navy, marine
and army pilots,

1699
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:56,888
write this down.

1700
02:19:56,972 --> 02:20:00,683
Surface craft—
19 troop barges...

1701
02:20:00,768 --> 02:20:04,562
headed down
the bottleneck,
speed about 11 knots.

1702
02:20:04,646 --> 02:20:07,607
Ought to pass Banika...

1703
02:20:07,691 --> 02:20:10,610
at about 2000 tonight,

1704
02:20:10,694 --> 02:20:12,737
escorted by
heavy warships.

1705
02:20:12,821 --> 02:20:14,739
As for aircraft,

1706
02:20:14,823 --> 02:20:16,783
22 bombers, Betties—

1707
02:20:16,909 --> 02:20:20,870
A bottle of beer says
I get the first strike!
went by at 0600,

1708
02:20:20,954 --> 02:20:24,165
[Cheering]
headed south southwest.

1709
02:20:24,291 --> 02:20:27,126
About time!
[Cable] There ought to be some
way to knock off a few of those.

1710
02:20:27,211 --> 02:20:30,922
- Hey, wait for us!
- That's all for now.
Good luck.

1711
02:20:57,157 --> 02:21:01,577
Two weeks?
Well, how can those guys
stick it out for two weeks?

1712
02:21:01,662 --> 02:21:05,998
Yeah. Everybody thought
they'd be dead pigeons
in a couple of days.

1713
02:21:07,918 --> 02:21:10,753
I tell you,
those two guys are doing us
a lot of good.

1714
02:21:10,838 --> 02:21:13,631
That Frenchman
reported 40 bombers
north of Munda.

1715
02:21:13,715 --> 02:21:16,717
We took off,
and 40 bombers right
on the nose— boom, boom.

1716
02:21:16,802 --> 02:21:19,637
How do those guys
keep alive up there?
The enemy's all around.

1717
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:21,639
How do they do it?

1718
02:21:21,723 --> 02:21:24,934
That Frenchman knows
these jungles around here
like the palm of his hand.

1719
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:28,312
He's a hunter, see?
All I know is, they changed
the whole setup here.

1720
02:21:28,397 --> 02:21:30,898
I think
we got the Japanese
on the run.

1721
02:21:30,983 --> 02:21:33,317
That's what
the Frenchman said.

1722
02:21:33,402 --> 02:21:36,195
Well, is it my lead?
Yeah.

1723
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:39,407
Let me see.
Come on, come on.
I got money on this.

1724
02:21:39,575 --> 02:21:43,536
[Emile]
Listen carefully, please.
Ceiling today unlimited.

1725
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,872
Thirty-three fighters,
Zeros,

1726
02:21:45,956 --> 02:21:47,999
have moved in
from Bougainville.

1727
02:21:48,083 --> 02:21:52,628
Their course
is approximately
0-2-3 degrees true.

1728
02:21:52,713 --> 02:21:55,047
[Engines Droning]

1729
02:21:55,132 --> 02:21:57,967
I'm certain
heavy bombers
will follow.

1730
02:21:58,051 --> 02:22:00,887
I think something big
is afoot.

1731
02:22:02,306 --> 02:22:04,223
That's all
I have time for now.

1732
02:22:04,308 --> 02:22:06,809
Joe and I must change
our position immediately.

1733
02:22:06,894 --> 02:22:08,853
Planes are
directly overhead.

1734
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:12,190
Two only, but they're
looking for us, I think.

1735
02:22:12,274 --> 02:22:14,066
They know about
where we are.

1736
02:22:14,151 --> 02:22:17,028
I will try to
get back to you later.
Good luck.

1737
02:22:17,112 --> 02:22:20,615
They got us
pretty well pinpointed.
Stay here.

1738
02:22:20,699 --> 02:22:24,035
In a few minutes,
it will be dark enough
to run for it.

1739
02:22:25,787 --> 02:22:28,122
You know, I think
we're right.

1740
02:22:28,207 --> 02:22:32,168
It looks like
they're going all out.
Even these planes.

1741
02:22:32,252 --> 02:22:34,712
They've stopped
looking for us.
They're going away.

1742
02:22:34,796 --> 02:22:37,298
Let's make
a run for it.

1743
02:22:39,009 --> 02:22:41,010
All right. Let's go.

1744
02:22:42,471 --> 02:22:45,473
[Machine Gun Fire]

1745
02:22:47,351 --> 02:22:50,353
A-And we have
a lot of fighter pilots
over in the ward,

1746
02:22:50,437 --> 02:22:54,065
and— and they keep talking
about a Frenchman.

1747
02:22:54,149 --> 02:22:57,902
The Frenchman said this, and
the Frenchman said that, and—

1748
02:22:57,986 --> 02:23:01,989
I was just wondering
if the Frenchman they're
talking about could be...

1749
02:23:03,867 --> 02:23:05,826
my Frenchman.

1750
02:23:07,162 --> 02:23:09,455
Yes, Miss Forbush,
it is.

1751
02:23:09,539 --> 02:23:11,540
I couldn't tell you
before, but—

1752
02:23:11,625 --> 02:23:14,835
Then he is
behind enemy lines.

1753
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:17,713
With Lieutenant Cable.

1754
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:25,972
Hello. This is Emile De Becque.
Please listen to me carefully.

1755
02:23:26,056 --> 02:23:29,517
I haven't much time.

1756
02:23:29,601 --> 02:23:33,604
My message today
must be brief and sad.

1757
02:23:36,275 --> 02:23:38,901
Lieutenant Cable—

1758
02:23:38,986 --> 02:23:40,945
my friend Joe—

1759
02:23:41,029 --> 02:23:43,364
died a few minutes ago.

1760
02:23:44,866 --> 02:23:47,368
I will never know
a finer man.

1761
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:51,956
I wish he could have
told you the news.

1762
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:54,417
The Japanese
are pulling out.

1763
02:23:54,501 --> 02:23:57,461
There is
great confusion here.

1764
02:23:57,546 --> 02:24:01,924
My guess is that the enemy
will try to evacuate troops
from Cape Esperance tonight.

1765
02:24:02,009 --> 02:24:04,302
This is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

1766
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:07,263
Make the most of it,
my friends.

1767
02:24:07,389 --> 02:24:10,599
You may not hear from me again.
They are coming back.
[Engines Droning]

1768
02:24:10,726 --> 02:24:12,643
They're right above me.
[Machine Gun Fire]

1769
02:24:12,728 --> 02:24:16,480
- Good-bye!
- Is that all? Is that all?
Can't you get him back?

1770
02:24:16,565 --> 02:24:19,942
Kennel to Frenchman.
Kennel to Frenchman.
Come in, Frenchman.

1771
02:24:20,027 --> 02:24:21,986
I'm sorry, sir.
He's cut off.

1772
02:24:22,070 --> 02:24:24,071
How far away.

1773
02:24:25,741 --> 02:24:27,742
Philadelphia, P.A.

1774
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:31,495
Poor Joe Cable.

1775
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:35,249
Captain Brackett, do you think
there's a chance I'll ever see
Emile De Becque again?

1776
02:24:35,334 --> 02:24:37,293
There's a chance.
Of course there's a chance.

1777
02:24:37,419 --> 02:24:39,837
I didn't even know
he was going.
Of course not.

1778
02:24:39,963 --> 02:24:42,965
How could he tell you?
Don't blame Emile De Becque.
He's okay.

1779
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:45,801
He's a wonderful guy.
Uh-huh.

1780
02:24:45,886 --> 02:24:48,012
He has got a chance,
hasn't he, Bill?

1781
02:24:48,096 --> 02:24:51,349
Of course.
There's always a chance.

1782
02:25:29,596 --> 02:25:31,514
Emile?

1783
02:25:37,521 --> 02:25:40,856
Emile, come back
so I can tell you something.

1784
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:43,651
I know what counts now.

1785
02:25:43,735 --> 02:25:45,736
Just you.

1786
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:49,323
All those other things?
The woman you had before?

1787
02:25:50,617 --> 02:25:52,743
Her color?

1788
02:25:52,828 --> 02:25:55,955
What— What piffle. I—

1789
02:25:56,039 --> 02:25:58,916
What a pinhead I was!

1790
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,796
Come back so I can tell you.
Oh, don't die before
I can tell you.

1791
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:07,967
All that matters
is us being together.

1792
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:10,636
That's all.

1793
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:13,848
If you think of what
you said to me that day,

1794
02:26:13,932 --> 02:26:15,933
you can stay alive, Emile.

1795
02:26:16,017 --> 02:26:18,269
I know you can.

1796
02:26:18,353 --> 02:26:20,688
Think of what you said.

1797
02:26:26,653 --> 02:26:31,699
# When you find
your true love #

1798
02:26:33,285 --> 02:26:37,496
# When you feel her
call you #

1799
02:26:37,581 --> 02:26:39,540
# Across #

1800
02:26:43,879 --> 02:26:48,507
# Then fly to her side #

1801
02:26:50,093 --> 02:26:55,347
# And make her your own #

1802
02:26:56,766 --> 02:27:00,269
# Or all through
your life ##

1803
02:27:02,063 --> 02:27:03,981
Live, Emile.

1804
02:27:04,065 --> 02:27:06,150
Live, Emile!

1805
02:27:06,234 --> 02:27:09,153
Live. Live!

1806
02:27:10,238 --> 02:27:12,239
Live.

1807
02:27:12,365 --> 02:27:15,826
Live.
[Bloody Mary]
Miss Nurse.

1808
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:18,913
Please.
Please, Miss Nurse.

1809
02:27:19,915 --> 02:27:21,832
Where is
Lootellan Cable?

1810
02:27:21,917 --> 02:27:23,709
Who are you?

1811
02:27:23,793 --> 02:27:26,504
I am mother of Liat.

1812
02:27:26,588 --> 02:27:28,339
Who?

1813
02:27:29,591 --> 02:27:31,842
Liat.

1814
02:27:31,927 --> 02:27:34,428
She will marry no one
but Lootellan Cable.

1815
02:27:38,099 --> 02:27:41,101
Oh. Oh, my darling.

1816
02:27:48,944 --> 02:27:50,694
[Man On Speaker]
All right, hear this.

1817
02:27:50,779 --> 02:27:54,031
All those outfits
that are waiting for loading,
please keep in position.

1818
02:27:54,115 --> 02:27:56,075
We'll be loading
immediately.

1819
02:27:56,159 --> 02:27:58,661
Hey, Billis.
Let's head back, huh?

1820
02:27:58,745 --> 02:28:02,331
Our outfit's about
a mile back down the beach.
Suppose they call our names.

1821
02:28:02,457 --> 02:28:06,627
Yeah, they may be ready
for us to board the ship.
They won't be ready for hours.

1822
02:28:06,711 --> 02:28:08,712
This is the navy!

1823
02:28:08,797 --> 02:28:12,591
Huh. Look at that beach,
swarming with eager beavers.

1824
02:28:12,676 --> 02:28:14,593
10,000 guys.

1825
02:28:14,678 --> 02:28:18,681
All right, you men.
Stay down there with your own
unit where you belong!

1826
02:28:18,765 --> 02:28:21,392
You Seabees, you belong
down the beach this way.

1827
02:28:21,476 --> 02:28:24,645
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where I can
find Captain Brackett, sir?

1828
02:28:24,771 --> 02:28:28,107
Down the beach this way.
Thank you, sir.
That's all.

1829
02:28:30,026 --> 02:28:33,195
I beg your pardon, sir.
Can I speak to you
a moment, sir?

1830
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:35,239
Who is it?
Billis, sir.

1831
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:37,575
Luther Billis.
Yes, Billis.
What is it?

1832
02:28:37,659 --> 02:28:39,994
We're moving out now.
I know, sir.

1833
02:28:40,078 --> 02:28:42,079
Stewpot, the Professor
and me was wondering...

1834
02:28:42,163 --> 02:28:45,374
if anything is being done
about rescuing the Frenchman
off that island.

1835
02:28:45,458 --> 02:28:47,418
We hereby volunteer
for such a project.

1836
02:28:47,502 --> 02:28:51,380
A triple diversionary activity
like I done to get him on there.

1837
02:28:51,464 --> 02:28:54,425
You could, uh—
You could drop us
in three rubber boats...

1838
02:28:54,509 --> 02:28:56,510
on three different sides
of the island.

1839
02:28:56,595 --> 02:28:59,388
Confuse them
out of their minds!

1840
02:28:59,472 --> 02:29:01,515
Get the picture?

1841
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,101
That's very fine, Billis,
but you're too late.

1842
02:29:04,185 --> 02:29:06,145
Operation Alligator
is under way.

1843
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:09,982
Landings were made on a bunch of
Japanese-held islands during the
night and early this morning.

1844
02:29:10,066 --> 02:29:12,276
Mary Louise Island
was the first one they hit.

1845
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:15,112
How about
that Frenchman?
Did they get him?

1846
02:29:15,196 --> 02:29:17,448
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

1847
02:29:17,532 --> 02:29:20,367
Lieutenant Buzz Adams
flew up there to find out.

1848
02:29:20,452 --> 02:29:23,954
But it would be just too bad
if a part of this huge operation
couldn't have saved...

1849
02:29:24,039 --> 02:29:27,249
one of the two guys
who made it all possible.

1850
02:29:33,715 --> 02:29:36,050
The big ones
are battleships.

1851
02:29:36,134 --> 02:29:39,136
And the little ones
are, uh, destroyers.

1852
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:41,680
They're moving out,
you see, because—

1853
02:29:41,765 --> 02:29:44,433
well, there's been
a big change.

1854
02:29:44,517 --> 02:29:46,894
They won't be around
here much anymore.

1855
02:29:46,978 --> 02:29:49,730
Just off and on,
a few of us.

1856
02:29:51,733 --> 02:29:54,652
Did you understand
anything I said?

1857
02:29:54,736 --> 02:29:57,821
[Sighs]
Vous ne comprenez pas?

1858
02:29:57,906 --> 02:29:59,823
Oui, oui.
Nous comprenons.

1859
02:29:59,908 --> 02:30:01,825
Oui.

1860
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:04,286
Now, while I'm down
at the hospital,

1861
02:30:04,371 --> 02:30:07,581
you've got to promise me
to mangez everything—

1862
02:30:07,666 --> 02:30:10,584
everything that's put
before you on the table.

1863
02:30:10,669 --> 02:30:13,629
Sur la table.

1864
02:30:13,713 --> 02:30:16,131
Sur "le" table?

1865
02:30:16,216 --> 02:30:18,175
Sur la table.

1866
02:30:18,259 --> 02:30:21,053
Oh. Sur la table.

1867
02:30:21,137 --> 02:30:23,097
Merci.

1868
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:26,183
Jerome! Come back here
and sit down.

1869
02:30:41,783 --> 02:30:44,076
Asseyez-vous!

1870
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:48,831
Now, you have to learn to
mind me when I talk to you
and be nice to me too...

1871
02:30:51,292 --> 02:30:54,002
because I love you
very much.

1872
02:30:55,463 --> 02:30:57,423
Je t'aime.
[Chuckles]

1873
02:30:57,507 --> 02:31:00,008
Je vous aime.

1874
02:31:00,093 --> 02:31:02,010
Now, mangez.

1875
02:31:05,515 --> 02:31:09,351
Chantez, Nellie.
Mmm. I will not
sing that song.

1876
02:31:09,436 --> 02:31:11,770
You just want to laugh
at my French accent.

1877
02:31:17,777 --> 02:31:21,029
All right.
But you gotta help me.

1878
02:31:22,615 --> 02:31:25,159
