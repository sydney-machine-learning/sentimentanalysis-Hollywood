- ya-ha !

00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:25,931
That's marvelous. Tomorrow you give me
lessons, and I give you your money back.

4
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:28,938
oh, I feel so good.

00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:34,637

they're playing.

00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,646
Yeah. ''Roslein. ''

- ooh !
- Go on. I'm sorry. Go on. Please.

12
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:57,490

15
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:07,302
you know, as a rule, Americans
speak German with a very bad accent.

16
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,643
But your accent is
really horrible.

17
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:13,512
oh, Christian.

18
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,644
- This has been so wonderful.
- yes.

19
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,654
I wanna thank you.

20
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,849
you've been more than
generous with your time.

21
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,793
Well, that's only because
I've had the very worst of intentions.

22
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:27,660
( laughing )
Thank you.

23
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,929
oh, I hate to leave.
I hate to say good-bye now.

24
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:36,530
Why-- Why don't you
say good-bye in the morning ?

25
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:39,337
No. No, I can't.
I've got to leave too early.

26
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,937
Now, look,
it is New y ear's eve.

27
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:46,847
you go back to America,
I never see you again.

28
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:51,820
- And please, I want you
to spend the evening with me.
- No.

29
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,722
Too bad.

30
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,726
Do I have a rival ?

31
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,728
- Michael.
- Who ?

32
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,991
Michael.

33
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,363
But I think Michael
would not mind if I just...

34
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:06,403
stole one tiny
little Bavarian evening.

35
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,404
Are you kidding ?

36
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:12,909
I don't think it would even occur
to Michael that anybody would ask me.

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,383
- All right. All right,
Christian, I'd love to.
- Wonderful.

- Thank you.

41
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:51,675
- you look really-- I want
to present my sister Freda.
- Charmed.

42
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,717
I'm so happy
that you came tonight...

43
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:57,015
because I composed a little
piece of music for you.

44
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,454
And, uh, it's-- Well,
would you like to hear it ?

45
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:03,459
- I'd love to.
- Really ?

- yes.

48
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:15,938
- Isn't it nice ? Come on.
- It's wonderful.

What's the matter ?

66
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:59,436
oh, you know,
I was just in Berlin, and I--

67
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,775
I saw some
Nazi demonstrations.

68
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:07,408
But I didn't realize
it had gone this far.

69
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,777
Not-not here...

70
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:14,517
in this little town.

71
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:18,357
It's a little frightening.

72
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:23,092
Well, do you think that being
a Nazi is such a terrible thing ?

73
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:33,568
Christian--
Christian, are you a Nazi ?

74
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:39,014
No, I am not a Nazi.
I'm not political at all.

75
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:44,816
But I think that they stand
for something hopeful in Germany.

76
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:48,016
Christian, you don't
really believe that.

77
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:50,855
yes, I believe this.

78
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,125
But why ? Why ?

79
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:58,794
What can you possibly find
to justify Hitler ?

80
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:02,665
I think that--

81
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:06,937
that Hitler will bring us
a better life.

82
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,944
Is the life you have now
so terrible ?

83
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,947
No, but, uh--
My life is not so terrible,

84
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:15,382
but I don't wish to spend the rest
of it wearing fancy sweaters...

85
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,852
and teaching fat little
children how to ski...

86
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,946
and being charming
and picturesque.

87
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,253
I can understand
your wanting more than that.

88
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:25,955
I think, perhaps, you cannot
understand what it means...

89
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,966
to live on tips from foreigners
in your own country.

90
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:36,365
you know what I really am ?

91
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,841
I'm not a ski instructor even.

92
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,710
I do this for two
or three months in the year.

93
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,181
When the season is over,
I go to work in a little shop...

94
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:51,244
as an assistant to my father,
and I'm a shoemaker.

95
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,347
- And you don't want
to be a shoemaker ?
- No, I don't.

96
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:57,518
- I want to be something else.
- Then you don't have to remain one.

97
00:08:57,594 --> 00:09:02,122
oh, this is
not the united States.

98
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,827
It's so hard
to explain to you.

99
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,393
But you see,
it's very difficult...

100
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,737
for people to rise above
their class in Europe.

101
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:14,368
I tell you something.

102
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:17,379
At one time, I wanted
very much to be a doctor.

103
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:21,979
And I worked
very hard for this.

104
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:27,285
And when there was no longer any money,
I was forced to give it up...

105
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:31,157
because we have
no free university here.

106
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:35,221
And I think this is--
this is where Hitler can help us.

107
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:39,895
I think that he-- he has promised
to change all this.

108
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,634
Christian, Hitler promises
to conquer the whole world.

109
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,439
Ja. But this is
a direct result...

110
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:51,379
of a handful of completely
insane fanatics--

111
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,382
- oh.
- yeah.

112
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,577
It was, and this will pass.

113
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:58,143
It will not pass !

114
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:01,247
It's going to get worse
and worse and worse.

115
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,850
And I think it's
going to end in war.

116
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:12,695
I think that we should
not discuss this...

117
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,728
because I don't know
all the answers.

118
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:19,742
I know you don't know
all the answers.

119
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,337
And with political discussions
we go round and round,

120
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:26,177
and nothing is ever settled.

121
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,879
let's go back in
and have a nice time.

have thus come to a tragic climax.

of the low countries on May 1 0,
have thus come to a tragic climax.

virtually alone,

133
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:37,751
faces the German military power

- you know the French.
Don't you read our papers ?
- Where are they ?

147
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:24,002
When I was a little boy, I promised
my father I'd kill a Frenchman for him.

148
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:27,770
They shot off his leg
in Verdun,ja, in 1 91 6.

So I promised him--
on Christmas eve it was--

a good time there.

00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:12,098
( Christian )
Maeschen, stay down!

172
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:16,344
( Gunshot )

173
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,626
( Speaking French )

174
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:34,527
Streicher, hold your fire.

175
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,041
- Streicher.
-( Gunfire Continues )

176
00:15:56,552 --> 00:16:00,181
Brandt.
Streicher, come on.

177
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:10,891
Brandt.

178
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:16,002
Tell him to go back and
tell the others to surrender...

179
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,336
because we now have them
in a cross fire.

180
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:23,140
Go. Allez.

181
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,381
Ecoutez moi.

182
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,216
- Maeschen is dead ?
- What ? What ?

183
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,448
Maeschen is dead ?

184
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:35,456
yeah.

185
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:37,685
I'm sure his father
is very happy now, eh ?

186
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,285
Allez! Allez!
Vite!

187
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:50,938
( Speaking French )

188
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,474
Arretez!

189
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,033
Arretez!

190
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,274
Nous sommes fini!

191
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:43,984
- Captain Hardenburg.
- Ah, Diestl. Nice to see you.

192
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:47,495
- I understand you have had
a little difficulty on the road.
- yes, sir.

193
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:49,497
- At ease.
- Thank you, sir.

194
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,863
There were young conscripts,
sir, making a token gesture.

195
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:54,425
There was a roadblock,
and it was quite unavoidable.

196
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:57,802
There is no need to be apologetic.
It makes for excellent training.

197
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:01,331
- I want to commend you
for the way you have handled it.
- Thank you, sir.

198
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,245
We had one casualty, you know, sir.
Private Maeschen was killed.

199
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,613
oh, yes.
uh, Private Maeschen.

200
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,077
Did he perform his duty ?

201
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:14,645
yes, sir. He killed one of
the enemy with his first shot...

202
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:18,454
and then became excited
and failed to take cover.

203
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,462
Too bad.
I'm sure he fought bravely.

204
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,500
That's wonderful,
isn't it ?

205
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,503
yes, sir.

206
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:31,131
Sir, with your permission, I would like
to write a letter to his family.

207
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,836
Never mind, Diestl.
I will do it. Leutnant!

208
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:43,046
Since you are attached to us,
I wonder if you would mind
taking a photograph for my wife.

209
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:45,052
We had always
planned to come here.

210
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,920
- It would be a pleasure, Captain.
- Come on, Diestl.

211
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,449
- I'm sure your wife
is not interested to see me.
- oh, yes, yes, yes.

212
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:57,465
I've written her about you and many of
the men. I'm sure she's most interested.

213
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:01,399
Just a moment.

214
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,099
We will stand on the steps.
Come on, Diestl.

215
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:07,165
With the church
in the background.

216
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:17,080
( Bell Tolling )

217
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:21,655
A great day.
A day of historic importance.

218
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:24,625
In years to come, we will
look back on this and say...

219
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:28,629
we were there at the dawn
of the new era.

220
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,334
Ay ! Ja. Now, Captain,
this is the one.

221
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:35,336
( Speaks German )

222
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,342
- ( Indistinct Chattering )
- All right, settle down.

223
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,352
Settle down !

224
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,354
This is New y ork City property.

225
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:56,289
Stop spitting and throwing butts
on the floor and stop shoving.

226
00:19:56,358 --> 00:20:00,454
Nobody's gonna be left behind. The
army's got plenty of room for everybody.

227
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:09,129
- What's wrong ?
- It's cold.

228
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,229
Now cough.

229
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,241
Turn your head and cough.

230
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,414
All right, breathe in.

231
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,455
Breathe out.

232
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,787
Now breathe in.

233
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,792
out.

234
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:35,730
All right, bend over.

235
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,733
- Bend over and touch your toes.
- oh.

236
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,429
okay.

237
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:45,598
For a man your age in your profession,
you're in excellent health.

238
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:49,838
- How do you manage it ?
- Clean liquor.

239
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:53,348
Give this to the board.
Next man.

240
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:55,679
you didn't register
in California ?

241
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:59,448
yes, I did. But I came east before
I got my classification.

242
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:03,423
- you came to New y ork
to get a defense job ?
- To get any job.

243
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,517
Michael Whiteacre.

244
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:15,536
Sit down over here,
Mr. Whiteacre.

245
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:24,440
you must be very busy,
Mr. Whiteacre.

246
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:27,910
I'm told we had a special call
from Selective Service headquarters...

247
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,540
asking us not to waste
any of your valuable time.

248
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:33,948
Well, I'm rehearsing a show
against a deadline.

249
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:36,612
Well, we'll try
to rush you through quickly.

250
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:38,781
How long will this show run,
do you think ?

251
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:41,620
I don't know.
No one ever does.

252
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,627
Well, this is March.

253
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:47,495
If it runs very long
your understudy will get a break.

254
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:51,228
We're booking you
for uncle Sam as ofJune 1 5.

255
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,964
- I don't think that's quite fair.
- you can file an appeal, if you like.

256
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:56,131
oh, I'll appeal.

257
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:59,802
- Is there anything else
you'd like to discuss ?
- No, I'll just appeal.

258
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:02,812
Just see the secretary outside.

259
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:09,019
Ackerman.

260
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,486
Sit down over here,
Mr. Ackerman.

261
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,222
Mr. Ackerman, you don't seem to have
any dependent relatives...

262
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,327
or any occupation essential
to national defense.

263
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:31,364
Can you think of any reason
why you should not be classified 1 -A ?

264
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:34,809
No, sir, I can't.

265
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,074
I see you work for Macy's.

266
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:41,847
you'll stay for the Easter rush,
and you will reportJune 1 5.

267
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,218
I think that'll be all.

268
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,450
Thank you very much.

269
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:54,190
Just a moment.
May I have your form, please ?

270
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,460
Ralph Benton.

271
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:59,992
Anybody got a cigarette ?

272
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:04,007
- Need a cigarette ?
- oh, thanks.

273
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,813
Here.

274
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,514
How do you spell
''extenuating'' ?

275
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:17,383
- Hmm ?
- Extenuating.

276
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,389
uh, I don't know.

277
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:22,051
E-x-t-e-- No. E-x-t--

278
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,060
Illiteracy, that'll do it.

279
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,733
I heard you sing
a lot of times.

280
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,735
oh, you have ?
At the club ?

281
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:34,237
- on the radio.
- oh.

282
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:37,741
- Are you singing at a club ?
- No, rehearsing a show.

283
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,743
- on Broadway ?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:41,745
What's the name of it ?

285
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,747
Soft Shoes.

286
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:47,444
Soft Shoes.
I gotta remember that.

287
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:50,112
let's have a drink.
Don't frustrate me.

288
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:53,385
Anybody that can't spell
extenuating is a friend of mine.

289
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:56,018
Come on.

290
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,266
you know, sometimes I think
I give off a scent or something.

291
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:05,427
- you know, rouses the female.
- Hmm ?

292
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,437
- Those girls.
- Where ?

293
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:10,235
oh, wait a minute. you mean
to tell me that you didn't--

294
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:13,641
- oh, your antenna's turned off.
- No, I didn't notice.

295
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,645
oh, you're sick.

296
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:20,946
- Have you ever had a girl ?
- Have I ever had a girl ?

297
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:22,952
That's what I thought.

298
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,286
listen, Ackerman, tonight I'm giving
a party. Girls, females, broads.

299
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:31,317
you will attend. you will capture
one and carry her off to your cave.

300
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:34,262
- you will attend ?
- Sure. yeah.

301
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:38,962
Good. let us not discuss
this sort of topic any longer.
let us discuss alcohol.

- May I refresh your drink ?

314
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,564
Thank you, no.
I'm fine.

315
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,904
Have you met everyone ?

316
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,603
That's all right.
I was listening to the music.

317
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,581
Michael's told me
all about you.

318
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,711
- He has ?
- y-yes.

319
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:34,315
No, I meant, I only met him
this morning at the draft board.

320
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:39,020
- you met Michael at the draft board ?
- yes.

321
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:41,030
And he was 1 -A ?

322
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:44,033
We're both 1 -A.

323
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:48,299
- Excuse me, would you ?
- yes.

324
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,809
* you saw me standing alone *

325
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:57,247
- * Without a dream in my heart *
- I wanna talk to you.

326
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:03,619
- Good evening. How are you tonight ?
- Fine, thanks, and you ?

327
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:09,192
- Hi, Hope.
- Hi, Mike. How are you ?

328
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,626
- Fine. How are you ?
I want you to meet somebody.
- Good.

329
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,630
- oh ? Friend of yours ?
- yes.

330
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:19,335
Noah, this is Hope Plowman.
Noah Ackerman.

331
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,337
- Hello.
- How do you do ?

332
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:24,602
See if you can cheer him up.
I don't think he likes my music.

333
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:30,613
Actually, I have been listening.

334
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:35,246
oh, my, what a lovely view.

335
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,253
Isn't it ?

336
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,855
( Michael )
Yes, Margaret ?

337
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,864
I hear you're being drafted.

338
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:59,336
- I'm not being drafted.
- Mr. Ackerman says you are.

339
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,710
Mr. Ackerman doesn't know
what rabbits can be pulled out
of a hat in Washington.

340
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:06,443
look, I'm not a hero,
and I'm not a pigeon.

341
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:08,678
The pigeons can do
my fighting for me.

342
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,017
oh, Michael,
what's the matter with you ?

343
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,488
you think I hate you
for trying to get out of it ?

344
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:16,492
I don't.
Really, I don't.

345
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,429
Anything you do is okay with me,
but you start to feel guilty about it,

346
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:26,198
- then we start having fights,
and you take it out on me.
- I don't feel guilty !

347
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,798
It's just that I'm against war
and this whole drummed-up,
superpatriotic atmosphere.

348
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,743
you just don't want to get shot.
Nobody wants to get shot.

349
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:38,077
So stop trying
to convince yourself.

350
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:40,549
Forget it.

351
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:45,453
- I got a sick show on my hands !
- yes, yes, yes, yes.

352
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:49,823
look, Michael,
this is me, Margaret.

353
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:51,828
I understand you.

354
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,994
you're a heel, but you're
not that big a heel.

355
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,001
And then, too,

356
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:00,697
they fish for fish
in the river.

357
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,262
I was told that.

358
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:07,436
- I like your tie.
- you do ?

359
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:10,647
I just saw it,
and I bought it.

360
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:18,913
Do you think
it's gonna rain ?

361
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,857
- I like to walk in the rain.
- I do to.

362
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:24,019
- you do ?
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:26,563
- you wanna walk ?
- All right.

364
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,565
- let's walk.
- okay.

365
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:34,901
- What are you gonna tell him ?
- Who ?

366
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:37,372
- Michael.
- Nothing.

367
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:39,375
oh.

368
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,914
Well, maybe so.

369
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,177
New y ork City must be quite frightening
to a girl from the country.

370
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,188
oh, no, it isn't.

371
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:54,884
The truth is it puts on
an act of sophistication,

372
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:58,793
but at heart
it's strictly provincial.

373
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,024
I don't think
it's provincial.

374
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:03,566
Anyway, not after Vermont.

375
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:06,228
- Vermont ?
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:11,501
New y ork City-- I must say--
does have some beautiful women.

377
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:14,305
Flashy, some of them.

378
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,074
you know,
I'm told European women...

379
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:20,117
are more mature emotionally.

380
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:23,585
- They are ?
- oh.

381
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,817
As a matter of fact,
friends of mine have told me--

382
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,128
- Well, anyway.
- What time is it ?

383
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:36,132
- It's late. We better be getting back.
- No. I'd like to go home.

384
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:40,929
- oh. Well, I'll take you home.
- Thank you.

385
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,133
- Where do you live ?
- Brooklyn.

386
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:47,143
- Brooklyn.
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,689
Well, at last.

388
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:11,701
- Now we take the bus.
- Now we take the bus ?

389
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:29,152
- Now what ?
- Now we walk.

390
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,819
- Margaret.
- yeah ?

391
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,830
- Don't.
- Don't what ?

392
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:44,334
- Don't be angry with me.
- Why not ?

393
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,304
you have been very charming.

394
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:50,465
you have not been understanding.

395
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:53,806
In fact, you haven't even been
conversational all evening long.

396
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,008
I'm sorry, Margaret.
Really, I am.

397
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:03,349
But lately it seems
we can't talk without arguing.

398
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,686
you haven't the faintest idea
what's bothering me.

399
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,792
Honey, I'd flip without you.

400
00:31:12,863 --> 00:31:16,299
- you sure would.
- Well, that's the truth.

401
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,835
you're so right about me.

402
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:20,837
I sure am.

403
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:26,432
- look, why don't we just sit
and be quiet ?
- And then what ?

404
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,571
Then you kiss me.

405
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,522
Then I kiss you.

406
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:52,001
oh, Michael,
I love you so.

407
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:00,276
Are we getting warmer ?

408
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:06,247
you'll be happy to know
that we're here.

409
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:11,219
Good night.

410
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:15,748
I wanna say I'm pleased--

411
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:19,762
very pleased, I mean,
to have brought you home.

412
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,232
Thank you.

413
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:27,028
I mean,
I'm really pleased.

414
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:37,246
you do that with
your other girls, not with me.

415
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:40,078
yes. No !
No, I don't.

416
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,585
oh, only with me ?

417
00:32:43,654 --> 00:32:45,747
you don't understand
what I mean.

418
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:48,758
I suppose you think that you're
such an attractive young man...

419
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:51,420
that any girl would fall all over
herself to let you kiss her.

420
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:53,793
- oh, God.
- Never, in all my days,

421
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:58,096
have I met such an opinionated,
self-centered young man.

422
00:32:58,168 --> 00:33:02,195
- Good night, Mr. Ackerman.
- No, don't. I--

423
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:05,208
- Hope.
-( Door Closes )

424
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,685
( Tapping )

425
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:57,526
Stop that.
you'll wake everyone.

426
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,264
How do I get back
to the city ?

427
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,800
you're lost ?

428
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:13,709
No one will find me
again, ever.

429
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,974
you're a terrible fool,
aren't you ?

430
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:26,286
Well, you walk two blocks
to your left,

431
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:29,622
and you wait for the bus--
the one that comes from your left--

432
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,991
and you take it
to Eastern Parkway.

433
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:35,054
Noah, are you listening to me ?

434
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,235
I wanna say
something to you.

435
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:41,863
I am not opinionated.

436
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:46,342
I don't think I have a single opinion
in the whole world.

437
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,675
I don't know why I kissed you.
I just couldn't help it.

438
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:53,205
I guess-- I guess
I wanted to impress you.

439
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:57,014
I was afraid
that if I was myself...

440
00:34:57,087 --> 00:35:00,022
you wouldn't
look at me twice.

441
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,159
It's been a very confusing night.

442
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:07,061
I don't think I've ever been through
anything so confusing.

443
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,691
you tell me tomorrow.

444
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:17,540
The bus to Eastern Parkway.

445
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:33,889
Don't get lost
on the way home.

446
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,731
uh, the bus
to Eastern Parkway,

447
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,734
and then--

448
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:49,900
I love you.
I love you.

449
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:55,068
Good night.

450
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:58,080
Thanks for taking me home.

451
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:48,197
- This is really boring here.
- Don't be so impatient, Christian.

452
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,206
Wait till you see her. A more delicious
little strudel you have never seen.

453
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:56,404
Really superb,
typically French, and very--

454
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:58,639
( Chuckles )

455
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:02,444
Well, I could use
a little strudel, Brandt,

456
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:05,281
but we have been here--

457
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,947
yeah, two hours.

458
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:10,583
- To be French is to be late.
- Two hours.

459
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:12,923
It's part of their charm.

460
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:16,395
I only hope they get here before
I'm too blind drunk to recognize them.

461
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:20,491
Francoise, please. of course the men are
Germans, but not all Germans are swine.

462
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:22,934
- No ?
- oh, I promise you, one drink.

463
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:26,770
-Just one drink, then we'll go.
- I don't want to be seen
fraternizing with the enemy.

464
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:28,775
- I don't want to be beaten
by my neighbors.
- Please.

465
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:31,471
I would not look good
with a shaved head.

466
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:34,674
- Francoise, please. Please !
- oh !

467
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:36,842
All right, I'll go.

468
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:40,649
But not because of your arguments,
because I'm curious.

469
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:43,350
I'd like to observe
one of these supermen.

470
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:47,589
I'm a city girl. I've never seen
a pig up close. Come on.

471
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,599
Here they are.

472
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:59,173
Ah, at last you are here.

473
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,641
If you didn't look so pretty,
I'd give you a good spank
in a very important place.

474
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:05,509
- Perhaps I'd like it.
- yes, we can talk about that later.

475
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,707
How nice of you to come,
Francoise.

476
00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:11,582
May I present Herr Leutnant Diestl.
This is Francoise.

477
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:14,520
Enchante de faire
votre connaissance.

478
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:18,025
- I'm sorry, but that's
all the French I know.
- oh, that's all right.

479
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:21,529
you are all the German I know,
and perhaps, all I care to know.

480
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:25,157
( Nervous Chuckle )
And this is my little Simone.

481
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:28,259
It's a pleasure, Leutnant.
I'm sorry that we're a little late.

482
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:31,772
you see, didn't I tell you
they were worth waiting for ?

483
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,508
Would you care to sit ?

484
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:38,512
oh, really gallant you are.

485
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,708
Are you always as dashing
as that with the ladies ?

486
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:44,081
yes, always,
if they are ladies.

487
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:48,248
I must warn you not to be
deceived by this Aryan charm.

488
00:38:48,323 --> 00:38:51,952
- He is the most famous
lady-killer in the Alps.
- oh, la, la.

489
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:57,363
Tell me, lieutenant. How many
French ladies have you killed ?

490
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:03,098
Well, I think that I'm not
clever enough to do that.

491
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:05,731
But perhaps if I serve in France
for a little while,

492
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:09,208
I could learn how
with your very kind help.

493
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:13,338
But I'm confused. I thought you
came here to teach us something--

494
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:17,909
how to be tall and blond
and clean and efficient.

495
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:21,581
Perhaps if you were not French
and I was not German,

496
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:25,752
but we were just simply Europeans,
we could learn from each other.

497
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,920
Don't you think ?

498
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:31,659
united Europe, of course.
How stupid of me.

499
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:35,499
you Germans have charmed me so that
I forgot that you were all idealists.

500
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,403
oh, now, look, doesn't somebody
know a good, dirty joke ?

501
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:41,067
Ferien, Francoise,
tu nous auras gache un soirre.

502
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:45,044
( French Continues,
Indistinct )

503
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:49,675
How many of us do you plan to murder in
the name of that golden plan of yours ?

504
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:56,720
If there is no unification, we will all
go on murdering each other anyhow.

505
00:39:56,791 --> 00:40:00,022
I know a nice little restaurant in
Montmartre. It has a beautiful garden.

506
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:02,029
We can have it all to ourselves.
Shall we go ?

507
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:04,588
yeah. We can answer
all historical questions there.

508
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:07,760
- And we don't even
need to get arrested.
- No, wait.

509
00:40:07,836 --> 00:40:10,100
I would like to know...

510
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:14,540
how many French lives
you have personally contributed
to that Wagnerian dream.

511
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,578
- Now, look, this is no longer funny.
- let go of me !

512
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,579
I want an answer
from the boche.

513
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:21,581
Francoise !

514
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:24,049
How many Frenchmen
have you killed ?

515
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:27,821
I've killed no one.

516
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,825
No one.

517
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:35,989
But if I have to sacrifice
a few lives for peace,

518
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:39,659
I will do it.

519
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:42,931
Ja. Even if
one of them is my own.

520
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:50,277
Now I have seen
a pig up close.

521
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,543
Thank you for your wine.

522
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,553
Oh, folle.

523
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:04,756
- Laissez mois tranquille.
- Tu te rends compte de ce
que tu viene de faire.

524
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:07,420
( Speaking French )

525
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,429
Christian.

526
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:22,442
- Good night, Simone. Thank you.
- I am so sorry.

527
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,104
- oh.
- Really, I am.

528
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,547
Good night, Francoise.

529
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:44,224
lieutenant.

530
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:48,099
- I'm sorry. I should not
have made such a scene.
- No. No.

531
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:50,103
Please.

532
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:52,662
My husband was killed...

533
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,471
in 1 940 in Belgium.

534
00:41:56,544 --> 00:42:00,640
And all this talk about sacrificing
lives in order to have peace...

535
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:03,548
just doesn't
make any sense to me.

536
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:07,679
The only way to peace is to stop
killing each other.

537
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:15,260
I think about this
1 ,000 times in a day.

538
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:20,228
And I wish it would seem
so simple to me.

539
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:28,435
Could I have
another glass of wine ?

540
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:30,443
yes, of course.

541
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,420
This is my house.

542
00:42:48,496 --> 00:42:50,726
This is where I live.

543
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:06,543
I think that I will not...

544
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:10,550
try to tell you how lovely...

545
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:12,609
this evening was for me.

546
00:43:16,624 --> 00:43:21,561
But I would like so much
to see you again.

547
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:24,564
you're still the conqueror,

548
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,233
a young, golden god of war.

549
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:35,574
Perhaps...

550
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:37,975
when the gold has worn off
a little.

551
00:43:57,565 --> 00:43:59,499
Good night.

552
00:44:13,548 --> 00:44:15,083
( Bell Tolling )

553
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,482
( Bell Tolling )

554
00:44:21,522 --> 00:44:24,582
Well, that's one of the hazards you run
when you have a daughter.

555
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,390
one day she's going to come
to you and say, ''I love him.

556
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:30,522
I want to marry him.''

557
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:34,159
Mm-hmm. That's one
of the hazards.

558
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:37,170
But you haven't told me anything
about this man at all.

559
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:42,404
oh, he's-- he's gentle
and he's clever.

560
00:44:44,112 --> 00:44:48,105
He's not just a man,
he's a boy.

561
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:50,116
And poor.

562
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:52,846
And poor.

563
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,085
He writes me a letter a day,
even when we see each other
in New y ork every night.

564
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:02,125
And he's alone.

565
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:32,192
He's Jewish, Father.

566
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:47,622
Father, this is Noah.

567
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,996
- How do you do ?
- How do you do, sir ?

568
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:58,468
Well, seems to me Mr. Ackerman
and I might have a little talk.

569
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,697
Certainly, sir.

570
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:03,001
Why don't you finish
your coffee, Hope ?

571
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:05,702
We won't be very long.

572
00:46:18,522 --> 00:46:21,320
That's Jack Marshall's.

573
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:26,329
I went to school with his father,
my father with his father.

574
00:46:27,632 --> 00:46:30,260
Virgil Smith's law office.

575
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:33,599
one of his people did the legal work
when they incorporated this town.

577
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:41,105
Well, looks like
it's gonna be a nice day.

;';'( Choir, Indistinct )

579
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:01,364
It's the family plot.
Seven generations of Plowmans there,

580
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,467
Hope's mother too.

581
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,102
There's the school.

582
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:12,540
Mr. Plowman, um,

583
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:16,102
I don't have a family plot.

584
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,375
I don't have a family.

585
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:23,648
I earn $3 5 a week,
and I'm 1 -A in the draft.

586
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:27,953
But I love Hope, and I shall
love her for all my life.

587
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,967
you're doing an awful thing,

588
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:41,971
putting a man to the test
of his principles.

589
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,136
I wish to heaven you'd
turn around and get on that bus
and never see Hope again.

590
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:52,806
But you won't do that,
will ya ?

591
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:58,719
Didn't think you would.

592
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,622
Anybody from town asked
to marry Hope, I'd say,

593
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:05,628
''Come on out to the house.
We got turkey for dinner.''

594
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,794
I never knew a Jew before.

595
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,931
you go along all your life
thinkin' a certain way,

596
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:21,410
someone jolts you, you have
to look inside yourself.

597
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:25,245
That's what you've made me do,
and I'm not fond of you for it.

598
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:48,064
I was just telling Mr. Ackerman
we've got turkey for dinner.

599
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:01,751

If you don't open the door,
we are obliged to break it in.

00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:19,863
Is this headquarter's idea of a friendly
little visit for me to photograph ?

603
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,871
Ja.

I wish I knew.

The boy's 1 6 years old.

Half of the time we don't know
where he is. He don't come home at all.

- oh, monsieur.
- I promise you. I give you
my word. He will not be hurt.

617

his labor duties.

00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,335
I would like to apply
for a transfer, sir.

622
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,773
Why ?

623
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:08,610
I think I am not able
to do this work.

624
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:11,876
you don't believe
you are suited to this work ?

625
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:14,213
I don't believe
in arresting children, sir.

626
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:24,956
I spent four years
at Spandau,

627
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:27,691
two years at the war academy.

628
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:30,928
I should be in Russia,

yes, sir.

645
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:45,734
Then stop being a child !

646
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:49,802
Don't you know that when you
became a soldier, you contracted
for killing in all its forms ?

647
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:54,608
I do not think it possible
to remake this world...

from the basement of
a dirty little police station.

649

It doesn't matter
what you believe.

650
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:06,529
under battle conditions, I could
shoot you for what you have just done.

651
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,994
And I would.

652
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:17,067
The German Army is invincible
because it is an army...

653
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:19,974
that obeys orders,

any order,
no matter how distasteful.

- I cannot believe--
- Be quiet.

656
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:29,509
It has no sentimentalists,

657
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:33,488
no moralists,
no individualists.

658
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:37,584
you will have no future in it
if you don't understand that.

659
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:40,323
you may have no future at all
if you oppose it.

660
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:44,128
I trouble to tell you this
because you have a fine record.

661
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:46,431
you will be
a creative soldier...

662
00:53:46,503 --> 00:53:50,462
once you get all this
thinking knocked out of you.

663
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:54,238
Well, we will forget it
for the present.

664
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:57,212
Now, as I was saying,
I would like you to do me a favor.

665
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:00,079
I have secured
a piece of lace.

666
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:04,979
Very beautiful. Black.

667
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,546
For my wife.

668
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:10,752
I'd hoped to give it
to her in person,

669
00:54:10,828 --> 00:54:13,353
but I'm too important here.

670
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:17,958
And since I can't, I would like you
to deliver it to her in Berlin.

671
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:22,638
yes, sir.

672
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:25,038
Give her my most tender regards.

673
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:28,203
you may say that
I think of her constantly.

674
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:30,610
The address is on the package.

675
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:32,979
Enjoy your leave !

676
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:01,972
-( Doorbell Buzzing )
-( Woman ) Coming.

677
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:05,208
-( Buzzing Continues )
- Coming.

678
00:55:12,156 --> 00:55:14,090
uh, Mrs. Hardenburg, please.

679
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:18,754
- yes ?
- I am lieutenant Diestl
from your husband's company,

680
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:23,095
and this is a gift
from Captain Hardenburg.

681
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:26,933
Well, come in.

682
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:36,710
oh, yes, of course.
you're the serious one...

683
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,681
in the photograph
with the captain.

684
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,877
- oh, yes, in front of the church ?
- yes.

685
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:43,886
yes.

686
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:46,889
- How do you do ?
- It's a pleasure.

687
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:51,455
He wrote me
you were coming to Berlin.

688
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:55,157
If there was anything
I could do for you and so forth.

689
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:58,065
Well, that's very kind
of the captain.

690
00:55:58,135 --> 00:56:00,069
Please, sit down.

691
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:02,071
Thank you.

692
00:56:04,308 --> 00:56:06,742
Make yourself comfortable.

693
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:10,238
What would you like
to drink ?

694
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:14,717
Perhaps I am intruding here.
you were just going out, no ?

695
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:19,017
only with a general. I'll tell him
I kept him waiting for a lieutenant.

696
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:21,557
Well, in that case, I--

697
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,752
- Vodka ?
- Yes, wonderful.

698
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,761
I have some direct
from the ukraine.

699
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:34,203
And how is the captain ?

700
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:42,038
uh, he's fine. He asked me
to give you his tenderest regards,

701
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:45,343
and to tell you that
he thinks of you constantly.

702
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:48,816
That's very thoughtful of him.

703
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,819
Thank you.

704
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:56,582
And, uh, how is gay Paris ?

705
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,152
Well, gay Paris is not so gay.

706
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,528
oh, that's too bad.

707
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,363
-( Doorbell Buzzing )
- Where are you staying ?

708
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:10,172
As a matter of fact,
I have no accommodations. I was--

709
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,765
you'll find it impossible
to get a hotel room.

710
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:17,303
- Maybe I can do something
for you at the Adelon Hotel.
- oh, that would be wonderful.

711
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:19,315
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

712
00:57:19,383 --> 00:57:21,317
of course.

713
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:28,724
All right, Franz.
Tell him I'll be right down.

714
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:34,022
Are you in a hurry
to get someplace ?

715
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:38,267
uh, no.

716
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:41,964
Then stay.
I won't be too long.

717
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,439
And I want to talk to you
about the captain.

718
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:46,442
Will you ?

719
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:49,812
yes.

720
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,905
Wonderful.

721
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:55,918
Have another drink, lieutenant.
Take some caviar.

722
00:57:55,986 --> 00:57:59,080
See how the home front suffers.

723
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:01,750
-Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

724
00:58:56,876 --> 00:59:01,813
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Don't disturb yourself

725
00:59:19,131 --> 00:59:21,429
I hope you were not
too bored.

726
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,867
No. I wasn't
bored at all.

727
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:30,239
As a matter of fact,
I found a wonderful companion.

728
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,507
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink ?

729
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,481
oh, sure.

730
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,485
I offer you a drink.

731
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,415
oh, that's too much.

732
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:49,661
Enough.

733
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:07,705
It couldn't have been a very interesting
evening for a soldier on leave.

734
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,450
Well, I am, uh--

735
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,320
I'm not a soldier.
I'm a...

736
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:20,359
policeman.

737
01:00:20,426 --> 01:00:23,293
And you don't
find this interesting ?

738
01:00:25,564 --> 01:00:27,498
uh-uh.

739
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,636
Well, cheer up.

740
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:34,229
Things may be different.

741
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:38,300
I have a friend
on Rommel's staff.

742
01:00:38,377 --> 01:00:41,869
Maybe he can be helpful.

743
01:00:41,947 --> 01:00:44,609
Wait.

744
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,981
you-- you can do this ?

745
01:00:47,053 --> 01:00:50,750
you can arrange
military transfers ?

746
01:00:53,592 --> 01:00:56,823
With a small effort.

747
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:07,872
** ( Ends )

748
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,774
** ( Soft )

749
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:20,785
How are the girls in Paris ?

750
01:01:20,853 --> 01:01:24,653
oh, French.

751
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:31,129
Very patriotic.

752
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:37,126
Welcome to Germany,
soldier.

753
01:02:02,795 --> 01:02:04,729
Get me a cigarette, please.

754
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:07,493
- Hmm ?
- Oh the table.

755
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:25,743
- Good morning.
- Morning.

756
01:03:25,811 --> 01:03:28,109
- I hear your show's going just great.
- It's a lulu.

757
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,513
- Brandy and soda.
-Si, signore.

758
01:03:33,085 --> 01:03:36,020
Can you spare it ?

759
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:39,148
- What's the matter ?
- Nothing.

760
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:43,457
oh, come on, Michael. you can usually
fake an affectionate kiss at lunchtime.

761
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:46,794
Something fell through in Washington,
and I have to take basic training.

762
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:49,129
oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

763
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,726
I wasn't supposed to leave
until tomorrow, but I can go now.

764
01:03:51,804 --> 01:03:55,797
- I'm sorry.
- Now that's better.

765
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:59,037
- Why don't you take the afternoon off?
- oh, I can't, Michael.

766
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:03,480
The office of War Information
can spare you on my last afternoon.

767
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:07,451
- We'll see each other tonight.
- Tell 'em you're involved
in a troop movement.

768
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:09,453
No, Michael.
I can't.

769
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:12,012
on the house.
This is the last of the cognac.

770
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:15,458
I bet they still have
plenty in Italy.

771
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:18,087
I came here in 1 92 4, sir.

772
01:04:18,163 --> 01:04:21,496
I don't know anything
about Italy anymore.

773
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:25,003
- That was pretty unnecessary.
- Not the way I feel.

774
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,905
Margaret, what do
you want from me ?

775
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:33,308
I want you
to act like a man.

776
01:04:35,614 --> 01:04:39,983
I want to be proud of you,
the way Hope is proud of Noah.

777
01:04:40,052 --> 01:04:42,816
you want me to get shot.
look, I've read all the books.

778
01:04:42,888 --> 01:04:46,346
I know that in ten years we'll be bosom
friends with the Germans and Japanese.

779
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,393
Then I'll be pretty annoyed
that I was killed.

780
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:54,430
look, Michael, I don't
want you to get shot !

781
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,766
I don't-- I don't even mind
your wanting to get out of the army.

782
01:04:58,837 --> 01:05:02,796
I just want you to stop pretending
that you think it's all right.

783
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:05,639
- Is that all ?
- No.

784
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:10,977
I want us to go someplace
and get married.

785
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:15,316
- Now ?
- Mm-hmm.

786
01:05:15,387 --> 01:05:18,720
look, honey, I love you,
but today ?

787
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,782
Now you've been seeing
too many war pictures.

788
01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:26,428
- you mean no ?
- I could be in for years.

789
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:33,638
- last chance, Michael.
- oh, honey, that'd be foolish.

790
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,942
oh, I almost forgot.

791
01:05:42,014 --> 01:05:45,575
The office is
sending me overseas.

792
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:48,779
I was gonna
tell you that tonight.

793
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:09,202
- oh, hello, Mrs. Ackerman,
Mr. Ackerman.
- Hello.

794
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:11,538
-Rather early this morning, aren't you ?
-yes, we are.

795
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:15,102
- Well, today's the day, eh ?
- yes, it is.

796
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,583
Here. Give you courage.
Calm the nerves.

797
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:21,619
Go ahead. Drink it.

798
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:25,054
It's full of cream.
Homogenized.

799
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,987
- Good, isn't it ?
- yes, it is.

800
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:33,327
I drink two quarts
a day myself. Keeps me young.

801
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:35,993
Well, I've got to be
on my way. Good luck.

802
01:06:36,068 --> 01:06:38,002
Thank you.

803
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:55,343
oh, you taste good.

804
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:57,355
I love you.

805
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:07,656
- ( Whispering ) Are you ready ?
-Jawohl.

01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:12,590

807
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:14,598
Kraus.

808
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,104
yeah.

809
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:52,368
They're all ready, sir.

810
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:54,769
All right, Leutnant.

811
01:08:58,877 --> 01:09:01,812
- Now.
- May I suggest we wait, sir ?

812
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,396
Wait ? Why ?

813
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:07,397
over your shoulder, sir.
The sun will be up in a few moments.

814
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:09,957
And when the sun is up
and in their eyes,

815
01:09:10,036 --> 01:09:12,300
their guns will be
completely useless.

816
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,740
A wonderful idea.
We will wait.

817
01:10:22,108 --> 01:10:24,872
Morter.

818
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:30,741
Machine guns.

819
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,649
Fire. Quick !

Kraus, left !

825
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:08,936
All right.
Cease fire !

( Gunfire Stops )

828
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:16,287
I gave no order
to stop firing.

829
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:19,085
What are you doing,
oberleutnant ?

830
01:12:20,626 --> 01:12:24,255
The machine guns will continue
to rake the area for 60 seconds.

831
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:29,033
- Fire!

Shoot all wounded.

834
01:13:45,277 --> 01:13:47,370
leave no one alive here.

835
01:13:47,446 --> 01:13:50,711
We cannot take prisoners.

836
01:13:50,783 --> 01:13:53,775
our movements must
not be reported.

837
01:13:53,852 --> 01:13:55,786
These wounded can
give information,

838
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:59,017
and their planes would be
on us before we got back.

839
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:03,585
Then all our reconnaissance,
useless.

840
01:14:03,662 --> 01:14:05,755
Proceed.

01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:02,553
Shoot him !

845
01:15:09,628 --> 01:15:11,653

Attention !

851
01:16:24,436 --> 01:16:26,927
At ease.

Wipe that smile
off your face, Whiteacre.

855
01:16:54,433 --> 01:16:56,367
you're not
a Broadway big shot now.

856

come in here.

This isn't the New y ork
Public library, soldier.

863
01:17:44,783 --> 01:17:47,217
I know this book.
It's a filthy, dirty book.

01:17:47,286 --> 01:17:50,881
The army doesn't care
what you read, but I do.

865
01:17:50,956 --> 01:17:53,481
Get rid of it.
Eyes front.

866
01:17:55,961 --> 01:17:58,896
All right, soldier.

867

This window hasn't
been cleaned at all.

868

is unmilitary.

Sergeant, these quarters aren't ready
for inspection. Get them ready.

yes, sir.

one sloppy soldier in the outfit,

punishing the entire platoon--
- No, lieutenant.

gone and done it.

880

Now I'm gonna have to take you
under my personal wing.

This ain't no crummy tenement
in the Bronx.

882
01:19:09,868 --> 01:19:12,632
- Now wait a minute, Sergeant.
- Keep your mouth shut.

01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:14,638
When I want you to talk,
I'll ask you a direct question.

you'll answer yes or no.
That's an order.

And you know what ?

888
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:29,382
you're gonna wash every window
in this barracks.

889
01:19:29,454 --> 01:19:31,854
you're gonna wash 'em
until they're clean,

- language ?

- ( All ) oh, sure !

look at the dough he could
be makin' sellin' black-market
tires and gasoline...

- oh, forget it.
- you're right.

in the service anyway ?

at the P.X.

I'll go with you.

- I want everything to be
absolutely correct.

arrange it. I might lose my temper.

So ?

944
01:24:23,582 --> 01:24:25,709
What do you weigh ?

945
01:24:25,784 --> 01:24:28,514
Never mind what I weigh.

946
01:24:28,587 --> 01:24:30,521
A hundred and thirty-five.

947
01:24:30,589 --> 01:24:34,855
look, they're only needling you because
you had them confined to the post.

948
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:38,226
Will you arrange
the schedule ?

949
01:24:38,297 --> 01:24:40,925
okay. you don't want
to help, don't help.

950

What schedule ?

951
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:46,027
you want me to fight
all four guys in one night ?

952
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:48,038
you're crazy.

953
01:24:48,106 --> 01:24:50,438
I don't want to have anything
to do with this. Now take it.

954

Well, you asked for it.

960
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:03,070
Teach him a little bit about boxing.
Nope. look out. look out.

961
01:26:03,148 --> 01:26:05,548
Come on, Burnecker.
Finish 'im.

962
01:26:05,617 --> 01:26:07,551
oh, oh, look.

963
01:26:10,322 --> 01:26:12,722
- lay it into him, Burnie.
- okay, Burnie. Knock him on his back.

964

-Ah, don't kill 'im. oh, not yet anyway.
-Give him a one, two.

fight anymore. Come on, Burnie !

He's goin' down. Ah, look out now.

to keep those windows clean.

I'm sure you're not aware of it,
Captain, but Private Ackerman
has been badly beaten...

in fights with the biggest men
in the company.

01:27:30,302 --> 01:27:32,236
yes ?

976
01:27:32,304 --> 01:27:36,638
He's been seriously hurt,
and I'm sure now that you know,
you'll want to stop it.

977
01:27:38,043 --> 01:27:40,102
you're quite right,
Whiteacre.

978
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:44,672
If I knew, I would stop it.
I'd be obliged to stop it.
But then, I don't know.

979
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,741
you know now, sir.

980
01:27:51,156 --> 01:27:53,181
What's the matter with you ?

981
01:27:53,258 --> 01:27:56,853
Ackerman isn't one of
those rich Broadway producers
you have to suck around.

982
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,862
He's just a dogface.
Get some sense.

983
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:01,763
I think you'll have
to stop it, sir.

984
01:28:07,973 --> 01:28:12,842
you know, the colonel had
a phone call about you out
of channels from Washington--

985
01:28:12,911 --> 01:28:15,038
very much out of channels--

986
01:28:15,113 --> 01:28:19,106
to transfer you
to special service in london.

987
01:28:19,184 --> 01:28:21,118
It's up to me to approve it
or disapprove it.

988
01:28:22,954 --> 01:28:26,856
I still think you'll have to
stop it, sir. I know the colonel would.

989
01:28:31,229 --> 01:28:35,188
All right, Whiteacre.
I'll spell it out for you.

990
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:38,532
you go to the colonel
and you won't get your transfer.

991
01:28:38,603 --> 01:28:43,472
you'll have to be fives times
more soldier than any man in
this outfit just to stay alive.

992
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,476
Now get out.

993
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:53,083
Rickett.

994
01:28:58,423 --> 01:29:02,086
Get rid of'im... today.

995
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,994
- Send his papers through.
- yes, sir.

996

( Michael )
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

997
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,658
- This makes three beatings in a row.
- I almost had him though.

998
01:29:13,138 --> 01:29:15,766
- How'd he look ? yeah.
- Who ? Cowley ?

999
01:29:15,841 --> 01:29:18,105
Better than you do.

1000
01:29:18,176 --> 01:29:22,306
- What are you trying to prove ?
- Nothin'.

1001
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:27,147
- Well, why are you tryin'
to kill yourself?
- I like to fight.

1002
01:29:27,219 --> 01:29:30,347
Well, I'm tired of watching
you get your brains beat out.

1003
01:29:30,422 --> 01:29:33,482
look, if you fight Brailsford,
you're on your own.

1004
01:29:33,558 --> 01:29:35,492
- ( Gasps )
- Sorry.

1005
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,222
That's okay.
That's all right.

1006
01:29:38,296 --> 01:29:40,389
Michael,
I can lick Brailsford.

1007
01:29:40,465 --> 01:29:42,399
Well, I don't care.

1008
01:29:42,467 --> 01:29:44,867
It's important to me.
It's the last fight.

1009
01:29:44,936 --> 01:29:47,871
- you're crazy. This whole thing
has got you crazy.
- Maybe.

1010
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:51,602
- oh, excuse me, men ?
- yes, lieutenant ?

1011
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:54,975
- I'd like to speak with Ackerman.
- Certainly, sir.

1012
01:29:57,282 --> 01:29:59,182
you'll be around ?

1013
01:30:00,485 --> 01:30:03,318
Mm-hmm.

1014
01:30:04,389 --> 01:30:06,448
Cigarette ?

1015
01:30:06,525 --> 01:30:08,459
Thanks.

1016
01:30:11,096 --> 01:30:13,758
oh. Sorry.

1017
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:17,427
Ackerman, I've been
watching the sick book.

1018
01:30:17,502 --> 01:30:23,065
In my opinion, you're the most
accident-prone soldier in the
entire united States Infantry.

1019
01:30:23,141 --> 01:30:25,837
I'm careless, sir.

1020
01:30:25,911 --> 01:30:28,573
Saturday nights in town
you're careless.

1021
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:30,581
Every Saturday night.

1022
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:33,311
on weekdays, you run the roughest
obstacle course on the post...

1023
01:30:33,385 --> 01:30:36,377
without stubbing your toe.

1024
01:30:36,454 --> 01:30:38,388
Now why don't
you level with me ?

1025
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:41,357
I know you're fighting.
I think I know why.

1026
01:30:43,228 --> 01:30:45,753
This is something
for the colonel to handle.

1027
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,094
Just give me the word.

1028
01:30:49,834 --> 01:30:52,962
Besides, you're getting licked.
you're no good to us punch-drunk.

1029
01:30:53,038 --> 01:30:56,303
( Exhales )
I appreciate it, lieutenant. Thank you.

1030
01:30:56,374 --> 01:30:58,433
But this is my business.

1031
01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:01,843
- Whiteacre ?
- yeah ?

1032
01:31:01,913 --> 01:31:05,405
I've been looking all over the post
for you. your orders just came through.

1033
01:31:05,483 --> 01:31:08,077
you've got 40 minutes
to make the train to Washington.

1034
01:31:08,153 --> 01:31:10,087
Thanks.

1035
01:31:14,993 --> 01:31:16,927
He's all yours, medic.

1036
01:32:30,602 --> 01:32:34,368
Don't fall ! Don't fall !
Don't fall ! Don't fall !

1037
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:36,373
Don't fall !

1038
01:32:57,962 --> 01:32:59,896
Come on.

1039
01:33:21,252 --> 01:33:23,516
Now leave it alone.

1040
01:33:23,588 --> 01:33:26,022
you'll get dirt in it.

1041
01:33:30,295 --> 01:33:32,320
Ready ! Hut !

1042
01:33:32,397 --> 01:33:34,388
Ready ! Hut !

1043
01:33:34,466 --> 01:33:36,400
Ready ! Hut !

1044
01:33:36,468 --> 01:33:38,595
Attention roll call !

1045
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:40,604
- Abbott ?
-( Abbott ) Here!

1046
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:42,606
- Acaro ?
-( Acaro ) Here!

1047
01:33:42,674 --> 01:33:45,108
Ackerman ?

1048
01:33:45,176 --> 01:33:47,110
Ackerman!

1049
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:52,448
Any of you men
seen Ackerman ?

1050
01:34:00,925 --> 01:34:05,123
Abbott, did Ackerman sleep
in his bunk last night ?

1051
01:34:05,196 --> 01:34:07,756
I don't know, sir.
I didn't notice.

1052
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:16,198
Donnelly, did he ?

1053
01:34:16,274 --> 01:34:18,401
Eyes front, you.

1054
01:34:18,476 --> 01:34:21,036
Well, Donnelly ?

1055
01:34:21,112 --> 01:34:24,309
I don't know, sir. He's at
the opposite end of the barracks.

1056
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:28,351
I warn you, men.

1057
01:34:28,419 --> 01:34:32,321
I want a straight answer
from the next solider. Cowley !

1058
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:38,093
No, sir.
He didn't.

1059
01:34:39,831 --> 01:34:43,267
Nobody deserts this company !

1060
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:47,563
When they find 'im,
I don't want him in a stockade.

1061
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:50,107
I want him right back here.

1062
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:53,372
- He's mine.
- yes, sir.

1063
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:11,895
Gentlemen,
your attention please !

1064
01:35:11,963 --> 01:35:14,727
The briefing will begin.

1065
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,933
Gentlemen.

1066
01:35:24,008 --> 01:35:26,704
I will come directly
and frankly to the point.

1067
01:35:26,778 --> 01:35:31,181
you have heard rumors that
our position is deteriorating.

1068
01:35:31,249 --> 01:35:33,183
It is.

1069
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:35,742
An American invasion fleet
of tremendous strength...

1070
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:40,189
is believed to be approaching Tunisia
to attack us from the rear.

1071
01:35:40,258 --> 01:35:44,251
The British are about to launch
a massive frontal offensive.

1072
01:35:44,329 --> 01:35:46,263
The resistance at Stalingrad...

1073
01:35:46,331 --> 01:35:51,030
has bled off fuel and ammunition
in unexpected quantities.

1074
01:35:51,102 --> 01:35:55,061
We must, therefore,
prepare for a breakthrough.

1075
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:57,733
( Airplane Engine Droning )

1076
01:35:57,809 --> 01:36:01,506
For the present, this
information is for you only.

1077
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:03,706
( Man )
Air attack!

1078
01:36:03,781 --> 01:36:05,715
Dismissed.

1079
01:36:16,661 --> 01:36:18,595

1080
01:36:23,468 --> 01:36:26,665

1081
01:36:43,812 --> 01:36:45,746

1083

( Gunfire )

1084
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:04,082
- Damn you ! Keep awake !
- I am awake.

1085
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:08,255
Well, you stay that way !
Talk to me !

1086
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:10,992
See that you don't
fall asleep !

1087
01:38:13,035 --> 01:38:18,837
- What do you want me to say ?
- Anything. Anything.Just talk.

1088
01:38:18,907 --> 01:38:21,307
All right.

1089
01:38:21,377 --> 01:38:24,904
How far-- How far do
we have to go now ?

1090
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:29,644
About 400 kilometers more.

1091
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,384
Seven hours !

1092
01:38:38,994 --> 01:38:41,986
I think I must sleep.

1093
01:38:42,064 --> 01:38:45,500
If you sleep, you'll wake up
in a British prison camp.

1094
01:38:45,567 --> 01:38:49,298
Come on ! Talk !

1095
01:38:49,371 --> 01:38:52,772
I wish I was
in the mountains...

1096
01:38:52,841 --> 01:38:57,210
where it's so cool
and peaceful in the snow,

1097
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:00,407
so wonderful to feel
the wind in your face,

1098
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:03,417
clean and nice.

1099
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:06,784
And I like the smell
of smoke in the winter...

1100
01:39:06,855 --> 01:39:10,791
coming from the wood...
in the fireplaces.

1101
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:13,953
Talk about something else !
Talk about women !

1102
01:39:14,029 --> 01:39:17,521
Women ! Women !

1103
01:39:17,599 --> 01:39:23,333
I have a French girl, Francoise,
and I think I can love her.

1104
01:39:23,405 --> 01:39:27,569
- Was she beautiful ?
- yes, she was beautiful.

1105
01:39:27,643 --> 01:39:30,407
And I wish I was with her...

1106
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:33,414
and not on this motorcycle...

1107
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:35,450
because I am--

1108
01:39:35,517 --> 01:39:37,985
I am sick of Africa !

1109
01:39:38,053 --> 01:39:41,682
And I am sick of
the great German army.

1110
01:39:41,757 --> 01:39:44,453
And I am sick of
doing my duty.

1111
01:39:44,526 --> 01:39:46,687
I should have shot you.

1112
01:39:46,762 --> 01:39:50,357
- What ?
- I said I should have shot you !

1113
01:39:50,432 --> 01:39:52,627
I ought to shoot you now !

1114
01:39:52,701 --> 01:39:55,568
you'd better learn
to drive this first.

1115
01:39:55,637 --> 01:39:57,571
you will destroy us !

1116
01:39:57,639 --> 01:40:00,130
Men like you
poison an army !

1117
01:40:00,209 --> 01:40:02,769
you let discipline slip
a little one day...

1118
01:40:02,845 --> 01:40:06,110
and a little more the next day
and soon you're nothing !

1119
01:40:06,181 --> 01:40:09,617
you are not able to fight at all !
I should have shot you !

1120
01:40:09,685 --> 01:40:12,620
- Why didn't you shoot me then ?
- Because I was an idiot !

1121
01:40:12,688 --> 01:40:16,124
yes ! you recognize it ! Ja.

1122
01:40:16,191 --> 01:40:20,059
you are still infected with
a little decent human feelings !

1123
01:40:20,129 --> 01:40:22,996
- oh, shut up ! Shut up !
- And you hate that in yourself,
don't you ?

1124
01:40:23,065 --> 01:40:26,000
- Shut up !
- you hate it in yourself--

1125
01:41:12,915 --> 01:41:14,849
( No Audio )

1126
01:41:16,218 --> 01:41:18,152
( Whispers )
What ?

1127
01:41:19,855 --> 01:41:21,914
Hello.

1128
01:41:26,428 --> 01:41:28,988
I want to kiss you.

1129
01:41:33,001 --> 01:41:35,367
Why didn't you tell me ?

1130
01:41:37,873 --> 01:41:39,966
I couldn't.

1131
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:44,308
Besides, there is a law against
harboring deserters.

1132
01:41:44,379 --> 01:41:46,643
you're not a deserter.

1133
01:41:46,715 --> 01:41:49,707
The army knows you told me
you gave yourself up.

1134
01:41:53,388 --> 01:41:56,016
you all right ?

1135
01:41:56,091 --> 01:41:58,025
yes.

1136
01:42:00,395 --> 01:42:03,387
Noah,

1137
01:42:03,465 --> 01:42:07,765
you know what
they're asking me to do ?

1138
01:42:07,836 --> 01:42:09,770
Sure. Sure.

1139
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:16,736
The lawyer says if you go back
to your own company,

1140
01:42:16,812 --> 01:42:19,246
you won't go to prison.

1141
01:42:20,282 --> 01:42:22,250
Mm-hmm.

1142
01:42:22,317 --> 01:42:26,845
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
you do what you have to.

1143
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,329
Hope, stand up.

1144
01:42:36,598 --> 01:42:38,532
Stand up.

1145
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:48,407
Honey, how long is it ?

1146
01:42:48,477 --> 01:42:51,105
- What ?
- How long is it ?

1147
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:54,273
- Five months.
- Five months !

1148
01:42:54,349 --> 01:42:56,647
Why didn't you tell me ?

1149
01:42:56,718 --> 01:42:59,118
I could've written you,
I guess.

1150
01:42:59,187 --> 01:43:03,055
I had to work
this out myself.

1151
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:06,219
The doctor said I should stay
in bed for a while.

1152
01:43:06,295 --> 01:43:08,525
I did.

1153
01:43:08,597 --> 01:43:11,794
I guess that's why
I didn't write to you.

1154
01:43:13,368 --> 01:43:16,769
I wanted to make sure
it would be all right.

1155
01:43:19,241 --> 01:43:22,301
I don't want this to influence you
one way or the other.

1156
01:43:24,846 --> 01:43:27,781
Are you glad ?

1157
01:43:30,385 --> 01:43:33,081
It's wonderful.

1158
01:43:33,155 --> 01:43:35,817
Absolutely... wonderful.

1159
01:43:35,891 --> 01:43:37,825
Time's up.

1160
01:43:37,893 --> 01:43:40,987
Don't worry about me.
I'm going back home.

1161
01:43:41,063 --> 01:43:42,997
Don't worry at all.

1162
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,959
I'm not worried.

1163
01:43:49,638 --> 01:43:52,163
Can you imagine ?

1164
01:43:53,608 --> 01:43:56,702
listen.
Go to the lawyer,

1165
01:43:56,778 --> 01:44:00,976
and tell him I'll go
anyplace they want to send me.

1166
01:44:01,049 --> 01:44:03,347
- All right, soldier.
- 'Kay ?

1167
01:44:09,024 --> 01:44:12,482
( Whispering )
I love you.

1168
01:44:24,473 --> 01:44:26,407
Not only are you a disgrace
to the army, Ackerman,

1169
01:44:26,475 --> 01:44:28,739
but your actions have caused a black
mark to be made against this company...

1170
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:31,472
and against me personally.

1171
01:44:31,546 --> 01:44:34,515
I'm gonna see that
you erase that black mark.

1172
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:38,417
I'm gonna make a soldier out of you
if I have to break you in half to do it.

1173
01:44:38,487 --> 01:44:40,978
yes, sir.

1174
01:44:41,056 --> 01:44:42,990
you'll get no passes.

1175
01:44:43,058 --> 01:44:46,186
you'll be on K.P.
every day for the next week.

1176
01:44:47,629 --> 01:44:50,598
Also you'll have the same cot
and the same men around you.

1177
01:44:50,665 --> 01:44:54,829
You're going to have to make
mighty sure any punishments
handed out to them...

1178
01:44:54,903 --> 01:44:57,599
-aren't caused by you.
- yes, sir.

1179
01:45:00,509 --> 01:45:03,000
Now get out of here. I don't want
to see you in this orderly room again.

1180
01:45:03,078 --> 01:45:06,639
yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

1181
01:45:12,888 --> 01:45:15,755
( Door Closes )

1182
01:45:15,824 --> 01:45:18,122
- ( Man on Intercom ) Captain ?
- yes ?

1183
01:45:18,193 --> 01:45:22,254
This is Major Price. The colonel
requests that you report to his office.

1184
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:24,821
I'll be right there, Major.

1185
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,901
you wish to see me, sir.

1186
01:45:40,549 --> 01:45:44,485
There are many kinds of officers
that we get in a war,

1187
01:45:44,553 --> 01:45:48,045
men like Green, Emerson...

1188
01:45:48,123 --> 01:45:50,057
and a few officers like you.

1189
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:55,654
Fortunately,
a very few like you.

1190
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:59,291
Sometimes we find you out.
Occasionally we don't.

1191
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:03,360
In your case,
we've been lucky.

1192
01:46:03,438 --> 01:46:05,463
I've just completed
an investigation...

1193
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:09,306
of the reasons
for Private Ackerman's behavior.

1194
01:46:09,377 --> 01:46:13,108
- Sir, I can explain. you see--
- I hope you can.

1195
01:46:14,683 --> 01:46:16,617
I'll read you the charges
that'll be brought against you...

1196
01:46:16,685 --> 01:46:19,950
at your court-martial.

1197
01:46:20,021 --> 01:46:23,149
''That said officer willfully persecuted
Private Noah Ackerman...

1198
01:46:23,225 --> 01:46:27,355
''by ordering mass punishment
of his entire company
as a means of disciplining him,

1199
01:46:28,964 --> 01:46:31,831
''by willfully and knowingly
permitting savage beatings...

1200
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:35,768
''to be inflicted upon him
by members of his company,

1201
01:46:35,837 --> 01:46:40,706
by attempting to blackmail
Private Michael Whiteacre
who interceded in his behalf.''

1202
01:46:43,178 --> 01:46:45,112
you want me to go on ?

1203
01:46:47,549 --> 01:46:49,608
I thought not.

1204
01:46:49,684 --> 01:46:53,211
I've proffered these charges
against you, and...

1205
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:56,155
I officially serve you
with them now.

1206
01:47:03,131 --> 01:47:05,065
( Man ) Ah,just put your money in.
Never mind the--

1207
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:07,624
How much ? Five bucks.

1208
01:47:07,702 --> 01:47:11,536
Hey ! Hey, you guys.
I think I just seen a ghost.

1209
01:47:13,875 --> 01:47:15,866
( Burnecker )
I don't see anything.

1210
01:47:15,944 --> 01:47:18,003
-( Cowley ) I think it's Ackerman.
-( Abbott ) You're crazy.

1211
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:20,013
Ackerman's in New York
living it up.

1212
01:47:20,081 --> 01:47:22,140
( Cowley ) If it isn't Ackerman,
it's somebody who looks like Ackerman.

1213
01:47:22,217 --> 01:47:25,643
- ( Donnelly )
Nobody looks like Ackerman.
- ( Burnecker laughs )

1214
01:48:00,978 --> 01:48:03,845
( Donnelly ) All right. Don't just
sit there. Make room for one more.

1215
01:48:03,914 --> 01:48:06,940
I've just found a pigeon
with 20 bucks.

1216
01:48:07,017 --> 01:48:10,145
-( Man #1 )
Okay. Come on. Who's bettin'?
-( Man #2 ) King and queen.

1217
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:12,211
Five. You're out of your mind.

1218
01:48:28,272 --> 01:48:31,207
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Captain.
May I help you ?

1219
01:48:31,275 --> 01:48:34,676
yes, uh, do you have
a Captain Hardenburg in this section ?

1220
01:48:34,745 --> 01:48:38,181
- yes, he's here.
- Would it be possible to see him ?

1221
01:48:38,248 --> 01:48:41,046
- Are you a friend of his ?
- Mmm. yes.

1222
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:43,382
Very good. He's right in there.
Go right in.

1223
01:48:43,454 --> 01:48:45,388
Thank you.

1224
01:48:58,635 --> 01:49:00,694
Captain Hardenburg ?

1225
01:49:00,771 --> 01:49:04,502
- Is that you, Diestl ?
- Yes, sir.

1226
01:49:04,575 --> 01:49:07,100
I was just released
from my hospital this afternoon,

1227
01:49:07,177 --> 01:49:09,577
and I came to say good-bye.

1228
01:49:09,646 --> 01:49:12,171
That's very nice of you.

1229
01:49:12,249 --> 01:49:14,843
Well, are you feeling
any better, sir ?

1230
01:49:14,918 --> 01:49:19,787
- Ah, better each day.
- Good.

1231
01:49:19,857 --> 01:49:23,384
But they tell me
I will be here for six months.

1232
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:26,691
Six months. Ah, well, I'm sorry
that it will be so long for you.

1233
01:49:26,764 --> 01:49:28,891
oh, why sorry ?

1234
01:49:28,966 --> 01:49:33,460
It gives me the opportunity
to think of the future.

1235
01:49:33,537 --> 01:49:37,940
- I plan to go into politics.
- oh, yes.

1236
01:49:38,008 --> 01:49:43,878
My face will be a reminder of what
I have given for the fatherland.

1237
01:49:43,947 --> 01:49:46,438
It will stand me
in good stead...

1238
01:49:46,517 --> 01:49:49,486
before audiences
at public meetings.

1239
01:49:49,553 --> 01:49:52,579
Well,

1240
01:49:52,656 --> 01:49:54,886
you know, sir, that...

1241
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:57,620
they do remarkable things
nowadays with--

1242
01:49:57,694 --> 01:50:01,357
yes, remarkable.
Remarkable.

1243
01:50:01,432 --> 01:50:05,459
Glass eyes,
plastic noses,

1244
01:50:05,536 --> 01:50:09,472
reconstructed cheekbones.

1245
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:12,907
I have written to Gretchen
in this kind of detail...

1246
01:50:12,976 --> 01:50:16,104
to prepare her for it.

1247
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:19,616
And she has assured me
she is proud of me,

1248
01:50:19,683 --> 01:50:22,811
and it will
make no difference.

1249
01:50:22,886 --> 01:50:25,650
Gretchen is
the name of my wife.

1250
01:50:25,722 --> 01:50:28,316
yes, I know.

1251
01:50:28,392 --> 01:50:31,054
How do you know ?

1252
01:50:33,063 --> 01:50:36,726
Oh,yes. You delivered
a package for me.

1253
01:50:38,001 --> 01:50:41,437
She's quite handsome,
isn't she ?

1254
01:50:41,505 --> 01:50:44,702
yes, sir.
She's quite handsome.

1255
01:50:44,775 --> 01:50:46,709
She will be very useful
to my career.

1256
01:50:48,645 --> 01:50:51,443
What I would like
for you to do for me is...

1257
01:50:51,515 --> 01:50:55,849
visit her again...
to reassure her.

1258
01:50:57,921 --> 01:51:00,947
I know it's
a great deal to ask,

1259
01:51:01,024 --> 01:51:06,087
to speak for a man to his wife
under these circumstances,

1260
01:51:06,163 --> 01:51:10,463
but I want her to hear
from a third party that I am...

1261
01:51:10,534 --> 01:51:12,468
salvageable.

1262
01:51:14,905 --> 01:51:17,601
yes, I-I-I will be
glad to do that.

1263
01:51:17,674 --> 01:51:21,303
Thank you.
Thank you, Diestl.

1264
01:51:22,913 --> 01:51:26,713
Now, come closer.

1265
01:51:32,222 --> 01:51:34,156
yes, sir.

1266
01:51:35,726 --> 01:51:38,160
Are we alone ?

1267
01:51:40,464 --> 01:51:43,763
- yes, except for--
- yes, it's all right.

1268
01:51:45,102 --> 01:51:48,538
I have one more favor
to ask of you.

1269
01:51:48,605 --> 01:51:51,699
I want you to bring me
a bayonet.

1270
01:51:53,443 --> 01:51:57,243
- A bayonet ?
- yes, yes. A bayonet.

1271
01:52:00,083 --> 01:52:03,348
- Well, I think, uh--
- W-What is the matter with you ?

1272
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,547
Not for me.

1273
01:52:05,622 --> 01:52:07,556
For him.

1274
01:52:09,459 --> 01:52:12,826
He has no hands left...
or anything left.

1275
01:52:12,896 --> 01:52:14,830
He wants to die.

1276
01:52:14,898 --> 01:52:17,731
I've promised him.

1277
01:52:17,801 --> 01:52:21,498
( Whispering )
He whispers to me... when we are alone.

1278
01:52:21,572 --> 01:52:23,506
And he can hear.

1279
01:52:28,178 --> 01:52:31,443
He's a watchmaker...
in Nuremberg.

1280
01:52:31,515 --> 01:52:34,006
He specializes
in stopwatches.

1281
01:52:34,084 --> 01:52:38,020
He has three children,
and he wants to die.

1282
01:52:55,772 --> 01:52:59,401
Where is my hand ?

1283
01:52:59,476 --> 01:53:02,445
Approximately over his heart.

1284
01:53:02,512 --> 01:53:04,503
Good.

1285
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:07,812
That's where I will place
the bayonet.

1286
01:53:07,884 --> 01:53:12,287
We have practiced it
every night for a week.

1287
01:53:12,356 --> 01:53:14,984
Come back tonight
with the bayonet.

1288
01:53:28,105 --> 01:53:31,939
Diestl, will you bring me
the bayonet ?

1289
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:35,844
yes, sir.

1290
01:53:40,617 --> 01:53:42,676
Good-bye, Diestl.

1291
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:52,726
Good-bye, sir.

1292
01:55:36,533 --> 01:55:40,401
-( Gretchen ) Yes ?
- It's Christian Diestl.

1293
01:55:42,038 --> 01:55:44,632
Who ?

1294
01:55:44,708 --> 01:55:47,609
Christian Diestl.

1295
01:55:53,784 --> 01:55:58,278
- Hello ?
- oh, the lieutenant.

1296
01:55:58,355 --> 01:56:01,188
- yes.
- Come in.

1297
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:09,121
How are you ?

1298
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:12,726
I'm all right.
And you ?

1299
01:56:12,803 --> 01:56:14,737
Forgive me, lieutenant.
I must look awful,

1300
01:56:14,805 --> 01:56:16,966
but I haven't slept
for so many weeks.

1301
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,907
- We've had so many air raids.
- Mmm.

1302
01:56:21,411 --> 01:56:24,574
Come in.
Excuse me.

1303
01:56:24,648 --> 01:56:27,446
They come over
two or three times a night.

1304
01:56:27,517 --> 01:56:30,247
you can't imagine
what it's like.

1305
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:33,255
The soldiers at the front
would strike under such conditions.

1306
01:56:34,658 --> 01:56:36,592
I mean it.

1307
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:39,094
There's no heat,
no light.

1308
01:56:47,771 --> 01:56:51,605
oh, yes.
I remember.

1309
01:56:51,675 --> 01:56:54,200
Sit down.

1310
01:56:54,277 --> 01:56:56,211
Thank you.

1311
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:04,153
Did you bring any food
from Russia ?

1312
01:57:06,456 --> 01:57:08,583
- Africa.
- Of course.

1313
01:57:08,658 --> 01:57:10,888
- My husband's company.
- yeah.

1314
01:57:12,262 --> 01:57:15,629
All I have left
is some kummel.

1315
01:57:17,334 --> 01:57:19,734
No thanks.

1316
01:57:19,803 --> 01:57:22,931
Do you hear from
your husband ?

1317
01:57:24,374 --> 01:57:26,308
He killed himself.

1318
01:57:30,881 --> 01:57:35,113
- He what ?
- He killed himself with a bayonet.

1319
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,915
I have the letter somewhere.

1320
01:57:56,673 --> 01:57:59,301
He asked me to come here
and speak to you for him.

1321
01:58:01,978 --> 01:58:04,606
Perhaps it's just as well.

1322
01:58:07,417 --> 01:58:10,386
He wanted to come back here.

1323
01:58:11,621 --> 01:58:13,612
Naturally,
I didn't encourage him.

1324
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:17,387
I spent a whole night
composing a most tactful letter.

1325
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:22,454
I told him, of course,
he would be better off in some
permanent veteran's hospital.

1326
01:58:26,136 --> 01:58:28,331
What are you doing now ?

1327
01:58:28,405 --> 01:58:32,034
For heaven's sake, Christian,
be a little realistic.

1328
01:58:32,108 --> 01:58:34,838
you people are getting
stranger and stranger.

1329
01:58:39,149 --> 01:58:42,516
Stay a little while.

1330
01:58:42,586 --> 01:58:45,783
Maybe I can find some vodka.

1331
01:58:49,993 --> 01:58:54,589
I make myself
pretty for you.

1332
01:59:14,751 --> 01:59:16,685
( Brandt )
Christian ?

1333
01:59:18,488 --> 01:59:21,082
Christian !

1334
01:59:21,157 --> 01:59:23,352
Brandt.

1335
01:59:23,426 --> 01:59:26,520
Christian, how wonderful
to see you again.

1336
01:59:26,596 --> 01:59:29,531
It's good to see you,
Brandt.

1337
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:32,295
- ( Chuckles ) oh, no.
- I can't believe it.

1338
01:59:32,369 --> 01:59:34,735
( laughing )

1339
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,204
oh, it was bad, huh ?

1340
01:59:40,276 --> 01:59:44,303
No. They moved us around
a little bit, but you know, it's--

1341
01:59:44,381 --> 01:59:46,315
listen now, uh,

1342
01:59:46,383 --> 01:59:48,874
what's the matter with you,
being so near the front ?

1343
01:59:48,952 --> 01:59:52,979
Well, you know me.
It was a mistake in the orders.

1344
01:59:53,056 --> 01:59:54,990
But you, what are you doing here ?
Are you stationed here ?

1345
01:59:55,058 --> 01:59:59,893
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm waiting for transportation.
I'm trying to get to Paris.

1346
01:59:59,963 --> 02:00:02,796
let's go someplace where
we can talk. I'll buy you
a drink for old-time's sake.

1347
02:00:02,866 --> 02:00:04,834
Brandt, I see you are
a captain from taking pictures.

1348
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:08,268
It's an outrage.
I should be a major.

1349
02:00:08,338 --> 02:00:12,434
you have no idea
how glad I am to see you.

1350
02:00:12,509 --> 02:00:15,808
I'll take that.
Bring us some glasses.

1351
02:00:15,879 --> 02:00:19,440
I've been hanging around here
for two days waiting for
somebody to go to Paris.

1352
02:00:19,516 --> 02:00:23,885
- listen. What are you
doing in Paris, Brandt ?
- Well, my headquarters are there.

1353
02:00:23,953 --> 02:00:27,980
This is your headquarters with
the blond hair who likes goose liver ?

1354
02:00:28,058 --> 02:00:31,050
( laughing )
yeah, yeah. That's the one.

1355
02:00:31,127 --> 02:00:33,459
In other words,
you have no orders whatsoever.

1356
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:35,464
- only a desire.
- yeah, yeah.

1357
02:00:35,532 --> 02:00:39,992
look, Christian, I have also managed to
acquire a little French car all my own.

1358
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:42,004
- Well, this follows, naturally.
- yes, but look.

1359
02:00:42,072 --> 02:00:45,838
A poor, old photographer.
I wouldn't last an hour before
somebody requisitioned it.

1360
02:00:45,909 --> 02:00:50,972
But you have combat orders. With you,
there would be no questions asked.

1361
02:00:51,047 --> 02:00:53,208
you have this car here
with you ?

1362
02:00:53,283 --> 02:00:55,877
yeah,just near here
in a little stable.

1363
02:00:55,952 --> 02:00:58,386
- Why don't we go now ?
We'll take the car.
- All right. let's go.

1364
02:00:58,455 --> 02:01:01,390
Good. Good.

1365
02:01:12,454 --> 02:01:16,447
Why don't you have dinner
with Simone and me tonight, huh ?

1366
02:01:16,525 --> 02:01:20,188
Well, that would be very nice,
but I think I must report.

1367
02:01:20,262 --> 02:01:23,629
oh, report in the morning.
you need some rest.

1368
02:01:23,699 --> 02:01:26,600
Brandt, do you ever
see Francoise ?

1369
02:01:26,668 --> 02:01:29,899
Why, of course.
She is living with Simone now.

1370
02:01:31,874 --> 02:01:33,808
She is living
with Simone ?

1371
02:01:33,876 --> 02:01:36,811
yeah, sure. She has been
for more than a month.

1372
02:01:39,448 --> 02:01:43,350
Brandt, would you like to have dinner
with Francoise and me tonight ?

1373
02:01:43,418 --> 02:01:46,285
Very nice.
We'd be delighted.

1374
02:02:13,215 --> 02:02:15,877
Simone ?
Simone ?

1375
02:02:16,952 --> 02:02:19,716
Simone ! Wha--

1376
02:02:19,788 --> 02:02:22,689
Simone. Darling.

1377
02:02:25,961 --> 02:02:28,088
It's been forever, ja ?

1378
02:02:30,866 --> 02:02:33,733
- Forever, hmm ?
-( Simone Speaking French )

1379
02:03:00,095 --> 02:03:02,029
Hello, Francoise.

1380
02:03:03,832 --> 02:03:05,766
Hello.

1381
02:03:08,003 --> 02:03:09,937
Come in.

1383
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:19,210
oh, my wonderful friends, I want
to thank you for this beautiful night.

1384
02:03:19,281 --> 02:03:21,215
I love you for it.

1385
02:03:21,283 --> 02:03:24,309
And now I'd like to make
a little toast, huh ?

1386
02:03:24,386 --> 02:03:28,823
Farewell, Captain Brandt
of the Army of the Third Reich.

1387
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:30,881
you're drunk, darling.

1388
02:03:30,959 --> 02:03:34,554
- Say good night to everyone.
- No, no, no. Christian understands me.

1389
02:03:34,630 --> 02:03:37,224
Good night, Captain Brandt.

1390
02:03:37,299 --> 02:03:40,268
Tomorrow you'll awaken
to your new life--

1391
02:03:40,335 --> 02:03:43,634
Monsieur Brandt,
citizen of the world.

1392
02:03:43,705 --> 02:03:46,799
Isn't he funny ?
He has such ideas.

1393
02:03:46,875 --> 02:03:50,311
Sit down, Simone.
Sit down for a minute.

1394
02:03:50,379 --> 02:03:53,041
Christian, I-I know
you don't approve,

1395
02:03:53,115 --> 02:03:55,777
but listen to me
for a minute.

1396
02:03:55,851 --> 02:03:58,547
Tell me-- Are we
civilized human beings...

1397
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:01,646
or are we wild beasts ?

1398
02:04:01,723 --> 02:04:04,692
A human being knows
when he has lost...

1399
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:07,490
and he tries
to save himself.

1400
02:04:07,562 --> 02:04:12,625
When you are put into the army,
you are expected to risk your life.

1401
02:04:12,701 --> 02:04:17,468
But you are not expected
to just throw it away.

1402
02:04:17,539 --> 02:04:22,340
After all,
in any war, Christian,

1403
02:04:22,411 --> 02:04:27,906
after all the arms and the legs
have been blown off,

1404
02:04:27,983 --> 02:04:30,474
it doesn't really matter...

1405
02:04:30,552 --> 02:04:33,544
because nothing really changes.

1406
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:42,019
Good night,
my dear friend.

1407
02:04:42,097 --> 02:04:44,031
Francoise,

1408
02:04:47,169 --> 02:04:49,603
be good to him,ja ?

1409
02:04:50,706 --> 02:04:53,470
Because he is the best
of the best.

1410
02:04:53,542 --> 02:04:56,375
- All right, all right.
-Ja.

1411
02:05:05,253 --> 02:05:07,187
Come on.

1412
02:05:18,834 --> 02:05:20,768
Christian.

1413
02:05:25,474 --> 02:05:29,205
you-- you won't report him.

1414
02:05:40,388 --> 02:05:42,322
Thank you.

1415
02:05:47,395 --> 02:05:49,454
you're not the same.

1416
02:05:54,903 --> 02:05:57,064
When you are--

1417
02:05:57,139 --> 02:05:59,232
When you are in a hole...

1418
02:06:01,176 --> 02:06:04,771
filled with your own excrement
for days on end,

1419
02:06:08,049 --> 02:06:12,042
and when you see the faces
and the bodies of the men you've killed,

1420
02:06:13,822 --> 02:06:16,689
you change.

1421
02:06:16,758 --> 02:06:18,953
And when you're
out there like that,

1422
02:06:20,662 --> 02:06:24,530
when you have to live
with death every day...

1423
02:06:24,599 --> 02:06:26,533
for so long,

1424
02:06:28,436 --> 02:06:33,100
you have to keep something
in front of you or you will go insane.

1425
02:06:36,678 --> 02:06:39,306
And there were hours...

1426
02:06:39,381 --> 02:06:45,081
I was always afraid that
I had just invented you.

1427
02:06:45,153 --> 02:06:47,917
But I'm real.

1428
02:06:56,031 --> 02:06:57,965
yeah.

1429
02:06:58,033 --> 02:06:59,967
Christian,

1430
02:07:01,670 --> 02:07:03,604
please stay.

1431
02:07:04,739 --> 02:07:07,936
There isn't anything
for you to fight for.

1432
02:07:08,009 --> 02:07:11,706
There never really was.

1433
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:13,907
Christian,

1434
02:07:13,982 --> 02:07:17,679
you're not the
golden warrior anymore,

1435
02:07:17,752 --> 02:07:19,686
and soon...

1436
02:07:21,089 --> 02:07:24,855
you will be
just another refugee.

1437
02:07:24,926 --> 02:07:27,554
Don't throw this away.

1438
02:07:33,168 --> 02:07:35,102
Please.

1439

Don't throw this away.

1440
02:07:40,141 --> 02:07:42,609

1441
02:07:42,677 --> 02:07:45,077

it's enlisted men with their air

02:33:32,003 --> 02:33:34,597
I'm sorry.

1680
02:33:34,672 --> 02:33:38,039
- Are you hurt ?
- No.

1681
02:33:38,109 --> 02:33:41,078
I can see you had
a bad time.

1682
02:33:41,145 --> 02:33:43,170
Well, so did I.

1683
02:33:43,247 --> 02:33:46,045
I have my wounds, too,
even if you don't see them.

1684
02:33:46,117 --> 02:33:48,950
Running a concentration camp
is not a picnic, believe me,

1685
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:53,514
with all the gas chambers, target
ranges, doctors with their experiments.

1686
02:33:53,591 --> 02:33:56,754
I had an extermination quota
of 1 ,500 people a day--

1687
02:33:56,828 --> 02:34:00,992
Jews, Poles, Russians, French,
political prisoners.

1688
02:34:01,065 --> 02:34:05,399
And I had only 260 men to do it.
Still I managed it.

1689
02:34:05,469 --> 02:34:09,496
Then they sent memorandums from Berlin,
inspectors running, shouting,

1690
02:34:09,574 --> 02:34:11,872
''In Auschwitz they kill
20,000 a day. ''

1691
02:34:11,943 --> 02:34:14,707
( Phone Ringing )

1692
02:34:14,779 --> 02:34:16,838
I know who it is.

1693
02:34:16,914 --> 02:34:19,041
It's Berlin again...

1694
02:34:19,116 --> 02:34:21,550
for the fourth time today.

1695
02:34:24,589 --> 02:34:27,023
yes ?

1696
02:34:27,091 --> 02:34:29,116
yes.

1697
02:34:29,193 --> 02:34:31,627
Very near. A few miles.

1698
02:34:31,696 --> 02:34:34,790
I told you.
All right, I didn't tell you.

1699
02:34:34,866 --> 02:34:37,494
I told whoever
it was that called.

1700
02:34:37,568 --> 02:34:43,029
I have ten men left. How can
I kill everybody in the camp ?

1701
02:34:43,107 --> 02:34:46,406
Don't you understand ?
The equipment is not working.

1702
02:34:46,477 --> 02:34:48,741
Nothing is working.

1703
02:34:48,813 --> 02:34:51,680
I don't care what
they did in Buchenwald.

1704
02:34:51,749 --> 02:34:54,809
I'm here alone, and I have
no personnel left !

1705
02:34:59,523 --> 02:35:02,890
you know what this is,
this phone call ?

1706
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:07,522
They want me to kill every man,
woman and child in the camp
before the Americans get here.

1707
02:35:07,598 --> 02:35:09,532
Six thousand people.

1708
02:35:14,672 --> 02:35:18,608
And the man who asked me
to do this-- this same man--
will walk the streets free.

1709
02:35:18,676 --> 02:35:22,112
And they will come to him,
the Americans, the Russians,

1710
02:35:22,179 --> 02:35:26,445
and he will say, ''I've never
heard of concentration camps. ''

1711
02:35:26,517 --> 02:35:30,954
He will say there never was a national
policy to kill 1 2 million people.

1712
02:35:31,022 --> 02:35:32,956
The S.S. invented it.

1713
02:35:33,024 --> 02:35:37,222
Nobody in the government
ever heard of it.

1714
02:35:37,295 --> 02:35:41,561
And I'll be here trying to
explain to the Americans.

1715
02:35:41,632 --> 02:35:46,865
Do you know, the Americans may not
understand what they see here.

1716
02:35:46,938 --> 02:35:50,066
They may not know that the
German officer-- our kind of officer--

1717
02:35:50,141 --> 02:35:52,837
does what he's ordered to do.

1718
02:35:59,717 --> 02:36:03,084
Well, we at least know...

1719
02:36:03,154 --> 02:36:05,088
what is important--

1720
02:36:05,156 --> 02:36:08,216
the courage to stay
and face the enemy...

1721
02:36:08,292 --> 02:36:12,991
and the honor to be able to say, ''I have
done my duty for the fatherland.''

1722
02:36:22,039 --> 02:36:23,973
What's the matter ?

1723
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:50,174
My God.

1724
02:37:57,315 --> 02:38:01,149
( Man ) Captain, this is
the mayor of the town we just
came through on our way up here.

1725
02:38:01,219 --> 02:38:03,847
He says he can send a gang
of civilians in to help us.

1726
02:38:03,922 --> 02:38:05,856
As I was telling
the sergeant, Captain,

1727
02:38:05,924 --> 02:38:10,884
we have heard some of your most
important generals and newspaper
men are on their way up here.

1728
02:38:10,962 --> 02:38:13,954
I can provide you with a
number of my townspeople...

1729
02:38:14,032 --> 02:38:17,229
- who will help you to
clean up this place--
- yes ?

1730
02:38:17,302 --> 02:38:20,567
Excuse me.

1731
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:24,040
My name is Joseph Silverson.
I am a rabbi.

1732
02:38:24,109 --> 02:38:26,509
yes.

1733
02:38:26,578 --> 02:38:32,107
I do not wish to annoy the officer,
but I have a request to make.

1734
02:38:32,184 --> 02:38:34,118
yes, what is it ?

1735
02:38:35,887 --> 02:38:38,219
Thousands have died here.

1736
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:40,781
More will die tonight, tomorrow.

1737
02:38:42,427 --> 02:38:45,260
Sorry, Rabbi.
We're doing all we can.

1738
02:38:45,330 --> 02:38:49,061
of course. I know that.

1739
02:38:49,134 --> 02:38:51,796
But there's nothing
to be done for them.

1740
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:55,271
Nothing material.
We understand that.

1741
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:57,865
All efforts must be
for the living.

1742
02:38:59,678 --> 02:39:03,774
What I am asking for
is a luxury.

1743
02:39:06,251 --> 02:39:09,186
yes ?

1744
02:39:09,254 --> 02:39:11,950
I ask to be permitted
to collect all of us,

1745
02:39:12,023 --> 02:39:16,221
the living
and those without hope,

1746
02:39:16,294 --> 02:39:18,558
and hold a religious service--

1747
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:22,862
a service for the dead
who have come to their end here.

1748
02:39:26,304 --> 02:39:30,104
There has never been a religious
service for us in this place.

1749
02:39:30,175 --> 02:39:32,700
Permit me, Captain.
I don't like to intrude.

1750
02:39:32,777 --> 02:39:35,473
I understand why the rabbi
has made this request,

1751
02:39:35,547 --> 02:39:37,981
but this is
not the time for it.

1752
02:39:38,049 --> 02:39:42,509
I'm a European. I understand things
perhaps the captain doesn't understand.

1753
02:39:42,587 --> 02:39:47,490
If you allow this gentleman to hold
the services, I'm obliged to warn you.

1754
02:39:47,559 --> 02:39:52,963
There will be riots. The other prisoners
will not stand for it, and...

1755
02:39:53,031 --> 02:39:56,432
the generals who are coming
will not like what they see.

1756
02:40:03,241 --> 02:40:08,304
The, uh, other prisoners
will not stand for it and
the generals will not like it ?

1757
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:10,871
That's a fact.
I guarantee it.

1758
02:40:22,494 --> 02:40:26,590
I'm gonna guarantee
something myself.

1759
02:40:26,665 --> 02:40:30,032
I'm gonna guarantee that you--
you'll hold your services.

1760
02:40:30,101 --> 02:40:33,400
I'm also gonna guarantee that
machine guns will be set up...

1761
02:40:33,471 --> 02:40:35,837
on the roofs of the buildings.

1762
02:40:35,907 --> 02:40:39,741
And further, I will guarantee
that anyone who attempts to
interfere with those services...

1763
02:40:39,811 --> 02:40:41,972
will be fired upon
by those machine guns.

1764
02:40:44,215 --> 02:40:47,981
And further, I guarantee that if you
ever try to come into this place again,

1765
02:40:48,053 --> 02:40:50,214
I will personally break
your neck.

1766
02:40:50,288 --> 02:40:52,222
That is all.

1767
02:41:00,765 --> 02:41:03,029
Thank you very much, sir.

1768
02:41:21,519 --> 02:41:25,421
Ackerman, you're not needed around here.
Go take a walk outside the camp.

1769
02:41:28,360 --> 02:41:30,294
Thank you, sir.

1770
02:41:32,197 --> 02:41:34,131
Whiteacre.

1771
02:41:57,589 --> 02:41:59,921
How do you feel ?

1772
02:41:59,991 --> 02:42:01,925
Fine, fine.

1773
02:42:03,762 --> 02:42:07,163
I never-- Did you ever imagine
it could be like that ?

1774
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:09,166
Nope.

1775
02:42:10,568 --> 02:42:13,162
My father's brother
died in one of those.

1776
02:42:14,773 --> 02:42:17,401
- Did you see them ?
- The ovens ?

1777
02:42:17,475 --> 02:42:19,409
yeah, yeah.

1778
02:42:21,546 --> 02:42:24,879
- Did I ever tell you about my father ?
- No.

1779
02:42:29,654 --> 02:42:33,181
When that guy started
to talk to Green...

1780
02:42:33,258 --> 02:42:36,227
- I could've gone outside
and blown my brains out.
- I felt the same way.

1781
02:42:36,294 --> 02:42:41,254
And then Green said,
''I guarantee. I guarantee.''

1782
02:42:41,332 --> 02:42:44,062
I don't know. I got a lot
of hope for Captain Green.

1783
02:42:45,370 --> 02:42:48,635
you know what ?
When this war's over,

1784
02:42:48,706 --> 02:42:51,539
Green is gonna be
running the world.

1785
02:42:51,609 --> 02:42:56,444
There are millions of him.
Millions ! They're human beings.

1786
02:42:56,514 --> 02:42:59,745
There are millions, millions of them !
They're gonna run the world !

1787
02:43:06,791 --> 02:43:09,385
( Vehicle Approaching )

1788
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:43,985
( Grunts )

1789
02:43:44,062 --> 02:43:45,996
( Banging Continues )

1790
02:43:50,301 --> 02:43:52,235
( Screams )

1791
02:44:48,793 --> 02:44:51,387
Kraut !

1792
02:46:31,863 --> 02:46:34,127
- ( Horn Honks )
- Hey !

1793
02:46:34,198 --> 02:46:36,291
( Horn Honks )
