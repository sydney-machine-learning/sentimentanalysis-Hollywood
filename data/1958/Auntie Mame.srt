1
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,209
'I, Edwin Dennis,
being of sound mind and body...

2
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,372
...do hereby bequeath to my only son,
Patrick, all my worldly possessions.

3
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:28,477
In the event of my demise, I direct
Norah Muldoon to deliver Patrick...

4
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:33,348
...to my sister, Mame Dennis,
at 3 Beekman Place, New York city.

5
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:37,352
His expenses shall be supervised
by Mr. Dwight Babcock...

6
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,088
...acting for the Knickerbocker Bank...

7
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:43,024
...with the power to keep my crazy sister...

8
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:48,130
...from doing anything too eccentric
and bringing him up to be like her.

9
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,368
Since I am in splendid condition
through workouts at the Brokers club...

10
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:58,673
...I am confident that these provisions
won't go into effect for years.

11
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:05,063
I hereby affix my hand this fourteenth
day of September, in the year 1928.'

12
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:20,095
You've been reading it for a week.
Why bring it to New York?

13
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,597
It's the only way I can believe it.

14
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:28,136
Besides, your Aunt Mame may like it as
a remembrance of your sainted father.

15
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:33,833
Don't you be going by way of
the North Pole. We're not greenhorns.

16
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:54,388
That's 95 cents.
- Here's a dollar. Keep the change.

17
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:19,573
It's like the ladies' restroom
in the oriental Theater.

18
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,792
You're not scared, are you, Norah?

19
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:33,913
Of course not. And don't you be, child.
Norah's here to look after you.

20
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:41,603
Saints alive.

21
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:46,906
You want?
- Is this the residence of Mame Dennis?

22
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,277
Mame Dennis. Oh, yes.

23
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,854
I'm Norah Muldoon.
I'm bringing Dennis to his aunt.

24
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:56,219
Oh, you come in. You wait. I fetch.

25
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:59,918
Madam having affair now.

26
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,007
Isn't he wonderful?

27
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:39,161
Help is on the way, darlings.

28
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,341
That adorable bootlegger is
on his way with a gallon of gin.

29
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:50,378
Oh, Allen, darling.
Edna, I called you yesterday.

30
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,515
Hello, Mame.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

31
00:05:53,615 --> 00:06:00,043
Vladimir, what are you doing here?
- Drinking myself to death, of course.

32
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:02,757
Besides, I'm your guest of honor.

33
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:07,462
Of course. You must hear
his new symphony, the pastoral.

34
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:11,633
It has real airplane motors
and live sheep. It's devastating.

35
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:15,070
You've met our guest of honor,
Vladimir Klinkoff? Miss...

36
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,968
Mrs. Klinkoff.

37
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,343
Yes, of course. Then you've met.
Oh, Perry.

38
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:24,163
Doris, now where are you off to?

39
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:27,515
Everyone's going to Clifton's.
It's nearly 7.

40
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:30,385
Give Clifton my love.
I'll be right over...

41
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:35,490
...Oh, dear. The Employment  Bureau didn't
tell me you were bringing a child.

42
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,828
He looks nice. If he misbehaves,
we can toss him in the river.

43
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:43,198
Please let us escape
from this den of criminals.

44
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:47,035
Doctor, get this woman
on your couch in a hurry.

45
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:52,073
I'm not that kind of a woman.
I'm looking for a Miss Mame Dennis.

46
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,975
Ito. Ito.
- Yes, missy.

47
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:57,879
Show this woman to the kitchen,
start her on glasses.

48
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,817
This not dishwashing lady.
- Then I must have invited you. A drink?

49
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:08,356
I'm Norah Muldoon. Didn't you get
my telegram saying we'd arrive at 6:00?

50
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:14,029
No, your telegram said October 1.
That's tomorrow. This is September 31.

51
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,032
No, 'tis the first,
curse the evil day.

52
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:21,736
Everybody knows 3o days has
September, April, June and...

53
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:27,297
But, darling, I'm your Auntie Mame.

54
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:32,939
Quiet, everybody. I have an
important announcement to make.

55
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:39,053
This is my little  boy.

56
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,058
He's not really my little  boy.
He's my late brother's son.

57
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:48,563
My only living  relative. That's all we
have, just each other, my little  love.

58
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:51,633
Well, what am I going to call you, dear?

59
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,070
Pat. Patrick Dennis.
- I know the Dennis part.

60
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,950
And from now on, you must call me
Auntie Mame. Well, well, well, now.

61
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,044
Would you like a mar...? No.

62
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:06,848
Is it your bedtime? No, it can't be.
The powder room?

63
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:12,813
Food, food. That's it. You must be
famished. Come right along with me.

64
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:21,403
Take your shoes off, darling.
It's like removing your hat in America.

65
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:31,005
Before sukiyaki,
a little  hors d'oeuvre.

66
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,475
Could  I try some of that jam?
- Jam?

67
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:36,144
That blackberry jam?
- Of course.

68
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:41,174
Actually, it's sort of a fishberry jam.
It's called caviar.

69
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:45,618
Now, some pickled octopus,
raw fish tails...

70
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:51,057
...it's salty, but I like it.
- Good. You have wonderful taste.

71
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,826
Vera.

72
00:08:55,663 --> 00:09:02,227
Vera, this is my little  boy.
Patrick, I want you to meet a star.

73
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:06,975
A great lady of the theater
and my dearest friend, Vera Charles.

74
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:09,100
Hello.
- How do you do?

75
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:12,940
She just loves little  boys.

76
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,254
Who's he?
- That's a Lithuanian bishop.

77
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:24,526
Doesn't speak a word of English.
Stimulating man. Oh, Your Grace.

78
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:27,896
He's a darling and so worldly
for a man of God.

79
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:32,433
Everything in the universe is composed
of the elements of Aristotle.

80
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:37,300
Thus man is fire, dust and air
mingled with water.

81
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:40,875
Acacius, darling,
this is my nephew Patrick.

82
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:44,342
This is Mr. Page, dear.

83
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:48,249
That means 'Know thyself.'
Mr. Page is an educator.

84
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:51,953
He runs a school where
they do advanced things.

85
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,923
You think you might find room for Patrick?

86
00:09:55,023 --> 00:10:00,620
For him, yes. In this boy,
I see already the fire, dust and air.

87
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:03,965
Add water and stir.
Would you want to go there?

88
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:08,069
Do they wear uniforms?
- At my school, we wear nothing.

89
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:12,540
It's heaven. It'll stimulate
his psyche and stir up his libido.

90
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,910
What's libido?
- It's perfectly simple. It...

91
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,645
...I'll tell you what we'll do.

92
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,952
Every time you hear a word you don't
understand, dear, write it down.

93
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,020
Later, I will explain it.

94
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,819
I'm off, Mame.
- Lindsay. Lindsay, this is Patrick.

95
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:34,996
Patrick, I want you to meet
Lindsay Woolsey, the publisher.

96
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:39,500
Circulate, darling. Circulate.
- New man in your life?

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,637
Little Patrick.
Guess I won't see much of you.

98
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:46,207
We'll go to the zoo,
the aquarium, the Philharmonic.

99
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:49,277
We'll be together constantly,
the three of us.

100
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:52,267
That's exactly what I had in mind.

101
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,383
Good night, Mame. Thanks.
- Watch it, Phyllis.

102
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:57,952
Some party.
- So good of you to come.

103
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:02,132
You played beautifully.
I can't thank you enough.

104
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:04,953
Goodbye, Mrs...

105
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:10,999
... of course.
There you are, my little love.

106
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:14,802
Come here with your Auntie Mame
and sit down a minute.

107
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:18,338
We'll really get to know each other.

108
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:24,679
Well, now, read me all the words
you don't understand.

109
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,876
'Libido, inferiority complex,
stinko, blotto...

110
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,679
...free love, bathtub gin...

111
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:37,954
...monkey glands, Kari Marx.'
Is he one of the Marx Brothers?

112
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,360
No, dear.

113
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,464
She last pretty good tonight.
Marie Antoinette room again?

114
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:46,467
Yes. Perhaps she'll wake up
without a head.

115
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:51,231
Get that dog of a dress off her.
- Me tuck her in.

116
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,166
Is the English lady sick?

117
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,712
She's not English.
She's from Pittsburgh.

118
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:01,149
She sounded English.
- She has to do something.

119
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,717
Now, where were we?

120
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:06,947
'Narcississistic, Lysissistrata...

121
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:11,649
...cubism, squiffed,
neurotic, heterosexual.'

122
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:15,997
My, what an eager mind.
You won't need these words for months.

123
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:20,101
Your vocabulary needs work.
Didn't your father talk to you?

124
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:23,972
I only saw him at breakfast.
- What did he say then?

125
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:28,476
He usually said, 'Pipe down, kid.
The ode man's hung.'

126
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:32,513
That's succinct.
What did you do in Chicago for fun?

127
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:36,551
Norah took me to the movies
every Saturday afternoon.

128
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:40,355
I played Parcheesi with the doorman,
until he got fired.

129
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:44,492
Didn't they do anything cultural
for you? Well, never mind.

130
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:47,929
Your Auntie Mame will open doors for you.

131
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:53,092
Doors you never even dreamed existed.
What times we'll have.

132
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,671
Now, what on earth did I do with that will?

133
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:01,868
Now, it's here someplace.
Here we are.

134
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:07,382
Now, 'Get Mahjong lesson, hair done.'
That can't be it. Yes, it is it.

135
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:10,151
Oh, dear. This is a legal document.

136
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:13,588
A lot of folderol about
the Knickerbocker Bank...

137
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:16,691
...and some Mr. Babcock,
your trustee...

138
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:22,296
...oh, I see. I have the responsibility
and your trustee has the authority.

139
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:25,533
Norah took me to a movie once
about a trustee.

140
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:29,904
There was a prison break.
A trustee saved the warden's daughter.

141
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:34,542
This isn't the kind of trustee
that lives in a prison. As a rule.

142
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:37,145
We'll tackle him in our own good time.

143
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:41,449
Now, Patrick, is your Auntie Mame
anything like you expected?

144
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:46,788
No. The only picture I saw of you was
with a shawl and a rose in your teeth.

145
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,924
Like a Spanish lady.
It's in my suitcase.

146
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:54,095
Didn't your father tell you
anything about me before he died?

147
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:57,824
Yes, ma'am.
- Well, what was it?

148
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,799
Come now, my little  love.

149
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,880
You must airways be frank
with your Auntie Mame.

150
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:11,712
Well, my father said, since you're
my only living  relative...

151
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:16,010
...I might be living  with you someday, and...

152
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:18,784
...well?

153
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:24,903
But that to be left in your hands was
a fate he wouldn't wish on a dog.

154
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,259
That...

155
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:30,331
...what's that?

156
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:35,503
That is a B. The first letter of a
7-letter word that means your father.

157
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:38,806
Come, child,
I'll show you to your room.

158
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:43,311
It's a cozy little nook. My loom is
by the window. Do you weave?

159
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:48,149
You can sit at it. I have instructions
from a descendant of Pocahontas.

160
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:52,820
I began with an enormous rug.
It's that bell pull by the fireplace.

161
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Your own little den.

162
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,186
How stupid of me.
I gave up weaving for sculpture.

163
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:04,365
That is, a sculptor friend
used this room for six months.

164
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:08,703
A divine man. Such talented fingers,
but what he did to my bust.

165
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:11,169
That's the head, you know.

166
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:15,039
I guess it's not quite ready yet.

167
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:21,015
The Marie Antoinette room. No, Veras
there. You better camp out with me.

168
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:25,017
Shall we try this out for size?

169
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:31,857
Perfect. Shall we...?
- I'll do it.

170
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:37,064
Sheets. Where were the sheets...?
- When will you be home from the party?

171
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:40,819
What makes you think
I'm going to any party?

172
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:51,839
Just as I was getting used to
all them dragons. What is it?

173
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:55,610
Don't ask me. I didn't paint it.
Can I get in her room?

174
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,880
At 2: oo? You'll be lucky
to get in by 5. She's sleeping.

175
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,717
I'll start in the other room.
- Can't.

176
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,086
She's sleeping in two bedrooms?

177
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:10,391
No. It's the first lady of American
theater out cold in the guest room.

178
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,860
Again? What does she do, live here?

179
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,064
She don't live here. She drinks
and does her passing out here.

180
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,201
It's a wonder their blood
hasn't turned to vinegar.

181
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:23,471
In two weeks,
they've had 13 cocktail parties.

182
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,373
Only 13 in two weeks?

183
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:30,828
They had to call one off.
The bootlegger couldn't come that day.

184
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:38,078
Auntie Mame. Auntie Mame.

185
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:43,313
What is it? What happened?

186
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:47,587
I've got something to show you.
Look.

187
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:50,329
Bats.

188
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:55,269
I built it. It has a rubber-band motor.
I built the body out of wood.

189
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:59,237
Please, darling,
your Auntie Mame is hung.

190
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,040
Sure, Auntie Mame.

191
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:10,044
Sure.
- Patrick, Patrick, come back.

192
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:13,788
You know, I really am
interested in all your projects.

193
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:17,551
Child, how can you see with all that light?

194
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:24,565
That's better. Be an angel
and tell Ito to bring me breakfast.

195
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:29,203
Black coffee and a sidecar.
And a cold towie for Auntie Vera.

196
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:34,275
Is she in the guest room again?
- Since Sunday. Run along, darling.

197
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:38,646
First, come and give your Auntie Mame
a good morning kiss.

198
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,544
Gently, darling, gently.

199
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:46,709
That was lovely.
I really am fascinated by aviation.

200
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:51,392
I never knew before
they did it all with rubber bands.

201
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,700
Miss Dennis? Yes, she's here.
Who's calling, please?

202
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,180
Mr. Babcock.
- Hold the wire.

203
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:06,474
It's Mr. Babcock, from the bank.
- I've been dodging him for days.

204
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:12,672
Well, hello, Mr. Babcock. How nice
to hear your voice at long last.

205
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:16,884
I too am looking forward
with anticipation to meeting you.

206
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:20,287
The little  lad is fine.
He can't wait to meet you.

207
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:23,524
Hurry, my tray, darling.
Auntie needs fuel.

208
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:27,219
Do drop over anytime, Mr. Babcock.

209
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:29,994
In how many minutes?

210
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:37,034
Yes, 57th Street is right
in my neck of the woods.

211
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:40,262
Spitting distance?

212
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:45,179
How vivid. Come right along, then.
You can join me for tea.

213
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,684
That's right, number 3 Beekman Place.
Right away. Vera. Vera.

214
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,359
Vera. Vera. I am about to be attacked
by the Knickerbocker Bank.

215
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:01,758
That's lovely.
- Vera.

216
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:06,634
Why'd that oriental sandman
let me sleep in my best Chanel?

217
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,736
He tried but you bit him.

218
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:11,705
Patrick's trustee,
some hideous man...

219
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:16,844
...is about to descend upon me
like a vulture and rob me of my child.

220
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:20,314
He's coming here?
In the middle of the night?

221
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:23,577
That moon's bright.

222
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:27,855
Stop being silly. I have got
to make the right impression.

223
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:33,093
The Knickerbocker Bank is so
conservative, they don't pay interest.

224
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:38,995
All right. Let's get organized.
What time is it, and what day is it?

225
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,801
I was due at the Theater Guild.

226
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:45,573
You can't desert me in my predicament.
What will I wear?

227
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:49,777
How can I face the ?
- Will this make me look Scarsdale?

228
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:54,648
Have you ever been to Scarsdale?
- Good afternoon, Aunt Vera.

229
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:58,152
Do Lillian Gish.
Simple dress, Madonna-like hairdo.

230
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:02,916
Madonna-like hairdo. That's it.
A switch. A switch.

231
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,285
You got one?
- Dozens.

232
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:09,830
Do you throw anything away?
- I may go back to one of these colours.

233
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:15,769
If you kept your hair natural as I...
- I'd be bald. Pick one close to mine.

234
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,899
Try this. You need a dress like I wore
as Lady... That's stunning.

235
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:24,979
It's my new dress.
I haven't had it on yet.

236
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,283
I won't put $500 on my back
for that awful man. A suit will do.

237
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:32,953
Hold it so I can braid it like a halo.
- I've got to go.

238
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:37,558
I can't let him see you. He'll think
I run a house for wanton women.

239
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:41,058
I'll wear your mink.
- Over my dead body.

240
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,256
This dress is heaven.

241
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,424
You know, green suits me.
I think I'll phone up Maggie.

242
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:52,006
Put this on my head. Hurry.
No matter how it looks.

243
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:54,842
I've got to go.
- Don't you dare leave me.

244
00:21:54,942 --> 00:22:00,414
You could  care less about my career...
- Not already. Norah, Ito, the door.

245
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:03,659
I've gotta get out before he gets in.

246
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:06,487
I can't leave him down in the foyer.

247
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:08,355
That's the third time.

248
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:12,593
Be my friend for five minutes.
- I've been a friend.

249
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:15,696
Go down and make
Mr. Babcock feel at home.

250
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:17,796
But the theater guild.

251
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:23,408
Get out of my way. What am I gonna
do with this damn stinking halo?

252
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:34,682
You want?

253
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:38,522
I'm Mr. Babcock.
Miss Dennis is expecting me.

254
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:42,083
You come in.
- Thank you.

255
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:45,656
I take coat?
- Thank you. Thank you.

256
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:55,191
You sit.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:56,103 --> 00:23:01,973
Mr. Babcock? We've been expecting you.
My name is Patrick Dennis.

258
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:05,578
Please sit down.
- Fine. Fine.

259
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:18,487
Auntie Mame will be right down.

260
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,399
She's having a little trouble with her halo.

261
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:25,258
She'll be right down.

262
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:35,435
You look like a bully little chap.

263
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,271
Yes, sir, a bully little chap.

264
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:42,745
You look very bully too.
- Yes.

265
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:49,152
Would you care for a martini, Mr. Babcock?

266
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,652
Dry or extra dry?

267
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:58,926
Sit down, please. I'll make them
like I do for Mr. Wolcott.

268
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:21,949
Stir, never shake. Bruises the gin.

269
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:48,682
Would you care for an olive?

270
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:54,562
Auntie Mame says olives take up
too much room in such a little  glass.

271
00:24:57,524 --> 00:24:59,583
Why, Mr. Babcock.

272
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:04,732
What an honor it is
to have you in our little  home.

273
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:09,903
I wonder if it makes the best first
impression on a sensitive young mind...

274
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:13,140
...to see you drinking
during business hours.

275
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,910
But he...
- I won't breathe a word to the bank.

276
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,047
Just one minute.
Where did he learn to mix...?

277
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:23,446
Mr. Babcock, knowledge is power.

278
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:29,523
That is exactly what I'm here for.
To discuss this boy's proper education.

279
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:31,623
Nuts?

280
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:35,329
No, thank you.
- Won't you sit down?

281
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:40,367
He won't have to worry about his
future. His money is in steady bonds.

282
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:46,006
You'll agree that it's time he be
enrolled in an institution of learning.

283
00:25:46,106 --> 00:25:49,777
I'm already enrolled in...
- Let Mr. Babcock talk.

284
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:55,616
I've gone to pains to gather information
on some better boys' schools in town.

285
00:25:55,716 --> 00:25:59,186
I prefer coeducational schools.
- What do you mean?

286
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:04,485
Coeducational means when boys
and girls go to school together.

287
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:08,529
First, the Bixby School
which is known to be splendid.

288
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:12,032
Have you considered a school
run by Acacius Page?

289
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:14,868
It follows ancient Greek principles...

290
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:20,007
Your brother's will was most specific.
Conservative schooling, he said.

291
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:23,343
There's my alma mater,
St. Boniface in Massachusetts.

292
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,845
It's too far.

293
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:28,015
You'd better settle on the Browning School.

294
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:33,951
It is known to be conservative
and this gives the boys basic...

295
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:42,428
That's enough candy, dear.
- Sorry.

296
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:46,965
Not you, Mr. Babcock.
You can have all you want.

297
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,771
Have you thought of
the Dillman School? It's here...

298
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:55,676
Too experimental. You wanna keep
the riffraff out of the boy's life.

299
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:59,431
The school must be exclusive
and restricted.

300
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:03,412
Exclusively what and restricted to whom?

301
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:07,154
We must spare the boy certain influences...

302
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:11,504
...from the wrong side of the tracks,
shall we say?

303
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:15,022
Mr. Babbitt...
- Babcock.

304
00:27:15,195 --> 00:27:19,967
Yes. It was very good of you to come.
- What school will it be?

305
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:23,837
Name the school, and Patrick
and I will know what to do.

306
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:27,498
I'd say Bixby.
- Then bully for Bixby.

307
00:27:27,674 --> 00:27:31,478
I'll make out a check to Bixby School.
You register him.

308
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:34,103
Whatever you say.

309
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:37,317
I say I'm very happy to have met you.

310
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:42,089
After the reports I'd heard,
I was prejudiced, and not in your favor.

311
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:47,286
But I find you a woman
with a very powerful charm.

312
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:51,830
And you're a man
with a very powerful bank.

313
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,770
Floor all scrubbed.
Clean just like ode country.

314
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,474
I go now. Get iamb chops,
bottle of milk for boy.

315
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,910
Pick up my coat.
- Bye, Aunt Vera.

316
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,035
Bye, kid.

317
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:56,396
Don't drop anything. What a marvellous
day. October's bright, blue weather.

318
00:28:56,496 --> 00:29:00,701
All we've seen was the store.
Haven't even called my office.

319
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:03,895
Oh, stop complaining, Lindsay.

320
00:29:04,304 --> 00:29:07,240
When are we going
to have time to ourselves?

321
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:13,301
I've had to make up Patrick's 1o
neglected years in a matter of months.

322
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,716
Dr. Spock says it's impossible.

323
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:19,353
Does Dr. Spock mention
that a child needs a father?

324
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,756
There are a lot of women
who think I'm attractive.

325
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:28,466
Don't start that. How can I be a wife?
I'm too busy being a mother.

326
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:33,522
Oh, I forgot. One moment.
Thank you.

327
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,999
My hat. Thank you.

328
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,909
I hope Patrick likes the chemistry set,
the books, the atlas, the Kipling.

329
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:46,279
I don't like your latest fad.
- Fad? Patrick?

330
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:50,217
I've seen you through yogi,
sculpture, dance and foods.

331
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:54,388
You take each as if nothing else
existed. Then you drop them.

332
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:57,324
You think he's a temporary enthusiasm?

333
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:02,062
It's called 'moulding a new life.'
- You've been in some mood.

334
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:07,167
You deceitful, irresponsible bohemian.
- Whatever do you mean?

335
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,971
You're not fit to raise a child.
- Something's happened?

336
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,672
Come here, you heathen.

337
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:15,342
What's wrong?
- He came to my school...

338
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:19,646
...I dropped by the Bixby School
and what did I find?

339
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:22,282
I find he isn't even registered.

340
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:25,419
I hunted through
every low, crackpot school.

341
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,589
I found him in the lowest of them.
- Mr. Page is progressive.

342
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,225
There they were.
A room full of them.

343
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:38,198
Boys, girls, teachers, romping around
naked, bare as the day they were born.

344
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:43,236
The children were engaged in
normal, healthful, broadening pursuits.

345
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:47,407
Broadening? Show them what
you were doing when I broke in.

346
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:51,711
We were playing fish families.
It's part of constructive play.

347
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:53,713
Listen to this.
- Show me.

348
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:56,216
We do it right after yogurt time.

349
00:30:56,316 --> 00:31:00,687
Mrs. Page and all the girls
crouch down under the sun lamps...

350
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:05,192
...pretending to be lady fishes
depositing their eggs in the sand.

351
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:10,052
Then Mr. Page and all the boys
do what gentlemen fish do.

352
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:13,100
What could  be more wholesome or natural?

353
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,280
Natural? Well, it might
be natural for a sardine.

354
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:21,341
Mr. Babcock, I consider
your behaviour most undignified.

355
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:24,177
Undignified? At least I wear a vest.

356
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:29,349
Making a scene. Causing
a traumatic experience for this child.

357
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:34,121
I know how you twist things around.
I'm getting out of this nudist camp...

358
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:38,058
...before you make me look
like the president of free love.

359
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:42,891
Mr. Babcock,
not in front of the B-o-Y.

360
00:31:44,397 --> 00:31:48,935
Tomorrow morning I'm taking
this kid off to boarding school.

361
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:52,038
I am placing him in St. Boniface Academy.

362
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:55,342
You'll only get him Christmas and summer.

363
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:59,079
I wish I could  stop you from that.
- Do I have to?

364
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:03,950
Please, I'll do whatever you say.
- Not on your life. He goes tomorrow.

365
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,288
Let's be reasonable.
- I'll make him a decent Christian...

366
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,590
...if I have to break his bones.

367
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,425
Give me another chance.

368
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:16,863
I wouldn't give you the time
after the double-cross you pulled.

369
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,227
But he's all that I have.

370
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:25,977
Have him ready at 8:00 sharp tomorrow.
Kid, you'd better be wearing knickers.

371
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:35,608
I want to stay with you, Auntie Mame.
I don't want go to St. Bony-face.

372
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:38,149
Now, hush.

373
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:41,115
Hush, my little  love.

374
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:48,721
I'm sure St. Boniface is really very nice.

375
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:54,926
You go upstairs now, dear...

376
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,982
...and get ready for dinner.

377
00:32:58,004 --> 00:33:00,802
We'll talk about it later.

378
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:23,027
Lindsay.

379
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,424
Lindsay, what am I going to do?

380
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:30,329
Mame, I'm sorry.

381
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,503
Well, I...

382
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:38,502
...I just don't think I can bear it.

383
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:41,844
I just don't.

384
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:46,484
Mame.

385
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,656
I've never seen you cry before.

386
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,756
Mame.

387
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:56,196
Mame, are you home?
- Is that you, Vera?

388
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,696
What on earth does she want?

389
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:03,069
Have you talked to your stockbroker?
Yes, I can see you have.

390
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:08,141
What about her stockbroker?
- He's trying to locate both of you.

391
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,281
What happened?
- Nothing.

392
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:14,176
Except nothing's worth anything anymore.

393
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:18,685
Hello.
- Now, don't you worry.

394
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:23,657
It can't affect us. We own solid stuff
like Bank of the United States.

395
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:29,877
Missy Dennis, stockbroker want to say
hello before he jump out of window.

396
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:36,919
How bad is it, Arthur?
Not Bank of the United States.

397
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:40,135
Atwater Kent too?

398
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:46,435
Mame, I'm afraid you're wiped out.
We all are.

399
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:50,417
Everyone said I was a fool
spending all my money at Tiffany's.

400
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:53,520
Who cares about money?
I've lost my child.

401
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,890
What?
- Patrick's trustee is sending him away.

402
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,720
Oh, Mame, darling.

403
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:03,327
I know how you must feel.

404
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:07,896
Do you?
- Well, of course I do.

405
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:11,971
I never had a child,
but I'm an actress. I can imagine.

406
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:14,507
There must be something I can do.

407
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:20,347
I've got it. The perfect solution.
It'll skive everything. You'll work.

408
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,916
Work?
- You'll return to the stage...

409
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:26,986
...in my play, Midsummer Madness.
There are dozens of parts.

410
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:30,490
We open Thanksgiving in New Haven.
I'll call Max.

411
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,494
Do you think I could ?
- Of course you could . Couldn't she?

412
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:37,097
You'll have to work at something.

413
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:41,067
The only chance to get Patrick back
is to show Babcock...

414
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:44,571
...that you've settled down
into something steady.

415
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:48,641
Or to earn money to fight him with.
You're so right.

416
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:52,912
About $500 a week to start.
- It'll be a bit in the last act.

417
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:55,987
Then there'll be a raise. I accept.

418
00:35:56,015 --> 00:36:01,030
Your heart is from Tiffany's too.
It'll be like ode times...

419
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:05,558
...when we were trooping together
in Chu Chin Girl. I can't wait.

420
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:07,922
This is a serious drama.

421
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:10,663
I was in front. Vera was behind me.

422
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:13,533
If I'd been behind you,
I'd have kicked...

423
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:17,288
...I know exactly what I did.
It used to go:

424
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,839
That's it.

425
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:22,335
An appalling situation.
- Frightful, my dear.

426
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:24,304
Where's Miss Dennis?

427
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:28,067
Keep your shirt on.
She's still making up.

428
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:32,479
She has a lousy two-line bit.
She's had two acts to make up.

429
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,583
Make sure she knows her entrance
is from the other side.

430
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:41,054
But in all fairness to him,
I believe she's been leading him on.

431
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:45,318
After all, she is a princess.
He, a commoner.

432
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:49,762
Everybody into the solarium.
I think I hear them coming now.

433
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:52,831
But, Reginald, to do such a thing.

434
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:56,772
To dash away together like this
would be mad.

435
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:01,033
Quite devastatingly mad.

436
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:06,035
Quite devastatingly mad.

437
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,785
Lord Dudley, your flattery would turn
a young girls head.

438
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:17,815
Come now. Hurry to the ball.
If we tarry, we shall be late.

439
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,733
No, it would be madness.

440
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:28,458
I belong to one world, you to another.
It's better we part now.

441
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:32,832
Now, while we cherish
this ecstasy we've known.

442
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,875
What have you got back there,
reindeer?

443
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:40,810
This is goodbye, Reginald.
I hear the others coming.

444
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:50,156
Lord Dudley, no more champagne
or I shall forget myself altogether.

445
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:54,427
I have... I have...
- I must say, you're the funniest man.

446
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,992
I have something to tell you.

447
00:38:56,996 --> 00:39:00,488
I have been unexpectedly
called back home.

448
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,501
Prince Alex needs me
and my place is by his side.

449
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:09,105
It has been so lovely this whole summer.

450
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:15,408
But after all, it has only been
midsummer madness.

451
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:21,109
Lady iris, would you be good enough
to ring for my wrap?

452
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,255
Certainly, princess.

453
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:30,325
And get rid of those damn cowbells.

454
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:37,299
May I help you, princess?
- Thank you, Lady iris.

455
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:45,178
Goodbye, goodbye.

456
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:50,409
I shall airways feel
a strong attachment to you all.

457
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,963
Let go.
- I can't. I'm stuck.

458
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:55,078
Let go.

459
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:01,825
It's my bracelet. It's caught on you.
- Bring down the curtain.

460
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:07,533
I was only...

461
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:12,223
Ruining my beautiful play
with your lousy bell ringing.

462
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,440
These are the only bracelets
I have in the world.

463
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:22,748
Enough. That's enough.

464
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,591
Okay, strike the set.
- Why?

465
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:48,841
I thought I'd give her character.
- You scene-stealing, society biddy.

466
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:52,445
You destroyed me.
There were critics out there.

467
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,013
We're all ruined.

468
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:59,881
Don't let me catch the sight of
your evil face again, you assassin.

469
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,953
But, Vera... You see...

470
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:06,459
...I felt if I should make something out of...

471
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,874
There weren't many lines, and I felt...

472
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,726
Ms. Charles asked...

473
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:05,284
...I thought you were very good,
Auntie Mame. Everybody noticed you.

474
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:09,844
My little  love.
How did you get up to New Haven?

475
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,115
Ito brought me up.

476
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:15,094
How could  Ito drive you up?
I sold the car.

477
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:18,391
He didn't drive. We hitchhiked.

478
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:21,167
Mr. Babcock thinks you're in school.

479
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:26,170
It's all right.
It's Thanksgiving vacation.

480
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,830
Is it?

481
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:36,772
Can I be your escort?
Can I take you back to your hotel?

482
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:44,553
You can take me all the way
back to New York.

483
00:42:46,726 --> 00:42:48,726
Patrick.

484
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:52,053
Oh, Patrick.

485
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:56,092
Are you ashamed of your Auntie Mame?

486
00:42:56,769 --> 00:42:58,828
I'm proud of you.

487
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:03,883
Nobody liked the stinky ode play
at all until you came in.

488
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:20,290
Lady iris?

489
00:43:26,098 --> 00:43:28,293
Charmed...

490
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:31,633
...Lord Dudley.

491
00:44:06,472 --> 00:44:09,141
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.

492
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:13,212
You want to talk to Mr. Gutterman?
I'll connect you.

493
00:44:13,312 --> 00:44:16,883
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.

494
00:44:16,983 --> 00:44:23,273
Yes, Mr. Bibberman. You'd like to talk
to Mr. Applewhite. I'll connect you.

495
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:29,379
Yes, long distance, how are you?

496
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:34,118
Mr. Widdicombe, I have
your San Francisco call for you.

497
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,430
Yes, Mr. Bibberman?

498
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:42,842
Did I connect you with Mr. Gutterman
instead of Mr. Applewhite? I'm sorry.

499
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:46,879
What are you doing in that hole
with Mr. Gutterman?

500
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,614
Yes, Mr. Widdicombe?

501
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:52,118
I'll try to reconnect you again
with San Francisco.

502
00:44:52,218 --> 00:44:56,589
Let me see, Mr. Bibberman is in there.
Where is Mr. Applewhite?

503
00:44:56,689 --> 00:45:02,028
There you are, Mr. Applewhite.
There's no such place as San Francisco.

504
00:45:02,128 --> 00:45:04,153
Please.

505
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:39,899
Roller-skate lady.
Where is the roller-skate lady?

506
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,969
That stupid clerk sent me two left skates.

507
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:46,439
Does Macy think my son has two left feet?

508
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:51,979
If you'll just be patient, madam.
Where is the roller-skate lady?

509
00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:56,482
I don't know how I got in Tinkertoys.
- I want a pair of skates.

510
00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:59,346
One moment. Oh, Mr. Loomis.

511
00:45:59,552 --> 00:46:02,612
Will you help me with my sales slip?

512
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:05,781
Why don't you let me send these coD?

513
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:09,295
Then you wouldn't have to pay.
- I would eventually.

514
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:13,388
Of course, but why worry about it now?

515
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:17,770
Now, here's your slip.
It's so simple.

516
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:23,905
No big, bulky bundies to carry or lose
en route, as it were. I love coD.

517
00:46:24,043 --> 00:46:29,913
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.
- Just one moment, please. Yes?

518
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,312
Yes?

519
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:36,722
Can you assist me in ordering
24 pair of those roller skates?

520
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:41,987
Twenty-four pair.
My, what a proud father you must be.

521
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:43,963
I'm a single gentleman.

522
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:47,233
But there are tykes
at Oglethorpe Orphanage...

523
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,136
...that will be happy to see that package.

524
00:46:50,236 --> 00:46:53,239
That's a nice thing to do.
It's the true...

525
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:56,208
How much does that come to,
little  lady?

526
00:46:56,308 --> 00:46:58,936
You want to pay? Cash?

527
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:01,914
Just Oglethorpe orphanage,
Georgia.

528
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:05,184
Wouldn't you prefer if I sent them coD?

529
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:09,255
The nippers wouldn't think
much of their Santa Claus...

530
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:15,220
...if he filled their stockings
with bills for collection on delivery.

531
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:18,356
I haven't worked here long.

532
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:22,568
The only kind of sales slip
I know how to make out is coD.

533
00:47:22,668 --> 00:47:25,218
I might be of assistance here.

534
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:30,209
We'd get in a lot of trouble.
- I'm familiar with financial matters.

535
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:34,547
First, get your duplicates
and triplicates straightened out.

536
00:47:34,647 --> 00:47:38,551
Mr. Macy wouldn't have any way
of knowing what you sold.

537
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:42,788
That's why they have tissue paper.
- A nice, new order bank.

538
00:47:42,888 --> 00:47:44,423
First name:

539
00:47:44,523 --> 00:47:46,292
Beauregard...

540
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:49,725
...Jackson Pickett Burnside.

541
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:52,932
That's a lot.
You took up all that space.

542
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:56,368
Ms. Dennis. May I inquire
what is going on here?

543
00:47:56,468 --> 00:48:01,407
He was helping me with the slip.
- This young lady, Ms. Dennis...

544
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:06,412
...was having trouble with the sales
slip for skates. I was helping her.

545
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:10,549
Was there something unusual?
- Yes, he wanted to pay cash.

546
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:14,253
A Macy employee doesn't know
how to make a cash sale?

547
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:17,073
I'm a whiz at coDs.
You can tell.

548
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:21,955
Ms. Dennis, this sales book is a shambles.

549
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,030
Goodbye, everybody,
and Merry Christmas.

550
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,234
That young lady was doing
the best she knew.

551
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:31,303
I consider myself responsible for this.

552
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:33,739
The thing is a misunderstanding.

553
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,409
Don't forget the skates for the little  nippers.

554
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:40,603
Get them at Gimbels.

555
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:51,584
I'm not finished decorating yet.
You're home early.

556
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:56,055
They gave me my Christmas
vacation a little  bit early.

557
00:49:56,155 --> 00:49:59,558
I'm goad, because now
it fits with your vacation.

558
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:04,463
We won't miss even a day together.
Patrick, that's beautiful.

559
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:09,762
A genuine Picasso, huh?
His back and blue period.

560
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:19,603
It's almost a week till Christmas.

561
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:22,212
But open it.

562
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:25,459
Patrick, where did you get the money?

563
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:28,459
Mr. Leavitt down at the pawnshop...

564
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,058
...gave me a good price for
my hockey stick and microscope.

565
00:50:33,158 --> 00:50:37,563
I was getting tired of microbes.
- Now, you know you...

566
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:41,599
My, my, my, my.
- They're not quite diamonds.

567
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:48,468
Oh, darling, that's the most beautiful
bracelet I ever owned.

568
00:50:53,812 --> 00:50:55,812
Wiggle it.

569
00:50:56,949 --> 00:51:00,510
See, it doesn't make any noise.

570
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:06,792
I toad the man you had to have
a quiet one for when you go on-stage.

571
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:11,430
Wear it with your mink coat.
You'll make a sensation at Macy's.

572
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,566
I've already made a sensation at Macy's.

573
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:18,637
My mink coat is down at Mr. Leavitt's
with your microscope.

574
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:22,841
If we're going to have Christmas,
let's have it all around.

575
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:26,308
Norah, Ito. Come in, please.

576
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:31,307
Yes, Missy Dennis?

577
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:35,821
Merry Christmas, everyone.
- It isn't till Tuesday.

578
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:39,325
We need it now,
so let's go ahead and have it.

579
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:45,330
Norah, Ito, Patrick. I did want to pay
you some of your back salary...

580
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:49,668
Not another word about it.
We wouldn't think of leaving you.

581
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:52,999
No place else get job anyhow.

582
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:59,511
It isn't 17 jewels, but time isn't
worth all that decoration these days.

583
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:00,979
Thank you.

584
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,783
So French-smelling, I feel
as alluring as Theda Bara.

585
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:08,954
Golly, long pants at last.
Can I try them on right now?

586
00:52:09,054 --> 00:52:11,852
Right now.

587
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:17,563
Well, we've got a little  present
for you too, Ito and me.

588
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:21,997
I hope you're not going to be angry.
- What is it?

589
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:27,039
Ito had money put by and so did I,
for a rainy day, you might say.

590
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:32,244
We both figure it couldnt get much
wetter than it is right now.

591
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:38,249
We pay grocery and butcher bill.
Now Mr. Schultz no give nasty look.

592
00:52:45,524 --> 00:52:48,288
You're both so dear to me.

593
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:54,893
I'll pay you back one day.

594
00:52:57,169 --> 00:52:59,535
You know I will...

595
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:03,407
...if ever I can.

596
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:16,446
You're a loving woman.
You're odd, but you're loving.

597
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:19,291
We wish that you could  find a man...

598
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:24,795
...as wonderful and as fine
a gentleman as you are a fine lady.

599
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:29,635
What happened to Mr. Lindsay Woolsey?
He was a nice man.

600
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:33,398
Yes, he was a nice man,
but I sent him away.

601
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:37,943
I said no when I had money.
I couldnt say yes when I went broke.

602
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:40,043
Look.

603
00:53:40,145 --> 00:53:43,382
Besides, I have my own
fine gentleman, Norah...

604
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:47,612
...who gives me diamonds
or almost diamonds.

605
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:53,257
What we need is some music.
Some Christmas carols.

606
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,085
Patrick, go to her.

607
00:54:33,832 --> 00:54:37,734
Don't cry, Auntie Mame.
Please don't cry.

608
00:54:39,004 --> 00:54:42,371
Hell, we don't even have any Kleenex.

609
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:50,297
If that's Santa Claus,
tell him we've already had it.

610
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:54,919
Howdy. Excuse me,
but I wondered if...

611
00:54:58,156 --> 00:55:00,392
...I declare, it's a miracle.

612
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:04,147
That's what it is.
It's a Christmas miracle.

613
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:10,094
You've got no idea how happy I am.
I've been looking all over for you.

614
00:55:10,135 --> 00:55:14,640
Do you realize there are 97 Dennises
in the Manhattan directory?

615
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,976
I was just about ready to sail for Brooklyn.

616
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:20,374
Tell me why you came here.

617
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,316
I went back to apologize to you,
but you was gone.

618
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:27,553
I toad them Macy folks that they was wrong.

619
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:31,390
Why, a woman of your culture
and charm and refinement...

620
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,192
...should have an executive position...

621
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:39,231
...with a lot of hard hands to wrestle
with them pesky writing details.

622
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:41,133
Would you excuse me?

623
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:44,670
I want to pay off that taxi man,
so he can get home.

624
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:48,941
You left the taxi meter running
in the middies of the Depression?

625
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,081
Well, ma'am, I'm in oil.

626
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:55,747
It just keeps on gushing
and not much I can do about it.

627
00:55:55,847 --> 00:56:01,086
I'm all alone here and if you wouldn't
consider me too presumptuous...

628
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:04,456
...I'd be honored to squire you to dinner.

629
00:56:04,556 --> 00:56:09,461
No, thank you. We're celebrating.
I can't leave my little  family.

630
00:56:09,561 --> 00:56:13,131
I can understand that.
I'm knee-deep in family.

631
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:16,568
You ought to come to Georgia
and meet them all.

632
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:20,906
I think you'd just love Peckerwood.
- Who's Peckerwood?

633
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:25,377
No, ma'am. That's the name
of my little  ode plantation.

634
00:56:25,477 --> 00:56:30,315
Maybe, just for tonight, I could
be part of your little  ode family?

635
00:56:30,415 --> 00:56:33,852
And we'd have dinner together.
- I'm not dressed.

636
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:36,955
You look fine.
You don't need to worry.

637
00:56:37,055 --> 00:56:39,945
A little  powder and you'll look...

638
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,463
Just fine.

639
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:53,614
Look here, I'll tell that nice taxi man to wait.

640
00:56:53,772 --> 00:56:57,230
Marry him the minute he asks you.

641
00:56:57,442 --> 00:56:59,442
What's his name?

642
00:56:59,444 --> 00:57:01,780
You don't know his name.
- I do.

643
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:07,319
We are about to break bread with
Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside.

644
00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:11,123
Get your coat.
Ito, change your jacket. Now, hurry.

645
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:15,060
And you'd better bring your scarf,
it's cold outside.

646
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,815
Norah, don't forget to take your apron off.

647
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:24,501
Ito, hurry.

648
00:57:28,273 --> 00:57:31,009
I was going to give you this at dinner.

649
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:35,614
Norah, you're an angel.
There must be one for you too.

650
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,685
Me never believe in Santa.
Me beginning to change mind.

651
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:44,205
I never did think Santa
would have a Southern accent.

652
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,126
Merry Christmas from
Manny, Moe and Jack.

653
00:57:49,327 --> 00:57:55,022
Merry Christmas to y'all, Manny, Moe
and Jack. And a Happy New Year.

654
00:58:06,044 --> 00:58:07,145
Good morning.

655
00:58:07,245 --> 00:58:11,116
Where's my snuffbox?
What son of a dog stole my snuffbox?

656
00:58:11,216 --> 00:58:13,618
It's in your lap, Mother Burnside.

657
00:58:13,718 --> 00:58:17,122
Where is she?
I don't see any New York filly here.

658
00:58:17,222 --> 00:58:19,925
Just the same ode family standing around...

659
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:23,128
...waiting to be mentioned in my will.

660
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:27,138
Afternoon to y'all. Vultures.
- Good afternoon.

661
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:30,869
Now, Ms. Burnside,
that doesn't include me, does it?

662
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:36,669
No, Sally Cato, you ain't no vulture.
You're just a dead pigeon.

663
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:45,250
I can't see how you got
Beauregard out of your nest.

664
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:47,319
You shouldve sat on him.

665
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:51,499
Son? We got our sweet
Georgia peaches right here.

666
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:55,827
Don't know why you had to go
and bring back a Northern lemon.

667
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:59,498
Let's keep our grits going
in the right direction.

668
00:58:59,598 --> 00:59:03,835
My Auntie Mame, Miss Dennis,
says she'll be here in a moment.

669
00:59:03,935 --> 00:59:08,073
Well, now, what a lovable,
genteel little  gentleman.

670
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,976
You and my brother are gonna get along...

671
00:59:11,076 --> 00:59:14,913
...like a pair of colts in a pasture,
I can just tell.

672
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,013
Emory.

673
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:21,083
Your sister's nice.
- Nice?

674
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:26,792
You're plumb crazy. She's the meanest
damn filly in the entire South.

675
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:29,961
Mame, where are you?
We're all waiting on you.

676
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:33,398
I'm coming, Beau, sugar.
- There we are, honey.

677
00:59:33,498 --> 00:59:39,193
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm just busting to meet your mother.

678
00:59:40,005 --> 00:59:44,704
Mother, dear, I'd like
to present Miss Mame Dennis.

679
00:59:46,111 --> 00:59:47,679
Well, I...

680
00:59:47,779 --> 00:59:53,342
...I must say, Mrs. Burnside,
you're everything I ever expected.

681
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:57,811
And quite more.
- And these here are my...

682
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,227
Bless you.

683
01:00:02,327 --> 01:00:06,898
These are the rest of my kin.
The Jacksons, Picketts, Burnsides.

684
01:00:06,998 --> 01:00:09,301
This is Sally Cato MacDougal.

685
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:13,738
Stay out here and have a nice chat.
I'm gonna fix you a drink.

686
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:19,618
And then we're gonna run along down
and I'll have you meet my horses.

687
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:23,913
Well, I...

688
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:29,243
...I can't tell you how charming
it is to meet all of...

689
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:31,323
...you all.

690
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,559
Tell me, Miss Dennis...
May I call you 'Mame'?

691
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:37,429
Please do.
- And you call me Sally Cato.

692
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:39,231
Thank you.
- Tell me...

693
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:44,428
...was it horses brought you
and Beauregard together?

694
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:47,672
A horse is the most important
thing in his life.

695
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:53,807
I love riding. In New York, hardly a
day goes by, I don't have boots on.

696
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:57,682
Up every morning at dawn
for a ride through central Park.

697
01:00:57,782 --> 01:01:01,720
That settles it. In your honor,
we've got to have a hunt.

698
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,380
A hunt? Oh, a hunt. A hunt?.

699
01:01:04,589 --> 01:01:08,126
Everybody, Beauregard's gone
and surprised us all.

700
01:01:08,226 --> 01:01:13,598
She's a prominent Northern horsewoman.
Naturally, we've got to have a hunt.

701
01:01:13,698 --> 01:01:17,035
Dawn, tomorrow morning.
Everybody's invited.

702
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,804
Won't we have a lark?
The sun up...

703
01:01:19,904 --> 01:01:26,332
...leaping over hedges, jumping over
river gaps and the hounds yapping.

704
01:01:26,544 --> 01:01:30,282
Every eye in this county
will be on you tomorrow.

705
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:33,351
I didn't bring any of my riding togs.

706
01:01:33,451 --> 01:01:36,788
Don't worry, I got dozens
of things you can wear.

707
01:01:36,888 --> 01:01:39,183
What's your shoe size?
- 3B.

708
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:45,229
That's marvellous. Same as I wear.
You do ride astride, Mame, dear?

709
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:50,335
No, side-saddle. Daddy,
the colonel, insisted that I learn it.

710
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:56,207
He said it was the only way for a lady
to ride, so graceful. Silly of him.

711
01:01:56,307 --> 01:02:00,478
Nobody rides side-saddle now,
but it's the only way I know.

712
01:02:00,578 --> 01:02:02,873
Now, isn't that just grand?

713
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:07,352
I just happen to have a little
side-saddle that'll do you fine.

714
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:09,521
Refreshments?
- Beau, darling...

715
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:14,326
...we're having a hunt. Your sweet
Yankee girl is riding side-saddle.

716
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:19,331
I won't permit it. It's too dangerous.
- But, darling, she's insisted.

717
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:24,095
Well, anything that Mame says
she can do, she can do.

718
01:02:24,302 --> 01:02:27,138
I tell you, she's an amazing woman.

719
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:28,907
Mame, sugar...

720
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:34,104
...I'm just gonna hold my breath
until dawn tomorrow.

721
01:02:34,412 --> 01:02:36,642
Do that, honey.

722
01:02:42,987 --> 01:02:47,192
Stop looking at the pictures.
Read it to me, I'm listening.

723
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:49,292
'How to Ride a Horse.'

724
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:53,264
It says, 'Airways get on the horse
from the left side.'

725
01:02:53,364 --> 01:02:58,403
My left side or the horse's left side?
- It doesn't say. Listen to this.

726
01:02:58,503 --> 01:03:01,339
'Whenever approaching a strange mount...

727
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:05,010
...fix the animal in the eye
with a masterful gaze.

728
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:09,280
Remain calm, for a horse has
a highly developed sense of smell...

729
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,584
...and can react dangerously
when he smells fear.'

730
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:14,552
I hope he likes Chanel No. 5.

731
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:18,056
I didn't know this.
'Horses aren't native to America.'

732
01:03:18,156 --> 01:03:21,993
Read me something useful.
I'm about to go over the top.

733
01:03:22,093 --> 01:03:26,154
Clearing fences.
It says you should airways lean.

734
01:03:26,364 --> 01:03:30,101
Jumping water hazards.
'Don't mean. Sit erect.'

735
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:33,104
Don't lean. Sit erect.
Say your prayers.

736
01:03:33,204 --> 01:03:37,163
Be good to Norah and Ito after I'm gone.

737
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:42,947
I think Sally left a foot in this one.

738
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:46,778
Let me help you.
- No, darling. It's no use.

739
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:50,527
Why are you going through all this?

740
01:03:50,588 --> 01:03:55,560
If I can snag you an Uncle Beau,
all our problems will be solved.

741
01:03:55,660 --> 01:04:00,365
Besides, there's another minor,
relatively unimportant thing:

742
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:03,185
I happen to be in love with him.

743
01:04:03,334 --> 01:04:07,138
I like Beau. I like him a lot.
Then it's all settled.

744
01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:10,241
Not so fast,
he hasn't asked me anything yet.

745
01:04:10,341 --> 01:04:14,779
You dressed yet, Mame, honey?
- Come in, Beau, darling.

746
01:04:14,879 --> 01:04:20,044
Oh, my, how handsome you look.
- Well, likewise, Mame.

747
01:04:28,393 --> 01:04:31,763
Hold it steady,
I want to get a picture of this.

748
01:04:31,863 --> 01:04:37,301
That's it. Now, give me
a nice pose, Mame, darling.

749
01:04:37,502 --> 01:04:40,994
And big smile. That's a girl.

750
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:46,405
There we are. You have now
been immortalized in celluloid.

751
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:48,446
Patrick.

752
01:04:48,546 --> 01:04:53,711
You must have left it in my room.
I'll find it.

753
01:05:01,326 --> 01:05:03,326
Mame...

754
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,332
Thank you.

755
01:05:07,432 --> 01:05:12,604
I've got something to say. I'll have
to say it fast or not say it at all.

756
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:17,664
Talk slow then, Beau, darling.
I can listen fast.

757
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:23,840
Well, Mame, you and I don't
exactly come from the same world.

758
01:05:24,048 --> 01:05:30,317
Not that I think I'm worth...
There comes a time in every life...

759
01:05:32,156 --> 01:05:36,746
Mame, I'm just gonna have
to come right out and say it.

760
01:05:42,467 --> 01:05:45,231
Well, I'm gonna ask you to...

761
01:05:45,503 --> 01:05:47,869
Mame, would you?

762
01:05:48,072 --> 01:05:53,009
I mean, could  you...?
- Mame. Mame, darling.

763
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:55,304
It's me, Sally Cato.

764
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:59,951
I wanted to see if there was anything...
oh, hello, Beau.

765
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:02,747
Was I interrupting?

766
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:07,486
There's the signal, darling.
Come on, let's hurry.

767
01:06:08,226 --> 01:06:14,222
Well, shall we to the hounds?
- Yeah, I'd love to meet your family.

768
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:39,054
We almost thought you wasn't coming.
- Morning. Lovely day for a hunt.

769
01:06:39,257 --> 01:06:42,249
Sugar, you look absolutely dreamy.

770
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,557
Say, boys, you can bring
Miss Dennis' horse around now.

771
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:50,291
Well, what a break.

772
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:53,470
Glorious weather for the hunt.

773
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:57,397
I thought it might rain,
we'd call it off.

774
01:06:57,608 --> 01:07:02,080
Well, where are we riding to?
Outside of the hounds, of course.

775
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,950
It's a good 10-mile course,
for those that makes it.

776
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:11,078
I can try.
- This way, Auntie Mame.

777
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:17,728
Morning, Miss Dennis.
- Morning.

778
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:25,937
Well, has he?

779
01:07:26,037 --> 01:07:29,641
Not yet. So I die an ode maid
sometime before lunch.

780
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:33,778
No, you won't. You look convincing,
like a magazine cover.

781
01:07:33,878 --> 01:07:36,369
Horror Stories.

782
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:50,684
What's in there?
- That's the horse I picked out for you.

783
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:55,429
What's his name?
- Meditation.

784
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:10,948
I'll trip you. You'd only break a leg.

785
01:08:11,048 --> 01:08:15,723
I can't disgrace Beau,
not in front of all these people.

786
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:21,693
Fix the animal in the eye
with a masterful gaze.

787
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:26,423
Fix the master in the eye
with an animal gaze.

788
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:30,533
Fix the aster in the maze
with an animal guy.

789
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:36,634
You look fit. They're bringing
the fox up from the icehouse.

790
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:39,464
Come on, let's go, everybody.

791
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:52,641
Goodbye, Yankee gal.

792
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:20,611
Where does she think she's going?
- Look at him go.

793
01:10:20,711 --> 01:10:25,148
Fall off. Fall off.
- Look out for that flood wall.

794
01:10:25,349 --> 01:10:30,309
Auntie Mame, fall off. Fall off.
- Look out. Look out.

795
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:37,484
Dangled if she didn't sail
clear over it. No hands.

796
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:25,276
Look at her. She's passing everybody.

797
01:11:25,376 --> 01:11:29,280
She's passing the master
of the hounds. Very bad form.

798
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,575
She's passing the dogs.

799
01:11:31,749 --> 01:11:35,829
Mother of Jefferson Davis,
she's passing the fox.

800
01:11:39,357 --> 01:11:43,127
Ms. Burnside. I was driving by.
I thought I saw...

801
01:11:43,227 --> 01:11:47,164
That couldnt be Meditation.
- Yes, fine bit of horseflesh.

802
01:11:47,264 --> 01:11:50,233
He's a killer. I gotta stop this.

803
01:11:58,609 --> 01:12:01,074
They're headed back this way.

804
01:12:05,783 --> 01:12:11,308
Stay out of the flowerbed.
Get that horse out of my bougainvillea.

805
01:12:13,424 --> 01:12:16,059
She's heading for the icehouse.

806
01:12:31,442 --> 01:12:35,344
That's my car. That's county property.

807
01:12:44,282 --> 01:12:45,970
Mame.

808
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,973
Mame, where are you?
- She come this way.

809
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:52,276
There you are.
Darling, are you all right?

810
01:12:52,376 --> 01:12:56,614
If I hadn't grabbed on to this,
I'd have been in Nova Scotia.

811
01:12:56,714 --> 01:13:00,818
What happened to the fox?
- Poor thing is all tuckered out.

812
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,250
Oh, my little  love.

813
01:13:03,454 --> 01:13:09,829
As county veterinarian, I commanded you
two years ago to destroy that horse.

814
01:13:09,893 --> 01:13:13,931
Letting her ride this horse,
superb horsewoman that she is...

815
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:16,233
...that was premeditated murder.

816
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:20,871
Let's have three cheers, everybody,
for my little  Yankee.

817
01:13:20,971 --> 01:13:25,431
What a seat that woman has.
What a magnificent seat.

818
01:13:25,642 --> 01:13:29,179
Look here, everybody,
I want three cheers...

819
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:34,051
...for the future Mrs. Beauregard
Jackson Pickett Burnside.

820
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:35,786
Hip, hip...
- Hooray.

821
01:13:35,886 --> 01:13:37,886
Hip, hip...
- Hooray.

822
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,990
Emory, come on home.

823
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,857
Hot damn.
My sister's gonna bust a gut.

824
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:48,465
What are y'all standing around for?

825
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:52,469
Come back to the house.
We'll have a glass of whiskey.

826
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:56,130
Oh, Beau.
- Come on, Mame, darling.

827
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:59,241
Here we are. Take it easy, now.

828
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:04,163
Mame, I'm sorry about making
my proposal so public...

829
01:14:04,248 --> 01:14:08,552
...but I'm gonna do everything I can
to make you happy.

830
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:13,190
Of course, you'll have to educate me.
Make me more cosmopolitan.

831
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:18,095
For a honeymoon, let's take a trip
around the world for a few years.

832
01:14:18,195 --> 01:14:20,891
Oh, Beau. That's...

833
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,900
Darling, excuse me a minute.
- Sure.

834
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,437
My little  love.
- Congratulations, Auntie Mame.

835
01:14:29,638 --> 01:14:33,939
Your Auntie Mame's in love and very happy.

836
01:14:34,142 --> 01:14:37,042
I won't see you for a long time.

837
01:14:37,249 --> 01:14:41,842
Patrick, nothing can ever really separate us.

838
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,620
You'll join us on all your vacations.

839
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,191
The rest of the time,
you'll be busy at school.

840
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:51,160
I'll just have two men instead of one.

841
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:54,399
And I'll write to you every day,
I promise.

842
01:14:54,499 --> 01:14:59,168
You don't think I'd run off and
abandon you to the Babcocks, do you?

843
01:14:59,268 --> 01:15:02,504
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

844
01:15:02,604 --> 01:15:06,041
Now let me see you smile.
I want to see it.

845
01:15:06,141 --> 01:15:10,042
Where is it? That's my boy.

846
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:16,349
Can I ask you just one question?
How did you stay on that horse?

847
01:15:16,885 --> 01:15:23,051
It's like New Haven with the bracelet.
I got stuck, but at the other end.

848
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:35,998
'Dear Auntie Mame: I plan to spend this
holiday with Mr. Babcock in Darien.'

849
01:16:36,098 --> 01:16:40,518
Hold it right there, darling.
- Now, no higher, Beau.

850
01:16:41,103 --> 01:16:44,108
'Junior Babcock and I have fun there...

851
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:49,110
...and I have met the kids from all
the best families in Connecticut.'

852
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,210
Oh, dear.

853
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:08,900
I have a feeling we should be
getting back. Patrick needs me.

854
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,626
That last one was the best one yet.
- Good, darling.

855
01:17:14,741 --> 01:17:19,075
Now, did you put film in this time?
- I sure did.

856
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,238
Oh, dang.
- Up, up, Rover. Up, up.

857
01:17:32,492 --> 01:17:34,762
Mrs. Burnside.
- Mr. Babcock.

858
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:38,693
So good to see you again.
- Thank you. Nice to see you.

859
01:17:38,793 --> 01:17:40,793
Darling.

860
01:17:41,903 --> 01:17:43,999
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

861
01:17:44,099 --> 01:17:46,932
Mame. Up here, Mame, honey.

862
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:49,855
That's it. Give me a nice smile.

863
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,140
I gotcha.

864
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:03,750
Mame, honey. Look up here.

865
01:18:03,957 --> 01:18:07,854
Come, Patrick. Do be careful, darling.

866
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:13,517
Now, give me a nice smile.
Patrick, take off your hat.

867
01:18:13,728 --> 01:18:16,252
Now, give me a nice smile.

868
01:18:16,465 --> 01:18:18,465
That's it.

869
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:21,866
I got it.

870
01:18:44,831 --> 01:18:46,831
Dennis?
- Hey, Dennis.

871
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:51,594
Sign here.
- It's another one for you. Dennis.

872
01:18:51,766 --> 01:18:54,365
Siam this time.

873
01:18:55,804 --> 01:18:57,804
Thanks.

874
01:19:00,008 --> 01:19:02,306
Siam. Dear Patrick:

875
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:08,036
Here's a handy woman to have
around the house. Love, Auntie Mame.'

876
01:19:21,062 --> 01:19:25,163
Here we are, darling.
You all right?

877
01:19:26,373 --> 01:19:28,941
Next time, let's take the elevator.

878
01:19:29,041 --> 01:19:33,461
It's 1o, ooo feet up.
We only got another mile to go.

879
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:36,683
Why don't you stay here and rest a while?

880
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:39,316
I'll go up and get some film of you.

881
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:42,901
I'll finish Patrick's letter.
- All right.

882
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:47,929
'Have to dash.
Dinner at Uncle Dwight's.

883
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:52,363
That's Babcock,
the baboon-faced boy to you.

884
01:19:52,561 --> 01:19:56,471
Ode Babcock's introducing me
to all the blond heiresses...

885
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:59,404
...on the Eastern seaboard.'

886
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:02,798
Blond heiresses? Dwight?

887
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:04,775
Beau? Beau.

888
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:09,649
I knew that letter was worrying you.
I already made reservations back.

889
01:20:09,749 --> 01:20:13,009
Good. Well then, let's get back down.

890
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:16,918
Wait a minute,
I still got a little  more film left.

891
01:20:17,018 --> 01:20:20,843
Mame, would you mind
stepping back just a bit?

892
01:20:22,662 --> 01:20:26,766
I'd rather not.
- Never mind, I'll scale up higher.

893
01:20:26,866 --> 01:20:29,056
Now, Beau, no higher.

894
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:33,201
Take this.
It keeps on getting in my way.

895
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:36,371
Take hold of the other end for your balance.

896
01:20:36,471 --> 01:20:40,909
Don't you worry.
Just be looking out at the view there.

897
01:20:41,009 --> 01:20:46,641
Hold it now, will you?
Now, you hold on tight while I re-focus.

898
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:28,750
Heavens, this looks like
the main chapel of a funeral parlor.

899
01:21:28,919 --> 01:21:33,229
Haven't Norah and Ito been alerted?
- They'll be here tomorrow.

900
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,661
What's that thing supposed to be?
- A Dictaphone.

901
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:41,972
She'll never use it. Patrick's carried
all this junk up here for nothing.

902
01:21:42,072 --> 01:21:47,275
Mame can't stay still long enough
to write a postcard, let alone a book.

903
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:51,147
No, he was right.
Mame can't go on living  in a vacuum.

904
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:54,746
She's airways got to have a project.
- She's got one.

905
01:21:54,846 --> 01:21:59,984
Now, she's the tragic queen.
She's having such fun being miserable.

906
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:05,290
All she's done for 1o months is revisit
the places she's been with Beau.

907
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:10,694
Eight times, she climbed the Matterhorn
to throw rose petals down the glacier.

908
01:22:10,794 --> 01:22:13,066
I should have gone to meet her.

909
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:15,772
I haven't seen her since the funeral.

910
01:22:15,872 --> 01:22:19,371
Wasn't it just like Mame
to keep him till I got there?

911
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:25,421
Listen, you cynic, she was in love
with him. She's changed, I tell you.

912
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:28,579
Look, I'll get some champagne.

913
01:22:28,785 --> 01:22:31,083
I'll answer it.

914
01:22:38,089 --> 01:22:40,353
Mame.

915
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:43,397
She can't have changed that much.

916
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,830
I'm from Speed-o.
- You're what?

917
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:49,200
Patrick called a secretarial service.
Your name?

918
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,068
Agnes Gooch.

919
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:55,979
You'll be taking dictation from
Mrs. Burnside. She talks very fast.

920
01:22:56,079 --> 01:23:00,650
Speed-o won't let anybody out
who can't do 18o words a minute.

921
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,947
I'm over 200.
- No, you're not.

922
01:23:04,155 --> 01:23:08,235
She may let loose
with a million words and ideas.

923
01:23:08,386 --> 01:23:11,106
Soak them all up, like a sponge.

924
01:23:11,161 --> 01:23:14,731
Speed-o better have symbols
for four-letter words.

925
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:17,528
Lindsay, Mame will never write a book.

926
01:23:17,628 --> 01:23:21,666
But Patrick got a fella to help her.
He'll be here at 3:00.

927
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:23,766
What fella?

928
01:23:29,674 --> 01:23:31,876
That's the signal.
- What signal?

929
01:23:31,976 --> 01:23:37,642
Patrick wants us to surprise Mame.
Come on, hide. In there, quick.

930
01:23:41,352 --> 01:23:44,219
You too, Miss Gooch.

931
01:23:45,223 --> 01:23:48,326
Why are you ringing?
Don't you have a key?

932
01:23:48,426 --> 01:23:52,055
Oh, of course. What am I thinking of?

933
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:58,670
Welcome home.

934
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:02,729
Good ode Beekman Place.
Airways so loyal.

935
01:24:02,946 --> 01:24:08,112
No matter how far I go, it waits
for me. I hope you used it weekends.

936
01:24:08,212 --> 01:24:13,650
No, I didn't. I usually go from school
to Connecticut, to Uncle Dwight's.

937
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:17,393
I did rather expect Vera
to be down at the boat.

938
01:24:17,493 --> 01:24:20,992
I wouldn't let her.
I wanted to be alone with you.

939
01:24:21,092 --> 01:24:24,721
Patrick. My little  Patrick.

940
01:24:24,929 --> 01:24:27,557
Now, open your presents.

941
01:24:27,765 --> 01:24:33,403
I can't get over it. Every time I see
you, you're taller and more grown-up.

942
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:38,243
Oh, golly, short pants. At last.
Can I try them on right now?

943
01:24:38,343 --> 01:24:39,777
Right now.

944
01:24:39,877 --> 01:24:44,508
Surprise. Welcome home, Mame.

945
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,544
Vera.

946
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:53,750
And dear, staunch, stalwart Lindsay.

947
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:58,434
How good of you both to rally
around this bereft ode woman.

948
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:01,437
Doesn't she look great?
- How can you tell?

949
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:04,536
Couldn't you have gone to purple by now?

950
01:25:04,636 --> 01:25:09,333
Come on, Auntie Mame,
champagne and fishberry jam.

951
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:12,982
No, Patrick. The bubbles
no longer tickle my nose.

952
01:25:13,082 --> 01:25:16,748
I've given up alcohol,
along with everything else.

953
01:25:16,848 --> 01:25:21,057
It's wonderful of you all.
Very touching, but... what's that?

954
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:25,321
It's your Dictaphone and your typewriter.

955
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:29,791
And what's that?
- I'm your sponge.

956
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:33,229
This is your secretary.
- My secretary?

957
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:37,869
Yes. You'll write your autobiography.
- Me? Write a book?

958
01:25:37,969 --> 01:25:40,643
No one's had a more colourful life.

959
01:25:40,743 --> 01:25:45,076
You've known fascinating people:
Winston Churchill, Gandhi, me.

960
01:25:45,176 --> 01:25:49,747
You'll be so busy digging up the past,
you won't think of the present.

961
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:52,750
And I promise to publish it.
- Oh, I see.

962
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:55,570
This is some sort of conspiracy.

963
01:25:55,585 --> 01:25:59,729
Some trumped-up occupational therapy,
like basket weaving.

964
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:04,233
I swear, it'll be a bestseller.
And you'd be doing me a favor.

965
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:08,595
My memoirs? Patrick, my drink.
- Champagne?

966
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:14,678
Anything, just make it double. I see
it in two volumes. Boxed, like Proust.

967
01:26:14,778 --> 01:26:19,849
Let me see. Chapter one, page one.
- She's supposed to start right now?

968
01:26:19,949 --> 01:26:26,409
This isn't so difficult. Another drink.
Where was I? Chapter one, page one...

969
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:30,121
...what are you writing?
- 'Chapter one, page one.

970
01:26:30,221 --> 01:26:35,493
This isn't so difficult. Another drink.
Where was I? What are you writing?'

971
01:26:35,593 --> 01:26:37,433
She is fast.

972
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:39,269
You're off and running.

973
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:44,233
Should I do this? It'll take up all
my time. I came home to be with you.

974
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:48,206
After all, you can't be with me.
No women in the dorm.

975
01:26:48,306 --> 01:26:50,680
I forgot, you're grown-up now.

976
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:55,050
You don't need me anymore.
Nobody needs me anymore. It's sad...

977
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,983
How do you turn her off?

978
01:26:57,083 --> 01:27:00,618
The most important thing is
to have a good beginning.

979
01:27:00,718 --> 01:27:04,552
Wait for your collaborator.
- Collaborator?

980
01:27:04,756 --> 01:27:08,525
Yes. My friend got a kind
of editor to work with you.

981
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:11,220
Fella named o'Bannion.

982
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:16,272
You don't trust me to write
my own life? He got me a ghost.

983
01:27:16,372 --> 01:27:20,004
It's not a ghost.
- I see it all now. A ghost-writer.

984
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:23,846
I won't expose my life
to some beer-drinking Irishman...

985
01:27:23,946 --> 01:27:27,850
...who leads a low, common life
in some Third Avenue bar.

986
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:32,188
You don't trust me to write my life?
Who else could  write it?

987
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:34,583
Whoever this creature is...

988
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,659
Mr. O'Bannion to see you.

989
01:27:39,696 --> 01:27:44,541
I was asked to drop by to meet
the fabulous Mrs. Burnside.

990
01:27:48,071 --> 01:27:50,795
You are she, of course.

991
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:55,336
I can sense the aura
of creative vitality about you.

992
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:09,157
Won't you come in, Mr. O'Bannion?

993
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:18,129
I thought by way
of introduction, Mrs. Burnside...

994
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:23,272
...I'd present you with a slim volume
of my poems, The Parched Garden.

995
01:28:23,372 --> 01:28:26,205
What a lovely title. Thank you.

996
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:28,619
Do you mind if I sit down?

997
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:33,244
That long ride up in the elevator,
it's after getting me dizzy.

998
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:37,934
I'll get you a bit of water.
- No, please don't bother.

999
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:41,823
Of course, a bit of champagne,
if it's handy.

1000
01:28:41,853 --> 01:28:43,853
Patrick.

1001
01:28:44,025 --> 01:28:46,790
It seems to help.

1002
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,460
Thank you.

1003
01:28:53,764 --> 01:28:56,033
It's the other one.

1004
01:28:59,637 --> 01:29:02,628
Tell me, how did it happen?

1005
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:06,325
Well, it was in 1922.
The Great Rebellion.

1006
01:29:07,783 --> 01:29:13,683
Even a lad of 15 can feel strongly
about his country's independence.

1007
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:22,923
How nice.

1008
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:27,066
Tell me, Mr. O'Bannion.

1009
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:31,038
Do you think you and I
can ever get anyplace?

1010
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:35,041
With the book, I mean.

1011
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:38,203
Well, we've both known sorrow.

1012
01:29:39,115 --> 01:29:43,450
I feel that you and I are going
to create something.

1013
01:29:44,321 --> 01:29:46,653
Something beautiful.

1014
01:30:01,571 --> 01:30:05,402
Actually, my child, it was so sad.
Mother died in childbirth.

1015
01:30:05,502 --> 01:30:09,479
It was a dreadful thing.
And Father travelled all the time.

1016
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:13,182
How difficult he was.
But I must be fair to Father.

1017
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:19,062
Remind me to do a whole new chapter
about him. No, no, take that out.

1018
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:24,455
And I had to start working when I was 8.

1019
01:30:24,555 --> 01:30:28,826
I went next door and said,
'can I baby-sit? Can I do something?'

1020
01:30:28,926 --> 01:30:34,870
After all, I was a child. I said,
'I need clothes. Parties. Pretties.'

1021
01:30:56,354 --> 01:30:58,354
Please.

1022
01:30:58,556 --> 01:31:00,995
Please, Miss Gooch.

1023
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:07,198
How can I court the muse
with all that clackety-clack?

1024
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:13,270
I'm sorry. I'm only taking off
what Mrs. Burnside dictated.

1025
01:31:13,437 --> 01:31:17,146
Everything Mrs. Burnside
dictates is so wonderful.

1026
01:31:17,246 --> 01:31:20,738
When I think of the things she's done...

1027
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:25,555
...and think of the things
I haven't done, I could  just die.

1028
01:31:25,655 --> 01:31:28,586
But it's so exciting being in this house.

1029
01:31:28,686 --> 01:31:31,746
Just imagine, a Japanese houseboy...

1030
01:31:31,889 --> 01:31:34,916
...all those artistic friends...

1031
01:31:35,092 --> 01:31:38,157
...and you, Mr. O'Bannion.

1032
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:42,059
I'll get it, Brian. Hello.

1033
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:44,238
Hello, Lindsay.

1034
01:31:44,302 --> 01:31:46,462
It's coming along.

1035
01:31:46,637 --> 01:31:52,014
Well, it's only been three months.
Brian is polishing and perfecting it.

1036
01:31:52,114 --> 01:31:54,775
A party? Oh, I'd...

1037
01:31:55,951 --> 01:31:59,083
No, I'm afraid not.
Brian couldnt possibly...

1038
01:31:59,183 --> 01:32:01,183
...what is it, my dear?

1039
01:32:01,352 --> 01:32:04,789
Lindsay feels that Warner Bros.
Might pay for our book...

1040
01:32:04,889 --> 01:32:11,179
...as a vehicle for Bette Davis. He's
meeting Jack Warner tonight, but I...

1041
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:16,701
Mrs. Burnside and I couldn't
possibly allow our work...

1042
01:32:16,801 --> 01:32:19,503
...to be defiled by a movie company.

1043
01:32:19,603 --> 01:32:24,006
But, just as a courtesy,
we'll come and discuss it.

1044
01:32:24,613 --> 01:32:27,805
About 8:3o? A back tie?

1045
01:32:27,978 --> 01:32:31,354
All right, and thank you very much.
Goodbye.

1046
01:32:31,454 --> 01:32:36,653
Brian, you accepted. It might do you
good to get back in the world.

1047
01:32:36,753 --> 01:32:40,750
Here's what you dictated.
- Thank you.

1048
01:32:40,925 --> 01:32:44,866
And here's what Mr. O'Bannion edited.

1049
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:49,900
Mr. O'Bannion and I are going to work,
so why don't you do...

1050
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,536
...whatever it is you do to relax.

1051
01:32:52,636 --> 01:32:54,644
Thank you, Mrs. Burnside.

1052
01:32:54,744 --> 01:32:59,333
I think I'll just fix myself a Dr. Pepper.

1053
01:33:03,487 --> 01:33:06,617
I'm worried.
We have little  to show Mr. Warner.

1054
01:33:06,717 --> 01:33:11,227
We'll tell him the story. How long
will it take to finish this book?

1055
01:33:11,327 --> 01:33:14,956
Flaubert spent 13 years on Madame Bovary.

1056
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,435
Where were we?
- Give us our last sentence.

1057
01:33:19,535 --> 01:33:21,971
'My puberty in Buffalo was drab.'

1058
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:27,265
Oh, no, no. It has no majesty.
'Drab' is such a drab word.

1059
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:32,574
How right you are, Brian.
It has no afflatus.

1060
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:36,018
What about 'bleak'?

1061
01:33:36,118 --> 01:33:39,640
Bleak? Bleak.
How bleak was my puberty.

1062
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:43,893
Bleak Buffalo. Hear how
the words cling to each other?

1063
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:48,692
Like a man and woman in each other's
arms. Listen to the words sing.

1064
01:33:48,792 --> 01:33:52,825
How bleak was my puberty.

1065
01:33:55,132 --> 01:33:57,132
I'm sorry.

1066
01:33:57,239 --> 01:34:02,978
Come, Mame. Let us lie down in front
of the fire and stare at the flames.

1067
01:34:03,078 --> 01:34:06,982
It will help stir the flames of our inspiration.

1068
01:34:07,082 --> 01:34:09,278
Yes. Well, now, Brian.

1069
01:34:09,452 --> 01:34:13,250
Will the general public understand
all this symbolism?

1070
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,087
'Like an echo from the caves
of Kakamora...

1071
01:34:16,187 --> 01:34:20,653
...I came forth whilst Deirdre
wept cool tears.'

1072
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:25,733
Wouldn't it be simpler to say, 'The
day I was born, it rained in Buffalo'?

1073
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:28,499
It's drab.
- It's drab, but it's clear.

1074
01:34:28,599 --> 01:34:34,719
Here is clarity. I stayed awake half
the night to sift it from obscurity.

1075
01:34:34,778 --> 01:34:38,674
N the blank Gray midnight
of me haunted Garden

1076
01:34:38,843 --> 01:34:43,887
Your soft form appeared raining
kisses on the parched earth of me lips.

1077
01:34:43,987 --> 01:34:46,650
What's come over you?
Now, you mustn't.

1078
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:51,489
Besides, it takes Agnes no time at all
to knock off a Dr. Pepper.

1079
01:34:51,589 --> 01:34:53,589
Brian, you mustn't.

1080
01:34:53,591 --> 01:34:57,266
Do not Withdraw this Wondrous Water,
for Without you...

1081
01:34:57,366 --> 01:34:59,727
...I rinsed out the glass.

1082
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:02,458
Aren't you neat?

1083
01:35:04,874 --> 01:35:10,207
It came from the fiber of my being.
That's why I'm so tired today.

1084
01:35:10,307 --> 01:35:15,909
You could  revitalize me
with a single, motherly kiss.

1085
01:35:18,182 --> 01:35:20,022
What's happened to you?

1086
01:35:20,122 --> 01:35:23,097
I'm revitalized.
- You're recharged.

1087
01:35:23,187 --> 01:35:27,096
Don't you come near me.
You're ode enough to be my mother.

1088
01:35:27,196 --> 01:35:30,360
I'm going to your room...
I mean, my room. Ito.

1089
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:34,566
You'll kill yourself.
- What a way to die. I'm mad for you.

1090
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:40,531
You've poured your strength into me.
And I want to pour it right back.

1091
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:46,377
This is ridiculous.

1092
01:35:46,477 --> 01:35:50,554
It's like having a crush
on your teacher. Or your analyst.

1093
01:35:50,654 --> 01:35:52,654
Stop it.

1094
01:35:52,988 --> 01:35:54,785
Hello, anybody?

1095
01:35:54,885 --> 01:35:56,885
Patrick.

1096
01:35:57,291 --> 01:35:59,291
Hello, Auntie Mame.

1097
01:36:00,391 --> 01:36:04,266
Hello, Dennis.
- I'm so goad to see you, darling.

1098
01:36:04,366 --> 01:36:08,138
Mrs. Burnside and I were
just working on the book.

1099
01:36:08,238 --> 01:36:12,775
I bet that's gonna be some book.
- Why are you home from school?

1100
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:14,608
I had to talk to you.

1101
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:19,808
You have things to talk about.
I'll go to my room and change.

1102
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:24,483
His room? Is he living  here?
- Of course.

1103
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:27,084
He was living  in some miserable fiat.

1104
01:36:27,184 --> 01:36:30,254
Since we're working together
night and day...

1105
01:36:30,354 --> 01:36:33,491
Let me tell you something about
that spiritual Irish poet...

1106
01:36:33,591 --> 01:36:38,187
You don't have to tell me a thing.
It looks very cozy.

1107
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:43,272
For a minute, you sounded like
someone from the Knickerbocker Bank.

1108
01:36:43,372 --> 01:36:46,401
Please get o'Bannion out of here.
Right away.

1109
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:50,441
I beg your pardon?
- I don't want him in this house.

1110
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:55,579
Aren't you taking rather an imperious
tone? Mr. O'Bannion is my colleague.

1111
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,514
Colleague, my foot.
Gloria would never understand...

1112
01:37:00,684 --> 01:37:03,416
...who is Gloria?

1113
01:37:03,586 --> 01:37:06,930
Auntie Mame, listen to me.
I've met a girl.

1114
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:10,770
I've been going with her for several months.

1115
01:37:11,228 --> 01:37:14,595
She's a very special girl, and...

1116
01:37:16,467 --> 01:37:19,275
...I should have toad you about her before.

1117
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:23,312
I would have, but I knew you
were tied up with the book...

1118
01:37:23,412 --> 01:37:25,209
...and everything.

1119
01:37:25,309 --> 01:37:27,776
And until now it wasn't definite.

1120
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:29,876
What's definite now?

1121
01:37:30,014 --> 01:37:32,783
Glorias the girl.
That's what's definite.

1122
01:37:32,883 --> 01:37:37,487
You're going to meet her. Tonight.
- You didn't leave her in the car?

1123
01:37:37,587 --> 01:37:41,858
I left her at her girlfriends house.
She wanted to spruce up.

1124
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:45,768
I'd better spruce up too.
- I'll bring her in 1o minutes.

1125
01:37:45,868 --> 01:37:48,066
I'll have my face all organized.

1126
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:51,651
What did you do with me evening slippers?

1127
01:37:51,707 --> 01:37:55,532
It's all right. I found them.
- Wait a minute.

1128
01:37:56,807 --> 01:37:59,435
If he's still in the house...

1129
01:37:59,615 --> 01:38:02,779
...I'm not gonna bring Gloria back here.

1130
01:38:02,879 --> 01:38:04,879
May I inquire why?

1131
01:38:05,988 --> 01:38:10,323
Gloria is a very sensitive
and well brought-up girl.

1132
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:13,324
I don't want you flaunting
your new flames...

1133
01:38:13,424 --> 01:38:16,824
...and ode peccadilloes in front of her.

1134
01:38:17,794 --> 01:38:20,826
Then why bring her here at all?

1135
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:24,640
Want to know the truth?
I've been trying to avoid it.

1136
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:27,135
She wanted to meet you.

1137
01:38:28,138 --> 01:38:30,299
I see.

1138
01:38:30,474 --> 01:38:33,649
You dropped by to see that I was all...

1139
01:38:33,749 --> 01:38:38,054
...scrubbed up and presentable
for inspection, is that it?

1140
01:38:38,154 --> 01:38:39,917
Yes.

1141
01:38:40,017 --> 01:38:42,651
And to tell you that while she's here...

1142
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:46,763
...for five minutes to try to act
like a normal human being.

1143
01:38:46,863 --> 01:38:50,232
Glorias from a very conservative family.

1144
01:38:50,332 --> 01:38:52,967
She doesn't have to know about things...

1145
01:38:53,067 --> 01:38:57,402
...ordinary mortals
simply don't have to know about.

1146
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:04,541
Should she know you've turned into
one of the most beastly, bourgeois...

1147
01:39:04,641 --> 01:39:08,721
...Babbitty little  snobs
on the Eastern seaboard?

1148
01:39:12,454 --> 01:39:18,319
Or will you be able to make that
quite clear without any help from me?

1149
01:39:22,364 --> 01:39:25,351
Well, it's been nice knowing you.

1150
01:39:27,237 --> 01:39:29,237
Patrick?

1151
01:39:30,405 --> 01:39:32,405
Auntie Mame?

1152
01:39:34,243 --> 01:39:37,799
Darling. I love you so.

1153
01:39:37,975 --> 01:39:43,185
I'd do anything for you. I'd denounce
Calvin Coolidge as a Bolshevik.

1154
01:39:43,285 --> 01:39:48,419
Gloria had better like you or
I'll bill her one square in the chops.

1155
01:39:48,519 --> 01:39:54,469
I'll get him out of here and have
the whole place fumigated. I promise.

1156
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:08,801
Thanks, Auntie Mame.

1157
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:33,533
Brian?

1158
01:40:36,705 --> 01:40:41,038
Why aren't you dressed?
- Would you mind going without me?

1159
01:40:41,138 --> 01:40:44,208
You want me to go alone?
- Something came up.

1160
01:40:44,308 --> 01:40:49,678
Hurry up and get dressed.
I am not going to that party alone.

1161
01:41:08,131 --> 01:41:14,434
If there's nothing more you wanted,
I just thought I'd go up to my room.

1162
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,634
Agnes.

1163
01:41:26,683 --> 01:41:29,122
I wonder.

1164
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:32,753
Is anything wrong, Mrs. Burnside?

1165
01:41:35,998 --> 01:41:39,291
You're coming out.
- Where?

1166
01:41:39,462 --> 01:41:42,066
You know, you have very beautiful eyes.

1167
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:44,668
Take these glasses off forever.

1168
01:41:44,768 --> 01:41:47,204
I can't see out of my right eye.

1169
01:41:47,304 --> 01:41:51,554
Then look out of your left one.
Now, now, now, now.

1170
01:41:51,613 --> 01:41:54,475
You do have a bust.

1171
01:41:54,645 --> 01:41:58,115
Where have you been hiding that
all these months?

1172
01:41:58,215 --> 01:42:01,223
What do you call those?
- Orthopaedic oxfords.

1173
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:04,858
Kick them off. Now take
off your clothes. Norah, Ito.

1174
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,451
There's a man in the house.

1175
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:11,433
Will you stop being a goose
and get these clothes off?

1176
01:42:11,533 --> 01:42:15,018
Norah? Ito? Where are you
when I need you?

1177
01:42:15,037 --> 01:42:19,799
I don't have a very clear picture
of what's going on.

1178
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,970
Now, Agnes, dear...

1179
01:42:22,109 --> 01:42:26,515
...I am sending you to that party
tonight with Mr. O'Bannion.

1180
01:42:26,615 --> 01:42:30,808
I couldn't. I'm too nervous.

1181
01:42:31,214 --> 01:42:33,744
This will calm you down.

1182
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:37,592
Oh, no. Spirits do
the most terrible things to me.

1183
01:42:37,692 --> 01:42:41,687
I'm not the same girl.
- What's wrong with that?

1184
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:43,961
Will it mix with Dr. Pepper?

1185
01:42:44,061 --> 01:42:46,625
He'll love it. Drink.

1186
01:42:48,036 --> 01:42:50,500
Norah, go get my back Patou velvet.

1187
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:54,275
Ito, lay out my cosmetics,
my cold cream, everything.

1188
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:57,868
You see, me be charley of the Ritz.

1189
01:42:58,875 --> 01:43:00,482
Come, child.

1190
01:43:00,582 --> 01:43:05,949
I think I know what you want me to do.
I'm not a bit sure I want to do it.

1191
01:43:06,049 --> 01:43:07,890
Agnes, where is your spine?

1192
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:11,759
You've taken my dictation for weeks and
you don't get the message of my book.

1193
01:43:11,859 --> 01:43:14,157
Live, that's the message.
- Live?

1194
01:43:14,257 --> 01:43:18,328
Yes. Life is a banquet and
most poor suckers are starving.

1195
01:43:18,428 --> 01:43:22,762
Now, come on, Agnes, live.
Come, child. Live.

1196
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:35,851
The whole place has gone nuts.

1197
01:43:35,951 --> 01:43:40,371
She'll never make a silk purse
out of that sow's ear.

1198
01:43:41,885 --> 01:43:44,583
Mrs. Burnside, I can't breathe.

1199
01:43:44,754 --> 01:43:49,750
Good, good. If you can breathe,
it isn't tight enough.

1200
01:43:52,095 --> 01:43:56,566
And why aren't you dressed?
- I am not going to that party tonight.

1201
01:43:56,666 --> 01:44:01,165
Then I'm not going either.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

1202
01:44:01,337 --> 01:44:06,109
Well, you can use the Duesenberg.

1203
01:44:08,044 --> 01:44:11,208
And I have a date for you.

1204
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:13,416
Agnes?

1205
01:44:13,884 --> 01:44:17,217
Agnes?. You can't expect...

1206
01:44:17,387 --> 01:44:20,657
...would you ask Toscanini
to lead a harmonica band?

1207
01:44:20,757 --> 01:44:24,099
I won't take Gooch,
she's an offense to the sight.

1208
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:28,165
It's good her mother, the countess
de Gooch, can't hear you.

1209
01:44:28,265 --> 01:44:30,329
She'd pull your beard.

1210
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:33,702
Countess? You're joking.

1211
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:38,375
Surely you've heard of the de Gooches?
Second wealthiest bankers.

1212
01:44:38,475 --> 01:44:41,467
Fabulous estate at Newport.

1213
01:44:41,645 --> 01:44:46,416
This child is just doing this
for a little  literary experience.

1214
01:44:46,516 --> 01:44:49,456
Agnes. No, no, no.

1215
01:44:49,624 --> 01:44:54,288
Agnes, head up, dear.
Shoulders back. Tummy in.

1216
01:44:55,125 --> 01:44:58,583
Agnes, tonight you are queen of Romania.

1217
01:45:07,471 --> 01:45:12,708
Agnes. On your feet.
Darling, you look divine.

1218
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:16,208
Do I really?
- Yes, now come along.

1219
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:20,378
Enchanting.

1220
01:45:22,018 --> 01:45:24,018
Golly.

1221
01:45:24,354 --> 01:45:27,414
Hang those furs on the Gooch. Hurry.

1222
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:36,066
Auntie Mame, Gloria Upson.
This is my Auntie Mame, Mrs. Burnside.

1223
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:40,809
I can't tell you how pleased
I am to make your acquaintance.

1224
01:45:40,909 --> 01:45:44,275
Yes. Come in, children.
Do, please.

1225
01:45:45,142 --> 01:45:47,911
There's some friends I'd like you to meet.

1226
01:45:48,011 --> 01:45:52,187
This is my secretary, Miss Gooch.
My Boswell, as it were.

1227
01:45:52,287 --> 01:45:56,651
Miss Upson and my nephew, Patrick.
What is your boyfriend's name?

1228
01:45:56,751 --> 01:45:59,221
O'Bannion. Mr. O'Bannion.

1229
01:45:59,389 --> 01:46:03,126
Well, now, you two run along
and have a good time.

1230
01:46:03,226 --> 01:46:06,530
Well, good night.

1231
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:12,335
I can't tell you how pleased I am
to have met you, Mr. O'Bannion.

1232
01:46:12,435 --> 01:46:14,435
And Miss Boswell.

1233
01:46:15,945 --> 01:46:19,681
Well, Patrick tells me
how special you are to him.

1234
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:23,541
That means you're very special to me too.

1235
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:27,820
My, what a stunning apartment.
- Thank you.

1236
01:46:27,917 --> 01:46:31,191
Books are awfully decorative,
don't you think?

1237
01:46:31,291 --> 01:46:33,317
Won't you sit down?

1238
01:46:33,495 --> 01:46:37,692
Can I get you something? A cognac?
- Another hot chocolate?

1239
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:42,938
Not a thing. On our way to Bunny's,
my friend who lives on Park Avenue...

1240
01:46:43,038 --> 01:46:46,870
...Patrick and I just stuffed
ourselves at Schrafft's.

1241
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:49,873
Do you know what your silly nephew did?

1242
01:46:49,973 --> 01:46:53,000
He spoke French to the counterman.

1243
01:46:53,176 --> 01:46:58,708
Imagine anybody speaking French
to a counterman at Schrafft's.

1244
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:01,286
Show-off.

1245
01:47:05,493 --> 01:47:09,549
If nobody minds,
I think I'll have something.

1246
01:47:09,998 --> 01:47:13,196
You're at school, dear?

1247
01:47:13,903 --> 01:47:16,733
I'm an Upper Richmond Girls' School girl.

1248
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:20,337
How did you get that lovely tan
so early in spring?

1249
01:47:20,437 --> 01:47:23,039
I played hooky for a couple of weeks.

1250
01:47:23,139 --> 01:47:28,016
Mums and Daddums and I went
to our place in Fort Lauderdale.

1251
01:47:28,116 --> 01:47:31,414
I was out of my mind until she got back.

1252
01:47:31,514 --> 01:47:35,752
I'm insanely jealous of this kid.
It's torture and I love it.

1253
01:47:35,852 --> 01:47:37,852
Silly.

1254
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:47,490
Tell me, dear, have you
chosen your major yet?

1255
01:47:49,071 --> 01:47:51,431
Chosen my major?

1256
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:54,775
What courses are you taking at college?

1257
01:47:54,875 --> 01:48:00,043
Just a general sort of liberal arts
thing. English Lit and like that.

1258
01:48:00,143 --> 01:48:04,949
Upper Richmond's top drawer.
Really top drawer.

1259
01:48:07,622 --> 01:48:10,682
How did you two ever get acquainted?

1260
01:48:10,854 --> 01:48:13,220
Uncle Dwight introduced us.

1261
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:16,085
Uncle Dwight? Oh, yes.

1262
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,434
Well, he's not really my uncle.

1263
01:48:19,534 --> 01:48:23,772
But he's been a close friend
of the family since I was a girl...

1264
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:26,500
...with braces on my teeth.

1265
01:48:27,409 --> 01:48:30,073
One day I must meet Mums and Daddums.

1266
01:48:30,173 --> 01:48:32,775
We won't bother you with family stuff.

1267
01:48:32,875 --> 01:48:36,578
Naturally, we'll expect you at the wedding.

1268
01:48:37,712 --> 01:48:39,914
The wedding?

1269
01:48:40,488 --> 01:48:42,224
Is there a wedding?

1270
01:48:42,324 --> 01:48:46,187
I toad you it was definite,
Auntie Mame.

1271
01:48:47,458 --> 01:48:51,283
Well, it's awfully good of you
to let me know.

1272
01:48:52,033 --> 01:48:56,233
We've decided on a September wedding
at our place in Montebank.

1273
01:48:56,333 --> 01:49:01,400
September?
Tell me, just where is Montebank?

1274
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:04,074
It's above Darien. You'll love it.

1275
01:49:04,174 --> 01:49:07,577
It's awfully pretty
and terribly handy to the city.

1276
01:49:07,677 --> 01:49:10,907
Of course, it's completely restricted.

1277
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,583
I'll get a blood test.

1278
01:49:14,684 --> 01:49:18,059
We'd better hurry
to catch that Italian picture.

1279
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:23,344
Those awful foreign movies.
What I go through for your nephew.

1280
01:49:23,498 --> 01:49:25,934
But he is kind of cute, isn't he?

1281
01:49:26,034 --> 01:49:28,034
Yes, isn't he?

1282
01:49:28,598 --> 01:49:31,473
I'm pleased to have made
your acquaintance.

1283
01:49:31,573 --> 01:49:33,573
Thank you, dear.

1284
01:49:35,672 --> 01:49:37,797
Well? Isn't she terrific?

1285
01:49:38,375 --> 01:49:40,375
Yes, dear. Yes, she is.

1286
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:46,042
So are you, Auntie Mame.
You're really top drawer. I mean...

1287
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:49,171
...well, you know what I mean.

1288
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:59,699
Now, why did I ever buy him
those long pants?

1289
01:50:09,244 --> 01:50:14,015
Hang on to the red dye pot. I may
want it after visiting the Upsons.

1290
01:50:14,115 --> 01:50:17,345
It's just what you wanted.
Respectable.

1291
01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:20,055
If a bit drab.
Did you bring the car?

1292
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:24,287
I go to garage. No Duesenberg.
Mr. O'Bannion no bring back.

1293
01:50:24,387 --> 01:50:27,123
I hope nothing has happened...
To Agnes.

1294
01:50:27,223 --> 01:50:33,343
I'll call Mr. Lindsay and borrow one.
Don't forget the maps and martinis.

1295
01:50:36,538 --> 01:50:39,200
What happened, Missy Gooch?

1296
01:50:39,835 --> 01:50:41,403
I lived.

1297
01:50:41,503 --> 01:50:43,346
What kind party was that?

1298
01:50:43,446 --> 01:50:48,906
I don't remember. All that champagne,
I don't remember a thing.

1299
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:53,416
I think we went to a movie.
Yeah, there was a wedding in it.

1300
01:50:53,516 --> 01:50:56,210
And Gary cooper was the groom.

1301
01:50:56,386 --> 01:51:00,228
I don't remember who the girl was,
but it made me cry.

1302
01:51:00,328 --> 01:51:01,991
Where's Mrs. Burnside?

1303
01:51:02,091 --> 01:51:05,233
She get ready for Connecticut.
Where Duesenberg?

1304
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:09,999
I don't know. Mr. O'Bannion said
he just had to meet my mother.

1305
01:51:10,099 --> 01:51:15,166
Then we got on the Staten island Ferry
and he disappeared.

1306
01:51:15,337 --> 01:51:18,375
I've got to see Mrs. Burnside
before she goes.

1307
01:51:18,475 --> 01:51:20,275
Is anything wrong?

1308
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:24,437
I did just what she toad me. I lived.

1309
01:51:24,619 --> 01:51:28,345
I've gotta find out what to do now.

1310
01:51:46,501 --> 01:51:50,608
I think it's a very good match
for our little  Gloria.

1311
01:51:50,708 --> 01:51:54,015
Why didn't Dwight want us
to meet the aunt?

1312
01:51:54,115 --> 01:51:56,851
We never would have if she hadn't phoned.

1313
01:51:56,951 --> 01:52:01,117
I'm goad she did.
I've been dying to get a look at her.

1314
01:52:01,217 --> 01:52:04,987
Where is she now?
- Freshening up in the guest room.

1315
01:52:05,087 --> 01:52:09,159
That certainly is an expensive outfit
she's wearing.

1316
01:52:09,259 --> 01:52:12,495
I looked at the label in her coat.

1317
01:52:13,096 --> 01:52:16,471
I'll bet she's better fixed
than Dwight figured.

1318
01:52:16,571 --> 01:52:20,503
I hope it's all right to have
a cocktail hour in the patio.

1319
01:52:20,603 --> 01:52:23,373
She may think we live like gypsies.

1320
01:52:23,473 --> 01:52:27,208
You show me a gypsy that lives like we do.

1321
01:52:28,376 --> 01:52:33,616
Claude, you be genteel
in front of Mrs. Burnside.

1322
01:52:36,019 --> 01:52:38,019
That must be she.

1323
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:41,695
We're out here on the patio,
Mrs. Burnside.

1324
01:52:43,792 --> 01:52:46,694
What a delightful spot you have here.

1325
01:52:46,794 --> 01:52:48,889
We adore Montebank.

1326
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:53,067
Of course, we airways spend summers
at our camp in the Adirondacks.

1327
01:52:53,167 --> 01:52:56,935
We call it Upson Pines.
We leave next week.

1328
01:52:57,112 --> 01:53:00,682
There's one thing we ought
to get straight right off.

1329
01:53:00,782 --> 01:53:04,375
You do take a little  nip,
now and then?

1330
01:53:05,583 --> 01:53:08,078
On festive occasions.

1331
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:09,919
Good.

1332
01:53:10,019 --> 01:53:13,262
I'll have an Upson daiquiri
ready in a minute.

1333
01:53:13,362 --> 01:53:18,399
I can't get over the thought you've
given every detail of your house.

1334
01:53:18,499 --> 01:53:23,733
We've done all we could  to make it
seem like authentic colonial America.

1335
01:53:23,833 --> 01:53:27,428
And how well you've succeeded.

1336
01:53:27,604 --> 01:53:32,146
Those enchanting miniatures in the
powder room of John Quincy Adams.

1337
01:53:32,246 --> 01:53:35,483
Did you see our driveway signpost?
- I did.

1338
01:53:35,583 --> 01:53:40,258
What a divine name you've
given this place, Upson Downs.

1339
01:53:40,383 --> 01:53:43,586
I'll bet you thought of that.
- That was Claude.

1340
01:53:43,686 --> 01:53:47,787
I'm just a homebody.
Claude is the clever one.

1341
01:53:50,292 --> 01:53:53,057
Now, Mrs. Upson...
- Doris, dear.

1342
01:53:53,229 --> 01:53:56,829
Doris, dear.
Well, you must call me Mame.

1343
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,093
Mamie.

1344
01:53:59,302 --> 01:54:00,608
Mame.

1345
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:04,200
Well, Mamie ode girl,
here's your poison.

1346
01:54:04,375 --> 01:54:09,350
I use a secret ingredient I learned
from a native in Havana, Cuba.

1347
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:13,615
You'll never guess what
that secret ingredient is.

1348
01:54:13,683 --> 01:54:19,038
I'll say this much, there's no sugar
in a Claude Upson daiquiri.

1349
01:54:20,161 --> 01:54:23,995
And yet it's so sweet.

1350
01:54:24,927 --> 01:54:27,696
Whatever do you use?

1351
01:54:27,869 --> 01:54:30,389
Chocolate ice cream?

1352
01:54:33,436 --> 01:54:35,666
Say, that's rich.

1353
01:54:35,837 --> 01:54:39,662
Did you hear that, Doris?
Chocolate ice cream.

1354
01:54:43,179 --> 01:54:48,056
Since you're practically one of the
family, I'll let you in on my secret.

1355
01:54:48,156 --> 01:54:50,156
Honey.

1356
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,487
I beg pardon?

1357
01:54:52,587 --> 01:54:55,477
Strained honey. That's the secret.

1358
01:54:56,592 --> 01:55:00,960
Of course, I use quite a little  rum too.

1359
01:55:06,602 --> 01:55:10,846
Now, Mamie, I've made these
especially for you, dear.

1360
01:55:10,946 --> 01:55:14,432
Oh, my. Don't they look delicious?

1361
01:55:14,615 --> 01:55:17,875
Well, well, well.

1362
01:55:20,822 --> 01:55:23,376
What are they?

1363
01:55:23,553 --> 01:55:27,457
I put two cans of tuna fish
through the meat grinder...

1364
01:55:27,557 --> 01:55:30,525
...then add clam juice and peanut butter.

1365
01:55:30,625 --> 01:55:33,267
It's a recipe from Ladies' Home Journal.

1366
01:55:33,367 --> 01:55:35,999
These are plain Jack cheese and chutney.

1367
01:55:36,099 --> 01:55:40,608
Now, sit you down, Mamie.
I've something special to show you.

1368
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:43,228
Baby pictures of Gloria?

1369
01:55:43,411 --> 01:55:46,073
The whole family, more or less.

1370
01:55:46,247 --> 01:55:49,678
On a bear rug. Isn't that precious?

1371
01:55:49,846 --> 01:55:53,304
Better not let Patrick see that one.

1372
01:55:59,555 --> 01:56:04,026
That's Miss Tuttall,
Little Glorys first school teacher.

1373
01:56:04,126 --> 01:56:06,934
I think the light was hurting her eyes.

1374
01:56:07,034 --> 01:56:09,638
Enough of this girly-girly talk.

1375
01:56:09,738 --> 01:56:13,808
Since we have Mamie here,
we ought to let her know the plans.

1376
01:56:13,908 --> 01:56:15,941
Plans?
- For Patrick's career.

1377
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:18,608
Dwight Babcock and I
have that coordinated.

1378
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:21,744
After the honeymoon,
I want Patrick to choose.

1379
01:56:21,844 --> 01:56:27,388
I can slip him into a berth on Madison
Avenue or a seat on the stock exchange.

1380
01:56:27,488 --> 01:56:31,313
A seat and a berth...
Pardon me. I'm so sorry.

1381
01:56:31,325 --> 01:56:36,898
Mamie, you're a pretty fast drinker.
Don't worry, I'm way ahead of you.

1382
01:56:36,998 --> 01:56:40,663
You don't happen to like gin, do you?
- I adore it.

1383
01:56:40,763 --> 01:56:43,900
After dinner,
we'll get out the cards and play.

1384
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,072
Now we come to the problem of the
wedding present. I have that settled.

1385
01:56:49,172 --> 01:56:51,275
Now, here's my idea, Mamie:

1386
01:56:51,375 --> 01:56:55,776
Why don't you and I get together
and buy the newlyweds that?

1387
01:56:55,876 --> 01:56:58,681
What?
- That lot, right next door.

1388
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:01,250
Wouldn't that make a wedding present?

1389
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:04,892
We could  take out this wall
and join our patios.

1390
01:57:04,992 --> 01:57:07,691
You couldnt tell where one left off.

1391
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:12,806
You wouldn't be losing a daughter.
You'd be gaining a patio.

1392
01:57:13,367 --> 01:57:17,533
We gotta work fast. There's
people bidding on that property.

1393
01:57:17,633 --> 01:57:19,502
The wrong kind.

1394
01:57:19,602 --> 01:57:22,441
A fellow named Epstein.
Abraham Epstein.

1395
01:57:22,541 --> 01:57:26,909
The cellist? How icky you are.
All that glorious music next door.

1396
01:57:27,009 --> 01:57:29,009
And she's a darling.

1397
01:57:29,044 --> 01:57:32,721
I guess you don't understand
quite how it is here.

1398
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:36,619
This section is restricted
only up to our property line.

1399
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:39,928
We feel we have an obligation
to make sure...

1400
01:57:40,028 --> 01:57:42,547
...well, you know.

1401
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:47,733
I'll tell you what. I'll buy it
and we'll divvy it up 5o-5o.

1402
01:57:47,833 --> 01:57:51,266
You won't have to worry about a thing.

1403
01:57:55,972 --> 01:57:58,270
My, my, my.

1404
01:57:58,746 --> 01:58:01,516
You've thought of everything,
haven't you?

1405
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:04,011
Laid out Patrick's career.

1406
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:06,478
Planned the wedding.

1407
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:10,844
Even chosen my gift.

1408
01:58:12,922 --> 01:58:17,025
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left for me to do.

1409
01:58:17,125 --> 01:58:18,566
What's that?

1410
01:58:18,666 --> 01:58:24,000
When you get back from Prickly Pines,
I'll give an intimate family dinner.

1411
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,904
Well, how about that?

1412
01:58:27,074 --> 01:58:30,095
Say, you're a good scout, Mamie.

1413
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:33,612
By golly, you're top drawer.

1414
01:58:45,291 --> 01:58:48,776
Well, that's a very interesting design...

1415
01:58:48,891 --> 01:58:53,226
...but are you sure you planned it
with that end up?

1416
01:58:55,598 --> 01:59:00,666
That is the beauty of it, madam.
It can be used upside down.

1417
01:59:21,257 --> 01:59:24,197
Just leave it outside, please.

1418
01:59:25,533 --> 01:59:28,664
I'm so sorry.
You must be Patrick Dennis.

1419
01:59:28,764 --> 01:59:31,534
Guilty. Are you guilty of all of this?

1420
01:59:31,634 --> 01:59:35,737
I'm not the decorator. I'm your
aunt's secretary, Pegeen Ryan.

1421
01:59:35,837 --> 01:59:38,466
How do you do?
- Hello.

1422
01:59:39,914 --> 01:59:43,212
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I was away all summer.

1423
01:59:43,312 --> 01:59:46,520
A lot of changes here.
Leave it to Auntie Mame.

1424
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:50,786
Where'd she get this stuff?
- It's the only set in the universe.

1425
01:59:50,886 --> 01:59:55,051
It's made by the famous
Danish designer, Yui Uhiu.

1426
01:59:55,196 --> 01:59:57,064
Who?

1427
01:59:57,164 --> 02:00:00,327
Yui Uhiu.

1428
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:04,665
Say that to the right fella
and you'll get kissed.

1429
02:00:05,601 --> 02:00:09,810
Incidentally, congratulations.
I hear you're getting married.

1430
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:13,180
A week from next Tuesday.
The ode ball and chain.

1431
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:17,384
I wish I had said that. Or,
'The first 100 years are the hardest.'

1432
02:00:17,484 --> 02:00:21,284
Good one. How about,
'Marriage is a great institution'?

1433
02:00:21,384 --> 02:00:25,291
'Yeah, but who wants
to be in an institution?'

1434
02:00:27,223 --> 02:00:29,917
Well, that's enough of that.

1435
02:00:30,092 --> 02:00:34,256
Patrick. Patrick, my little  love.

1436
02:00:36,037 --> 02:00:40,169
I'm goad to see you. Did you have
a good time at Upson Pines?

1437
02:00:40,269 --> 02:00:43,441
I had a wonderful time.
What is the idea of...?

1438
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:48,044
Not now. I have to go to Montebank.
- They adored you but...

1439
02:00:48,144 --> 02:00:52,721
...I'm so relieved. I want everything
to be extra special tonight...

1440
02:00:52,821 --> 02:00:56,252
...and give the Upsons
as cozy a time as they gave me.

1441
02:00:56,352 --> 02:00:58,987
Now, Pegeen, dear...
- I forgot the horror.

1442
02:00:59,087 --> 02:01:02,325
Will someone help me with the ladder?
- Of course.

1443
02:01:02,425 --> 02:01:07,333
Fish food. Where's the fish food?
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

1444
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:11,472
Don't nibble on the hors d'oeuvres.
You'll get fat.

1445
02:01:11,572 --> 02:01:16,908
I'm sorry, Mrs. Burnside.
I try to do exactly as you say.

1446
02:01:17,078 --> 02:01:20,912
Come and get it.
Come along, come along.

1447
02:01:21,115 --> 02:01:23,167
You're so wonderful.

1448
02:01:23,345 --> 02:01:27,249
Nobody else would've taken me in,
an outcast of society.

1449
02:01:27,349 --> 02:01:32,455
I'm grateful. You've given me a new
interest, now that I'm losing Patrick.

1450
02:01:32,555 --> 02:01:36,792
I wish I had someone to look after.
- You will, dear, you will.

1451
02:01:36,892 --> 02:01:41,737
Where do you want this set up?
- Right there will be fine.

1452
02:01:42,264 --> 02:01:45,606
What's that supposed to be?
- You don't like it?

1453
02:01:45,706 --> 02:01:49,237
It might be a little  avant-garde
for the Upsons.

1454
02:01:49,337 --> 02:01:53,209
Take it right down.
I want everything to be perfect.

1455
02:01:53,309 --> 02:01:58,239
I think it's very unusual.
- Agnes. What is she doing here?

1456
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:03,085
Where else, in her condition?
- The Upsons will not understand.

1457
02:02:03,185 --> 02:02:06,670
Perhaps they won't notice.
- Won't notice?

1458
02:02:06,695 --> 02:02:08,791
They're here. They're here.

1459
02:02:08,891 --> 02:02:11,860
Help me get this down.
- Help her, darling.

1460
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:16,999
Leave it. Get the ladder out of here.
- Norah, Ito, somebody answer the door.

1461
02:02:17,099 --> 02:02:19,106
I'll get it.
- No, you don't.

1462
02:02:19,206 --> 02:02:24,434
He's right. Go and stay in your room.
- But what will I do?

1463
02:02:24,613 --> 02:02:30,875
Sleep, knit, start making up names:
Rudolph, Abigail, Beulah, anything.

1464
02:02:41,791 --> 02:02:45,458
Welcome to the Burnside fireside.

1465
02:02:45,626 --> 02:02:49,400
How I have looked forward
to this evening. Come in.

1466
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:54,372
And Claude.
- Good to see you, Mamie.

1467
02:02:54,541 --> 02:02:58,346
And little  Glory.
- I'm so pleased to see you again.

1468
02:02:58,446 --> 02:03:00,446
Yes, dear.

1469
02:03:01,343 --> 02:03:03,578
Say.

1470
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:06,778
My, my, my, my, my.

1471
02:03:06,954 --> 02:03:11,414
Hi, everybody.
- Well, hello, son.

1472
02:03:11,825 --> 02:03:13,987
Patrick.

1473
02:03:14,161 --> 02:03:18,621
Gloria.
- I made up a joke on the way up.

1474
02:03:18,792 --> 02:03:20,028
Listen to this:

1475
02:03:20,128 --> 02:03:25,590
Why is an elevator man's job
like my place in Connecticut?

1476
02:03:25,768 --> 02:03:28,965
Give up?
- Almost.

1477
02:03:29,138 --> 02:03:34,041
I'll tell you. Because it has
its ups and down.

1478
02:03:34,208 --> 02:03:36,644
You get it? Upson Downs.

1479
02:03:39,286 --> 02:03:43,950
Clever. Clever.
- Oh, well.

1480
02:03:44,124 --> 02:03:46,991
Do sit down.
- Thank you.

1481
02:03:48,757 --> 02:03:54,163
Doris, you're not comfortable.
These are all marvellously adjustable.

1482
02:03:54,263 --> 02:03:57,972
This is the master control.
Each chair has its cord.

1483
02:03:58,072 --> 02:04:03,172
Now, let me see, Doris.
You are number four. Now, here we go.

1484
02:04:06,041 --> 02:04:09,016
So sorry, Claude, you are number four.

1485
02:04:09,116 --> 02:04:11,751
Doris, you must be number five.

1486
02:04:11,785 --> 02:04:17,746
Patrick, you're confusing me.
Doris, here you are. Five, going up.

1487
02:04:17,919 --> 02:04:19,919
There we go.

1488
02:04:22,258 --> 02:04:24,932
Isn't it wonderful?
So easy to sweep under.

1489
02:04:25,032 --> 02:04:29,566
Claude, here we go. Hang on
to your seat belts. Down we go.

1490
02:04:29,666 --> 02:04:33,641
My, what supple legs you have.
You must have studied yoga.

1491
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:35,931
Here are the drinks.

1492
02:04:36,109 --> 02:04:38,833
So sorry, Doris dear.

1493
02:04:39,008 --> 02:04:45,208
Going down to the main floor.
Cigars, cigarettes, lingerie, hardware.

1494
02:04:49,351 --> 02:04:51,979
Well, now, Patrick.

1495
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:55,886
And little  Glory.

1496
02:04:56,725 --> 02:04:58,765
And here's Uncle Dwight.

1497
02:04:58,927 --> 02:05:02,260
Claude.
- Dwight.

1498
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:04,666
Well, how are you?

1499
02:05:04,833 --> 02:05:07,666
Mr. Babcock.
- Mrs. Burnside.

1500
02:05:07,835 --> 02:05:10,895
We must have that game of golf soon.

1501
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,608
My, my, my, my, my.

1502
02:05:13,708 --> 02:05:19,743
We'll have to take that up a bit.
Pegeen, better bring the ladder again.

1503
02:05:19,882 --> 02:05:23,190
Won't you sit down, Mr. Babcock?
- Thank you.

1504
02:05:23,290 --> 02:05:26,956
They're almost ready.
The spécialité de la maison.

1505
02:05:27,056 --> 02:05:30,898
I want you to meet Miss Pegeen Ryan.
- How do you do?

1506
02:05:30,998 --> 02:05:35,333
Take it up. It seems to be
getting in peoples' hair.

1507
02:05:37,204 --> 02:05:38,939
Claude.
- Thank you.

1508
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:41,333
And Doris.

1509
02:05:41,501 --> 02:05:46,441
Claude, I'm not going to tell you
one thing that's in these drinks...

1510
02:05:46,541 --> 02:05:51,246
...because all the ingredients are secret.

1511
02:05:51,416 --> 02:05:54,382
Now, now, now, just hang on.

1512
02:05:56,385 --> 02:05:59,450
Well, what do you know?

1513
02:05:59,625 --> 02:06:02,396
The trick is to drink them up fast...

1514
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:06,291
...before all the alcohol burns away.

1515
02:06:07,534 --> 02:06:13,335
Don't you worry about a thing, Claude.
I'm fully covered by fire insurance.

1516
02:06:13,435 --> 02:06:18,634
Well, now, Patrick. Here.
And little  Glory.

1517
02:06:18,807 --> 02:06:22,711
My friend who may drop in later
calls it the Flaming Mame.

1518
02:06:22,811 --> 02:06:26,411
Who? Who is coming?
- Just family, darling.

1519
02:06:29,156 --> 02:06:33,956
Don't be a scaredy-cat.
There's nothing to be frightened of.

1520
02:06:34,056 --> 02:06:36,217
There, now.

1521
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:38,657
Are we all lit?

1522
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:43,666
Mr. Upson, can I fix you a daiquiri?
- No. Not for a minute.

1523
02:06:43,766 --> 02:06:48,003
Your Aunt Mamie made this for me,
and I'm gonna drink it.

1524
02:06:48,103 --> 02:06:50,626
It looks just fine.

1525
02:06:54,915 --> 02:06:58,519
This is spicy.
Try one of the striped ones, Mums.

1526
02:06:58,619 --> 02:07:01,355
These are tasty.
- What are they, dear?

1527
02:07:01,455 --> 02:07:05,181
Just plain ode pickled rattlesnake.

1528
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:16,437
Pure protein. They're marinated
after they remove the fangs.

1529
02:07:16,537 --> 02:07:18,500
Mr. Babcock, you've gone out.

1530
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:21,933
Don't bother, Mrs. Burnside.

1531
02:07:25,674 --> 02:07:27,674
Agnes.

1532
02:07:27,915 --> 02:07:32,409
Agnes, I toad you to stay in your room.

1533
02:07:32,583 --> 02:07:36,085
But it's a quarter past 8,
and you toad me...

1534
02:07:36,185 --> 02:07:39,691
...I toad you to take your
pills a quarter past 8.

1535
02:07:39,791 --> 02:07:45,025
My calcium pills are in the kitchen.
- Now, now, come, dear.

1536
02:07:45,499 --> 02:07:49,233
Is that a member of the family?
- Darned if I know.

1537
02:07:49,333 --> 02:07:53,291
It's a member of somebody's family.

1538
02:07:57,172 --> 02:08:02,378
I would like you to meet my former
secretary. She's a little  bit...

1539
02:08:02,478 --> 02:08:05,185
She's not quite herself at the moment.

1540
02:08:05,285 --> 02:08:09,556
Now, we know all about these
women's things, don't we?

1541
02:08:09,656 --> 02:08:13,786
What's your name, dear?
- Gooch.

1542
02:08:14,423 --> 02:08:18,695
You sit right over here
beside me, Mrs. Gooch.

1543
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:41,250
And what does Mr. Gooch do?

1544
02:08:41,416 --> 02:08:45,118
Oh, my father passed on.

1545
02:08:45,354 --> 02:08:49,083
Oh, no. I mean your husband.

1546
02:08:50,592 --> 02:08:55,791
Now, now, Agnes. Upsy-daisy.
Calcium time, darling.

1547
02:08:56,070 --> 02:08:58,087
Pegeen, dear.

1548
02:08:58,267 --> 02:09:03,669
Auntie Mame is big-hearted
when anybody is in trouble.

1549
02:09:03,837 --> 02:09:05,904
I can see that.

1550
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:09,775
Vera and Lindsay.
- Mame, darling.

1551
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:13,180
Like an opening night without critics.

1552
02:09:13,348 --> 02:09:18,308
I'd like you to meet
my dearest friend, Vera Charles.

1553
02:09:18,492 --> 02:09:21,990
And the well-known publisher,
Mr. Lindsay Woolsey.

1554
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:25,548
I'm charmed to meet you,
all of you.

1555
02:09:25,727 --> 02:09:29,400
I've got to tell you,
I adored you in Mary of Scotland.

1556
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:33,559
Did you, dear? That was Helen Hayes.

1557
02:09:34,102 --> 02:09:36,102
Spirits.

1558
02:09:36,169 --> 02:09:39,480
Vera, can I persuade you to have a drink?

1559
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:42,708
Yes, dear. Anything but rum.

1560
02:09:42,876 --> 02:09:45,781
I've just been to the most awful party...

1561
02:09:45,881 --> 02:09:50,811
...where they served nothing
but daiquiris made with honey.

1562
02:09:51,958 --> 02:09:54,951
Mame.
- Acacius, darling.

1563
02:09:57,291 --> 02:09:59,385
Oh, Lord.

1564
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:02,134
Mr. And Mrs. Upson, Mr. Babcock...

1565
02:10:02,234 --> 02:10:07,169
...I'd like you to meet Acacius Page,
Patrick's first teacher in New York.

1566
02:10:07,269 --> 02:10:11,812
The man who had a great deal
to do with moulding his character.

1567
02:10:11,912 --> 02:10:14,540
Haven't we met before?

1568
02:10:14,708 --> 02:10:17,875
I don't recognize the face.

1569
02:10:24,553 --> 02:10:27,060
Acacius, darling, your lotus juice.

1570
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:29,287
Auntie Mame.
- Yes, dear.

1571
02:10:29,458 --> 02:10:33,962
I thought this was a family night.
- This is our family.

1572
02:10:34,062 --> 02:10:38,142
Pegeen, are you having trouble?
Help her, please.

1573
02:10:38,333 --> 02:10:40,597
Thank you.

1574
02:10:44,411 --> 02:10:47,275
Thanks, Lochinvar.
- Courtesy of the house.

1575
02:10:47,375 --> 02:10:51,483
I'm fine. You have enough problems.
- Don't I, though?

1576
02:10:51,583 --> 02:10:54,483
That's a pretty picture, I must say.

1577
02:10:54,583 --> 02:10:59,288
Yes, isn't it? Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to propose a toast.

1578
02:10:59,388 --> 02:11:01,596
To this lovely young couple...

1579
02:11:01,696 --> 02:11:05,888
...as they start up the ladder of life together.

1580
02:11:06,428 --> 02:11:10,958
Oh, no, Auntie Vera.
This isn't Gloria. That's Gloria.

1581
02:11:11,538 --> 02:11:13,538
Pity.

1582
02:11:16,471 --> 02:11:18,846
I brought you something.
- What is it?

1583
02:11:18,946 --> 02:11:22,404
Be careful. The ink's wet.
- My book.

1584
02:11:22,582 --> 02:11:25,316
I'm in print. Just like Edna Ferber.

1585
02:11:25,416 --> 02:11:28,150
You did it. I never knew you went on with it.

1586
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:31,651
Patrick, you have vision.
Mame, he's just like you.

1587
02:11:31,751 --> 02:11:35,791
My lifesaver, Patrick, and Lindsay.
- This has been a great day.

1588
02:11:35,891 --> 02:11:39,766
Patrick, why didn't you tell me
your aunt was literate?

1589
02:11:39,866 --> 02:11:44,626
Am I mentioned in your book?
- Mentioned? You're exposed.

1590
02:11:44,766 --> 02:11:49,101
A toast to Live, Live, Live
by Mame Dennis Burnside.

1591
02:11:49,335 --> 02:11:53,467
Step right up now,
and get your red hot chapters.

1592
02:11:53,642 --> 02:11:57,412
I've been to so many
wonderful parties here, Mame.

1593
02:11:57,512 --> 02:12:00,082
Now I'll see how they all ended.

1594
02:12:00,182 --> 02:12:05,987
I forgot about that time we almost got
caught in a speakeasy. I was 1o.

1595
02:12:06,087 --> 02:12:09,791
Here's all about the roller skates
and Uncle Beau.

1596
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:13,383
And that Christmas we were so broke.

1597
02:12:13,794 --> 02:12:17,458
Patrick, my little  Patrick.

1598
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,275
You can practically write a whole book
about what happened to me.

1599
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:25,108
I beg your pardon?

1600
02:12:25,208 --> 02:12:29,276
I said, you can write a whole book
about what happened to me.

1601
02:12:29,376 --> 02:12:30,983
Thank you.
- Yes.

1602
02:12:31,083 --> 02:12:35,751
Bunny Bixier and I were in the
semi-finals, the very semi-finals...

1603
02:12:35,851 --> 02:12:38,787
...of the Ping-Pong tournament at the club.

1604
02:12:38,887 --> 02:12:41,607
And this ghastly thing happened.

1605
02:12:41,723 --> 02:12:48,094
We were both playing way over
our heads and the score was 29-28.

1606
02:12:48,263 --> 02:12:50,566
We had this terrific volley...

1607
02:12:50,666 --> 02:12:55,404
...and I stepped back
to get this really terrific shot.

1608
02:12:55,575 --> 02:13:01,411
And I stepped on the Ping-Pong ball.

1609
02:13:02,249 --> 02:13:05,375
I just squashed it to bits.

1610
02:13:05,547 --> 02:13:10,190
And then Bunny and I ran to the closet
to get another ball.

1611
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:13,916
And the closet was locked. Imagine?

1612
02:13:14,087 --> 02:13:18,751
We had to call the whole thing off.

1613
02:13:19,699 --> 02:13:22,497
Well, it was ghastly.

1614
02:13:23,537 --> 02:13:27,093
Well, it was just ghastly.

1615
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:38,040
Well, it was amusing.
- Yes, yes.

1616
02:13:40,287 --> 02:13:43,083
It's hilarious.

1617
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:46,220
What is?
- Your story.

1618
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:54,894
I'm so proud. The whole
last chapter's all about me.

1619
02:13:55,128 --> 02:13:58,429
'Fighting the stigma...

1620
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:03,372
...of the unwed mother.'

1621
02:14:08,281 --> 02:14:10,316
Mr. Upson, you icky devil.

1622
02:14:10,416 --> 02:14:15,417
Your future son-in-law is featured in
one of the raciest books of the year.

1623
02:14:15,517 --> 02:14:20,393
Patrick, I had no idea how many times
you unzipped me and put me to bed.

1624
02:14:20,493 --> 02:14:23,492
Now, just a minute.
There are young people here.

1625
02:14:23,592 --> 02:14:28,291
I only did it when Miss Charles
had passed out.

1626
02:14:33,333 --> 02:14:34,567
Thank you, Ito.

1627
02:14:34,667 --> 02:14:38,577
Don't tell me she can't come.
- Who can't come?

1628
02:14:38,613 --> 02:14:42,816
That woman with the snakes from Paris.
She was to entertain us.

1629
02:14:42,916 --> 02:14:44,746
Vera, loan me your glasses.

1630
02:14:44,846 --> 02:14:47,749
'Read a forthcoming publication
of our book.

1631
02:14:47,849 --> 02:14:53,259
I'm entitled to half of the royalties
for services as editor and co-author...'

1632
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:55,191
Brian.

1633
02:14:55,291 --> 02:14:57,159
Brian?

1634
02:14:57,259 --> 02:15:02,274
'Will return in a few days
to claim fruits of collaboration.

1635
02:15:02,931 --> 02:15:07,567
My claim will be substantiated
by my wife, Agnes Gooch o'Bannion.'

1636
02:15:07,667 --> 02:15:08,941
Wife?

1637
02:15:09,041 --> 02:15:11,767
Think, Agnes, think.
- Think?

1638
02:15:11,946 --> 02:15:13,946
Try.

1639
02:15:16,283 --> 02:15:19,837
Maybe that wasn't a movie we went to.

1640
02:15:20,015 --> 02:15:24,712
Maybe that wasn't Gary cooper.
It was Brian.

1641
02:15:24,886 --> 02:15:27,416
And the girl was...

1642
02:15:28,828 --> 02:15:30,828
...me.

1643
02:15:30,864 --> 02:15:34,519
I'm a bride.
- Oh, darling, congratulations.

1644
02:15:34,596 --> 02:15:36,976
Isn't it wonderful, Patrick?

1645
02:15:37,071 --> 02:15:40,640
I'm so happy for you.
- Honey, isn't this terrific?

1646
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:44,345
This is revolting.
How can you tolerate people who...?

1647
02:15:44,445 --> 02:15:46,847
Who aren't absolutely top drawer?

1648
02:15:46,947 --> 02:15:49,816
These are my friends.
People who brought me up.

1649
02:15:49,916 --> 02:15:54,388
Riffraff. When we're married,
don't invite such people to our house.

1650
02:15:54,488 --> 02:15:59,592
Who'll be coming? Bunny, Muriel Puce?
- What's wrong with Muriel Puce?

1651
02:15:59,692 --> 02:16:04,264
She has the IQ of a dead battery.
As for your other girlfriends...

1652
02:16:04,364 --> 02:16:08,359
...they're a lot of vain,
selfish, empty bigots.

1653
02:16:11,132 --> 02:16:14,441
Marvellous. You'll make
a fortune out of this book.

1654
02:16:14,541 --> 02:16:16,675
She will, but not for herself.

1655
02:16:16,775 --> 02:16:20,242
She gave her royalties
to the Epstein Home in Montebank.

1656
02:16:20,342 --> 02:16:23,483
Epstein the cellist?
- What about Montebank?

1657
02:16:23,583 --> 02:16:27,109
Can't the Epsteins afford their own home?

1658
02:16:27,287 --> 02:16:29,784
They're not going to live there.

1659
02:16:29,884 --> 02:16:34,729
They're building a home there
for refugee Jewish children.

1660
02:16:34,829 --> 02:16:37,883
What's that?.
- Oh, no.

1661
02:16:39,928 --> 02:16:41,928
Jackpot.

1662
02:16:45,539 --> 02:16:49,970
Pegeen, call Denmark quick
and get a hold of Yui Uhiu.

1663
02:16:56,311 --> 02:16:58,436
Are you all right, Doris?

1664
02:16:59,154 --> 02:17:00,318
You ready?

1665
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:04,681
I've been ready for quite some time.
Come, Glory.

1666
02:17:04,853 --> 02:17:06,853
You....

1667
02:17:08,291 --> 02:17:13,419
Claude. Claude. Don't be hasty.

1668
02:17:22,437 --> 02:17:27,542
For 9 years, Mame Dennis Burnside,
I have done everything in my power...

1669
02:17:27,642 --> 02:17:32,019
...to protect this boy from
your idiotic, cockeyed nincompoopery.

1670
02:17:32,119 --> 02:17:35,953
Now you've ruined everything.
All my plans for Patrick....

1671
02:17:36,051 --> 02:17:42,183
Your plans.
You're shouting orders for everyone.

1672
02:17:42,364 --> 02:17:45,766
Did it occur to you
this boy might be hungry...

1673
02:17:45,866 --> 02:17:48,971
...for something you've never heard of?

1674
02:17:49,071 --> 02:17:52,202
When Patrick first walked into my life...

1675
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:55,000
...a frightened little  boy...

1676
02:17:55,169 --> 02:17:58,501
...hanging on to Norah's hand...

1677
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:03,041
...it was love at first sight.

1678
02:18:03,583 --> 02:18:06,950
For 9 years I've tried
to open windows in his life.

1679
02:18:07,048 --> 02:18:09,953
You want to shut him up
in a safe deposit box.

1680
02:18:10,051 --> 02:18:13,538
I won't let you do that to my little  one.

1681
02:18:14,756 --> 02:18:16,756
Oh, no.

1682
02:18:18,393 --> 02:18:21,226
He's not little  anymore.

1683
02:18:23,204 --> 02:18:27,037
And he's not mine.
But he's not yours, Mr. Babcock.

1684
02:18:27,135 --> 02:18:31,812
Patrick won't let you settle him down
in a restricted community...

1685
02:18:31,912 --> 02:18:34,209
...make him an Aryan from Darien...

1686
02:18:34,309 --> 02:18:39,070
...and marry him off to a girl
with braces on her brains.

1687
02:18:48,723 --> 02:18:53,217
Mame, did you deliberately plan all this?

1688
02:18:54,429 --> 02:18:59,924
Don't be ridiculous. Patrick airways
makes all his own decisions.

1689
02:19:00,101 --> 02:19:02,968
Rattlesnake, anyone?

1690
02:19:08,977 --> 02:19:11,208
Thank you...

1691
02:19:12,083 --> 02:19:14,876
...Lady iris.

1692
02:19:16,083 --> 02:19:18,177
Charmed...

1693
02:19:19,387 --> 02:19:22,049
...Lord Dudley.

1694
02:19:29,666 --> 02:19:33,395
Punjab, India. June 28, 1946.

1695
02:19:33,574 --> 02:19:37,645
Mr. And Mrs. Patrick Dennis,
224 E. 50th Street, New York.

1696
02:19:37,745 --> 02:19:41,543
Dear Patrick and Pegeen:
Arriving from India, June 31.

1697
02:19:41,643 --> 02:19:43,851
Meet me Beekman Place apartment.

1698
02:19:43,951 --> 02:19:46,318
Must return India in two Weeks...

1699
02:19:46,416 --> 02:19:51,431
...When Uncle Lindsay Will have
finished his course in yoga.

1700
02:20:27,587 --> 02:20:32,433
What were you doing in there?
- Just giving Michael his presents.

1701
02:20:32,533 --> 02:20:35,083
Look, Dad. Which is the front?

1702
02:20:35,096 --> 02:20:39,556
Oh, my little  love, let me help you.
There, now.

1703
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:44,416
Salaam for your mother
like Auntie Mame just taught you.

1704
02:20:44,745 --> 02:20:47,708
Very good, sahib.

1705
02:20:47,875 --> 02:20:52,284
That's not a real sword, is it?
- It's a scimitar.

1706
02:20:54,322 --> 02:20:56,448
That's what I airways say.

1707
02:20:56,583 --> 02:21:00,929
In Hindustani it means, 'The
water oxen are waiting at the gate.'

1708
02:21:01,029 --> 02:21:07,222
My water oxen's waiting at Idyllwild,
Pan American flight 100 for Karachi.

1709
02:21:07,395 --> 02:21:11,263
Michael, if I could  only show you India.

1710
02:21:11,432 --> 02:21:14,169
The colour, the splendour, the mystery.

1711
02:21:14,269 --> 02:21:18,906
The elephants in the street...
- Now, Auntie Mame.

1712
02:21:20,675 --> 02:21:22,484
I know, I know.

1713
02:21:22,583 --> 02:21:27,784
I shouldnt mention the possibility
of Michael going to India with me.

1714
02:21:27,882 --> 02:21:31,559
Auntie Mame said she'd love
to have me. She said so in there.

1715
02:21:31,659 --> 02:21:35,493
That's ridiculous. I won't hear of it.
- Dad?

1716
02:21:35,663 --> 02:21:39,659
It's out of the question.
You heard your mother.

1717
02:21:43,405 --> 02:21:47,308
You know what your trouble is?
You don't live, live, live.

1718
02:21:47,408 --> 02:21:52,592
Life is a banquet and most poor
suckers are starving to death.

1719
02:22:07,055 --> 02:22:09,159
One thing you must remember:

1720
02:22:09,257 --> 02:22:13,568
School begins the day after Labor Day.
He must be back by then.

1721
02:22:13,666 --> 02:22:16,458
Naturally.

1722
02:22:17,166 --> 02:22:19,462
Of course.

1723
02:22:19,707 --> 02:22:25,166
Labor Day. That's sometime
in November, isn't it?

1724
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:28,245
The first week in September,
Auntie Mame.

1725
02:22:28,343 --> 02:22:32,385
Labor. The problem of labour
in India is gargantuan.

1726
02:22:32,485 --> 02:22:34,722
What's 'gargantuan,' Auntie Mame?

1727
02:22:34,822 --> 02:22:37,725
On the plane, I'll give you
a pad and pencil...

1728
02:22:37,825 --> 02:22:41,061
...to write down all the words
you don't understand.

1729
02:22:41,161 --> 02:22:45,027
I've been out shopping all morning
for your travelling gear.

1730
02:22:45,125 --> 02:22:48,424
Let's go upstairs and try things on.

1731
02:22:48,596 --> 02:22:53,226
Oh, Michael, I'm going
to open doors for you.

1732
02:22:53,407 --> 02:22:56,740
Doors you never even dreamed existed.

1733
02:22:57,169 --> 02:23:00,113
I give up. She's the pied piper.

1734
02:23:00,281 --> 02:23:03,044
Oh, what times we're going to have.

1735
02:23:03,144 --> 02:23:06,583
What vistas we're going
to explore together.

1736
02:23:06,681 --> 02:23:09,859
We'll spend a day at
an ancient Hindu temple.

1737
02:23:09,958 --> 02:23:12,527
The head monk is Auntie Mame's friend.

1738
02:23:12,625 --> 02:23:16,958
Perhaps he'll let you ring the bells
that bring the monks to prayer.

1739
02:23:17,058 --> 02:23:21,696
There, on the highest tower on a
clear day, you can see the Taj Mahal.

1740
02:23:21,794 --> 02:23:24,259
Beyond that is a beautiful...
