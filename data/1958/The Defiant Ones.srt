Sewin' machine

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,292
Sew so fast

12
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:40,265
Sew eleven stitches

13
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:44,006
In a little cat's tail

14
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:49,281
I left my home in Nashville

15
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:52,830
A-look a-here what I got, Jack

16
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:56,666
A-twenty long years on a chain gang

17
00:00:57,913 --> 00:01:00,023
A-sweatin' and bustin' rock

18
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:04,051
A judge, he come from Memphis

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,600
A-put me in the pen

20
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:11,820
If I ever see his face once more

21
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,985
He never get home again

22
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,479

00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,795

A long gone

27
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:26,878
What I mean

28
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,660
A long gone judge on a bowlin' green

29
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:32,249
Bowlin' green

30
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,894

00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,251

00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,020
We oughta make him ride up front.
See how much singin' he'll do then.

00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,528

Shut up!

40
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:05,818
Long gone

41
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:10,518
To Kentucky

42
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,410
Long gone

43
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,438
You heard what the man
said, nigger. Now shut up!

44
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:26,056
You call me nigger again, Joker,
and I'm gonna kill ya!

45
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:28,166
Make your move, ni...

46
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,235
Look out!

47
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,295
(siren)

48
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,436
(police radio)

49
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,834
(siren)

50
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:31,468
Sheriff Muller speakin'.

51
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:34,537
No, Governor. Nobody dead.

52
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,510
Yes. Sideswiped.

53
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,812
Yes. Only two escaped.

54
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,457
Yes, Governor, I know
what my first obligation is.

55
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,238
We're still waitin' on the dogs.

56
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:49,211
Yes, Governor. Any minute now.

57
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,993
I got a call in to Warden Comisky.

58
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,693
Yes, Governor. I'm quite sure you will.

59
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,270
Hello, Max.

60
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:07,051
- Am I the first?
- You're the only one I called.

61
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,161
- Anythin' new?
- Not a thing.

62
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:13,093
Drivers are still unconscious. The men
don't know anythin', or won't say.

63
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,395
- Who was on the phone?
- The governor.

64
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:18,081
- Oh? Anythin' I can print?
- Sure.

65
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:21,438
He says he's gonna get
to the bottom of this.

66
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,507
- That's nice of him.
- It's an election year.

67
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,001
It's election year for you, too, Max.

68
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,947
Try Warden Comisky again.
We need that laundry for the dogs.

69
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:37,743
And call Marysville.
See if they located that dog man.

70
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,236
Here you are, Sheriff. Coffee.

71
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:41,867
Thanks.

72
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,512
( rock'n'roll)

73
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,005
Let's go, boys, let's go. Pile it out.

74
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:52,130
That's right, pile it out, will you, boys?
We have no time to lose.

75
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:55,103
Now what the devil...?

76
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,035
Here we are, Max.

77
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:01,145
- Who sent for you?
- I called 'em.

78
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:03,543
- What am I gonna do with 'em?
- Deputise 'em.

79
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:06,612
We can't work short-handed.
I only have six men.

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,490
Will you turn that radio off, please?

81
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,791
If the roadblocks don't pick them up,

82
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:15,628
we may have to fine-comb a lot
of ground before we flush 'em.

83
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,177
Well, watch how you play with
those guns. They're not toys.

84
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:24,931
Are you kiddin', Max, after all the huntin'
we've done? It's just like runnin' rabbits.

85
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,809
- These are men.
- Same thing.

86
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,919
Sure.

87
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:32,508
Men and rabbits... same thing.

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,002
It's not the same thing!

89
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:39,318
Well, we just want to give you
a hand, Max. Help out.

90
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,867
- You wanna be helpful, Lou?
- Sure, Max.

91
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,169
Good. Get rid of this.

92
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:50,636
All right, boys. Chow down the line.
Let's eat it up. Off we go.

93
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:57,637
Quit bein' stubborn. They really want
to help, and they can come in handy.

94
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,227
- I guess so.
- All right.

95
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,008
What about the two men who escaped?

96
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,790
- Sheriff, I got the warden on the phone.
- Fine.

97
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:10,585
Get the captain to show you the records.
Get everythin' you want from them.

98
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,683
(police radio)

99
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,631
Noah Cullen. Negro.

100
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,892
Assault and battery. Intent to kill. 10 to 20.

101
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:37,153
Parole refused. Solitary. Work camp.

102
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:40,414
John Jackson. Caucasian.
Armed robbery...

103
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:43,099
- Caucasian?
- Caucasian.

104
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:47,703
Five to 10. Attacked guard.
Additional five. Parole refused.

105
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,923
Hey, Max. How come they chained
a white man to a black?

106
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,609
The warden's got a sense of humour.

107
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:57,774
What'd he say just now?

108
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:01,131
He said not to worry about catching 'em.

109
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,392
They'll probably kill each other
before they go five miles.

110
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,955
(birds chirping)

111
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,165
( rock'n'roll)

112
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,321
(dogs barking)

113
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,213
Hey! Max! Stop aggravatin' those dogs!

114
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,898
What's he so excited about?

115
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:06,255
You shouldn't be eatin' in front
of the dogs! That isn't very nice!

116
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,557
They've got feelings too, you know.

117
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,091
Shut up in there! Shut up!

118
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,777
Solly, we're not hurtin' their feelings.

119
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:17,093
I'm sorry, Sheriff, I shouldn't have yelled.
But my dogs are high-strung.

120
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:19,203
Now will you please...

121
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,217
What are those?

122
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:24,095
These beauties in here?
These are Dobermans.

123
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:27,068
- You don't know nothin' about dogs.
- Not that kind.

124
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:30,904
Well now, my bloodhounds here
won't even touch a hamburger.

125
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,973
But these beauties... when my
bloodhounds track 'em down,

126
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:38,002
- these'll take care of them, all right.
- We ain't gonna need 'em.

127
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:41,455
We're dealin' with a couple of
dangerous criminals, Sheriff.

128
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:45,291
How dangerous can they be,
chained together?

129
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,401
Look, Muller, come here.

130
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,799
You're new to this kind of operation.

131
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:54,211
If your views are humanitarian, you think
about the farmers and your own deputies.

132
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,321
Let me do my own thinkin', Captain.

133
00:08:56,513 --> 00:09:01,596
It's your show, Sheriff, but I say the dogs
go along. I've got my own men to think of.

134
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,145
All right, but kept on a leash.

135
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:10,900
Solly? You keep those dogs on a leash.
Don't let 'em go unless I tell ya.

136
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:17,230
Solly, you'll find the old clothes
in the back of the squad car.

137
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:22,025
I'll have to make a big circle. Your men
been trampin' all around this here place.

138
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:25,382
Helmick! Get everybody up to the Jeep!

139
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:30,561
I'm gonna buy me a pair
of buckskin shoes,

140
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:32,959
with a brand-new suit and a silk shirt.

141
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:36,412
And I'll be Charlie Potatoes,
comin' down the street,

142
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:39,194
with a Panama hat and a good-lookin' gal.

143
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,510
Come on, boy, you got a free arm.
Come on, boy, hit it. Come on, boy, hit it!

144
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,579
- Boy, eh?
- Hit it! Hit it!

145
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,072
No more "Yassuh, boss."

146
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,676
- I'll go to Rio and never be found.
- No more "Yassuh, boss"!

147
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,800
- I'll never be found!
- No more "Yassuh, boss"!

148
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,008
It won't break.

149
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,667
Need a chisel and a hammer.

150
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,846
- Come on, let's go.
- Go where?

151
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:21,395
- Pineville.
- Pineville's south. I don't go south.

152
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,984
I knew a girl in Pineville.
We'll get this broke.

153
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:27,149
Then what? A strange coloured man
in a white South town.

154
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,068
How long before they pick me up?

155
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,233
Get off my back!
I ain't married to you! Come on!

156
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,918
You married to me all right,
and here's the ring.

157
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,467
But I ain't goin' south on no
honeymoon. We goin' north.

158
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:41,824
- Through the swamp?
- We go around it.

159
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:45,277
I used to work a turpentine mill
60 miles north of here.

160
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:48,730
There's a train come to pick up
the turpentine every day.

161
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:53,525
It come out of the swamp and cross
the line to the paint makers in Ohio.

162
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:55,827
Now we try for that train.

163
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,800
- How long you been in jail?
- Eight years.

164
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:00,719
And the train's still runnin'?

165
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,404
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

166
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:06,473
Askin' me to go 60 miles with you
and you don't even know!

167
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:10,406
What are you invitin' me on?
A long walk off a short pier?

168
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:12,707
Nothin' doin'! Now come on!

169
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,818
Come on, damn you!

170
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:16,544
Come on!

171
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:21,435
- You're Charlie Potatoes, uh?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,984
You gonna dance down the street with
a gal on one arm and this on the other?

173
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:28,917
You gonna grab a boat to Rio,
pullin' your own anchor?

174
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:30,643
We can get this broke.

175
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:34,288
What you gonna do?
Bite it through with your teeth?

176
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,877
Maybe your head's hard enough!

177
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:41,769
The time's gonna come, Joker.
The time's gonna come.

178
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:45,413
But if you want it to be right here,
right now, that's OK with me.

179
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,770
You got the advantage of me -
tough to see if the light ain't good.

180
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,319
But you can hear me, Joker, so listen
good. Either we go north together,

181
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,347
or together we gonna go them 10 miles
right back onto Dead Street!

182
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,843
You're right, boy. You're right.

183
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:09,008
The time is gonna come.
It's sure gonna come.

184
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,748
All right. Now north is up that way.

185
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,187
( rock'n'roll)

186
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,393
All right, men, we're ready to move out.

187
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:20,517
The sheriff is in charge. I'm second in
command. You take your orders from us.

188
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,723
You will deploy into two groups,

189
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:27,423
pivotin' around the headquarters group,
which consists of the sheriff and myself.

190
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:31,739
You. Douse that radio.

191
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,398
One more thing.

192
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,946
This may take a couple of days.
Maybe more.

193
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:44,591
So all check your gear.
Your rations. Ponchos.

194
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:47,948
You new deputies,
you check with the troopers.

195
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,346
Keep your lines dressed. Don't fall behind.

196
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:51,688
Just one minute.

197
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:55,621
- Anythin' you'd like to add, Sheriff?
- Negative.

198
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,841
Deploy.

199
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:03,006
Let's move out.

200
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,188
( rock'n'roll)

201
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,757
I almost... swallowed half that river.

202
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,347
Thanks.

203
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,375
- What for?
- For pullin' me out.

204
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,691
Man, I didn't pull you out.
I kept you from pullin' me in.

205
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,801
( rock'n'roll)

206
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,885
What is it?

207
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,105
- You didn't approve of dogs.
- I got nothin' against dogs.

208
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:22,790
They're man's best friend, aren't they?

209
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:26,915
What are you lookin' for? Lipstick?

210
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:29,025
All right, Solly, get goin'.

211
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:32,861
Sheriff, I can't run my dogs
any more today. They need a rest.

212
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:37,944
- We got an hour of daylight left!
- Never mind. Our men need a rest, too.

213
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,630
- OK?
- OK, Solly.

214
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:45,425
It was that last waltz that did it.

215
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,591
You're givin' those cons
a pretty good head start.

216
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,797
They have to rest, too, you know.

217
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,784
You don't look so good yourself.

218
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:00,004
(croaking)

219
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:06,718
Now!

220
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,856
Got him!

221
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:19,091
(insects chirping)

222
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,352
(owls hooting)

223
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,668
Listen to 'em.

224
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,394
What are they?

225
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,312
Night birds mostly.

226
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:32,422
Bugs.

227
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:34,436
I wish they'd shut up.

228
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,026
Thanks.

229
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,809
- I keep listenin' for the dogs.
- It's too soon.

230
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,207
How fast do you think they can go?

231
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:52,564
Ain't no road. They gotta
come on foot, same as us.

232
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:58,414
- Animals in there?
- Some.

233
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:00,524
- What kind?
- All kinds.

234
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:03,977
- Like what?
- Like gators and...

235
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,375
Wild pig. Black bear.

236
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,828
- How come they don't make any noise?
- They animals.

237
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,281
They either bein' hunted or... huntin'.

238
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,925
Either way they don't make no noise.

239
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,666
I go with that.

240
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:33,134
Listen.

241
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:37,834
Must be a million of 'em. Not one of 'em
understands what the other one is sayin'.

242
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:39,752
They just bugs.

243
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:42,726
Bugs or people.
Nobody understands anybody.

244
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:47,138
Them animals, they're smarter.
You keep quiet and you hunt for yourself.

245
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,439
I go with that.

246
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,549
(distressed squeal)

247
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:55,290
(owl hoots)

248
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,839
What was that?

249
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,853
Weasel.

250
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,155
Hoot owl musta got him.

251
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,840
I thought you said they
didn't make any noise.

252
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:08,334
Only when they're dyin', Joker.

253
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:13,897
That's a great way to live.
You keep quiet all your life,

254
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,542
and the only time you open
your mouth is when you're dyin'.

255
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,488
Thanks.

256
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,886
Why don't you cut it out?

257
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:27,133
Hmm?

258
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:30,106
You keep saying "thanks".
I hate that word "thanks".

259
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:31,545
Don't mean nothin'.

260
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,998
You try makin' a livin'
with that word... you find out.

261
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:39,218
I used to park cars in Natchez.

262
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:44,301
A big fancy hotel. A fella'd give me
his car and I'd say "Thank you, sir."

263
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,274
I was doin' him a favour,
but I had to say "Thank you, sir."

264
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,248
- The louder I said it, the bigger the tip.
- That figures.

265
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,413
You gotta be Charlie Potatoes,
the man with the money.

266
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,098
Then you don't have to
bow down to nobody.

267
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,592
That's the way I'm gonna live.

268
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:02,236
Even when they didn't give me a tip
I still had to say thank you.

269
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:06,553
That word got like it was stickin'
needles in me every time I said it.

270
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,677
That can happen with a word.
You know what I mean, boy?

271
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:17,678
Yeah. And I got a needle stickin' in me
right now. Joker, don't call me "boy".

272
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,625
You're just too sensitive, man.

273
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:27,557
- I'm too nothin'.
- That's right. You're too nothin' is right.

274
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:30,914
But I got a little advice for you, man,
because I like you, man.

275
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:34,751
You gotta take things as they are.
You can't keep fighting 'em.

276
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,340
I see you got a lot to learn, boy.

277
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:40,793
Like you livin' in that fancy hotel?

278
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,862
Yeah. Like me livin' in that fancy hotel.

279
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,699
- You think they'll let me in that hotel?
- Sure they'll let you in that hotel.

280
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,384
Through the back door,
if you got a pail and a mop.

281
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:54,796
And you through the front door,
just long enough to collect your tip!

282
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:58,249
What's eatin' you?
Just because I called you a ni...

283
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,071
Yeah.

284
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,812
Well, that's what you are, ain't it?
It's like callin' a spade a spade.

285
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,306
I'm a hunky. I don't try to argue out of it.

286
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:08,799
You can call me a bohunk. I don't mind.

287
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:13,979
You ever hear tell of a bohunk
in a woodpile, Joker?

288
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:18,007
You ever hear tell of
"catch a bohunk by the toe"?

289
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,501
- Depends on how you mean it.
- How'd you mean it?

290
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,802
Don't crowd me!
I didn't make up no names!

291
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:27,214
No, you breathe it in when you're born,
and you spit it out from then on.

292
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:29,804
That name sure bugs you, don't it?

293
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:35,463
Well, that's the way it is, and you're stuck
with it, cos I didn't make any rules.

294
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,491
- No, but you sure live by 'em.
- Everybody lives by 'em.

295
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:42,656
- Even them swamp animals.
- Even that weasel.

296
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,862
You callin' me a weasel?

297
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,219
No, I'm callin' you a white man.

298
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,384
(hooting)

299
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,143
What's the matter?

300
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:19,486
Nothin'.

301
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,980
Come on, let's get outta here.

302
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:52,000
(distant voice) Gee up! Haaahh!

303
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:14,923
- Do you think he saw us?
- I don't know.

304
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:19,719
- What is this? Where are we?
- I think it's some kind of clay pit.

305
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,213
Come on, let's get outta here.

306
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,068
Why don't you... Let go of the chain!

307
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,274
You tellin' me what to do?!

308
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:53,288
Come on, let's try it again!

309
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:29,255
Let me try it...
Let me try it on your shoulders.

310
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:20,568
- Give me a little slack!
- I can't!

311
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:24,596
Don't let go now! Hold on!

312
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:26,227
Hold on!

313
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,764
I got it! I got it!

314
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:46,656
Don't slip! Hold on!

315
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,882
- What are you doin'?
- Lookin' at this hand.

316
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,280
- What for?
- Looks infected.

317
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:23,102
What you gonna do about it?

318
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:26,651
- It needs fixin'.
- Don't do me any favours.

319
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:29,336
I ain't doin' you no favours, Joker.

320
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:48,998
That feels nice and cool.

321
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:52,068
It's a poultice.

322
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,671
What do you want me to say?
Want me to say thanks?

323
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,645
All right. Thanks. Thanks.
Thanks. Thanks!

324
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:08,564
That word sure bugs you, don't it?

325
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,442
Well, I been sayin' it all my life.

326
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:14,799
When I was a kid, I didn't have no shoes.

327
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:19,978
In church I'd sit with the rest of the kids
and I'd say "Thank you, Lord! Thank you!"

328
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:23,623
Well, they didn't have
no shoes either, Joker.

329
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,500
All God's children got shoes.

330
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,034
Come on.

331
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,709
(dogs barking)

332
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,465
Muller speakin'. Kill the roadblocks.
They've headed north.

333
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:59,973
No, no chance of them circlin' back.
They're already across the McHenry.

334
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,810
The trail is still pretty fresh.
We should have 'em in a day or two.

335
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:07,454
Max, I've got somethin' I want
to say to you. It's important.

336
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:09,468
Get down.

337
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,921
Call my wife, will you?
Tell her everything's OK.

338
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:15,223
Listen, Max. This is important.

339
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:18,005
I'm not lettin' my dogs
cross that water out there.

340
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:19,060
Fine.

341
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:21,937
I'm lettin' nobody make me ruin my dogs.

342
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,294
I hope you treat your grandmother
the way you treat those dogs.

343
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:28,459
- Oh, that's funny.
- Wasn't meant to be.

344
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:34,885
Well, I think more of these here dogs
than I do of any two old stinkin' convicts.

345
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,091
Good. Good.

346
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:41,791
Max, you don't care if
I use your phone, do you?

347
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:45,052
( rock'n'roll)

348
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:47,162
Got anythin'?

349
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:50,231
Well, the way I got it figured,
we'll ford it here...

350
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:55,602
(radio off)

351
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,630
Regroup across the river,
then backtrack and pick up the trail.

352
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:02,412
- Fine.
- That detour will cost us two hours.

353
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,618
- Can't be helped.
- I think it could.

354
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:06,728
Why don't we call Cumberland?

355
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,413
For what? Ask for a tank
and armoured divisions?

356
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:12,099
They have a 12-hour start,
and we're about to lose two!

357
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:15,552
- I appreciate the arithmetic.
- Catchin' men is my business.

358
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,853
And makin' the decisions is mine.

359
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,720
It don't look like much.
That the company store?

360
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:34,830
Yeah.

361
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:38,858
There's tools in there,
and food too, waitin' for us.

362
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,860
They'll be asleep pretty soon. We better
hunker down before somebody sees us.

363
00:29:57,753 --> 00:29:59,575
(hogs snorting)

364
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:04,275
They sloppin' the hogs.

365
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:07,152
That means suppertime's over.

366
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:13,962
I used to feed the hogs
at the prison farm sometimes.

367
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,662
That sure was a nice farm.

368
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,210
Yeah. All that machinery.

369
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,883
You know somethin'? Fella get himself
a farm, he'd have a pretty sweet setup.

370
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,446
As long as a fella don't have to scratch it
out with hand tools and a mule.

371
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:38,995
Leastways you always got
somethin' to eat.

372
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,750
I worked 36 acres by hand once.

373
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:47,243
My wife...

374
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,463
My wife helped me.

375
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:55,012
Sometimes even my little kid.

376
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,136
Man, we never had enough to eat.

377
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:03,836
I didn't know you was married.

378
00:31:09,974 --> 00:31:12,276
What happened to your kid?

379
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:16,017
He was just five years old when I left.

380
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,621
He don't even remember me that much.

381
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:27,047
Everybody winds up alone.
Not just you. Everybody.

382
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,883
That's the way it is.

383
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:35,391
One down, five to go.

384
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:45,366
I got an old man around someplace.

385
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,778
The last time I seen him
was the day I got out of the army,

386
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:53,614
and we spent half my bonus cheque
gettin' lushed up together.

387
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:56,108
Ahh, I got nothin' against him.

388
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:59,465
My old man,

389
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:03,397
he was a Bible-thumper.

390
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,576
- Always tryin' to teach us somethin'.
- What's there to know?

391
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:11,358
I used to work in automobiles.
Transmission man.

392
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,345
$1.80 an hour, so some fink in a Cadillac
could drive it without havin' to shift gears.

393
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:20,565
- That's pretty good pay.
- You know what it meant to me?

394
00:32:20,949 --> 00:32:24,498
Saturday night in a gin mill,
bein' Charlie Potatoes with a blonde,

395
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,183
or maybe a redhead. Anythin' I wanted.

396
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:32,938
Then Monday mornin' there I was, back
in that pit with grease in my eyeballs.

397
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:36,487
- Somebody gotta fix them cars.
- Let somebody else fix them cars.

398
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,597
Me? I wanna drive 'em!

399
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,954
- You gotta buy 'em first.
- On a buck-eighty an hour?

400
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:45,023
That's just a stopover
for a second-hand Chevy.

401
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:49,723
Nah, not for me. I got smart.
You're a maker or a taker. Me, I'm a taker.

402
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,025
That's how you wound up in jail.

403
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:56,053
Because I didn't know how to be
a big enough taker. I was just a stealer.

404
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,177
You gotta be a big enough crook
so you can get away with anythin'.

405
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:05,932
Just a few more lights now.

406
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:12,646
What did they get you for?

407
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:15,427
Assault and battery. Intent to kill.

408
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:17,537
Oh, that's great.

409
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,606
Man come on my land
cos I didn't pay the note.

410
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,579
When I gave him an argument,
he pulled a gun on me.

411
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:27,320
- I took it away from him.
- They put you in jail for that?

412
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:29,814
I whipped his head good.

413
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,650
Were you gonna kill him?

414
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:36,240
Maybe.

415
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:41,707
- If they hadn't pulled me off him, I would.
- You gotta roll with them punches.

416
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,050
Yeah!

417
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:45,351
What are you gettin' so mad about?

418
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:47,557
I ain't gettin' mad, Joker.

419
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:50,435
I been mad all my natural life.

420
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:54,175
- I'm just tellin' you the facts of life.
- I don't wanna hear it.

421
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:58,395
I been listenin' to that stuff all my life.
From my wife: "Be nice."

422
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:02,903
They throwed me in solitary confinement,
and she said "Be nice."

423
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:08,466
A man'd shortweight me. She'd say
"Be nice, or you get in trouble."

424
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,344
She'd teach my kid that same damn thing.

425
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:21,222
I never could get that woman to
understand how I was feelin' inside.

426
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,416
All of a sudden there
was nothin' left to say.

427
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,322
Ain't they never goin' to sleep?

428
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,873
I used to think,

429
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:56,230
if I could get away someplace,

430
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:00,738
someplace where folks
weren't always so afraid,

431
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:04,671
maybe she won't be
so afraid all the time.

432
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:11,480
Well...

433
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:16,851
There you go.

434
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:24,141
Well, that buttons it up for the night.

435
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:28,457
If we leave now they'll be asleep
when we get down there. Come on.

436
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:30,759
What?

437
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,020
Your white face shines out
like a full moon.

438
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:37,568
- What am I gonna do about it?
- I don't know what you're...

439
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,268
Here.

440
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:52,530
- How's that?
- Missed a couple of spots.

441
00:35:56,367 --> 00:36:00,587
- Now just the meanness shines through.
- Then we sure look alike.

442
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:02,601
Check. Come on.

443
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:07,205
(insects chirping)

444
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:47,392
(dog barks)

445
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,013
(crow squawks)

446
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,224
Chain.

447
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:02,915
Can't see much.

448
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,546
Go on.

449
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,497
I... I can't reach it.

450
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:36,389
(cans clattering)

451
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,499
(dogs bark)

452
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,239
- I'm slippin'.
- Grab a hold of the chain.

453
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:45,596
Urgh!

454
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,010
Grab a hold of the chain!

455
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,055
(loud crash)

456
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:22,522
- How you doin', Joker?
- My wrist... My wrist...

457
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,632
(dogs barking)

458
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,469
I bet we woke up this whole town.

459
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:33,360
- Somebody's in there! I heard 'em!
- Hey! Over here!

460
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,923
- Do you see anybody?
- There's somebody in there!

461
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:42,664
- Where's Claude? He's got the key.
- Forget it! Let's try the back door.

462
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:44,870
They're in there, I know it.

463
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:59,640
You hang on to me, Joker, the best way
you can. We're gettin' outta here.

464
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:09,615
Hey, come on back here!

465
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:15,465
Hold it, you guys!

466
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:24,769
Here they are!

467
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:32,250
Hold it!

468
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:37,813
- Looks like you two boys are in trouble.
- Mac, they hurt Joe real bad!

469
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,594
Say! This one's white!

470
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:46,061
Here, Max. You look pretty beat.

471
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:50,090
I figured sure we'd grab 'em
sometime today.

472
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,392
Take it easy.
Here comes Captain Bligh.

473
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,597
( rock'n'roll)

474
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:04,380
- How about a nice hot coffee, Captain?
- No.

475
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:07,354
- I thought you'd want the casualty report.
- Go ahead.

476
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:08,697
Three men.

477
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,711
- How bad?
- Legs.

478
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:13,300
- Send 'em back.
- Someone's gotta go with 'em.

479
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:16,178
- Pick someone out.
- That's a lot of men outta the line.

480
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:19,630
- What about it?
- Solly says the trail'll get no fresher.

481
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:20,781
So?

482
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:24,906
So I'd like to make it a matter of record
that I requested help. You refused.

483
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:28,838
- It's your responsibility.
- It is my responsibility.

484
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:31,140
Anythin' else you'd like to remind me of?

485
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,674
Just this.

486
00:42:32,962 --> 00:42:36,607
I happen to be civil service.
I don't have to worry about my job.

487
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:45,431
Got a point there, Max.

488
00:42:46,582 --> 00:42:49,075
If I listened to him
I'd be callin' out the marines.

489
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:54,638
If they get away because you refused
to call in help, you'll look pretty foolish.

490
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:57,420
And I'd have to print it, Max.

491
00:42:57,612 --> 00:43:00,105
Look, let me tell you somethin', Dave.

492
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:05,572
I got a wife and two kids. And a mortgage.

493
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,545
My job as sheriff pays me 6800 a year.

494
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:11,327
It comes in steady.
I don't have to work too hard.

495
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,780
It's a good setup and I like it.
But don't frighten me about losin' it.

496
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:17,369
I can always go back to practisin' law.

497
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:21,014
Max... no offence.
We've been friends a long time.

498
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:25,522
You never made much of a livin'
as a lawyer. Stop kiddin' yourself.

499
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:34,729
I didn't think it was possible, but
I'm beginnin' to hate those two men.

500
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,703
I'll get them.

501
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,692
Rafe, get rid of the women and children.

502
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:51,802
Come on, ladies. Let's go.

503
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:55,350
- What you men fixin' to do?
- Old-fashioned prayer meetin', ma'am.

504
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:57,844
Let's go now. Come on. Let's go.

505
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:04,174
Prayer meetin'. That's pretty funny.

506
00:44:04,462 --> 00:44:06,093
Give us a break, buddy, uh?

507
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,682
I ain't your buddy. You got your buddy.

508
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:11,751
Which one of you did it?

509
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:14,725
Did you do it?

510
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,027
Why did you do it?

511
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,288
- How is he, Sam?
- He ain't come to yet.

512
00:44:20,479 --> 00:44:23,165
- He oughta be all right.
- He oughta be.

513
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:27,097
Did he do it?

514
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,687
Are you protectin' your buddy?

515
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:33,427
It don't matter. You're both gonna hang.

516
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:37,168
You can't do anythin' to us.
We're escaped cons.

517
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:39,086
- So?
- So they're lookin' for us.

518
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:40,813
What you gonna do when they find us?

519
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,882
You gonna be crow meat
when they find you.

520
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:46,471
Well, you ain't gonna get away with it.

521
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:50,212
Nobody's gonna know
who pulled the rope.

522
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:55,871
Don't you know there's a reward
for escaped convicts?

523
00:44:57,693 --> 00:45:00,091
Rewards always say "dead or alive".

524
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,243
Don't you understand?

525
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:10,449
You can't go lynchin' me.

526
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,559
I'm a white man!

527
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,629
You are?

528
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,410
I'll tell you the kind of white man you are.

529
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:22,342
- Spit on him.
- For God's sake...

530
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:25,124
- Go on! Spit on him.
- Mac...

531
00:45:25,316 --> 00:45:27,234
Let me alone, Sam!

532
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:30,495
We're just havin' a little fun, huh, boys?

533
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,893
Come on, you heard me.

534
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:40,662
Wait!

535
00:45:40,853 --> 00:45:43,059
Outta my way, Sam,
or you'll have trouble, too.

536
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:46,992
- I told you. Joe's gonna be all right.
- You told me. Fine!

537
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,651
You just don't give a damn, do ya?

538
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:02,242
All right. The rest of you big men,
you wanna lynch 'em, huh?

539
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,886
You, Glover.

540
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:09,051
You look anxious. Go ahead.

541
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,641
Tie it around their necks. Go on!

542
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:17,492
You want blood, huh?

543
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:20,753
Well, here. Go ahead! Chop 'em up!

544
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,479
Go on!

545
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,344
Or do you wanna burn 'em?

546
00:46:30,536 --> 00:46:34,372
Do you wanna burn 'em, huh?
You wanna burn 'em?

547
00:46:35,811 --> 00:46:39,551
Or do you wanna burn 'em?
Go on! Burn 'em!

548
00:46:41,374 --> 00:46:42,621
Mac!

549
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,526
Go on! Burn their eyes out!

550
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,227
Now,

551
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,529
any more big men?

552
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,380
Joe's all right.
Took six stitches, but he's OK.

553
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:13,216
All right. Lock them two up.

554
00:47:13,504 --> 00:47:16,669
I'll take 'em back in the mornin'
in the wagons.

555
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:20,506
Put Mac in the shack where he belongs.
The rest of you go to bed.

556
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:44,771
Long gone

557
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,320
Ain't he lucky

558
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,403
Long gone

559
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,856
To Kentucky

560
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:01,268
Long gone

561
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:05,297
What I mean

562
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,941
Long gone Sam on a bowlin' green

563
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:11,723
Bowlin' green

564
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,998
Sewin' machine

565
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:21,410
Little kitten sittin'

566
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,342
On a sewin' machine

567
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:30,042
Sewin' machine

568
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:34,454
Sew so fast

569
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,866
Sew eleven stitches

570
00:48:40,592 --> 00:48:43,374
You musta been crazy
to do a thing like that.

571
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:46,826
They might've beat us to death.
They still might.

572
00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:50,375
What you got to live for, Joker?

573
00:48:50,663 --> 00:48:54,307
You wanna spend the next 20 years
on some chain gang, bustin' rock?

574
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,801
It's better than bein' dead.

575
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,638
You ever seen a lynchin'?

576
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:01,885
Why?

577
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:07,160
Cos anybody as scared as you was, man,
they... they got to have seen a lynchin'.

578
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:10,517
Yeah, I seen a lynchin'.
I seen what they do to a guy,

579
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:15,120
how they drag him outta jail in the middle
of the night, like that mob out there.

580
00:49:15,408 --> 00:49:17,710
They start drinkin'.
Then they start thinkin'.

581
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:20,204
And Big Sam, he falls asleep somewhere.

582
00:49:20,395 --> 00:49:23,561
Then that mob comes in here
and they get us. Then what?

583
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:28,932
That's mighty easy for you, Joker.
You just tell 'em you're a white man.

584
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:34,495
(lock being forced open)

585
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:56,458
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?
I didn't hear any wagon bein' hitched up.

586
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,377
I'm lettin' you loose.

587
00:49:58,472 --> 00:50:00,583
What do you mean,
you're lettin' us loose?

588
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,364
I already told you. I'm lettin' you loose.

589
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:18,998
Wait a minute.

590
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:32,329
How about lettin' us have that crowbar?

591
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:35,399
Don't go to pressin' your luck too far, boy.

592
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,645
Come on.

593
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:38,276
Wait a minute.

594
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,249
If you get caught,
wasn't nobody let you loose.

595
00:50:41,537 --> 00:50:43,743
You broke out yourselves. Understand?

596
00:50:43,935 --> 00:50:45,853
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

597
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:57,938
Run, chicken.

598
00:50:58,226 --> 00:50:59,472
Run.

599
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,582
( rock'n'roll)

600
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,631
Hold on, man. Wait. Wait.

601
00:51:37,645 --> 00:51:39,563
I gotta rest.

602
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:50,689
We musta run a million miles.

603
00:51:51,552 --> 00:51:53,854
How far do you think we run?

604
00:51:57,883 --> 00:52:02,295
Man, you sure can run. You'd have killed
us both if I didn't make you stop.

605
00:52:11,118 --> 00:52:14,763
Why don't you say somethin'?
What have you got to squawk about?

606
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:16,873
We got away, didn't we?

607
00:52:20,422 --> 00:52:22,436
You got nothin' to say, huh?

608
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,944
You oughta be thankin' me.

609
00:52:27,136 --> 00:52:30,589
You didn't put up any fight.
I had to do all the talkin'.

610
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:36,727
Look, man, don't gimme that look.

611
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:41,331
You shoulda got what was comin' to ya,
after spittin' in that guy's face.

612
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:44,975
Why, you...!

613
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:48,332
You afraid of catchin' my colour?

614
00:52:48,524 --> 00:52:52,169
- You pickin' a hand to me?
- To you? The bigshot taker?

615
00:52:52,456 --> 00:52:54,471
You're just a talker!

616
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:03,007
Tell me all about Charlie Potatoes, when
the chain's off and nobody's chasin' ya!

617
00:53:03,294 --> 00:53:04,158
Come on.

618
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,596
You can't, can ya?

619
00:53:05,692 --> 00:53:09,721
You can't, because you're nothin'. Not
even a man! You're a monkey on a stick!

620
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:13,557
That cracker mob back there -
they pulled the string and you jumped!

621
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:17,585
You said one day
we were gonna tangle, Joker.

622
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:20,750
You said the time was gonna come,
and that time is now!

623
00:53:57,005 --> 00:54:00,842
- I'm gonna kill you!
- That's right, white man.

624
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:03,335
You kill me.

625
00:54:17,147 --> 00:54:19,640
Only it ain't so easy to kill me, is it?

626
00:54:20,887 --> 00:54:23,285
(kid) Put up your hands!

627
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:26,354
Come on up here!

628
00:54:51,675 --> 00:54:53,785
- Let's get outta here!
- Wait a minute.

629
00:54:53,977 --> 00:54:56,950
- Cullen, there may be people around!
- Wait a minute!

630
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:04,527
- He bumped his head.
- Come on.

631
00:55:12,296 --> 00:55:14,310
Let me go!

632
00:55:14,502 --> 00:55:18,146
Keep him away from me!
Don't let him hurt me!

633
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:22,942
- He ain't gonna hurt ya.
- Where you live, kid?

634
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:25,628
- Go on, answer him.
- Over the hill.

635
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:27,834
That way?

636
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:29,560
- Tell him.
- Yeah.

637
00:55:29,752 --> 00:55:32,150
- What you doin' out here?
- Huntin'.

638
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:36,466
- Your pa let you out huntin' by yourself?
- He ain't here no more.

639
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:42,604
- Who you live with?
- My ma.

640
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,769
- Just you and your ma?
- Uh-huh.

641
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:50,661
How come you're chained together
like that? Are you takin' him to jail?

642
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,442
Well, somethin' like that.

643
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:57,950
You must have a lot of friends,
a smart kid like you. A lot of neighbours.

644
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:01,403
Uh-uh. Just Ma and me.
We work the farm.

645
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:06,102
Sometimes on Sunday we go over to
Cumberland, to visit my Uncle George.

646
00:56:06,486 --> 00:56:08,788
- What's your name, boy?
- Billy.

647
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,665
Billy, uh? Come on,
we'll get you home, Billy.

648
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:38,137
What's the matter?

649
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:41,110
Nothin', Ma. I'm all right.

650
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,179
What do you want?

651
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,824
Don't get excited, lady.
All we want is somethin' to eat.

652
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:54,442
Come on.

653
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,088
Kid, come here.

654
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,774
- Where you goin'?
- You wanted somethin' to eat.

655
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:11,514
- You got a chisel and a big hammer?
- In the shed, if I can find 'em.

656
00:57:11,706 --> 00:57:14,296
- Is it OK, Ma?
- Go ahead.

657
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:24,079
Where's his? Get him some.

658
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,805
Go on!

659
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:36,835
You ain't feelin' so good, eh, Joker?

660
00:57:37,027 --> 00:57:39,520
I'm feelin' fine. Don't worry about me.

661
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:41,822
I ain't worried about ya.

662
00:57:43,645 --> 00:57:45,947
- I got some coffee.
- Thanks.

663
00:57:53,524 --> 00:57:55,442
Him too?

664
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:24,599
What are you lookin' at?

665
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:39,657
Where you from?

666
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:42,726
You can talk to me.

667
00:58:43,973 --> 00:58:46,371
You don't have to be afraid to talk to me.

668
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,728
Gets lonesome here.

669
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:53,948
That's a nice picture.

670
00:58:56,442 --> 00:58:58,839
- I made it myself.
- Oh, yeah?

671
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:01,525
It ain't so much. You buy 'em in the store.

672
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:05,649
It's got numbers on it where you're
supposed to put the colours, you know.

673
00:59:05,937 --> 00:59:08,047
It's all right.

674
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:10,541
I like pretty things.

675
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:16,008
Did you paint that one, too?

676
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,405
That?

677
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:19,844
No.

678
00:59:20,132 --> 00:59:22,626
No, I cut that out of a magazine.

679
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,654
What is it?

680
00:59:26,846 --> 00:59:30,203
"A scene of gay revelry at the
Mardi Gras in Old New Orleans."

681
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,368
Where's that kid?

682
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,670
He'll be back.

683
00:59:36,437 --> 00:59:38,739
Relax, Cullen. He'll be back.

684
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,438
Uh...

685
00:59:43,726 --> 00:59:45,932
I've been to the Mardi Gras.

686
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:49,865
Yeah? Is it really like what it says?

687
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:51,879
It's all right.

688
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:54,468
You mean it ain't like what it says?

689
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:58,880
No, it's fine. It's very nice.
A lot of music and a lot of dancin'.

690
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:02,717
Good-lookin' women.

691
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:04,443
Oh, I...

692
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:08,184
I must look awful. I...
I been doin' the washin'.

693
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:16,432
Are you gonna be stayin' long?

694
01:00:16,624 --> 01:00:17,871
No?

695
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:22,379
They comin' after you?

696
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,011
There's a train.

697
01:00:31,203 --> 01:00:35,327
Tomorrow. Hits the ridge about
one o'clock in the afternoon.

698
01:00:35,614 --> 01:00:39,643
It's a good place to catch it, too.
It goes slow up the ridge.

699
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:47,316
How come... how come you know
so much about the train?

700
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:49,426
My husband used to work for the line.

701
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:51,152
I found 'em.

702
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,662
- You got enough room for a swing?
- You just hold that chain, Joker.

703
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:11,006
Now me.

704
01:01:13,308 --> 01:01:15,226
Here, hold that.

705
01:01:32,586 --> 01:01:34,504
We cut loose now.

706
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,629
What's the matter with him?

707
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,000
He's sick. He got poison in his system.

708
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:46,877
- Heat some water!
- Stay where you are, kid.

709
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:49,179
Do like I told you!

710
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:52,440
Well, you get in there with him.

711
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:11,143
All right, they hit you. Then what?
What did you do to them?

712
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:15,267
I don't know. The next thing I know,
the doctor is fixin' me up.

713
01:02:17,952 --> 01:02:20,254
Do you know what happened last night?

714
01:02:22,077 --> 01:02:23,995
No, huh?

715
01:02:24,858 --> 01:02:26,680
You, lady?

716
01:02:28,023 --> 01:02:30,900
You? Were you deaf and blind
last night, too?

717
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,915
They sent us women away.

718
01:02:33,106 --> 01:02:34,449
Why?

719
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:36,559
Ask them.

720
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,767
Sam, what did you do with 'em?

721
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:49,411
Like I told you before, Sheriff.
We caught 'em, locked 'em up.

722
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,617
They broke out and ran away.

723
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:54,207
Those jimmy marks are
on the outside of the door.

724
01:02:54,495 --> 01:02:58,427
They didn't break out. Somebody
broke in and got them. Who was it?

725
01:02:58,715 --> 01:03:03,415
I wouldn't know about that, Sheriff.
I run a turpentine camp, not a jail.

726
01:03:03,702 --> 01:03:06,580
Who came for them, Sam?
Who came and got them?

727
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,608
Sam, if you lynched 'em,
you'd better tell me now.

728
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,910
The dogs are gonna find 'em anyhow.

729
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:19,432
Why'd we wanna kill 'em? Appears to me
like you're better rigged for that than us.

730
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:21,734
All right, that's enough.

731
01:03:23,844 --> 01:03:25,282
Solly, get goin'.

732
01:03:25,378 --> 01:03:29,215
You've been rushin' my dogs since
early this mornin'! They're bushed!

733
01:03:29,503 --> 01:03:32,668
I'm tired of your complaining
about your dogs!

734
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:34,874
Will you get goin'!

735
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,039
Wait, Max. How about us?
We're dead tired on our feet.

736
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:40,437
- Max, have a heart.
- It'll be dark soon.

737
01:03:40,724 --> 01:03:43,602
You wanted to be deputies, didn't you?

738
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:47,438
Well, you're under orders,
so get ready to move out!

739
01:03:47,726 --> 01:03:48,781
Come on, come on.

740
01:03:48,877 --> 01:03:52,905
Call Cumberland. Tell them
I want every man they can spare.

741
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:57,413
These men better be field-equipped.
It'll be dark before they can get started.

742
01:03:57,701 --> 01:04:01,249
I don't care when they start!
You get them movin'!

743
01:04:02,496 --> 01:04:04,223
All right, Sheriff.

744
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,045
All right.

745
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:15,061
You know that's the first time
I seen him smile?

746
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:17,075
Yeah.

747
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:51,644
- Where is he?
- Shh!

748
01:05:55,672 --> 01:05:58,358
- How long I been asleep?
- Couple of hours.

749
01:05:58,645 --> 01:06:00,947
- Where's the kid?
- In the other room.

750
01:06:02,194 --> 01:06:04,784
- I'd better wake Cullen.
- No.

751
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:06,798
Don't go yet.

752
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:10,443
- You're feverish. You got plenty of time.
- What time is it?

753
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,649
About two o'clock.

754
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:16,965
- You been sittin' here all night?
- Mm-hm.

755
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,034
Why don't you go and get some sleep?

756
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:22,144
I want to stay.

757
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:26,939
What is it?

758
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:33,461
I was thinkin' of the last time somebody
sat up all night takin' care of me.

759
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:36,626
Your wife?

760
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:38,928
No.

761
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:44,683
A skinny old man with a moustache.
He had red eyes and a torn T-shirt.

762
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:48,711
He was an orderly in the prison hospital.

763
01:06:48,903 --> 01:06:52,164
I had a sunstroke from
workin' on the road gang.

764
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:56,384
I ain't married.

765
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:00,125
What's it like?

766
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:03,290
- What's what like?
- You know. Prison.

767
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:09,332
How you gonna explain it?

768
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,922
Is it lonesome?

769
01:07:13,553 --> 01:07:15,375
Yeah.

770
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:19,787
What happened to your old man?

771
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:22,376
He run off... eight months ago.

772
01:07:23,815 --> 01:07:25,733
I been stuck here.

773
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,378
Must get pretty lonesome for ya.

774
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,543
It's like that in jail, ain't it?

775
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:36,380
Yeah. It's like that.

776
01:07:39,832 --> 01:07:42,997
- Does it ever get really bad?
- Mm-hm.

777
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:45,971
No. No, I mean...

778
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:50,958
I mean so bad that you just feel
kinda empty inside. You know?

779
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:56,617
Like a big empty thing, and all you
wanna do is fill it up with tears.

780
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:01,029
I'll tell you somethin'.

781
01:08:01,604 --> 01:08:04,098
You fill it up with tears and you're a goner.

782
01:08:04,865 --> 01:08:06,688
What can you do?

783
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,428
I fill it up with dreams.

784
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:14,552
You gotta know about somethin'
before you can dream about it.

785
01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:16,758
No, you don't.

786
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,307
Look, I was born 20 miles from here.

787
01:08:20,978 --> 01:08:23,856
And I just don't know nothin' else.

788
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:27,021
You don't have to know.

789
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:29,611
All you have to do is want.

790
01:08:30,378 --> 01:08:33,927
Then you make up a million pictures
in your own head.

791
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,516
- Pictures?
- Mm-hm.

792
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:40,640
- What kind of pictures?
- All kinds of pictures.

793
01:08:41,695 --> 01:08:45,244
Different things, different places,
different people.

794
01:08:45,532 --> 01:08:49,081
All the things you ever wanted,
but you ain't gonna get.

795
01:08:49,848 --> 01:08:53,109
Sometimes it's music and
bright lights and paper streamers,

796
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,699
and I'm dancin' in the streets.

797
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,494
Like the Mardi Gras?

798
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:03,467
Mm-hm. Just like the Mardi Gras.

799
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:09,606
And sometimes...

800
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,881
Sometimes I'm on a boat, a long boat,

801
01:09:15,073 --> 01:09:18,142
and... I'm goin' far away.

802
01:09:20,252 --> 01:09:23,609
I'm goin' to places
that I never seen before.

803
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,117
White sand.

804
01:09:30,227 --> 01:09:32,049
Hot sun.

805
01:09:34,447 --> 01:09:36,269
And tall buildings.

806
01:09:38,283 --> 01:09:40,585
All tall buildings...

807
01:09:41,832 --> 01:09:44,901
reachin' way up into the sky.

808
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:49,793
Tall buildings made of glass.

809
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,288
And there's always somebody waitin'.

810
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:03,316
Somebody clean,

811
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:06,769
and warm,

812
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:08,112
and nice.

813
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:15,018
Is she beautiful?

814
01:10:23,074 --> 01:10:24,992
I better get Cullen.

815
01:10:29,404 --> 01:10:31,514
Is she prettier than me?

816
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:36,406
It's been so long.

817
01:10:40,242 --> 01:10:43,407
I get the dreams mixed up
with the real thing.

818
01:10:45,134 --> 01:10:47,052
It's real now.

819
01:10:50,889 --> 01:10:52,807
Don't go away.

820
01:10:54,054 --> 01:10:55,972
I ain't goin' anywhere.

821
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:22,060
Don't go away.

822
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:27,143
(insects chirping)

823
01:11:32,898 --> 01:11:34,816
(birds singing)

824
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:44,352
Hi.

825
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:46,846
- Mornin'! You're up early.
- Uh-huh.

826
01:12:54,519 --> 01:12:57,300
- I'll change your dressin'.
- It's OK.

827
01:13:02,576 --> 01:13:04,398
That's great.

828
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:08,906
Thank you.

829
01:13:17,442 --> 01:13:19,264
- I made you some breakfast.
- Fine.

830
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,580
- What's that? That your old man's?
- Mm-hm.

831
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:27,513
You're just about the same size.

832
01:13:27,704 --> 01:13:31,349
You're a good-lookin' woman.
He must've been crazy to leave.

833
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:34,226
Oh, this place is no good. It needs a man.

834
01:13:34,418 --> 01:13:38,255
- He'll be back one day.
- Yeah? Well, I won't be here.

835
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:42,283
- Where you figure on goin'?
- Where do you?

836
01:13:43,242 --> 01:13:45,256
- I'm bound for Rio.
- Listen...

837
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:47,942
- I ain't got time.
- Wait a minute.

838
01:13:49,668 --> 01:13:53,121
- You like me, don't you?
- Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.

839
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,478
Take me with you.

840
01:13:57,437 --> 01:14:01,753
- Law's on my tail. I'm runnin' scared.
- I don't care. Take me with you.

841
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:05,685
- You gonna ride the freights with me?
- We don't have to. I got a car.

842
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,193
- A car?
- In the shed, in back.

843
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:14,797
Wait a minute! It's busted! It won't start!

844
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:22,470
- Get in and try it!
- Well, it won't start.

845
01:14:22,662 --> 01:14:24,580
- How long's it been here?
- Three weeks.

846
01:14:24,772 --> 01:14:26,594
All right, hit it.

847
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:30,143
- Try it again. Try it again!
- I am!

848
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:33,596
- It's the battery. You got a crank?
- I don't know. Do I?

849
01:14:36,665 --> 01:14:38,967
- Put it in neutral.
- It's in neutral.

850
01:14:39,926 --> 01:14:41,269
OK?

851
01:14:46,832 --> 01:14:48,654
(engine starts)

852
01:14:53,354 --> 01:14:55,464
- I gotta get Cullen.
- We can't take him!

853
01:14:55,656 --> 01:14:57,766
- Why not?
- They'll recognise you!

854
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:02,273
- They're gonna spot us anyway.
- No, we'll travel as man and wife.

855
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:04,479
What about Cullen?

856
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,357
What's the difference if they're
followin' one or two of you?

857
01:15:07,644 --> 01:15:09,179
What about Billy?

858
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:12,056
We can drop him off at my brother's,
then go south.

859
01:15:12,344 --> 01:15:14,742
We're goin' too fast. I gotta think.

860
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:18,291
Honey, there ain't no time to think.
Will you come on?

861
01:15:19,633 --> 01:15:22,894
All right. All right, get packed.
We'll leave in a couple...

862
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:31,239
(engine still running)

863
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:40,446
Nice shirt.

864
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,228
We're goin' south.

865
01:15:44,762 --> 01:15:46,968
- We?
- Me and her.

866
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,764
- In this?
- Yeah, it runs.

867
01:15:53,203 --> 01:15:56,272
Yeah? You're wastin' your gas.

868
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:58,765
(engine off)

869
01:15:59,053 --> 01:16:01,547
They'll be watchin' the roads.

870
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:04,616
They'll be watchin' where
the dogs are goin'.

871
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:08,548
That kinda makes me the bait, don't it?

872
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:14,687
Cullen, travellin' together we're like
a sign that says "come and get us".

873
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:19,003
He's too weak to travel on foot anyway.

874
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:25,717
You got the same chance alone.
Maybe better.

875
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,857
I'll fix you somethin' to eat.

876
01:16:49,599 --> 01:16:51,613
You got it all figured out.

877
01:16:56,313 --> 01:16:58,806
Hey, you better go and get washed, Billy.

878
01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:06,575
How far is it to that railroad?

879
01:17:06,863 --> 01:17:09,261
About 12 miles,
if you go through the hills.

880
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:11,850
I'm fixin' sandwiches.
There's coffee there.

881
01:17:12,138 --> 01:17:14,152
If I go through the hills?

882
01:17:14,344 --> 01:17:17,413
Or you can short-cut through the swamp.

883
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:18,468
Swamp?

884
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,921
Save you a couple of hours.
Make it harder for the dogs.

885
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,415
You can find it easy.

886
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:27,004
Which way is that?

887
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,978
Go right up here by the shed.
You'll see a path.

888
01:17:30,265 --> 01:17:33,239
Follow that till you get to the swamp.

889
01:17:33,526 --> 01:17:37,746
You'll see a great big cypress over on
your left about half a mile. Follow that.

890
01:17:38,034 --> 01:17:38,993
Then what?

891
01:17:39,089 --> 01:17:43,885
Then nothin'. The rest is easy.
Just head for the railroad, that's all.

892
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,599
Thanks for the grub.

893
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:58,272
Hey, Cullen.

894
01:17:59,135 --> 01:18:00,190
Yeah?

895
01:18:02,588 --> 01:18:04,602
So long.

896
01:18:06,712 --> 01:18:08,726
So long, Joker.

897
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:48,433
Here, I'll burn that.

898
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,709
Not now, honey, please...
We got plenty of time. Suppose...

899
01:19:04,451 --> 01:19:06,465
We're goin' on a trip to Cumberland.

900
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:08,287
- Now?
- Now.

901
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,507
- Go and take your clothes off the line.
- Cumberland? With him?

902
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:14,234
Yeah.

903
01:19:14,426 --> 01:19:16,344
You like him, don't you?

904
01:19:16,536 --> 01:19:18,550
Sure. He's all right.

905
01:19:18,742 --> 01:19:20,660
Well, go on.

906
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:26,798
You better talk to that kid.

907
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:29,580
On the way. He's a smart kid.

908
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,460
I wonder what they'll do
to Cullen if they catch him.

909
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,666
Don't worry, they won't.

910
01:19:56,147 --> 01:19:59,504
- What makes you so sure?
- Look, will you quit worryin'?

911
01:19:59,696 --> 01:20:04,875
They ain't gonna catch him, cos he ain't
never gonna get out of that swamp alive.

912
01:20:06,793 --> 01:20:08,903
What? Didn't you tell him right?

913
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:12,452
There ain't no right.
It's all bogs and quicksand.

914
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:17,440
Why'd you do it?

915
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:21,084
Well, suppose they caught him?
What if he told 'em?

916
01:20:22,907 --> 01:20:25,017
What if he told 'em what?

917
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:29,333
What if he told 'em what?
What could he tell 'em?

918
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,690
So they wouldn't come lookin'.
So we could have time.

919
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:37,293
- Time for what?
- Time! Time for us to get away!

920
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:41,705
To get to a city - a big city,
so big they could never find you!

921
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:47,556
Oh, look! Look, I got $400
insurance money saved up.

922
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:51,201
We could live good.
Do all those things you was talkin' about.

923
01:20:51,392 --> 01:20:55,229
We could go dancin', and eat
in restaurants, and go to shows.

924
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,435
You could start a whole new life.

925
01:20:57,627 --> 01:21:00,984
And when we needed more money
I could sell the farm...

926
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:05,779
- What should I do with these?
- You'll think of somethin'.

927
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:08,944
- Drop 'em down the well.
- Like you dropped Cullen in the swamp.

928
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:12,877
What are you gettin' so excited
about that Negro for? I did it for you!

929
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:16,425
- You don't even know me!
- For us! For the two of us!

930
01:21:16,713 --> 01:21:20,741
- You don't even know my name.
- Well, I don't care what they call ya!

931
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:24,482
They call me Johnny. That's what
they call me. They call me Johnny.

932
01:21:24,674 --> 01:21:27,167
Johnny. Oh, Johnny...

933
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:29,757
You don't even know me.

934
01:21:30,141 --> 01:21:33,881
Please, we don't have time. You said so
yourself. They're comin' after ya.

935
01:21:34,073 --> 01:21:36,183
You don't know anythin' about me.

936
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:39,636
No! Where you goin'?!

937
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,130
- Get outta the way!
- What'd I do wrong?!

938
01:21:42,321 --> 01:21:44,240
Please, what'd I do wrong?

939
01:21:44,527 --> 01:21:46,733
Listen to me, Johnny. Please listen.

940
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:50,186
All my life I've been waitin'
to get away from here.

941
01:21:50,378 --> 01:21:52,872
From the mud gumbo, and the loneliness.

942
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:58,435
I'd only see my husband two times
a week, and he didn't come back.

943
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:02,751
I don't blame him, but I don't
wanna stay here either.

944
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:07,738
Oh, Johnny, I'm beggin' ya!
Oh, please take me with ya!

945
01:22:08,026 --> 01:22:10,807
Don't leave me here, Johnny, please...

946
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,564
( rock'n'roll)

947
01:22:27,496 --> 01:22:31,236
- Charlie, bring in that water, will you?
- Here. Take your full ration.

948
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,689
- Kid, what'd they talk about?
- I don't know.

949
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:36,991
You don't know, uh? OK, beat it.

950
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:39,677
They're not around here.
Everything's clear.

951
01:22:39,869 --> 01:22:44,568
All right, so they ate. Then what?
They must've taken somethin' with 'em!

952
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:49,076
- Nothin' you could put 'em in jail for.
- Lady, you're not cooperatin'.

953
01:22:49,268 --> 01:22:51,953
Let's not waste any more time, Frank.

954
01:22:53,968 --> 01:22:55,886
OK, let's go.

955
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:02,408
Look, ma'am, I don't know what
you've been thinkin' or why.

956
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:08,450
Whatever it is, it can't work. Cos,
so help me, they're goin' back in jail.

957
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,013
Cullen!

958
01:23:16,219 --> 01:23:17,658
Cullen!

959
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:19,480
Where are you?!

960
01:23:19,672 --> 01:23:20,631
Cullen!

961
01:23:24,372 --> 01:23:25,618
Cullen!

962
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:29,743
Cullen, where are you?!

963
01:23:31,565 --> 01:23:32,812
Cullen!

964
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:34,634
Cullen!

965
01:23:38,662 --> 01:23:40,101
Cullen!

966
01:23:42,403 --> 01:23:44,321
Cullen, where are you?!

967
01:23:44,513 --> 01:23:46,431
Cullen!

968
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:51,227
What do you want?

969
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,543
- Cullen, I been lookin' all over for you.
- They catchin' up?

970
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,173
Yeah.

971
01:23:57,269 --> 01:23:59,763
How come you're here?
What you want with me?

972
01:24:03,216 --> 01:24:05,997
That woman told you wrong.

973
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,491
Why'd she do that?

974
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:14,725
She said if they caught you you'd squeal.

975
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:17,890
- What happened to your shoulder?
- Kid shot me.

976
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:24,316
If we hit high ground,
we can still make it. Come on.

977
01:24:24,508 --> 01:24:27,290
- Cullen, I can't make it.
- Come on!

978
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:29,879
Cullen, I can't make it!

979
01:24:29,975 --> 01:24:32,853
Come on, man, you draggin' on the chain.

980
01:24:48,486 --> 01:24:54,049
That dame.
Why would she do a thing like that?

981
01:24:54,433 --> 01:24:58,365
- She was just tryin' to help ya.
- She sure helped, all right.

982
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:01,434
Can't blame a body
for what they don't know.

983
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,504
I blame her.

984
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:06,901
I blame her, all right.

985
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:10,930
( rock'n'roll)

986
01:25:27,043 --> 01:25:28,194
Halt!

987
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:32,606
- Sweetheart picked up the scent, all right!
- They can't be far away.

988
01:25:32,893 --> 01:25:35,387
Solly, bring up the Dobermans.

989
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:44,978
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

990
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:48,815
- No dogs.
- Do we have to go all over that again?

991
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:51,021
No killer dogs, Frank!

992
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:54,090
Look, Max, we crossed
the county line this mornin'.

993
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:57,830
You're out of your jurisdiction.
Take off the muzzles, Solly.

994
01:25:58,118 --> 01:26:00,612
- Wait, Solly.
- You're wastin' time, Max.

995
01:26:00,804 --> 01:26:02,914
We're supposed to find 'em,
not execute 'em.

996
01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:05,983
I'm givin' the orders. Go ahead, Solly.

997
01:26:07,422 --> 01:26:11,546
Just a minute, Solly. If you make
one move, I'm goin' to shoot them.

998
01:26:12,217 --> 01:26:15,958
- For the love of Mike, Max!
- Are you gonna listen to me?

999
01:26:18,643 --> 01:26:20,849
Hold everythin', Solly.

1000
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,959
Come on, boy.

1001
01:26:23,823 --> 01:26:28,810
All right, I'll take those trackers. When
we close in, I'll go on ahead by myself.

1002
01:26:29,098 --> 01:26:31,496
If anythin' happens to me,
let the other dogs loose.

1003
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,181
- I don't like it.
- You don't have to.

1004
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:44,156
(train whistle)

1005
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,582
(train whistle)

1006
01:27:00,845 --> 01:27:03,722
(train approaching)

1007
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:59,926
Cullen... Cullen...

1008
01:28:01,077 --> 01:28:02,804
Come on, Joker.

1009
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:07,024
- Cullen...
- Run! Come on!

1010
01:28:07,695 --> 01:28:09,997
I can't make it! I can't make it!

1011
01:28:13,066 --> 01:28:14,121
Hold it, Joker.

1012
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,146
How you doin', Joker?

1013
01:29:05,338 --> 01:29:06,873
OK.

1014
01:29:09,462 --> 01:29:11,956
- You hurt bad?

Sure you do.

1016
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:27,590
You gonna make somebody
a fine old lady one day.

1017
01:29:29,604 --> 01:29:31,426
Ain't it the truth.

1018
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,948
(dogs barking)

1019
01:29:39,483 --> 01:29:41,401

1020
01:29:43,895 --> 01:29:45,717
Just rest easy, Joker.

1021
01:29:47,923 --> 01:29:49,841
- Cullen...

1022
01:29:51,088 --> 01:29:54,157

run for it, didn't we?

1023
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:55,979
Yeah.

1024
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:59,528

01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,558

1026
01:30:14,203 --> 01:30:16,696

1027
01:30:16,888 --> 01:30:18,806
So are you.

1029
01:30:23,027 --> 01:30:24,465
Yeah...

1030
01:30:32,906 --> 01:30:37,317

1031
01:30:40,674 --> 01:30:43,935

1034
01:30:58,226 --> 01:31:00,624

1035
01:31:02,926 --> 01:31:04,844
Look a-here what I got

1040
01:31:18,655 --> 01:31:21,725

1041
01:31:22,012 --> 01:31:23,835

1042
01:31:24,122 --> 01:31:26,232
