1
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,880
We want Pollitt. Brick Pollitt.

2
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
We want Pollitt.

3
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
Brick Pollitt.

4
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,160
Don't you do that!

5
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm warning you, Trixie.

6
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,320
Gooper!

7
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,720
Can't you stop your child
from putting her hands in the ice cream?

8
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,640
Couldn't you at least wash your hands
before you did that?

9
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,680
Maggie!

10
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,720
You stop that!

11
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,280
How could you do that to a child?

12
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Like this, honey.

13
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
Did you see what she did?

14
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I told her to wash her hands first.

15
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
One of those no-neck monsters
hit me with some ice cream.

16
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,120
Why do you call Gooper's kiddies
"no-neck monsters"?

17
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,160
Because your brother's children
have got no necks.

18
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,080
Their fat little heads sit on their fat bodies
without a bit of connection.

19
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,600
That's too bad.

20
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,440
Especially 'cause, if they have no necks
you can't wring them. Right, honey?

21
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,400
Here we are!

22
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Come on, Buster, Sonny.

23
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,400
Go get in the car. We're all going to go.

24
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,400
Did you ever hear so many dog's names
tagged on to children?

25
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,960
They've got five monsters
and number six coming up.

26
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,840
They've brought the whole bunch here
like animals to display at a county fair.

27
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,280
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.

28
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
It's obvious what they're up to.

29
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,880
What are they up to, Maggie?

30
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,240
I'll tell you what they're up to, boy of mine.

31
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,560
They're up to cutting you out
of your father's estate.

32
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,560
Everybody knows Big Daddy's...

33
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
...dying of....

34
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,720
I ought to send Sister Woman a bill
for a new pair of stockings.

35
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,360
Do we?

36
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,720
Do we what?

37
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Know that Big Daddy is dying of....

38
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't you believe it?

39
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,160
You'll know soon enough.

40
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,080
Suppose he is?

41
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
There's some things you've got to face.

42
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,320
There's some things in this world
you've simply got to face.

43
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,640
Why was Big Daddy in that horrible clinic
for six weeks...

44
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,960
...if the examination didn't show anything?

45
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,040
Why did Brother Man bring his whole tribe
down here in this sticky heat?

46
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,280
And why so many allusions
to you and Rainbow Hill?

47
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,640
You know what Rainbow Hill is?

48
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,360
It's a place that's famous for treating
famous alcoholics and dope fiends.

49
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm not famous.

50
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,640
No...

51
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
...and you don't take dope.

52
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,280
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate
for Rainbow Hill.

53
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,560
That's where Brother Man's
going to tell Big Daddy to ship you.

54
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
Over my dead body!

55
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
Rainbow Hill.

56
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,200
With you out of the way,
Gooper gets hold of the estate...

57
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,680
...signs the checks, and cuts off our credit
whenever he wants.

58
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,880
How'd you like that, baby?

59
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,920
You're doing just about everything...

60
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,640
...to aid and abet them
in grabbing control, after Big Daddy--

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
Well, you are.

62
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
Quitting work,
devoting yourself to drinking!

63
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,720
Breaking your ankle last night
on the high school field.

64
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,080
Brick?

65
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,520
We've got one thing on our side.

66
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,160
No, two things.

67
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,960
Are my seams straight?

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,800
He just can't stand Brother Man
and his wife...

70
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,160
...that fertility monster.
She's odious to him.

71
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,360
I can tell.

72
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,840
Just like I can tell he likes me.

73
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,800
That's the second thing
we've got on our side.

74
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,760
He likes me.

75
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,480
The way he looks me up and down,
and over....

76
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,360
He's still got an eye for girls.

77
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,560
That kind of talk is disgusting.

78
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,480
Anybody ever tell you
you were a back-aching Puritan?

79
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,040
I think it's mighty fine how that old fellow,
on death's doorstep...

80
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,520
...takes in my shape with what
I consider deserved appreciation.

81
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,560
Gooper still cherishes the illusion
he took a giant step up the social ladder...

82
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,040
...when he married Mae Flynn
of the no-neck Memphis Flynns...

83
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
...because she was queen
of the Cotton Carnival.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,720
I can just see Gooper
falling for Her Majesty...

85
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,920
...sitting on that brass throne,
riding that tacky float down Main Street...

86
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,800
...smiling and bowing, and blowing kisses
to all the trash on the street.

87
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,880
You know what happened to her?

88
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,720
No, what happened to her?

89
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,480
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.

90
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,160
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso
leaned out the window and said:

91
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
"Hey, Queenie!"

92
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,560
Sister Mae looked up and smiled
and waved...

93
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,880
...and that drunk shot a squirt
of tobacco juice...

94
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,000
...right in her face.

95
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

96
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,560
Like what?

97
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,840
Like you were just looking.

98
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
I wasn't conscious of looking at you.

99
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,400
I was conscious of it.

100
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,160
- If you were thinking the same thing--
- No, Maggie!

101
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,800
- Why not?
- Will you please keep your voice down?

102
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
No!

103
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
I know you better than you think.

104
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,440
I've seen that look before...

105
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,400
...and I know what it used to mean.

106
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,960
- And it still means the same thing now.
- You're not the same woman now, Maggie.

107
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,560
Don't you think I know that?

108
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,320
- Don't you think I know--
- Know what, Maggie?

109
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,760
That I've gone through
this horrible transformation.

110
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,080
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.

111
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,720
Are you planning on meeting
Big Daddy's plane?

112
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
I get so lonely.

113
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,800
Everybody gets that.

114
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,280
Living with somebody you love can be...

115
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,200
...lonelier than living entirely alone...

116
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,400
...when the one you love doesn't love you.

117
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,160
You can't even stand
drinking out of the same glass, can you?

118
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
Would you like to live alone?

119
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,800
No!

120
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
No, I wouldn't.

121
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,200
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?

122
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Most drinking men lose theirs.

123
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,120
Why can't you?

124
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,760
I think you've even got better looking
since you went on the bottle.

125
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,640
You were such a wonderful lover.

126
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,480
You'll be late!

127
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
You were so exciting to be in love with.

128
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,600
Mostly, I guess, because you were....

129
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,800
If I thought you'd...

130
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,840
...never make love to me again...

131
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,440
...I'd find the longest, sharpest knife
and stick it straight into my heart.

132
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
I'd do that.

133
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,640
How long does this have to go on,
this punishment?

134
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,520
Haven't I served my term?
Can I get a pardon?

135
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Your finishing-school voice sounds like
you were running upstairs to say, "Fire!"

136
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,880
Is it any wonder?

137
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,680
You know what I feel like?

138
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,440
I feel all the time like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

139
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.

140
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,880
Cats jump off roofs and land uninjured.
Do it. Jump.

141
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,000
Jump where?

142
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,560
Into what?

143
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,320
Take a lover.

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,480
I don't deserve that!

145
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
I can't see any man but you.

146
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,880
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,840
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?

148
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,880
Why can't you get fat or ugly or something,
so I can stand it?

149
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,400
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.

150
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,560
I'm more determined than you think.

151
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,560
I'll win all right.

152
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,080
Win what?

153
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,720
What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

154
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,280
Just staying on it, I guess...

155
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
...as long as she can.

156
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,760
Calm down. Not yet. Now wait a minute.

157
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
Where are the flowers?

158
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
Aren't you putting it on a little thick?

159
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,040
Get ready, now!

160
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,800
Mama, she didn't bring anything
for Big Daddy.

161
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,400
Pretty seedy looking flowers
for Big Daddy, huh, Gooper?

162
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,840
I picked them myself.

163
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
Looks like she picked them off a grave.

164
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,200
Don't talk about graves when we don't
know if Big Daddy's going to live or die.

165
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,800
Get ready.

166
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
Hello, Mae.

167
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Hello, children.

168
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,200
Doc, isn't it great?

169
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,960
Kiss me!

170
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,120
Kiss your grandmother.

171
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
Darling Big Daddy!

172
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,680
You look fine, Big Daddy.

173
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,400
Doc, do you want to tell them the news?

174
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,240
The exploratory operation proved
there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy.

175
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,560
Nothing at all!

176
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,480
Just a spastic colon. And that's all.

177
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,640
- Great news!
- Isn't that great news?

178
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,400
That's the best birthday present of all.

179
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,920
Where's Brick?

180
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,240
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg.

181
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,800
- How?
- What's that?

182
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,880
Got drunk again and tried to jump
the high hurdles at 3:00 a.m.

183
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,280
That poor boy still thinks he's an athlete.

184
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,360
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper.

185
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
AP got hold of it too.

186
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,520
Yeah, and UP...

187
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,400
...and thanks to your professional
legal advice, every other P.

188
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
Let's go home.

189
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,360
Don't you want to ride with the children?

190
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,840
No!

191
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,840
He's his sassy old self again, all right!

192
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,720
Be quiet, woman!

193
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
Hush up!

194
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,680
Welcome home, Cap'n Pollitt.

195
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm going to live, Maggie. I'm going to live.

196
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,120
They had me real scared.

197
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,040
I've wasted so much time.

198
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,160
I've got a million different kinds
of feelings left in me.

199
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,960
And I'm going to use them.
I'm going to use them all.

200
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,240
Why did you and Brick
suddenly drive up from New Orleans?

201
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,280
For your birthday, what else?

202
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,600
I had one last year and the year before.
Didn't see you then.

203
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,880
You know how Brick is sometimes.

204
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,760
Maybe he thought he was coming
to my funeral instead.

205
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,920
Brick loves you! He does!

206
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,480
But does he love you?

207
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,280
What do you want? Proof?

208
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,800
If I was married to you three years...

209
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
...you'd have the living proof.

210
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,560
You'd have three kids
and a fourth in the oven.

211
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,040
Get me out of this. I want to talk to Brick.

212
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,360
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.

213
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,280
"We love you when we're with you

214
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,240
"And we love you out of sight

215
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,800
"Big Mama, too"

216
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,640
I've got news, honey!

217
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,240
Big news.

218
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,520
Big Daddy's going to live.

219
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,240
That's right, he's a well man.

220
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
That's what Big Mama said and Dr. Baugh
was right there with them.

221
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,680
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.

222
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,640
They almost dropped dead
from shock themselves.

223
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,720
He's all right?

224
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
Feeling like 40...

225
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,880
...and talking like 20.

226
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
And we can drive back
to New Orleans tonight.

227
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,080
- I'm taking no chances on moving you.
- I won't break.

228
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,800
Or letting them poison
Big Daddy's mind against you.

229
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,400
I just want you to get dressed
and come to Big Daddy's birthday party.

230
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,880
First thing Big Daddy asked about was you.

231
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
Big Daddy! Now what makes him so big?

232
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,600
His big heart, his big belly...

233
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,040
...or his big money?

234
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
The heat has made you cross.

235
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,200
Give me my crutch.

236
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,040
Why don't you put on
your silk pajamas, honey...

237
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,160
...and come on down to the party?

238
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,560
There's a lovely cool breeze.

239
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
Give me my crutch, Maggie.

240
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,360
Lean on me, baby.

241
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,480
You've got a nice smell about you.

242
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
- Was your bathwater cool?
- No.

243
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
I know something
that would make you cool and fresh.

244
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
Alcohol rub.

245
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,000
Cologne.

246
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,280
No thanks. We'd smell alike.

247
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,840
Like a couple of cats in the heat.

248
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
It's cool on the lawn.

249
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,600
I am not going down there.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy!

250
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,240
At least give him this present...

251
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,840
...that I remembered to buy for you,
for his birthday.

252
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
Just write a few words on this card.

253
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,960
You write something.

254
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,600
It's got to be your handwriting.
It's your present.

255
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,160
I didn't get him a present.

256
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,600
What's the difference?

257
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,880
If there's no difference, you write the card!

258
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,800
- And have him know you didn't remember?
- I didn't remember!

259
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,920
You don't have to prove it to him!

260
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
Just write, "Love, Brick"...

261
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560
...for heaven's sake!

262
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,600
- You've got to.
- I don't have to do anything!

263
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,920
You forget the conditions I agreed on
to stay living with you!

264
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,960
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all!

265
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,280
That's the first time you've raised
your voice in a long time.

266
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
A crack in the stone wall?

267
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,920
I think that's a fine sign. Mighty fine.

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,600
What did you do that for?

269
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,040
To give us a little privacy for a while.

270
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,960
Don't make a fool of yourself.

271
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
I don't mind making a fool
of myself over you.

272
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.

273
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
Feel embarrassed!

274
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
I can't live on this way.

275
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,960
- You agreed to accept that condition!
- I know I did, but I can't!

276
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,320
Let go.

277
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,200
Let go, Maggie!

278
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,640
Son!

279
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,920
We've got the most wonderful news
about Big Daddy!

280
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,840
What's this door doing locked?

281
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
You think there's robbers in the house?

282
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,240
Brick's getting dressed, Big Mama.

283
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
He's still getting dressed.

284
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,840
It won't be the first time
I've seen Brick not dressed.

285
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,320
Open this door.

286
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
Brick, honey!

287
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,280
Sweetheart, how does your leg feel?

288
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,520
Come out of there. I want to give you
the news about Big Daddy.

289
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,720
I told him already.

290
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,840
I just hate locked doors in the house.

291
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,480
I know you do
but people need privacy, don't they?

292
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,760
No, ma'am, not in my house.

293
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,200
What did you take this off for?
It looked so sweet on you.

294
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,760
Not sweet enough
for Big Daddy's birthday party.

295
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Out!

296
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,800
Out, you little monster!

297
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,360
Mae and Gooper are so touchy
about their children.

298
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,320
You hardly even dare suggest
there's any room for improvement.

299
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Brick, hurry on out!

300
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
Shoot, Maggie, you just don't like children.

301
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,680
Why that's not true. I adore them.

302
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,000
Well brought up.

303
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,480
Why not have some, then,
and bring them up well?

304
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
- Instead of picking on theirs?
- Big Mama!

305
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,480
Hugh and Betsy have got to go.
They're waiting to say goodbye.

306
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,240
I'll be right down.
Tell them to hold their horses.

307
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,680
Where's Brick?

308
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,760
What you said about having children....

309
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,920
It's still kind of a secret, but--

310
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,320
Shoot, Maggie! Stop playing so dumb.

311
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,600
Is he still drinking this stuff much?

312
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,040
- He may have had a little highball.
- Don't laugh about it.

313
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,160
Some men stop drinking when they marry.
Others start.

314
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
- He never drank before--
- That's not fair!

315
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,880
Fair or not, I want to ask you a question.

316
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,920
Do you make Brick happy?

317
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,360
Well?

318
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,240
- Why don't you ask if he makes me happy?
- I know--

319
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,320
It works both ways.

320
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,640
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.

321
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,520
- We're leaving, Big Mama.
- I'm coming!

322
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
When a marriage goes on the rocks...

323
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,600
...the rocks are there, right there!

324
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,080
Goodbye, Ida.

325
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,880
I'm coming.

326
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,760
That's not fair.

327
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,960
All right, I'm coming.

328
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,200
Is Brick here?

329
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,160
I thought I'd check his ankle.

330
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,080
Is it giving him much pain?

331
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,600
You know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.

332
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,360
Even when he had
that awful back injury in football.

333
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,640
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.

334
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,240
I think they're fixing
to sit down at the table.

335
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,680
You forgot to write out the card, honey.

336
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Thanks, Doc.

337
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,160
Can I get you something cool?

338
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
No, thanks.

339
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,040
How's the ankle?

340
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,280
Itches some.

341
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,560
Funny, that's the same leg
you tore a muscle in the....

342
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
'Bama State.

343
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,840
Twenty-one to--

344
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,720
Nothing.

345
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,080
You miss football, don't you?

346
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,120
Hurt much when you put weight on it?

347
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,240
Some.

348
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,920
Yeah, you were quite a team,
you and Skipper.

349
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,880
What is it, Doc?

350
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,520
You didn't leave that party
to come up and discuss my health.

351
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,640
That's right.

352
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,160
- I've already heard the good news--
- It's bad news.

353
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,040
It's what we expected.

354
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,520
It's malignant and it's terminal.

355
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,600
He hasn't a chance.

356
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,760
- But Maggie said, and Big Mama--
- Lies.

357
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,520
I lied to them.

358
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,680
I lied to him, too.

359
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,920
Professional ethics.

360
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,120
Gooper?

361
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,880
I told him the truth
coming in from the airfield.

362
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,600
He's going to die.

363
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,920
He's going to die.

364
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,480
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam"

365
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,400
What kind of truth is that?

366
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,920
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

367
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,560
"To shine for him each day

368
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
"In every way try to please him

369
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,640
"At home, at school, at play

370
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,880
"A sunbeam

371
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,840
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

372
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,920
"A sunbeam, a sunbeam

373
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,080
"I'll be a sunbeam for him"

374
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,680
Amen!

375
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
- Did you like the singing, Big Daddy?
- Pass the black-eyed peas.

376
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,040
Look at Big Daddy eat!
Ain't it something to thank your stars for?

377
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,040
They've been practicing just for you.

378
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,320
Tell them to sit and eat.

379
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,280
- Children, come on.
- Over there!

380
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,400
Yeah. Over there.

381
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
Look here. Telegrams!

382
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,600
Hundreds of them from every corner
of this great state--

383
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,960
Wishing you happy birthday.

384
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,680
Do you want me to read them?

385
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
One from the governor and the senator--

386
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,000
It must be getting on to election time,
hey, Deacon?

387
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,760
Let's remember,
we're all Iambs in the same pasture.

388
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,720
Everybody, including Big Daddy,
owes thanks to those in high places who--

389
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,000
Gave us nothing!

390
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,040
Every scrap on this table was raised
right here on this place, Deacon.

391
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,440
I made a pastureland out of this place
when it was nothing but a swamp.

392
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,720
And it was done with the help of God,
and not any governor.

393
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,680
Amen.

394
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
"Boom, boom and it makes me crazy"

395
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,320
Great balls of fire!

396
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,680
Surprise!

397
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,800
- What are they up to now?
- It's part of the entertainment.

398
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,800
Don't they get any intermission?

399
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
That's funny!

400
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,320
That's very funny!

401
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,680
He don't mean it, Sister Woman.

402
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,320
- He loves children!
- Of course he does!

403
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,440
Will you put some honey on this?

404
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,640
They're all Pollitts,
I'm proud to say, every one of them.

405
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,440
I know Big Daddy's
just as proud as we are...

406
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,760
...that there's a flesh-and-blood dynasty...

407
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,080
...waiting to take over.

408
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
That's no way to talk.

409
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,280
What way?

410
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,360
"Take over." When we all know...

411
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,920
...Big Daddy's going to live
to be at least 100.

412
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,560
I'll drink to that!

413
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,000
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!

414
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,840
To Big Daddy!

415
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,840
In the name of every person
in this county...

416
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,320
...in the name of the church
and school board, the board of trustees...

417
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,480
...felicitations on your 65th birthday.

418
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,840
Brick, honey,
I brought you something to eat.

419
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,520
I'm not hungry.

420
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,840
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,920
We're leaving.

422
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,840
- We can't.
- I can.

423
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,560
- The party's coming up here to you.
- I'll get one of the boys to drive me.

424
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,400
You just can't walk out
on Big Daddy's birthday party!

425
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,240
Don't you care nothing about him?

426
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,720
Get out of my way.

427
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,120
Get out of my way, Maggie!

428
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
You've got no cause to dislike him.

429
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,960
Do I dislike him?

430
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,040
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.

431
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,600
What's he ever done to you?

432
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
What?

433
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,160
Why do you hate him so much?

434
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,880
What's he ever done to you?

435
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,360
Nothing.

436
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,320
What was Dr. Baugh doing up here?

437
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,320
What did he--

438
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
That's right. Big Daddy is going to die.

439
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,320
I don't believe that.

440
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,600
Dr. Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.

441
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,080
Wouldn't he, Maggie?

442
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,680
Poor Big Daddy.

443
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm fond of him.

444
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,440
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.

445
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,600
I really am, you know.

446
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,080
When he finds out....

447
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,400
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.

448
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,160
That's why you want to go now.

449
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,200
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.

450
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,920
You've got to do this for me, Maggie.

451
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,440
And leave the field to Gooper and his wife?

452
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,560
No, sir!

453
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,280
Let's face facts, baby.

454
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,160
You're a drinker. That takes money.

455
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,640
I don't want his money!

456
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,760
Are you ready to settle for ten-cent beer?

457
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,880
That's what Gooper'll dole out to you
when they freeze you out.

458
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,240
They've got a plan, baby.

459
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,760
You should've heard them
laying it on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute!

460
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,400
Big Mama's already on their side.

461
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,880
You're a drinker and I'm childless.

462
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,000
We've got to beat that plan,
we've just got to!

463
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,400
I've been so...

464
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,600
...disgustingly poor all my life.

465
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,400
That's the truth, Brick.

466
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,360
Have you, Maggie?

467
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
You don't know what it's like to have to...

468
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,560
...suck up to people you can't stand,
just because they have money.

469
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,680
You don't know what it's like...

470
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,920
...never having any clothes.

471
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,960
That dress I married you in...

472
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,080
...was a hand-me-down
from a snotty, rich cousin I hated.

473
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,360
You can be young without money.

474
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,720
But you can't be old without it.

475
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,240
Where did I fail you?

476
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,040
Where did I make my mistake?

477
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,760
Make that your last drink
until after the party...

478
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,280
...please, honey.

479
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,960
I think I made my mistake
when I tried to tell you about Skipper.

480
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,080
That's my fatal error.

481
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,400
- I never should--
- Shut up about Skipper!

482
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,400
I mean it! Shut up!

483
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,160
The laws of silence won't work about that!

484
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,200
Not about Skipper and us.

485
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,120
It's like locking the door on a fire
to forget the house is burning.

486
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,760
Hey, everybody!

487
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,880
But not looking at a fire doesn't put it out.

488
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,760
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper--

489
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
I don't want to hear about it!

490
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
Why won't you face the truth, just once...

491
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,400
...about Skipper, about me, about yourself?

492
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Are you bringing that party up here or not?

493
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,160
Kit and caboodle, son.

494
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,120
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this...

495
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,120
...and I don't care if it's in front of them.

496
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,680
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?

497
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Are you still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

498
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,440
I could kill you with this crutch.

499
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,800
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?

500
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,840
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Why won't you let it alone?

501
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,160
- It's got to be told!
- I don't want to hear it!

502
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,600
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you...

503
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,440
...and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!

504
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,160
Skipper was no good!

505
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,720
Maybe I'm no good.

506
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,080
Nobody's good.

507
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,560
But Skipper is dead!

508
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,680
And I'm alive!

509
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,720
Maggie the cat is alive!

510
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm alive!

511
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,360
Why are you afraid of the truth?

512
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Truth?

513
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,680
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you...

514
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,560
...to knock before you open a door.

515
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Otherwise, people might think
you're lacking in good breeding.

516
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,480
What's Uncle Brick doing on the floor?

517
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,720
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie...

518
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,200
...but I failed...

519
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,760
...and I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

520
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,600
What were you jumping high hurdles for?

521
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,760
Because I used to, and people like to do
what they used to do...

522
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,040
...after they've stopped being able to do it.

523
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,480
That's right. And that's your answer.

524
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
Now go away.

525
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,360
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

526
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,800
You're just jealous
because you can't have babies.

527
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
You see?

528
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,080
Mae and Gooper gloat over us
being childless...

529
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,680
...even in front of their little
no-neck monsters.

530
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,600
I went to a doctor in Memphis.

531
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,040
A gynecologist.

532
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,720
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child...

533
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,840
...whenever we want.

534
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,000
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

535
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,640
But how in hell do you imagine
you're going to have a child...

536
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,320
...by a man who cannot stand you?

537
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,120
That, boy of mine...

538
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,680
...is a problem I'll just have to work out.

539
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
Here comes that party, here we come!

540
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,280
Here comes that birthday party!

541
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,120
That's nice.

542
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,160
The preacher almost cried when I told him
I got a stained-glass memorial window.

543
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,160
Who gave you that window, Deacon?

544
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,080
Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a generous woman of fine character.

545
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,920
What someone should give our church
is a cooling system.

546
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
Yes, sir. Exactly my thought.

547
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,880
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots...

548
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,520
...diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

549
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,000
Gooper, what have all the kiddies
been shot for?

550
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,280
Everything but stealing chickens.

551
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Well, Brick?

552
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,480
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

553
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,360
- Bull!
- Guess what memorial Gus's family gave?

554
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,040
- A new house and basketball court--
- Deacon!

555
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,040
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

556
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,000
Figuring on somebody kicking off
around here?

557
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,840
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

558
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,560
Turn that damn thing off!

559
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,560
Where's my Brick?

560
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.

561
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,160
How does your leg feel, honey?

562
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,720
Your hand was made for holding
something better! Put that liquor down.

563
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,440
- He is putting it down, all right!
- Turn that off!

564
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,840
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

565
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,080
Hey, everybody, you know the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

566
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,160
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

567
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper...

568
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,000
...and Big Daddy said,
"That's my kid, ain't it?"

569
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,440
It was kind of funny.
I'd never had a beau...

570
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,240
...till I met your father.
He said, "I want that kid.

571
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,680
"I need him.

572
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,080
"He ain't going to have nobody else's name
but mine. Let's get the preacher.

573
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,680
"That's what marriage is for. Family."

574
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,480
Children were mighty important
to Big Daddy, even then.

575
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,440
Ida, will you stop that yammering?

576
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,920
That's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

577
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,760
I've been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

578
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,040
Ida, will you keep quiet?

579
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,560
Children, come on!

580
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!

581
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,720
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

582
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,240
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

583
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
"And so is Big Mama, too

584
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,400
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

585
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,720
"And so is Big Mama, too"

586
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,880
- Ida, what the hell's the matter with you?
- She's just so happy.

587
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm so happy.
I've just got to cry or something.

588
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,000
Big Daddy's 100 percent...

589
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,280
...healthy!

590
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,760
Aren't you going to give Big Daddy
his birthday present?

591
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,480
- You can open up your birthday present.
- You open it. I want to talk to Brick.

592
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,160
Brick, come over here.

593
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,840
Big Daddy's calling you.

594
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,640
Big Mama, take them out for me.

595
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,480
- It's a cashmere robe!
- You sound surprised.

596
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,840
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny!

597
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,080
What's so funny about it?

598
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,760
All my family ever had was family.

599
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,840
Quiet!

600
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,160
- You bought it yourself last Saturday.
- I said quiet!

601
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,440
The salesgirl that sold it to you
waited on me and she told me about it.

602
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,360
- Sister Woman!
- Quiet!

603
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,920
- Stork and the Grim Reaper, neck and neck.
- Deacon!

604
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,040
Deacon!

605
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,360
I'm not butting in on more talk about
memorial stained-glass windows, am I?

606
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,320
Not at all.

607
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,960
What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

608
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
I love humanity. That's my reward.

609
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,880
And if humanity returns your love,
you might get elected...

610
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,920
...councilman or mayor, hey, Deacon?

611
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,800
Don't start picking on Deacon.

612
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,280
- That's all right. I was--
- Good night, Deacon.

613
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,240
That's exactly what I was about to say.
I better go before it starts raining.

614
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,920
Good night, everybody.
Bless each and every one in this place.

615
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,320
They tell me you were indulging in
some athletics last night.

616
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,560
- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

617
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,760
What were you doing on the high school
athletic field at 3:00 in the morning?

618
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,640
I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.

619
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
Because you were drunk!

620
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,560
Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

621
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,080
It's time to blow out the candles!

622
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,920
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt...

623
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,880
...on his 65th birthday.

624
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,880
- To the biggest cotton planter--
- I told you, quit this bull!

625
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,800
I won't let you talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

626
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,240
I'll talk like I want to on my birthday,
or any other rotten day.

627
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,120
Anybody don't like it,
they know what they can do about it.

628
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,200
- I know you don't mean that.
- You don't know nothing, never did.

629
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,800
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.

630
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,000
I've put up with a lot of bull around here
because I thought I was dying.

631
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,520
That's when you started taking over.

632
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,920
Your loud voice and busybody butting in
here and there and everywhere.

633
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,800
Sashaying around here,
making a big noise like a boss.

634
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm the only boss around here.

635
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,720
I built this place with no help from you.

636
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,760
And I'll run this place till the day I die.

637
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,440
Is that plain to you, Ida?
Is that perfectly clear to you?

638
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,800
I ain't going to die.

639
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,400
Ain't nothing wrong with me
but a spastic colon!

640
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,840
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars...

641
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,320
...I've had to put up with around here.

642
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,000
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with
these 40 years I've lived with you.

643
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,960
Now blow out them candles.

644
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,920
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

645
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,960
In all these years
you never believed I loved you.

646
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,080
And I did.

647
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,280
I did so much.

648
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,920
I did love you.

649
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,200
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

650
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,280
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- If he should die before--

651
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,280
Excuse me.

652
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,600
Son!

653
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,360
I was calling Brick.

654
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,880
I was just delivering him to you.

655
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,160
- What did you do that for?
- Do what?

656
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,960
Wipe off her kiss?

657
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,440
Did I?

658
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,760
Your woman's got a better shape on her...

659
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,440
...than Gooper's got on his.

660
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,200
- Is that the only difference you've noticed?
- Difference in shape is pretty important.

661
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,040
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?

662
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,160
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

663
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,400
They're a couple of cats...

664
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,680
...sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres
of land. That's a lot of land.

665
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,360
They're both squaring off, determined
to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.

666
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,960
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise
for them babies.

667
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,440
I ain't letting go for a long time yet,
if they're waiting for that.

668
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,240
You just sit tight and let them
scratch each other's eyes out.

669
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,800
You bet your life.

670
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,960
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

671
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,560
Five head of them already
and more coming.

672
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
6-0. She'll probably drop a litter next time.

673
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,120
- Are you stuck out there?
- I was just passing by.

674
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,000
You were just sneaking and spying.

675
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,840
Do I have to lock all the doors around here
to have a private conversation?

676
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,960
- Why hurt those that really love you?
- Bull!

677
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,560
I'm going to move you and Gooper
out of that room.

678
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,160
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

679
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,920
I hate sneaking and spying!
It makes me puke!

680
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,120
They listen, do they?

681
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,120
Yeah, they listen.

682
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,000
They run and tell Big Mama
everything they hear.

683
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,760
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?

684
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,840
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!

685
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,680
- What are you doing now?
- Freshening up my drink.

686
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,400
- You know you've a real liquor problem?
- Yes, sir.

687
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,240
- Is that why you quit sports announcing?
- I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

688
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,360
Don't guess!

689
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,440
It's too important!

690
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,560
So you quit.

691
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,080
- Some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?

692
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,840
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

693
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,560
Do you think a shot of that whisky
would injure my spastic condition?

694
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,920
No, sir.

695
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,960
It might do it some good.

696
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,200
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!

697
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,160
That's the way to feel.

698
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,960
I can breathe.

699
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,960
All my life I've been like a doubled-up fist...

700
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,880
...pounding and smashing and driving!

701
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,200
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

702
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,400
Do you know what I'm thinking?

703
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,920
What's that, sir?

704
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,320
Pleasure!

705
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,960
I'll tell you, I still have a feeling for women,
and I'm 65.

706
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,520
- That's mighty remarkable.
- Remarkable?

707
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,080
Admirable.

708
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,480
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

709
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,600
- I'm going to have me a ball.
- A ball?

710
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,520
I'm going to pick me a choice woman...

711
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,320
...and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

712
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,240
I'm going to be happy!

713
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,320
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

714
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,880
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

715
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,000
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?

716
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,600
- A click in my head.
- Did you say, "click"?

717
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,480
Yes, sir. That click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

718
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,760
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

719
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,640
Like a switch clicking off in my head.
Turns the hot light off and the cool one on.

720
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,520
All of a sudden, there's peace.

721
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,040
You're a real alcoholic!

722
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,680
That is the truth.

723
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,080
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

724
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
- No, I won't!
- I'm waiting for that click...

725
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,240
...and I don't get it unless I'm alone!
I'm not talking. When it's quiet!

726
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,760
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.

727
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,280
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

728
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,560
- Let it be painful.
- I can crawl and hop if I have to.

729
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,560
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out
this family and be drinking on skid row.

730
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,240
Yeah, that will come too.

731
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,640
No. Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm going to straighten you out.

732
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,080
Sit down!

733
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,040
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

734
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,360
- Where are you going?
- To get another bottle.

735
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,880
No, you're not, you drunken whelp!

736
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,400
- Why are you shouting? I can't stand it!
- Get out of here!

737
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,120
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?

738
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,360
You had better know why you drink
or give it up!

739
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,200
Give me my crutch.

740
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,200
Why do you drink?

741
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,320
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.

742
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,760
Good!

743
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,600
At least you're not too numb...

744
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,280
...with liquor to feel pain.

745
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
- Why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.

746
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,560
- Tell me first.
- No, give me a drink first.

747
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,320
- First you've got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!

748
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,520
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.

749
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,160
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

750
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,200
What are you disgusted with?

751
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,120
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!

752
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,480
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?

753
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,920
No, not one lie or one person.
The whole thing.

754
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,880
- You got a headache?
- No, I'm trying--

755
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,800
Trying to concentrate, but you can't
because your brain is soaked with liquor.

756
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,080
Wet brain!

757
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,400
Mendacity!

758
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,360
What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.

759
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,800
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her!

760
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,440
Get out of there!

761
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,440
Go on. Close the door after you.

762
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,480
Mendacity!

763
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,560
Look at the lies I've got to put up with.
Pretenses, hypocrisy!

764
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,040
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.

765
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,320
Church! It bores me, but I go.

766
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,880
All those swindling lodges, social clubs,
and money-grabbing auxiliaries...

767
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,440
...that's got me on their number one
sucker list.

768
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,640
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?

769
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,520
You've got to. There's nothing to live with
but mendacity. Is there?

770
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,600
Yes, sir, you can live with this.

771
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,480
That's not living.

772
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,920
- That's dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.

773
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,520
Then why not kill yourself?

774
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,960
Because I like to drink.

775
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,880
I can't talk to you!

776
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,840
I'm sorry.

777
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,080
Do you expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land...

778
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,280
...this side of the Nile to a drunk fool?

779
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,080
No, sir.

780
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,040
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior?

781
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,400
Give it to Gooper and Mae.

782
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,320
I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

783
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,280
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!

784
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,600
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

785
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,640
I can wait and see
if you pull yourself together or not.

786
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,520
That's right.

787
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,040
- I'm not kidding.
- No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

788
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,880
You don't care?

789
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,040
No, sir, I don't care.

790
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,840
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.

791
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,800
- Now wait a minute!
- Or I'll drive myself.

792
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,880
I'm going home tonight. Now!

793
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,800
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?

794
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,840
Let's not leave it like this.

795
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,560
Like all them other talks we've had.

796
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,040
We always seem to talk around things.

797
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,000
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

798
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,680
- Now we've got to talk straight.
- It's too late for talk.

799
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,960
Why?

800
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,960
What are you disgusted about?

801
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,120
Because you can't play football anymore?

802
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,680
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!

803
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,960
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

804
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,480
Describing what I can't do
while others do it?

805
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,200
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can
stand it? You'll get that back for me?

806
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,680
I think you're passing the buck.

807
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,800
Do you know many drinking men?

808
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,480
I've known a good number.

809
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,760
Could any of them they tell you
why they drank?

810
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,480
You're passing the buck?

811
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,360
You're passing the buck
to things like disgust and mendacity.

812
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,640
If you've got to use that kind of language...

813
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,840
...it's 90 proof bull and I ain't buying any!

814
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,960
You started drinking with your friend
Skipper's death. Ain't that the truth?

815
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,960
What are you suggesting?

816
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,960
Nothing. But--

817
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,400
But what?

818
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Say your mind.

819
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,960
Say it!

820
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,880
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead, say it!

821
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,480
Why are you shouting like that?

822
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,520
Skipper and I were friends, understand?

823
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,120
Gooper said that Skipper was--

824
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,040
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

825
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,720
And you drag it through the gutter!

826
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,320
- Just a minute!
- You make it shameful and filthy!

827
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,120
Give me your hand.

828
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,000
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!

829
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,160
Didn't you ever look up to anybody?

830
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,040
Anybody at all in your whole life?

831
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,960
Didn't you ever believe in anything,
anybody?

832
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,000
No, sir, I guess you didn't.

833
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,440
Nothing and nobody
except Big Daddy himself.

834
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,640
You and Skipper played football together.

835
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,280
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

836
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,720
I could depend on him.

837
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,760
- On the football field!
- Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!

838
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,480
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

839
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,040
Bull!

840
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,560
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

841
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,720
Why did Skipper crack up?

842
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,520
All right.

843
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,200
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

844
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,560
That straight, true talk.

845
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,240
It's too late to stop now.

846
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,880
Can you say it without a drink?

847
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,520
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.

848
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,720
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.

849
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,720
What else do you need?

850
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,480
Skipper?

851
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,440
- He was a crutch for you too, wasn't he?
- Yes, sir.

852
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,120
I could lean on him, in school and out of it.

853
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,480
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

854
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,040
Ask her.

855
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,160
I'm asking you.

856
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,720
If you want to know why Skipper
cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.

857
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,680
What did she do?

858
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,600
Chase him out of the window
of that Chicago hotel?

859
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,240
Did that little bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

860
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,920
Why?

861
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,080
What went on
between Skipper and Maggie?

862
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,360
Ask her.

863
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,600
Maggie, come here.

864
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,480
Can I be of assistance, Big Daddy?

865
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,360
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you!

866
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,720
Go ahead, play.

867
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,320
What was going on
between you and Skipper?

868
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,160
Well, you see, Big Daddy....

869
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,240
Well?

870
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,240
Come on, Maggie!

871
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,480
You wanted to talk truth upstairs.

872
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,080
Go ahead!

873
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,800
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

874
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,600
Skipper didn't like me.

875
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,760
Why didn't Skipper like you?

876
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,520
- You know he was against our marriage.
- Why?

877
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,320
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what?

878
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,920
Freedom to run from town to town.

879
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,280
Planes, trains, always running!

880
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,560
- Football practice, dirty stories--
- Nobody forced you to come along with us!

881
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,680
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

882
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,160
Since when did a man's smell
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

883
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,800
Football, baby!

884
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,280
The idea of football smelled.

885
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,280
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

886
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,640
He didn't need any team of his own.

887
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,200
He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.

888
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,600
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

889
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,160
- You're a liar!
- He wasn't good enough on his own.

890
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,600
Professional football is a business...

891
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
...not a social club!

892
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,440
You mean the business of making money?

893
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,120
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

894
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,280
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!

895
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,760
Not from the first day to the last.

896
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,000
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

897
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,600
He lapped them up.

898
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,280
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

899
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,200
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

900
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,600
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

901
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,520
By the man I worshiped.

902
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,000
That's why I hated Skipper.

903
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,240
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

904
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,440
Is that true?

905
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,560
You don't think I ravished a football hero?

906
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,280
Skipper was drunk.

907
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,640
So are you most of the time.

908
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,480
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

909
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,560
Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

910
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,240
- You know what happened.
- I don't know!

911
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,200
I wasn't there.

912
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,160
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

913
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,320
- I was in the hospital--
- Skipper played.

914
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,760
He played all right!

915
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,080
His first professional game without Brick.

916
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,120
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

917
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,760
Go on, tell him.

918
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,800
You're a sports announcer.

919
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,160
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

920
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,160
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

921
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,800
...and stumbled and fell apart.

922
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,000
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

923
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,560
And it was all over:

924
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,640
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.

925
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,400
Bad breaks. An off day.

926
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,560
No, baby.

927
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,680
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

928
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,920
Outside: big, tough, confident.

929
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,920
Inside: pure jelly!

930
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,320
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

931
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,120
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

932
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,040
That little episode was not on TV.

933
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,320
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

934
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,840
He was sick.

935
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,640
Sick with drink.

936
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,080
He wouldn't come out.

937
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,480
He'd busted some furniture...

938
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,200
...and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

939
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,640
So I went to his room.

940
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,520
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

941
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,040
He was half crazy.

942
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,840
Violent and screaming one minute...

943
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,240
...weak and crying the next.

944
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,800
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

945
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,320
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

946
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,120
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

947
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,640
I thought he'd hit me.

948
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,520
He walked toward me...

949
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,640
...with a funny sort of smile on his face.

950
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,480
Then he did the strangest thing.

951
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,560
He kissed me.

952
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,680
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

953
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,160
And then I knew what I was going to do.

954
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,240
I'd get rid of Skipper.

955
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,040
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

956
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,080
I'd prove it by showing...

957
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,720
...that Skipper would make love
to his best friend's wife.

958
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,000
He didn't need any coaxing.

959
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,080
He was more than willing.

960
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,480
He even seemed to have the same idea.

961
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,320
You're just trying to whitewash it.

962
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,640
I'm not!

963
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,600
I was trying to win back my husband.

964
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,680
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

965
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,760
Even that.

966
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,400
But at the last second...

967
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,240
...I got panicky.

968
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,840
Supposing I lost you instead?

969
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,560
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

970
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,240
So I ran.

971
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,280
Nothing happened!

972
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,320
I've tried to tell him a hundred times
but he won't let me.

973
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,120
Nothing happened!

974
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,440
Hallelujah, St. Maggie.

975
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,520
I wanted to get rid of Skipper.

976
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,040
But not if it meant losing you.

977
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,480
He blames me for Skipper's death.

978
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,200
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.

979
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Skipper won out anyway.

980
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,880
I didn't get rid of him at all.

981
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,840
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?

982
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,760
I lost you anyway.

983
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,800
- You didn't talk to him again before he--
- No.

984
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,760
- But Brick did.
- How do you know?

985
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,640
- Skipper told me.
- When?

986
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,400
When they put his broken body
in the ambulance.

987
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,480
I rode with him to the hospital.

988
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,720
He kept saying,
"Why did Brick hang up on me?"

989
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,800
Why, Brick?

990
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,840
- Where are you going?
- Home.

991
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,320
- You can't drive. You're drunk.
- Not yet, Big Daddy.

992
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,200
Not yet. Now, give me that bottle.

993
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,880
What are you running away from?

994
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,240
Why did you hang up on Skipper
when he called you?

995
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,880
Answer me!

996
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,520
What did he say?
Was it about him and Maggie?

997
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,920
- He said they'd made love.
- And you believed him?

998
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,160
Yes.

999
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,760
Then why haven't you thrown her out?

1000
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,960
Something's missing here.
Why did Skipper kill himself?

1001
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,280
Because somebody let him down.

1002
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,920
I let him down.

1003
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,840
When he called that night...

1004
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,960
...I couldn't make sense out of....

1005
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,080
But there was one thing that was sure.

1006
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,480
Skipper was scared.

1007
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,600
Scared...

1008
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,600
...about what happened that day
on the football field.

1009
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,600
That I'd blame him.

1010
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,880
Scared that I'd walk out on him.

1011
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,560
Skipper afraid! I couldn't believe that.

1012
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,040
I mean, inside he was real
deep-down scared...

1013
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,400
...and he broke like a rotten stick.

1014
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,760
He started crying:

1015
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,560
"I need you."

1016
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,120
He kept babbling, "Help me."

1017
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,320
Me help him?

1018
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,000
How does one drowning man...

1019
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,760
...help another drowning man?

1020
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,080
So you hung up on him.

1021
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,720
And then that phone...

1022
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,240
...started to ring again.

1023
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,320
It rang and it rang
and it wouldn't stop ringing.

1024
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,600
And I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move or run from that sound.

1025
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,280
It kept ringing louder and louder.

1026
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:16,200
And the sound of that
was like Skipper screaming for help.

1027
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,600
And I couldn't pick it up.

1028
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,640
So that's when he killed himself?

1029
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,080
Yes.

1030
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,840
Because I let him down.

1031
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,680
So that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

1032
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,040
When I hear that click I don't hear
the sound of that phone ringing anymore.

1033
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,240
And I can stop thinking.

1034
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm ashamed!

1035
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,440
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.

1036
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,520
But the truth is always there
in the morning, isn't it?

1037
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,200
And it's here right now.

1038
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,200
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
That's all it is. Self-pity!

1039
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,640
You didn't kill Skipper. He killed himself.

1040
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,800
You, Skipper and lots like you,
living in a kid's world...

1041
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,720
...playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

1042
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,960
Life ain't no damn football game.

1043
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,160
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

1044
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,800
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid...

1045
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,640
...pretending you hear cheers
when there ain't any.

1046
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,920
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

1047
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,440
Heroes in the real world...

1048
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,000
...live 24 hours a day,
not just two hours in a game.

1049
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,840
Mendacity! You won't--

1050
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,640
You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

1051
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,840
The truth is pain and sweat...

1052
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,120
...paying bills and making love to a woman
that you don't love anymore.

1053
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
The truth is dreams that don't come true...

1054
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,320
...and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

1055
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,520
Now, here.

1056
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,360
The truth is you never growed up.

1057
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,640
- Grown-ups don't hang up on friends.
- Get away.

1058
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,880
And they don't hang up on their wives.
They don't hang up on life.

1059
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,600
Now that's the truth that you can't face.

1060
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,320
- Can you face the truth?
- Try me.

1061
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,960
Sure, somebody else's truth!

1062
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,800
- You're running again.
- Yeah, I am.

1063
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,400
Running from lies,
like birthday congratulations...

1064
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,920
...and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any, and--

1065
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,920
Please, let me go home.

1066
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,920
- What did you say?
- I don't remember.

1067
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,120
- There won't be any happy returns?
- Forget it.

1068
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,760
Let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

1069
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,080
Who said I was going to leave
the place or anything?

1070
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,760
I'll outlive you.

1071
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,000
I'll bury you.

1072
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,160
- I'll buy your coffin.
- That's right.

1073
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,280
Many happy returns.

1074
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,600
They were lying...

1075
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,120
...weren't they, son...

1076
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,640
...about that report from the clinic?

1077
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,000
This pain...

1078
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,840
...that keeps grabbing at me....

1079
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,320
It's death...

1080
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,560
...ain't it?

1081
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,960
Answer me!

1082
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,680
The truth!

1083
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,520
You said it yourself.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

1084
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,280
Brick, wait!

1085
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,400
Look at us, Maggie.

1086
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,000
The great Pollitt Enterprises...

1087
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,480
...stuck in the....

1088
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,280
I hurt him, Maggie.

1089
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,640
I hurt him really bad.

1090
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,480
What's the matter? What's happened?

1091
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,480
- Why is Big Daddy--
- We've got to talk to you.

1092
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,400
- Get Dr. Baugh!
- Where is he?

1093
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,640
I don't know, just find him.

1094
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,560
Doc!

1095
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,760
I wouldn't go down to him right now.

1096
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,040
Sweetheart!

1097
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,440
Big Daddy, can you hear me?

1098
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,280
What are you doing?

1099
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,160
I'm coming down.

1100
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,000
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

1101
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,080
If that pain gets too bad...

1102
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,840
...this is morphine...

1103
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,920
...and a syringe.

1104
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,080
The instructions are written out.

1105
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,160
It's no use pretending anymore.

1106
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,880
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

1107
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,000
Make it easy on yourself.

1108
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,680
Here.

1109
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,920
You'd better take off those wet clothes.

1110
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,600
Why?

1111
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,040
You afraid I might catch cold and die?

1112
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,480
Why can't I go down to him?

1113
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,040
Well, he's....

1114
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,840
His stomach's upset, Ida.

1115
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,480
All he needs is a peppermint.

1116
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,800
It's time we had that talk, Doc.

1117
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,760
- It'll be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.

1118
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,040
So I've noticed. But there are times--

1119
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,120
It's time we all had our talk.

1120
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,520
What talk are you talking about?

1121
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,360
- What were they fighting about?
- We didn't discuss it.

1122
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,480
What's he doing in the cellar all alone?

1123
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,040
Why can't Big Mama see him?

1124
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,360
You heard why.

1125
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,720
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1126
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,480
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

1127
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,280
...they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1128
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,960
Isn't that so?

1129
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,160
Of course that's so.

1130
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,640
He loves his family.

1131
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,400
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

1132
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,240
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

1133
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,880
It's the party and the excitement.

1134
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,560
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

1135
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,080
Did you notice how he ate?

1136
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,360
He ate like a P-I-G hog.

1137
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,840
I hope he doesn't regret it.

1138
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,280
Who?

1139
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,040
Big Daddy?

1140
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,600
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

1141
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,400
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1142
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,040
And candied yams.

1143
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,440
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

1144
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,200
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

1145
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,520
What's that?

1146
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,960
Gooper say he hopes--

1147
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,360
Shoot! Gooper says!

1148
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,120
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1149
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,240
Ain't that so?

1150
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,000
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1151
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,320
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

1152
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,080
...he wasn't doomed to...

1153
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,080
...what he thought he was doomed to.

1154
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,480
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1155
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,800
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

1156
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,400
Doc, come here!

1157
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,840
I don't need any doctor.

1158
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,720
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

1159
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,280
I want Brick.

1160
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,920
He'll be down directly.

1161
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,400
Sticky rain always makes me sick.

1162
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,960
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1163
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,160
What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

1164
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,160
Big Mama needs you.

1165
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,920
They'll tell her without me.

1166
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,520
Please, Brick.

1167
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,320
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are--

1168
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,920
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

1169
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,160
Let them have it all.

1170
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,680
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

1171
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,000
...you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

1172
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,200
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

1173
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,760
What I can't stand is....

1174
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,880
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

1175
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,520
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1176
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,320
Careful, your claws are showing.

1177
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,760
Close that door.

1178
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,560
Don't close that door.

1179
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,080
Let a little air circulate.

1180
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,680
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

1181
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,040
What discussion of what?

1182
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,680
- Maggie, Brick!
- Now, now, Big Mama--

1183
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,400
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

1184
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,560
...that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1185
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,920
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

1186
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,360
Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

1187
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,520
- He don't need no cure.
- Of course not.

1188
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,960
He'll just drink all the whisky in the state.

1189
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,600
Stop that kind of talk!

1190
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,080
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1191
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,720
Good for you!

1192
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,960
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

1193
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,360
What are you all surrounding me for?

1194
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,360
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

1195
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,480
Are you all crazy?

1196
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,800
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.
- You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

1197
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,280
How can I calm myself...

1198
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,240
...with everyone staring at me
as if blood was on my face?

1199
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,000
What's all this about?

1200
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,200
Sit down, Mae.

1201
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,160
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

1202
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,680
Truth!

1203
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,120
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1204
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,720
The truth is as dirty...

1205
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,000
...as lies!

1206
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,360
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

1207
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,400
Well, Ida....

1208
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,000
I want to know!

1209
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,280
- Somebody must be lying.
- Sit down, Mama, please.

1210
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,640
I want to know about my husband.

1211
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,400
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

1212
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,560
One of the best clinics in the country.

1213
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,120
The best in the country, bar none.

1214
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,840
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

1215
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,280
Right, Doc?

1216
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,600
Sure of what?

1217
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,120
- Not now!
- The test was positive!

1218
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,760
Shut up.

1219
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,440
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

1220
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,400
Hopeless?

1221
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,160
- Now, now, darling.
- You had to know.

1222
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,040
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

1223
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,160
- It's gone past the knife.
- He's dying, Big Mama.

1224
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,640
You get away from me, Mae!

1225
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,640
I want Brick.

1226
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,720
Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?

1227
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,400
Mama, please.

1228
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,880
- I'm your son, too.
- Gooper's your firstborn.

1229
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,800
- Now, listen to me!
- No!

1230
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,080
- He'll be in pain.
- Gooper and I think--

1231
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,640
Shut up!

1232
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,480
Do you want to see him suffer?

1233
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,000
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

1234
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,720
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

1235
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,320
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

1236
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,160
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

1237
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:15,240
Instead of the needle, haven't you got a pill
to make the pain disappear?

1238
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,840
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1239
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,560
Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate....

1240
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:38,920
Does Brick know?

1241
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,360
You know, honey...

1242
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,560
...we was never a very happy family.

1243
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,280
There wasn't much joy in this house.

1244
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,600
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just....

1245
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,480
You know how some homes are happy.

1246
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,040
I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, "Now we'll be happy here."

1247
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,800
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

1248
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,120
And we'll help each other be happy.

1249
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,120
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1250
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,040
Margaret, honey...

1251
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,520
...you've got to help Brick.

1252
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,200
Make him pull himself together.

1253
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,000
- He's going to take hold of things.
- What things?

1254
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,440
The place.

1255
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,600
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

1256
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,000
We've all had a shock.

1257
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,920
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough--

1258
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,120
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

1259
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,520
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1260
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,200
My husband is not going to die!

1261
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,720
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1262
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,160
- We're hoping too.
- We intend to pray for him.

1263
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,360
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to--

1264
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,360
Gooper is your firstborn!

1265
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,120
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1266
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,240
Brick never carried a thing in his life
but a football or a highball.

1267
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,800
Will you let me talk, please?

1268
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,280
Yes, of course.

1269
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,440
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1270
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,000
Almost single-handed.

1271
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,600
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

1272
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,200
Mama, let's be fair.

1273
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,120
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

1274
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,800
...Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

1275
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,440
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

1276
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,640
Big Daddy don't know what he owns.

1277
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,720
The point is I won't see this place ruined
by a drunken ex-football hero.

1278
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,680
Shut up about my husband!

1279
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,720
You shut up!

1280
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,680
He has no right to slander--

1281
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,440
I can discuss my brother
with my family members...

1282
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,040
...which don't include you!

1283
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,400
Why not go up and drink with Brick?

1284
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,880
If the hero hadn't passed out already.

1285
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,480
He may have to pass up
the Sugar Bowl this year.

1286
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,040
Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his run in?

1287
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,680
It was the punch bowl, honey.

1288
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,760
The cut-glass punch bowl.

1289
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,240
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

1290
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,320
I have never seen such malice
toward a brother.

1291
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,640
What about his malice toward Gooper?

1292
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,480
He can't even stand being
in the same room with me.

1293
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,000
Can I help you, Mr. Brick?

1294
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,520
No, thank you, Lacey.

1295
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,280
- Where's my father?
- He's in the cellar.

1296
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,280
And he's alone.

1297
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,760
And he's....

1298
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,000
Thank you, Lacey.

1299
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,520
- It's a deliberate campaign to ruin Brick.
- He don't need help.

1300
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,360
For the most disgusting,
sordid reasons on earth.

1301
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,480
Avarice.

1302
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,080
Avarice and greed!

1303
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,200
No, Margaret.

1304
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,720
Don't cry.

1305
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,120
That takes the cake!

1306
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,000
Who are the tears for?

1307
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,600
Brick?

1308
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,840
Big Daddy?

1309
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,960
Or for yourself?

1310
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,120
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?

1311
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,800
You know why she's got no kids?

1312
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,200
Ask her big, beautiful husband.

1313
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,600
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you?

1314
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,720
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.

1315
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,360
How would you know?

1316
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,840
How would he know?

1317
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,880
Did he ever let anyone love him?

1318
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,520
It was always Brick.
From the day he was born...

1319
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,160
...he was always partial to Brick. Why?

1320
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,880
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.

1321
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,400
He said get married. I did.

1322
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,320
He said have kids. I did.

1323
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,480
He said live in Memphis. I did.

1324
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,200
Whatever he said to do, I did.

1325
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,960
I don't give a damn
whether Big Daddy likes me...

1326
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,720
...or did or never did...

1327
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,960
...or will or will never.

1328
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,600
I've appealed for common decency
and fair play.

1329
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,480
Now I'm telling you!

1330
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,680
I intend to protect my interests.

1331
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,400
I'm not a corporation lawyer for nothing.

1332
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,040
Go get my briefcase out of our bedroom.

1333
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,200
It was....

1334
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,040
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.

1335
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,000
Pa?

1336
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,960
- Give me your hand.
- I don't want your hand!

1337
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,440
No.

1338
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,000
It's my pain.

1339
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,920
That makes it my business.

1340
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:11,000
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?

1341
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,200
I came to apologize.

1342
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,320
What for, telling me the truth?

1343
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,720
- There must a dozen reasons.
- Save them.

1344
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,440
I hate apologies. Especially for the truth.

1345
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,600
Whatever you did, don't apologize.
Just don't do it again.

1346
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,800
If you didn't do it, start doing it.

1347
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Start by getting me a cigar
out of that coat.

1348
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,600
- You think you ought to--
- Get me the cigar, boy!

1349
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,280
It's wet from rain.

1350
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:43,240
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.

1351
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,880
Modern science!

1352
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,360
Get me that...

1353
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,520
...that robe.

1354
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,840
- There's a bottle in that desk.
- I don't want a drink.

1355
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,440
I do.

1356
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,200
I want a drink.

1357
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,240
I've got a million clicks in my guts.

1358
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,920
Knives sharpening themselves.

1359
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,920
You know about clicks, don't you?

1360
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,240
So you bought me a birthday present, huh?

1361
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,240
No, Maggie bought it.

1362
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
- She's got good taste that girl.
- In some things, yes...

1363
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,880
...but not in men.

1364
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,240
Nice soft material.

1365
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,520
This is my soft birthday.

1366
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,960
Not my gold or silver.
This is my soft birthday.

1367
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,560
Here's to my...

1368
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,480
...last birthday.

1369
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,760
Aren't you drinking to that?

1370
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,520
Clickety-click.

1371
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,680
You know what I'm going to do
before I die?

1372
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,000
I'm going to open up all these boxes.

1373
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,840
Will you look at this stuff?

1374
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,520
Bought most of it...

1375
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,240
...when I took your mother to Europe
on that tour.

1376
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,040
Never had such a lousy time in my life.

1377
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,080
That Europe is nothing
but a great big auction.

1378
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,920
Bunch of old worn-out places.
It's just a big fire sale.

1379
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,120
Big Mama went wild in it.

1380
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,880
She just bought and bought.

1381
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,480
She was lucky I'm a rich man.
Yes, it sure is lucky.

1382
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,240
Got any idea what I'm worth? Ask Gooper.

1383
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,040
He knows to the penny
unless I miss my guess.

1384
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,920
Close on $10 million in cash
and blue-chip stocks...

1385
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,840
...besides some 28,000 acres
of the richest land...

1386
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,800
...this side of the Valley Nile.

1387
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,120
That is pretty rich to be.

1388
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,400
There's one thing you can't buy
in a Europe fire sale...

1389
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,080
...or any other market on earth.

1390
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,240
That's your life.

1391
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,640
You can't buy back your life
when it's finished.

1392
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,680
No, sir. Nobody can do that.

1393
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,720
Feeling sorry for me or you?

1394
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,120
For you, Papa.

1395
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,840
That's good,
because you're going to miss me.

1396
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,320
Why did you let Ma buy all this stuff?

1397
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,760
The human animal is a beast
that eventually has to die.

1398
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,400
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.

1399
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,000
The reason why he buys everything he can,
is because...

1400
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,920
...of a crazy hope that one of the things
he buys will be life everlasting...

1401
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,320
...which it never can be.

1402
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,320
I've suddenly noticed you don't call me
Big Daddy anymore.

1403
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,400
If you needed a Big Daddy,
why didn't you come to me?

1404
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,440
If you wanted someone to lean on, why
Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.

1405
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,400
You should've come to your kinfolk.
Those who love you.

1406
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,760
You don't know what love means.
To you it's another four-letter word.

1407
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,320
You've got a short memory.

1408
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,320
- What did you want that I didn't buy?
- You can't buy love!

1409
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,760
You bought $1 million worth of junk!
Does it love you?

1410
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,200
Who do you think I bought it for?
It's yours, the place, the money!

1411
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,280
I don't want things!

1412
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,360
We drew this up--

1413
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,800
- We drew this up with the advice--
- Get out of the way.

1414
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,840
- Get out of my way.
- We're settling this first.

1415
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,920
- I don't want to see it.
- It's a sort of a plan. A preliminary.

1416
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,880
Waste!

1417
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,800
Worthless!

1418
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,800
Worthless!

1419
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:52,920
Don't, son.

1420
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,920
Please don't cry.

1421
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,600
That's funny.

1422
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,640
I never saw you cry before.
Did you ever cry as a kid?

1423
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,080
Can't you understand?
I never wanted your place or money.

1424
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,480
I don't want to own anything!

1425
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,840
All I wanted was a father, not a boss!

1426
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,360
I wanted you to love me.

1427
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,040
I did and I do.

1428
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,520
Not me and not Gooper,
and not even Mama.

1429
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,000
That's a lie.

1430
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,640
I loved her. I gave her--

1431
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,800
Things, Papa, you gave her things.

1432
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,440
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.

1433
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,120
Some jewelry.
You gave her things, not love.

1434
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,560
I gave her an empire.

1435
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,560
I've seen you out there on your empire...

1436
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,800
...with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names...

1437
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,480
...or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.

1438
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,040
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

1439
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,160
Next week,
I'll start building that textile plant.

1440
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,160
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and market it.

1441
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,040
I'll tell you...

1442
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,560
...in a year or two from now--

1443
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,720
The men who build empires die,
and empires die too.

1444
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,600
No, it won't.

1445
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,720
That's why I've got you and Gooper.

1446
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,120
Look at Gooper.

1447
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,560
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

1448
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,200
Look at me.

1449
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,560
You were right. I am a 30-year-old kid.
And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.

1450
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,960
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?

1451
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,560
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

1452
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,640
Look at me, for the sake of God,
before it's too late!

1453
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,560
For once, look at me as I really am.

1454
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,000
Look at me!

1455
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,920
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

1456
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:09,520
On my own in the open market,
I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.

1457
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:14,080
- All of you blame me for everything, huh?
- No, Papa.

1458
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,360
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

1459
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,320
You own 28,000 acres.
You own $10 million.

1460
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,720
You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

1461
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,160
- In my own way--
- No, sir.

1462
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,560
You don't even like people.

1463
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,680
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?

1464
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,680
I want a part of me to keep living.
I won't have it end with the grave.

1465
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,040
Look!

1466
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,080
This is what my father left me.

1467
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,720
This lousy old suitcase!

1468
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,600
On the inside was nothing...

1469
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,360
...but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

1470
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,800
This was his legacy to me.

1471
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,600
Nothing at all!

1472
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,400
And I built this place from nothing.

1473
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,320
And that's all he left you?

1474
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,120
Yeah, he was a hobo.

1475
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,440
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

1476
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:24,040
He worked once in a while as a field hand.
I'd tag along.

1477
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,920
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt,
waiting for him.

1478
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,040
Outside of hunger...

1479
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,600
...first thing I could remember is shame.

1480
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,520
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

1481
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,120
I was riding boxcars when I was nine,
something you never had to do.

1482
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,560
And you'll never have to bury me
like I did him.

1483
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,400
I buried him in a meadow,
alongside a railroad track.

1484
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,840
We were running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

1485
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,160
You know something?

1486
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,560
That lousy old tramp died laughing.

1487
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,360
Laughing at what?

1488
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,120
Himself, I guess.

1489
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,720
A hobo tramp...

1490
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,640
...not a nickel in his jeans.
No future, no past.

1491
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,800
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

1492
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,520
Happy at having you with him.

1493
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,400
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

1494
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,040
I don't want to talk about that.

1495
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,520
Yeah, I loved him.

1496
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,200
I reckon I never loved anything
as much as that...

1497
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,040
...lousy old tramp.

1498
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,160
And you say...

1499
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,680
...he left you nothing but a suitcase...

1500
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,240
...with a uniform in it
from the Spanish-American War?

1501
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,400
And some memories.

1502
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,880
And love.

1503
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,800
Did I tell you all them stories
about my old man?

1504
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,520
About fifty times.

1505
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,520
It's a plan to protect the Delta's
biggest estate from irresponsibility.

1506
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,560
You have to sign.

1507
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,400
Where is it?

1508
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:36,880
What?

1509
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,200
What the doctor left
to make his pain easier.

1510
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,400
Brick's down there with him.
He'll help Big Daddy.

1511
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,000
Help him? How?

1512
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,200
By running the 100-yard dash?

1513
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,320
Maybe he'll cheer him up
by kicking some field goals.

1514
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,320
One more crack, Queenie...

1515
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,720
...and I will not only spit in your eye
but I will punch it black and blue.

1516
01:34:58,840 --> 01:34:59,640
Hold on a minute!

1517
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,240
- I'm not listening to any more--
- Mae was only saying--

1518
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,000
I know what she said,
and I know exactly what she meant.

1519
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,840
The only world that Brick knows--

1520
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,080
It's not a world he made.

1521
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,080
Ladies!

1522
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,280
- No.
- Why won't you take it?

1523
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,440
- It'll kill the pain, that's all.
- It'll kill the senses, too.

1524
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,320
When you've got pain
at least you know you're alive.

1525
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,040
It's easing somewhat now.

1526
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,640
When you've got pain...

1527
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,960
...it's better to judge yourself,
a lot of things.

1528
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,560
I'm not going to stupefy myself
with that stuff.

1529
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,240
I want to think clear.

1530
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,840
I want to see everything
and feel everything.

1531
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,720
Then I won't mind going.

1532
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,920
I've got the guts to die.

1533
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,960
What I want to know is,
have you got the guts to live?

1534
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,760
I don't know.

1535
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,520
We can try.

1536
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,240
We could start by helping each other
up these stairs.

1537
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,400
Yes, sir.

1538
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,920
At least read them.

1539
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,200
Put those papers away
before I tear them up.

1540
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,560
I don't want to know what's in them.

1541
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,080
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language.
I'm his wife, not his widow. His wife!

1542
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,680
- What I've got here--
- He said it's just a plan.

1543
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,440
Plan basis. What I'll say to your plan is....

1544
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,000
What is it Big Daddy says
when he's disgusted?

1545
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,040
He says "bull" when he's disgusted.

1546
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,800
That's right. I say "bull" like Big Daddy.

1547
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,760
- Coarse language don't seem called for.
- Bull!

1548
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,880
I am outraged by this kind of talk.

1549
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,960
Then stop talking like your father's dead
and me along with him.

1550
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,040
What about her? She wants her share, too.

1551
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,280
As far as Brick is concerned...

1552
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,920
...nobody's going to take nothing.

1553
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,800
Not till Big Daddy lets go...

1554
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,880
...and maybe just possibly, not even then!

1555
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,080
No, Mama, not even then.

1556
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,840
Hello, Bucky!

1557
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:23,320
Looks like the wind took some liberties
with this place.

1558
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,120
- Evening, Cap'n!
- Evening, Cap'n!

1559
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,840
- Storm cross over the river?
- Gone to Arkansas.

1560
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,680
Rain do some good, Cap'n?

1561
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,440
Some good, I reckon.

1562
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,600
Some good.

1563
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,600
You could at least read them.

1564
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,760
Put them away before I tear them up.
I don't know what's in them.

1565
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,360
I don't want to know.

1566
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,080
Can I come in?

1567
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,480
Has the storm done any damage?

1568
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,200
Which storm are you talking about?
The one outside...

1569
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,160
...or that hullabaloo going on in here?

1570
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,680
Excuse me, sir.

1571
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,280
Heard some mighty loud talking.
What's the powwow about?

1572
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,600
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.

1573
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,040
What's in them important-looking
documents you've got there?

1574
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,040
Nothing. Nothing much of anything at all.

1575
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,680
Then what are you and Sister Woman
scurrying and scrounging around for?

1576
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,720
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.

1577
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,920
What's that smell in this room?

1578
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,400
Didn't you notice it, Brick?

1579
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:37,640
Didn't you notice the powerful
and obnoxious odor of mendacity?

1580
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,520
Yes, sir, I think I did.

1581
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,000
Ain't nothing more powerful
than the odor of mendacity.

1582
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,440
- Didn't you notice it, Gooper?
- What, sir?

1583
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,640
What about you, Sister Woman?

1584
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,360
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell
of mendacity in this room?

1585
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,040
I don't even know what that is.

1586
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:02,680
You can smell it. It smells like death.

1587
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,960
What's the matter with that woman?
What's-your-name, what's wrong?

1588
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,160
She just had a slight dizzy spell.

1589
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,640
You'd better watch that.
A stroke's a bad way to go.

1590
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,880
Look, he's wearing
Brick's birthday present.

1591
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:27,480
I haven't given you my present yet
but I will now.

1592
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,480
I have an announcement.

1593
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,440
What kind of an announcement?

1594
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,960
An announcement of life beginning.

1595
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,240
A child is coming...

1596
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,720
...sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.

1597
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,720
I have Brick's child in my body.

1598
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,520
And that is my present to you.

1599
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,600
Did you ever in your born days
hear such a bald-faced lie?

1600
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,920
Shut up.

1601
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,000
Thank you.

1602
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,920
Thank you very much.

1603
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:18,480
Yes, indeed, this girl has life in her body.

1604
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,080
And that's no lie.

1605
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,280
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!

1606
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,880
- Brick?
- Yes, Big Daddy?

1607
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,440
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

1608
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,960
The place and the people on it.

1609
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,360
You want to come with me?

1610
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,840
What were you two talking about
down there?

1611
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,800
Us.

1612
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,320
Me, too?

1613
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:03,800
Yeah.

1614
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,640
You ripped your own brother apart.

1615
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,520
Do you believe that, Gooper?

1616
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,920
- No.
- Well, I do!

1617
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,040
Keep still.

1618
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:20,360
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

1619
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,080
That's the truth.

1620
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,480
Amen.

1621
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,640
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1622
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,160
- Be still.
- She made it up.

1623
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,480
- I said shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us.

1624
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,640
She's not kidding you.

1625
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,120
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even--

1626
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,280
Keep quiet!

1627
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,000
We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

1628
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,520
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

1629
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,680
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

1630
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,760
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

1631
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,040
You heard what Big Daddy said,
"That girl's got life in her body."

1632
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,760
- That's a lie!
- No.

1633
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,640
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

1634
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,040
Believe me, it is desperate,
and she has got it.

1635
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,440
Why don't you say something, honey?

1636
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,480
All right, honey.

1637
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,720
Shut up!

1638
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:23,960
Yes?

1639
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,720
Come on up here.

1640
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,000
Yes, sir!

1641
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,480
That girl's got life in her, all right.

1642
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:45,000
Thank you for keeping still.

1643
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,440
For backing me up in my lie.

1644
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:53,080
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1645
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,000
Lock the door.
