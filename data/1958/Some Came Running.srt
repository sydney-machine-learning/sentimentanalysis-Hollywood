00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,860
What did you expect me to do?
Have the family move in with me?

168
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,442
You knew I just married Agnes.

169
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,843
Good Lord, Dave, you're a man now.

170
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,048
You know that a man
has to live his own life.

171
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,759
How is Agnes, Frank?

172
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:13,391
FRANK:
Ohh...

173
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:16,334
Davey, I did what I thought was right.

174
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:18,436
Nobody can do any more than that.

175
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,255
Sure it was tough on you,
but how do you think I felt?

176
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,556
Putting you in the home?
My only brother.

177
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:25,149
I'm not made of wood, Dave.

178
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,386
If you only knew the nights
that I couldn't sleep.

179
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:31,967
Your story moves me to tears.

180
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:33,405
- Take the check.
- Oh, come on.

181
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,062
Take it.

182
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:37,428
All right,
if it'll make you feel any happier.

183
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:40,442
I'm not gonna fight with you, Dave.
Life's too short for that.

184
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:43,251
Why don't you have dinner with us?
I'd like it very much.

185
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,675
Not that it'll look funny if you didn't,
you know...

186
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,402
...but will you do it?

187
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:51,375
- What time?
- You mean you'll come?

188
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:54,026
If you're sure Agnes won't throw up.

189
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,220
- I'm not her favorite relative.
- Oh, what talk.

190
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,457
Meet me at the store, say, 5.

191
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,363
And I'll call Agnes and have her fix up
something real special, huh?

192
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:05,949
Oh. Ha-ha.

193
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:10,041
Uh, about that little gag of yours
of putting the dough in the other bank.

194
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,790
- You know, that's...
- I thought it would break you up.

195
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,076
- See you at 5.
- See you.

196
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:26,506
No, Frank. Oh, no.

197
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,004
I will not have him in my house.

198
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,790
But, Agnes, he's my brother.

199
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,289
Don't you have any pride?

200
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,382
After he comes here
and deliberately humiliates you?

201
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:37,924
And that...

202
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:41,215
All that slop he wrote about me
in his book.

203
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:43,711
It was nasty and malicious and...

204
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:47,252
Why do you keep insisting
he was writing about you?

205
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,931
Agnes, it was just a novel,
for Pete's sake.

206
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:53,332
Nobody read it. It's forgotten.

207

208
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:00,496
What's the sense of arguing?
I've already invited him. He's coming.

209
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,989
Well, then, don't expect to find me here.

210
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,537
I'll take Dawn and we'll eat at the club.

212
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,449
Frank, I refuse to discuss it any further.

213
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:16,160
This isn't like you, dear. A brother.

214
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:19,102
Do you suppose people won't notice
how we treat him?

215
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:22,076
Do you think they won't talk?
Please, sweet...

216
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:24,145
Now, wait a minute. Let's be fair.

217
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,096
Did I say anything when that
sponging cousin of yours was here?

218
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:31,760
Smoking my best cigars?
Eating like a pig? Did I?

You don't remember me, do you?

00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:00,722
Jane Barclay, I used to have the candy store
down on Chester Street.

225

Oh, of course, sure.

226
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:06,128
That was where a kid could get a stick
of licorice on credit if he needed it bad.

227
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,331
Oh, yeah.
That's why I'm doing housework today.

228
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,985
And you know who I'm working for?
Your brother, Frank.

229
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:13,224
He sure hit the jackpot, that man.

230
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:15,593
My daughter even works
as his private secretary...

231
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,242
...and he treats her
like she was part of the family.

232
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,612
- Is that good?
- Well, sure.

233
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:23,937
Say, you wanna do me a favor?
Forget you saw me coming out of Smitty's.

234
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:25,922
You know, I stopped in for a quick beer.

235
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,862
- You like another one?
- To tell you the truth, I would...

...but no, thanks, I gotta go.

I must say, you sure turned
into a clean-cut fella, Dave.

Thank you, Dave.

Oh, I heard you were in town, uniform.

Now, no offense meant.

Well, it's just a few of the boys
and myself...

...we have a poker game now and then.

00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:24,298
You drink three drinks to my one
and you look like a milk-fed quarterback.

821
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:27,081
Well, now, that all depends
on what a man's cut out for.

822
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:31,944
I can drink and you can write.
Oh, I know about them two books.

823
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:39,582
- Hey, Bama?
- Yeah?

824
00:49:40,387 --> 00:49:42,010
Looks like something died back here.

825
00:49:42,176 --> 00:49:44,989
Oh, no. That's Ginnie's neck fur,
you know?

826
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,336
That's an old female trick. They leave
something so they can come back for it.

827
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:52,529
Ain't you about due in court?
You better take my car.

828
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:54,798
No, I don't have to go to court.

829
00:49:54,965 --> 00:49:57,199
My generous brother squared me.

830
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:01,155
But I could use your car, I'd like to get...
Run downtown and buy some clothes.

831
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:03,714
Any time at all, old buddy.

832
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:06,437
Hey, Dave, uh...

833
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:10,974
...how would you like to make a pretty
nice living without too much trouble?

834
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:13,885
- Doing what?
- Well, team up with me.

835
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,155
I think we could get along.

836
00:50:17,152 --> 00:50:20,629
- You mean gambling?
- Sure. It's a nice profession.

837
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:23,097
And you're pretty good at it.

838
00:50:23,259 --> 00:50:24,719
No, I'm just lucky.

839
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,537
Name me one thing
you ain't supposed to be lucky at in life.

840
00:50:27,702 --> 00:50:29,010
You take my old man.

841
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:32,270
He used to gamble when he was
plowing up his fields, hoping for a crop.

842
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:34,472
Sometimes he'd get one,
sometimes he wouldn't.

843
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,558
So I figure if a man's gonna gamble,
he might as well do it without plowing.

844
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,753
No, I'm not gonna stick around
here anyway.

845
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:46,334
And besides, how can you get
any real action in a dump like Parkman?

846
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:50,295
Oh, this is just my headquarters.
I make all these big towns around here.

847
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:55,131
It's a good idea, Dave.
Then you'd have a lot of time to write.

848
00:50:55,646 --> 00:50:57,368
Why don't you think it over?

849
00:50:57,532 --> 00:50:58,643
I just did.

850
00:50:58,811 --> 00:50:59,988
[KNOCKS]

851
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:01,461
Get that.

852
00:51:05,716 --> 00:51:09,509
Hi. Golly,
I hope I'm not breaking in on nothing.

853
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:12,523
It's right in here.

854
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:18,019
Oh. Thank you.
They told me we don't have to go to court.

855
00:51:18,185 --> 00:51:19,711
That's right.

856
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:26,174
Uh, I got some good news too, Dave.
You wanna hear it?

857
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:30,524
I got a job here in town
at the brassiere factory. Are you glad?

858
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:32,987
I'm ecstatic.

859
00:51:33,564 --> 00:51:37,815
Honestly, Dave, every time you don't have
a couple of drinks, you get mad at me.

860
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:41,267
Last night and in Chicago,
you just couldn't have been sweeter.

861
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:44,808
And now, all of a sudden,
you're acting like this.

862
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,195
Honey, I'm not really mad. L...

863
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:51,112
- I was just clowning. Couldn't you tell?
- Of course you were.

864
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:55,395
You've gotta run along now because
I've got a couple of things to do, okay?

865
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:03,259
Good luck in your new career.

866
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,300
Thanks.

867
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:15,438
I don't know what it is about them pigs...

868
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:18,546
...but they always look better at night.

869
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:20,878
DAVE:
Yeah.

870
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:33,882
Is that some of your writing?

871
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:36,735
Yeah, if you choose to call it that.

872
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,198
Dave.

873
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:58,188
What a pleasant surprise.

874
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,445
- I was just driving by and I thought...
- Come in. Come in.

875
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:09,818
BOB:
Gwen, dear.

876
00:53:10,723 --> 00:53:12,826
It's Dave Hirsh.

877
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:17,242
That's a Canaletto.
I don't know one painter from another...

878
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:20,119
...but when I mention that name,
people are impressed.

879
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,003
GWEN:
Hello, Dave Hirsh.

880
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:23,792
How very nice.

881
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:26,575
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, we're glad you're here.

882
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:29,705
Let's go in the kitchen.
It's our nicest room.

883
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,451
It's beautiful.

884
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:50,843
GWEN:
Dad insists on keeping books in here.

885
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:54,069
The grease from the cooking
is gonna ruin them. He's very obstinate.

886
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:56,654
- I heard that.
- Well, where are you going?

887
00:53:56,825 --> 00:54:00,367
Larry Channock is having some faculty men
over for his watered-down cocktails.

888
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:01,960
- Didn't I tell you?
GWEN: No.

889
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:04,268
I'll be quite late, Gwen dear.

890
00:54:04,434 --> 00:54:07,497
Larry expects me for dinner,
and you know his price. Cribbage.

891
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,774
Well, drive carefully.

892
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:12,714
Oh, Dave, there are plenty of extra rooms
if you wanna stay all night.

893
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,970
- I'll show you the grounds in the morning.
GWEN: I'll show him the grounds.

894
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:18,272
But of course,
we'd love to have you stay.

895
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,447
I wish I could.

896
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,754
Uh, if you should decide on martinis,
the vermouth's on the lower shelf.

897
00:54:25,918 --> 00:54:27,803
Goodbye, Dave. Hope to see you often.

898
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:28,945
Goodbye, professor.

899
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:32,720
GWEN:
Would you like a martini?

900
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:35,852
No, I don't believe I'll have any.
But you go right ahead.

901
00:54:36,021 --> 00:54:37,743
I'm having coffee. It's fresh and hot.

902
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,335
Coffee will be fine.

903
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:45,825
Tell me something... Just sugar, please.

904
00:54:45,996 --> 00:54:47,935
What were you about to say?

905
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:52,283
Nothing much, except that you acted as
though you didn't wanna be alone with me.

906
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,931
How perfectly absurd.
What on earth led to that?

907
00:54:56,098 --> 00:54:59,030
Because you seemed terribly disturbed
when your father was leaving.

908
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,506
I was just a little annoyed with him.
Poor darling. The only time he's awkward...

909
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,259
...is when he's scheming to leave me
with someone he likes.

910
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:08,528
He's convinced himself
I haven't enough friends.

911
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:10,865
- Have you?
- No one has enough friends.

912
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:12,686
Excuse me.

913
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:20,583
- I guess you heard about my trouble, huh?
- Oh, several versions. It's a small town.

914
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:23,429
I hear there's a blow-by-blow account
in the afternoon paper.

915
00:55:23,594 --> 00:55:25,415
There sure is.

916
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:27,615
Have a peek.

917
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:32,030
"Dave Hirsh home,
is jailed after fight over woman."

918
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:34,107
Were you victorious?

919
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,822
- Drunk.
- No, thank you.

920
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,505
Well, that would have been my guess.

921
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:41,298
Were you shocked?

922
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:43,351
Would you expect me to be?

923
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:45,365
I don't know.

924
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:50,153
Well, I'm not shocked, Dave Hirsh.

925
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,749
But I'm not indifferent either.

926
00:55:52,911 --> 00:55:56,486
I hate to see a writer's energy wasted
in drinking, fighting.

927
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:57,992
Any man as gifted as you are...

928
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,966
I brought you that story
that I was telling you about.

929
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,881
From the looks of it,
it's not exactly hot off the typewriter.

930
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:15,416
You got it right.

931
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:18,096
I did that some time ago
and I never could work it out...

932
00:56:18,264 --> 00:56:20,465
...till you showed some interest.

933
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:23,786
Well, what made you go back to it?
My interest in your work?

934
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:27,496
My interest in you.
I think I'm falling in love with you.

935
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:31,685
You fool. You must be a writer,
you're such a fool.

936
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:33,280
I meant that.

937
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:35,106
Now, let's understand one thing,
Dave.

938
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:38,652
I told you if I could help you
with your work, the door's never locked.

939
00:56:38,821 --> 00:56:40,542
Don't you think we ought to lock it?

940
00:56:40,707 --> 00:56:42,593
Drink your coffee.

941
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:46,013
Apparently, you didn't hear what I said.
I'm in love with you.

942
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:48,823
And I was avoiding the obvious comment
that you said that...

943
00:56:48,987 --> 00:56:52,181
...with the ease of a man who's said it
often to an assortment of women.

944
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:54,644
- That's not true.
- Shall we read your press notices?

945
00:56:54,806 --> 00:56:56,779
They got it all wrong, Gwen.

946
00:56:57,556 --> 00:57:00,455
I'd much rather discuss your story.
What's it about?

947
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,663
DAVE:
It's about love.

948
00:57:03,439 --> 00:57:05,892
And I think I've learned a great deal
more about it now.

949
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:08,098
Please, please don't.

950
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:13,118
Now, you sit down and let me clear away
these papers and then I'll read your story.

951
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,866
You correct papers
every night in the week?

952
00:57:17,027 --> 00:57:18,651
Practically.

953
00:57:18,817 --> 00:57:21,781
- Go on any dates?
- Rarely.

954
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,427
How old are you, Gwen?

955
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:32,182
I have a question, Dave Hirsh.

956
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:36,432
- Do you like my dad?
- I do.

957
00:57:36,595 --> 00:57:39,082
You have a friendly relationship with him,
haven't you?

958
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:40,495
Very friendly.

959
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:44,812
Then why can't you have the same kind
of relationship with an intelligent woman?

960
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:48,006
Boy, I'm glad you're not a teacher
of biology.

961
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:51,849
And if I were,
I wouldn't confuse biology with love.

962
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:56,700
Well, let's walk on the grounds
and I'll read your story.

963
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:48,609
DAVE: Hey. When you get finished with
the pages, they'll make nice arrows.

964
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:51,843
- We can shoot them across the river.
- Quiet.

965
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:21,325
Your girl went that way.

966
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:37,803
Dave. Dave.

967
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:55,618
It's that bad, huh?

968
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:59,353
Dave, you have a very exciting talent.

969
00:59:59,745 --> 01:00:03,060
- You mean you liked some of that stuff?
- I liked all of it.

970
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:06,524
The people are so real, so touching.

971
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:10,066
- You're kidding.
- It's a lovely story, Dave.

972
01:00:10,236 --> 01:00:13,550
I cried, and I don't often.

973
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:15,858
Well...

974
01:00:16,088 --> 01:00:17,494
...maybe I'll try to finish it.

975
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,719
- But it's finished.
- I don't know what you mean.

976
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:23,634
Well, the minute the girl leaves,
the story's over.

977
01:00:23,796 --> 01:00:27,437
There's nothing more to say.
That's why you couldn't go on.

978
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:32,487
Of course. How about that?
How come I never thought about that?

979
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:36,581
I'll have it retyped and send it to The
Atlantic. I'm pretty certain they'll want it.

980
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:39,300
So help me, I didn't know
there were women like you.

981
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:41,636
Dave, I have just a minor suggestion
to make.

982
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:45,444
- I'll show you what I mean.

didn't you?

1632
01:43:13,449 --> 01:43:15,685
- I did not.
- Don't give me that.

1633
01:43:15,848 --> 01:43:17,636
Before you got here, she...

1634
01:43:17,799 --> 01:43:21,658
Well, you don't know what this means
to me, Dave. You're not a father.

1635
01:43:22,117 --> 01:43:23,676
That's true.

1636
01:43:23,907 --> 01:43:26,426
So if I hurt anyone, I hurt myself.

1637
01:43:26,626 --> 01:43:29,307
But a father, that's different.

1638
01:43:29,952 --> 01:43:33,178
If he's a hypocrite, he ought to be
a good one and not get caught at it.

1639
01:43:33,341 --> 01:43:34,486
FRANK:
What are you getting at?

1640
01:43:34,653 --> 01:43:36,757
DAVE: That very strict rule
that you told me about.

1641
01:43:36,924 --> 01:43:39,705
Never getting involved
with your employees.

1642
01:43:39,866 --> 01:43:42,712
FRANK: Well, what about it?
DAVE: It's a damn good rule.

1643
01:43:42,873 --> 01:43:45,839
Particularly if you're bringing up a fine,
decent young girl.

1644
01:43:46,006 --> 01:43:48,787
- Are you suggesting...?
- I'm saying it, Frank.

1645
01:43:48,948 --> 01:43:53,485
This is a small town, and what I know,
Dawn could easily also know.

1646
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:54,990
Let's face it, that's no good.

1647
01:43:55,537 --> 01:43:57,291
- Mr. Hirsh, l...
FRANK: Don't listen to him.

1648
01:43:57,456 --> 01:44:00,138
He's no good now, he never was,
he never will be.

1649
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:04,716
If you're through with your lecture,
I'll leave.

1650
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:07,466
I'm sorry, Miss Barclay...

1651
01:44:07,627 --> 01:44:10,408
...but I happen to be very fond
of my niece.

1652
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:16,481
[DOOR CLOSES]

1653
01:44:17,891 --> 01:44:20,957
Frank, I'm... I'm gonna leave Parkman.

1654
01:44:21,123 --> 01:44:23,968
Oh, now, now. Don't get excited.

1655
01:44:24,129 --> 01:44:25,470
He was probably just guessing.

1656
01:44:25,631 --> 01:44:27,834
- I'm sure he was guessing.
- No.

1657
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:34,416
Oh, Frank. Why didn't I meet you first?

1658
01:44:35,258 --> 01:44:37,678
I've often thought about that.

1659
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:43,373
I don't know whether you realize this...

1660
01:44:43,541 --> 01:44:48,589
...but when I married Agnes,
you were just 4 years old.

1661
01:44:49,778 --> 01:44:53,387
If you don't need me any longer...

1662
01:44:54,415 --> 01:44:56,618
...I think I'll go home and pack.

1663
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:28,340
BOB: Oh, Dave, come on in.
- Hello, professor.

1664
01:45:28,508 --> 01:45:32,814
We have a very pretty check of yours, and
a fine letter from a most discerning editor.

1665
01:45:32,984 --> 01:45:34,097
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1666
01:45:34,264 --> 01:45:36,052
But we owe it all to Gwen. Where is she?

1667
01:45:36,214 --> 01:45:39,247
BOB: You have every reason
to be enormously proud, dear Dave.

1668
01:45:39,413 --> 01:45:41,038
DAVE:
Have you told her I've been phoning?

1669
01:45:41,204 --> 01:45:44,398
I'm afraid she won't be with us
this evening.

1670
01:45:44,562 --> 01:45:48,302
I'm very sorry. Here's your letter.

1671
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,804
Oh, thunderation.

1672
01:45:52,973 --> 01:45:57,640
How I envy people who can tell little lies
with conviction.

1673
01:45:57,803 --> 01:46:00,769
She may feel differently
tomorrow or the day after.

1674
01:46:00,937 --> 01:46:04,612
I know she doesn't wanna see me,
but if I just knew why.

1675
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:09,594
Dear Dave, first let me mix you a martini
that's pure magic.

1676
01:46:09,764 --> 01:46:12,990
It may not make one's problems
disappear...

1677
01:46:13,154 --> 01:46:16,088
...but it does reduce their size.

1678
01:46:16,256 --> 01:46:18,589
But where is she?
She must be somewhere.

1679
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:22,546
I'm afraid that's of very little consequence,
dear Dave.

1680
01:46:22,716 --> 01:46:25,561
She seems quite determined
not to see you.

1681
01:46:26,683 --> 01:46:31,829
Please don't ask me why.
I have no right to interfere.

1682
01:46:33,047 --> 01:46:34,420
She's upstairs, isn't she?

1683
01:46:34,581 --> 01:46:36,685
- I'll go see her.
- I couldn't stop you.

1684
01:46:36,852 --> 01:46:39,949
- You're younger than I am.
- Thanks.

1685
01:46:42,224 --> 01:46:45,485
Gwen. Gwen, I'm coming up.

1686
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:48,772
Gwen?

1687
01:46:49,133 --> 01:46:50,594
Gwen?

1688
01:46:50,764 --> 01:46:53,031
Where are you? You're gonna talk to me.

1689
01:46:53,451 --> 01:46:55,108
Gwen?

1690
01:46:56,744 --> 01:46:59,710
Doesn't this strike you
as just a little crude?

1691
01:46:59,878 --> 01:47:02,397
Yeah. Now, tell me what kind of a game
you're playing.

1692
01:47:02,565 --> 01:47:05,880
I'm not an authority on games
or the people who frequent them.

1693
01:47:06,051 --> 01:47:09,595
- Lf you're thinking about the gambling...
- This is my room. I did not invite you in.

1694
01:47:09,761 --> 01:47:11,669
Okay, okay, I'll apologize later.

1695
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,872
Now, look, I just went away with Bama
because you kept ignoring me.

1696
01:47:15,038 --> 01:47:17,655
- Lf it means that much to you...
- It doesn't mean that much.

1697
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,096
It doesn't at all.

1698
01:47:19,259 --> 01:47:22,771
- Lf you don't mind, I'd like to finish this.
- What the devil's happened to you?

1699
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:25,075
When you were on the phone with me,
you were...

1700
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:28,587
- What made you change?
- Don't look for tragic implications.

1701
01:47:28,759 --> 01:47:31,691
- I've simply come to my senses.
- You mean you've lost your senses.

1702
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,550
Good night, Dave.

1703
01:47:33,844 --> 01:47:36,264
Gwen, I'm in love with you.
You said you were with me.

1704
01:47:36,434 --> 01:47:39,629
Don't handle me, Dave. Your hands on me
are not in the least persuasive.

1705
01:47:39,792 --> 01:47:43,051
Look, just do me one thing.
Just tell me what's eating you.

1706
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:46,146
If we discuss it, you could be wrong.

1707
01:47:46,443 --> 01:47:48,232
I said good night.

1708
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:50,723
Gwen.

1709
01:47:50,889 --> 01:47:52,776
Why don't we cut this out?
This is a very...

1710
01:47:52,937 --> 01:47:56,960
If you put your hands on me again, I swear
I'll call the police and have you thrown out.

1711
01:47:57,126 --> 01:48:00,321
I don't like your life.
I don't like your thinking.

1712
01:48:00,484 --> 01:48:05,020
I don't like the people you like.
Now, leave me alone. Stay away from me.

1713
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:51,389
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

1714
01:48:51,559 --> 01:48:52,900
Why?

1715
01:48:53,253 --> 01:48:55,488
Well, you know that magazine
with your story in it?

1716
01:48:55,652 --> 01:48:58,172
It's on sale down at the drugstore.

1717
01:48:58,338 --> 01:49:02,428
- I'll run down and buy one.
- You can't. I bought them all up. Ha-ha.

1718
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,478
I got one more left.

1719
01:49:05,535 --> 01:49:07,769
You know, everybody's been
congratulating me today.

1720
01:49:07,933 --> 01:49:09,907
Really, what for?

1721
01:49:10,076 --> 01:49:11,766
Because I'm a certain friend of yours.

1722
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:15,125
Oh, golly, all the girls at the factory
have been shaking hands with me.

1723
01:49:15,289 --> 01:49:17,709
Been signing autographs all day.

1724
01:49:18,743 --> 01:49:21,775
- You've been what?
- Signing autographs, yeah.

1725
01:49:21,941 --> 01:49:23,184
I write, uh...

1726
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:25,518
I write, "I hope you like it."
And I sign my name.

1727
01:49:25,683 --> 01:49:28,747
- Pretty good publicity, don't you think?
- Get it through your head...

1728
01:49:28,912 --> 01:49:32,207
...that nobody signs their name
to a story that somebody else wrote.

1729
01:49:32,368 --> 01:49:35,682
But, Dave, you sign your name to a book
you send somebody for Christmas.

1730
01:49:35,853 --> 01:49:39,168
Look, stupid, you had nothing to do
with the writing of this story.

1731
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:40,321
I'm your girlfriend.

1732
01:49:40,491 --> 01:49:43,718
That's something else I wanna discuss
with you. You're not my girlfriend.

1733
01:49:43,881 --> 01:49:46,432
I bought you drinks,
we had laughs, I showed you around...

1734
01:49:46,599 --> 01:49:48,485
...but you're not my girlfriend.

1735
01:49:48,646 --> 01:49:52,221
- Everybody thinks I am.
- I don't care what they think.

1736
01:49:52,548 --> 01:49:56,735
You haven't got the brains or the willpower
to sit down and read this story.

1737
01:49:58,335 --> 01:49:59,742
You can't talk to me like this.

1738
01:49:59,903 --> 01:50:03,446
I can't, huh? You haven't got enough sense
to come in out of the rain...

1739
01:50:03,613 --> 01:50:06,262
...unless somebody leads you
by the hand.

1740
01:50:08,827 --> 01:50:12,086
That's only because you'd go anywhere
with anybody.

1741
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:15,892
Dave.

1742
01:50:16,598 --> 01:50:19,661
Oh, Dave, you really should not
have talked to me like that.

1743
01:50:19,828 --> 01:50:21,288
Aw, forget it.

1744
01:50:27,759 --> 01:50:31,172
- Hey, this is sure one hell of a story, Dave.
- Thanks.

1745
01:50:32,173 --> 01:50:33,218
Something bugging you?

1746
01:50:33,387 --> 01:50:36,136
Yeah, it's this place,
it looks like a rat's nest.

1747
01:50:36,298 --> 01:50:37,988
Why don't we get somebody to clean it?

1748
01:50:38,153 --> 01:50:41,697
You suppose we could get that
Ginnie Moorehead to keep the place clean?

1749
01:50:41,862 --> 01:50:45,406
You kidding?
She can't keep herself clean.

1750
01:50:45,573 --> 01:50:47,960
Oh, by the way, when's the wedding?

1751
01:50:49,347 --> 01:50:51,549
- What wedding?
- What wedding?

1752
01:50:51,713 --> 01:50:54,908
Dave, just between you and me,
that little old schoolteacher of yours...

1753
01:50:55,072 --> 01:50:57,241
...you know,
she ain't too good an influence.

1754
01:50:57,406 --> 01:51:03,383
You know ever since you give up drinking,
you've been impossible, boy?

1755
01:51:30,155 --> 01:51:31,877
Dames.

1756
01:51:37,096 --> 01:51:39,364
What do you think
you're doing out there?

1757
01:51:39,622 --> 01:51:41,247
GINNIE:
Sitting.

1758
01:51:41,733 --> 01:51:44,633
That's ridiculous. Come on in.

1759
01:51:51,071 --> 01:51:53,077
Come on inside.

1760
01:51:54,397 --> 01:51:56,251
GINNIE:
All right.

1761
01:51:57,179 --> 01:51:59,797
But you got no right to talk to me
the way you did, Dave.

1762
01:51:59,962 --> 01:52:04,532
I'm a human being and I got as many rights
and feelings as anybody else.

1763
01:52:05,335 --> 01:52:08,115
Okay, so you're a human being.

1764
01:52:09,205 --> 01:52:11,091
Just because that teacher
don't want you...

1765
01:52:11,251 --> 01:52:13,356
...don't give you no right
to take it out on me.

1766
01:52:13,522 --> 01:52:16,008
Will you please forget it, Ginnie?

1767
01:52:16,624 --> 01:52:18,795
You're still in love with her, ain't you?

1768
01:52:18,959 --> 01:52:20,486
No, I'm not.

1769
01:52:20,653 --> 01:52:23,074
Yes, you are. I can tell.

1770
01:52:23,468 --> 01:52:25,888
Look, I'm not in love with anybody.

1771
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,486
Dave.

1772
01:52:32,455 --> 01:52:35,104
Dave, be in love with me.

1773
01:52:35,654 --> 01:52:37,857
Oh, I love you so much.

1774
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:41,433
I never met anybody like you before
in my whole life.

1775
01:52:41,602 --> 01:52:44,829
Oh, I love you so awful, awful much.

1776
01:52:44,991 --> 01:52:47,707
Don't cry, Ginnie, don't cry.

1777
01:52:47,871 --> 01:52:52,472
I'm sorry if I hurt you. Forgive me,
I didn't meant it. I'm terribly sorry.

1778
01:52:53,148 --> 01:52:56,146
You know I'd do anything for you, Dave.

1779
01:52:57,337 --> 01:53:00,151
I'd do anything, ask me.

1780
01:53:01,494 --> 01:53:03,316
Would you, uh...?

1781
01:53:03,477 --> 01:53:06,378
Would you clean up the place for me?

1782
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:14,212
- Oh, could I?
- Sure.

1783
01:53:15,343 --> 01:53:19,050
Oh, sure. Oh, I'd love to.

1784
01:53:19,212 --> 01:53:22,309
Oh, why, sure. Oh, I'd love to.

1785
01:53:23,978 --> 01:53:28,198
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll come every day before work.

1786
01:53:28,871 --> 01:53:31,008
You just call me.

1787
01:53:39,361 --> 01:53:41,912
But you gotta remember, I'm human.

1788
01:53:43,422 --> 01:53:45,363
I'll bear that in mind.

1789
01:53:51,674 --> 01:53:54,389
"And before he was aware of it...

1790
01:53:55,959 --> 01:53:57,683

02:09:02,254 --> 02:09:05,764
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1953
02:09:05,932 --> 02:09:09,443
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

1954
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:12,291
He restoreth my soul.

1955
02:09:12,455 --> 02:09:17,341
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his namesake.

1956
02:09:17,604 --> 02:09:21,726
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1957
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:26,077
...I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

1958
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:30,547
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1959
02:09:30,845 --> 02:09:36,374
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

1960
02:09:36,537 --> 02:09:40,016
Thou anointest my head with oil.

1961
02:09:40,184 --> 02:09:42,931
My cup runneth over.

1962
02:09:43,094 --> 02:09:49,135
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life...

1963
02:09:49,299 --> 02:09:54,249
...and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."
