not sore at us anymore.

have a couple hours

talk about something.

00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,125
We're the ones who are going
to have to go down there

691
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,127
and calm everybody else.

692
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,712
What is going to happen?

693
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,298
They're going to
land the plane somehow.

694
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:40,382
H ow?

695
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:46,805
I don't know, but I
want you to go down there

696
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:50,476
and tell everyone that everything
is going to be all right.

697
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,854
We have to give them
something to hope for.

698
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,031
Damn it, I just got off
the horn with the boss

699
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:05,282
and I'm gonna
handle things here!

700
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,326
Now keep this line open!

701
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,581
They're gonna have to make a course
correction or hit the mountains.

702
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,584
I want Al Murdock on this.
Try his apartment.

703
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:18,795
Now, listen, how much
time do you estimate

704
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:21,215
before a course
correction is needed?

705
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,841
Ouch.

706
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:24,760
All right, hang on.

707
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:28,555
Have them get Exec One ready. We're
gonna take the Lear to Salt Lake.

708
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,808
All right, I understand. Now,
we're getting Al Murdock on this.

709
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:35,145
He was our chief instructor
pilot on 747s for four years.

710
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:36,647
I'll get back to you.

711
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:38,524
Bill?

712
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:39,691
It's ringing.

713
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:44,029
(SIGHS) Look, you know you're gonna
have to handle the news people on this.

714
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,405
Later on,
when the story breaks,

715
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:47,366
there's gonna be relatives and
there's gonna be friends, too.

716
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:50,202
Won't the directors
want you to handle that?

717
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:53,914
My wife and son are up there on that
airplane. I'm going to Salt Lake City.

718
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,666
I'm sorry, Joe.

719
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,334
How the hell are we gonna
get that aircraft down?

720
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,254
Damn it, I don't know! That
plane can do almost anything.

721
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:02,172
And Al Murdock knows more
about flyin' it than anybody.

722
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:04,049
- Now, where the hell is he?
- No answer.

723
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:07,386
Wait a second! He was going out to
meet 409. Try the V.I.P. lounge.

724
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:08,554
Yeah.

725
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:11,974
How's it flying now?

726
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,267
It's on autopilot.

727
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,434
How much damage was there?

728
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,602
Not a great deal.

729
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:19,398
There's just a big hole in it
where the pilots usually sit!

730
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:20,774
(BUZZES)

731
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,192
Yeah?

732
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:26,071
Right. Exec One is
ready when you are.

733
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,322
All right.

734
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,574
And they're paging Murdock.

735
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,742
Tell him to get his
ass out to Exec One.

736
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,495
WOMAN ON P.A.:
<i>Al Murdock, emergency call.</i>

737
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,581
<i>Al Murdock.</i>

738
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:40,919
Alan Murdock.

739
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,087
Al, it's Bill.

740
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,673
What's up? They said
it was an emergency.

741
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,091
It is.

742
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,346
My God.

743
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:54,683
Yeah. You sure it's 409?

744
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,855
Yeah, I understand.
I'm... I'm on my way.

745
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,901
I'm so frightened. What has happened?
Why won't you tell us?

746
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:07,571
Ma'am, we'll let you know
as soon as we know ourselves.

747
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,573
- There's nothing...
- Miss!

748
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:10,949
What's the matter,
Mr. Rogers?

749
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,159
Where are
the oxygen masks?

750
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:14,536
We're below 14,000 feet.
You don't need them.

751
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,538
Everything will
be fine, really.

752
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:18,957
What about the mountains? We're
flying into the mountains.

753
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:22,961
Everything will be just fine. Now,
sit back and relax. We'll be okay.

754
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:24,546
Can I help?

755
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:41,313
Mother? Mother?

756
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,774
It'll be okay.

757
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:49,821
(INAUDIBLE)

758
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,056
Darling, I'm gonna go
and see if I can help,

759
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,016
but I want you to stay
right in your seat.

760
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,185
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

761
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:24,731
And Mom, remember, the 747's
the best aircraft ever made.

762
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:28,360
Remember, it can almost fly by itself.
Dad calls it the big pussycat.

763
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:29,820
I remember.

764
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,705
ALAN: (OVER RADIO)
<i>Nancy, this is Al, honey.</i>

765
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:41,873
<i>We're in Exec One on
the way to Salt Lake.</i>

766
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:44,626
<i>We've cleared this frequency.
Do you read me?</i>

767
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:46,795
NANCY: <i>Yes, I read you.</i>

768
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,963
ALAN: <i>Fine.</i>

769
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,756
We don't have too much time.

770
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,800
I want you to sit
in the pilot's seat

771
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,927
and do exactly
what I tell you.

772
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,013
O... Okay.

773
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,232
Ready.

774
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,276
Now, look at the
instrument panel.

775
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,154
The altimeter is
marked A-L-T.

776
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:14,489
I know that.

777
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:16,575
<i>What does it read, honey?</i>

778
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:19,369
Twelve thousand feet.

779
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:22,664
<i>Fine. The airspeed
indicator is to the left.</i>

780
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:28,086
I know that too. It's 192.

781
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,299
Okay, honey, take it easy. Now I
want you to find the autopilot.

782
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:34,676
Look to your right

783
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,971
<i>at the top of the panel
just below the windshield.</i>

784
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:39,765
<i>There's a switch
marked "autopilot."</i>

785
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:42,934
<i>It says "command,"
"manual" and "off."</i>

786
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:45,020
- I see it.
- <i>Don't touch it.</i>

787
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:47,355
Is it in manual?

788
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,358
It's on manual. It's on.

789
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:57,365
I don't hear you, honey.
Nancy, press your mike button.

790
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:00,952
Yes.

791
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:05,081
Fine. Now, we don't have
anything to worry about.

792
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:08,001
We're just gonna help
the autopilot make a turn.

793
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,462
Do exactly what I tell you.

794
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,673
<i>Put your hand to
the right of the console.</i>

795
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:14,966
The what?

796
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,636
<i>The flat panel just
below the throttles.</i>

797
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,097
<i>There's a gray knob about the
size of a milk bottle top.</i>

798
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:22,808
I see it.

799
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:26,895
Okay. Now slowly
turn it to the right.

800
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:42,410
Nothing's happening.

801
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:48,917
Okay, honey, try it
to the left slowly.

802
00:52:57,467 --> 00:53:00,345
NANCY: <i>It's not working.
There's nothing happening.</i>

803
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,430
<i>It's not turning the plane.</i>

804
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:05,892
Jesus, it's not
working for turns.

805
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,521
Can't you tell us
what's happening up there?

806
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:14,025
They want us to change course just like
I told you. It's a very simple thing.

807
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:17,112
There is a pilot on the radio
telling her what to do,

808
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:20,115
telling her exactly
how to do it.

809
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:25,453
Pardon me. What "her"?

810
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:29,165
The first stewardess
is at the controls.

811
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:32,627
But she is in constant
touch with the tower.

812
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,713
You mean, the stewardess
is flying the plane?

813
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,631
- Please keep your voice down.
- Sure.

814
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,052
The stewardess is
flying the plane.

815
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:44,681
The stewardess is... Thank you, Mrs.
Devaney, but I don't drink.

816
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,975
What difference
does it make now?

817
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,311
You're right.

818
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:54,441
No difference.

819
00:53:58,612 --> 00:53:59,696
Alan?

820
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,909
I'm scared.

821
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:06,578
You're doing
just fine, honey.

822
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,163
There's a problem
with the autopilot.

823
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:09,873
It'll keep you
straight and level,

824
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:13,668
but I'm gonna have to help
you make the turns yourself.

825
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:17,005
I'm going to turn the plane?

826
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:18,298
<i>No sweat.</i>

827
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:20,383
Put both hands
on the wheel.

828
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:23,094
There's a button under your left thumb.
Press it.

830
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,265

Okay.

834
00:54:33,605 --> 00:54:36,483
All right, honey, now
you've got the airplane.

835
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:39,194
Just hold it steady
until I tell you.

836
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:44,032
<i>I want you to find the artificial
horizon on the instrument panel.</i>

the horizontal line through it.</i>

Alan?

839
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:01,007
I can't do this.

840
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:04,052
Why not?
You can do it, Nancy!

841
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,097
<i>Nancy, come in!</i>

842
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,768
Goddamn it, answer!

843
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:16,690
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try it.

00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,778
You scared the hell
outta me, honey.

What do you think I am?

00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,411

<i>That's good. All right now.</i>

850
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:38,628
<i>Turn to the right.</i>

00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:42,799
<i>Turn the wheel to
the right slow and easy.</i>

nose down or she's gonna stall.

finishes the turn.

00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,202
<i>What's your airspeed now?</i>

861
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,121
180. It's On 180.

862
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:17,917
<i>All right. Now, turn the wheel to
the left again till it comes level.</i>

863
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,842
ALAN: <i>Now ease the wheel
forward just a little.</i>

864
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,553
<i>Watch the little airplane
in the instrument.</i>

865
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,097
<i>Don't let it
fall below the line.</i>

866
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:33,308
<i>Wings on the horizontal line.</i>

867
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,021
All right.

868
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:39,230
Okay.

869
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:42,192
Let the autopilot
take it back now.

870
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:45,236
Turn the switch in the top
panel back to manual.

871
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,619
<i>Take your hands off the wheel.</i>

872
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:55,163
<i>Is the airplane level?</i>

873
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:56,998
NANCY: Yes.

874
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:58,500
<i>Good job, honey.</i>

875
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,794
You take a rest now.

876
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:02,879
We're almost to Salt Lake.

877
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,387
We got a big problem.
Look here.

878
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,807
There's Salt Lake
City and there's 409.

879
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,475
Look at the terrain
in between.

880
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:18,269
There is no way we can talk
Nancy through those mountains

881
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:19,979
and down through
a safe landing.

882
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:22,107
It's just too much for her.

883
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,984
The only way is to
put a pilot into 409.

884
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,736
You mean a midair transfer?

885
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,738
A jet helicopter is
fast enough to keep up.

886
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:30,240
We can put a man
out on a tether.

887
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:32,492
Do you know what it would be to
put a man through that hole?

888
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:35,078
Goddamn it! There
isn't any other way!

889
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:38,081
I think he's right.
The only question is who?

890
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,000
- Me.
- No, Al, you're too damn big.

891
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:42,794
What the hell you gonna do?
Go shopping for somebody?

892
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:43,920
Right!

893
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:46,297
I'll call Hill Air Force Base.
They're the experts.

894
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,967
You mean to tell me
you're going to try

895
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,594
to transfer a pilot
into a 747 in flight?

896
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,555
That's right.
We need your cooperation

897
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,640
and the fastest
helicopter you've got.

898
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,100
Now, wait a minute.

899
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,602
You intend to put one of
our men on an umbilical?

900
00:57:59,686 --> 00:58:00,645
<i>That's it!</i>

901
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,480
How's he going to get inside?

902
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,607
The way the stewardess
described the hole

903
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:05,984
torn on the flight deck,
it's big enough.

904
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:10,446
If you'll excuse me, sir I think
it's one hell of a stupid idea.

905
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,407
That's all we've got,
Lieutenant!

906
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,908
Now, what have you
got to help us?

907
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:17,078
There's only one man who's
ever done anything like this.

908
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:19,080
A Major John Alexander.

909
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:21,624
<i>He's in air rescue.
I can try to contact him.</i>

910
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,960
You know how urgent... Who
is your commanding officer?

911
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,504
Uh... Colonel Moss, sir.

912
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:28,882
Thank you.
This is Exec One out.

913
00:58:31,593 --> 00:58:35,096
(SIGHS) Now the question is,
can we get there in time?

914
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,262
RADIO: <i>Columbia 409,
Salt Lake Approach.</i>

915
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,848
<i>We need another
instrument reading, Nancy.</i>

916
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:20,975
<i>Come in, Columbia 409.</i>

917
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:25,647
<i>Nancy, come in, please.
Come in, Nancy.</i>

918
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:47,043
PILOT: <i>Salt Lake Approach,
air force T37-Sage 14,</i>

919
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:49,003
<i>approaching Columbia 747.</i>

920
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:52,131
<i>The aircraft is
in level flight.</i>

921
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:54,133
<i>The flaps are 10 degrees
since the collision</i>

922
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:56,386
<i>occurred during
descent into Salt Lake.</i>

923
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:00,723
Look, Mom, there's another
airplane out there.

924
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:02,433
Where?

925
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:03,685
Right out there!

926
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:08,856
Oh, my God, there is.

927
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,525
An air force jet.

928
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,238
PILOT: <i>Jesus Christ,
you can't believe this!</i>

929
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:18,116
<i>There's a big hole on the starboard
side of the flight deck.</i>

930
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:20,576
<i>Doesn't look like there's any
other damage to the aircraft.</i>

931
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,329
<i>All four engines
seem to be running.</i>

932
01:00:23,413 --> 01:00:25,456
<i>Hard to tell how
much instrument damage.</i>

933
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,417
<i>It looks like most of it's
near the engineer's panel.</i>

934
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,294
<i>Front part looks okay.</i>

935
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:32,297
He's probably
checking the damage.

936
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,589
I'll bet he's gonna help us.

937
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:34,799
He is!

938
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,220
Can you see the fighter now, Nancy?
It should be on your right.

939
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:41,973
Yes, I see it.

940
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:45,101
<i>He's gonna look you over and
report the damage. Stand by.</i>

941
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:50,565
Nancy, the executive plane
is landing here now.

942
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:53,735
<i>We're gonna have some help
up to you real soon.</i>

943
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:57,613
Good.

944
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:08,374
Do you really think
they can do anything?

945
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,669
I know they'll do everything
that can be done.

946
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,755
You betcha! My dad
runs the airlines.

947
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,257
JOSEPH: Well, almost.

948
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:20,011
What does he mean about
"running" this airline?

949
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:23,431
My husband is vice
president of operations.

950
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:26,017
Ha. Some operations!

951
01:01:34,776 --> 01:01:35,943
PILOT: <i>Uh-oh.</i>

952
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:39,072
<i>There's a little crease on the inboard
section of the starboard wing.</i>

953
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:41,657
<i>I see some fuel coming
off the trailing edge.</i>

954
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:45,036
<i>Man, if this had happened
at 20,000 feet, forget it.</i>

955
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:51,542
Plot a rendezvous point. Have the
47 make a 180 and bring her back.

956
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:53,795
We'll have to. We've gotta
make sure she holds altitude.

957
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,546
Col. Moss is on his
way from Hill Air Base.

958
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:56,672
What's the fuel situation?

959
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,674
There's enough, but we do
have a complication.

960
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,176
The air force sent up a
fighter to look things over.

961
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,220
He says there's a fuel
leak on the right wing.

962
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:04,097
Oh, damn!

963
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,140
That Nancy's some woman.

964
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:07,892
She better be.

965
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:09,352
How much do you think
we can ask of her?

966
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:10,937
There's a call
for you, Mr. Patroni.

967
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,980
Everything, I guess.

968
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:15,483
Yeah?

969
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:19,028
Your information is
correct, Mr. Purcell,

970
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:21,572
but we're clearing everything
out of our Los Angeles office.

971
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:23,157
You can understand
that our concern here

972
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:25,201
is for the safety of
those people. Excuse me.

973
01:02:25,284 --> 01:02:26,911
- Who's that?
- A guy named Purcell.

974
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:30,039
Owns a local TV station. He's
sending a remote unit out.

975
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:32,458
What the hell does he want to photograph?
We don't have any bodies yet!

976
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:33,709
Take it easy, damn it.

977
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,628
We're gonna need all the
good press we can get.

978
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:37,004
Now let's go find
that colonel

979
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:40,007
and get that rendezvous course
plotted and on the boards.

980
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,845
Oh, my jewel case.

981
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:47,265
It's bombproofed. The insurance
people insisted upon it.

982
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:51,352
Oh, my idea of heaven is never
to have to pack or unpack.

983
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:53,104
Why didn't I think
of that before?

984
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,355
Here.

985
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:58,568
Here. You know what?

986
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:01,988
To hell with the jewelry.
Let's put my book in here.

987
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:06,242
Thank you.

988
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,123
Here you are, my darlings.
It's all yours.

989
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:16,711
I never wanted to have the damn thing
published while I was alive, anyway!

990
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:29,974
Colonel, is this
thing gonna work?

991
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,810
It's gonna be like trying to put
a raw egg back in its shell.

992
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:34,979
Your pilot confirmed
what the stewardess told us.

993
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,564
The hole looks
like it's big enough.

994
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:39,108
It's a hell of a risk, a long shot!
I gotta tell you that.

995
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,486
It's the only shot we got! How long
before that helicopter gets here?

996
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,279
About 10 minutes.
It's refueling right now.

997
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:44,489
Mean time I gotta
clear with Washington.

998
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:45,740
All right, make it fast.

999
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:57,001
Do we have any morphine
in the first-aid kit?

1000
01:03:57,084 --> 01:04:00,004
No. I'm sure we
have some sedatives.

1001
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:01,255
No.

1002
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:03,424
Help.

1003
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,760
Yes, we'll help you.

1004
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:07,637
It'll put you to sleep.

1005
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,055
No!

1006
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,726
Maybe...

1007
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:16,979
Help.

1008
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:21,067
I understand. He wants
to stay conscious

1009
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,902
in case he can
help us later on.

1010
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:33,287
RADIO: <i>Salt Lake Approach.
Do you read me, Nancy?</i>

1011
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:35,540
This is Nancy. Go ahead.

1012
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:37,166
In a little while, we're
gonna take you through

1013
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:40,127
a 180 degree turn
like we did before.

1014
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:43,464
Captain Murdock will talk you through it.
No sweat, okay?

1015
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,052
I'm not looking
forward to it.

1016
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:50,388
<i>Just hang in there,
Nancy. You'll do fine.</i>

1017
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:51,847
You're doing great, honey.

1018
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:55,685
<i>We want you to look at
the flight engineer's panel</i>

1019
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:58,479
<i>in the center
just above the desk.</i>

1020
01:04:58,563 --> 01:05:02,358
<i>Tell us what the third
fuel used gauge reads. Over.</i>

1021
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:17,832
Uh...

1022
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,877
Twenty two thousand, 500 pounds.
Why, is something wrong?

1023
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:25,172
<i>No. We just want to keep track
of the rate of fuel flow.</i>

1024
01:05:26,215 --> 01:05:27,425
We're not running low, are we?

1025
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,759
<i>No chance.</i>

1026
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:31,762
There's always
an extra amount just in case.

1027
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:34,348
Besides that, the captain always
adds a few thousand pounds

1028

even his mother-in-law.</i>

Hello, this is Nancy.
Can you hear me?

1031
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:58,831
Come in, 409.
Nancy, do you read me?

1032
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,098
Flight 409 calling Salt Lake.

1033
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:19,143
Nancy! Come in, 409!

01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:24,857
This is flight 409
calling Salt Lake. Come in.

1035
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,575
Columbia 409
calling Salt Lake.

1036
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:35,743
It just went out.

1037
01:06:35,868 --> 01:06:36,911
I'll try it.

1038
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,622
Columbia 409.
Do you read, Nancy?

1039
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,707
Come in. Come in!

1040
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:48,673
This is flight 409
calling Salt Lake. Come in.

1041
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,257
- I've got her.
- What's the frequency?

1042
01:06:50,341 --> 01:06:51,759
125.4.

1043
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:56,555
This is Salt Lake. 409, come in.
Can you read me?

1044
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:58,974
Yes, thank God!

1045
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:01,102
What happened?

1046
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:04,689
A piece of wreckage
fell onto the radio panel.

1047
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:08,776
<i>Don't change anything.
Just stand by.</i>

1048

01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:14,198
Standing by.

1050
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:18,077
Nancy?

1051
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:23,708
Are you all right?

1052
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,626
Yeah, I'm all right.

1053
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,380
How is it down there?

1054
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:30,881
It's better.

1055
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:37,596
The sight of another plane
kinda perked everybody up.

1056
01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:53,362
Look at this.

1057
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:54,447
What is it?

1058
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:55,531
I don't know.

1059
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:01,162
It looks like
it's cracked.

1060
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:04,331
What is it?
What's the matter?

1061
01:08:04,415 --> 01:08:06,584
There's some fluid
coming out of the wing.

1062
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:09,003
Did you hear that? There's some
gas coming out of the wing.

1063
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,588
Didn't I tell you before I
don't want to hear that?

1064
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:11,756
I don't want to hear it!

1065
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,466
He doesn't want
to hear it. Oh, wow.

1066
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:26,771
What the hell
is all of that?

1067
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:29,857
That'll be Mr. Purcell.
TV has arrived.

1068
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,944
He knows everybody in town. He'll
get clearance to come up here.

1069
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:39,116
Leave her alone!

You just sit here. I'll be back
in a minute, Mrs. Freeman.

1072
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,586
And don't worry!

1073
01:08:57,218 --> 01:08:59,220
- Mr. Patroni?
- Yeah.

Glenn Purcell, KSL-TV.

1075
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,308
Now I know how
busy you must be,

1076
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:07,812
but we're going on a special
nationwide network hook-up.

1077
01:09:07,895 --> 01:09:09,021
I'm sorry, I'm busy.

1078
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:12,566
Sir, this happens to
be a very big story.

1079
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,109
We have Mrs. Freeman
downstairs

1080
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,611
and I thought the
two of you together...

1081
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:17,488
Who's Mrs. Freeman?

1082
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:21,242
You know, the private pilot that went down.
She is his wife.

1083
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,577
What the hell's
she doing here?

1084
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:26,664
Trying to locate her husband.
Have they found him yet?

1085
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:28,749
Mr. Purcell,
we don't know.

1086
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,918
The highway patrol was alerted
at the time of the collision.

1087
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,045
Why don't you
go talk to them?

1088
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:35,339
You mean you haven't
bothered to find out?

1089
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:38,592
No, because we're too busy trying
to save the 120 that are up there!

1090
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:41,971
Why don't you just let us
get on with our job?

1091
01:09:42,054 --> 01:09:45,558
It seems to me it would be good
public relations to talk with her.

1092
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:47,810
I mean, it was your plane
that killed him, wasn't it?

1093
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,521
Listen, you son of a bitch!

1094
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,773
Take it easy! Joe!

1095
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:55,693
Take it easy you said. Right?

1096
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:00,823
Al, you know, sometimes
the public's right to know

1097
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:03,242

pain in the ass.

1098
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,334
We've got a problem,
Mr. Patroni.

1099
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:13,794
Yeah?

1100
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:17,006
We may lose radio contact.
We can barely read her.

1101
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:19,174
And she's having
the same trouble.

1102
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:20,801
What about another
frequency?

1103
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,469
I'm afraid to let her try.

1104
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:24,388
We might lose what we have.

1105
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:27,141
We gotta get
started, Joe. Now.

1106
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:32,229

How do you read me, Nancy?

1107
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:34,481
Not very well,
Mr. Patroni.

1108
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:38,861
How about now?

1109
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,698
I can barely read
you, Mr. Patroni.

1110
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,825
Nancy, is that my husband?

1111
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:46,243
Yes.

01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:47,805
tension is thick here at
Salt Lake City Airport.

1128
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,474
Just arriving is
the air force helicopter.

1129
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:53,143

will make a dramatic attempt

1130
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:55,813
to rescue 120
persons trapped aboard

1131
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:59,233
a giant jetliner without
pilot and without crew.

1132
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:03,320
And tragedy within tragedy, one
of them, a young girl dying,

1133
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:05,698
unless she's delivered
to Los Angeles soon

1134
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:08,075
for a kidney
transplant operation.

1135
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:14,498
Major Alexander has volunteered
to make this daring attempt.

1136
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:18,002
He will be lowered on a line
from the air force helicopter,

1137
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:19,753
and try to crawl
through the hole

1138
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:23,090
torn into the body
of the jumbo jetliner.

1139
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:25,676
Here they are now.

1140
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:37,271
What a moment this is.

1141
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:49,616
This is KSL-TV.
Would you...

1142
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,327
We want to...

1143
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,051
ALAN: All right.
We're ready here, Nancy.

1144
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:10,387
Remember, I'll tell you
everything you have to do.

1145
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:11,972
You can do it.

01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:14,266
I can't hear you
very well.

260 degrees.

01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:32,242
We don't want you
to lose altitude,

very slow and easy.

turn off the autopilot.</i>

<i>Press it.</i>

Okay. The arrow is on the "S."

Okay. Look at the numbers.

<i>Turn the wheel to the right.</i>

01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:19,957
<i>Easy now. Not too much.</i>

1168
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:28,340
<i>You're doing fine, honey! Just watch
the little plane in the horizon.</i>

1169
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:30,467
I'm watching.

1170
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:36,932
Now, read me the altimeter.

1171
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:41,520
8,000 feet. Eight.

1172
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:45,315
<i>Read it again, honey.
Read it as it changes.</i>

1173
01:14:45,858 --> 01:14:48,902
Seven-nine. Seven-eight.

1174
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,072
She's gotta get
that altitude back.

1175
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:53,824
She's only got
1,500 feet to play with.

1176
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:58,328
Keep turning just the way
you're doing, honey,

1177
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:01,331
but at the same time
ease the wheel back

1178
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:04,459
<i>until you see the little
plane lift up a bit.</i>

1179
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:08,964
Nancy, have you done that?

1180
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:12,092
Yes, I think so.

1181
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:15,554
What's your airspeed?

1182
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:22,686
One-eight... 188.

1183
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:24,938
188. Do you read me?

1184
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:26,940
I read you fine, honey.

1185
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:30,444
Now, what's your heading?
Your compass heading?

1186
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:34,948
240, 2-4-0.

1187
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:39,745
There's a 13,000-foot mountain
right in front of her.

that again, Nancy.

1189
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:53,050
<i>That's 255, 2-5-5.</i>

1190
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,221
All right. Ease the wheel
to the left now, Nancy.

1191
01:15:57,304 --> 01:15:58,722
To the left a little.

1192
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,141
<i>Nice and slow. Not too much.</i>

1193
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:11,068
Tell me what's
happening, Nancy.

1194
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,529
Press your mike

01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:17,241
NANCY: <i>We're turning back.</i>

1196
01:16:17,324 --> 01:16:21,119
<i>The little airplane is tilting
to the left, I mean back.</i>

1197
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:24,873
ALAN: <i>All right, that's fine.
Bring it back to level.</i>

1198
01:16:24,957 --> 01:16:27,000
<i>Watch the little airplane.</i>

1199
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:29,628
All right, level now.

1200
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:34,508
What's the airspeed now?
The airspeed, read it to me.

1201
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:37,261
180.

1202
01:16:37,344 --> 01:16:38,929
Now the altimeter.

1203
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:41,848
It's just over 10,000 feet.

1204
01:16:41,932 --> 01:16:43,934
She's still too low.

1205
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:46,561
Let George take
it back now, Nancy.

1206
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,689
<i>Put it back on autopilot.</i>

1207
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,111
<i>You're doing
just great, honey.</i>

1208
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:56,780
That helicopter's
ready, gentlemen.

1209
01:16:57,322 --> 01:17:00,158
The helicopter's ready.
We're going to be taking off now.

1210
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:02,536
We'll be with you
in a little while.

1211
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:03,912
She's gonna have to
have more altitude

1212
01:17:03,996 --> 01:17:05,956
or she's gonna take the tops
right off those mountains.

1213
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:07,958
It's going to be tight if we're
gonna make that rendezvous.

1214
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:09,042
You want to take it, Joe?

1215
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,295
I'm going with you, Al.

1216
01:17:11,837 --> 01:17:13,297
DANTON: I can do it.

1217
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:20,012
Her altitude's critical.
For God's sake, watch it!

1218
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:23,140
We've been damn lucky so far.
Let's not push it.

1219
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,058
Try not to rattle her.

1220
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:30,856
DANTON: <i>All right now, Nancy,
we're gonna watch your altitude.</i>

1221
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:47,664
And all of you across the nation
are seeing it as it happens.

1222
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:51,126
The rescue team is going
to the helicopter now.

1223
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,586
Gentlemen...

1224
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,838
Gentlemen, may
I have a few words?

1225
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:57,632
How do you propose
to slow the jet down?

1226
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:58,360
Nancy?

1227
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:02,489
I'm scared!

1228
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:05,200
lam too.

1229

1230
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,498
Nancy, look!

1231
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:15,335
Nancy? Are you all right?

1232
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:17,838
Nancy, what happened?

1233
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,770
Salt Lake,
this is Columbia 409.

1234
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,440
Come in.

1235
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,153
Salt Lake, this is
Columbia 409. Come in.

1236
01:19:42,988 --> 01:19:45,574
409, this is Salt Lake.
Do you read me?

1237
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:50,454
Come in, 409. This is
Salt Lake. Do you read?

1238
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:52,289
409. Come in please.

1239
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,291
What's wrong?

1240
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,627
I don't hear anybody.

1241
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:02,132
The frequencies.

1242
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,760
Salt Lake, come in.

1243
01:20:06,428 --> 01:20:08,221
Salt Lake, come in.

1244
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,475
Salt Lake, come in.

1245
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:14,144
Nancy, come in.
Do you read me?

1246
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:19,941
Salt Lake, come in please.

1247
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,194
Goddamn it, we've lost her.

1248
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:23,612
Why don't we have
that air force jet

1249
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,572
try his frequency
again just in case?

1250
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,074
Even if we can't hear her, there's
a chance she can hear us.

1251
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,452
I'm gonna talk her through her climb
just on the assumption she can.

1252
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,662
409, do you read?

1253
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:35,790
They found the small plane.
It exploded on impact.

1254
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:44,299
The radio's dead.

1255
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,728
We're all
alone now, Bette.

1256
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:21,878
The winch will hold
your position, okay?

1257
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:22,963
You got it, sir?

1258
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,047
Got it.

1259
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:27,759
You'll find you can control
lateral movement somewhat.

1260
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:30,720
Using the wind pressure
against my body.

1261
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,848
You'll have to signal us
for in-and-out movement.

1262
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:38,562
I must've made 20
drops in Nam, sir.

1263
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:41,940
But what you're gonna do
scares the hell out of me.

1264
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:44,317
Me too.

1265
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:02,419
Nancy.

1266
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:03,837
Oh, my God!

1267
01:22:05,839 --> 01:22:08,967
Bette, we're too low!

1268
01:22:13,263 --> 01:22:15,473
What are you supposed to do?

1269
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:19,811
I don't know.

1270
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:24,899
I know they worried
about airspeed.

1271
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:26,860
Now...

1272
01:22:28,403 --> 01:22:30,030
If we Climb,

1273
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,825
the airspeed drops.

1274
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,786
I could stall us out.

1275
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,627
The captain!

1276
01:22:44,419 --> 01:22:46,463
He said he could help us!

1277
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:53,720
BETTE: Do you
understand me, Captain?

1278
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:59,225
Thrust levers.

1279
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,229
Thrust levers.
What about them?

1280
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:10,570
Forward, an inch.

1281
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:15,367
All right. Anything else?

1282
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:18,995

Airspeed.

1285
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:52,028
I've done a few screwy
things in this outfit,

1286
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:54,364
but this'll be
a first, huh, Gage?

1287
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:57,867
She'll handle a lot like that 707
tanker you're used to flying.

1288
01:23:57,951 --> 01:23:59,703
But just remember, once
you get her on the ground,

1289
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:02,706
you're still three
stories in the air.

1290
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:04,499
I'll let you know
if it's true about

1291
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:07,210
not being able to make
a bad landing in a 747.

1292
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,504
Control reports 409
has lost radio contact.

1293
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,173
Altitude.
What about the altitude?

1294
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:13,550
Had they made corrections?

1295
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:14,884
Negative.

1296
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,511
What's our ETA at rendezvous?

1297
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:18,054
Few minutes.

1298
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:20,348
They haven't
got a few minutes!

1299
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:49,419
ALEXANDER: We oughta
be able to see her soon.

1300
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:52,338
Probably be below us.
Be harder to see.

1301
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:54,424
MOSS: Two minutes to ETA.

1302
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:57,010
She's gotta be
out there somewhere.

1303
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:26,289
There she is.

1304
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:33,630
She's flying it!
She's flying it herself!

1305

1308
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:48,848
I'll see you in Salt Lake.

1309

- I am!

knows how to fly that bloody plane?

plain suicide, sir.

you wear a chute.

you up into the blades.

back and sit down?

1365
01:35:04,825 --> 01:35:06,202
What about fire'?
It might explode.

1366
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:07,411
There's no danger!

1367
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:10,164
ARNIE: My God!

1368
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,540
You get him
the hell outta here!

1369
01:35:11,624 --> 01:35:15,669
Please, sir, we know about the fuel.
Now, it's being handled.

1370
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:18,547
It's all right.
We're handling it, okay?

1371
01:35:18,631 --> 01:35:22,134
Now go and sit down and relax. It's fine.
I'll get you a drink.

1372
01:35:46,242 --> 01:35:47,827
Shh!

1373
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:49,537
Will you look at this?

1374
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,247
The collision wiped out
so many instruments,

1375
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:53,791
I can't tell what's
working and what isn't.

1376
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:57,253
Alan, we are going to
be able to land, aren't we?

1377
01:35:57,336 --> 01:35:58,629
You tell me, honey.

1378
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:00,673
I don't know if I can get
the landing gear down.

1379
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:03,884
If it does come down, I can't tell
if it's locked into position.

1380
01:36:03,968 --> 01:36:06,429
Well, nothing I can
do about it, I guess.

1381
01:36:06,512 --> 01:36:07,972
How's Stacy?

1382
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:10,015
Not good.

1383
01:36:11,267 --> 01:36:12,268
Radio too?

1384
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:15,187
The radio's dead.
I've tried every channel.

1385
01:36:15,271 --> 01:36:17,398
Well, here we go.

1386
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:22,695
Let's see if you can land one of these
things by the seat of your pants.

1387
01:36:44,884 --> 01:36:46,260
PATRONI: How long
before we land?

1388
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:47,761
MOSS: Two minutes.

1389
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,019
Salt Lake, this is Patroni.
We're on our way down.

1390
01:36:55,102 --> 01:36:58,355
We're gonna need ambulances for
the girl and the injured crew.

1391
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:00,441
Hit the red button.
I want the field cleared!

1392
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,537
Go have the passengers fasten
their seat belts, honey.

1393
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:15,623
Tell the girls to hang on.

1394
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,917
Go do your thing, baby.

1395
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:25,257
Are we okay?
Have you heard anything?

1396
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:26,884
Nothing.

1397
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:34,266
Let's get back to work.
Prepare for landing.

1398
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:37,269
Remember the intercom
systems aren't working.

1399
01:37:38,938 --> 01:37:41,524
Honey, we'll have to
stow this for landing.

1400
01:37:42,358 --> 01:37:44,360
I'll take good care of it.

1401
01:38:50,009 --> 01:38:52,011
(HONKING)

1402
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,030
Buckle yourself in.

1403
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:36,972
ALAN: They're down, baby.
Just hope they're locked.

1404
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:48,484
Almost home.

1405
01:39:51,362 --> 01:39:52,529
Are we landing?

1406
01:39:52,655 --> 01:39:53,864
Yes, Janice.

1407
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:56,408
I knew we'd be all right.

1408
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:08,671
Nancy?

1409
01:40:08,754 --> 01:40:10,089
Yes?

1410
01:40:10,172 --> 01:40:11,548
I love you.

1411
01:40:18,722 --> 01:40:19,973
Over the fence.

(SQUEALING TIRES)

1413
01:40:54,508 --> 01:40:56,009
Damn!

1414
01:40:56,093 --> 01:40:58,595
- What's the matter?
- Brake pressure's dropping.

1415
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:01,181
I don't know if we've got
enough left to stop this thing.

1416
01:41:04,643 --> 01:41:07,980
Jesus! This mother's got
10 backup systems too.

1417
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:19,408
He can't stop her!

1419
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,021
Hang on.

(SIGHS)

1421
01:42:15,756 --> 01:42:19,009
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for flying Columbia Airlines.

1422
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:21,303
<i>Unfasten seat belts. Come on.
Let's go out this way!</i>

1423
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:39,655
What, are we here already?

1424
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:42,866
Are we here already?
No! We're still in Washington.

1425
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:44,576
What's going on?

1426
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:51,667
Move, move, move, move.

1427
01:43:03,095 --> 01:43:05,264
The ambulance is waiting
to take you to the hospital.

1428
01:43:05,347 --> 01:43:07,516
They have a kidney, and they're
ready for the transplant.

1429
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:09,560
All right. Get in there!

1430
01:43:24,241 --> 01:43:26,869
No, Miss Swanson, no.
You can't take that with you.

1431
01:43:26,952 --> 01:43:29,538
You'll get it later.
Jump! Jump!

1432
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:35,419
Let's go. Get outta here!

1433
01:43:40,299 --> 01:43:42,342
I really was in that picture.

1434
01:43:42,426 --> 01:43:45,012
Remember when
the kids walked...

1435
01:43:45,095 --> 01:43:48,056
Ran into...
The hamburger shop?

1436
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:49,391
I was the short-order cook.

1437
01:43:49,516 --> 01:43:50,767
No, I don't remember that.

1438
01:43:50,851 --> 01:43:52,895
Well I, I... One of the
hamburgers hit me on the head.

1439
01:43:52,978 --> 01:43:54,021
Don't you remember?

1440
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:55,522
- I'll show you the scar.
- I believe you.

1441
01:43:55,606 --> 01:43:57,733
That's a big pussycat, dad!

1442
01:43:59,693 --> 01:44:01,361
No, it's a tomcat.

1443
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:16,168
Oh, it's so beautiful!

1444
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:20,005
Every morning is beautiful.
You're just too young to know.
