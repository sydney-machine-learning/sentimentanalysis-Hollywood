1
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,273
Virtually the entire
Pacific coast

2
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:27,319
of our hemisphere rests on
a series of geologic faults.

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,029
One of the most unstable of these

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,408
is the San Andreas
fault, running 600 miles

5
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,119
through the state of California.

6
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,913
Some sections of the fault are slipping.

7
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,125
The two sides are sliding
past each other slowly.

8
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:43,752
The streams accumulating
are being dissipated

9
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:46,923
rather harmlessly without
generating large earthquakes.

10
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:51,969
At two points, however, the
sides of the fault are locked,

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,762
permitting no slippage.

12
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:56,682
Elastic strain energy is being built up.

13
00:00:56,683 --> 00:01:00,144
Invisibly, the land is
being compressed and warped,

14
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:02,438
storing energy like a colossal spring

15
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,815
under the crust of the earth.

16
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,192
Many scientists feel this
energy will break loose

17
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,319
and a cataclysmic earthquake will occur

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,572
within the next decade.

19
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,408
Other feels it could happen tomorrow.

20
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,243
One of the critical points

21
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,162
is north of San Francisco.

22
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:21,207
The other, just a few
miles east of Los Angeles.

23
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,390
Damn it!

24
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,894
Your last words last night.

25
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:49,771
The very first words you
greet me with this morning.

26
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,148
Don't you think you ought
to do something about

27
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,691
expanding your vocabulary?

28
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,653
Yeah, while you expand your chest.

29
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:59,323
Didn't you get enough
exercise jogging this morning?

30
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,201
Don't you ever get tired?

31
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:03,118
I don't think I'm gonna have time

32
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,453
for breakfast this morning.

33
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,287
Why not?

34
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,121
It's ready.

35
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,206
Denise Marshall's boy

36
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,249
asked me for an autographed football.

37
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,001
I'm gonna drop it off on
the way to the office.

38
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,170
An autographed football from you.

39
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,756
And you haven't played
football in 16 years.

40
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,257
Well, I guess it's part

41
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,219
of this nostalgic binge everybody's on.

42
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,179
Anyway, it's the ball
Frank Gifford signed.

43
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,348
That's the signature he really wants.

44
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,642
You know, I find it peculiar.

45
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:27,810
Almost amusing.

46
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,939
The widow Brian Marshall
comes back into town

47
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,357
after seven months,

48
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:37,444
and you rush off without even
so much as a cup of coffee.

49
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,278
But if I ask you...

50
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,821
If you ask me to stop off at the market

51
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,616
to pick up a head of lettuce
for you, I'd find some excuse.

52
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,412
You know, if it wasn't
7:30 in the morning,

53
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,164
I would have a drink.

54
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,958
I didn't know you
were a clock-watcher.

55
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,042
What?

56
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,502
What did you say?

57
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,671
I said, I didn't know
you were a clock-watcher.

58
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,007
Don't you dare lower
your voice to me.

59
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,801
Look, what's this all about?

60
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:01,635
I know you.

61
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:02,844
I've been married to you long enough.

62
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,972
I know the more contempt you feel for me,

63
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:06,890
the lower the voice.

64
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:09,769
Ah, Remy, you'd hardly call
this a marriage, would you?

65
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,062
Going now, Remy.

66
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,071
I said, I'm leaving.

67
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,115
Remy.

68
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:30,414
Remy.

69
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,087
Remy.

70
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,389
Remy!

71
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,390
Remy.

72
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,116
Jim?

73
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,534
Stewart Graff.

74
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,535
She's done it again.

75
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,788
Yeah, I think we'll get faster action

76
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,540
if you call the ambulance.

77
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,585
Well, of course I'll induce vomiting.

78
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,836
I know the rules by now.

79
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,297
Just get over here, will you?

80
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,474
Oh!

81
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,308
Oh, my God.

82
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,309
Oh, oh.

83
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,456
If you're going to throw
the pills in the toilet,

84
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,291
you might at least flush it.

85
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,094
Man, that was a jolt.

86
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:08,720
You can forget your coffee.

87
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,931
We got an emergency inspection to run.

88
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,433
I'm off duty in half an hour.

89
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,393
It was just a little tremor.

90
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,520
That's a solid concrete dam.

91
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,730
Well, those are the rules, Max.

92
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,316
You can always use the overtime.

93
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,610
Yeah, I suppose so.

94
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,711
Is everything okay?

95
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,963
Yeah.

96
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,215
Why don't you check the base?

97
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,217
I'll look down below.

98
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,123
At 7:46 this morning,

99
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,168
a minor earthquake registering
3.1 on the Richter scale

100
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,170
was felt in the Los Angeles area.

101
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,671
No injuries were reported.

102
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,131
However, minimal property damage...

103
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,092
Repeating a KJB Sig Alert.

104
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,721
Hello, Laura?

105
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:33,555
This is Mr. Graff.

106
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,556
My secretary in yet?

107
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,058
Yeah.

108
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,977
Well, tell her I'll be a little late, huh?

109
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:39,936
All right, Mr. Graff, I'll tell her.

110
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,104
Let me speak to him.

111
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:41,938
Oh, Mr. Graff?

112
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,499
Just a moment, it's your father-in-law.

113
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,860
Stewart, see me as soon as you come in.

114
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,778
I want to go over that
Bill Cameron matter again.

115
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,238
Sam, I'm not gonna budge on this.

116
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,616
I don't want to lose this contract.

117
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,493
I'll talk to you about it later.

118
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:55,327
Thank you.

119
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,288
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,289
Fred?

121
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,127
Fred?

122
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,023
Fred!

123
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,024
Fred?

124
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,730
Watch it, Lou.

125
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,609
You nearly wrecked us
up in that last turn.

126
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,161
You see?

127
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:20,996
I told you.

128
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:21,997
We're gonna hear about that one.

129
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:22,998
Want to drive, Emilio?

130
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:23,832
No, no, no.

131
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,073
You're driving, you're driving.

132
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,718
We're over the city line.

133
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,219
The Captain will bust our rumps

134
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,888
if we mess up here in the county again.

135
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,267
Do you remember what
happened with that guy Merle?

136
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,561
I still don't think his
gun went off by accident.

137
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:48,315
I get along just fine with nine toes.

138
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,234
I told you to stay
out of the county.

139
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:33,985
Merle...

140
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,029
Some guys are just too goddamned dumb

141
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,198
to stay where they belong.

142
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:41,326
Do you know who owns that
hedge you just wrecked?

143
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,286
I'm gonna tell you, Slade.

144
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,705
It's Zsa Zsa Gabor.

145
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,130
Corry, forget about the dishes.

146
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,341
You'll be late for school

147
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,634
Come on.

148
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,264
And remember to go to Mrs.
Clark's when you come back, huh?

149
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,185
She'll look after you until
I'm home from the studio.

150
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,458
Stewart!

151
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,334
Hi.

152
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,335
Come on in.

153
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,214
Hi.

154
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,048
You brought it.

155
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,801
Sorry I forgot it last week.

156
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,803
Where did Frank Gifford sign?

157
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,471
Right there under the laces.

158
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,056
Yeah.

159
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,474
Thanks, Mr. Graff.

160
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,144
That'll look great on my bookcase.

161
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,437
That's really nice of you.

162
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,396
Thank you.

163
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,940
Couldn't let down my last fan.

164
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,775
Hurry.

165
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,569
Okay, have a good day.

166
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,403
Goodbye, mom.

167
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,237
Bye-bye.

168
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,238
So long.

169
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:02,449
You know what?

170
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,283
What?

171
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,868
I've got a part in a movie.

172
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,035
Oh, great.

173
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,454
Yeah, great.

174
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,956
Three days shooting, 22 lines.

175
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:10,832
It's hard.

176
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,709
I've been out of it so long.

177
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,127
Well, at least I feel alive again,

178
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,172
and I didn't for so long after Brian died.

179
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,008
Well, I guess I should get dressed.

180
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,135
Hey, did you feel that
tremor this morning?

181
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,887
It really wasn't very strong.

182
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:24,721
No?

183
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:25,764
Would you like some coffee?

184
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:26,598
Yeah.

185
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,143
If there's an unbroken cup
somewhere that I can find.

186
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,520
It'll have to be instant.

187
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,190
Yeah, well, instant will be fine.

188
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,359
You know, Barbara
says you're the best,

189
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,194
Barbara?

190
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,571
Yes, Barbara.

191
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,739
Your boss's secretary.

192
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,240
Oh.

193
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,743
And my one good friend.

194
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:51,498
Well, she says you're the
best engineer in the country.

195
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,292
Yeah, well, Barbara's paid
to say things like that.

196
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,629
Oh, that's the script
of the movie I'm doing.

197
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,631
"Movie I'm doing."

198
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,091
That's the overstatement of the year.

199
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,803
Here I am, two small scenes,

200
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,346
and I'm so worried, I'm so nervous.

201
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:08,598
I was up all night trying to figure out

202
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,142
how to make this thing work.

203
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,480
Can I help you?

204
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:17,065
Yes.

205
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,692
You could read the lines with me.

206
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,194
It's just one scene.

207
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,195
One page.

208
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,406
I think I know it.

209
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,116
Right here, near the top.

210
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:28,952
Okay, let me fill you in.

211
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,955
I play a bit player.

212
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,457
Now, the part you read
is a big movie star.

213
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,627
A drunk, a gambler, married
18 times, the whole thing.

214
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,255
And there's a dinner party.

215
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:43,550
Now, an assistant director invited me,

216
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,803
only he's not enough of
a, whatever, gentleman,

217
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:47,637
to pick me up.

218
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,471
I have to drive myself.

219
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,931
Well, that's okay.

220
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,600
Now, they're all talking about
me just before I come in.

221
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,854
You know, asking him the usual
questions about bit players.

222
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,897
Talk, talk, talk, talk.

223
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,731
I come in.

224
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,984
Introductions,
introductions, introductions.

225
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:05,948
Then our big star, you,
makes his appearance.

226
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,659
You ignore me, for quite a while.

227
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:12,872
So, I say to you, "Hello, Mr. Sheppard.

228
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,498
"It's been a long time.

229
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,499
"How have you been?"

230
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:18,835
And you say,

231
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,171
"Do we know each other?"

232
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,172
"You bet we do."

233
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,260
That kind of a script.

234
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,762
Oh, and the character I'm playing

235
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,640
is also supposed to be a nymphomaniac.

236
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,100
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

237
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,560
And the director of the picture

238
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,562
is a strong believer in typecasting.

239
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,771
But anyway, I'll cope with that.

240
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,898
You want it black?

241
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:40,732
Yeah.

242
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,566
Black's...

243
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,151
And don't worry.

244
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,110
Worry about what?

245
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,612
I'm not a nympho.

246
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,322
Mind you, I'm not Mary Poppins, either,

247
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:48,740
but I'm far from being,

248
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,659
what's the male equivalent of a nympho?

249
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:52,870
Satyr, I think.

250
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,746
Satyr?

251
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:55,788
Yeah.

252
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,623
Oh.

253
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,584
And you don't need to worry, either.

254
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,085
Worry?

255
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,089
What I mean is, I'm
not Billy Graham exactly,

256
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,592
but I'm no satyr.

257
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,010
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:13,222
That tremor must've stopped the clock.

259
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,933
It's a little after nine.

260
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,684
And I have a 10 o'clock call.

261
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,936
- I'm sorry, I've got to run.
- I'm overdue at the office.

262
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,187
Listen, thank you for everything.

263
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,357
I mean, the cueing, the
football and the sympathy.

264
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:23,984
And as Mary Poppins would say,

265
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,531
"Bye-bye."

266
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,499
Eight stitches to close his
lower lip, six loosened teeth.

267
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,167
You aren't supposed to do things like that

268
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,127
to a brother officer.

269
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,170
Not a brother officer, sir.

270
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,380
Merle is a county cop.

271
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:49,092
I'm talking about Los
Angeles cops and county cops.

272
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,885
That kid stole a car.

273
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,429
Then he got stoned and he
slammed into a little girl.

274
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,723
A little Mexican girl,
about six years old.

275
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,642
That little girl was thrown
about 15 feet in the air.

276
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,519
She was probably dead
before she hit the sidewalk.

277
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,771
Her blood covered three
whole cement squares.

278
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,605
Not spattered.

279
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,439
Solid.

280
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,607
Just like paint.

281
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,443
The driver never even slowed down.

282
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,616
You will receive a formal
notice of suspension.

283
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,202
And a date for departmental trial.

284
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,329
Now, get on home.

285
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,387
Hey, Lou, how'd it go?

286
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,700
Michelle, get me
the Valley reading.

287
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,534
Okay.

288
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,910
Have they plotted the epicenter yet?

289
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,038
Yes, sir, it was quite a shock.

290
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,414
Yes.

291
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,249
Yes, nevertheless, there's
no scientific evidence

292
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,627
that a 3.1 earthquake can
loosen dental fillings.

293
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,462
No.

294
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:08,463
Right, thank you.

295
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,840
Walt!

296
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,009
Your turn on the PR desk.

297
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,843
Yes, that's right.

298
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:14,677
Dr. Adams.

299
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,678
Room 14.

300
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,559
He isn't?

301
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,812
Well then I'd like to leave a message.

302
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,688
Walt!

303
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:26,774
Just a minute, okay?

304
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,359
Would you have him call Walter Russell

305
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,321
at the Seismology Institute?

306
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,824
Yeah, it's very important.

307
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:41,412
Yes, thank you.

308
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,539
Here's a strange one.

309
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,625
"Caretaker at the Hollywood reservoir dam

310
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,919
"drowned at the bottom
of an elevator shaft."

311
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,047
They still haven't
figured out what happened.

312
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,299
Okay.

313
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,220
What's the matter?

314
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,429
You look sick.

315
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,347
I just found out Dr. Adams

316
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,599
stayed up at the fault an extra day.

317
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,184
So?

318
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,686
Well, I sent some figures
and a memo

319
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,606
into the Director's office
late yesterday afternoon.

320
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,608
I don't think he's even read them yet.

321
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,151
Figures on what?

322
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,778
Well, I know you'll laugh,

323
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,490
but I think we're gonna
have a really big quake.

324
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,324
Probably today.

325
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,034
Tomorrow at the latest.

326
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,119
And I wanted Dr. Adams here

327
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,412
to back up my computations.

328
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,297
Thought you were leaving

329
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,757
yesterday, Dr. Adams.

330
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,925
We've been held up.

331
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,469
But we hope to have most of the
instruments planted by noon.

332
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,762
Still haven't figured out exactly

333
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,682
what it is you fellas are trying to do.

334
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,350
It's rather technical.

335
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:48,271
That device records minute
variations of seismic waves.

336
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,313
Huh.

337
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,691
Well, better start my plowing.

338
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,817
Thanks again for letting us

339
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,360
on your land, Mr. Griggs.

340
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,611
Once the trench is filled in,

341
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,780
you'd never have known we were here.

342
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,678
Well?

343
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,512
That was nice.

344
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,472
Real nice.

345
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,306
Yeah, tell me this,

346
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,724
you gonna have this thing
ready for this afternoon?

347
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,017
I'll have it ready, don't worry.

348
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,645
But I think we'll need an
extra can of butane there.

349
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,646
Come on, Sal, huh?

350
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:15,942
We'll pick one up

351
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,693
when we go for Rosa this
afternoon, all right?

352
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,694
All right.

353
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,479
What I want to know is, are
you gonna get her to help us?

354
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,451
Yeah, yeah, she'll help us.

355
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,410
Well, she's not too crazy about

356
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,454
our line of work, man.

357
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,373
Miles, I'll get her.

358
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,832
Well, you better, because this Vegas job

359
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,501
is the biggest break we ever had.

360
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,377
Miles, I'll get her.

361
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,211
I'll get her.

362
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,045
What do you want?

363
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:36,879
Will you relax?

364
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
All right.

365
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,592
Wow.

366
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,311
73.

367
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,064
$5.49.

368
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,442
89.

369
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,486
89.

370
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,033
That'll be $20.16.

371
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,203
Forgot to bring enough cash?

372
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,204
That's right.

373
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:11,789
Hey, I'll put this back.

374
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,833
Who needs protein anyway?

375
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:14,959
Don't worry about it.

376
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,045
Drop the money off the
next time you're in.

377
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:26,887
Thanks.

378
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,423
Find anything?

379
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,218
All okay as far as I can tell!

380
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,219
I'll check again!

381
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,807
I guess we won't find anything

382
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,642
until after the shaft is pumped out.

383
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,686
But everything looks fine.

384
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,520
Right.

385
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,272
People drown in elevators

386
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,566
every damn day of the week.

387
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,762
Officer, can you order
these freaks out of here?

388
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,263
They've been scaring my customers away,

389
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,016
and I've been trying to get them to leave.

390
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,604
You got something against religion?

391
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,827
What'll you have?

392
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:13,870
Double bourbon, Jay.

393
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,001
In uniform, Lou?

394
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,338
Naked in a glass will do just fine.

395
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,133
Spiro T. Agnew.

396
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:37,935
You asked to see me, Dr. Stockle?

397
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,396
Yes, sit down.

398
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,482
Russell, this is very interesting.

399
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,817
You forecast an earthquake

400
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,736
in the three to four
point range this morning.

401
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:48,612
We had an earthquake

402
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,948
in the three to four
point range this morning.

403
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,116
I'm impressed.

404
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,492
Thank you, sir.

405
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,911
However, isn't it
rather slender evidence

406
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,372
for predicting a catastrophe?

407
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,168
Sir, these are based
on this morning's signals

408
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,627
from those stress measurement instruments

409
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,422
that Dr. Adams sank during
that experimental well project.

410
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,841
They indicate another pre-shock,

411
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,843
probably before noon today.

412
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:11,844
And if it happens?

413
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,474
Then the big one follows in 48 hours.

414
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,975
At least seven point.

415
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:18,851
Now, naturally,

416
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,686
if that second minor shock doesn't occur,

417
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,438
then it just proves that my computations

418
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,106
were based on insufficient evidence.

419
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:24,982
But I think we have a strong...

420
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,236
Russell, Russell, you are
still a graduate assistant.

421
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,614
Are you seriously contending
that a graduate assistant

422
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,324
would be the first scientist in history

423
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:37,453
to pinpoint a major
earthquake within 48 hours?

424
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,662
No, sir.

425
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,040
But I am following through
on Dr. Adam's theories

426
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,292
and the probability
curves that he drew up.

427
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,752
But I feel that I've been on the project...

428
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,671
Dr. Adams is on a field trip upstate.

429
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,341
I sure wish he wasn't.

430
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,384
Thank you, Russell.

431
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,304
Leave those.

432
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,317
Fiona, I want some figures
run through the computer.

433
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,487
And try to get Frank
Adams for me in Fresno.

434
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:20,829
Yeah?

435
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,289
Morning, Sam.

436
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,290
Morning, Stu.

437
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,671
Listen, you still refuse to
handle the Bill Cameron job

438
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,590
unless he upgrades the specifications?

439
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,591
Absolutely.

440
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,553
Okay.

441
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,845
But you're gonna have to convince him

442
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,597
that those changes are necessary.

443
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,307
I could never talk him into anything.

444
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,726
Oh, do me one more favor, huh?

445
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,727
Don't muff the deal.

446
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,274
Oh, just a moment.

447
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,402
Mr. Royce, your daughter's
on the phone, 347.

448
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,987
Thank you.

449
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:53,988
He'll be right on.

450
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,492
Remy?

451
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,286
Hello, Remy.

452
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,287
Fine.

453
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,418
Well, I was planning on
eating here in the building.

454
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,670
Well, come on in.

455
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,714
No, away from the office.

456
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,340
Oh, it's terribly important.

457
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,925
Oh.

458
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:15,926
Okay, honey.

459
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,804
The Windsor at 1:15?

460
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,016
And try to calm down.

461
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,684
Okay.

462
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,942
Bill, here comes another one.

463
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,738
It's a pretty good shake.

464
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,575
Hey, that shot didn't count.

465
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,035
No way can it count.

466
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,995
Hey, nothing in the rule
book about earthquakes.

467
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:43,829
It didn't count.

468
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,414
Yeah, it did.

469
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,167
Hardly ever get
two in one morning.

470
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,251
Two what?

471
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,128
Earthquakes.

472
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,716
In another half hour,
I won't feel the one

473
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,260
that's supposed to knock
California into the ocean.

474
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,015
The Captain's cooled off.

475
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,851
He's gonna do his damnedest
to straighten things out.

476
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,068
I don't want to be a cop anymore.

477
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,152
Right since the time I was a kid,

478
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,029
I figured on cops helping folks, you know?

479
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,072
Folks who couldn't help themselves.

480
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,490
All right, maybe that was dumb of me,

481
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,534
but that's the way I figured.

482
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:29,416
But folks don't count
for a diddly, do they?

483
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:38,801
Take it easy, now.

484
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,885
I'll call you at home later.

485
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,679
Sure, Emilio.

486
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,667
The shot counted.

487
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,380
Bobby Riggs.

488
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,640
That wasn't there before the tremor.

489
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,850
I know every inch of this dam.

490
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:28,684
It's a new one.

491
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,727
Max, I'm a trained technician.

492
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,561
You're a watchman.

493
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,438
Now, stop trying to teach me my business.

494
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,522
It wasn't there.

495
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,024
There's no such thing as
solid concrete and you know it.

496
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,068
Hairline cracks are bound
to appear from time to time.

497
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,486
You don't panic over them.

498
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,446
The water's rising.

499
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,490
It's gone up half an inch since the quake.

500
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:46,869
He's right.

501
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,038
This is your captain.

502
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,541
We will passing over
Grand Canyon National Park

503
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,501
in approximately one minute.

504
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:20,546
So that you may better enjoy
the grandeur of its beauty,

505
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,257
we will turn the plan to the right.

506
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:43,694
The Grand Canyon is 277
miles long, a mile deep,

507
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,155
and in some sections, 18 miles wide.

508
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:50,576
Now you can see the Colorado
River directly below us.

509
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,953
On your left is the south rim.

510
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,163
On your right is the north rim.

511
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,583
They're about 10 miles apart.

512
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,919
We are returning to our course.

513
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,963
We'll be arriving at Los
Angeles International

514
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,465
in approximately 55 minutes.

515
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,970
Is that all your interested
in is Stewart Graff?

516
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,513
Right now, honey, I'm
interested in our future,

517
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,348
which happens to be in the
hands of Stewart Graff.

518
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,642
Now, you know how important
this interview is.

519
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,644
But I don't wanna live in Los Angeles.

520
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,646
Couldn't you try for a job in New York?

521
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,773
Honey, we've been
over this so many times.

522
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,275
I don't think you realize
what an opportunity

523
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,277
this could be for us.

524
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,905
Well, all I know, is ever
since we've been married,

525
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:31,074
all you do is either talk
or read about that man.

526
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,493
It's like I don't even exist.

527
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,287
Look,

528
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,539
I'll tell you what, after
we stop over in Los Angeles

529
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,499
for my interview, we'll
take the very first plane

530
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,709
out to Hawaii.

531
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,669
And I promise you, I
won't mention anything

532
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,839
on our honeymoon about
Stewart Graff, okay?

533
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,799
Then how will I know if
you got the job or not?

534
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,678
Already I'm learning
there's no pleasing a woman.

535
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,472
I'll tell you whether
or not I was accepted

536
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,058
and then I won't discuss it, all right?

537
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:58,101
But that's no way to
start off a marriage,

538
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,228
keeping things from me.

539
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,146
Katherine, what's the matter with you?

540
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,732
You've been bored with
your card games before.

541
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,359
Now, if you love me, do me a favor,

542
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,778
get yourself a magazine,
play solitaire, anything,

543
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,280
but just let me finish
studying this article.

544
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,114
Tony, you know,

545
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,908
you've never talked to
me like that before.

546
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,077
Do you know this is
our first real quarrel?

547
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,621
Boy, I certainly know
who the boss is gonna be

548
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:18,455
in this family,

549
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,457
and it's not me.

550
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,416
Well, good.

551
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,170
Now we won't have any
more problems, will we?

552
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,172
Let me tell your fortune, okay?

553
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,131
Not again.

554
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,008
Come on, I wanna find
out about your interview.

555
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:30,842
See what the cards say.

556
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:31,843
Shuffle.

557
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:33,387
All right.

558
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,388
If it'll keep you busy.

559
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,058
Roger ASP-153.

560
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,601
ASP-153.

561
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:40,727
Go ahead.

562
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,729
We have had a second tremor this morning

563
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,064
with only minor damage.

564
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,358
There is no reason to alter your course.

565
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,485
Thank you, LAX.

566
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:51,488
Hmm, boy, it's a good thing my
wife's a native Californian.

567
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,906
Why's that?

568
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:54,866
All those earthquakes never bother her.

569
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,994
I wish my wife was more like that.

570
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,245
Every time we have a little shake,

571
00:33:58,246 --> 00:33:59,830
she hounds me to move to the country.

572
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,376
Nine of hearts.

573
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:07,170
Realization of an important
goal, success in your career,

574
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,464
both in prestige and financially.

575
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,508
That's exactly what
you told me last night.

576
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:12,342
Oh, come on.

577
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:13,427
Ah, the eight of hearts.

578
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,346
That's a happy card,
signifying mutual love

579
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:20,267
and domestic bliss.

580
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,686
You will have three children.

581
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:26,231
The seven of spades casts a shadow.

582
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,065
No, no.

583
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,610
It is doubtful whether
you'll have them or not.

584
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:35,282
Double king, ace of diamonds.

585
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:38,744
You have strong character,
insist on having your own way.

586
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:39,871
Boy, that fits you.

587
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,958
Hard working, ultimate
success in business.

588
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,377
Now, the four of spades

589
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,504
and the jack of clubs.

590
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,133
There'll be an illness in a
young person close to you.

591
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,556
Hmmm.

592
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,516
There's danger to travel at this time,

593
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,310
possibility of death.

594
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:09,776
Well, just as well you weren't listening.

595
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,364
But it could all be coincidence.

596
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,576
I don't see running wild
over some untested theory,

597
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:21,161
at least until we've
heard from Frank Adams.

598
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:24,039
After all, it's his research
project, and not Walt's.

599
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,874
No one can find Frank Adams.

600
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,751
No one was sure the atom bomb would work

601
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:28,960
until they dropped it.

602
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,629
It worked.

603
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,006
Our present problem is

604
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,635
what in God's name do we do now?

605
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:39,305
Well, we warn people.

606
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:43,934
Do we?

607
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,105
Think about it.

608
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,064
A public announcement now

609
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,191
that a major earthquake is imminent,

610
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:56,155
whew, that could create incredible panic.

611
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:57,823
People climbing over people

612
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,949
trying to get out of the city.

613
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,285
That could be a worse disaster
than the quake itself.

614
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,787
But an orderly evacuation

615
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,831
could save hundreds of thousands of lives.

616
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,416
An orderly evacuation to where?

617
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,043
The desert?

618
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,044
The mountains?

619
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,088
How do you feed and shelter

620
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:14,881
four million people in open country?

621
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,425
And suppose we release this information

622
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,510
and there isn't a big quake?

623
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,511
Well, what's the point in learning

624
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:20,470
how to predict an earthquake,

625
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,139
if you don't do anything
about it after you predict it?

626
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Russell!

627
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Russell, look!

628
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,396
Dr. Johnson and I are not cynical.

629
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:31,273
But a false alarm now,
even if it went no further

630
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,775
than the Mayor or the Governor's office,

631
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,194
would destroy the institute's credibility.

632
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,028
Credibil...

633
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:37,863
Look, Russell!

634
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:38,697
Four or five years from now,

635
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,823
we come up with a
foolproof detection system.

636
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,534
Who in authority is gonna believe us then?

637
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,662
Yeah?

638
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,043
No.

639
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,004
No, no, don't call his wife.

640
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,339
I'll take care of it myself.

641
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,178
Frank Adams is dead.

642
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,179
So's young Ward.

643
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,475
They were working in a
trench across the fault.

644
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:08,852
The walls collapsed.

645
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,361
Fiona, get me the Mayor's office.

646
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,114
It's a matter of gravest urgency.

647
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:26,912
See if you can push the blueprint room

648
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:27,996
on those revised drawings

649
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,581
for the Cameron job, will you, Carl?

650
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:30,999
He'll want to see them this afternoon.

651
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,958
Okay, Stewart.

652
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,043
I've got to get out of here for a while.

653
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,921
This place is closing in on me.

654
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,688
Denise, hi.

655
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,690
You finished working already?

656
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,942
Never got started.

657
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:57,943
Would you believe it?

658
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:58,985
The tremor damaged the set,

659
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,238
and they rescheduled
my scene for tomorrow.

660
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,032
So, I thought I'd drop in on Barbara.

661
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,117
Something wrong?

662
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,496
No, I need a drink.

663
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,455
Oh.

664
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,333
Are you one of those solitary drinkers?

665
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:14,835
Not if I can help it.

666
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,212
Would you join me?

667
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,588
Yes.

668
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:19,589
Yes.

669
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:26,263
Do you realize what you're asking of me?

670
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,056
What's really happening with you two?

671
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,684
He's been seeing Brian Marshall's widow.

672
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:31,518
Well, of course.

673
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,978
He feels obligated to help her out.

674
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:33,812
Her and her boy.

675
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,275
Oh, Albert Schweitzer wasn't
that dedicated to mankind.

676
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,026
There's more to it, Remy.

677
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,988
It was Stewart who assigned
Brian that propane cavern job,

678
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,197
and he's been blaming himself

679
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:45,448
for what happened ever since.

680
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,866
Oh, Dad, don't be so naive.

681
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,452
I know they're having an affair.

682
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,331
When you met Stewart,
he was a dirt-poor boy

683
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,666
trying to work his way through college

684
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,002
on an athletic scholarship.

685
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,963
I think you still half see him that way.

686
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,047
But he's a top man now.

687
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,675
He doesn't need me, he
doesn't need anybody.

688
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:04,634
There isn't a firm in town

689
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,220
wouldn't take him on his own terms.

690
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,183
How big a quake?

691
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,230
A seven on the Richter
scale, possibly higher.

692
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:20,066
That could release more than
the total energy generated

693
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,486
by the Hiroshima, Nagasaki
nuclear bombs combined.

694
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,280
If I issue a public warning,

695
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,531
you know what will happen to this city?

696
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,533
Of course we know, that's impossible.

697
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,870
But there are some precautions
you could take, aren't there?

698
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:33,371
Alert the police, the fire department.

699
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,583
Have the Governor mobilize
the National Guard.

700
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,376
Well, he could announce
that it's necessary

701
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,296
to prevent looting at
the Valley quake site.

702
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,089
Well, the police have that situation

703
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,674
totally under control.

704
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,928
Mayor Louis, the next
situation, if it comes,

705
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,098
would be somewhat different.

706
00:39:56,645 --> 00:40:00,858
The Governor and I aren't
even in the same party.

707
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,526
If this turns out to be a false alarm,

708
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:04,903
he'll make me look like the biggest fool

709
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,072
west of the Mississippi.

710
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,698
Second biggest.

711
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,116
I'll top the list.

712
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,831
What do you say, Lou?

713
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:17,665
Hey, Rosa,

714
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:18,500
Hiya, pal.

715
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,918
The ladies room is through that door

716
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:20,919
and a couple of steps to the right.

717
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,505
You still pursuing
those evildoers?

718
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:24,590
Not as hard as usual.

719
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,133
Hey, Jay,
we want a couple of burgers

720
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,260
and some orange juice to go.

721
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,347
Two burgers and
orange juice to go.

722
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,057
The 50 bucks, Miles.

723
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,434
You owed me for three weeks.

724
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:37,352
Hey, listen, man.

725
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,686
What if I pay you tomorrow.

726
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:39,521
Okay?

727
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:40,772
Hey, the 50.

728
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,901
You're a great bike rider
but a lousy pool shooter.

729
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:46,486
Officer, I mean,

730
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,738
you're not gonna let him
get away with this, are you?

731
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:49,989
Yes.

732
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,159
50 bucks, or I'll break your back.

733
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,787
Peter Fonda.

734
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:56,788
Hey, hey, Sal.

735
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:57,789
Hey, wait.

736
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,419
Here.

737
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,253
Take it.

738
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:04,087
Yeah, I'll take it.

739
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,755
Thanks.

740
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:06,756
Brother.

741
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,925
Miles, what're you doing?

742
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,512
All I've got is a dollar
and some loose change on me.

743
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,972
Hey, Lou, hey, come on.

744
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:14,806
Lend me 10 bucks, huh?

745
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,975
I don't have time to go to the bank.

746
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,853
You better stop breathing
those gas fumes so much.

747
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,896
Hey, listen, Lou, this
is an emergency, man.

748
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,649
We need a butane tank for the stunt.

749
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:27,735
I'll have it back to you tomorrow.

750
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,736
I promise.

751
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:31,114
Come on, Lou.

752
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,824
This is really important to me.

753
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:33,867
This big guy is coming down

754
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,369
from one of the big Vegas
hotels to see this act.

755
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,913
Now, there has never ever
been anything like this.

756
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,040
If that hotel sponsors us, man,

757
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:44,669
I could wind up on ABC's
Wide World of Sports, man.

758
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,464
And after that, you can
forget about Evel Knievel.

759
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:51,092
It'll be just the Miles Quade Story.

760
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,927
You know, I'm sorry I
ever arrested you two.

761
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,638
I've been paying for it ever since.

762
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:00,977
Hello.

763
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,687
Rosa, I want you to meet Lou Slade.

764
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,063
He's the cop who flattened Miles and I

765
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:07,442
with a blackjack at the North
Hollywood rally last year.

766
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:08,776
Hey, that's right.

767
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,570
And we didn't even start that ruckus.

768
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,697
Well, you should've knocked
their brains into place.

769
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,531
Come here, Rosa.

770
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,365
I want to talk to you.

771
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,200
Come here.

772
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:16,034
Listen.

773
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:16,868
If I had the bread,

774
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,995
I would hire a beautiful,
sexy broad this afternoon,

775
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:21,414
and I would kick your all the way home.

776
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:22,790
Well, I don't need your help.

777
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,625
Bye.

778
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,793
Now, Rosa, will you listen to me?

779
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,629
Daredevil motorcyclists
always have to have

780
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,464
beautiful, sexy broads hanging around.

781
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,298
Rosa, that's right.

782
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:31,132
What do you want,

783
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:32,091
us to look like phonies or what?

784
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,636
Sal, I'm your sister.

785
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,553
What about Maureen?

786
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,387
She's your girlfriend.

787
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,222
Come on, Rosa.

788
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,516
Maureen is too flat-chested.

789
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:46,523
Rosa, come here.

790
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:49,902
Now, Rosa, I want you to show
the officer your T-shirt.

791
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,154
Oh, yeah, Lou, take a look at this.

792
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,240
We're gonna have 20, maybe 30,000 of these

793
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,699
made up after the Vegas show.

794
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,534
Go ahead, take a look.

795
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:01,455
See what you think of it.

796
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,547
I think it's beautiful.

797
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,310
My wife will ask me,
is she pretty?

798
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,729
And I'll say, quite.

799
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,607
And she'll say, something
like, that figures.

800
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,733
Tell me about her.

801
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,403
And you'll say, nothing much to tell.

802
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:34,404
We just had a drink.

803
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:38,408
And she'll ask me, no small talk?

804
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:39,867
Very little.

805
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:42,328
A trait that goes with engineering.

806
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:43,581
Yeah, maybe it does.

807
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,256
It's good.

808
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:01,598
Can I ask you something?

809
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,599
Sure.

810
00:44:03,267 --> 00:44:04,267
Anything.

811
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,187
When we made love,

812
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:14,111
when you made love to
me, it was with such,

813
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,531
such, I'm trying to think
of exactly the right word.

814
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:19,742
It was with such

815
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:22,535
anger.

816
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:24,954
Anger?

817
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:25,955
Yeah, anger.

818
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,083
Did I anger you?

819
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
No.

820
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,422
I think you are absolutely lovely.

821
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:35,674
Well, I think so, too.

822
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:37,675
I'm not hurt.

823
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:42,972
Tell me, how long has
Barbara worked at the office?

824
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:45,726
Oh, 10, 12 years.

825
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:50,898
Well, did you ever know me
to drop in on her before?

826
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,107
No.

827
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:54,668
Certainly not since you got back to LA.

828
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,821
Well, maybe I didn't
want to see Barbara.

829
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,158
Maybe I wanted to see you.

830
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:02,909
Hmm?

831
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,910
How about that?

832
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,913
Yeah, how about that?

833
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:08,332
So, you didn't seduce me.

834
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I seduced you.

835
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,419
Great.

836
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:17,800
Well, next time I'll do the honors.

837
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,511
Oh, don't feel there
has to be a next time.

838
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:25,140
Don't think that you just
made a lifelong commitment.

839
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:29,769
Come here.

840
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,271
Why?

841
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:34,607
Come here.

842
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:38,236
I have to go to Oregon this summer.

843
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:40,322
All summer on a hydroelectric project.

844
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,867
Come up there, with Corry.

845
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:46,703
I'll rent a house for the two of you.

846
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:50,165
It's such beautiful,
really beautiful country.

847
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,750
It'd be great for him.

848
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,335
Please.

849
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:55,379
I'll think about it.

850
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:00,050
I'll come back tonight.

851
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:04,930
I'll think about that, too.

852
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:17,525
We interrupt our regular program

853
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:19,527
to bring you a special bulletin.

854
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:20,778
The Governor has just announced

855
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,405
that the following National Guard units

856
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:25,116
have been put on emergency
active duty status.

857
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:27,160
The Fourth Infantry support group,

858
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,079
the 227th Heavy Transport Battalion,

859
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,290
the 112th Headquarters Company,

860
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,250
the 33rd Communications Battalion,

861
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,295
the 47th Engineers Company.

862
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,590
Let me show you What's happening.

863
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,175
First of all, we start up there.

864
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,468
Then it's down that ramp,

865
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,303
like hell into that first big loop,

866
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,680
up this ramp, zoom over the truck,

867
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:50,516
down this ramp and straight
into that big figure eight.

868
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,019
Then it's down that ramp
right into that fire ring.

869
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,646
Now, that fire ring doesn't
just have flames on the outside,

870
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,190
like in your dog acts.

871
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:58,900
No, no, we rigged those gas jets

872
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:01,027
to shoot flames right in the center.

873
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:02,945
Then it's down that ramp, over that pit,

874
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,697
and we're home free.

875
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,532
Now, you take a guy like Knievel.

876
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,702
Now, he'll jump 20, maybe 30 cars,

877
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:11,579
and call it a big thing.

878
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:14,457
But, baby, let me tell you something,

879
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,292
compared to those,

880
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:19,420
landing on a roof of a
car at 100 miles an hour,

881
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,130
that's like landing in a water bed.

882
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,386
Miles, you're out of your mind.

883
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,304
Hey, but, Rosa, wait a minute.

884
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,180
No, no way.

885
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:30,264
If you want to help your best
friend kill himself, fine.

886
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:31,766
Rosa, listen, now, listen.

887
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:32,600
Don't be rotten.

888
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:33,684
There's nothing to it.

889
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:34,560
It is simple!

890
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,604
Who do you think you're kidding?

891
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:37,897
I'm going to a movie.

892
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:40,150
I'm going home to change
into some fresh duds.

893
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,610
Ciao.

894
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,111
You're gonna fix it up.

895
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:44,946
You're gonna fix it up.

896
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:45,988
All right, all right, all right.

897
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:46,823
She's nervous.

898
00:47:46,824 --> 00:47:47,865
She's...

899
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,116
Yeah, sure.

900
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,339
Just a minute.

901
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,512
Oh, hello.

902
00:50:14,513 --> 00:50:15,596
Hi.

903
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:17,223
Oh, I'm sorry, I was
going to pay you tomorrow>

904
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:18,057
Come in and I'll get...

905
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:18,891
Oh, no, no, no.

906
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:21,852
Miss Amici, that's not
what I came here for.

907
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:22,687
You didn't?

908
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:23,854
No, there's been an emergency.

909
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,272
The National Guard's been called up

910
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,900
and I have to report in for duty.

911
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,404
I mean, after that second tremor,

912
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:33,781
I wanted to make sure that you were okay.

913
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:34,615
Sure.

914
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:35,951
Sure, I'm fine, why not?

915
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:43,541
Well, come in and see for yourself.

916
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:44,542
Oh, thank you.

917
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:49,922
I never seem to find
time to clean this dump.

918
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:51,090
I'll be glad to give you a hand.

919
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:52,258
No thanks.

920
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,385
Sit down.

921
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:08,816
Oh, it's my brothers idea.

922
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:11,445
It's sort of an advertising
gimmick for his business.

923
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:20,619
Say, um,

924
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:22,622
how did you know where I live?

925
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:24,707
Well, I followed you home at night

926
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,126
just to make sure you got home safely.

927
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,461
You gotta be kidding.

928
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:29,295
No, no.

929
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,839
Somebody as pretty as you
needs to be looked after.

930
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,007
Don't you worry about a thing.

931
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,800
I'm gonna take care of you.

932
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,093
Are you for real?

933
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:39,055
My family doesn't even worry about me.

934
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:40,307
I can take care of myself.

935
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,940
You know, you're not
very neat, Miss Amici.

936
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:52,527
Bet then again, my mother wasn't either.

937
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,743
Look, uh, I was gonna go to a movie.

938
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:01,745
You wanna go with me?

939
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,041
That is if you've got time.

940
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,044
No, I've got official
business to take care of.

941
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:16,218
Besides you shouldn't be going
out so much alone anyway.

942
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:20,054
Now listen, you stay right here.

943
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,097
I have to report for duty,

944
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:23,432
then I'll be back to look after you.

945
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,391
You believe me, Miss Amici.

946
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,645
I know exactly what's best for you.

947
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,065
You just stay right here, okay?

948
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:39,949
Bye-bye, now.

949
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:21,866
How about a lift?

950
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:25,828
You and that bike can
take a lift outta here.

951
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:54,107
Hey, give me a hand here.

952
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,238
It's gonna be rough to
get this one under control.

953
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,240
What a terrible sight.

954
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,074
What do you mean terrible?

955
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:04,909
It's not terrible.

956
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,910
It's beautiful.

957
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,554
We're probably gonna have more fires

958
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:26,764
from the aftershocks.

959
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:29,476
Oh, I hope not.

960
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:35,856
Where's them cantaloupes?

961
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:37,816
We asked you for some
free cantaloupes, Jody.

962
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,027
Say, my friend, what
kind of friend are you?

963
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,779
Still playing soldier boy, Jody?

964
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,613
That's right.

965
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:43,447
We saw on television

966
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:45,366
where you're gonna go play soldier boy.

967
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:47,327
Say, say, say, say, say, say.

968
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:23,071
Is it true that blondes have more fun?

969
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:26,532
Oh, no.

970
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:27,533
Look at that.

971
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:32,997
Fall in!

972
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:33,956
Hey, yo.

973
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:36,875
Left, right, left, right.

974
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,502
Let's decorate the warrior.

975
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:49,805
Eyes straight to the front, soldier.

976
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:50,806
Quit looking around.

977
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:02,651
Now the motion in this
model was programmed

978
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:06,363
from the actual recorded ground
motion of a 6.2 earthquake.

979
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:07,990
Long Beach in '33.

980
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,326
Now, a magnitude of eight
would produce a motion...

981
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:11,869
What's your point?

982
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,495
Bill, we live in an earthquake zone.

983
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:15,289
What can I tell you?

984
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,290
That I've failed to meet

985
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,083
city or state safety requirements?

986
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,335
That's not the point.

987
00:56:19,336 --> 00:56:21,170
I think we should go beyond the codes.

988
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:23,088
You remember the Sylmar quake.

989
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,633
A lot of buildings that
met the code collapsed.

990
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,054
I thought you were gonna chew me out

991
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,014
for leaning on Bill Cameron.

992
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:33,682
Oh, I just figured it was time

993
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:35,059
I kicked myself upstairs.

994
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,812
And I always like the feel of that name,

995
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:39,772
Chairman of the Board.

996
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:40,773
Has a nice ring.

997
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,443
Congratulations, Mr. President.

998
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,571
Thanks, Sam.

999
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:49,448
Oh, listen.

1000
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:50,449
You're gonna have to

1001
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:53,160
forget about that Oregon project, I guess.

1002
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:54,828
We can't have a new company president

1003
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:56,830
pouring cement out in the woods somewhere.

1004
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,165
What's the matter?

1005
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,583
Look, I just promoted you.

1006
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:00,918
I didn't fire you.

1007
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:04,588
No, Sam, you're gonna figure I'm crazy,

1008
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:09,010
but I'd like a little
time to think this over.

1009
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:11,762
Okay.

1010
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:17,101
Any problems I ought to know about?

1011
00:57:17,102 --> 00:57:19,853
No, just a few priorities

1012
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,940
I've got to get straight in my head.

1013
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,483
Sure.

1014
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,484
Sam,

1015
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,031
Remy didn't have anything
to do with this, did she?

1016
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:32,116
Don't worry.

1017
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,953
You'd have this job even if
you weren't my son-in-law.

1018
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,299
Oh, hold that.

1019
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:50,843
Hello?

1020
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:52,010
Hello, Denise?

1021
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,303
Stewart.

1022
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:54,346
Hi.

1023
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:56,306
Look, I'm not gonna be
able to make it tonight.

1024
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,642
Something important came up at work.

1025
00:57:58,643 --> 00:57:59,560
Any trouble?

1026
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:00,727
No, no trouble.

1027
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,480
I've just got a problem to solve.

1028
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,023
I'm sorry.

1029
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:06,608
I'm sorrier than you are.

1030
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,194
Oh, it doesn't matter about tonight.

1031
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,824
We'll have lots of time
together up in Oregon.

1032
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,908
Okay?

1033
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,618
Bye-bye.

1034
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,705
Goodbye.

1035
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:20,706
Mom?

1036
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,083
Mom.

1037
00:58:25,462 --> 00:58:26,545
Yeah?

1038
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,046
Okay if I go to the playground?

1039
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:28,881
Sure.

1040
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:31,425
Just be careful crossing that bridge, huh?

1041
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:34,970
And, Corry, if I'm not home
when you get back, don't worry.

1042
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:36,430
I might take a walk later.

1043
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:38,141
If leave the kitchen door unlocked.

1044
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,065
I think I'll make a practice run.

1045
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,194
Loosen up the machine.

1046
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:18,222
All right, Sal.

1047
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:26,021
Miles!

1048
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,444
Miles, you all right?

1049
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:34,029
Huh?

1050
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,490
Came out of that damn thing.

1051
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,033
What happened?

1052
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:38,867
Huh?

1053
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:39,868
Come on, help me try again.

1054
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,245
Listen to me, Miles.

1055
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:42,329
We only have one 250 left.

1056
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,163
You understand me?

1057
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:44,373
Huh?

1058
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:45,207
What're you talking about, man?

1059
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,041
I gotta try it again!

1060
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:46,875
Okay.

1061
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:47,709
Okay, you're the boss.

1062
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,253
Come on.

1063
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:54,174
All right, Miles, come on, baby.

1064
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:55,133
Come on, come on!

1065
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:59,889
Let her roll!

1066
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:26,791
Delay in the contract, I suggest,

1067
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:29,167
Barbara.

1068
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,002
Mmm-hmm?

1069
01:00:30,003 --> 01:00:31,712
You knew Brian Marshall?

1070
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:33,046
Yes.

1071
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:34,090
Ever meet his wife?

1072
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:37,010
Sure, we see each other all the time.

1073
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,722
What's she like?

1074
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:44,516
She's a very nice girl.

1075
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:46,101
Yes, I was afraid of that.

1076
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,229
Yes?

1077
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,272
Mr. Royce, your daughter's

1078
01:00:50,273 --> 01:00:51,773
on the way into your office.

1079
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:53,859
Fine.

1080
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,860
Remy.

1081
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,156
Good afternoon, Mrs. Graff.

1082
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,157
Hello, Barbara.

1083
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:02,744
Have you spoken to Stewart yet?

1084
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,871
Yes.

1085
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:07,498
He said he wanted to think about it.

1086
01:01:12,879 --> 01:01:14,296
Los Angeles approach.

1087
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:16,590
This is ASP-153.

1088
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:17,592
Do you read me?

1089
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,303
This is Los Angeles approach.

1090
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,263
Go ahead ASP-153.

1091
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:28,227
ASP-153, go miles northeast at 10,000.

1092
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:29,646
BFR on time.

1093
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,189
Request landing information.

1094
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,191
Roger, ASP-153.

1095
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:37,027
Use runway two five left.

1096
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:39,112
Wind, 15 knots.

1097
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:42,616
You are number two,
following the world's 747.

1098
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:46,370
Maintain present heading and
altitude to intercept the ILS.

1099
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:48,664
Upon intercepting the ILS,

1100
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:50,374
you are cleared for approach.

1101
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,335
Report on outer marker, please.

1102
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:54,753
Roger.

1103
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:05,847
Miles, here he comes now.

1104
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:06,765
The guy from Vegas.

1105
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:07,599
Oh, baby.

1106
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,309
This is gonna be the
greatest run of my life.

1107
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,852
I'm tuned to just the right pitch.

1108
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:33,083
Now, you go on home and put
this right out of your mind.

1109
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:34,084
You look exhausted.

1110
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:38,338
Thanks, Dad.

1111
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:39,339
Sam, I,

1112
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,633
hello, Remy.

1113
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:48,433
Well, I guess you've got
yourself a new president.

1114
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:51,017
Great!

1115
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:53,271
And you'll stay away
from that Marshall woman?

1116
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:01,445
Stewart.

1117
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:03,613
Stewart, wait.

1118
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,951
Stewart, where are you going?

1119
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:09,411
Anywhere.

1120
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:10,412
A bar.

1121
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:13,081
Why are you so angry?

1122
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:14,291
Remy, don't you understand?

1123
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,250
That was a bribe.

1124
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:16,376
Another bribe!

1125
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:18,462
Our whole marriage has
been a series of bribes.

1126
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:19,671
And you took them.

1127
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:21,631
Well, it's time I quit.

1128
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:53,039
I'm not that stupid.

1129
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,410
Please fasten your seatbelts.

1130
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:35,832
We are now approaching Los
Angeles International Airport.

1131
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,125
I hope you had a pleasant flight.

1132
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:41,837
Enjoy your stay in Los Angeles.

1133
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:43,672
Please remain in your
seats until the plane

1134
01:04:43,673 --> 01:04:45,132
has come to a complete stop.

1135
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,509
Don't forget to check your luggage

1136
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:51,012
in the compartment above
and under your seat.

1137
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,013
Thank you.

1138
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:59,605
LAX tower, this is ASP-153
on the outer marker, inbound.

1139
01:05:00,523 --> 01:05:02,023
Roger, ASP-153.

1140
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,861
You are clear to land
on runway two five left.

1141
01:05:05,987 --> 01:05:06,820
Roger.

1142
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:08,990
Clear to land on two five left.

1143
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:17,789
Max.

1144
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:20,208
Hey.

1145
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:21,251
Finally found the trouble.

1146
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:23,086
I guess the earthquake busted the conduit

1147
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:28,050
and it's flooded the bottom of the shaft.

1148
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:34,282
Get down!

1149
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,477
Holy mother of God!

1150
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:34,981
Help me!

1151
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:36,024
Oh, God, help me!

1152
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:37,317
Help!

1153
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:38,318
What is she doing?

1154
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:42,822
What's happening?

1155
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:47,845
Tony!

1156
01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:03,278
ASP-153, go around, go around,

1157
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:04,822
runway breaking up.

1158
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,213
One, five, hold that.

1159
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:28,845
162.

1160
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,190
270.

1161
01:12:54,872 --> 01:12:55,872
175.

1162
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,930
Come on.

1163
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:19,812
Next Sunday night
on The Big Event,

1164
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:22,733
NBC will present part two of Earthquake.

1165
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,606
Jim, Stewart Graff.

1166
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:33,482
She's done it again.

1167
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:37,446
Now jut get over here, will ya?

1168
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:48,122
Oh, oh my God!

1169
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:49,123
Oh!

1170
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:57,173
Fred!

1171
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,020
Fred!

1172
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:13,064
Fred!

1173
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,149
Fred?

1174
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,029
Russell, this is very interesting.

1175
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,740
You forecast an earthquake in
the three to four point range

1176
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:23,908
this morning.

1177
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:25,951
We had an earthquake in the
three to four point range

1178
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:27,286
this morning.

1179
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:28,621
I'm impressed.

1180
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,955
Thank you, sir.

1181
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:32,291
However, isn't it rather
slender evidence

1182
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,460
for predicting a catastrophe?

1183
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,193
How big a quake?

1184
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:02,781
A seven on the Richter
scale, possibly higher.

1185
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,784
That could release more
than the total energy

1186
01:19:06,785 --> 01:19:10,455
generated by the Hiroshima,
Nagasaki nuclear bombs combined.

1187
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:13,541
Hey, yeah, Lou, take a look at this.

1188
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:15,584
We're gonna have 20, maybe
30,000 of these made up

1189
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,086
after the Vegas show.

1190
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:21,716
Go ahead, take a look,
see what you think of it.

1191
01:19:21,717 --> 01:19:22,926
I think it's beautiful.

1192
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:32,893
Could I ask you something?

1193
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:35,021
Sure, anything.

1194
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:39,525
When we made love,

1195
01:19:41,653 --> 01:19:42,863
when you made love to me,

1196
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:45,449
it was with such,

1197
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:49,827
such, I'm trying to think
of exactly the right word.

1198
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:51,079
It was with such

1199
01:19:52,748 --> 01:19:53,748
anger.

1200
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:56,292
Anger?

1201
01:19:56,293 --> 01:19:57,293
Yeah, anger.

1202
01:19:59,129 --> 01:20:00,129
Did I anger you?

1203
01:20:01,256 --> 01:20:02,256
No.

1204
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:04,760
I think you are absolutely lovely.

1205
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,846
That wasn't there before the tremor.

1206
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:10,014
I know every inch of this dam.

1207
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:10,848
It's a new one.

1208
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:11,932
Max, I'm a trained technician.

1209
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:12,892
You're a watchman.

1210
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:14,518
Now stop trying to teach me my business.

1211
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:15,728
It wasn't there.

1212
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:17,396
There's no such thing as solid concrete

1213
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:18,981
and you know it.

1214
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,733
You will have three children.

1215
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:22,318
Ace of diamonds.

1216
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:24,111
You have strong character,

1217
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:25,780
insist on having your own way.

1218
01:20:25,781 --> 01:20:26,948
Boy, that fits you.

1219
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:29,200
Hmmm.

1220
01:20:29,201 --> 01:20:31,118
There's danger to travel at this time.

1221
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,538
Possibility of death.

1222
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:40,669
Oh, hello.

1223
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,504
Hi.

1224
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:42,338
Oh, I'm sorry.

1225
01:20:42,339 --> 01:20:43,422
I was gonna pay you tomorrow.

1226
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:44,256
Come in and I'll get it.

1227
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:45,090
Oh, no, no, no.

1228
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:48,010
Miss Amici, that's not
what I came here for.

1229
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:49,637
You didn't?

1230
01:20:49,638 --> 01:20:51,096
I mean after that second tremor,

1231
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:53,098
I wanted to make sure that you were okay.

1232
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,350
Sure.

1233
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:55,519
Sure, I'm fine, why not?

1234
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:59,523
Well, I guess you got
yourself a new president.

1235
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:02,024
Great.

1236
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:04,820
And you'll stay away
from the Marshall woman.

1237
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:11,325
Why are you so angry?

1238
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:12,493
Remy, don't you understand?

1239
01:21:12,494 --> 01:21:14,078
That was a bribe, another bribe.

1240
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:16,705
Our whole marriage has
been a series of bribes.

1241
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,082
And you took them.

1242
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:23,046
Well, it's time I quit.

1243
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,562
Tony!

1244
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:15,324
ASP-153, go around, go around.

1245
01:23:15,325 --> 01:23:16,910
Runway breaking up.

1246
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,857
Please help me.

1247
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:51,336
Where's the door?

1248
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:56,675
Somebody's gotta get us outta here.

1249
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:57,886
Help!

1250
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:26,539
Mother, help me up!

1251
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:28,665
Mother!

1252
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:30,459
Mother!

1253
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:32,127
Mother!

1254
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:39,384
Mother!

1255
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:46,226
Hey, Al, give me a hand.

1256
01:25:49,938 --> 01:25:51,481
Come on, over here!

1257
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:27,934
Turn off the gas!

1258
01:27:08,141 --> 01:27:09,142
Oh, my God!

1259
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:12,936
Stay here.

1260
01:27:17,775 --> 01:27:18,818
Help.

1261
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:27,659
Is there a doctor around here?

1262
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:33,665
Barbara, Barbara!

1263
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:34,499
Barbara!

1264
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,793
Mr. Cameron threw me
out of the elevator.

1265
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:40,506
And then I heard all
those people screaming!

1266
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:50,599
All right, take it easy, everybody.

1267
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,808
It's over now.

1268
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:53,435
It's over.

1269
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:54,269
Over here.

1270
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,395
Take care of it.

1271
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,105
Ben, get the first aid kits over there.

1272
01:27:57,106 --> 01:27:59,858
All right, all right, now
listen to me, everybody.

1273
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:01,276
Let's just settle down.

1274
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:03,195
The worst is over, do you understand?

1275
01:28:03,196 --> 01:28:04,613
The worst is over.

1276
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:05,656
Hey!

1277
01:28:18,086 --> 01:28:19,169
Break the windows.

1278
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,087
Break the windows!

1279
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:21,714
Come on, over there!

1280
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:30,681
It's not safe here!

1281
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:33,767
You gotta get, come on, get out of here.

1282
01:28:33,768 --> 01:28:35,061
Get out of here!

1283
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:42,317
Whoa, all right.

1284
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:44,612
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

1285
01:28:46,781 --> 01:28:47,990
Come on.

1286
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:49,951
Don't slow down!

1287
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:53,370
No stairs!

1288
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:57,559
Corry!

1289
01:30:03,608 --> 01:30:04,608
Corry?

1290
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,285
Calling Van Nuys.

1291
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:16,620
Calling Van Nuys.

1292
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:17,746
We really got problems.

1293
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:19,831
Thank God we had mobile units to bring in.

1294
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,083
Let's get to the control panel.

1295
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:23,335
Fires out of control,
Van Nuys Hospital,

1296
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:27,298
all roads blocked between
Victory and Kittridge.

1297
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,931
Is there any way I can
broadcast to the whole city,

1298
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:37,724
get picked up on transistor sets?

1299
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,226
There's a few commercial stations

1300
01:30:39,227 --> 01:30:40,811
on the quake fringe area still operating.

1301
01:30:40,812 --> 01:30:43,605
We might be able to rig a
microwave relay to one of them.

1302
01:30:43,606 --> 01:30:45,273
Well, get on it, then.

1303
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:47,776
Hey, you, come here.

1304
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:50,070
Help, damn it!

1305
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:51,447
Slide him out from under there.

1306
01:30:54,117 --> 01:30:57,662
Hey, who do you have to know
to get a drink around here?

1307
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,295
Shut off that gas valve.

1308
01:31:07,797 --> 01:31:09,131
Help me.

1309
01:31:09,132 --> 01:31:11,675
Help me.

1310
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:18,683
Help me.

1311
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,017
You guys, check that edge.

1312
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:22,018
Both sides.

1313
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:23,019
You two, check up here.

1314
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,146
Both sides.

1315
01:31:24,147 --> 01:31:26,022
Couple of guys down below.

1316
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:27,858
It held.

1317
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:29,234
My God, it held.

1318
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:30,235
How much longer?

1319
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:33,155
I'm gonna divert some
water into the spillways.

1320
01:31:33,156 --> 01:31:34,823
We gotta cut down on the pressure.

1321
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:37,076
Not Without official
permission, you're not.

1322
01:31:53,301 --> 01:31:54,301
It's dead.

1323
01:31:57,513 --> 01:31:59,389
I told you to leave that alone.

1324
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:01,391
The city's gonna need every
drop of water it can get.

1325
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:03,560
There's dozens of fires
down there already.

1326
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:05,187
If this dam busts,
there won't be nothing

1327
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:08,398
between here and Wilshire
Boulevard left to burn.

1328
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:10,567
The quake may have
broken something inside.

1329
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:16,781
It won't budge.

1330
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:19,826
It won't budge.

1331
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,040
Gotta get outta here!

1332
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:32,464
Stewart,
you'd better get out of here.

1333
01:32:32,465 --> 01:32:34,966
The whole building is full of phosgene.

1334
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:35,967
You'd better get out, too.

1335
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,260
Maybe there's some way

1336
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:39,263
down through an elevator shaft.

1337
01:32:58,658 --> 01:33:01,826
Shut the door.

1338
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,381
It's giving.

1339
01:33:14,382 --> 01:33:15,382
I've got it.

1340
01:33:18,928 --> 01:33:19,928
Shut it.

1341
01:33:25,726 --> 01:33:28,521
Get me, Get me a chair, with arms.

1342
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:37,445
All right, put it down there.

1343
01:33:42,785 --> 01:33:44,286
Pull it all the way.

1344
01:33:44,287 --> 01:33:46,079
Here, hold this.

1345
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:54,588
All right, pull the chair.

1346
01:33:54,589 --> 01:33:57,507
Hold it up here.

1347
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:02,554
We need something
flexible to strap 'em in.

1348
01:34:02,555 --> 01:34:03,555
Pantyhose.

1349
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:07,684
Barbara, take off your pantyhose, damn it.

1350
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:08,685
You, too.

1351
01:34:08,686 --> 01:34:09,519
Come on.

1352
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,564
Take off your pantyhose.

1353
01:34:12,565 --> 01:34:13,565
Get it out.

1354
01:34:19,322 --> 01:34:20,322
Here's one.

1355
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,993
Here comes the first one.

1356
01:34:24,952 --> 01:34:26,912
Let her down as slow as you can.

1357
01:34:37,882 --> 01:34:40,050
And keep down the sway.

1358
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:41,051
Steady.

1359
01:34:54,148 --> 01:34:54,981
It's okay.

1360
01:34:54,982 --> 01:34:57,484
You made it.

1361
01:34:57,485 --> 01:34:58,360
There.

1362
01:34:58,361 --> 01:35:01,989
It's all right now.

1363
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:26,681
Now, let me give it another shot.

1364
01:35:30,434 --> 01:35:31,894
Now, try it again.

1365
01:35:35,731 --> 01:35:37,232
Yeah, yeah!

1366
01:35:40,111 --> 01:35:41,361
You guys owe me a six-pack.

1367
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:42,362
You got it.

1368
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:52,539
Corry!

1369
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:52,807
Corry, sweetie.

1370
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:53,683
All right.

1371
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:54,684
Okay.

1372
01:36:55,644 --> 01:36:56,644
I'll get you out.

1373
01:37:00,316 --> 01:37:03,151
Okay, it's going to be all right.

1374
01:37:03,152 --> 01:37:04,528
I'll lift you up.

1375
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:06,446
Okay, try.

1376
01:37:30,262 --> 01:37:31,262
Help!

1377
01:37:34,016 --> 01:37:34,891
I don't believe it.

1378
01:37:34,892 --> 01:37:36,351
I don't believe it.

1379
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:37,477
What do you mean?

1380
01:37:37,478 --> 01:37:38,478
Busted!

1381
01:37:39,605 --> 01:37:42,941
The ramps are busted,
the loops are busted,

1382
01:37:42,942 --> 01:37:44,652
the rings are busted.

1383
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:48,822
I hope to God Evel
Knievel was in town today.

1384
01:37:48,823 --> 01:37:49,823
Why?

1385
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:52,367
Huh?

1386
01:37:56,205 --> 01:37:57,497
Help!

1387
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,876
Please, help me!

1388
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:02,877
Help!

1389
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:06,589
Help!

1390
01:38:07,466 --> 01:38:08,716
Help!

1391
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:10,010
Here, down here!

1392
01:38:16,225 --> 01:38:17,058
Help me.

1393
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:17,892
My son is hurt.

1394
01:38:17,893 --> 01:38:18,726
Help us.

1395
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:20,104
- Huh?
- Come on.

1396
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:29,363
Okay.

1397
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:34,784
Take it easy, lady.

1398
01:38:34,785 --> 01:38:35,618
Yeah.

1399
01:38:35,619 --> 01:38:37,203
Come on, push him up here.

1400
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:39,081
Push him up here, lady.

1401
01:38:43,127 --> 01:38:44,127
Slowly.

1402
01:38:44,837 --> 01:38:46,170
Got him?

1403
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,005
Got him?

1404
01:38:47,006 --> 01:38:49,048
Yeah, I got him.

1405
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:50,551
Careful.

1406
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:56,306
Stay right there and watch those wires.

1407
01:38:56,307 --> 01:39:01,144
It'll be hours before we
drain off enough to do any good.

1408
01:39:27,296 --> 01:39:28,296
Help!

1409
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,840
Help me.

1410
01:39:37,097 --> 01:39:39,682
Hold on, lady.

1411
01:39:39,683 --> 01:39:40,516
Help me.

1412
01:39:40,517 --> 01:39:42,478
Hold on, lady.

1413
01:39:58,494 --> 01:39:59,577
Miles, put him right here.

1414
01:39:59,578 --> 01:40:01,288
Here we go.

1415
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:05,041
Where are we gonna take him, huh?

1416
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:07,251
There's no hospital for miles.

1417
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,295
I guess we better head
for the police station.

1418
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:10,129
Yeah.

1419
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:13,132
Yeah, let's go.

1420
01:40:24,395 --> 01:40:25,645
How can I find out
about my daughter?

1421
01:40:25,646 --> 01:40:27,105
She's in County Hospital.

1422
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:27,939
My store.

1423
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:28,773
The whole front is gone.

1424
01:40:28,774 --> 01:40:29,607
You've got to help me protect it.

1425
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:30,441
Why aren't the firemen here yet?

1426
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:32,193
Please, help me find a doctor.

1427
01:40:32,194 --> 01:40:33,277
My husband's legs are broken.

1428
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:34,612
Stop!

1429
01:40:34,613 --> 01:40:36,406
You're all gonna have to help yourselves.

1430
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:38,032
Most of the police in
this district were killed

1431
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:39,158
in that station house.

1432
01:40:39,159 --> 01:40:41,327
And the guys that were on
patrol when the quake hit,

1433
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:43,621
well, they probably got more
to do than they can handle.

1434
01:40:43,622 --> 01:40:46,124
Now, look, you get as many
volunteers as you can.

1435
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:47,834
Go to that hardware store over there.

1436
01:40:47,835 --> 01:40:49,210
Now, if it's locked, break in.

1437
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:51,170
Find as many picks and shovels as you can.

1438
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,506
And start looking for
people who are buried alive.

1439
01:40:53,507 --> 01:40:54,841
There are plenty of 'em, believe me.

1440
01:40:54,842 --> 01:40:56,718
Give him a hand.

1441
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,513
Move it!

1442
01:41:04,309 --> 01:41:05,768
Now, I want all the women and the kids

1443
01:41:05,769 --> 01:41:07,687
who have houses in any
kind of shape at all,

1444
01:41:07,688 --> 01:41:09,397
to go to them and to stay there.

1445
01:41:09,398 --> 01:41:11,607
Now, turn off all the gas lines...

1446
01:41:11,608 --> 01:41:12,608
Hey, I'm getting something.

1447
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:14,569
Ladies and gentlemen,
stand by for a message

1448
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:16,738
from the Mayor of Los Angeles.

1449
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:19,532
This city has suffered the
greatest natural disaster

1450
01:41:19,533 --> 01:41:21,285
in the history of the United States.

1451
01:41:22,286 --> 01:41:25,039
The state and the nation
are rallying to our aid.

1452
01:41:25,998 --> 01:41:30,460
But for the next few hours,
until massive help can reach us,

1453
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:31,836
we will have to depend

1454
01:41:31,837 --> 01:41:35,715
on our own physical and
spiritual resources.

1455
01:41:35,716 --> 01:41:38,051
Private physicians should report

1456
01:41:38,052 --> 01:41:39,761
to emergency aid stations,

1457
01:41:39,762 --> 01:41:43,723
now being set up at key
sites throughout the city.

1458
01:41:43,724 --> 01:41:46,267
Bring all the medical
supplies you can carry.

1459
01:41:46,268 --> 01:41:49,604
Clinics have been established
in the following locations,

1460
01:41:49,605 --> 01:41:52,982
the Hollywood Bowl, the
Occidental Insurance building,

1461
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:54,026
the Wilson Plaza...

1462
01:41:55,152 --> 01:41:56,152
Laura!

1463
01:41:56,153 --> 01:41:57,487
Laura, my father?

1464
01:41:57,488 --> 01:41:59,822
Is he all right?

1465
01:41:59,823 --> 01:42:01,824
My father!

1466
01:42:01,825 --> 01:42:03,659
Laura, my father!

1467
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:06,788
God!

1468
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:07,663
Go on.

1469
01:42:07,664 --> 01:42:09,749
Come on, you're next.

1470
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:10,750
Move.

1471
01:42:56,797 --> 01:42:59,841
You all right?

1472
01:43:22,281 --> 01:43:26,492
Sam, why didn't you go ahead
of some of the younger guys?

1473
01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:28,370
Staying up here was crazy.

1474
01:43:34,668 --> 01:43:35,501
I don't think I'm strong enough

1475
01:43:35,502 --> 01:43:36,919
to lower you all the way by myself.

1476
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,130
So, get ready for a jolt.

1477
01:44:09,536 --> 01:44:10,536
Oh!

1478
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:56,332
Let's get out of here.

1479
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:58,751
Give me your hand, will you?

1480
01:44:58,752 --> 01:44:59,585
Watch yourself.

1481
01:44:59,586 --> 01:45:00,586
Okay.

1482
01:45:02,214 --> 01:45:03,214
Easy.

1483
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:09,428
Do you know Denise Marshall, Barbara?

1484
01:45:09,429 --> 01:45:10,596
Yes.

1485
01:45:10,597 --> 01:45:11,430
See if you can get to a phone,

1486
01:45:11,431 --> 01:45:12,306
find out if she's all right.

1487
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:13,391
Are the phones working?

1488
01:45:13,392 --> 01:45:14,517
Try, please!

1489
01:45:14,518 --> 01:45:16,143
Okay.

1490
01:45:16,144 --> 01:45:18,271
Come on, let's get out of here.

1491
01:45:18,272 --> 01:45:20,189
Officer, are the phones working?

1492
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:21,023
Nowhere.

1493
01:45:21,024 --> 01:45:22,400
Out all over the city.

1494
01:45:31,952 --> 01:45:32,952
Hey, Lou.

1495
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:35,496
Miles?

1496
01:45:35,497 --> 01:45:37,249
Look, we got a hurt kid in the back.

1497
01:45:39,084 --> 01:45:40,084
He's in shock.

1498
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:42,962
Well, all we can do is

1499
01:45:42,963 --> 01:45:44,630
keep him warm until we
can get up to a doctor.

1500
01:45:44,631 --> 01:45:45,798
Here.

1501
01:45:45,799 --> 01:45:47,508
You figure you can find
your way to Wilson Plaza

1502
01:45:47,509 --> 01:45:48,342
in this heap?

1503
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:50,761
They got an emergency medical
station set up down there.

1504
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:51,971
I got to find my sister Rosa.

1505
01:45:51,972 --> 01:45:52,805
She went to the movies.

1506
01:45:52,806 --> 01:45:54,015
We've got a lot of injured to move

1507
01:45:54,016 --> 01:45:55,266
and you're gonna move them in this.

1508
01:45:55,267 --> 01:45:56,100
And I'm gonna stay here.

1509
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:56,976
Come on, now give me the bike.

1510
01:45:56,977 --> 01:45:57,810
I've got to find Rosa.

1511
01:45:57,811 --> 01:45:58,894
Listen, just do what he says.

1512
01:45:58,895 --> 01:46:01,814
I'll find Rosa on the bike.

1513
01:46:01,815 --> 01:46:05,526
I can get around better than anybody.

1514
01:46:46,943 --> 01:46:47,777
Okay.

1515
01:46:47,778 --> 01:46:48,611
Move out.

1516
01:46:48,612 --> 01:46:53,575
Single file.

1517
01:47:17,432 --> 01:47:19,058
Hey, grab the cash!

1518
01:47:19,059 --> 01:47:20,768
Okay.

1519
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:22,062
This way.

1520
01:47:23,063 --> 01:47:25,272
Let's go this way.

1521
01:47:25,273 --> 01:47:26,107
Did you get it?

1522
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:29,068
Yeah, hang on.

1523
01:47:29,069 --> 01:47:30,611
Yeah.

1524
01:47:30,612 --> 01:47:31,612
Over here.

1525
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:36,618
Let's go.

1526
01:47:46,128 --> 01:47:48,963
Hey, get away from
that cash register.

1527
01:47:48,964 --> 01:47:51,383
I was just trying to
get home and I was hungry.

1528
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:54,385
Look, I'd like to let
you go, miss,

1529
01:47:54,386 --> 01:47:56,011
but we have strict orders on looters.

1530
01:47:56,012 --> 01:47:57,471
They're all supposed to
be placed under arrest.

1531
01:47:57,472 --> 01:47:58,305
I was just hungry...

1532
01:47:58,306 --> 01:47:59,140
And no exceptions.

1533
01:47:59,141 --> 01:48:02,226
Now, come on, let's go, come on.

1534
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,855
Cars must leave the garage area

1535
01:48:05,856 --> 01:48:07,315
after dropping off patients.

1536
01:48:09,985 --> 01:48:12,695
Hot coffee and food is available

1537
01:48:12,696 --> 01:48:16,241
in basement shopping levels two and three.

1538
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,078
Please keep moving.

1539
01:48:22,247 --> 01:48:23,789
Move right along.

1540
01:48:28,086 --> 01:48:29,463
Please keep moving.

1541
01:48:30,881 --> 01:48:33,800
More doctors are waiting
at the first garage level.

1542
01:48:35,802 --> 01:48:38,304
Hot coffee and food is available

1543
01:48:38,305 --> 01:48:41,016
in basement shopping levels two and three.

1544
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:45,227
All cars must leave the garage area

1545
01:48:45,228 --> 01:48:48,482
after dropping off patients.

1546
01:48:51,443 --> 01:48:53,028
Please keep moving.

1547
01:48:53,945 --> 01:48:57,157
More doctors are waiting
at the first garage level.

1548
01:48:59,242 --> 01:49:03,162
Cars must leave the garage area
after dropping off patients.

1549
01:49:03,163 --> 01:49:04,246
Hold it.

1550
01:49:04,247 --> 01:49:05,247
Hold it.

1551
01:49:06,666 --> 01:49:07,625
Oxygen.

1552
01:49:07,626 --> 01:49:09,502
Get me a blood pressure.

1553
01:49:09,503 --> 01:49:10,711
Wait.

1554
01:49:10,712 --> 01:49:11,712
How do you feel?

1555
01:49:14,216 --> 01:49:15,425
Hard to breathe.

1556
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:18,427
Chest pains?

1557
01:49:18,428 --> 01:49:19,261
Yes.

1558
01:49:19,262 --> 01:49:21,055
He's had a heart attack.

1559
01:49:21,056 --> 01:49:22,056
Come on.

1560
01:49:25,894 --> 01:49:28,271
Start him on a liter of 5% dextrose.

1561
01:49:32,025 --> 01:49:34,318
Cars must leave the garage area

1562
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:35,904
after dropping off patients.

1563
01:49:37,572 --> 01:49:38,572
Stewart!

1564
01:49:39,574 --> 01:49:40,908
Denise and her boy will need help, too.

1565
01:49:40,909 --> 01:49:42,786
I've got to try and find them.

1566
01:49:44,454 --> 01:49:47,039
Is she more important than me?

1567
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,123
Than our life together?

1568
01:49:48,124 --> 01:49:48,958
Than everything,

1569
01:49:48,959 --> 01:49:50,125
Remy, for God's sake,

1570
01:49:50,126 --> 01:49:51,710
Stewart, we tried to be, please.

1571
01:49:51,711 --> 01:49:54,380
I'm sorry.

1572
01:49:54,381 --> 01:49:55,381
Bye.

1573
01:49:58,301 --> 01:50:00,469
Cars must leave the garage area

1574
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:02,055
after dropping off patients.

1575
01:50:03,223 --> 01:50:05,391
Please keep moving.

1576
01:50:05,392 --> 01:50:07,894
Hot coffee and food is available in...

1577
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:15,859
I'm talking with the people
at the dam, Mayor Louis.

1578
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,529
They're maintaining a constant inspection.

1579
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:20,531
I can't take any chances, Colonel.

1580
01:50:20,532 --> 01:50:23,534
Dr. Stockle said we
can expect aftershocks.

1581
01:50:23,535 --> 01:50:24,994
And I just got a report from the Building

1582
01:50:24,995 --> 01:50:26,412
and Safety Department.

1583
01:50:26,413 --> 01:50:28,872
They say some structures
may look perfectly sound

1584
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:30,874
but have been so weakened,

1585
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:33,085
that even a minor quake
can bring them down.

1586
01:50:33,086 --> 01:50:35,630
Evacuate the area
immediately below the dam.

1587
01:50:36,673 --> 01:50:39,675
This is a precautionary
evacuation.

1588
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:41,051
We repeat,

1589
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:44,472
there is no present danger
of the dam collapsing.

1590
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:46,682
Move to high ground,

1591
01:50:46,683 --> 01:50:50,311
west of Highland Avenue
and north of Franklin.

1592
01:50:50,312 --> 01:50:52,939
This is a precautionary evacuation.

1593
01:50:56,318 --> 01:50:58,402
I repeat, this is a
precautionary evacuation.

1594
01:50:58,403 --> 01:50:59,236
Wait, wait!

1595
01:50:59,237 --> 01:51:00,070
They're not lying to you.

1596
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:01,114
You've got plenty of time.

1597
01:51:02,532 --> 01:51:03,658
Stay there, stay there.

1598
01:51:04,618 --> 01:51:05,451
Come on, lay down.

1599
01:51:05,452 --> 01:51:07,532
You're gonna be all right,
you're gonna be all right.

1600
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:32,186
Halt.

1601
01:51:38,693 --> 01:51:39,526
Hey, Sid.

1602
01:51:39,527 --> 01:51:40,694
Hi.

1603
01:51:40,695 --> 01:51:42,237
How come you took
this bunch prisoners?

1604
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:43,323
Suspicion of looting.

1605
01:51:45,367 --> 01:51:47,201
Hey, how about turning that
dark-haired girl over to me?

1606
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:48,410
She's a friend.

1607
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:49,703
Yeah, sure.

1608
01:51:49,704 --> 01:51:50,537
Hey, you.

1609
01:51:50,538 --> 01:51:51,580
Come here.

1610
01:51:51,581 --> 01:51:52,581
Yeah, come on.

1611
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:01,131
Can I go home now?

1612
01:52:01,132 --> 01:52:01,965
Can't allow that.

1613
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:03,092
You're my responsibility.

1614
01:52:03,093 --> 01:52:03,926
- But...
- Come on.

1615
01:52:03,927 --> 01:52:05,386
It's a couple dozen
blocks back to your house,

1616
01:52:05,387 --> 01:52:07,137
and now that it's getting
dark, the animals are loose.

1617
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:07,971
But...

1618
01:52:07,972 --> 01:52:09,932
You just make yourself
comfortable inside the store here.

1619
01:52:09,933 --> 01:52:11,309
I have to send out patrols.

1620
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,567
You all patrol that area up
there and watch out for looters.

1621
01:52:20,568 --> 01:52:21,568
Move out!

1622
01:52:44,426 --> 01:52:47,721
Hey, Sarge, look what we found.

1623
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:52,808
Jody, what a break!

1624
01:52:52,809 --> 01:52:54,101
Caught these guys
around the corner.

1625
01:52:54,102 --> 01:52:55,728
Their car broke down.

1626
01:52:55,729 --> 01:52:59,315
Look at the goodies they had with them.

1627
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,692
We didn't steal 'em, honest.

1628
01:53:01,693 --> 01:53:03,777
The old lady gave us the jewelry.

1629
01:53:03,778 --> 01:53:05,571
You think we ought to shoot 'em?

1630
01:53:05,572 --> 01:53:07,573
Jody, we've just been putting you on.

1631
01:53:07,574 --> 01:53:09,325
You can't kill guys for that.

1632
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,787
Maybe they didn't steal
these necklaces and things.

1633
01:53:13,788 --> 01:53:15,414
Maybe they're just fags

1634
01:53:15,415 --> 01:53:17,666
who like to dress up in women's jewels.

1635
01:53:17,667 --> 01:53:19,084
You find any dresses in the car?

1636
01:53:19,919 --> 01:53:20,836
No, Jody.

1637
01:53:20,837 --> 01:53:22,588
Well, I guess we'll have to shoot 'em.

1638
01:53:23,423 --> 01:53:24,339
Hey, wait a minute, Jody.

1639
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:26,091
I was telling these guys
just today to lay off.

1640
01:53:26,092 --> 01:53:27,092
I swear to God, I was.

1641
01:53:27,093 --> 01:53:28,177
Ask 'em, ask 'em.

1642
01:53:28,178 --> 01:53:29,470
Sure, those naked guys on the wall,

1643
01:53:29,471 --> 01:53:31,054
that didn't mean nothing.

1644
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:32,514
We knew that you lifted weights.

1645
01:53:32,515 --> 01:53:34,808
Scum like you think you
can get away with anything.

1646
01:53:34,809 --> 01:53:36,435
Push people around when you want to.

1647
01:53:36,436 --> 01:53:37,895
Steal when you want to.

1648
01:53:37,896 --> 01:53:39,646
Make fun of men who have
to work for a living, huh?

1649
01:53:39,647 --> 01:53:40,647
But not today.

1650
01:53:41,608 --> 01:53:42,691
Hey, come back, you guys.

1651
01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:43,984
I was only kidding.

1652
01:53:43,985 --> 01:53:47,237
Hey, Hey, don't do that, man.

1653
01:53:55,622 --> 01:53:57,581
Not like back in the
store, is it, Miss Amici?

1654
01:53:57,582 --> 01:53:58,415
Coming in asking for

1655
01:53:58,416 --> 01:54:00,918
double Green Stamps two days
after the special's over, huh?

1656
01:54:00,919 --> 01:54:01,919
None of that stuff.

1657
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:04,797
Move it!

1658
01:54:04,798 --> 01:54:07,090
I want this whole patrol area quarantined.

1659
01:54:07,091 --> 01:54:08,383
No civilians are to be allowed through

1660
01:54:08,384 --> 01:54:10,052
without being questioned.

1661
01:54:10,053 --> 01:54:10,886
Can't tell.

1662
01:54:10,887 --> 01:54:11,720
They might be looters.

1663
01:54:11,721 --> 01:54:12,554
What about the people

1664
01:54:12,555 --> 01:54:14,473
trying to get through to
Wilson Plaza aid station?

1665
01:54:14,474 --> 01:54:15,432
I meant everybody.

1666
01:54:15,433 --> 01:54:17,351
There's no other clear
streets around here.

1667
01:54:17,352 --> 01:54:18,352
Move out!

1668
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,162
Denise!

1669
01:54:43,294 --> 01:54:44,294
Denise!

1670
01:55:02,939 --> 01:55:03,772
All right, out.

1671
01:55:03,773 --> 01:55:04,690
What are you talking about?

1672
01:55:04,691 --> 01:55:05,816
You're healthy enough to walk.

1673
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,609
I got a lot of injured
to move and I mean, fast.

1674
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,778
That dam up there is
liable to go at any minute.

1675
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:11,196
I've got some people I've got to find.

1676
01:55:11,197 --> 01:55:12,406
This thing looks like it'll go anywhere

1677
01:55:12,407 --> 01:55:13,365
and that's just what I need.

1678
01:55:13,366 --> 01:55:14,241
Now, get out.

1679
01:55:14,242 --> 01:55:15,075
Just a minute.

1680
01:55:15,076 --> 01:55:17,286
You're one of those
trouble makers, aren't you?

1681
01:55:17,287 --> 01:55:18,829
I've never shot a trouble maker before,

1682
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:20,039
or are you gonna get out?

1683
01:55:21,165 --> 01:55:22,165
Look.

1684
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:24,877
I'm looking for a girl and a little boy.

1685
01:55:24,878 --> 01:55:26,378
They mean a lot to me.

1686
01:55:26,379 --> 01:55:27,379
Send your butler.

1687
01:55:30,341 --> 01:55:32,050
Where's the shift?

1688
01:55:32,051 --> 01:55:32,968
All of them.

1689
01:55:32,969 --> 01:55:34,344
Depends on what you want to do.

1690
01:55:34,345 --> 01:55:35,846
That's a customized transmission.

1691
01:55:35,847 --> 01:55:37,139
It's got eight forward speeds,

1692
01:55:39,058 --> 01:55:40,726
and three reverse.

1693
01:55:40,727 --> 01:55:43,688
All of them a hell of a lot
harder to operate than that.38.

1694
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:52,279
All right, you're an ambulance driver.

1695
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,280
What?

1696
01:55:56,034 --> 01:55:58,785
I'm sorry, it's been a hell of a day.

1697
01:55:58,786 --> 01:55:59,786
Okay, that's it.

1698
01:56:00,955 --> 01:56:02,247
We got one more.

1699
01:56:49,545 --> 01:56:52,839
We are in desperate need
of blood type AB negative.

1700
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:56,009
Check Red Cross blood
bank, and report back.

1701
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:57,010
Officer Scott.

1702
01:56:57,011 --> 01:56:59,054
Coffee and food is available

1703
01:56:59,055 --> 01:57:04,018
in basement shopping levels two and three.

1704
01:57:05,895 --> 01:57:07,229
I never thought we'd get here.

1705
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:08,063
Careful.

1706
01:57:08,064 --> 01:57:10,608
A long time to go a
couple of lousy miles.

1707
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:14,736
Listen, lady, I gotta go now.

1708
01:57:14,737 --> 01:57:16,279
I gotta move the truck out.

1709
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,531
I'll see you.

1710
01:57:17,532 --> 01:57:20,243
Thank you very much.

1711
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:23,161
He's had a bad fall,

1712
01:57:23,162 --> 01:57:25,289
he's hit his head and
he just won't come to.

1713
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:28,917
Can I go with him?

1714
01:57:28,918 --> 01:57:29,793
No, no.

1715
01:57:29,794 --> 01:57:31,336
We'll get in touch with you.

1716
01:57:31,337 --> 01:57:32,379
On the third level.

1717
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:33,547
Thank you.

1718
01:57:33,548 --> 01:57:34,674
Right around there.

1719
01:57:38,553 --> 01:57:39,970
Coming through.

1720
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:52,899
Please keeping moving.

1721
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:55,360
Those not needing medical aid,

1722
01:57:55,361 --> 01:57:57,779
please stay away from the field hospital.

1723
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:00,574
Please, help me, somebody.

1724
01:58:00,575 --> 01:58:05,496
Doctor, nurse, anybody,

1725
01:58:13,963 --> 01:58:16,382
The building must have
its own generators.

1726
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:41,281
Barbara!

1727
01:58:43,201 --> 01:58:44,367
Barbara!

1728
01:58:44,368 --> 01:58:45,494
Are you okay?

1729
01:58:45,495 --> 01:58:46,995
Yeah, I'm just terrified.

1730
01:58:46,996 --> 01:58:47,829
You?

1731
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,414
I'm fine, but Corry's had a bad fall.

1732
01:58:49,415 --> 01:58:50,665
He's upstairs with the doctor.

1733
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:51,500
Oh!

1734
01:58:51,501 --> 01:58:53,335
Stewart Graff, is he all right?

1735
01:58:53,336 --> 01:58:55,128
Yeah, he's all right,
the last I saw,

1736
01:58:55,129 --> 01:58:57,380
but Mr. Royce had a heart attack.

1737
01:58:57,381 --> 01:58:58,215
He's had a heart attack?

1738
01:58:58,216 --> 01:59:00,300
I'm just waiting word from the doctor.

1739
01:59:00,301 --> 01:59:01,843
Listen, I've got to get out of here,

1740
01:59:01,844 --> 01:59:02,677
I'm going up for some air.

1741
01:59:02,678 --> 01:59:03,512
Will you come with me?

1742
01:59:03,513 --> 01:59:05,138
No, I'd rather stay here.

1743
01:59:05,139 --> 01:59:06,223
I'll see you later.

1744
01:59:06,224 --> 01:59:09,476
Take care.

1745
02:00:06,534 --> 02:00:07,367
He's gone.

1746
02:00:07,368 --> 02:00:08,785
He never had a chance.

1747
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:10,620
Should I tell his daughter?

1748
02:00:10,621 --> 02:00:13,039
I don't want any deaths
reported to the survivors

1749
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,375
until things settle down.

1750
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:33,310
Miss Amici.

1751
02:00:39,775 --> 02:00:40,775
Miss Amici?

1752
02:00:50,036 --> 02:00:51,036
You better eat.

1753
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:53,788
This is nice and fresh.

1754
02:00:53,789 --> 02:00:55,583
Hank got into the deli down the street.

1755
02:01:05,009 --> 02:01:08,053
A lot of guys with hair over
regulation length wear 'em.

1756
02:01:08,054 --> 02:01:09,054
Oh.

1757
02:01:11,807 --> 02:01:13,433
You know, I really used to look forward

1758
02:01:13,434 --> 02:01:15,061
to seeing you in the supermarket.

1759
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:19,272
You never complained like all the rest

1760
02:01:19,273 --> 02:01:20,650
of those women, carrying on.

1761
02:01:22,193 --> 02:01:23,193
Thank you.

1762
02:01:24,195 --> 02:01:26,489
And I hope the lousy
store was knocked flat.

1763
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:31,326
What I really want to do
is open a karate school.

1764
02:01:31,327 --> 02:01:32,912
I'll have enough saved pretty soon.

1765
02:01:33,996 --> 02:01:35,581
A lot of money in karate, you know.

1766
02:01:38,751 --> 02:01:40,086
I'll give you free lessons.

1767
02:01:44,632 --> 02:01:46,050
I'm not really very hungry.

1768
02:01:50,304 --> 02:01:51,430
It's a hot night out.

1769
02:01:52,932 --> 02:01:54,642
Why don't you take off that jacket?

1770
02:01:58,771 --> 02:01:59,646
You always liked me, too.

1771
02:01:59,647 --> 02:02:01,106
I could tell.

1772
02:02:01,107 --> 02:02:03,942
You never said anything, but I could tell.

1773
02:02:05,778 --> 02:02:06,946
Don't, don't hurry me.

1774
02:02:11,742 --> 02:02:12,994
It's no real fun that way.

1775
02:02:31,637 --> 02:02:32,470
Everything all right?

1776
02:02:32,471 --> 02:02:33,722
Yeah, fine.

1777
02:02:38,227 --> 02:02:39,686
Another one of those damned earth slides

1778
02:02:39,687 --> 02:02:41,646
on the other side of the reservoir?

1779
02:02:41,647 --> 02:02:42,647
Uh-huh.

1780
02:02:44,108 --> 02:02:45,192
That's a scary sound.

1781
02:02:46,777 --> 02:02:47,777
Uh-huh.

1782
02:02:58,748 --> 02:03:00,332
How is he?

1783
02:03:00,333 --> 02:03:01,958
Oh, he's going to be all right.

1784
02:03:01,959 --> 02:03:03,418
Mild shock and a concussion.

1785
02:03:03,419 --> 02:03:05,337
I've given him something
to help him sleep.

1786
02:03:05,338 --> 02:03:06,463
Where are you taking him now?

1787
02:03:06,464 --> 02:03:08,006
Well, the Army Medics have set up

1788
02:03:08,007 --> 02:03:10,968
their field x-ray trucks
in the third level garage.

1789
02:03:15,681 --> 02:03:17,098
Doctor!

1790
02:03:17,099 --> 02:03:18,475
Doctor!

1791
02:03:18,476 --> 02:03:23,104
Why aren't you with my father?

1792
02:03:23,105 --> 02:03:24,899
Don't bother me now.

1793
02:04:54,488 --> 02:04:56,198
Get down, get down!

1794
02:05:15,426 --> 02:05:17,135
Red Cross emergency aid stations

1795
02:05:17,136 --> 02:05:18,178
are already functioning.

1796
02:05:18,179 --> 02:05:19,429
Are you sure you know
the way to Wilson Plaza?

1797
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:21,473
Damn it, that's where I just came from.

1798
02:05:21,474 --> 02:05:23,475
The Mayor's office
has not yet released

1799
02:05:23,476 --> 02:05:25,602
a damage report on the aftershock.

1800
02:05:25,603 --> 02:05:28,021
However, details are expected momentarily.

1801
02:05:28,022 --> 02:05:29,022
Please stand by.

1802
02:05:29,857 --> 02:05:32,150
There's other buildings
sure to have come down.

1803
02:05:32,151 --> 02:05:35,320
First time in my life I'm
ashamed of my profession.

1804
02:05:35,321 --> 02:05:38,573
We never should have put up
those 40-story monstrosities.

1805
02:05:38,574 --> 02:05:39,574
Not here.

1806
02:05:45,247 --> 02:05:46,247
Hey!

1807
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:48,458
What's the matter?

1808
02:05:48,459 --> 02:05:50,002
The door's out of line.

1809
02:05:54,381 --> 02:05:56,842
It wasn't before that
aftershock a few minutes ago.

1810
02:06:03,849 --> 02:06:05,600
Don't be scared.

1811
02:06:05,601 --> 02:06:08,229
We'll be feelin' those
quivers for days, the CO said.

1812
02:06:09,563 --> 02:06:10,563
That looks great.

1813
02:06:12,233 --> 02:06:14,817
A pretty girl ought to have nice things.

1814
02:06:14,818 --> 02:06:16,861
I've always thought so.

1815
02:06:16,862 --> 02:06:19,280
Hey, you gotta forget
about the way it used to be.

1816
02:06:19,281 --> 02:06:20,574
Your brother could be dead.

1817
02:06:22,409 --> 02:06:25,329
Nobody left but me to take care of you.

1818
02:06:28,332 --> 02:06:30,793
Well, I've got another
brother in San Francisco.

1819
02:06:31,835 --> 02:06:32,878
And he's in the Mafia.

1820
02:06:33,837 --> 02:06:36,297
There's another car coming, Jody.

1821
02:06:42,555 --> 02:06:43,680
This area's quarantined.

1822
02:06:43,681 --> 02:06:45,515
You'll have to detour.

1823
02:06:45,516 --> 02:06:46,558
I'm a police officer.

1824
02:06:46,559 --> 02:06:48,059
We're transporting injured people.

1825
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,727
This is an emergency.

1826
02:06:49,728 --> 02:06:51,437
What isn't after an earthquake?

1827
02:06:51,438 --> 02:06:53,356
Go back or take them to
a Hare Krishna temple.

1828
02:06:53,357 --> 02:06:54,732
Lou, help me.

1829
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:56,025
He's nuts!

1830
02:06:56,026 --> 02:06:56,859
Crazy.

1831
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:57,694
What the hell are you doing?

1832
02:06:57,695 --> 02:06:58,695
I know this kid.

1833
02:06:59,363 --> 02:07:00,280
She's under detention.

1834
02:07:00,281 --> 02:07:01,114
Looting.

1835
02:07:01,115 --> 02:07:02,115
Take it easy.

1836
02:07:03,325 --> 02:07:04,325
All right.

1837
02:07:05,411 --> 02:07:06,244
Okay.

1838
02:07:06,245 --> 02:07:07,203
Go back the way you came.

1839
02:07:07,204 --> 02:07:08,204
Okay.

1840
02:07:09,373 --> 02:07:10,373
Move out!

1841
02:07:13,586 --> 02:07:14,919
Don't leave me with him!

1842
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:15,920
Lou!

1843
02:07:22,928 --> 02:07:24,513
Lou, help me!

1844
02:07:30,102 --> 02:07:31,102
Lou, help me!

1845
02:07:34,523 --> 02:07:37,025
Lou!

1846
02:07:37,026 --> 02:07:38,192
I'm going for an officer.

1847
02:07:38,193 --> 02:07:39,944
That guy in there is cracked.

1848
02:07:39,945 --> 02:07:41,446
Come on, hey, come on.

1849
02:07:44,366 --> 02:07:45,784
Pull up another hundred feet.

1850
02:07:52,958 --> 02:07:54,668
Pull it around the corner and stop.

1851
02:08:05,512 --> 02:08:06,972
Nuts, am I, huh?

1852
02:08:11,644 --> 02:08:12,644
You got your nerve.

1853
02:08:17,232 --> 02:08:18,232
Rosa!

1854
02:08:20,235 --> 02:08:21,235
Let's go.

1855
02:08:21,904 --> 02:08:22,945
Better not.

1856
02:08:40,047 --> 02:08:40,880
Come on, Rosa.

1857
02:08:40,881 --> 02:08:41,714
Come on.

1858
02:08:41,715 --> 02:08:43,508
Settle down, will you, huh?

1859
02:08:43,509 --> 02:08:46,886
Earthquakes bring out the
worst in some guys, that's all.

1860
02:08:46,887 --> 02:08:48,388
Here.

1861
02:08:48,389 --> 02:08:49,222
Come on.

1862
02:08:49,223 --> 02:08:50,056
Here, look.

1863
02:08:50,057 --> 02:08:51,349
Look what you got.

1864
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:53,351
Look at what you got to take care of.

1865
02:08:53,352 --> 02:08:56,270
Caused by a ruptured gas main.

1866
02:08:58,273 --> 02:09:01,317
Oh.

1867
02:09:01,318 --> 02:09:03,194
Total evacuation is under way.

1868
02:09:03,195 --> 02:09:05,697
My brother told me you
were a strange kind of cop.

1869
02:09:05,698 --> 02:09:07,865
Dozens of weakened
structures collapsed

1870
02:09:07,866 --> 02:09:09,701
when the aftershock hit.

1871
02:09:09,702 --> 02:09:11,494
The worst disaster was the four-year-old,

1872
02:09:11,495 --> 02:09:14,580
supposedly earthquake-proof, Wilson Plaza.

1873
02:09:14,581 --> 02:09:17,166
The Army Corps of Engineers is
rushing all available workers

1874
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:18,544
and equipment to the scene.

1875
02:09:19,503 --> 02:09:21,796
Stand by for further bulletins.

1876
02:09:35,185 --> 02:09:37,104
I've never been so afraid in my life.

1877
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:38,896
Well, you're safe now.

1878
02:09:38,897 --> 02:09:41,441
We were lucky to get seats on this flight.

1879
02:09:41,442 --> 02:09:43,193
A couple hours we'll be in Honolulu.

1880
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:46,571
I don't know if it's me or the drink,

1881
02:09:46,572 --> 02:09:48,740
but I'm really getting sleepy.

1882
02:09:48,741 --> 02:09:49,574
Why don't you take a nap.

1883
02:09:49,575 --> 02:09:50,658
It'll do you good.

1884
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:51,659
Yeah.

1885
02:09:53,579 --> 02:09:55,496
This is your captain.

1886
02:09:55,497 --> 02:09:57,290
We have just received the latest news

1887
02:09:57,291 --> 02:09:58,834
on the Los Angeles earthquakes.

1888
02:10:00,043 --> 02:10:02,503
The big one that hit early this afternoon

1889
02:10:02,504 --> 02:10:05,506
registered 9.9 on the Richter scale.

1890
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:08,426
Greater than the San
Francisco quake in 1906,

1891
02:10:08,427 --> 02:10:10,512
which registered 8.3.

1892
02:10:12,097 --> 02:10:14,140
So far, the dam at the
Hollywood reservoir,

1893
02:10:14,141 --> 02:10:15,976
although damaged, is still intact.

1894
02:10:17,561 --> 02:10:20,188
The dam has been under close
and constant surveillance

1895
02:10:20,189 --> 02:10:23,192
since the first earthquake
that hit at 7:46 this morning.

1896
02:10:24,485 --> 02:10:27,070
The aftershocks have
been causing more damage.

1897
02:10:28,113 --> 02:10:29,405
Hospitals and soup kitchens

1898
02:10:29,406 --> 02:10:31,366
have been set up at various locations.

1899
02:10:32,701 --> 02:10:34,494
As of now, it has been impossible

1900
02:10:34,495 --> 02:10:36,996
to estimate the number
of people injured or dead

1901
02:10:36,997 --> 02:10:38,207
and the amount of damage.

1902
02:10:39,958 --> 02:10:41,210
Wait just a minute, folks.

1903
02:10:46,381 --> 02:10:47,840
The cards were right.

1904
02:10:47,841 --> 02:10:48,800
What did you say?

1905
02:10:48,801 --> 02:10:50,176
Oh, no, nothing.

1906
02:10:50,177 --> 02:10:52,137
I'm just glad that we're both all right.

1907
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:56,141
Kathie, I want to talk to you seriously.

1908
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:58,100
Can it wait?

1909
02:10:58,101 --> 02:10:59,560
No.

1910
02:10:59,561 --> 02:11:01,938
Here's the latest
from Los Angeles.

1911
02:11:01,939 --> 02:11:05,608
The last aftershock has caused
more building to collapse.

1912
02:11:05,609 --> 02:11:08,402
One of these buildings
was the Wilson Plaza,

1913
02:11:08,403 --> 02:11:11,614
where a hospital has been
set up in the sub-basement.

1914
02:11:11,615 --> 02:11:13,741
The fate of the people
trapped in the sub-basement

1915
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:14,910
is unknown at this time.

1916
02:11:15,911 --> 02:11:18,205
As the news comes in,
I'll keep you informed.

1917
02:11:22,209 --> 02:11:25,795
I'm gonna leave you in Hawaii
and go back to Los Angeles.

1918
02:11:25,796 --> 02:11:27,213
Whatever for?

1919
02:11:27,214 --> 02:11:29,173
To help, in any way I can.

1920
02:11:29,174 --> 02:11:31,510
They're gonna need all the
engineers they can get.

1921
02:11:32,553 --> 02:11:34,345
But this is our honeymoon.

1922
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,472
Kathie, you're not thinking straight.

1923
02:11:36,473 --> 02:11:39,059
We were almost victims of
that earthquake ourselves.

1924
02:11:40,727 --> 02:11:41,561
You're right.

1925
02:11:41,562 --> 02:11:42,770
I'm sorry.

1926
02:11:42,771 --> 02:11:45,565
I didn't mean to be selfish and unfeeling.

1927
02:11:45,566 --> 02:11:46,566
I know you didn't.

1928
02:11:48,819 --> 02:11:51,363
Can't you wait a few more
days before you go back?

1929
02:11:52,614 --> 02:11:53,614
No.

1930
02:11:54,366 --> 02:11:55,908
Two days?

1931
02:11:55,909 --> 02:11:56,909
No.

1932
02:11:57,703 --> 02:11:58,703
One day?

1933
02:12:04,793 --> 02:12:06,503
All right, one day.

1934
02:12:22,477 --> 02:12:24,520
Oh, my God.

1935
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:25,521
Inspector!

1936
02:12:26,982 --> 02:12:27,982
Inspector!

1937
02:12:31,278 --> 02:12:32,111
Hold it.

1938
02:12:32,112 --> 02:12:33,237
Stop.

1939
02:12:33,238 --> 02:12:34,071
You can't go any farther.

1940
02:12:34,072 --> 02:12:35,698
I'm a police officer,
transporting injured people.

1941
02:12:35,699 --> 02:12:36,909
Okay, come on.

1942
02:12:44,333 --> 02:12:45,750
I'm sorry,
lady, now you can't go...

1943
02:12:45,751 --> 02:12:47,169
Officer, I've got to get to.

1944
02:12:48,337 --> 02:12:49,253
It's urgent.

1945
02:12:49,254 --> 02:12:50,087
Listen, listen.

1946
02:12:50,088 --> 02:12:52,757
Mr. Graff, they're still down there.

1947
02:12:52,758 --> 02:12:54,342
Remy and Mr. Royce.

1948
02:12:54,343 --> 02:12:55,176
Denise, too.

1949
02:12:55,177 --> 02:12:56,177
She asked for you.

1950
02:12:57,095 --> 02:12:58,679
Where were they in the building?

1951
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:00,349
The third level below.

1952
02:13:02,392 --> 02:13:03,392
Come on.

1953
02:13:05,812 --> 02:13:06,812
I agree.

1954
02:13:08,023 --> 02:13:09,106
There's a chance people
could still be alive

1955
02:13:09,107 --> 02:13:10,108
in the sub-basements.

1956
02:13:12,361 --> 02:13:14,446
It'll take days to
unearth all this debris.

1957
02:13:16,114 --> 02:13:18,950
Look, the air supply can't
last more than a few hours.

1958
02:13:18,951 --> 02:13:20,993
I know the design of this building.

1959
02:13:20,994 --> 02:13:22,536
I've been through it 100 times.

1960
02:13:22,537 --> 02:13:25,832
The basement extends clear out
to the street on this side.

1961
02:13:27,626 --> 02:13:29,251
If the storm drain runs down deep enough,

1962
02:13:29,252 --> 02:13:30,127
all you'd have to tunnel through

1963
02:13:30,128 --> 02:13:33,047
is a couple of layers of
concrete and a few feet of dirt.

1964
02:13:33,048 --> 02:13:34,590
I got radio word a few minutes ago,

1965
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:37,677
that the Hollywood reservoir
dam is disintegrating.

1966
02:13:37,678 --> 02:13:39,178
We're on high ground here,

1967
02:13:39,179 --> 02:13:40,889
but those drains are 40 feet down.

1968
02:13:41,932 --> 02:13:44,350
Believe me, if the dam goes,
they'll fill up in minutes.

1969
02:13:44,351 --> 02:13:47,269
Dams have lasted for weeks
with major breeches in them.

1970
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:48,771
It's too dangerous to try.

1971
02:13:48,772 --> 02:13:50,690
Besides, the sewers must've
cracked around like whips.

1972
02:13:50,691 --> 02:13:52,441
You know, the eastern
approach is totally blocked.

1973
02:13:52,442 --> 02:13:54,402
Yeah, well, what about the other end?

1974
02:13:54,403 --> 02:13:56,779
Well, I was just gonna
call up an inspection team.

1975
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:58,531
Come and see for yourself.

1976
02:13:58,532 --> 02:14:00,616
Let's go.

1977
02:14:00,617 --> 02:14:04,120
Make way, fellas.

1978
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:12,962
Lou, where are you going?

1979
02:14:12,963 --> 02:14:14,506
I'm going with them.

1980
02:14:42,826 --> 02:14:45,287
Let's have a look.

1981
02:14:47,205 --> 02:14:48,080
Can't you get through here?

1982
02:14:48,081 --> 02:14:50,708
We don't know how far this opening runs.

1983
02:14:50,709 --> 02:14:51,542
You haven't checked?

1984
02:14:51,543 --> 02:14:53,127
My men stay here.

1985
02:14:53,128 --> 02:14:54,713
That could cave in any second!

1986
02:14:56,715 --> 02:14:58,758
Hey, you know as well as I do,

1987
02:14:58,759 --> 02:15:00,176
the chances are 100 to one,

1988
02:15:00,177 --> 02:15:05,140
that everybody in that building is dead.

1989
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:14,941
Holy mother!

1990
02:16:14,501 --> 02:16:16,127
I got through.

1991
02:16:17,712 --> 02:16:19,046
Can you get me a jackhammer
and a bolt cutter?

1992
02:16:19,047 --> 02:16:22,049
You use a jackhammer in
there, the roof'll fall in.

1993
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:23,801
Look, I think there's
some people alive in there,

1994
02:16:23,802 --> 02:16:25,344
and I'm gonna try and get 'em out.

1995
02:16:25,345 --> 02:16:26,762
Well, nobody else is.

1996
02:16:26,763 --> 02:16:28,389
And you can't do it all alone.

1997
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:29,599
Yeah, I won't be alone.

1998
02:16:30,684 --> 02:16:31,684
He's coming with me.

1999
02:17:02,382 --> 02:17:03,924
Make sure they don't
turn on the compressor

2000
02:17:03,925 --> 02:17:05,759
for this hammer until we signal.

2001
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,760
Right.

2002
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,470
Any word from the dam?

2003
02:17:08,471 --> 02:17:09,471
The last radio report we had,

2004
02:17:09,472 --> 02:17:11,432
said no further cracks had appeared.

2005
02:17:11,433 --> 02:17:12,266
Swell.

2006
02:17:12,267 --> 02:17:15,895
Hey, you sure I can't talk
you out of this insanity?

2007
02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:18,899
Colonel,
I really wish you could.

2008
02:17:22,444 --> 02:17:23,444
Good luck.

2009
02:17:30,744 --> 02:17:32,204
Watch your head.

2010
02:17:35,665 --> 02:17:36,665
Keep it coming!

2011
02:17:39,002 --> 02:17:40,544
I've paced it off.

2012
02:17:40,545 --> 02:17:41,378
We ought to break through

2013
02:17:41,379 --> 02:17:43,005
right about the third basement level.

2014
02:17:43,006 --> 02:17:43,839
This thing ready?

2015
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:44,673
All right.

2016
02:17:44,674 --> 02:17:45,716
The pressure's ready.

2017
02:17:45,717 --> 02:17:46,717
Hold on.

2018
02:17:56,645 --> 02:17:58,062
I'm getting outta here.

2019
02:18:13,703 --> 02:18:15,913
Inspector!

2020
02:18:15,914 --> 02:18:17,164
Inspector!

2021
02:18:17,165 --> 02:18:18,999
Get the hell outta here!

2022
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,917
It's breaking up.

2023
02:18:19,918 --> 02:18:20,918
Get out!

2024
02:18:22,170 --> 02:18:23,546
Get out, get out!

2025
02:18:24,547 --> 02:18:26,382
It's breaking up, get out!

2026
02:18:37,227 --> 02:18:39,311
Should be a couple of feet of earth

2027
02:18:39,312 --> 02:18:41,189
then just the basement wall.

2028
02:18:53,618 --> 02:18:55,412
Hand me that light.

2029
02:20:11,696 --> 02:20:14,031
We're through!

2030
02:20:14,032 --> 02:20:15,949
Oh, my God!

2031
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:16,784
They're through!

2032
02:20:16,785 --> 02:20:19,329
We're saved!

2033
02:20:21,998 --> 02:20:23,499
Anybody in there?

2034
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:25,627
About 70 of us.

2035
02:20:47,816 --> 02:20:48,816
Got it.

2036
02:20:50,652 --> 02:20:51,485
Stewart.

2037
02:20:51,486 --> 02:20:52,486
Denise.

2038
02:20:58,910 --> 02:21:01,203
Come on, let's go.

2039
02:21:07,836 --> 02:21:11,296
Be careful of the
loose area down there.

2040
02:21:11,297 --> 02:21:12,297
Easy, easy, easy.

2041
02:21:14,634 --> 02:21:16,718
Careful of the loose stuff down there.

2042
02:21:39,784 --> 02:21:40,784
No, not again.

2043
02:21:41,453 --> 02:21:44,289
Oh God.

2044
02:21:46,082 --> 02:21:48,459
It stopped, it stopped.

2045
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:51,336
Take it easy and watch
your head down below.

2046
02:21:51,337 --> 02:21:54,840
I got you, I got you.

2047
02:23:41,739 --> 02:23:43,282
Take your time and watch it down there.

2048
02:23:43,283 --> 02:23:44,409
That stuff is all loose.

2049
02:23:48,204 --> 02:23:52,000
Give us a hand down here.

2050
02:23:54,127 --> 02:23:54,960
Straight up.

2051
02:23:54,961 --> 02:23:59,882
Straight up.

2052
02:24:17,442 --> 02:24:22,405
Nice and easy.

2053
02:24:27,869 --> 02:24:28,869
Okay.

2054
02:24:33,207 --> 02:24:34,541
That's all of them.

2055
02:24:34,542 --> 02:24:35,375
Let's go.

2056
02:24:35,376 --> 02:24:36,586
Yeah.

2057
02:25:05,531 --> 02:25:06,365
Watch it.

2058
02:25:06,366 --> 02:25:07,616
Don't panic now.

2059
02:25:35,436 --> 02:25:36,478
Women first!

2060
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:37,729
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

2061
02:25:37,730 --> 02:25:39,231
Relax, there's lots of time.

2062
02:25:39,232 --> 02:25:40,482
Take it easy, take it easy.

2063
02:25:59,293 --> 02:26:00,377
Take it easy.

2064
02:26:00,378 --> 02:26:02,546
One at a time, women first.

2065
02:26:02,547 --> 02:26:04,798
Take it easy, take it easy.

2066
02:26:12,390 --> 02:26:14,600
Don't panic.

2067
02:26:21,858 --> 02:26:22,858
Go on, Remy.

2068
02:27:11,699 --> 02:27:12,742
Wait, wait.

2069
02:27:28,633 --> 02:27:29,633
Remy!

2070
02:28:22,687 --> 02:28:24,104
Lou!

2071
02:28:24,105 --> 02:28:25,105
Lou!

2072
02:28:39,161 --> 02:28:42,205
I'm sorry to bring
you more bad news.

2073
02:28:42,206 --> 02:28:44,624
The dam has broken.

2074
02:28:44,625 --> 02:28:45,834
At this very moment,

2075
02:28:45,835 --> 02:28:47,795
it is destroying everything in its path.

2076
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:51,549
Los Angeles is being
completely demolished.

2077
02:28:52,592 --> 02:28:53,592
There is no hope.

2078
02:28:55,011 --> 02:28:57,971
I think we should observe a
few seconds of silent prayer

2079
02:28:57,972 --> 02:29:00,600
for all those caught in
this appalling catastrophe.

2080
02:29:12,528 --> 02:29:14,404
As soon as we land, I'm
gonna contact the Honolulu

2081
02:29:14,405 --> 02:29:15,864
office of Royce Construction Company

2082
02:29:15,865 --> 02:29:17,908
and offer them my services.

2083
02:29:17,909 --> 02:29:19,034
Well, what if they refuse?

2084
02:29:19,035 --> 02:29:19,868
They won't.

2085
02:29:19,869 --> 02:29:22,109
If that happens, I'll find
some way to get back and help.

2086
02:29:22,872 --> 02:29:25,040
Well, I'm going with you.

2087
02:29:25,041 --> 02:29:27,293
No, I think you'd be
better off in Hawaii.

2088
02:29:28,586 --> 02:29:30,379
A wife's place is with her husband.

2089
02:29:34,842 --> 02:29:36,343
You mean that?

2090
02:29:36,344 --> 02:29:37,969
That's the way I was brought up,

2091
02:29:37,970 --> 02:29:40,639
and besides, I love you very much.

2092
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:42,183
Los Angeles has to be rebuilt.

2093
02:29:43,476 --> 02:29:45,602
And I wanna be a part of it.

2094
02:29:45,603 --> 02:29:46,603
Okay?

2095
02:29:47,647 --> 02:29:48,647
You're the boss.

2096
02:30:01,327 --> 02:30:05,665
This used to be a
hell of a town, officer.

2097
02:30:06,958 --> 02:30:07,958
Yeah.

2098
02:30:12,296 --> 02:30:14,881
Thank God some of them made it.
