1
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,995
...nails Harrison, and drags him
down as if he were gonna hog-tie him, too.

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,095
JB Logan helped out.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,168
Anderson's ninth tackle,
he has two behind the line of scrimmage.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,838
Give Harrison four yards to the twenty-six.

5
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,258
Stoney Walker's coming in
and Rufus Middleton is going out,

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,968
giving Middleton a breather.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,847
Boy, has he been burning up
a few miles today on stadium turf.

8
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,350
Rufus Middleton. All right,
it's second and six on the twenty-six.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,980
Stoney Walker deployed wide right, Larry
Singer left. The line is set. The snap...

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,066
How long do we have to keep
watching this crap?

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,736
...tumbled down
on the twenty-three. A quick trap.

12
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:47,489
He had room to run except
for that man from Jacksonville,

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,702
James Washington La Croix,
who made a good, sure, low tackle,

14
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,955
just as Harrison was about to spurt
deep into the secondary.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,000
We've had quite an exciting
ball game this afternoon...

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,135
Only a moron could sit and watch
two football games one after the other.

17
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,592
Victorio covers him there.
Singer left.

18
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,761
It's about time Robinson went to Singer.

19
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,722
Harrison and Mancuso
are split behind Robinson.

20
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,725
Robinson gives instead to Harrison,
up the middle again.

21
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,312
He may have the first down,
he's close to the 20-yard line.

22
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,397
Let's see where they mark the ball.

23
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:25,360
Billy Jacoby and Sonny Anderson
again making the tackle. It's going to be...

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,746
Thank God.

25
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:35,923
That feels so good.
I feel so relaxed.

26
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,333
You know the help is off, Crewe.

27
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,433
The phones are off.

28
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,478
We're all alone.

29
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,141
Let's get it on, honey. Come on.

30
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,439
Honey.
- What?

31
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,986
Wake up, baby. Come on.
You know it'll be good.

32
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,903
You know how good it is.
Come on, Crewe.

33
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,123
Get off me.

34
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,129
Son of a bitch.

35
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,931
Where are you going?

36
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,892
Splitting.
- Splitting?

37
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:30,217
You split when I tell you to split,
you All-American son of a bitch.

38
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,317
Lovely, lovely.

39
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,610
And when you walk out, stay out.

40
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,801
You're too expensive to be useless.

41
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,542
Whore.

42
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:55,628
That's exactly what you are, a whore.
- I never looked at it that way before.

43
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,843
Everybody's bought you.

44
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,463
Colleges, the pros, your gamblers.

45
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,126
Who bought those
beautiful caps on your teeth,

46
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,171
the clothes you're wearing
and the bloody tan you've got?

47
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,271
Me.

48
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,469
Have I ever neglected to thank you,
Melissa?

49
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,569
You has-been.

50
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,222
Where're your keys?

51
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,477
If I took everything back... Stay away from
my keys. You'd be bare-assed naked.

52
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:25,742
Where're your goddamn keys?
- Don't touch my keys.

53
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,779
I think the love
has gone out of our relationship.

54
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,879
Bastard.

55
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,962
Don't you take my Maserati.

56
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,502
I earned it.

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,800
I told you not to touch my goddamn car.

58
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,807
Police.

59
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:24,568
Do you have a driver's licence?
- What, are you taking a poll?

60
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,520
Well, look what we got here.
A miniature cop.

61
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,939
Can we see your driver's licence?

62
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,483
What?

63
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,110
Can we see your driver's licence?

64
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,413
See if I can get it out.

65
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,287
It's him all right.

66
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,539
Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

67
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,667
What?
- Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

68
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,437
I couldn't find a car wash.

69
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,821
Step away from the bar.

70
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,071
Mister, step away from the bar.

71
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,157
Don't get pushy, cowboy.

72
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,206
Turn it around.
- Come on.

73
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,299
Hold that son of a bitch.
- Damn.

74
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:38,765
Now we got you
for stealing a car, drunken driving,

75
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,914
drunk in public and resisting arrest.

76
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,702
Want something else?
- Yeah. I'm going to make you taller.

77
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,742
OK, men, let's go.

78
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,880
Good afternoon.
Where are you from?

79
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,218
Palm Beach County.
- Thank you, sir. Second door down.

80
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,761
This way, men.

81
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:15,791
They gave you $10,000
for shaving off your moustache on TV?

82
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,715
How about giving me $5,000 worth?

83
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:28,026
Coming right off: there's about
twenty-five hundred, three thousand,

84
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,947
four thousand coming up,

85
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,419
five thousand.

86
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,438
Anything else, sir?
- That's it.

87
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,971
Warden Hazen thinks
you're pretty hot stuff.

88
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,935
But I'm Captain Knauer.

89
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:42,917
I'm going to spell
things out for you. I run this prison.

90
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,940
He sits there growing old.
I'm out here busting heads.

91
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,420
And I run the football team.

92
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,731
What football team?
- My football team.

93
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,213
Oh.

94
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,452
Now, Hazen's going to ask you
to help coach.

95
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,272
And you just tell him, 'No way'.

96
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,438
Know something?

97
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,019
I don't like you.

98
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,902
You understand that?

99
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,116
Oh, yeah.

100
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,567
Attention Cell Block 3 A. Please report as
scheduled to your period assignment,

101
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,195
except for carpentry
and accounting classes.

102
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:39,330
All men assigned to farm detail will
meet at one o'clock in the Rotunda.

103
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:45,006
Warden, Captain Knauer's here
with inmate Crewe.

104
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,384
Send him in.
- Thank you, sir.

105
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,981
You can go in now.
- Thank you, Miss Toot.

106
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,914
Paul Crewe.

107
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,125
The Wrecking Crewe.

108
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,696
It's good to have you here.
- Thank you.

109
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:28,292
Young people can learn a great deal
from a skilful football game.

110
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:33,054
Offence, defence,
spirit of achievement, teamwork.

111
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,400
You might say...

112
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:50,329
...the game embodies
what has made our country great.

113
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,736
It's a great game.
It's played by great men.

114
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:04,131
We have something of a football team
here ourselves, you know.

115
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,429
First rank, semi-pro,
South-eastern League.

116
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,551
Runner-up, National Champions,
past five years.

117
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,601
Mister Crewe,
what do you think of semi-pro ball?

118
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,815
Semi-pro's a joke.

119
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:31,408
Well, perhaps we could use
a few pointers from the big leagues.

120
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:36,497
Captain, what do you say
to Mister Crewe here looking in,

121
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,155
giving us the benefit
of his invaluable knowledge?

122
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:46,120
That's a real good idea, Warden.
We could use all the help we can get.

123
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,455
Well?

124
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,876
I haven't held a football in eight years.
I'm not in very good shape.

125
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,963
Nobody's asked you to play,
Mister Crewe.

126
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:00,855
What we need is a coach. New blood.

127
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,068
New game plan.

128
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:12,980
Anybody who was pro football's
Most Valuable Player is special,

129
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,831
and I want to have that.

130
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,024
I'm not interested in football anymore.

131
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:28,004
Mister Crewe, I don't mind saying,

132
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:32,332
I pulled a lot of strings
to get you down here.

133
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,432
I appreciate that.

134
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,518
Look.

135
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,979
What I want is a national title.

136
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,512
If, perchance, you should help us
achieve that goal,

137
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:50,488
I expect your stay here
with us will be very agreeable.

138
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,994
Well?

139
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:01,544
I just want to do my time,
then get out of here.

140
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,588
Very well.

141
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:15,626
All right, I'll turn you over
to the good hands of Captain Knauer.

142
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,726
Swamp reclamation.

143
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,064
Get him out of here.

144
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,311
Captain.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,655
I'd like a word with you.

146
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,315
For the past five years,
you've promised me the national title,

147
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,901
and every year,
you've come up short.

148
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,738
I try, sir.
- When I want an answer, I'll indicate.

149
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,838
Yes, sir.

150
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,784
You've asked for bonus money.

151
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:52,121
Certainly take their football seriously,
don't they?

152
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:56,959
This year you've asked for new
game uniforms. I've OK'ed them.

153
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,253
Everything you've asked for,
I've given you.

154
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,328
Yes, sir. And I appreciate it, sir.

155
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,181
I want that title.

156
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,888
You'll give me that title,
or you'll be out of a job.

157
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,600
You and all that
over-priced beef you call a team.

158
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,845
We should be in the Superbowl by now.

159
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:21,650
I've lost patience. The gravy train is over.
This year you're going to win.

160
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,235
You've lovely hair.

161
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:29,115
...your last chance. Prison is no
different from any other community.

162
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,211
Ever find any spiders in it?

163
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,830
...then I haven't done my job.

164
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,735
I'm not being unreasonable, am I?

165
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,794
No, sir.
- Then you'll give me the title?

166
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,350
Yes, sir.
- Good.

167
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,389
I want that man out there.

168
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:52,686
And I want you to make
that son of a bitch enthusiastic.

169
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:58,651
Ever do it standing up?
- Let's move it.

170
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,908
I say forget football, you do it.
- Why are you so mad?

171
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:17,638
You better start taking life seriously.
- I did exactly what you told me to do.

172
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,770
Hey, Superstar.
Get a good night's sleep?

173
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,148
Too bad you missed breakfast.
It was yummy.

174
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,858
Gotta get it done.

175
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:50,083
This is make-work day.
- What's make-work day?

176
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,741
You shovel it in and shovel back out again.

177
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,091
Hustle in there now.
Cover that bank.

178
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,759
Get that wheelbarrow, Woody.

179
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,598
Let's go. Single file.

180
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,550
Hang it up, hang it up.
Let's get covered.

181
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,564
All right, let's go. Come on.

182
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,776
Get a shovel.

183
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,489
Hey, Superstar.

184
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,619
I got an idea. Granny.

185
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,122
You ever work with a nigger before?

186
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,226
Get another shovel there, boy.

187
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,014
All right. Let's go.

188
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,943
Heave it up.

189
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,112
Sitting down, boss?
- Not today, boy.

190
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:10,245
Wiping off, boss?
- Not today, boy.

191
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,839
Rolling one, boss?
- Not yet, boy.

192
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,244
Now you know how black man's work feels.

193
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,996
How do you like it?

194
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,476
Oh, it sort of grows on you.

195
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,682
No talking there, Granny.

196
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:30,561
Yes, boss.
- You'll find yourselves in bad time.

197
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:34,770
Yes, boss. Sorry about that, boss.

198
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,097
What's he think this is, good time?

199
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:42,740
Looky, looky, looky,
here comes cooky.

200
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,911
Big deal. Look at him now.

201
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,966
How do you like them apples,
Superstar?

202
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,765
Move the line.

203
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,923
Real friendly types you got around here.

204
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,891
Might be your own fault.
- Oh, really?

205
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:03,223
Most of these old boys have nothing.
Never had nothing to start with.

206
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:07,107
But you, you had it all.

207
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:11,648
Then you let your team-mates down,
got caught taking bribes.

208
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,943
I did, did I?
- I ain't saying either way.

209
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,821
I'm just saying
you could've robbed banks, sold dope,

210
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,700
stole your grandmother's pension,
and none of us would've minded.

211
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,730
But shaving points off a football game,
that's un-American.

212
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,836
You take football real serious down here.

213
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,465
Mind if I ask you one question?
- Yeah, I do.

214
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,641
Why'd you do it?

215
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:43,735
It's a long story.
- Well, I got eight years.

216
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,618
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?

217
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,752
That's a member
of the warden's football team.

218
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:08,491
Some of these guards are not
just everyday run-of-the-mill guards.

219
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,515
Crewe. Granville. Front and centre.

220
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,886
What now?

221
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:20,694
That means we don't get
to finish this delicious lunch.

222
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,037
What's he looking for?

223
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,442
Snakes.

224
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,914
Snakes?
- Yeah.

225
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,509
Take five.

226
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,734
Rolling one, boss?
- Not today, boy.

227
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,159
Jeez.

228
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,924
Terrific.
- Football faggot.

229
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,513
Salt pill up here, boss?
- Go get it, boy.

230
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,670
How long you been in this asylum,
Pop?

231
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,547
Thirty-four years.

232
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,854
Thirty-four years?
- Yep.

233
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,428
Last six and a half right here in the swamp.

234
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,891
Too old for reclamation,
so they made me barracks chief.

235
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,977
Aren't you coming up for parole soon?

236
00:24:54,077 --> 00:25:00,495
Thirty years ago, I made the mistake
of slugging a fish bull. Hazen.

237
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:04,544
Just my luck he made warden.

238
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:11,089
Sent me out here when I was 64 to die,
but I've been hanging on.

239
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:16,333
We'll all be in the same place a thousand
years from now, so what the hell.

240
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,802
Yeah. What the hell.

241
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:26,312
All right, you assholes.
Back to work.

242
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,613
Hey.

243
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:37,453
This ain't no country club, Superstar.
Move your ass.

244
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:47,910
No, no, son.
You've got to get off the bunk.

245
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,168
Man, for God's sake, get up.

246
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,621
On your feet.

247
00:25:54,721 --> 00:26:01,436
Listen to me. Nobody's allowed on
the bunks till five minutes before lights out.

248
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,892
They'll put you in the oven.

249
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,683
Man, that can kill you.

250
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,574
Did you have any supper yet?

251
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,393
No.

252
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,937
Later I'll try to get you some chow.

253
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,607
You got to eat, man,
or you'll die of mono.

254
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,830
And they could care less.

255
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:37,373
Get off me.
- Hey, watch it, man.

256
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:39,598
Where the hell you going?

257
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,344
Twinkle, twinkle, little Superstar.

258
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,678
Guard.
- Yeah?

259
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,527
I want to see the warden.

260
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,337
Pass the salt.

261
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,387
Boy.

262
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,687
Come on.

263
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,547
Go, baby.

264
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,485
That's going to get you
twenty-four hours in the hot box, boy.

265
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,839
I quit.

266
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,233
What makes you so tough?

267
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,922
I don't know. It just comes natural.

268
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,525
That'll cost you, boy.

269
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,472
Rise and shine.

270
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,766
Rise and shine.

271
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,524
Oh. It's room service.

272
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,736
Pretty gamey.

273
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:51,854
Shower and put on some clean whites.
The warden wants to see you.

274
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:55,572
The warden?
- Get on down there.

275
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:12,222
Well?

276
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:15,849
What do you think of my team?
- Mean.

277
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,436
Crude, but mean.

278
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:23,019
I was depending on you, you know.

279
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:28,609
Well, there's so little time left now,
it's quite a problem.

280
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:33,199
They need something
before that first game.

281
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,937
You have to win the first game?
- Right.

282
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,070
Well, it's relatively simple.

283
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,084
Yeah. Get yourself a tune-up game,
you know?

284
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,375
A what?

285
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:53,207
A tune-up game, like the pros have,
with a hungry team not in your league.

286
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:57,127
You bring them here
and kick the shit out of them.

287
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,227
Well.

288
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,889
How do you think
we'd do against the pros?

289
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,763
That team against the pros?
- Yeah.

290
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:11,148
You'd have a real problem.

291
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:16,609
Well, how do you think
we'd do against the cons?

292
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,402
I didn't know they had a team.
- They don't.

293
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,621
But you've given me an inspiration.

294
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:29,243
I've decided, Mister Crewe, that
you're going to put one together for me.

295
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:32,658
For that little tune-up game, you know?

296
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,991
And you're going to play quarterback.

297
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,585
I can't.

298
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:43,680
Why? They're semi-pro,
you said yourself. A big joke.

299
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:47,970
That's why people like me around,
my sense of humour.

300
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,574
Mister Crewe,
as old Mister Sam used to say,

301
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:59,324
'In this institution,
to get along, you go along'.

302
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,538
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

303
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:08,991
I'm just going to do what's left
of my eighteen months quietly,

304
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,826
and I'm out of here.

305
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:14,674
Oh, yes. Eighteen months.

306
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:20,552
But that is to make parole.

307
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:27,007
That was before you struck
Captain Knauer.

308
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:32,695
Your basic sentence
is from two to five years.

309
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,456
You could be here a long time.

310
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:47,446
If I get this team together, how long
do I have to get them organized?

311
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:49,546
Four weeks.

312
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:55,511
We're talking about early parole?
- I believe we are.

313
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,976
All right. I'll play.

314
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,104
What? I didn't hear.

315
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,645
I'll play.
- Sir.

316
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:13,191
I'll play, sir.

317
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:20,693
History. I read you
like a book, Mister Crewe.

318
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,774
One more thing.

319
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:25,874
What is it?

320
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,497
You keep Knauer off my back.

321
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,997
Give us a game, Mister Crewe.

322
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,844
I'll give you a game.

323
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:41,583
'Hit and be hit'.

324
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:47,463
'Anyone with any experience
or desire. Prison football team sign-up'.

325
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:50,650
Well, what do you think?
- No.

326
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,887
Maybe I'll get annihilated. Forget it.
- He's right.

327
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,027
Now, wait a second. Hey.

328
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,363
Here's how I look at it.

329
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,145
Suppose you break your leg or something.

330
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:05,607
That's six weeks easy time
in the hospital. That's biscuits and gravy.

331
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:09,027
Tell me something.
Would they let me play tackle?

332
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,571
Sure.

333
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:14,783
So I'd spend half the time looking
directly into Walking Boss's eyes?

334
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:19,177
Now you got it.
- I've always had a thing for him.

335
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,249
Walking Boss always had a thing for you.

336
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,295
Hold it. Don't you guys know
a good thing when you see it?

337
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:30,758
You get a free crack at the guards,
even a chance to kill one.

338
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,844
Legal.
- Bullshit. I ain't signing that damn thing.

339
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:38,194
Come on, everybody.
When Rotka's right, he's right.

340
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,521
This honky golden boy sold out
his own team-mates, didn't he?

341
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,065
Damn sure did.

342
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:49,480
Did it once, he'll do it again.
- Right.

343
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,041
Hi.

344
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,141
Hi.

345
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:10,089
You know you're doing it all wrong?
- Yeah?

346
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:13,759
Yeah. You'll never put
a team together with that bunch.

347
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,303
Well, I appreciate the advice.

348
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,208
I can help you.
I'm Nate Scarboro.

349
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:28,328
Nate Scarboro, Giants?
- Yeah.

350
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:32,326
Step into my office.
- Thank you.

351
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:36,710
I'm Paul Crewe.
- Yeah, I know.

352
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,743
You made All Pro, didn't you?
- Right.

353
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:42,548
Why'd you quit?
- It was simple.

354
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:46,333
Doc said, 'Quit football or walking'.
Too many knee operations.

355
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:49,169
I figured walking was better than sitting.

356
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,547
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

357
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:58,022
You got about 15 guys worth a damn.
The rest... How long did Hazen give you?

358
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,932
A month.
- Oh, you bought a bill of goods.

359
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,032
Didn't have any choice.

360
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,520
You don't have one black player.

361
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,649
There are at least 15 here
with enough experience to make this club.

362
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,749
None signed up.

363
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:17,239
I played eleven years
in the league, never even got a hangnail.

364
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,700
I'm not going to get hurt in this game.

365
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,245
I'm getting the biggest guys I can
and surrounding myself.

366
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:25,831
I've watched the guards play
for eleven years.

367
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:29,293
I've seen how they won and why they lost.

368
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:33,643
I know those bums
better than they know themselves.

369
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,754
You just got yourself a job.
Head coach.

370
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,742
Great bunch of guys you got.

371
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:46,280
'Strangled both wives with panty hose'.

372
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:50,233
'Triple murder
including body dismemberment'.

373
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,608
'Hacked mother with meat cleaver'.

374
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,151
Charming.

375
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,446
Double-check the ones with two stars.
They're the most violent.

376
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,546
Got any three-stars?

377
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:06,080
Damn it, Warden,
I think this game's a big mistake.

378
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:12,086
Captain, not only will you have the chance
to hone our team to a fine edge,

379
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,547
you'll also have the opportunity
to learn a great deal about life.

380
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:19,597
Why is it, do you suppose,

381
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,388
that I can walk through this yard,

382
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:25,061
surrounded by hate,

383
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,654
and in total command?

384
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:33,818
Because you've got fifteen gun turrets
all around you that say you can.

385
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,252
Partly, partly.

386
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:45,501
They could grab us right now
and slit our throats, but they don't.

387
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,582
We get the right person, right place,
right time, we can surprise them.

388
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,514
One game, one time. We can do it.

389
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,589
Hey, you guys about through?
Time's almost up.

390
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:59,689
OK, Pop. Hold on.

391
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:03,846
You better hurry up.
What have you got for me, Sunshine?

392
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:07,349
I can get you steroids, vitamins,
greenies, anything you want.

393
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,339
I'm the best hustler in the joint.

394
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:14,202
How much of what he says can he do?

395
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,794
He can get you laid in here.

396
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,206
With a woman.

397
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:23,579
What more can I tell you?
- Oh, yeah?

398
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:27,539
But can you get me
the guards' medical files?

399
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:31,588
What for?
- To find out who's had broken bones.

400
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:36,176
Sonny Tannen, strong as an ox.
You'll love him.

401
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:39,230
That him?
- That's him.

402
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:46,805
Hello, Sonny.
How'd you like to play some football?

403
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,575
Football?

404
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:51,977
Would you like that?

405
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:56,075
You mean, we'd really
get to hit the guards?

406
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,290
You like that, Sonny?

407
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:08,729
Report to the practice field
tomorrow morning, nine o'clock.

408
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,139
Cool it.

409
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,507
What's his name?
- Indian.

410
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:26,482
That makes sense.
- Now, don't do any ethnic jokes.

411
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:35,827
Indian, this is Paul Crewe.
- Hi.

412
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,273
I hear you play some football.

413
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,373
Little bit.
- Where?

414
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,391
Oklahoma State.
- Oklahoma State U?

415
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:46,292
Prison.
- Yeah.

416
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,952
First, we get you out of here
and on the football team.

417
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,052
How?

418
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,179
Well, we'll work on it.

419
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,811
That pretty heavy?

420
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,779
About 400 pounds.

421
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,433
That's pretty heavy.

422
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,447
George Samson Granada.
Mister Florida 1964.

423
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:19,231
Paul Crewe.

424
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,371
You know Florida?
- Yeah.

425
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:25,628
Yeah, they got tough cops here.
Small, but tough.

426
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,866
We're getting up a football game
against the guards.

427
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:34,661
Wondered if you and some of your
buddies here would like to join in.

428
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,550
With the guards?

429
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,393
I'd like that.

430
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,424
Sign him up.
- I'm way ahead of you.

431
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:48,584
See you around.
- Look forward to it.

432
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,948
Samson, huh?

433
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:59,292
Samson.
- Don't cut your hair.

434
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
What do you think?

435
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,611
Defensively, we can hold them
to two or three touchdowns.

436
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:10,386
But we need better pass receiving
and more speed to win.

437
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,969
To win?

438
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:21,251
I'm just talking about surviving.
Who's talking about winning?

439
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:26,808
So am I. This isn't just
a football game to the warden.

440
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:32,304
He shows you and this team up,
he's showing up all the prisoners.

441
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:34,404
It's just a game.

442
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:39,029
All I want is to survive it.
It's just a game.

443
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:44,487
Not to him it isn't.
It's a fear and violence philosophy:

444
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,611
a chance to be free for a few hours,

445
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:53,168
to try and be men again,
so he can destroy us.

446
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:57,871
Nate, if you're thinking
about winning the game,

447
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,096
you're as crazy as he is.

448
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:02,265
Maybe so.

449
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:06,727
But you spend 14 years in this tank...

450
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:13,053
...and you realise there's only two things
they can't sweat or beat out of you.

451
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,153
Your balls.

452
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:21,773
Better hang onto them because
they're all you'll have when you get out.

453
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,657
Goodnight, Nate.
- Goodnight.

454
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:39,288
Use of toilet facilities is suspended
for two hours until repairs are complete.

455
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:41,388
Sorry, men.

456
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,709
Mace.
- Yeah.

457
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,240
Follow my lead.
We're going to do this sucker.

458
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,468
Yeah, we got a line-up, we'd jam him.

459
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,993
Yeah, let's go see what this boy wants.

460
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:28,692
Pretty boy, we know what you want.
We don't play no ball.

461
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:33,250
Figured you did.
- We do but we don't.

462
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:36,194
There it is.

463
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:41,818
Weren't you two drafted by the pros?
- The pros.

464
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:46,146
I understand that, but we no longer
perform for the honkies' amusement.

465
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,369
Hey, man, I'll play.

466
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,528
But guarantee me that I'll start.

467
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:55,498
You got it.
- All right.

468
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:59,076
What's wrong with you, nigger?
We don't fuck with them.

469
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,871
I'm going to play football.
- But not with them honkies.

470
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,946
You better leave. We'll talk later.

471
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:11,620
Yeah, leave. You look better
going than you did coming, anyway.

472
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,019
What's wrong with you?

473
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,385
I'm going to play football.

474
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:19,638
Look, brother...
- I ain't your goddamn brother.

475
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:25,060
You know what, Granville? You're nothing
but a big old dumb stupid fool.

476
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,357
Makes more sense for me to be
busting their heads, than busting yours.

477
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,829
Oh, nigger, please. Shit.

478
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,412
Where are they?

479
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,285
They're not due for another
five minutes. What's the matter?

480
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:43,203
We're in big trouble.

481
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,999
I don't even know if these clowns
played high school football,

482
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,293
and we're playing a semi-pro team.

483
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:53,218
Plus, I haven't touched
a ball in seven years.

484
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,550
Don't worry.
Once you've got it, you've got it.

485
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,137
Throw one at that tyre over there.
It's just like making love.

486
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:03,722
Once you've done it,
you never forget how.

487
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,107
See?

488
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:17,446
All right, men. We're not going to have
time to run any complicated patterns.

489
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:20,532
So we're going to concentrate
on the basic plays.

490
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:27,002
But we might learn a few 'specialty
plays', if you know what I mean.

491
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:38,008
Naturally, we're going to try to get away
with as much as possible.

492
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:44,193
My executive assistant, Mr Nate
Scarboro, will be more than happy...

493
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:50,515
...to show you just exactly how much
you can try to get away with.

494
00:47:54,374 --> 00:48:00,114
The one thing that you're going to have
to remember, the most important factor,

495
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:03,298
is to protect your quarterback, me.

496
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:08,045
Wait a minute. That's no bullshit.

497
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,671
If anything happens to me,

498
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:16,964
if I get hurt, we're going to have to live
with the fact that we had one chance,

499
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:21,524
one chance in a million,
to humiliate those bastards,

500
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,735
and we blew it.

501
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:29,066
Is that clear?
- Yeah.

502
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:32,396
All right.
We're going to hurt them, right?

503
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,189
Right.

504
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:38,610
All right. We're going to kick
the shit out of them, right?

505
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,999
Right.
- What?

506
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:42,698
Right.

507
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:44,838
Right, right, all right.

508
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:49,470
Now, backs and ends come with me,
the rest stay here.

509
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:56,186
OK, linemen. Come on, linemen.
Come on out here.

510
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,549
What's the agility rating?
- Maximum is 10.

511
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:05,512
All right, just hit the holes,
I don't want to hear you hit any rubber.

512
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:07,612
Knees high.

513
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:11,861
Come on, let's go, let's go...
That's a two.

514
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,797
Let's go. Very good. Knees high.

515
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:19,332
Seven.
Let's go. Hubba, hubba. Knees high.

516
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:22,780
OK, let's move over
to the blocking dummies.

517
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,712
Come on, Sonny. Sonny, over here.

518
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,051
All right, Granny.

519
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:38,011
What do I give Granny?
- Six.

520
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:44,858
Seven.

521
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:54,031
Would that be a ten?
- That's a ten.

522
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:57,644
All right. I want to see you really hit.

523
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,702
On three. Hut one.

524
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,373
Hut two. Hut three.

525
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:15,962
All right.
Let's protect the passer this time.

526
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:20,852
Good idea.

527
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:25,023
Set.

528
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,984
Hut one. Hut two. Hut three.

529
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,864
Sorry, man.
- Nice tackle.

530
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,165
Hey, Coach.

531
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:46,246
Where are all those
specialists you promised me?

532
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,171
Jesus Christ.

533
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,541
There he is, Connie Shokner.

534
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,373
The very baddest cat in the joint.

535
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,876
Even the guards are terrified of him.

536
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:04,339
He killed five people on the outside
and two in here, with his bare hands.

537
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:06,133
That karate's bad.

538
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:10,100
That's before he learned karate.
- Oh.

539
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,202
What's he doing now?

540
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,899
Nobody's ever had the guts to ask him.

541
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,750
Paul. Paul.

542
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:29,119
I smell a rat.
- Hello, Unger.

543
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:31,408
Paul.

544
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,411
I've got something important to ask you.

545
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,372
I want to be manager.

546
00:51:36,472 --> 00:51:41,293
Caretaker's manager.
- I'm better than him. Let me prove it.

547
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:44,643
Beat it, Unger.
- Fuck off.

548
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:50,352
Paul, why don't you like me?

549
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:54,309
I'm crazy about you.
I think you're terrific.

550
00:51:54,698 --> 00:52:00,155
Friendship is something
that should never be taken lightly, Paul.

551
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:07,116
I really want people to like me,
but they never do.

552
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:16,630
I'd like very much to be your friend, Paul.

553
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:24,344
Well, it would be an honour
and a privilege, Unger.

554
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,681
Now, if you'll just excuse me.

555
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,898
Paul.

556
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:35,770
You sure about that?
I can't be manager?

557
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,480
Caretaker's manager.

558
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,947
If I'd have only found you sooner,
you know?

559
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:48,110
Good thing he loves you.
He burnt to death five people he didn't like.

560
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,210
Putty in my hands.

561
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:56,421
Come out, boy. Come out.

562
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,272
Hello, Mister Shokner.

563
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,291
Know how to play football?
- Yeah.

564
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,495
Good. Would you like to play football
with us inmates?

565
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:25,485
No.
- Oh.

566
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:30,709
We're playing the guards.

567
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:37,716
Yeah. I want to play.

568
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,594
He wants to play.

569
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,889
Thank you, Mister Shokner.

570
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,590
Now, remember,
nobody hits the quarterback.

571
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,811
Blue 28.

572
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,682
Set. Hut.

573
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:07,532
He broke my fucking nose.

574
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:11,068
You bastard,
you broke my fucking nose.

575
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:13,168
Calm down. I'll fix it.

576
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:16,990
I don't want to play this game.

577
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,765
He broke my nose.
- I'm going to fix it, OK? Here we go.

578
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:35,467
How does it look?
- It looks 100% better, doesn't it?

579
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:38,058
100%.
- It does?

580
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,278
Yeah.

581
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,975
He did that on purpose.
- No, he didn't.

582
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,663
Yes, he did.
- Tell him you...

583
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,376
Tell him you're sorry.

584
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,588
Please.

585
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:05,259
OK. I'm sorry.

586
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:08,362
OK, everybody.
Huddle up, let's go.

587
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,253
He said sorry.

588
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,839
Bullshit.
- He said he was sorry.

589
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,939
You dumb pussy.

590
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:22,897
Try it again.
- Three, twenty-five, hut, hut.

591
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:33,066
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

592
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:36,737
Outside of Crewe, the only one
who looks like anything is Granville.

593
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:42,107
Granville could give you real trouble.
- All right, that's all.

594
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:01,220
Well?
- It's going to be a turkey shoot.

595
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,972
He's right, sir.
We're going to destroy 'em.

596
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,452
It's a cinch, boss. A cinch.

597
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:08,685
Cinch.

598
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,785
Destroy 'em.

599
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,369
Too cute.

600
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:24,618
That's what you said last year before
we lost to Endicott Steel, remember?

601
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:29,456
There's no sense us taking any chances,
letting ourselves get hurt.

602
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:33,721
So see what we can do about Granville.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,784
Granville, get your ass over here.

604
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,780
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

605
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:51,937
What the hell you think you're doing, boy?

606
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:54,037
You pick that up.

607
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:02,990
Yes, sir.

608
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,874
What is your problem, fat man?

609
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:10,748
Know why you spades always
calling each other 'brother'?

610
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:12,291
No, sir.

611
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:18,596
'Cause half of you don't know who your
daddy is, so you might be brothers.

612
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:29,656
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

613
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,631
You think that's funny?
- Yes, sir.

614
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:35,378
You want to hit me, don't you?

615
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:37,274
No, sir, Lieutenant.

616
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:44,174
You're too ignorant to know when a man's
calling you a stupid, uneducated nigger.

617
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:54,549
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
May I go now, sir?

618
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,637
Yeah, get out of my sight.

619
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,451
Blue 48.

620
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:20,707
Blue 48.

621
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:25,422
Set.
Hut one.

622
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,137
Shit.

623
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,976
Hey, lightweight.

624
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:43,173
What the hell is this?

625
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,300
Here come the rain-clouds.

626
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
What do they want?

627
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:55,115
Granny tells us you need a little help.
Says you can guarantee no work detail.

628
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:01,275
Yeah.
- Guarantee special food like Granny gets?

629
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,818
Yeah.

630
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:05,696
We get to hit those guards
like Granny said?

631
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:09,247
You get to hit 'em.

632
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,413
What else can we offer them?

633
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:17,833
...having a Geneva conference
about playing with us.

634
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,933
What is this bullshit?

635
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,895
Well, Mister Crewe.

636
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:26,356
We've come to terms.

637
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:29,094
Compliments from
the Greater Chicago Youth Authority.

638
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:31,659
There goes the neighbourhood.

639
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:56,212
You wanted to see me?

640
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,430
Yes, sir.

641
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:04,271
...especially Unger.

642
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,215
Unger?
- Yes.

643
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:10,562
Unger has a direct pipeline
to Captain Knauer.

644
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:16,642
It's impossible for me to have
a secret practice while Unger's around.

645
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:20,687
I'm supposed
to reschedule the yard activities...

646
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:24,775
...for three uninterrupted hours
of secret practice?

647
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:27,413
That right?
- Yes, sir. Right.

648
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,863
And you will talk to Captain Knauer?

649
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:35,063
I'll speak to the captain on those matters.
- Thank you, sir.

650
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:37,413
Mister Crewe.

651
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:40,791
Just what is it you have up your sleeve?

652
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:44,586
I'm just trying to give you
a football team, Warden.

653
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:50,855
And along the way, maybe give the men
some pride and some dignity.

654
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:54,043
Of course, only for a little while.

655
01:00:56,114 --> 01:01:02,404
I know you've got something more
bouncing around inside that head of yours.

656
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:05,446
You want a game, right?

657
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:10,571
My men don't have a chance in hell
of winning that game.

658
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:15,516
You know it, I know it,
I just don't want them to know it.

659
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:18,051
OK?

660
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:27,679
Man. I ain't had steak like this in five years.

661
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,568
I ain't eaten inside in six.

662
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,124
What have you done for me lately?

663
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:41,310
Today may be the high point
of a long and colourful career.

664
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:44,895
Three, count 'em,
three gigantic rip-offs.

665
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:49,276
First, I've got a box of brand new
equipment waiting to be stashed.

666
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,112
Compliments of Captain Knauer?
- No less.

667
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:54,592
And the piece de resistance:

668
01:01:54,798 --> 01:02:00,037
how would you like actual game films
of the guardsmen in action?

669
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:03,792
Can you do that?
- Warden's own home movies.

670
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:06,293
Caretaker, you never cease to amaze me.

671
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:10,133
Never. But you said three gigantic rip-offs.

672
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:11,882
That's only two.

673
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:15,094
You don't want to ruin the surprise.
- Surprise?

674
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:17,319
There's one thing.
- What?

675
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,573
You're going to have to perform
a personal service.

676
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:30,173
What kind of personal service?

677
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:42,788
The warden's expecting you.
Won't you come this way.

678
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:45,523
Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

679
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:58,041
I'm glad you're not in the swamp
anymore. That can ruin a man.

680
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,763
Sure can.

681
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:04,691
We don't have a great deal of time.
We have 15 minutes.

682
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:11,069
The game films.
- Thank you. That's terrific.

683
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:18,543
Like I said, we only have 15 minutes.

684
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:42,479
Uh-uh. Won't go over the cuffs.

685
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:51,497
You do this very often?

686
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:55,532
I'm as far from Tallahassee
as you are, honey.

687
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,844
Shokner.

688
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:09,306
Shokner.
- Yep.

689
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:14,301
Hit him high like that,
he'll break your back.

690
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:18,801
Breaks your back,
he's going to break the Superstar's back.

691
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:24,098
Don't worry about him.
I'll get that son of a bitch with an empi.

692
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,724
Kiai.

693
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:28,149
Ready. Set.
- Kiai.

694
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,158
Ready. Set.
- Kiai.

695
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:33,565
Take this bandage,

696
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,901
dip it into the plaster of Paris,

697
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:40,906
wrap it around the cast,
and in 15 minutes it's hard as rock.

698
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:43,164
Got it?
- Got it.

699
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:47,595
This is a picture of Walking Boss.
- Yeah.

700
01:04:47,805 --> 01:04:51,417
He once broke his right thigh-bone,
maybe you can clip it.

701
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:53,502
We'll break it again.
- Got it?

702
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:57,018
Got it.
- All right. We can do it.

703
01:04:57,231 --> 01:05:00,050
Gentlemen, what we have here,
in common parlance,

704
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,650
is known as a set of brass knuckles.

705
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:06,318
...temporary disabilities.

706
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:09,735
Balls. Gut. Ribs.

707
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:11,952
You got it?
- Got it.

708
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,732
...the ball is snapped,
you go into your opponent,

709
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:19,987
blocking him with your left arm
and bring this hand up into his chin,

710
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:24,950
and I'll guarantee he'll be incapacitated
for the next several moments.

711
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,458
Got it?
- Got it.

712
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:30,831
All right. Here's the play we're going to use.

713
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,834
I don't think the guards
know this formation.

714
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:37,838
It's called 'Incidental punishment
after the ball is blown dead'.

715
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:44,439
Any man you tackle gets an extra elbow,
knee, or kick in the mouth. Got it?

716
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:46,653
Got it.

717
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:54,737
I am, without a doubt,

718
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:59,950
the finest maker of raisin jack
in the entire joint.

719
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:04,546
I'm going to call this batch 'Old Caretaker'.

720
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:07,159
Do you always keep it in there?

721
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:11,304
Well, it seems like a logical place.

722
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:18,891
Listen...
- It does get to you.

723
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:22,966
...you and me are buddies, ain't we?
I got you laid.

724
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:29,568
I got you the game film. I got you all
them monsters. I'm getting you drunk.

725
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:32,697
Yes, you are.

726
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:38,117
There's one thing still bothers me.
- What's that?

727
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,795
Why'd you shave them points?

728
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:45,626
I told you, for the money.

729
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,052
No, no. Come on.
Give me the real reason.

730
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:55,217
You really want to know, huh?

731
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,545
I never gave a shit about football,

732
01:06:59,645 --> 01:07:02,396
or anything else.

733
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:07,185
The only thing
I ever cared about's my old man.

734
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:13,364
My old man was blind,
never saw me play.

735
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:20,566
Shit, I've been a professional
ever since I was 12 years old.

736
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:24,066
Hustling nickels and dimes playing pool.

737
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:29,955
Didn't make enough money
to take care of him.

738
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:36,296
And I figured when I got to pro ball,
I'd make one big killing.

739
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:39,681
One big one.

740
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:44,480
Make enough money to set him up,

741
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:50,271
take care of him the rest of his life.

742
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:52,952
Then the son of a bitch died.

743
01:07:57,536 --> 01:08:00,074
Do you buy that?

744
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:05,899
Well, that's good because it's bullshit.

745
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:14,257
Why do you think I shaved points?

746
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:17,801
For the money.

747
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:25,226
One minute to lock-up. One minute.

748
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,341
Know what my problem's always been?

749
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,647
No, what?

750
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,810
I've always had my shit together.
Always.

751
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:39,743
My problem has been that I couldn't lift it.

752
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,660
I've got to go home.

753
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:50,107
Oh, you're going to be a party pooper?

754
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:54,507
It's OK. Some pro quarterbacks
drink all night long.

755
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:57,214
I know.

756
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:59,248
Goodnight.

757
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:04,804
Goodnight, Paul. Here,
don't you want to take one with you?

758
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:07,771
Lock it up.

759
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:11,605
Lock it up.
- Lock it up now.

760
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:14,570
Lock up. Turn off radios.

761
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:20,991
Turn off the radio.
- Lock it up.

762
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,991
Come on, boy. Move.

763
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:31,211
Want to be tucked in?

764
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,077
There's nothing I can do for you,
Crewe got to the warden.

765
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:41,623
Captain, if you put me back in the general
population, one of those guys'll kill me.

766
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:46,503
That's what happens to finks.
You've got Crewe to thank for that.

767
01:09:46,603 --> 01:09:48,672
He blew the whistle on you.

768
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:50,772
On you specifically.

769
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,878
You got the problem.
- I can help you.

770
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:59,856
Split right. Full back, dive right.
On one, ready?

771
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:03,444
Go left. Go left. Go round.

772
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,330
Twenty-eight.

773
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:10,959
Hut.

774
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:14,454
Way to go, way to go.

775
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,692
Let's go.
- Set.

776
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:37,694
Hut.

777
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:41,865
All right.

778
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:56,421
General call for lock-up.

779
01:10:56,465 --> 01:11:02,633
Let's do it. That's my team.
- All prisoners return to their cells.

780
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:06,161
Shop period 5 will begin in 10 minutes.

781
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:12,981
In ten minutes, we expect all men in
shop period 5 to meet outside cell block...

782
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:21,656
Cell block 3A will take first call for dinner.

783
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:30,194
Dinner rotation will start with cell block 3A.

784
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,902
We don't know enough about these guys.

785
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:37,197
Why don't we take another look
at the X-rays?

786
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:41,118
The medical files are on my bed,
get them, will you?

787
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:44,669
Who do you see playing flanker?
- Miller.

788
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,834
Get the goddamn key.

789
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:18,238
Warden. Warden.

790
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,338
Bring that key.

791
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:26,519
Come on, get him out of there.

792
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,123
Earth to earth,

793
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:30,430
ashes to ashes,

794
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:32,801
dust to dust,

795
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:37,516
we commend the soul
of James 'Caretaker' Farrell.

796
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:43,370
And now, the peace of God
which passeth all understanding,

797
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:47,338
shall guard your hearts and souls.

798
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:53,697
Unto our God and Father
be glory for ever and ever.

799
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:56,249
Amen.

800
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,672
Good afternoon, fellow inmates,
correctional officers,

801
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:19,383
honoured guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

802
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:23,887
This is Matt 'Killer'Farrell broadcasting
on the Interstate Correctional Facility,

803
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:28,809
the communication broadcasting
system of your state prison.

804
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:35,284
This is part of Warden Rudolph Hazen's
progressive rehabilitation programme.

805
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:38,652
This is indeed an historic occasion
as we sit here...

806
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:42,573
...in this marvellous
Edward J. Hazen memorial stadium...

807
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:46,668
...provided for us by our warden,
Rudolph Hazen.

808
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,173
All right. Stand up for the warden.

809
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,776
Just so you'll know,

810
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:08,098
we've posted armed guards
all along the wall...

811
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:11,268
...and at the public end of the field.

812
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:16,523
So if any of you were thinking
of mingling with the civilians...

813
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:21,553
...and wandering off with the crowd
at the end of the game,

814
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:27,291
we will shoot you.

815
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,971
Have a nice game, boys.

816
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:44,316
See you on the field, Superstar.

817
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:14,049
All right, now it's our turn.

818
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:17,993
Here's a surprise from the Caretaker.

819
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,897
Come on. Come on.

820
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:33,823
Born free...

821
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:37,783
...and life is worth living...

822
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:41,246
...but only worth living...

823
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,949
'cause you're...

824
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:47,752
...born free

825
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:53,912
Thanks to the men of cell block C,
affectionately known as...

826
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:57,013
...the Citrus State Cheerios.

827
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,334
The teams are coming onto the field.

828
01:15:59,434 --> 01:16:05,809
First, the Guards' defensive unit, led by
Captains Rassmeusen and Bogdanski.

829
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:12,431
Leading out the offensive unit,
the Guards' coach and captain,

830
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:15,236
Wilhelm Knauer.

831
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:18,103
Let's hear it for Warden Rudolph Hazen...

832
01:16:18,203 --> 01:16:22,066
...who has sponsored
today's progressive contest.

833
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:24,151
Let's get the ball game going.

834
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:28,498
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Mean Machine.

835
01:16:31,758 --> 01:16:34,166
They stole our new uniforms.

836
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:36,959
They got our uniforms.

837
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:39,181
That's right.

838
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:44,436
...all time great,
quarterback for the Mean Machine,

839
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,184
Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe.

840
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:57,154
The balance of the Mean Machine
with coach, Nate Scarboro.

841
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:04,771
Please stand and join Mike Syke
in the singing of our national anthem.

842
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,084
What are you dressed up for,
Hallowe'en?

843
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:26,630
I figured if you get far enough ahead, you'd
let this middle-aged kid have some fun.

844
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:29,186
Bullshit.

845
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,968
Call it.
- Heads.

846
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:34,596
It is a head.
You've won the toss and may elect to...

847
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:37,331
How did you steal our uniforms?

848
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:38,809
Cute, aren't they?

849
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:40,909
Have a good clean game.

850
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:42,953
So no matter what,

851
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,880
just keep sticking it to them.

852
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:49,208
Now, who are we?
- The Mean Machine.

853
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:51,419
The Mean Machine.

854
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,505
Mean Machine.

855
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:55,159
Mean Machine.

856
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,507
Mean Machine.

857
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:04,641
Hit that dirt.

858
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,526
One, two, one, two.

859
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:34,087
Ready, go.
- Hold them out and don't let 'em score

860
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:38,202
Check them out
Hold them out and don't let 'em score

861
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:39,995
Check them out Hold them out...

862
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:42,716
...and don't let 'em score

863
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:44,931
Three. Twenty-five.

864
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,350
Hut. Hut.

865
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:52,641
Kick was blocked by Granville.

866
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:59,649
The score now is Guardsmen 6,
Mean Machine 0.

867
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:02,101
Guardsmen kick off.

868
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:04,359
Good defence. Way to go.

869
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:08,440
Here. Here.

870
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,770
At the fourth down and a prize attack.

871
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,655
Mean Machine serpentines
up to the line of scrimmage.

872
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,210
Scrimmage is first and ten.

873
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:20,009
Tighten the line. Move it.

874
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:25,097
All right, here come the bad guys.
Pick 'em up.

875
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:29,140
Set.
Hut.

876
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:37,302
...in the end zone for two points
and a slashing tackle by number 61.

877
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:41,515
Bogdanski?
- Bogdanski.

878
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:43,434
Who's supposed to stop him?

879
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:45,610
I am.
- Right.

880
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:47,980
...goes out there in front of him.

881
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,225
A free kick. Charlie Blue Eyes kicks.

882
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:56,125
Taken at the Guards' 40.

883
01:19:56,338 --> 01:20:00,917
And he goes down
for an 18-yard drop back.

884
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:19,626
He's dropped for a five-yard loss,
by number 66, Wilbur Gillan.

885
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:24,906
...and he's fumbled.

886
01:20:27,244 --> 01:20:29,879
A Machine ball on their own 32.

887
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,080
He's making the pass.

888
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:36,287
He's hit by a vicious
diving tackle by Bogdanski.

889
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:47,285
It's going to be a penalty for
Bogdanksi for hitting before the pass.

890
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:53,541
So ladies and gentlemen,
that signals the end of the first quarter.

891
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:59,063
...Mean Machine nothing.

892
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:05,565
Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...

893
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,166
Scores.

894
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:18,502
Damn.

895
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:32,292
Settle down. Good hands. Here we go.

896
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:37,832
Loose showboat on the centre snap.
We're going to fake it. Ready?

897
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:43,336
And the Mean Machine will now line up
for the touchdown attempt.

898
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:58,433
That makes the score eight to seven
in favour of the Guardsmen.

899
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:04,158
Listen, guys.
If they fake the Walking Boss, cover me.

900
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:08,678
I gotta get that bastard.
- Bury that son of a bitch.

901
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:13,142
First and ten on their own 31.

902
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:19,130
Wilhelm Knauer. He's dropped
for a two-yard loss on the 29-yard line.

903
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:23,605
Give me the brass knuckles.

904
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:39,795
Take a good whiff.
Take a good whiff. How many fingers?

905
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:42,000
Three.
- Great.

906
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:47,409
If that Levitt comes up the middle again,
I'm going to clothesline him.

907
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:48,952
Now's the time.

908
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:54,557
Four three Mau Mau. Ready?
- Hey, hey, hey.

909
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:03,232
Receiver. Set. Hut.

910
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:05,481
Ball goes to Knauer...

911
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:13,727
Levitt was clotheslined,
and he is not moving.

912
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:16,947
I think I broke his fucking neck.

913
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,492
I think he broke his fucking neck.

914
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:31,652
I told you I broke his fucking neck.

915
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:36,083
I think he broke his fucking neck.

916
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:40,008
Sonny, if Knauer drops back
to punt, nail him.

917
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:42,631
You bet your ass. I'll get him.

918
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,731
We need the ball.

919
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:50,356
A little bit of safety here.
A timid or chicken kind of football.

920
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:55,151
Ball goes to Knauer
and he's smashed down.

921
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,994
Give me a break, OK?

922
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:08,073
Did you see that? Are you blind?
You're supposed to be impartial.

923
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:12,253
Shit. Might as well be
a goddamn try-out for you.

924
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:20,006
Third and long.
He likes to throw on the flat.

925
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:04,931
And the half ends with the score:
Guardsmen 15, Mean Machine 13.

926
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,716
We'll have the half-time statistics
for you in a few moments,

927
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:13,107
but right now it's time
for our gala half-time activities.

928
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:17,101
Any suggestions, sir?
- Give your team a pep talk.

929
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,442
Yes, sir.

930
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:23,244
You've got to be a football hero

931
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:26,790
To get along with a beautiful girl

932
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:31,000
You gotta be a touchdown getter you bet

933
01:25:31,215 --> 01:25:34,085
If you want to get a baby to pet

934
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:39,093
Hey, Crewe.
What kind of football you call that?

935
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,041
Same kind you're playing.

936
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:45,129
We've let you mothers slide,
now we're going to hang you out to dry.

937
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,435
Hey, Wilhelm. Hang loose.

938
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:54,596
Those bastards were good.

939
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:57,076
Come on, damn it.
- Let's go.

940
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:09,748
Call yourselves a football team?
Bunch of candy-asses.

941
01:26:09,962 --> 01:26:13,447
They're laughing at you next door.
Listen.

942
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:19,300
What about Mawabe.
He's a bigshot, man...

943
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:37,601
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

944
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:40,267
You wanted a game, you got one.

945
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:42,269
I never mentioned winning.

946
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:46,109
You never said
anything about losing, either.

947
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:49,499
I'll spell it out.

948
01:26:50,544 --> 01:26:52,237
We've got Unger in custody.

949
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:55,992
He's confessed to killing Caretaker.
- What?

950
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:58,368
He said you knew all about it.

951
01:26:58,468 --> 01:27:00,829
But you didn't notify Captain Knauer.

952
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:04,797
And that makes you an accessory.

953
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:11,303
You're full of crap.
- You sent Caretaker to that cell.

954
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:14,534
You are an accessory to murder.

955
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:19,098
You could be looking at twenty years,
and counting.

956
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,184
Bullshit.
There's no way that would stick in court.

957
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:28,744
No? Mister Crewe, you could be in this
institution until you're old and grey,

958
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:33,695
or until you're dead,
whichever's first, I can promise you that.

959
01:27:33,795 --> 01:27:39,964
You're going to lose the game.
And I want a 21-point spread.

960
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:44,471
I can't do that.

961
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:49,519
Of course you can.

962
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:52,435
You've done it before.

963
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:59,979
If I give you the 21 points,

964
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:04,364
will you call off the dogs?

965
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:10,446
The dogs?

966
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:15,936
If you've got the game in the bag,
you tell your guys to coast.

967
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:21,005
I don't want any of my men hurt.

968
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:28,095
You have my word.

969
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:30,799
Once we get the 21 points.

970
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:38,135
You know, there's only one thing
I'm sorry about.

971
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:39,678
What's that?

972
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:43,093
That you're not playing,
knocking heads.

973
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:48,312
I'm afraid I'm a little too old for that.

974
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:52,160
No. You never had the guts to begin with.

975
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:05,618
You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Every one of you. Candy-asses.

976
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:08,415
You know who's beating you out there?

977
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:11,490
Scum's beating you out there. Scum.

978
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:14,338
And that's the lowest part of the world.

979
01:29:14,438 --> 01:29:17,591
Those are the criminals
and rapists. The murderers.

980
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:20,344
You're supposed
to represent law and order.

981
01:29:20,444 --> 01:29:23,472
You're supposed to...
- Listen to this shit.

982
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:25,265
He thinks he's Rockne.

983
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:27,184
You're letting the flag down.

984
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:31,438
Go out there and do something about it.
Offence and defence play together.

985
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:34,575
Let's go now. Come on.

986
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:55,589
You're guaranteed a 21-point spread.
- What?

987
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:59,633
Because of your performance,
I was forced to make a deal.

988
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,969
In the second half we can beat them.

989
01:30:02,069 --> 01:30:05,973
I don't care what you think.
You'll do as I told you.

990
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:08,016
Mister Crewe will do the same.

991
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:10,116
Yes, sir.

992
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:15,816
When you and your mental midgets
are 21 points ahead,

993
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:22,121
I want you to inflict as much painful
damage on the prisoners as possible.

994
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:25,784
So you understand,
before this game is over,

995
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:31,834
I want every prisoner in this institution
to know what I mean by power,

996
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:34,174
and who controls it.

997
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:38,765
Do we understand each other?

998
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:41,436
Yes, sir.

999
01:30:47,197 --> 01:30:48,640
It's 15- 13...

1000
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:55,030
...and the second half of a surprisingly
close ball game is about to begin.

1001
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:01,780
...ball goes down
and is taken by number 36.

1002
01:31:09,553 --> 01:31:12,340
Set. Hut.

1003
01:31:12,556 --> 01:31:16,085
...goes straight back, he's getting good
protection and is looking for the receiver.

1004
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:19,245
Throw the ball, man.
I'm open. Crewe.

1005
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:21,354
Crewe.

1006
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:25,275
Crewe.

1007
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:28,938
Crewe. Oh, shit.

1008
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:35,687
I own that hamburger. Pass it.
- I was open. Can't you see?

1009
01:31:35,787 --> 01:31:38,337
Enough. I'm calling the plays.

1010
01:31:42,044 --> 01:31:44,044
Hut.

1011
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:01,714
First and ten for the Guards
in opposition territory.

1012
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:03,814
All right. No sweat.

1013
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:06,260
Crewe has been poor
in this last series of plays.

1014
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,554
Something seems
to have happened to him.

1015
01:32:08,654 --> 01:32:12,394
That last pass wasjust not
a Paul Crewe pass.

1016
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:15,489
Come on, we'll get it back.

1017
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:25,210
Touchdown.

1018
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:35,614
Stick it to 'em. He's going to choke.

1019
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:43,213
Paul Crewe looking to pass.
Gets a pass off and it's short.

1020
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:47,053
It's short and it's picked off by number 21.

1021
01:32:48,527 --> 01:32:50,527
We got it. We got it.

1022
01:32:50,821 --> 01:32:55,017
It's another touchdown for the Guards,
bringing their score to 28,

1023
01:32:55,117 --> 01:32:57,922
to thirteen for the Mean Machine.

1024
01:32:59,413 --> 01:33:01,440
What's happening?
- I'm having a bad day.

1025
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:05,039
Bad day?
- Yes. Have you never had one?

1026
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:07,660
Get off my back.

1027
01:33:11,508 --> 01:33:14,545
Set. Hut.

1028
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:20,459
Ball snaps back and there's a fumble...
- Fumble, fumble.

1029
01:33:20,559 --> 01:33:23,789
What is that?
- You call yourself good.

1030
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:27,520
Why did you change uniform?
Bullshit.

1031
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:35,307
Paul Crewe
is taking himself out of the ball game.

1032
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:39,395
Paul Crewe is limping badly.
He's limping off the field.

1033
01:33:39,495 --> 01:33:42,564
Pop Steadman's bringing him to the bench.

1034
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:46,829
We may have seen
the last of Paul Crewe for today.

1035
01:33:57,638 --> 01:34:01,885
Let's get this shoe off
and look at that ankle.

1036
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,754
I could give him one of my empis.
I'd knock his head off.

1037
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:07,756
I could be inside making wallets.

1038
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:12,956
Doesn't feel broken.
Somebody step on it or did you twist it?

1039
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:16,273
Twisted it.
- Golden boy? Superstar?

1040
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:20,650
To think we fought Granny for this crap.

1041
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:23,397
Really sold us out, didn't you, Crewe?

1042
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:26,483
Anybody can see he's throwing the game.

1043
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,963
Pull 'em down, go, let's go.

1044
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,822
Let's go.

1045
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:35,826
...at the line of scrimmage.
Less than an inch for a touchdown.

1046
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:39,093
The ball is going back to Keller...

1047
01:34:40,013 --> 01:34:44,518
A touchdown for the Guards,
making the score 35 to 13.

1048
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:51,675
With 5 minutes 58 left in the third quarter,
which has been all Guardsmen,

1049
01:34:51,775 --> 01:34:58,553
the score is 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.

1050
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:01,935
No point.

1051
01:35:02,035 --> 01:35:04,354
With 5.58 left in the third period,

1052
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:10,064
the score remains 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.

1053
01:35:11,086 --> 01:35:16,781
Kill that Indian mother.
Get that Indian by the boots. Get him over.

1054
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:23,253
Good blocking.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

1055
01:35:23,474 --> 01:35:25,474
Come on now.

1056
01:35:26,018 --> 01:35:30,438
Guards'ball, third and two
on their own 37-yard line.

1057
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:35,344
Knauer takes the pass
and throws it to Levitt...

1058
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:41,734
...Levitt takes the ball and he's going to
the Mean Machine 30-yard line...

1059
01:35:42,075 --> 01:35:45,409
...on me.
Jesus Christ. Another injury.

1060
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:47,993
Come on.

1061
01:35:48,207 --> 01:35:53,737
...number 74, Shop Steward, is badly hurt,
bleeding badly from the mouth.

1062
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:58,409
...ball goes back to Knauer, who
hands off 11 for another long gain.

1063
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:00,509
...another injury...

1064
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:07,173
...and it's Sonny Tannen.
He seems to be badly shaken up.

1065
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:14,389
Crybaby son of a bitch.

1066
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:19,778
Time. Another man down.

1067
01:36:26,036 --> 01:36:32,411
Superstar, what kind of deal did you make
this time? What did Hazen promise?

1068
01:36:33,085 --> 01:36:38,245
They're killing those guys out there
and you don't even care.

1069
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:49,219
He's right, Crewe.
You fooled the hell out of me.

1070
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:52,324
I trusted you and you let me down.

1071
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:58,677
I know you don't give a shit about nothing,
but I didn't think you'd sell us out.

1072
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:03,273
Granny,
better get back in there.

1073
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:11,473
Four three inside flank.
Ready? Break.

1074
01:37:14,585 --> 01:37:16,862
Ball's on the Mean Machine 48-yard line.

1075
01:37:16,962 --> 01:37:20,617
...ball's gone to Knauer,
he hands off 44...

1076
01:37:21,884 --> 01:37:24,009
...he's picking one up...

1077
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:36,757
What is it?
- Broken collarbone.

1078
01:37:36,857 --> 01:37:38,896
You sure?
- I'm sure.

1079
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:45,824
Officials are trying to break up that fight,
it's getting pretty rough in there.

1080
01:37:48,118 --> 01:37:53,399
Granny Granville is hurt. He's holding
his shoulder and appears to be badly hurt.

1081
01:37:53,499 --> 01:37:57,413
Probably a broken bone,
but he is on his feet.

1082
01:37:59,713 --> 01:38:01,753
Satisfied now?

1083
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:07,496
Jesus, Sonny.

1084
01:38:07,596 --> 01:38:13,546
The officials will assess the penalty.
15 yards for unsporting conduct.

1085
01:38:17,606 --> 01:38:19,606
Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

1086
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:25,197
That time you hit Hazen in the mouth,
was it worth it?

1087
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:29,278
Was it worth 30 years?

1088
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,699
Yeah. For me it was.

1089
01:38:34,998 --> 01:38:37,703
Well, give me my goddamn shoe.

1090
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:45,743
Wait a minute.

1091
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:51,928
Paul Crewe, number 22, is going back
into the game for the Mean Machine.

1092
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:58,601
All right. New quarterback. Shok, you're
on the bench. Move over. Here we go.

1093
01:38:59,064 --> 01:39:02,804
Makes no difference where you go.
- Fuck you.

1094
01:39:02,985 --> 01:39:05,875
Look who's back.
It's the baby boy.

1095
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:13,403
Set.
- Set, my ass.

1096
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,399
What is he trying to pull?

1097
01:39:17,499 --> 01:39:20,121
Hut.
- Uh-uh.

1098
01:39:20,335 --> 01:39:23,704
Get that Superstar.

1099
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:28,002
Behind the line of scrimmage
for a six-yard goal.

1100
01:39:29,678 --> 01:39:34,838
Show 'em who's boss.
Get them. They ain't shit.

1101
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:39,922
That's how it is?

1102
01:39:40,022 --> 01:39:45,135
They're in a huddle now.
There's the gun ending the third quarter.

1103
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:48,380
That's the quarter.
Let's change ends.

1104
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:55,771
Ball goes to Crewe. He's going to
pass on fourth and long-yard it.

1105
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:57,856
...holds the ball and goes up the middle.

1106
01:39:57,956 --> 01:40:00,251
Crewe goes up the middle...

1107
01:40:04,963 --> 01:40:06,963
That's it, Paul.

1108
01:40:10,469 --> 01:40:13,042
The line is set...
- Hut.

1109
01:40:13,263 --> 01:40:18,424
...he's going up the centre.

1110
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:24,397
Shotgun left. Shotgun.

1111
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:29,317
Hut. Hut.

1112
01:40:30,197 --> 01:40:34,029
Crewe's looking for a receiver.

1113
01:40:41,959 --> 01:40:43,694
Where's he going?

1114
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:48,469
There's a figure that graced
the Polo Grounds for years.

1115
01:40:49,132 --> 01:40:51,952
What are you guys so surprised about?

1116
01:40:52,052 --> 01:40:55,197
I'm not letting you have all the fun.

1117
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:58,384
Bootleg on one.
Ready? Break.

1118
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:03,271
OK. Come on.
Looks good. Keep it alive.

1119
01:41:05,566 --> 01:41:07,566
Set.

1120
01:41:09,528 --> 01:41:11,528
Hut.

1121
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:22,230
There's a first down on the 20-yard line.

1122
01:41:24,751 --> 01:41:26,751
Your confidence back?

1123
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:29,797
Get Scarboro.
- Son of a bitch.

1124
01:41:33,051 --> 01:41:37,512
Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...

1125
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,807
...by Bogdanski. Bogdanski hit
Nate Scarboro a cheap shot.

1126
01:41:54,907 --> 01:41:56,946
A reprehensible action.

1127
01:41:57,576 --> 01:41:59,576
Cheap shot.

1128
01:42:01,997 --> 01:42:04,462
Let me at the son of a bitch.

1129
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:09,987
Old Double O
is down and seems badly hurt.

1130
01:42:11,006 --> 01:42:13,006
How is it, Nate?

1131
01:42:13,175 --> 01:42:18,086
I love it. After all these years,
my first touchdown.

1132
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:22,246
It's got to be his knee.
I heard it pop.

1133
01:42:22,768 --> 01:42:26,253
Get him up.
- You'll be OK. Hang in there.

1134
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,955
Hey, Paul. You've got to do it.

1135
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:41,643
Screw Hazen.
- Don't worry. He'll get his.

1136
01:42:43,539 --> 01:42:45,539
Good old Nate Scarboro.

1137
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:49,961
One of the most beloved men
this institution has had.

1138
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:03,926
The extra point kick is good.

1139
01:43:04,143 --> 01:43:07,373
Tightening that score now to 35 to 20.

1140
01:43:08,647 --> 01:43:13,135
Blue Eyes can kick the ball ten yards,
can someone fall on it?

1141
01:43:13,235 --> 01:43:16,271
Right on.
- Then let's go.

1142
01:43:22,202 --> 01:43:25,439
Charlie Blue Eyes approaches the ball
and kicks...

1143
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:27,828
It's an on-side kick...

1144
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:37,447
And it's recovered for the Mean Machine.

1145
01:43:40,179 --> 01:43:42,930
Shut up. Shut up.

1146
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,605
You're stinking the place up.

1147
01:43:45,684 --> 01:43:48,851
Can we take 'em?
- Yeah.

1148
01:43:53,567 --> 01:43:56,687
Split right. On two. Ready?

1149
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:07,454
Set.

1150
01:44:08,457 --> 01:44:10,192
Hut.

1151
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:14,967
Ball goes back to Crewe.
Crewe hands off to number 30...

1152
01:44:21,887 --> 01:44:24,873
...23 yards.
Crewe's down on the ten-yard line.

1153
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,376
A beautiful piece of razzle-dazzle.

1154
01:44:27,476 --> 01:44:33,016
Paul Crewe reached
into his bag of tricks that time, folks.

1155
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:51,608
Charlie Blue Eyes splits the uprights
and that makes it 35 to 27.

1156
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:54,544
How we doing?
- Fine.

1157
01:44:54,753 --> 01:44:57,209
There you go, Nate.

1158
01:44:57,422 --> 01:45:01,041
I heard you were on your way in.

1159
01:45:04,054 --> 01:45:07,291
Hey, did they tell you
about my touchdown?

1160
01:45:07,391 --> 01:45:12,087
We repeat, with five minutes
and four seconds left in the fourth quarter,

1161
01:45:12,187 --> 01:45:15,927
there is now only an eight-point difference.

1162
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:22,931
Here we go.
- Can you drop-kick from here?

1163
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:25,190
I could try.
- Drop-kick?

1164
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,437
It's fourth and four
and we're going to drop-kick.

1165
01:45:28,537 --> 01:45:32,404
Shotgun.
Drop-kick, on one. Ready?

1166
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:41,666
...he's got to come up
with something different.

1167
01:45:42,176 --> 01:45:45,406
Ball goes back to Charlie Blue Eyes...

1168
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:52,586
I haven't seen one of those in years.

1169
01:45:52,686 --> 01:45:55,391
What was that?
- A drop-kick.

1170
01:45:55,606 --> 01:45:59,006
How much does that count?
- Three points.

1171
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:02,568
For that? Bullshit.

1172
01:46:04,448 --> 01:46:07,768
The score stands Guards 35,
Mean Machine 30.

1173
01:46:07,868 --> 01:46:11,397
Fourth and 21
for the Mean Machine on their own 39.

1174
01:46:11,497 --> 01:46:14,118
Crewe is feigning...

1175
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:17,138
...and he dumps off another pass.

1176
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:29,105
...Bogdanski saves a touchdown.

1177
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:34,281
Bogdanski is really wreaking havoc
on that Mean Machine team.

1178
01:46:35,979 --> 01:46:38,517
Quiet down.
Now, listen to me.

1179
01:46:39,233 --> 01:46:43,178
We're going to let Bogdanski come right
through. Nobody touch him. Got it?

1180
01:46:43,278 --> 01:46:48,267
I want to try something.
If it works, everybody hit him. Right?

1181
01:46:48,367 --> 01:46:53,574
Right.
- Split right. All curl, on one. Ready?

1182
01:46:54,373 --> 01:46:56,108
Red left.

1183
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:58,960
Blue 69.

1184
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:01,626
Blue 69.

1185
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,298
Set.

1186
01:47:09,221 --> 01:47:13,301
...throws the ball
directly at Bogdanski's groin.

1187
01:47:16,728 --> 01:47:19,278
Get off him.
- That's bullshit.

1188
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:24,178
They're unravelling the tangle now,

1189
01:47:24,278 --> 01:47:27,890
and there's a penalty against
the Mean Machine for roughness,

1190
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:33,446
and that pass sure didn't look like
it was an accident.

1191
01:47:33,954 --> 01:47:38,459
Bogdanski is staggering,
but he is up and on his feet.

1192
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:44,331
OK. We've got fifteenth.
Let's huddle up on the ball. Huddle up.

1193
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:53,305
Unbelievable.

1194
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:03,815
Hey, Bog.
Get out of here.

1195
01:48:03,817 --> 01:48:06,220
Come on.
- I know what I'm doing.

1196
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:10,317
Worked once, got to work again. Right?
- Right.

1197
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:14,993
All right.
One more time, on two. Ready?

1198
01:48:15,204 --> 01:48:19,332
It's third and 32 for the Mean Machine.

1199
01:48:25,547 --> 01:48:28,038
Set.
Hut.

1200
01:48:28,258 --> 01:48:30,584
Ball goes back to Crewe...

1201
01:48:32,179 --> 01:48:34,998
Crewe hits Bogdanski with the ball
right in the...

1202
01:48:35,098 --> 01:48:37,589
...in the nether regions.

1203
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:42,570
Once again, Bogdanski is down,
the Mean Machine is dirty.

1204
01:48:57,246 --> 01:49:00,858
He's not breathing.
- Do something. Try mouth-to-mouth.

1205
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:04,872
You want to?
- No way.

1206
01:49:05,462 --> 01:49:07,462
Ambulance. Help.

1207
01:49:08,757 --> 01:49:14,344
They are taking Bogdanski
off the field in an ambulance.

1208
01:49:39,163 --> 01:49:41,451
He pushed him.

1209
01:49:46,128 --> 01:49:49,544
You can't see,
you blind son of a bitch.

1210
01:49:49,756 --> 01:49:54,217
Hey, Walking Boss,
here's your crying towel.

1211
01:49:54,428 --> 01:49:57,429
You big fat-assed son of a bitch.

1212
01:49:57,639 --> 01:50:01,174
Go get off and stay off.

1213
01:50:01,393 --> 01:50:03,393
First down.

1214
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:05,214
Time out.

1215
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:07,314
Jesus.

1216
01:50:09,443 --> 01:50:12,638
Scooter, you want to hit somebody?
- Yeah.

1217
01:50:12,738 --> 01:50:15,774
All right. Tackle eligible.

1218
01:50:15,991 --> 01:50:17,991
Mawabe, talk to me.

1219
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:20,813
What are you doing?
- One step off the line.

1220
01:50:20,913 --> 01:50:23,357
I'll step on the line.
- Right. On one. Ready?

1221
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:28,700
Machine's ball, first and ten
on the Guards' 31-yard line.

1222
01:50:28,921 --> 01:50:30,531
Blue 28.

1223
01:50:30,631 --> 01:50:34,031
...less than one minute 57 seconds left.

1224
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:36,468
Hut.

1225
01:50:43,602 --> 01:50:45,602
Protest that play.

1226
01:50:56,156 --> 01:50:58,156
Crewe, call time.

1227
01:50:58,325 --> 01:51:01,741
Time. Time.
Time, ref. Time.

1228
01:51:01,954 --> 01:51:05,014
First and goal on the one-yard line,

1229
01:51:05,082 --> 01:51:07,234
as Crewe calls time out, with...

1230
01:51:07,334 --> 01:51:10,370
...40 seconds left on the clock.

1231
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:13,161
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1232
01:51:13,382 --> 01:51:16,917
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1233
01:51:17,136 --> 01:51:19,136
Mean Machine.

1234
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:24,126
Quiet down. Split right...
Joe Jack.

1235
01:51:24,226 --> 01:51:27,456
Split right, sweep left.
On one. Ready?

1236
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:32,523
Blue 28. Blue 28.

1237
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:34,734
Set. Hut.

1238
01:51:41,952 --> 01:51:44,772
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is really a ball game.

1239
01:51:44,872 --> 01:51:47,082
This is a great ball team.

1240
01:51:47,207 --> 01:51:51,882
They're giving these Guardsmen
the fight of their lives.

1241
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,452
Split right, roll out right, option pass.
Be waiting, Mace.

1242
01:51:58,552 --> 01:52:00,675
On two, on two. Ready?

1243
01:52:00,888 --> 01:52:03,972
Second and goal.
- Blue 20.

1244
01:52:05,184 --> 01:52:09,051
Blue 20. Set. Hut.

1245
01:52:10,606 --> 01:52:12,646
Crewe feigns the pass...

1246
01:52:12,858 --> 01:52:15,978
...and he throws...

1247
01:52:16,195 --> 01:52:20,275
...stopping the clock again
with 16 seconds left.

1248
01:52:23,035 --> 01:52:25,585
Flip right, dive left, Indian.

1249
01:52:25,746 --> 01:52:28,524
Now, if we don't make it,
everybody yell time.

1250
01:52:28,624 --> 01:52:31,514
Everybody yell time.
On one. Ready?

1251
01:52:36,507 --> 01:52:40,635
Blue 29. Blue 29.
Set.

1252
01:52:41,678 --> 01:52:44,216
Ball goes back to Crewe...

1253
01:52:47,226 --> 01:52:50,725
Time. Time.

1254
01:52:51,104 --> 01:52:54,049
Crewe calls for his third and last time out...

1255
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:57,094
...with seven seconds left on the clock.

1256
01:52:57,194 --> 01:52:59,489
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1257
01:53:01,448 --> 01:53:03,658
Where the hell's he going?

1258
01:53:04,535 --> 01:53:06,535
Let's find out.

1259
01:53:06,829 --> 01:53:11,483
Crewe has taken his last time out
and he's heading toward the bench.

1260
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:17,278
He's heading toward the bench
followed by his entire offensive unit.

1261
01:53:17,881 --> 01:53:19,881
Most unusual...

1262
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:24,705
I don't know what they're doing,
it's silent as a church.

1263
01:53:24,805 --> 01:53:28,792
It looks more like a prayer meeting
than a huddle.

1264
01:53:28,892 --> 01:53:31,336
Whatever happens,
regardless of the outcome,

1265
01:53:31,436 --> 01:53:34,603
this has been one fantastic showing.

1266
01:53:34,815 --> 01:53:37,760
We've come too far together to stop now.

1267
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:41,193
For Granny, for Nate,

1268
01:53:44,032 --> 01:53:47,947
for Caretaker, let's do it.

1269
01:53:56,086 --> 01:53:58,494
Mean Machine.

1270
01:54:01,466 --> 01:54:03,466
Mean Machine.

1271
01:54:06,096 --> 01:54:09,050
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1272
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:24,487
Hold it down.
- Cool it.

1273
01:54:25,866 --> 01:54:28,487
Set.

1274
01:54:29,912 --> 01:54:31,912
Hut.

1275
01:56:02,337 --> 01:56:06,927
Thirty-six, thirty-five,
in favour of the Mean Machine.

1276
01:56:15,517 --> 01:56:16,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

1277
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:19,865
like the fabled phoenix of old...

1278
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,691
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1279
01:56:33,911 --> 01:56:37,445
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1280
01:56:37,664 --> 01:56:41,329
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1281
01:56:41,543 --> 01:56:43,838
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1282
01:57:07,778 --> 01:57:14,148
You know, you guys ain't half bad.
- You're right.

1283
01:57:15,869 --> 01:57:17,869
Fuck you, boy.

1284
01:57:17,955 --> 01:57:20,493
Not today, boss.

1285
01:57:28,757 --> 01:57:31,544
History.

1286
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,007
We stopped 'em. We are number one.

1287
01:57:45,357 --> 01:57:48,643
Where's your goddamn power theory now?

1288
01:57:48,861 --> 01:57:50,861
He's trying to escape.

1289
01:57:51,071 --> 01:57:53,823
Oh, shit.
- Officer.

1290
01:57:54,032 --> 01:57:56,327
Crewe.
- I'm talking to you.

1291
01:57:58,745 --> 01:58:00,189
Crewe.

1292
01:58:00,289 --> 01:58:03,094
He's trying to escape. Shoot him.

1293
01:58:03,333 --> 01:58:06,528
Crewe.
- You going to let him escape? Shoot.

1294
01:58:06,628 --> 01:58:09,688
Shoot him, you... Shoot him.
- Crewe.

1295
01:58:10,841 --> 01:58:15,088
Crewe.
- Kill him. Kill that son of a bitch.

1296
01:58:15,304 --> 01:58:17,304
Shoot him.

1297
01:58:37,159 --> 01:58:39,484
Game ball.

1298
01:58:54,426 --> 01:58:57,061
Stick this in your trophy case.

1299
01:59:03,268 --> 01:59:05,890
I knew you could do it.
