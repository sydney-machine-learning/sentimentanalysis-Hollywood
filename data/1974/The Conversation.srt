1
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,991
<i>I want to go over to my place and start,
you know, getting it on,</i>

2
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,618
<i>'cause I'm just tired of this all.</i>

3
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,288
- <i>Oh, that's terrible.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

4
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,540
<i>Did you ever take ballet?</i>

5
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,751
<i>Weak ankles.
Do you have a quarter for them?</i>

6
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,796
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

7
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,654
<i>Well, what about me?</i>

8
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,074
<i>You'll see.</i>

9
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,992
<i>A lot of fun you are.</i>

10
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:49,455
<i>You're supposed to tease me, give me hints,
make me guess, you know.</i>

11
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,348
<i>Oh, look. That's terrible.</i>

12
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,225
<i>He's not hurting anyone.</i>

13
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,271
<i>Neither are we.</i>

14
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,899
<i>Oh, God.</i>

15
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:22,446
<i>Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.</i>

16
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,824
<i>What do you think?</i>

17
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,036
<i>I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

18
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,122
<i>Really, I do.</i>

19
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,458
<i>I think he was once somebody's baby boy,</i>

20
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,378
<i>and he had a mother and a father
who loved him.</i>

21
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,</i>

22
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,011
<i>and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?</i>

23
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,305
<i>Anyway, that's what I always think.</i>

24
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,766
How's he doing up there?

25
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,352
<i>I always think how,
when they had the newspaper strike...</i>

26
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,895
We're getting better than 40%.

27
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,732
How about the second position?

28
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,030
It's not so good.

29
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,799
What have we here?

30
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,802
Okay, come on, you little babies,
now, wet your lips there.

31
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,598
All right, give me some tongue.
Just give me a little tongue there.

32
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,932
Come on.

33
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,478
Come on, just a little tongue outside.

34
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,146
Nice, wet French kiss now.

35
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,981
Come on, a nice wet one there.

36
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,859
Come on, come on.
Pay attention to your recordings.

37
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,447
She's coming in loud and clear.

38
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,948
<i>Look, Mark. Do you see him?</i>

39
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,284
<i>The man with the hearing aid like Charles?</i>

40
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,579
- <i>No. Where?</i>
- <i>Right there, with the shopping bag.</i>

41
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,998
Well, that's it for Paul.
They spotted him.

42
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,209
Give me the phones.

43
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,295
<i>He's been following us all around,
and he's following us close.</i>

44
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,964
<i>It's nothing. Don't worry about it.</i>

45
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>We're spending too much time together here.</i>

46
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,137
<i>No. Let's stay just a little longer.</i>

47
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,578
I got burned, Harry.

48
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,704
- Yeah.
- She looked at me.

49
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,915
Yeah, yeah, I know. We heard.

50
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,583
Oh, did we hear.

51
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,836
What do you think?

52
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,505
I got some good pieces, maybe 25%.

53
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,714
Oh, yeah?

54
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,889
Listen, Paul, I'll call you in a couple of days
if I need you again, okay?

55
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,393
Hey, Paul, you going to the convention tomorrow?

56
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,686
You bet.

57
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,062
Hey, how about you, Harry?

58
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,564
Yeah. Maybe.

59
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,441
Little party like we did
two years ago, huh?

60
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,734
Hey, Stan?

61
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,779
- I'll see.
- Okay.

62
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,030
Here.

63
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,498
He's a nice guy for a cop.

64
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,709
<i>You go.</i>

65
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,211
<i>I'll stay here a while.</i>

66
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,213
Who's interested in these two anyway?

67
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,507
I don't know for sure.

68
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,011
- The Justice Department?
- No.

69
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,305
I figure it must be the Infernal Revenue.

70
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,849
Their tapes always put me to sleep.

71
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,561
Since when are you here
to be entertained? Here.

72
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,355
Sometimes it's nice to know
what they're talking about.

73
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,733
I don't care what they're talking about.

74
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,944
All I want is a nice, fat recording.

75
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,803
Hello, Mr. Caul.

76
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,222
And happy birthday!

77
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,516
Happy birthday, Harry.

78
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,521
Happy birthday.

79
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,349
Hello.

80
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,310
Hello, Miss Evangelista?

81
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,771
Yes. This is Harry Caul from upstairs.

82
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,734
Yes. Well...

83
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,403
Thank you very much. Thank you.

84
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,908
Yes, well, you're really very nice.

85
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,618
Yes.

86
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,620
But...

87
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,205
I know...

88
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,916
Yes, I found it. Yes.

89
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,754
But what I wanted to talk to you about was,
how did you put it in the apartment?

90
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,635
Right.

91
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,763
Well, what about the alarm?

92
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,392
Oh, you did?

93
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,732
Well, yes, I thought I had the only key.

94
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,989
Well, what emergency could possibly...

95
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,867
All right. Yes.

96
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,831
Well, see, I would be perfectly happy
to have all my personal things

97
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,292
burned up in a fire
because I don't have anything personal.

98
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,002
Nothing of value.

99
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,464
No. Nothing personal except my keys, you see.

100
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,469
Yes. Which I really would like to have
the only copy of, Miss Evangelista.

101
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,266
Miss Evangelista, how'd you know
it was my birthday?

102
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:51,895
I don't remember telling you.

103
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,149
Would you like to take a guess
how old I am?

104
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,651
Forty-four. Well, that's a very good guess.

105
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:03,073
Miss Evangelista, as of today,
my mail will go to a post office box

106
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:06,535
with a combination on it and no keys.

107
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,705
Good-bye.

108
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,910
Hey, Harry.

109
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,495
Morning.

110
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,247
Hey, man, there's an article in here
about the convention.

111
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,040
- It mentions your name.
- Oh, yeah?

112
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,292
Yeah. You're one of the notables
who's going tomorrow night,

113
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,377
did you know that?

114
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,379
Yeah. I told them I'd be there.

115
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,256
Listen to this here.

116
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,551
Listen.

117
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,887
"Among those pre-eminent in the field
expected to attend

118
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,933
"are Hal Lipsett and Harry Caul
from San Francisco.

119
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,479
"Kenneth Sperry will speak
on <i>Surveillance and The Law."</i>

120
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,440
Wait a minute. Listen to this.
Where the hell is it?

121
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,612
"Also attending will be
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan."

122
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,865
Since when did
William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan,

123
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,492
become pre-eminent in the field?

124
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,619
Oh, he's very big there.

125
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,496
You want some coffee?

126
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,962
He's the guy that told Chrysler
that Cadillac was getting rid of its fins.

127
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,967
It was a while ago,
but it was a big thing at the time.

128
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,150
<i>December 2nd, 1:00 p.m.
Shopping bag, Unit A.</i>

129
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,328
<i>December 2nd, 1:00 p.m.
Parabolic, Unit B.</i>

130
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,506
<i>December 2nd, 1:00 p.m.
City of Paris, Unit C.</i>

131
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,622
<i>What do you think?</i>

132
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,625
<i>I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.</i>

133
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,085
<i>He's already got everything.</i>

134
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,170
<i>He doesn't need anything anymore.</i>

135
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,800
<i>Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.</i>

136
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,352
<i>...get him for Christmas yet.</i>

137
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,145
<i>He's already got everything.</i>

138
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,231
<i>He doesn't need anything anymore.</i>

139
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,902
<i>Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.</i>

140
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,321
<i>Well, you better start looking.</i>

141
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,448
<i>Well, what about me?</i>

142
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>You'll see.</i>

143
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,037
<i>A lot of fun you are.</i>

144
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,916
<i>You're supposed to tease me, give me hints,
make me guess, you know.</i>

145
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,795
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

146
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,339
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Walking around in circles.</i>

147
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,011
<i>Oh, look. That's terrible.</i>

148
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,139
<i>He's not hurting anyone.</i>

149
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,640
<i>Neither are we.</i>

150
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,938
<i>Oh, God.</i>

151
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,608
<i>Every time I see one of those old guys...</i>

152
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:02,080
<i>Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.</i>

153
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,207
<i>What do you think?</i>

154
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,170
<i>I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

155
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,672
<i>No, really, I do.</i>

156
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:14,301
<i>I think he was once somebody's baby boy,</i>

157
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,845
<i>and he had a mother and a father
who loved him.</i>

158
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,640
<i>And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,</i>

159
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,352
<i>and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?</i>

160
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>Anyway, that's what I always think.</i>

161
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,235
<i>I always think how,
when they had the newspaper strike in New York,</i>

162
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,321
<i>more of those old guys died.</i>

163
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,033
<i>Fifty of them froze to death in one night.</i>

164
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,657
<i>Good afternoon. May I help you?</i>

165
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,368
Yes. Extension 746, please.

166
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,495
<i>One moment, please.</i>

167
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,623
<i>Director's office.</i>

168
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,750
Yes, this is Mr. Caul.

169
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,421
I have the material
and I'm calling for an appointment.

170
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,342
<i>I'm sorry.
The director has already left for the day.</i>

171
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,718
<i>We'll call you back tomorrow morning.</i>

172
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,095
<i>May I have your telephone number, please?</i>

173
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,141
No, I'm at a pay phone,
and I don't have a home telephone.

174
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,812
<i>Hold on one moment, please.</i>

175
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,403
- <i>Mr. Caul?</i>
- Yes?

176
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,780
<i>2:30 tomorrow afternoon.</i>

177
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,533
2:30 in the afternoon?
Is that payment in full?

178
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,536
<i>Whatever was arranged.</i>

179
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,290
Thank you very much. I'll be there.

180
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,995
- Harry?
- Hello, Amy.

181
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,498
I didn't think you were coming.

182
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,880
I brought some wine

183
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,676
someone gave me as a birthday present.

184
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,347
I didn't know it was your birthday.

185
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,016
- Do you want some?
- Yeah.

186
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,810
I do.

187
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,823
How old are you, Harry?

188
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,617
Forty-two.

189
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,039
Sweet.

190
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,131
Does something special happen between us
on your birthday?

191
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,049
Like what?

192
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,093
Something personal.

193
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,431
Like what?

194
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,436
Like telling me about yourself, your secrets.

195
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,539
I don't have any secrets.

196
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,669
I'm your secret.

197
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,381
You do have secrets, Harry.
I know you do.

198
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,632
No.

199
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,386
Sometimes you come over here,
and you don't tell me.

200
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:13,391
Once I saw you up by the staircase, hiding,

201
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,768
watching,

202
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,686
for a whole hour.

203
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,903
You think you're going
to catch me at something.

204
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,449
You know? I know.
A woman can always tell.

205
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,412
You have a certain way of opening up the door.

206
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,126
You know, first the key goes in real quiet,

207
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,837
and then the door comes open real fast,

208
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,007
just like you think
you're gonna catch me at something.

209
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,898
Sometimes I even think
you're listening to me

210
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,275
when I'm talking on the telephone.

211
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,320
What are you talking about?

212
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,365
I don't know. I just feel it.

213
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,659
Really, I do.

214
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,427
Why are you singing that?

215
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,639
It's pretty.

216
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,190
What's the matter?

217
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,692
Nothing.

218
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,444
It's just that

219
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,365
somebody else was singing that today.

220
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,033
- A girl?
- Yes.

221
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,703
- Who is she?
- No, no. It isn't...

222
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,204
- I'm jealous.
- No.

223
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,249
Just somebody at work, and she...

224
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,421
She reminded me of you.

225
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,637
Where do you work, Harry?

226
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,016
Oh, different places, different

227
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,310
jobs, you know?

228
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,606
I'm kind of a musician, you see.

229
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,695
Freelance musician and...

230
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,619
Where do you live?

231
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,454
I mean, why can't I call you over there?

232
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,124
'Cause I don't have a telephone.

233
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,670
Do you live alone?

234
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,054
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

235
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,932
Because it's your birthday.

236
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,105
I don't want people asking me
a lot of questions.

237
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,816
I want to know you.

238
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,447
Yes, I live alone.

239
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,621
I don't feel like answering
any more questions.

240
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,172
Your rent is due.

241
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,676
Here's the money for it.

242
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,291
You never used to ask a lot of questions.

243
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:10,003
Harry, I was so happy
when you came over tonight.

244
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,508
When I heard you open up the door,
my toes were dancing under the covers.

245
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,222
But I don't think
I'm going to wait for you anymore.

246
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,008
- I have a package for the director.
- All right. I'll take it.

247
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,178
No. I'm supposed to hand it to him personally.

248
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,472
I have an appointment.

249
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,683
- Are you Mr. Caul?
- Yes, I am.

250
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,020
A Mr. Caul is here. All right.
Make yourself comfortable.

251
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,773
The director's assistant will be right down.

252
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,773
There are some nice Christmas cookies there I made.
You want one?

253
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,984
- They're good.
- No, thanks. I...

254
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,474
- What do you see?
- Oh, not much.

255
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,101
Here's your money, $15,000 cash,
as you asked.

256
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,144
And these are our tapes?

257
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,021
I had an arrangement with the director.

258
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:19,108
I was to give those to him,
you see, personally.

259
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,904
I understand.
But he's not here this afternoon.

260
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,113
As a matter of fact,
he's out of the country.

261
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,575
And he asked me to get the tapes from you
and give you the money.

262
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,308
I guess I can just wait on this.

263
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,193
Now, look, don't get involved in this, Mr. Caul.

264
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,238
Those tapes are dangerous.

265
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,823
You heard them. You know what I mean.

266
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,451
Someone may get hurt.

267
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,463
Mr. Caul, be careful.

268
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,039
<i>Well, what about me?</i>

269
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,707
<i>You'll see.</i>

270
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,168
<i>A lot of fun you are.</i>

271
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,601
<i>Who started this conversation anyhow?</i>

272
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>You did.</i>

273
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,981
<i>I did not.</i>

274
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,901
<i>Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.</i>

275
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,451
<i>Pretend like I just told you a joke.</i>

276
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,166
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

277
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,627
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Walking around in circles.</i>

278
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,423
<i>Oh, look. That's terrible.</i>

279
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,467
<i>He's not hurting anyone.</i>

280
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,136
<i>Neither are we.</i>

281
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,723
<i>Oh, God.</i>

282
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,437
<i>Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.</i>

283
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,273
<i>What do you think?</i>

284
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,691
<i>Yeah, what do you think?</i>

285
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,736
<i>I always think that he was once some...</i>

286
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,700
Hey, Harry, what do you say we take a break?

287
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,703
Come on. We'll go to Al's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer, huh?

288
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,080
- How about that?
- No. I want to finish this.

289
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,915
I thought you turned those tapes in.

290
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,542
Stan, be quiet, will you?

291
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,960
All right, all right.

292
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,798
<i>Do you think we can do this?</i>

293
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,385
<i>I'm tired of drinking anyhow.</i>

294
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,512
<i>What a stupid conversation.</i>

295
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,055
<i>Stan, please. I'm trying to work.</i>

296
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
<i>I'm tired of mostly everything.</i>

297
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,559
<i>Tired of me?</i>

298
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,479
<i>Tired of you, but not today.</i>

299
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,941
<i>What the hell they talking about,
for Christ's sake?</i>

300
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,153
Stanley, please, I'm trying to get this done.

301
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,571
All right. Don't get excited.

302
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,281
Well, I'm getting fed up.

303
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,576
About what?

304
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,912
About your asking me questions
all day long.

305
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,623
Jesus.

306
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,458
Don't say that.

307
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,376
Well, for Christ's sake...

308
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,921
Stan, don't say that again, please.

309
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,924
Don't use that word in vain.
It bothers me.

310
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,302
What's the matter, Harry?

311
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,306
Your work's getting sloppy.

312
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,021
<i>Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.</i>

313
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,732
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

314
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,862
We'd have a much better track
if you'd paid more attention to the recording

315
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,240
and less attention
to what they were talking about.

316
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,909
I can't see why a couple of questions
about what the hell is going on

317
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,160
can get you so out of joint.

318
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,705
'Cause I can't sit here and explain
the personal problems of my clients.

319
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,171
<i>Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

320
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,466
<i>3:00.</i>

321
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,052
<i>Room 773.</i>

322
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,554
It wouldn't hurt
if you filled me in a little bit

323
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,805
once in a while.
Did you ever think of that?

324
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,474
It has nothing to do with me,
and even less to do with you.

325
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,395
It's curiosity. Did you ever hear of that?
It's just goddamn human nature.

326
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:35,317
Listen, if there's one sure-fire rule
that I have learned in this business is that

327
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,819
I don't know anything about human nature.

328
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,654
I don't know anything about curiosity.

329
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,990
That's not part of what I do. What I...

330
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,158
This is my business, and when I'm...

331
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,753
I'll see you later.

332
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,273
<i>I think he's been recording my telephone.</i>

333
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,322
<i>I love you.</i>

334
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,491
<i>We're spending too much time together here.</i>

335
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,535
<i>No. Let's stay just a little longer.</i>

336
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,220
<i>I think he's been recording my telephone.</i>

337
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,527
<i>He'd kill us if he got the chance.</i>

338
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:31,910
<i>He'd kill us if he got the chance.</i>

339
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,961
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

340
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,094
It's been three months
since my last confession.

341
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,429
I...

342
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,186
These are my sins.

343
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,316
I've taken the Lord's name in vain

344
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,069
on several occasions.

345
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,031
I...

346
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,913
On a number of occasions,
I've taken newspapers from the racks

347
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,957
without paying for them.

348
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,042
I...

349
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,009
have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts,

350
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,011
and

351
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,890
I've been involved in some work

352
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,978
that I think will be used
to hurt these two young people.

353
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,897
It's happened to me before.

354
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,442
People were hurt because of my work.

355
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,027
I'm afraid it could happen again,

356
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,948
and I was in no way responsible.

357
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,783
I'm not responsible.

358
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,496
For these and all my sins of my past life,
I am heartily sorry.

359
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,177
Hi. Can I help you?

360
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:57,514
- Well, you could explain your system to me.
- Okay, Mr. Caul, I'm Jim Storey.

361
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,267
- How do you do?
- Come in and take a look here

362
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,894
at the system.

363
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,981
This is for the surveillance
of telephone communication systems.

364
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,149
I see.

365
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,317
...now available.

366
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,527
Here's the new LT 500.

367
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:15,199
If you're in surveillance,
you belong into the LT 500.

368
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,951
You can hear your sounds here

369
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,495
and know exactly
which door has been violated.

370
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,622
I see.

371
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,498
And you got your local alarms on the doors,

372
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,958
which I'm sure you've heard.

373
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,418
It's quite noisy.

374
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,712
It has a Super 8mm camera in here,

375
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,006
and the dot right here, the 10:00 dot,

376
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,092
will show exactly
what the camera sees on the back.

377
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,928
It's a magazine-loaded camera,

378
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,763
Super 8mm...

379
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:42,476
<i>William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan,</i>

380
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,561
<i>house courtesy telephone, please.</i>

381
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,984
That's your automatic recorder actuator.

382
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,197
It undetectably starts the recorder
when the phone is lifted

383
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,450
and shuts it off
when the receiver is put back.

384
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,286
- What?
- It's real nice, you know.

385
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,373
It's not your old-fashioned voice actuator,

386
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,542
you know, always starting the recorder
when nobody was talking

387
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:11,380
or shutting it off in the middle
of an important conversation.

388
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,423
Is it anything like the Moran actuator?

389
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,593
The Moran E-27 is a copy.

390
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,596
I won't let him even smell
my equipment anymore.

391
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,598
- You in surveillance?
- Yeah.

392
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,934
Law enforcement or private operator?

393
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,227
Private.

394
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,313
You mind if I take your name and address
for our mailing list?

395
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,858
Harry... Harry Caul?

396
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,402
I didn't recognize you.

397
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:37,072
Say, I wonder,
would you take a Model 510-A?

398
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,949
Free of charge. Just to test it.

399
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,119
You know, say, in return for that
we can print in our flier

400
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,245
that you use it.

401
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,122
I build all my own equipment. Thank you.

402
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,166
Maybe we could take a picture
of you holding it?

403
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,335
Or take a picture of you
in front of our booth?

404
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,421
It would be a great honor for Spectre.

405
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,052
<i>This is not helping crime.</i>

406
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,261
<i>It's helping justice.</i>

407
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,654
...that may be affixed
to the subject's automobile...

408
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,906
Slide.

409
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,784
and will transmit a pulsating tone signal...

410
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,951
Slide.

411
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:05,994
which is highly detectable...

412
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,996
Harry, good to see you.

413
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,917
- Beautiful suit.
- You like it? It's French.

414
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,001
Oh.

415
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,587
Let's go get a drink and talk.

416
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,673
Requiring no knowledge or skill in electronics.

417
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,759
Come on, it's a bore.

418
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:29,601
The TA-30 may be installed and concealed
under the dash in a matter of seconds.

419
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,480
Hey, come on, there's somebody over here
I want you to meet,

420
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,689
a competitor of yours.

421
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,150
- Hey, Bernie, old buddy.
- Yeah, Paulie, what's up?

422
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,071
This is Harry Caul. William P. Moran.

423
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,031
Harry Caul, my pleasure.

424
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,575
My friends call me Bernie.
I heard a lot about you, Harry.

425
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,203
- Thank you.
- Bernie just moved in from Detroit.

426
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:52,207
He's the fellow that let Chrysler know
that Cadillac was discontinuing its fins.

427
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,667
That's right. I heard.

428
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,379
Harry Caul, you're a tough man
to get a hold of.

429
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,548
I've been wanting to talk to you
for a long time.

430
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,341
Hey, can you take five?
We'll get a drink.

431
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,051
Yeah. Maybe in a couple of...

432
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,430
Honey... Honey, sweetheart,
show time, all right?

433
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,641
I'd appreciate it if you stuck around
for the demonstration, Harry.

434
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,763
Ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,273
Ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,570
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here
is the Moran S-15 harmonica tap.

437
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:26,158
This electronic marvel can be installed
in a matter of two minutes.

438
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:30,036
Notice here it has its own
nickel cadmium power source,

439
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,164
so it cannot be detected on the line.

440
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:36,084
Once installed, it can be phoned
from any telephone in the world,

441
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,837
Singapore, Karachi, even Moscow.

442
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:42,382
I say Moscow 'cause you look
a little Russian there, sir, with the beard.

443
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,010
You just dial the target's phone number,

444
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,345
pause before the last digit,

445
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,098
blow the harmonica tone into the phone,

446
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,142
press the last digit.

447
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,479
The phone will not ring
in the target's house.

448
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:59,441
Instead, the receiver will be turned
into an actual room microphone,

449
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,235
thus enabling surveillance to take place.

450
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,198
And now, by way of an actual demonstration,

451
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,867
we've installed one of these units
in my very own home.

452
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,827
I will now dial that number.

453
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,371
Thank you.

454
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,046
I pause before the last digit.

455
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,424
Harmonica.

456
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,305
I dial the last digit.

457
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,728
You will note the phone does not ring.

458
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,480
<i>Can we get away?</i>

459
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,899
<i>I don't know. Maybe I can.</i>

460
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,567
<i>Where's your husband?</i>

461
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,278
<i>He's out at a convention.</i>

462
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,157
<i>When will he be back?</i>

463
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,784
<i>Not until late.</i>

464
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,662
April fool! Just a little joke, folks.

465
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,413
- That shows you the possibilities...
- <i>Larry Peterson...</i>

466
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,832
- of the Moran S-15.
- <i>Larry Peterson Burns.</i>

467
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,168
Thank you.
The demonstration is concluded.

468
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,754
I'd like you to take
a little literature with you on your way.

469
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,799
Well, what did you think of that?
How did you like it?

470
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,008
It's a good item.

471
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,843
It's good for the catalogue suckers, huh?

472
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,388
Here you go, Harry.
Have a free pen.

473
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:12,597
You, too, Paulie.

474
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,516
- I'd rather have a free drink.
- Hey, me, too.

475
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,563
Stanley! Stanley, do me a favor, huh?

476
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,690
Come on. Mind the booth, all right?

477
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,233
Come on. That's what I pay you for.

478
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,318
Just a couple of minutes.
I just wanna get a drink, all right?

479
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,736
Hi, Harry.

480
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,656
Hi, Stan.

481
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,742
That's right.
You two used to work together, huh?

482
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,789
You see that son of a bitch sitting there?
He stole my latest idea...

483
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,207
A lot of nice ladies around here tonight.

484
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,334
Say, how about that pastry in the yellow?
She come across?

485
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,087
Come on. Forget it. She's a part-time nun.
We'll get supper...

486
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,089
Hey, Harry, where you going?

487
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,883
You guys go on without me.
I'm going to talk to Stan.

488
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,594
We'll meet you later
at the chrome-dome exhibit.

489
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,512
Don't be long, huh, Harry.
Come on.

490
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,610
Since when are you working for Moran, Stanley?

491
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,615
Since yesterday.

492
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,909
Listen, that wasn't serious.

493
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,578
That was just a stupid argument.

494
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,871
That wasn't it, Harry.
It's just that

495
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,372
I figured it was time I move up, that's all.

496
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,999
No... Stan,

497
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,877
I don't want you telling him
about any of my things.

498
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,961
It's not ethical.

499
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,755
There's not all that much
you ever let me in on, Harry.

500
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:27,922
Maybe that's the problem.

501
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,343
Okay. All right. I'll bring you along faster.
I'll show you some of the stuff.

502
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,761
You won't show me anything.

503
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:35,597
You'll keep it all to yourself.
You know damn well you will.

504
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,183
No, really, Stan, wait a while.

505
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,644
Will you think about it?

506
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,147
Don't do this to me now.

507
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,235
Some guy's following me.

508
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,446
Who?

509
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,281
I don't know.

510
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,742
It has something to do
with the assignment last week.

511
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,371
I don't know what it's about,
but I don't like it.

512
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,541
Okay, all right.

513
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,336
Okay. Thanks, Stan.

514
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,258
This is junk.

515
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,786
<i>I'm sorry, but you have reached
a disconnected number.</i>

516
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,496
<i>Will you please make sure you...</i>

517
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,673
<i>Information.</i>

518
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,008
The number for Amy Fredericks, please.

519
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,885
It's a new listing.

520
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,721
<i>One moment, please.</i>

521
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,019
<i>Sir, I see no listing for an Amy Fredericks.</i>

522
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,731
Thank you.

523
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,798
What are you doing here?

524
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,800
Take it easy. I'm just a messenger.

525
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,969
I brought you a drink.

526
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,221
I don't want your drink.
Why are you following me?

527
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:43,224
I'm not following you.
I'm looking for you.

528
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,309
There's a big difference.

529
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,227
How did you know I was here?

530
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,354
It's a convention of wire-tappers, isn't it?

531
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:52,066
Oh, excuse me,
surveillance and security technicians.

532
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:53,860
It was a snap.

533
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,738
Look, I'm telling you, I'm not giving those tapes
to anybody but the director.

534
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,990
Yeah, I know what you told me, Mr. Caul.

535
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,367
All right, what's the message?

536
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,870
We want you to deliver the tapes
on Sunday, 1:00.

537
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,455
The director will be there.

538
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,166
He'll accept the tapes from you, in person.

539
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,959
You tell him I'll think about it.

540
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,813
- Hey, Paulie!
- Come on! Come on, let's go!

541
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,941
Lurleen and Millard, get in the back there.

542
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,067
And, Stanley, get in front!

543
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,528
Hey, come on, Harry.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

544
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,780
Come on. I'm trying to dress up for the bar.

545
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,033
Hey, Bernie, it's a come-as-you-are party.

546
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,453
Hey, no, no! Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!

547
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,289
I think you take a right
somewhere around here.

548
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,918
Sons of bitches! Those smartasses!

549
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,503
Who the hell do they think
they're tangling with?

550
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,338
All right! Easy, easy!
Come on. We're going to have a party.

551
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,714
He could drive, man.

552
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,137
Millard, make them stop.

553
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,682
Relax, honey.
Paul's the best tail man in the country.

554
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,059
Hey, Meredith, do you hear that?

555
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,776
Headquarters 111, I'm driving east on Lombard.

556
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:22,156
I'd like a rolling 10-28
on California 5-6-0,

557
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,702
Boy Adam Lincoln.

558
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,329
What are you calling for a 10-28 for?

559
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,331
Thanks.

560
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,380
Hey, Willie Sanchez, 565414th Street,

561
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,426
162 pounds, 5'10" and a half shithead!

562
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,267
You cheated!

563
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,354
Oh, man...

564
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,983
Want me to pick that lock for you, Harry?

565
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,446
- This'll be the bar.
- It's freezing in here.

566
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,991
Oh, boy, Harry. Okay.

567
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:08,077
- All right, the bar is now open.
- Thank you, thank you.

568
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,537
- Stanley.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:12,123
- How about a little music?
- The man wants a little music.

570
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,417
Harry, you got a nice shop here.

571
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,018
You know, I was rereading

572
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:35,939
<i>Dear Abby</i> the other night,
and there was this article, a letter from a fella

573
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,774
called "Lonely and Anonymous."

574
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:41,861
I think it was Harry. Hey.

575
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,409
Where's the club soda?
We got any club soda?

576
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,411
Let me tell you something about Harry Caul.

577
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,580
There you go.

578
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:55,875
I know you heard this a thousand times, Harry,
but let me say it again.

579
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:00,755
Here's to Harry, the best, bar none.
I'll drink to that.

580
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,839
The best what?

581
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,469
The best bugger on the West Coast.

582
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,096
And who's the best bugger
on the East Coast?

583
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,431
Me. I'll drink to that, too.

584
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,851
I'll bet you will.

585
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,693
It's really funny we never bumped
into each other in New York, Harry.

586
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,027
Why is that funny?

587
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,697
I don't know, we work in the same business,
the same city.

588
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,991
I figure we'd bump into each other.

589
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,993
I didn't know you came from New York, Harry.

590
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,285
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

591
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,371
Harry's famous in New York.

592
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,790
You know, the only one
I couldn't figure out though, Harry?

593
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,874
One what?

594
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,211
The welfare fund back in '68.

595
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,965
- How did you know about that?
- Everybody in the biz knew about it.

596
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,967
But nobody knows
how you did it though, Harry.

597
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,723
- How did you do it, Harry?
- Harry.

598
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,810
Ten cents a dance. Come on.

599
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,900
You all right?

600
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,237
- You hurt yourself?
- No. Don't worry about my head.

601
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,990
It happens all the time.

602
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,950
In fact, when I was a little baby,

603
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,202
I used to love to bang my head
up against the wall.

604
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,829
No, really. I did.

605
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,082
Sometimes I still feel like doing it
'cause it's comforting.

606
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,793
I tapped my first telephone
when I was 12 years old, Harry.

607
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,047
I mean, that's a fact. 12 years old.

608
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,925
It was a hallway payphone right in the tenement,
right where I lived.

609
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,887
Everybody in the building.
For six months, they didn't know who it was.

610
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:35,641
My father, he was proud as hell.
He was beaming.

611
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:40,188
Yeah, boy.
"That Bernie's got a real brain," he said.

612
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,856
From then on, it's been all uphill, Harry.

613
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,027
I got contacts now you wouldn't believe.

614
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,696
Here. Well, bring them over.

615
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:53,785
Take a cab over.

616
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:55,578
Nothing's sacred with you, is it, Harry?

617
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,915
Sure. The more, the merrier.
We'll be here all night.

618
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,167
Feel like I'm back in grammar.

619
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,212
- Oh, you son of a...
- What?

620
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,007
All right, what's the matter, Harry?
Can't you take a vacation?

621
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:11,260
You guys are amateurs, you know that?

622
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,137
When are you gonna get a new scrambler, Harry?

623
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,056
This one went out with the Trojan War.

624
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,767
Harry, come on.
I want to hear all about you.

625
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,479
- Where you from?
- Really obsolete, you know that, Harry?

626
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,024
- Harry got himself a girlfriend.
- Watch out, Harry.

627
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,654
- Where are you from?
- New York.

628
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,739
I used to live in New York.

629
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:37,161
Yes. First, I worked as a receptionist,
and then I got promoted to secretary.

630
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:40,581
And then I was promoted to gal Friday,

631
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,252
and special assistant to the boss,
and then I married him.

632
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,731
Do you live far from here?

633
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,282
Harry?

634
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,826
Are you still married?

635
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:20,997
Oh, I don't know. Probably.

636
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,959
I guess maybe I am.

637
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,837
Last time I heard, he was...

638
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,840
Well, he was trying to scrape up enough money

639
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:34,302
- to buy another hardware store.
- Yeah.

640
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:38,973
And I ended up out here
in San Francisco, unemployed,

641
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:42,894
which is the entire story of my life
up until tonight.

642
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,076
Here's to you.

643
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,416
You don't like me very much, do you?
You don't want to talk to me or anything.

644
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,251
I didn't say that.

645
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,684
Something is on your mind.
I wish you'd tell me.

646
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,354
I really do. I wish that...

647
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:29,941
I wish that you'd feel
that you could talk to me

648
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,151
and that we could be friends.

649
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,154
I mean, aside from all of this junk.

650
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,595
Would you...

651
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,683
If you were a girl who'd waited for someone...

652
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,069
You can trust me.

653
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:23,995
Well, you never really knew
when he was going to come to see you.

654
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:29,750
You just lived in a room alone,
and you knew nothing about him.

655
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,586
And if you loved him,
you were patient with him,

656
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:39,218
and even though he didn't dare ever tell you
anything about himself personally,

657
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,016
even though he may have loved you,
would you...

658
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,894
- Would I what?
- Would you...

659
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,942
Would you go back to him?

660
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:04,493
Well, how would I know?
How would I know that he loved me?

661
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:15,546
You'd have no way of knowing.

662
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,185
Hey, Harry!

663
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,521
Did you hear the one
about the broad who busted Vegas?

664
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:35,191
She wore a see-through blouse.

665
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,960
You know something, Harry?

666
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,338
Twelve years ago,
I recorded every telephone call

667
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,716
made by the presidential nominee
of a major political party.

668
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,718
I don't want to say which party.

669
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:48,764
But everywhere he went, that's where I was.
Coast to coast, I was listening, Harry.

670
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:53,185
I'm not saying I elected
the President of the United States, but

671
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,688
you can draw your own conclusions, Harry.

672
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,150
- I mean, he lost.
- Harry,

673
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,403
tell them about the time
you put the bug in the parakeet.

674
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:05,906
- Parakeet?
- No kidding.

675
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,743
Harry one time actually put a microphone
in a little parakeet.

676
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,328
Is that right?

677
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,041
Parakeets don't happen to be my thing, Harry,

678
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,670
but I sure would like to know
how you did the teamster local back in '68.

679
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,921
What was that?

680
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:24,341
- Don't you get papers in Chicago, Millard?
- Probably out on strike.

681
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,719
It was all over the front pages.

682
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,264
Harry was working for the
attorney general's office at the time.

683
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,558
You didn't know I knew that, did you, Harry?

684
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,060
Anyway, the president of this teamster
local back east

685
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:38,606
set up a phony welfare fund, right?

686
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:43,235
I mean, you correct me on the details, Harry.
I may be a little fuzzy on them.

687
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,196
There was only two people
that seemed to know about it,

688
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,072
the president and his accountant.

689
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,034
They only talked about it
on fishing trips that they went on.

690
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,412
On a private boat.
That was the only place they talked details.

691
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:56,540
And that boat was bug-proof.
I happen to know that for a fact, Harry.

692
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,210
They wouldn't even strike up a conversation

693
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:02,254
if there was another boat
even on the horizon.

694
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:06,133
That didn't stop Harry though, did it?
No, he recorded everything.

695
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:10,095
Nobody knows how you did it though, Harry.
Caused a hell of a scandal, too.

696
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,180
Why?

697
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,768
Why? No reason.
Three people were murdered, that's all.

698
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,145
Harry's a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it though.

699
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,193
It had nothing to do with me.
I just turned in the tapes.

700
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,570
The president thought the accountant had talked.

701
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:32,493
- Well, nobody really knows for sure.
- That's right.

702
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,828
Three days later,
they found the accountant, his wife and kid,

703
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,831
they were all naked and tied up in the house.

704
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:42,836
Hands and feet tied up with rope,
all the hair on their bodies shaved off.

705
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,005
Their heads were found in different places.

706
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,342
- They killed them?
- No. They gift-wrapped them.

707
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:52,012
No, no, no. This is ancient history now.
Harry, how did you do it?

708
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,723
What they do with the tapes
is their own business.

709
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,350
That's the first time
I heard about you, Harry.

710
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,144
Next thing I knew,
you moved out of New York.

711
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,938
It had nothing to do with me.

712
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:04,525
Come on, Harry, show and tell.
How did you do it?

713
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,110
For God's sake, Harry, tell him!

714
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,118
- Turn it off, Stan.
- What for?

715
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,620
Stan, turn it off!

716
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,789
They ought to hear this, Harry.

717
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,125
It's the best thing you've ever done!

718
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,464
What was that, Stan?

719
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,929
Well, it's the assignment
that Harry did this week.

720
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,600
- It'll make history.
- Yeah?

721
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,395
I bet you there's no moment between human beings
that I cannot record,

722
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,480
and there's no method
that I cannot figure out.

723
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,901
I could figure out any of Harry's schemes, right?

724
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,236
Come on, come on. Try me.

725
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:54,408
- Let me give him the assignment, Harry.
- Yeah.

726
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,916
Now, this is a quad in the center of the city.
All right?

727
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:06,795
Now, these are steps coming in here
and benches all around.

728
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,047
It's 12:00 noon,

729
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,256
which means that it's lunchtime for

730
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:12,593
all the people that work
in these offices around here.

731
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,679
People are walking, talking, having lunch,
and it's crowded.

732
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,973
- Naturally. Come on, Stan.
- Okay.

733
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,058
Now, two people

734
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,645
are constantly moving in circles,
in and out of the crowd.

735
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,688
We don't know whether
they'll sit down or what.

736
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:27,691
They're convinced that
they can't be recorded

737
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,444
because they're in a crowd
and constantly moving. Yet,

738
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,529
they're the target.

739
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:35,491
Now, the assignment is
to get everything they say.

740
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,575
How would you do it?

741
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,620
First of all, one system won't do it.

742
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,206
- Hell, I could've told you that.
- Yeah, why didn't you?

743
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,791
Go on, figure it out.

744
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,126
Second of all, it's easy.
All you do is get to their clothes first.

745
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,544
You pre-rig their clothes.

746
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,923
No. There's no way of telling
what they're going to be wearing.

747
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,883
Then you get somebody to bump into them.

748
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,762
You just get a drunk or something,
bump into them, you plant a pin mike on them.

749
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,555
They've been bugged before.
It's too risky.

750
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,058
I got it.

751
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,395
You hire a lip-reader with binoculars.

752
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,482
- No. The client wants their actual voice.
- Why?

753
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,402
So he can believe it.

754
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:15,489
All right. I'll figure it out.

755
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,074
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.

756
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,285
- Who was so interested?
- Yeah, was it us?

757
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:22,287
- Who's us?
- Federal government.

758
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,623
Private party.

759
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,417
It would take at least four passes.

760
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,877
- I did it in three.
- Three?

761
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,004
That's very nice, Harry.
What did you use?

762
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:36,093
Three-stage directional microphones
with MOSFET amplifier of my own design.

763
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:40,180
And we got another 20% conventionally,
just tailing them. Paul did.

764
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,265
Beautiful.

765
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,726
It really was. It was a work of art.

766
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,522
You should have seen it, though.
These new microphones are just incredible.

767
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,190
I couldn't really believe it myself.

768
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:54,027
We were over 200 yards away.
It was absolutely readable. Everything.

769
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,989
I broke in a couple of newsreel cameramen, and...

770
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,490
You should have been there, Bernie.
It was really...

771
01:07:58,575 --> 01:07:59,575
What did they do?

772
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,368
Well, they took

773
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,037
the crosshairs of the telescope
and they lined it up on the mouths...

774
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,457
No. The boy and the girl.
What did they do?

775
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:11,920
Oh, I don't know. But it was really beautiful,
really something to see.

776
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,715
Yeah. Sounds very pretty.

777
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,467
I'd like to take a look at that mike, too.

778
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,885
There it is.

779
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,222
I always said we should be partners, Harry.

780
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,224
I mean, I always said you're the best, right?

781
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,226
But you and me together, that'd be tops.

782
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,562
All I need is a quick look
at some of your plans and devices.

783
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:32,065
You know, just get an idea...
I got all the manufacturing plants.

784
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,068
We could make a fortune
selling stuff to Uncle Sam, Harry.

785
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:38,322
Listen, did you hear
about the fag wire-tapper

786
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:42,159
- who could only tap a Princess phone?
- No.

787
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:50,334
Made that up yourself, huh?
It's pretty funny.

788
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,044
Excuse me, can I cut in?

789
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,837
He's got a hell of a sense of humor.

790
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,633
I'm talking about making millions,
he's making with the jokes.

791
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,510
- Come on!
- Thanks a lot.

792
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,014
What do you say, Harry? Come on.

793
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,808
How about going into a partnership, Harry?

794
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,142
I could use a partner, so could you.

795
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:10,562
- 50-50, how about it?
- I don't need anyone.

796
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:11,647
No, no.

797
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,652
That's all right.
I do pretty good on my own, anyway.

798
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,613
You got to give credit
where credit's due, right?

799
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,198
Abracadabra, Harry.

800
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,786
See, I'm number two, Harry.
I have to try harder.

801
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,581
<i>If you were a girl
who'd waited for someone...</i>

802
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,916
<i>You can trust me.</i>

803
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:34,628
Harry, that's you and me
when we were out there.

804
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,380
What? No shit.

805
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,006
<i>...when he was going to come to see you.</i>

806
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:41,009
It's the Moran Super P-7
pen mike and transmitter.

807
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,012
That's terrific! The bugger got bugged, huh?

808
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,681
He got you, Harry.

809
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,808
<i>And if you loved him,
you were patient with him,</i>

810
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:54,314
<i>and even though he didn't dare ever tell you
anything about himself personally,</i>

811
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,150
<i>even though he may have loved you,
would you...</i>

812
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,986
That was wild. When did you do that?

813
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,655
Hey, how do you like it, Harry?
What do you think about it, huh?

814
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:07,077
<i>Would you... Would you go back to him?</i>

815
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,581
I think you'd better turn it off
and get out.

816
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:11,874
<i>You'd have no way of knowing.</i>

817
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,294
Are you kidding?
It's just a joke, for Christ's sake.

818
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,963
Bernie, Harry don't like you
to say "Christ's sake."

819
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,091
Oh, no? Well, I'm sorry, Harry. I apologize.
What, are you crazy, too, Stanley?

820
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,801
Hey, Harry. What's wrong?

821
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,761
Come on. Let's have a party here.
What do you say?

822
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,513
Paul, it's getting late.

823
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:27,890
Come on, take it easy.

824
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,641
Come on.

825
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,935
- Hey, Millard.
- Know what these things cost, Harry?

826
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,730
This cost 1,500 beans. Come on.
On the house, from me to you.

827
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,527
Very nice to meet you.

828
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,113
It was only a joke.

829
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,159
- Meredith?
- Guy's got no sense of humor.

830
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,370
- No. I'm going to stay here.
- Paul!

831
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,582
Okay.

832
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,629
I forgot my bag.

833
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,008
Harry, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

834
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,011
- Come on, Stan.
- See you Monday, Harry.

835
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,640
You want us to put the lights out?

836
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,912
- Good night, Harry!
- Yeah. Good night, Harry.

837
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,127
<i>What do you think?</i>

838
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,421
<i>I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.</i>

839
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,007
<i>He's already got everything.</i>

840
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,602
Harry, are you going to give me
a hard time tonight? Harry!

841
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:01,858
Harry! Come on. Come back.
Turn it off.

842
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,790
She's frightened.

843
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,293
This is where she's frightened.

844
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,087
<i>I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.</i>

845
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,506
This is no ordinary conversation.

846
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,760
- <i>He doesn't need anything anymore.</i>
- It makes me feel...

847
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,638
<i>Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.</i>

848
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:36,727
- something.
- Forget it, Harry. It's only a trick.

849
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:38,979
- What?
- A job.

850
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,149
You're not supposed to feel anything about it.

851
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,777
You're just supposed to do it. That's all.

852
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,237
Relax, honey.

853
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,405
<i>A lot of fun you are.</i>

854
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,198
- Relax.
- <i>You're supposed to tease me,</i>

855
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,576
<i>give me hints, make me guess, you know.</i>

856
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,329
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

857
01:12:56,414 --> 01:13:00,292
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Walking around in circles.</i>

858
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:06,173
<i>Oh, look. That's terrible.</i>

859
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,216
<i>He's not hurting anyone.</i>

860
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,469
Come on.

861
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,138
<i>Neither are we.</i>

862
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,602
- <i>Oh, God.</i>
- "Oh, God."

863
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:23,065
Listen to the way she says, "Oh, God."

864
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,941
Come here.

865
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:30,697
<i>Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.</i>

866
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,949
<i>What do you think?</i>

867
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:36,745
<i>I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

868
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,291
<i>Really, I do.</i>

869
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,503
<i>I think he was once somebody's baby boy,</i>

870
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,339
<i>and he had a mother and a father
who loved him.</i>

871
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:51,384
<i>And now there he is,
half-dead on a park bench,</i>

872
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:55,055
<i>and where are his mother or his father,
all his uncles now?</i>

873
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,602
<i>Anyway, that's what I always think.</i>

874
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:05,565
<i>I always think how,
when they had the newspaper strike in New York,</i>

875
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,567
<i>more of those old guys died.</i>

876
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,237
<i>Fifty of them froze to death in one night.</i>

877
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:13,115
<i>Just because there were no newspapers?</i>

878
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:17,494
- <i>Really. Keeps them warm.</i>
- <i>That's terrible.</i>

879
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,331
<i>Who started this conversation, anyhow?</i>

880
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,461
- <i>You did.</i>
- <i>Did not.</i>

881
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:30,006
<i>Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.</i>

882
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,594
<i>Pretend like I just told you a joke.</i>

883
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:41,268
- <i>Where did you hear that?</i>
- <i>That's my secret.</i>

884
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:47,607
<i>Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.</i>

885
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,944
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

886
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,240
<i>Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

887
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,368
<i>3:00.</i>

888
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,328
<i>Room 773.</i>

889
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:01,955
<i>Look, Mark. Do you see him?</i>

890
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,291
<i>The man with the hearing aid like Charles?

891
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:07,836
- <i>No. Where?</i>
- <i>Right there, with the shopping bag.</i>

892
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,798
<i>He's been following us all around,
and he's following us close.</i>

893
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,385
<i>It's nothing. Don't worry about it.</i>

894
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,353
Angel...

895
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:30,108
<i>God, it will be so good
to be finished with all this.</i>

896
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,069
<i>I love you.</i>

897
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,240
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

898
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:39,367
<i>We're spending too much time together here.</i>

899
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,828
<i>No. Let's stay just a little longer.</i>

900
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,542
"Kill us."

901
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,296
He'd kill them if he had a chance.

902
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,173
<i>He'd kill us if he got the chance.</i>

903
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,591
Oh, God, what I have done.

904
01:15:56,427 --> 01:16:00,722
I have to destroy the tapes.
I can't let it happen again.

905
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,808
It's true.

906
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:06,019
- <i>I'd better get back. It's almost 2:00.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, please, don't go.</i>

907
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,772
A family was murdered because of me.

908
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:14,361
I know. I know, Harry.

909
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,029
Everything will turn out.

910
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,742
Oh, God. There's no protection.

911
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,954
I follow them wherever they're going.
And I can hear them.

912
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,163
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

913
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:27,540
<i>Oh, wait, you have something in your eye.</i>

914
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:31,419
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- <i>You really don't. I just wanted to kiss you.</i>

915
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:35,298
I forgive you. I forgive you, darling.

916
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:11,269
<i>Listen. Listen. My name is Harry Caul.</i>

917
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,315
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

918
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,777
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

919
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:24,699
<i>I... I know you don't know who I am,
but I know you.</i>

920
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,745
<i>There isn't much to say about myself. I...</i>

921
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:42,133
Sick when I was a boy.

922
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,596
<i>I was very sick when I was a boy.</i>

923
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,517
<i>I was paralyzed in my left arm
and my left leg.</i>

924
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,352
<i>I couldn't walk for six months.</i>

925
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,148
<i>One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.</i>

926
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,151
<i>My mother...</i>

927
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:06,533
<i>My mother used to lower me into a hot bath.
It was therapy.</i>

928
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,537
<i>One time the doorbell rang
and she went down to answer it.</i>

929
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,080
<i>I started sliding down.</i>

930
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,542
<i>I could feel the water.
It started coming up to my chin, to my nose.</i>

931
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:18,002
<i>And when I woke up,</i>

932
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:22,757
<i>my body was all greasy
from the holy oil she put on my body.</i>

933
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,969
<i>I remember being disappointed I survived.</i>

934
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,053
<i>When I was five,</i>

935
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,223
<i>my father introduced me to a friend of his,</i>

936
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:33,059
<i>and for no reason at all,
I hit him right in the stomach with all my strength.</i>

937
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:34,352
<i>He died a year later.</i>

938
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,440
<i>He'll kill you if he gets a chance.</i>

939
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,238
<i>I'm not afraid of death.</i>

940
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:54,456
<i>I am afraid of murder.</i>

941
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,557
Meredith?

942
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,437
Hey!

943
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,733
Bitch.

944
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,210
<i>Good morning. May I help you?</i>

945
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:08,047
- Yes. Extension 765, please.
- <i>One moment, please.</i>

946
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,550
<i>Director's office.</i>

947
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,386
Yes, I'd like to speak
to the director's assistant, please.

948
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,391
Mr. Stett. Mr. Martin Stett.
Mr. Caul is on the line.

949
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,393
<i>One moment, please.</i>

950
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,857
<i>I'm sorry. That's impossible now.
Can we get back to you?</i>

951
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,110
No, I... I have to talk to him.

952
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,739
- <i>Can we have your name again?</i>
- Caul.

953
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:37,619
- <i>Would you mind spelling that?</i>
- C-A-U-L. Caul.

954
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,662
<i>I'm putting you on hold.</i>

955
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:47,295
- <i>Mr. Caul, we'll get right back to you.
- No. You don't have my telephone number!</i>

956
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:48,713
Hello?

957
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:46,104
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Caul? This is Martin Stett.</i>

958
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,146
How did you get this phone number?

959
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:51,651
<i>We prepare a full dossier on everyone
who comes in contact with the director.</i>

960
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,529
<i>You know that means we've been watching you.</i>

961
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:56,906
<i>We have the tapes.
They're perfectly safe.</i>

962
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,784
<i>The director was very anxious to hear them
as soon as possible.</i>

963
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:04,247
<i>You seemed to be...
I don't know... Disturbed.</i>

964
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:07,250
<i>I couldn't take the chance
that you might destroy our tapes.</i>

965
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:10,586
<i>You understand, don't you, Mr. Caul?</i>

966
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:12,797
<i>Our tapes have nothing to do with you.</i>

967
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:17,218
<i>Why don't you come over now
and bring the photographs?</i>

968
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,386
- Yes...
- <i>The director's here,</i>

969
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,763
<i>and he's prepared to pay you in full.</i>

970
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:47,683
<i>Every time I see one of those old guys,
I always think the same thing.</i>

971
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,603
<i>What do you think?</i>

972
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:54,524
<i>I always think that he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

973
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,736
<i>Really, I do.</i>

974
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,322
<i>I think he was once somebody's baby boy,</i>

975
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,200
<i>and he had a mother and a father
who loved him.</i>

976
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,788

978
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,462
<i>Anyway, that's what I always think.</i>

979
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:22,718
<i>I always think how,

01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,303

01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,309
<i>Just because there were no newspapers?</i>

01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:34,856
- <i>Really. Keeps them warm.</i>
- <i>That's terrible.</i>

984
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:39,569
<i>Who started this conversation anyhow?</i>

985
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:43,573
- <i>You did.</i>
- <i>Did not.</i>

986
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:47,076
<i>Yes, you did. You just don't remember it.</i>

987
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:51,539
<i>Oh, Mark, it's all right. We can talk.</i>

988
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:56,168
<i>I can't stand it.
I can't stand it anymore.</i>

989
01:26:56,253 --> 01:27:01,507
- <i>You're going to make me cry.</i>
- <i>I know, honey, I know. Me, too.</i>

990
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:04,677
- <i>No, don't.</i>
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

991
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:09,599
- You want to hear that again?
- You want it to be true!

992
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:14,020
No, I don't. I just want you to know
whatever you need to know.

993
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:15,104
That's all.

994
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:18,316
Your money's on the table.

995
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:22,194
<i>Do you think we can do this?</i>

996
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,365
<i>I'm tired of drinking anyhow.</i>

997
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,870
<i>I'm tired of mostly everything.</i>

998
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,830
- <i>Tired of me?</i>
- <i>Tired of you,</i>

999
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,124
<i>but not today.</i>

1000
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:40,087
<i>Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.</i>

1001
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,800
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1002
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,058
<i>Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1003
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,809
<i>3:00.</i>

1004
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,062
<i>Room 773.</i>

1005
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,940
<i>Look, Mark. Do you see him?</i>

1006
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,400
<i>The man with the hearing aid like Charles?</i>

1007

- <i>No. Where?</i>
- <i>Right there, with the shopping bag.</i>

1008
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,573
Please count your money outside.

1009
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:12,328
<i>He's been following us all around,
and he's following us close.</i>

1010
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,998
<i>It's nothing. Don't worry about it.</i>

1011
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:35,685
<i>God, it will be so good
to be finished with all this.</i>

1012
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,063
<i>I love you.</i>

1013
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,486
These are the pictures you asked for.

1014
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,571
<i>We're spending too much time together here.</i>

1015
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,615
<i>No. Let's stay just a little longer.</i>

1016
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,867
What will you do to her?

1017
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,912
<i>...kill us if he got the chance.</i>

1018
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,584
<i>I think he's been recording my telephone.</i>

1019
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,131
<i>Listen, I'd better get back. It's almost 2:00.</i>

1020
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:08,259
<i>No, please, don't go back there.
Not just yet.</i>

1021
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:13,723
<i>All right. All right, honey. I won't.</i>

1022
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,729
Fifteen thousand bucks.

1023
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:22,189
That's not bad for a day's work,
is it, Mr. Caul?

1024
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,943
What'll he do with them?

1025
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:29,405
We'll see.

1026
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:42,793
<i>He'd kill us if he got the chance.</i>

1027
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:57,433
<i>Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.</i>

1028
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,979
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1029
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,484
<i>Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1030
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,279
<i>3:00.</i>

1031
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,114
<i>Room 773.</i>

1032
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:19,413
I wonder if you could give me Room 773.

1033
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:21,540
773?

1034
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:24,293
That is occupied, sir.

1035
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:30,633
The rooms are all basically the same, however.

1036
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,635
Well...

1037
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:40,059
Do you have a room
that would be adjoining, close by?

1038
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:43,979
- Adjoining, just... Yes, I do.
- You do.

1039
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,233
I'm tired of this lying, all right?
I'm tired of lying!

1040
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:08,369
<i>Oh, Mark, it's all right. We can talk.</i>

1041
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:13,582
<i>I can't stand it.
I can't stand it anymore.</i>

1042
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:17,920
- <i>You're going to make me cry.</i>
- <i>I know, honey, I know. Me, too.</i>

1043
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:19,338
<i>No, don't.</i>

1044
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,590
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1045
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:25,401
No idea! This has all been a lie!
Don't you understand that?

1046
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:30,766
<i>I love you.</i>

1047
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,165
<i>The answer is, "No."</i>

1048
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,916
<i>At the end of the briefing last night,
it was stated</i>

1049
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:41,253
<i>that Nixon would not deliver
the State of the Union message in person...</i>

1050
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:42,754
<i>Why not?</i>

1051
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:55,934
- <i>Watch out for the bumps!</i>
- <i>Will you cut that out?</i>

1052
01:36:56,019 --> 01:37:00,272
<i>How can you yell at me like that?
And in my condition.</i>

1053
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:03,108
<i>You're not fit to be the father of my child.</i>

1054
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:04,776
<i>Oh, what is this?</i>

1055
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:08,447
- <i>I'm just trying to act like Wilma.</i>
- <i>Well, you're overdoing it.</i>

1056
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:14,786
<i>All right. Pull over.</i>

1057
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,290
<i>What's the big rush?</i>

1058
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:21,210
<i>I'm taking my wife to the hospital.
She's having a baby.</i>

1059
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:25,172
<i>I got to hand it to you, buddy.
You sure got intestinal fortitude.</i>

1060
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:28,884
<i>You better sit down, Fred.
You're wearing a groove in the floor.</i>

1061
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:32,596
<i>Look at Wilma out there.</i>

1062
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:36,225
<i>How can she be so calm
when she knows what I'm going through?</i>

1063
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:39,186
- <i>How are you, Fred?</i>
- <i>How do you think I am?</i>

1064
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,396
<i>This waiting, waiting, waiting... It's tough!

1065
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:44,900
<i>Betty, you go back out there
and tell Wilma if she doesn't...</i>

1066
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:08,079
- Wait. Richard!
- I want to see the director.

1067
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:12,751
He's not in today.
I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.

1068
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,788
Let's clear an aisle
and let these people through,

1069
01:44:13,873 --> 01:44:15,707
- and we can move on upstairs.
- Come on, clear the way here.

1070
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:17,042
We'll answer your questions upstairs.

1071
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:20,879
Just let these people through.
Let these people through.

1072
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:23,882
- Just one question.
- No, please.

1073
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:26,301
Do you suspect any foul play
in the accident?

1074
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:27,385
Please!

1075
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,220
What about your corporate control?

1076
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:31,097
Will your stock now give you
a controlling interest...

1077
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:32,557
What kind of insurance do you have?

1078
01:44:32,642 --> 01:44:33,725
What's going to happen to the company?

1079
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:34,809
That's an unfair question.

1080
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:36,561
- Did you have...
- Did your husband...

1081
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:41,441
<i>What do you think?</i>

1082
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,361
<i>I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.</i>

1083
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:46,863
<i>He's already got everything.</i>

1084
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:50,158
<i>He doesn't need anything anymore.</i>

1085
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,164
Do you feel now that there's an enemy
within the company?

1086
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,419
<i>He's not hurting anyone.</i>

1087
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:02,754
<i>Neither are we.</i>

1088
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:05,340
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1089
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:07,050
Did your husband have a history
of drunk driving?

1090
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:08,885
No comments, no more...

1091
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:11,638
Did your husband have a history of drunk,
reckless driving?

1092
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:16,184
<i>I can't stand it.
I can't stand it anymore.</i>

1093
01:45:19,905 --> 01:45:20,851
Take it!

1094
01:45:21,006 --> 01:45:21,957
<i>Take it!</i>

1095
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:30,573
<i>Do you think we can do this?</i>

1096
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,077
<i>Later in the week. Sunday, maybe.</i>

1097
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:37,330
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1098
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:39,916
<i>Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1099
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,669
<i>3:00.</i>

1100
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,254
<i>Room 773.</i>

1101
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,719
<i>He'd kill us if he got the chance.</i>

1102
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:25,503
Hello.

1103
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:28,715
Hello?

1104
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:23,603
Hello.

1105
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,073
- Hello?
- <i>We know that you know, Mr. Caul.</i>

1106
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:38,159
<i>For your own sake,
don't get involved any further.</i>

1107
01:47:38,244 --> 01:47:40,411
<i>We'll be listening to you.</i>
