and thus a need for a creator.

890
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,016
(CHUCKLES) My mistake.

891
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,152
No, mine.

892
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,899
Stephen is looking
for a single theory

893
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,531
that explains all the
forces in the universe.

894
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,575
Therefore, God must die.

895
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,157
Oh, uh, why must God die?
I don't see.

896
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,786
The two great pillars
of physics

897
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,463
are quantum theory,

898
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,876
the laws that govern
the very small particles,
electrons and so on,

899
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,883
and general relativity.

900
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,680
Ah, yes, Einstein.

901
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,265
Einstein's theory,
the laws that govern

902
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,138
the very large planets
and such.

903
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,312
But quantum and relativity...

904
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,389
Don't tell me.
They're different?

905
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,559
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

906
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:24,114
If the world were all
potatoes, then, easy.

907
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,908
You could trace
a precise beginning

908
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,735
as Stephen once did.

909
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,078
A moment of creation.

910
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,540
Hallelujah. God lives.

911
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,763
If you incorporate peas
into the menu,

912
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,415
well, then it all
goes a little...

913
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,959
Tits up.
Oh. (CHUCKLING)

914
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,133
Yes. Haywire.

915
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,427
It just all becomes
a godless mess.
Oh, dear.

916
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,088
(CHUCKLING)
Einstein hated peas.

917
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,511
Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."

918
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,435
STEPHEN: Seems
he not only plays dice,

919
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:02,940
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

920
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,656
God is back on
the endangered species list.
(JONATHAN CHUCKLING)

921
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:10,031
Well, I expect he'll cope.

922
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,830
And physics
is back in business.

923
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,077
JANE: Yes.

924
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,002
<i>Physics is</i> back <i>in business.</i>

925
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,553
I was, uh, married,
actually.

926
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,560
Um... But, sadly,
she passed.

927
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,515
Almost a year ago now.

928
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,941
(EXHALING)

929
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,815
it was, uh, leukemia.

930
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,066
Um, she fought it
and I nursed her.

931
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,452
But, uh, in the end...

932
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,155
Um...
(SIGHING)

933
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,751
I do get quite lonely.

934
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,081
The, uh, (INHALING DEEPLY)
tyranny of the empty room

935
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,507
and all that.

936
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,554
But music is my salvation.
Teaching and playing.

937
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,633
Not really as a career,
but I'm not very ambitious.

938
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,434
Though that's not...

939
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,054
(SIGHING)

940
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,813
Is that a sin?
I don't know.

941
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,231
Wrong man to ask.

942
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,992
Thank you so much
for having me.

943
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,824
Thank you for coming.
It was really, really wonderful.

944
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,294
If there's anything
I can do to be of service,

945
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,416
um, to you,

946
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,839
to the family,
I mean, I would

947
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,632
consider it a privilege.

948
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,300
I have no children
or commitments, so...

949
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,550
I only mean that
if I could be of help,

950
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,059
I believe I might
find a purpose that would

951
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,809
help alleviate my own,
um, situation. (CHUCKLES)

952
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,058
Good night.

953
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,314
Night.

954
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,648
I understand

955
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,354
if you need help.

956
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:59,120
If someone is prepared
to offer it,

957
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,539
I won't object.

958

Yeah, it's very bracing.

961
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,365

Come on. Ready?

962
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,075
Yeah.
(GRUNTING) All right.

going to put the kettle on.

Just gone 7:45.

(CHUCKLES) Um, could you all
leave your copies?
Goodbye.

There's something
I need to tell you.

01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,462
What?

Well, that's really wonderful.

I've always been supportive
of your choice not
to have home help,

990
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,917
but we need to find
a permanent solution.

991
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,795
This, uh, situation
cannot continue.

992
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:26,926
You need to have a proper
live-in nurse immediately.

01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,090
We have help.

01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,227
Look, you know
what I'm talking about.

995

We can't afford
a live-in nurse.

to find a way

01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,727
for your family's sake.

not for rock concerts.

Stephen, this isn't funny.

1001
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,367

to know, Jane.

Know what?

Timothy is.

1007

Stephen's or Jonathan's.

That's what
you think of me.

1009

There's no way that Timothy
could have any other father
than Stephen.

None.

So, what does it matter?

It's difficult for me because
I'm just trying to help.

I know you're trying to help,
and your help is valued.

right now is...
I think maybe if (STAMMERING)

to manage, Stephen.

Bring Jonathan.

be willing.

Yes?

...as soon as you land.
No. Of course.

1053
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:54,631
And you'll call me
when you get to the hotel?
I will.

01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,254
Yes? Promise? Good.
Yes.

Stephen.
