1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,540
I accept this honor for our lost ones,

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,266
whose deaths pave our path.

3
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,380
And for the 20 million
Negro men and women

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,268
motivated by dignity
and a disdain for hopelessness.

5
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,220
This isn't right.

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,501
Corrie.

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,020
This ain't right.

8
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,426
What's that?

9
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,586
This necktie. It's not right.

10
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,740
Well, it's not a necktie, dear.
It's an ascot.

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,990
Yes, but generally the same principles
should apply, shouldn't they?

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,624
It's not right.

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,789
It's not right, or you don't like it?

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,900
I don't like how this looks.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,540
Looks distinguished and debonair to me.

16
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,100
You know what I mean.

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,180
Like we're living high on the hog.

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,226
Dressed like this
while folks back home are...

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,143
It's not right.

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,340
Wait till the brothers back home
see me like this.

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,780
They'll have a good laugh.

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,140
Let them laugh.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,390
It's not a crime to be away
for a few days, Martin.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,146
It's nice being away, huh?

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,345
Yeah. It really is.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,941
Look here.

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,148
I'm gonna be a pastor somewhere small.

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,265
College town.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,070
Lead a little church. Teach a class.

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,988
Maybe the occasional
speaking engagement.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,380
And I'll pay all the bills for us,

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,789
especially the mortgage
for our very own house.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,790
Perfect.

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,824
You look handsome.

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,900
Through it all,

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,231
Martin Luther King has
spoken of his dream.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,380
One which we

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,869
and many other people
around the world share.

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,420
To this undeterred hero for justice,

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,060
the Nobel Committee of Oslo, Norway,

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,710
awards our 1964 Peace Prize.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,780
I accept this honor for our lost ones,

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,020
whose deaths pave our path.

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,260
I accept this honor for the more than
20 million American Negroes

45
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,380
who are motivated by dignity.

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,060
Together we believe that
what the illusion

47
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,581
of supremacy has destroyed,

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,060
the truth of equality can nourish.

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,540
I promise you.
It ain't nothing to be scared of.

50
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,700
It's quick. And the pastor
is right there next to you.

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,260
Yeah, but the biggest thing
is getting your hair wet up.

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,740
I got my hair pressed that same morning

53
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,900
and it was wasted
as soon as I hit the water.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,023
I should have worn a swim cap
like Mama said.

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,220
See, I asked my mama

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,780
could she make my hair like
Coretta Scott King had hers

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,420
at the Washington March.

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,140
But she said that was too grown.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,580
Oh, I love her hair.

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,340
I heard she don't even put rollers in it.
It's just like that.

61
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,740
But I studied it. I know how she do it.

62
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,102
See, she parts in the middle and then...

63
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,781
Annie Lee Cooper!

64
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,787
Get on up now. I ain't got all day.

65
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,741
You work for Mr. Dunn
down at the rest home, ain't that right?

66
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,626
Yes.

67
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,820
Wonder what old Dunn'll say
when I tell him

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,780
one of his gals is down here
stirring a fuss.

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,349
I ain't stirring no fuss.
I'm just here trying to register to vote.

70
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,780
It's all right this time.

71
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,869
It's right when I say it's right.

72
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,701
Recite the Constitution's preamble.
Know what a preamble is?

73
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,950
"We the people of the United States,

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,751
"in order to form a more perfect union,

75
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,106
"establish justice,

76
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,585
"ensure domestic tranquility,

77
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,340
"provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare..."

78
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,384
How many county judges in Alabama?

79
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,630
Sixty-seven.

80
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,510
Name them.

81
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,700
Aren't we done?
Are we not done with this?

82
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,020
- Will this ever end?
- I don't know, Mr. President.

83
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,140
A comprehensive plan
is already in place.

84
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,860
The act was only passed six months ago.

85
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,900
So hammer home that
impatience only hurts the overall cause.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,380
We're... We're getting there.
Just... Just keep reiterating the plan.

87
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,740
No, he doesn't want reiteration.

88
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,420
He wants something so he can say,
"Look, I told you I had a dream

89
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,860
"and it's all coming goddamn true,
whether you like it or not!"

90
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,580
That's what he wants.

91
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,980
What he needs to do
is get on board with what we're doing

92
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,342
instead of the other way around.
For once!

93
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,740
Mr. President, Dr. King.

94
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,420
Mr. President.

95
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,270
Dr. King.

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,860
Well, I'll tell you.
I'm a tall son-of-a-bitch,

97
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,260
but this close to the new Nobel laureate

98
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,740
and with all those other trinkets
you've been collecting lately,

99
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,749
I feel tits-high to a puppy dog.

100
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,830
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

101
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,700
Mr. White.

102
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,060
- Dr. King.
- All right.

103
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,580
I'll tell you, ending segregation,

104
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,102
proudest moment of my life
when I signed that '64 Act.

105
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,700
Proudest moment of my life, I tell you.

106
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,620
Now civil rights is a priority

107
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,740
- of this administration as you know.
- Thank you.

108
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,060
We're gonna face the challenge,

109
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,460
or this country is
storing up a heap of trouble for itself.

110
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,580
Now, seeing as I can't convince you to
work with my administration

111
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,262
in an official capacity
inside the White House,

112
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,620
I feel damn fortunate

113
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,380
to have someone as statesmanlike as you

114
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,460
leading the movement.

115
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,420
And I want you to go on leading it.
No one else.

116
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,669
Not one of these
militant Malcolm X types.

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,747
So... I wanna help. Tell me how.

118
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,460
Well, Mr. President,

119
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,420
I'm here to speak
specifically about the denial

120
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,988
of a basic American right
for the Negro citizen.

121
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,349
The right to vote.

122
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,500
Well... Technically...

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,460
Technically, we already have it.
Yes, Mr. President.

124
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,660
But, we both know in the South

125
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,460
black voters are kept off the rolls
and out of the voting booths

126
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,188
by systematic intimidation
and fear, Mr. President.

127
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,464
Now, you asked how you can help.

128
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,580
We want Federal legislation

129
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,500
granting Negroes the right
to vote unencumbered.

130
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,020
And we want Federal protocol eliminating

131
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,660
the decades-long dismissal

132
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,140
and illegal denial
of blacks seeking to vote.

133
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,140
And we want
robust enforcement of that protocol.

134
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,020
Well... That's fine.

135
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,900
But... Most of the South
is still not desegregating.

136
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,706
Let's not start another battle
when we haven't even won the first.

137
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,580
And you know what
the next battle should be?

138
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,260
The eradication of poverty.

139
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,783
I'm calling it "The War on Poverty."

140
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,660
It's a matter of political priorities.

141
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,910
Poverty is going to be my focus at home
and I want you to help me with this.

142
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,820
We can make big changes in these things

143
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,540
for people of all colors.

144
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,940
And I know that matters to you,
doesn't it?

145
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,381
This voting thing
is just gonna have to wait.

146
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,380
It...

147
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,580
It can't wait, Mr. President.

148
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,700
Well, why not?

149
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,900
Because there have been thousands

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,380
of racially motivated murders
in the South,

151
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,900
including those four girls.

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,060
Well, I know that...

153
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,740
And you know the astounding fact

154
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,700
that not one of these criminals
who murder us when and why they want

155
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,420
has ever been convicted.

156
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,180
Yeah, I know we have a lot
of work to do down there.

157
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,020
Not one conviction because they
are protected by white officials

158
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,620
chosen by an all-white electorate.

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,540
And on the rare occasions
that they face trial,

160
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,620
they are freed by all-white juries.

161
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,780
All-white because
you can't serve on a jury

162
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,460
unless you are registered to vote.

163
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,180
Well, Dr. King, you've certainly given me
something to think about.

164
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,940
But this administration is going to
set this aside for a while.

165
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,507
Just for a while, you understand.

166
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,787
Yes, Mr. President, I... I understand.

167
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,264
Selma it is.

168
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,824
Big speech lined up
for these folks tonight, Doc?

169
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,466
We need to see what's what first,
Big Fellow.

170
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,820
We're just here to test the waters.

171
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,388
Oh, my Lord.
What you got us into, woman?

172
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,660
We've got 128 miles
to come to our senses, gentlemen.

173
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,980
Hush.

174
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,780
This here is the place we need to be.

175
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,631
This right here
is the next great battle.

176
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,468
I can only imagine.

177
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,789
Decent-looking place to die though.

178
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,981
Ms. Nash.

179
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,460
Mr. Bevel.

180
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,949
Doc? This here is it. Selma's the place.

181
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,060
A lot of groundwork has already
been laid by the people here.

182
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,261
And they ready.

183
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,741
- Sister Boynton.
- Mr. Orange.

184
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,271
Good afternoon.

185
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,948
Dr. King?

186
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,941
May I introduce myself?

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,269
Yeah, of course.

188
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,507
Hey!

189
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,471
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

190
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,586
This way, Dr. King.

191
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,700
That white boy can hit.

192
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,100
This place is perfect.

193
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,782
What's the FBI's current information
on Martin Luther King?

194
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,620
I heard he was assaulted in Selma.

195
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,620
My information can be
summed up in a few words.

196
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,820
King is a political
and moral degenerate.

197
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,620
Well, you say that, J. Edgar.
I have to take it seriously.

198
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,900
But if he's a degenerate,
what I do know is,

199
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,140
he's a non-violent degenerate.

200
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,140
And I want him to go on leading
the civil rights movement,

201
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,220
not one of these bloodthirsty militants.

202
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,345
What I need to know right now is
what's he about to do next?

203
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,671
Mr. President,

204
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,140
you know we can shut men with power down

205
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,265
permanently and unequivocally.

206
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,829
I'm very aware of that, Mr. Director.

207
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,951
Well, if you prefer
a different approach,

208
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,544
we can go with the wife.

209
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,710
We know there's tension
in the home already.

210
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,907
We can weaken the dynamic.

211
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,464
Dismantle the family.

212
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,780
Hello.

213
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,948
You ain't got long.

214
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,589
When the hearts of those Pickaninnies
of yours stop beating...

215
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,429
Same thing?

216
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,660
When are you all heading out?

217
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,820
We're heading back to Selma at 5:00 a.m.

218
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,229
It turned out to be
an ideal staging ground.

219
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,308
There's a full couple of weeks planned.

220
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,270
Quite a bit to be done.

221
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,985
I see.

222
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,670
That highway is nice now.
Get you there in a couple of hours.

223
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,231
Good people in those parts though.

224
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,706
Well...

225
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,065
I'm worried about the ones
who ain't so good.

226
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,027
This local Sheriff Jim Clark
is supposed to be bad business.

227
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,662
Won't go down without a fight, they say.

228
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,711
And since we don't fight...

229
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,705
Well...

230
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,351
As good a place to die as any, I guess.

231
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,748
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

232
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,462
It just takes the edge off.

233
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,540
You and your friends
can joke about that.

234
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,868
I don't joke about that.

235
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,664
You're right. I'm sorry.

236
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,260
I'll put these things away
in your bag now.

237
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,509
I didn't realize
you were leaving so early.

238
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,940
Hello?

239
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,266
Halie?

240
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,710
Martin.

241
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,186
I need to hear the Lord's voice.

242
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,146
Surely, Martin. Surely.

243
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,789
Precious Lord

244
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,303
Take my hand

245
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,345
Lead me home

246
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,861
Let me stand

247
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,189
I am tired

248
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,542
I am weak

249
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,663
I am worn

250
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,425
Through the storm

251
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,029
Through the night

252
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,784
Lord, lead me on

253
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,621
To the light

254
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,980
- Hey!
- Hey!

255
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,670
- Sully.
- Look at you.

256
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,020
- Morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Doctor.

257
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,700
- Drive all right?
- Good and long.

258
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,700
Good news is Richie Jean is in there.

259
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,301
Oh, she's ready for you.

260
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,420
Negro, that's all you had to say.

261
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,300
Uncle Marty!

262
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,741
There she is! There's our girl!

263
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,861
Hey, Richie Jean!

264
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,260
- Looking like her mom.
- You go play.

265
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,986
- Hey!
- Hey, Ralphy.

266
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,580
- How you doing?
- Hey!

267
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,700
Good to see you, sweetheart.

268
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,390
Hey, come over here.

269
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,460
Oh, Lord, it's good to see this!

270
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,620
Okay, now, I've got the grits
on the stove.

271
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,700
How many we expecting today?

272
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,020
Well, now, Sister Jackson.

273
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,700
You know about our group,
the SCLC, right?

274
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,740
The Southern Christian
Leadership Conference?

275
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,260
A few of our top SCLC leaders
are with us this time

276
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,907
since we're going to be here
a little longer than expected.

277
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,860
Now, this here's Reverend C.T. Vivian.

278
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,660
He coordinates all the SCLC branches.

279
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,420
Welcome. Nice to meet you.
Welcome, welcome.

280
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,340
This is Reverend James Bevel.

281
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,460
- How you doing, ma'am?
- I'm well. Thank you.

282
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,100
This here is James Orange.

283
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,580
Oh, this is a big one.

284
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,140
I don't know if I've got enough
to feed you.

285
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,700
Well, let's find out. How about that?

286
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,820
Hey!

287
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,020
Now, you got two of them named James.

288
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,460
- Oh, you can call me Jim, Sister.
- And Orange is fine with me, ma'am.

289
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,780
Or Big Fellow!

290
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,820
All right. Well, this is fine with me.

291
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,980
Mrs. Jackson. Hosea Williams.

292
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,300
Or Castro!

293
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,100
Oh, yeah, that's a long story.

294
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,180
Those grits, they need some stirring.
Mind?

295
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,905
You put your foot in it now.

296
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,149
Ain't you supposed to be on a diet?

297
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,581
Somebody call Juanita.

298
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,820
- There's a phone!
- Hey, get off that phone.

299
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,020
Juanita?

300
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,461
Don't do it, Doc. Don't do it...

301
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,268
Turning in, Doc. You okay?

302
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,671
Yes, sir. Good night to you.

303
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,383
I wanted to tell you that
the students are in town.

304
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,220
Local students?

305
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,184
Oh, no.

306
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,181
The Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee.

307
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,861
Okay. Our young friends at SNCC.

308
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,660
Good to know.

309
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,022
You the one told them to organize.

310
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,621
Took it to heart.

311
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,500
Don't be surprised
if they don't give us grief tomorrow.

312
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,385
Town folk may be happy to see us.
But SNCC?

313
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,226
They feel we're in their territory.

314
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,430
They're young and full of spirit.

315
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,511
Not a bad thing.

316
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,269
It'll sort out.

317
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,470
Good night.

318
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,111
Good night.

319
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,020
"Boycotting the buses in Montgomery.

320
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,427
"Segregation in Birmingham."

321
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,061
Boycotting the buses in Montgomery.

322
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,750
Segregation in Birmingham.

323
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,061
Now? Voting in Selma.

324
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,229
One struggle ends just to go
right to the next and the next.

325
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,224
If you think of it that way,
it's a hard road.

326
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,380
But I don't think of it that way.

327
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,220
I think of these efforts as one effort.

328
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,230
And that one effort is for our life.

329
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,708
Our life as a community.
Our life as a nation.

330
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,263
For our lives.

331
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,031
We can do this.

332
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,305
We must do this!

333
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,020
We see children

334
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,860
become victims of one
of the most vicious crimes

335
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,543
ever perpetrated against humanity
within the walls of their own church!

336
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,380
They are sainted now.

337
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,780
They are the sainted ones
in this quest for freedom.

338
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,540
And they speak to us still.

339
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,904
They say to us, to all of us,
all colors and creeds,

340
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,870
that we must do this.

341
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,180
They say to us that it is unacceptable

342
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,620
for more than 50% of Selma to be Negro

343
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,220
and yet less than 2% of Negroes here
being able to vote

344
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,424
and determine their own destiny
as human beings.

345
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,500
They say to us that
the local white leadership

346
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,980
use their power to
keep us away from the ballot box

347
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,864
and keep us voiceless.

348
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,308
As long as I am unable to exercise
my constitutional right to vote,

349
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,220
I do not have command of my own life.

350
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,820
I cannot determine my own destiny
for it is determined for me

351
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,263
by people who would rather
see me suffer than succeed.

352
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,300
Those that have gone before us say,
"No more!"

353
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,620
No more! No more!

354
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,260
No more!

355
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,140
That means protest, that means march,

356
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,460
that means disturb the peace,
that means jail,

357
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,061
that means risk! And that is hard!

358
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,060
We will not wait any longer.

359
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,140
Give us the vote!

360
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,910
That's right! No more!

361
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,340
We're not asking. We're demanding.

362
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,620
Give us the vote!

363
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,946
Give us the vote!

364
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,460
Dr. King.
Roy Reed of The New York Times.

365
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,540
Yes. Hello to you. How are you?

366
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
I'm well, sir. Thank you for asking.

367
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,900
Dr. King, are you truly non-violent
if you are provoking violence, sir?

368
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,980
We are here,
using our very bodies in protest

369
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,900
- to say to those who deny us...
- Dr. King. Dr. King.

370
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,980
Pleasure, sir.

371
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,820
...that we will no longer let them
use their billy clubs

372
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,740
in dark corners and halls of power.

373
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,580
We make them do it
in the glaring light of day, Mr. Reed.

374
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,620
Is SNCC standing with us
on this or not, gentlemen?

375
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,060
You want us to bring our people in,
but you're not giving anything in return.

376
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,580
Now we are asking
for some kind of commitment here.

377
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,620
Respectfully speaking, of course,

378
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,700
we've been handling
the voter registration

379
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,540
in this town now for two years.

380
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,107
Well, you haven't gotten very far,
have you?

381
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,780
Well, maybe not, Reverend.
But we're still here.

382
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,860
Meaning what?

383
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,460
This time next month, you won't be!

384
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,700
- That's insanity!
- Just like you left Albany.

385
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,220
Those people are pathetic
down there now.

386
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,460
Like they daddy left home!

387
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,660
What we're trying
to explain is that in Albany you all...

388
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,580
You know what I think?
Maybe we should just leave Selma...

389
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,740
Now! Leave it to these two.

390
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,060
Come back in another two years
and see how much further you got!

391
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,069
- Sounds just fine to me.
- That's enough.

392
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,181
Enough of this now.

393
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,871
I haven't the time for this.
None of us got the time for this.

394
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,025
John.

395
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,071
James.

396
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,700
The way our organization works
is straightforward.

397
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,110
We negotiate. We demonstrate. We resist.

398
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,620
And on our best days, our adversary
helps the matter by making a mistake.

399
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,303
Now, we were in Albany for nine months
and we made a lot of mistakes.

400
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,466
But their sheriff, Laurie Pritchett,

401
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,620
he never made a mistake.

402
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,060
Kept his cool,
kept arresting us in a humane way,

403
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,580
carried people to
the jail-wagons on stretchers.

404
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,862
Day in, day out.

405
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,140
There was no drama.

406
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,865
You mean there was no cameras.

407
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,141
Exactly.

408
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,340
Now I know, we all understand,
that you young people

409
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,220
believe in working
in the community long-term.

410
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,266
Doing the good work
to raise black consciousness.

411
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,940
It's good grassroots work.

412
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,350
I can't tell you
how much we admire that.

413
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,340
But what we do

414
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,340
is negotiate,

415
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,980
demonstrate,

416
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,180
resist.

417
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,300
And a big part of that

418
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,500
is raising white consciousness.

419
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,900
And in particular the consciousness

420
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,740
of whichever white man
happens to be sitting

421
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,941
in the Oval Office.

422
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,143
Right now, Johnson has other fish to fry
and he'll ignore us if he can.

423
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,780
The only way to stop him doing that

424
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,711
is by being on the front page
of the national press every morning

425
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,020
and by being on the TV news every night.

426
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,268
And that requires

427
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,261
drama.

428
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,901
Now...

429
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,666
John.

430
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,100
James.

431
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,029
Answer me one question.

432
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,900
I've been told the sheriff in this town
isn't like Laurie Pritchett in Albany.

433
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,389
He's a big ignorant bully
like Bull Connor in Birmingham.

434
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,420
Well, you tell me. You know Selma.

435
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,066
You know Sheriff Jim Clark.

436
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,668
Is he Laurie Pritchett?
Or is he Bull Connor?

437
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,381
He's Bull Connor.

438
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,983
- Bingo!
- Good.

439
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,631
That's good.

440
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,861
But it gets better.

441
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,260
See, Clark doesn't control the streets
like Connor did in Birmingham.

442
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,580
Clark's the County Sheriff,

443
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,780
and all he controls in Selma
is the County Courthouse.

444
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,300
So relatively speaking,

445
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,267
we have clear avenues of approach
to a defined battle zone.

446
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,180
In the courthouse
sits the heart of the matter,

447
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,580
the voter registration office.

448
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,500
Now this is an exceptional circumstance.

449
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,660
See, in Albany, there were
no clearly defined battle zones.

450
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,020
The issue was segregation,
and segregation was everywhere.

451
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,226
In Selma, we can concentrate
our actions on one building.

452
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,067
A citadel, defended by fanatics.

453
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,585
The Selma Courthouse.

454
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,504
A perfect stage.

455
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,421
Y'all deliberately
causing an obstruction!

456
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,860
You don't disperse,
you're gonna be arrested.

457
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,060
I promise you!

458
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,820
Sheriff Clark,

459
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,740
we're trying to gain access
to the registration office.

460
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,420
Which is our legal right.

461
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,060
There's too many of you.
And you know damn well there is!

462
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,340
Now, y'all just gonna have
to wait at the rear!

463
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,940
No, Sheriff Clark.

464
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,500
We're going in the front
and we're gonna wait right here.

465
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,022
Segregation is now illegal
in this country, sir.

466
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,540
Get out, nigger.

467
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,660
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

468
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,941
Kneel down, Daddy.

469
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,226
Come on.

470
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,423
Keep this sidewalk clear. Clear a path!

471
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,140
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

472
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,620
Get the hell out of the way!

473
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,629
Keep the sidewalk clear!

474
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,060
I said keep it clear!

475
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,660
Okay. We about to sit him down.
He can't sit.

476
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,820
Then he needs to learn.

477
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,620
- He gonna sit.
- Sit down, God damn it!

478
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,584
Hey, hey! Pa? Pa?

479
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,391
Daddy.

480
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,580
I just told you he can't sit.

481
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,145
What do we got here?

482
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,460
What's going on here, boy?
What we got here? What we got here?

483
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,380
- Jimmie! Sit down!
- No, Mama, I'm sick of this.

484
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,580
- Jimmie!
- Don't do it.

485
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,340
- Do you have a problem, boy?
- I'm sick of this! I just told you...

486
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,820
What'd you think, boy? What'd you think?

487
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,670
What the fuck are you thinking?

488
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,500
Get that nigger woman!

489
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,906
Kill that nigger bitch!

490
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,786
Get your hands off of me!

491
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,940
We will not tolerate
a bunch of nigra agitators

492
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,700
attempting to orchestrate
a disturbance in this state.

493
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,709
Not as long as I'm governor.

494
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,340
Now, I stand here today

495
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,340
in the cradle of the Confederacy

496
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,020
to remind its people
of our Founding Fathers'

497
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,020
goals of duty.

498
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,340
Goals long since forgotten
by progressives and liberals

499
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,940
in favor of what they call
a changing world.

500
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,860
They seek to make us one mongrel unit.

501
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,020
Instead of allowing each race to flourish
from its separate racial station

502
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,540
as has been the standard
for generations now.

503
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,700
Good morning, Mr. President.

504
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,820
Their changing world

505
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,988
is sickening the balance
of the Southland.

506
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,140
Now...

507
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,660
I pledged to stand up
for Alabama when I campaigned

508
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,700
and the people elected me
on that pledge,

509
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,585
and that is exactly what I intend to do.

510
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,467
Johnson'll flinch.

511
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,028
I'm tired, Ralphy.

512
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,829
Tiring of this.

513
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,260
Eyes on the prize, Martin.

514
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,260
Yeah, but what is the prize, friend?

515
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,740
We fight to have a seat
at whatever table we want.

516
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,940
How does it help a black man
to be able to eat at a lunch counter

517
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,620
if he doesn't earn enough
to buy the burger?

518
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,142
Or worse yet, can't even...

519
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,020
Can't even read the menu

520
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,540
'cause there was no Negro school
where he's from.

521
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,660
What is that?

522
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,941
That equality?

523
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,180
Amen.

524
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,428
And what about in our minds?

525
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,826
Equality in the black psyche.
Look at these men.

526
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,300
Beaten and broken down for generations.

527
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,821
Deciding to demand more?

528
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,460
What happens when a man stands up
and says enough is enough?

529
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,340
Look at Medgar.

530
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,460
Murdered the man in his own driveway.

531
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,660
Kids and wife right there
inside the house.

532
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,580
George and Herbert Lee, Lamar Smith.

533
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,863
A man stands up, only to be struck down.

534
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,186
And what happens to the people he led?

535
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,262
What are we doing, Ralphy?

536
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,541
We take it piece by piece.

537
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,710
Like we been doing.

538
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,701
We build the path as we can.

539
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,303
Rock by rock.

540
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,542
This cell is probably bugged.

541
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,745
It probably is.

542
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,065
Oh, Lord.

543
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,821
They're gonna ruin me
so they can ruin this movement.

544
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,620
They are.

545
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,743
"Look at the birds of the air,

546
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,025
"that they do not sow, nor reap,
nor gather into barns,

547
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,742
"and yet your Heavenly Father
doth feed them.

548
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,661
"Are you not worth much more than they?

549
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,060
"And who of you by being worried

550
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,786
"can add a single hour to his life?"

551
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,060
Matthew 6, verse 27.

552
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,625
All right.

553
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,906
Yes, sir.

554
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,820
What? Where did you hear that?

555
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,180
I overheard them talking
about him coming in this evening.

556
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,300
Overheard us?

557
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,460
I'm learning about this just like you.
We didn't do this.

558
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,980
That Negro can't be talking about that

559
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,420
"by any means necessary" madness
with these people.

560
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,940
They about to bust as it is.

561
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,100
He's on his way here, right?

562
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,860
So we gotta figure this out.
Right and fast.

563
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,903
He ain't on his way. He here.

564
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,711
Holy shit.

565
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,826
Are you all right?

566
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,501
I wish I had more time
to prepare is all.

567
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,780
I want to do this kind of thing
whenever possible.

568
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,063
But I don't get to do it enough
to feel entirely comfortable.

569
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,831
I prefer to be prepared.

570
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,060
Yes, I understand that.

571
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,264
I admire you. I do.

572
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,420
Sometimes I wish
I were more out there in the trenches.

573
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,861
You do more than you know, Mrs. King.

574
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,140
I'll tell you what I know to be true.

575
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,020
It helps me in times
when I'm feeling unsure.

576
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,820
If you'd like.

577
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,261
Please do, Mrs. Boynton.

578
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,700
I know that we are descendants
of a mighty people,

579
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,426
who gave civilization to the world.

580
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,340
People who survived
the hulls of slave ships

581
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,300
across vast oceans.

582
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,700
People who innovate and create and love

583
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,189
despite pressures
and tortures unimaginable.

584
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,980
They are in our bloodstream.

585
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,786
Pumping our hearts every second.

586
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,063
They've prepared you.

587
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,060
You are already prepared.

588
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,740
Mrs. King, I mean no disrespect.

589
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,347
I come with great respect
for your husband.

590
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,380
I have no army behind me anymore.

591
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,020
I have myself and the truth.

592
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,500
That is all I stand on today.

593
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,860
You've said disrespectful things
in the past, Minister.

594
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,580
So you'll understand
why there is some alarm here tonight.

595
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,860
I do. I understand that.

596
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,060
Your husband and I,
we do not see exactly eye-to-eye

597
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,340
on how to achieve progress
for the black man.

598
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,180
And yes, I have been piercing
in my critiques of non-violence.

599
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,260
But because we don't agree, Mrs. King,

600
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,500
does not mean that I'm the enemy.

601
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,740
What do you intend to say
to these people then, sir?

602
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,220
A lot of work has been done here,

603
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,422
and I don't intend to
see it undone tonight.

604
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,022
Let's just say,
my eyes see in a new way.

605
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,104
But your local sheriff here?
He doesn't know that.

606
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,901
So allow me to be the alternative
to your husband.

607
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,740
The alternative that scares them so much

608
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,660
they turn to Dr. King in refuge.

609
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,140
Let my being here, Mrs. King,
represent the factions

610
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,900
that will come if they don't
give the good reverend

611
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,740
what he's asking for and soon.

612
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,100
Do you know what he has said
about us in the past, Coretta?

613
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,780
He called us "ignorant Negro preachers."

614
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,980
Called me a modern day Uncle Tom.

615
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,100
Said on national television
that the white man pays me

616
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,260
to keep Negroes defenseless.

617
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,384
The white man pays me!

618
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,420
How could you allow it?

619
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,140
It wasn't like that this time, Martin.
I'm telling you...

620
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,620
He spoke with some of the words
he's used before,

621
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,663
but it wasn't aimed at you.

622
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,671
It was...

623
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,665
It had more to do with helping us.

624
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,620
Not that you need his help.
I'm just telling you how it was.

625
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,460
This movement, our movement,

626
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,780
has been the one
that has moved the needle.

627
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,460
Our movement changes laws
and day-to-day life for our people.

628
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,660
But what has he changed?

629
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,181
Actually changed?

630
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,300
You don't sound like yourself.
You sound tired.

631
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,389
And you sound enamored.

632
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,465
I didn't mean that.

633
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,791
Corrie.

634
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,705
Coretta.

635
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,464
I didn't mean that.

636
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,864
I'm tired.

637
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,870
You're right.

638
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,149
Rest then.

639
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,581
Rest tonight, Martin.

640
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,223
This is not what I want to hear.

641
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,060
How in Christ's sake does
Malcolm X slip into my state,

642
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,900
meet with the wife of the other one,

643
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,940
and give an actual speech
to these nigras

644
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,380
who are already riled up enough?

645
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,740
I mean, how does that happen,
Colonel Lingo?

646
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,380
Governor...

647
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,743
Is every spook militant in existence
gonna pay us a visit?

648
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,940
Do you know what this means?

649
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,746
Johnson is going to get jumpy.

650
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,780
King and X together is sending him
through the cotton-pickin' stratosphere.

651
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,580
And pictures of nigras
getting beat in the street

652
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,860
- doesn't help the matter.
- Governor...

653
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,060
Now I can't make a move
against that backwoods,

654
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,260
white trash Sheriff Clark 'cause
that'll be seen as I'm helping King.

655
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,465
But somebody got to
get Jim Clark under control.

656
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,500
Election year is coming up

657
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,940
and this black voting business
won't abide.

658
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,780
I mean, what's not clear about that?

659
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,020
Look, George, I'm telling you,

660
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,780
if the Lord Jesus and Elvis Presley
come visiting and they said,

661
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,940
"Jim, now, we need you to
treat them niggers nice."

662
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,700
Jim Clark would beat the shit
out of the pair of them,

663
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,981
then throw them in jail.

664
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,540
Jesus H. Christ.

665
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,460
Jim's a good old boy,
he's a friend of mine.

666
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,150
Jim Clark just ain't that scary.

667
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,181
Now he's playing into their hands.

668
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,300
Now...

669
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,980
If you want fear,

670
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,591
you need dominance in Selma.

671
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,100
Hoover picked up some intel
about a night march.

672
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,340
Wasn't announced.

673
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,580
It's some locals outside of King's group.
Unofficial, they called it.

674
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,100
Supposed to happen tomorrow night
once King leaves jail.

675
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,951
Going to some bleeding heart fundraiser
in California.

676
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,785
So...

677
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,623
King's out of town.

678
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,740
Fewer cameras.

679
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,661
And at night.

680
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,340
Find a reason to send us in there.

681
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,980
Let's scare some real sense
into them black bastards.

682
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,540
Y'all move back.

683
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,390
Move back now. Get back.

684
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,710
Go back to your homes now.

685
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,260
Stop! Leave him be!

686
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,507
Mama, come on!

687
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,870
Mama, come on!

688
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,709
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

689
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,020
This way, this way.

690
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,381
Leave him alone.

691
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,226
It's all right.

692
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,060
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

693
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,140
Act like you're...

694
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,501
Act like you're reading your menu. Okay?

695
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,901
It's okay.

696
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,107
Pops...

697
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,220
It's all right, Mama.
It's gonna be cool.

698
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,990
It's okay, it's okay.

699
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,741
Hey! Hey...

700
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,100
No, get off of him! Just get off of him!

701
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,746
Get off of him! No!

702
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,224
No! Get off of him!

703
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,391
Stop it! No, no, no!

704
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,866
Stop it!

705
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,387
Help me.

706
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,460
Help me.

707
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,860
Jimmie.

708
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,940
Jimmie. Jimmie. Jimmie.

709
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,187
Help me.

710
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,905
Sir?

711
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,746
Dr. King.

712
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,150
There are no words to soothe you,
Mr. Lee.

713
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,587
There are no words.

714
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,868
But I can tell you one thing
for certain.

715
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,300
God was the first to cry.

716
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,911
Yes.

717
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,020
He was the first to cry for your boy.

718
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,984
Yes. I believe that.

719
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,589
Is your daughter...

720
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,784
Is Jimmie Lee's mother here, Mr. Lee?

721
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,822
No, she... She couldn't make it.

722
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,111
May I ask your age, sir?

723
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,701
Well, I... I got 82 years.

724
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,820
1883.

725
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,100
Right.

726
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,382
Yeah. Jimmie...

727
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,022
He born in '38.

728
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,060
He a Army man.

729
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,740
I mean, he was... Was an Army man.

730
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,227
In the Army a spell.

731
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,460
He say, "Pa, you gonna vote
before you done."

732
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,503
That's what he said.

733
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,304
He tell me.

734
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,580
- He was a good boy.
- Yes.

735
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,861
Always good.

736
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,624
Always good.

737
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,664
Jimmie gone.

738
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,101
I'm so sorry.

739
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,861
Yeah.

740
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,145
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

741
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,220
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

742
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,980
We know a state trooper

743
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,260
acting under the orders
of George Wallace

744
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,861
pointed the gun and pulled the trigger.

745
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,226
But how many other fingers
were on that trigger?

746
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,701
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

747
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,748
Every white lawman
who abuses the law to terrorize.

748
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,620
Every white politician

749
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,903
who feeds on prejudice and hatred.

750
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,700
Every white preacher
who preaches the Bible

751
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,710
and stays silent
before his white congregation.

752
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,784
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

753
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:13,740
Every Negro man and woman
who stands by without joining this fight

754
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,740
as their brothers and sisters
are humiliated,

755
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,830
brutalized, and ripped from this earth!

756
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,900
When I heard

757
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,468
President Kennedy
had been shot and killed...

758
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,380
And when I heard just yesterday

759
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,260
that Malcolm X,

760
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,580
who stood in this very church
just three weeks ago,

761
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,782
had been shot and killed,

762
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,780
I turned to my wife Coretta

763
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,622
and said the same thing I often say
when one of our leaders is struck down,

764
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,460
"Our lives are not fully lived

765
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,743
"if we're not willing to die
for those we love

766
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,825
"and for what we believe."

767
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,300
But today, Jimmie,

768
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,186
we're doing the living
and you've done the dying, dear brother.

769
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,300
We will not let your sacrifice
pass in vain, dear brother.

770
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,340
We will not let it go!

771
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,620
We will finish what you were after!

772
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,140
We will get what you were denied!

773
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,740
We will vote and we will
put these men out of office!

774
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,820
We will take their power!

775
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,340
We will win
what you were slaughtered for!

776
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,508
Yeah!

777
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,547
We're going back to Washington.

778
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,100
We're going to demand
to see the President.

779
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,380
And I'm gonna tell him

780
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,660
that Jimmie was murdered
by an administration

781
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,660
that spends millions
of dollars every day

782
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,100
to sacrifice life
in the name of liberty in Vietnam,

783
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,140
yet lacks the moral will
and the moral courage

784
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,062
to defend the lives
of its own people here in America!

785
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,543
We will not let it go!

786
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,460
And if he does not act, we will act.
We will act!

787
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,860
We will do it for all of our lost ones.

788
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,260
All of those, like Jimmie Lee Jackson,

789
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,226
who have gone too soon, taken by hate!

790
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,860
Let me hear the top-tier issues

791
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,860
that have to be evident
in the overall legislation we demand.

792
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,100
Let's break it down.

793
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,746
But let's root this discussion
in what we know.

794
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,980
We know Johnson
can't see the full picture.

795
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,820
So, let's paint it for him.

796
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,980
What are the specific hardships
and humiliations

797
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,105
we can address within the larger
context of legislation?

798
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,580
Doc, we gotta start
with banning these laws that

799
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,180
if a Negro tries to register,

800
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,111
I mean, actually musters up the courage
to go in that courthouse,

801
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,780
that their name and address
is published in the paper.

802
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,260
It gives anybody who wants
to do them any harm

803
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,980
their exact location,
and we know how the Klan is.

804
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,820
I hear that. But the poll taxes
got to be our focus first.

805
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,387
'Cause black people are poor!
Black people are poor down here.

806
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,260
- Yep.
- And they expected to pay for every year

807
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,420
they weren't legally registered
before they can register.

808
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,305
Now, what the hell is that?
Who got that kind of money?

809
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,580
Come on now! Listen now!

810
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,260
The big issue is voting vouchers.

811
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,420
Is that the number one issue?

812
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,580
Now hold on. Let me finish.

813
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,220
'Cause everybody'll forget
about this part.

814
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,100
But if you're Negro,
the only way you can vote

815
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,780
is if an approved registered
voter vouches for you.

816
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,109
Right? So, let's say, you take
some place like Lowndes County,

817
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,220
where there are no Negroes
who are registered

818
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,260
and you've got to have
someone who is registered

819
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,100
to vouch for you.

820
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,506
What are you supposed to do?

821
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,460
Nobody you know,

822
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,780
not a single black person
for 100 miles is registered.

823
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,380
So how do you get the voucher, right?

824
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,820
To get you into the courthouse door

825
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,300
to pay the poll tax

826
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,821
to get your name published

827
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,460
and get yourself dead.

828
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,900
That's true.

829
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,500
We need a new plan!

830
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,180
I can't take him back to Washington

831
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,060
and waltz into the White House
with a list of empty demands.

832
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,020
Tactics, my friends!

833
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,740
We must break down this institution

834
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,830
into the tangible tactics
that it takes to dismantle it.

835
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,140
What's your next move?

836
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,500
A march from Selma to Montgomery
to protest and amplify.

837
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,540
Well, I'll be damned.

838
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,020
This was always part of the plan,
wasn't it?

839
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,144
Provoke some tragedy
in little old Selma, then go big.

840
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,147
Get someone killed
and march on the State Capitol!

841
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,100
Selma to Montgomery's gotta be 50 miles!

842
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,900
You march those people
into rural Alabama unprotected,

843
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,140
it's gonna be open season.

844
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,700
It's too damn far
and too damn dangerous!

845
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,660
Then propose new legislation, sir.

846
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,431
I can't do that this year. I won't!
I told you.

847
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,860
We need your involvement here,
Mr. President.

848
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,580
We deserve your help
as citizens of this country.

849
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,020
Citizens under attack.

850
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,940
Now, you listen to me. You listen to me.

851
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,900
You're an activist. I'm a politician.

852
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,580
You got one big issue.
I got a hundred and one.

853
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,620
Now, you demanding more

854
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,020
and putting me on the spot
with this visit, that's okay.

855
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,860
That's your job. That's what you do.

856
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,540
But I am sick and tired

857
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:26,300
of you demanding and telling me
what I can and what I can't do.

858
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,100
If you want my support
on this voting thing,

859
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,302
I need some quid pro quo from you.

860
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,060
What do you want, Mr. President?

861
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,582
We have a line on some threats that are

862
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,420
particularly troubling.

863
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,220
Well, what's new?

864
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,900
No, no. This is serious.
Credible threats with detail.

865
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,785
This information,
coming from the FBI, I assume?

866
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,026
High-level?

867
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,900
The same high-level
that's been tracking us like animals?

868
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,786
Bugging our homes and our hotel rooms.

869
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,867
Digging for things that
simply are not there, Lee?

870
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,460
This all feels very convenient.

871
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,906
Okay.

872
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,740
This is coming
from Lowndes County, Alabama.

873
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,068
Between Selma and Montgomery.

874
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,940
I'm telling you, if he were my guy,

875
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,541
I'd keep him off the frontlines.

876
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,586
Just for a while.

877
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,900
Not gonna happen, Lee.

878
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,180
Meet me halfway on this, Martin.

879
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,340
I can't, Mr. President.

880
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,100
Can't or won't?

881
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,749
I came here hoping
to talk to you about people.

882
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,900
People are dying in the street for this.

883
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,580
It cannot wait, sir.

884
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,582
Mr. President, how did it go?

885
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,630
What can I do to help?

886
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,627
Get me J. Edgar Hoover.

887
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,186
King,

888
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,020
you know you are a complete fraud

889
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,140
and a liability to all nigras.

890
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,469
Like all frauds,
your end is approaching.

891
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,944
You are done.

892
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,581
Your degrees and your fancy awards
will not save you.

893
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,820
The American public will
soon know you for what you are,

894
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,388
an evil, abnormal beast.

895
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,065
That wasn't me.

896
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,829
That isn't me, Corrie.

897
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,586
I know.

898
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,751
I know what you sound like.

899
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,748
I've gotten used to a lot.

900
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,666
All the hours
wondering after your safety,

901
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,467
worried about how you are.

902
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,581
This house.

903
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,020
Renting here.

904
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,864
No foundation.

905
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,780
Without the things
the children should have,

906
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,108
all because of how it would look.

907
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,667
I have gotten used to it,

908
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,151
for better or worse.

909
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,908
But what I have never gotten used to

910
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,268
is the death.

911
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,028
The constant closeness of death.

912
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,629
It's become like a thick fog to me.

913
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,460
I can't see life sometimes

914
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,870
because of the fog of death
constantly hanging over.

915
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,020
People actually say that
they will stop the blood

916
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,500
running through the hearts
of our children.

917
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,022
That's what they said on the other end
of that phone line.

918
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,946
How they're going to kill my children.

919
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,980
And what they'll do to you
and how they'll do it.

920
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,500
How many years
have I had to listen to this?

921
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,700
The filth,

922
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,543
deranged and twisted
and just ignorant enough to be serious.

923
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,509
If I ask you something,

924
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,542
will you answer me with the truth?

925
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,661
Yes.

926
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,589
Good, because I am not a fool.

927
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,263
Do you love me?

928
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,707
Yes, I love you, Coretta.

929
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,387
Do you love any of the others?

930
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,989
No.

931
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,106
I need to put the march back a day.

932
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,581
Why?

933
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,187
I have to be home right now.

934
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,903
Yes. Okay. I understand.

935
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,620
But I have to tell you
the organization looks good.

936
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,220
Real good.

937
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,620
The mood is strong.
And the locals are prepared.

938
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,460
The SNCC kids are ready to go.

939
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:18,667
We can start it off from Selma,
and you can join in on the second day.

940
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,340
I just think it'd be a mistake
to hold people back

941
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,065
when their blood is up.

942
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,020
I hear you, but we need
to be out there full throttle.

943
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,660
This ain't a test run.

944
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,180
We need to get to Montgomery.

945
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,820
I warned Johnson that
we were going to the Capitol.

946
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,863
We need to do just that.

947
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,182
And I believe we will. We'll get there.

948
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,220
And when we do the real deal,
the finale,

949
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,380
when you make the big speech at the end,

950
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,821
right on Wallace's doorstep.

951
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,026
I don't know, Andy.

952
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,183
It'll be just fine.

953
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,426
We'll get it started strong.
And you'll finish strong.

954
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,062
Okay. Let's proceed.

955
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,580
But only one of us walks to start.

956
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,751
I don't want to get back on Monday
and find all our leadership in jail.

957
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,860
One of us walks.

958
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,950
Understood.

959
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,944
There will be no march
from Selma to Montgomery.

960
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,740
It is not conducive to traffic flow
on Route 80.

961
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,260
Or to public safety.

962
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,940
Your lives could be in danger,

963
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,220
but we're going to be strong
if we stick together.

964
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,663
Don't fight back.
It's a non-violent movement.

965
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,149
Non-violence is not passive.
It's actually very strong.

966
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,900
We shouldn't do this, John.
This is not us. This is not SNCC.

967
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,260
It's some bullshit.

968
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,669
It's gonna do more for King
and the SCLC than for Selma.

969
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,100
This is Alabama.

970
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,580
They can keep their asses
in Washington, D.C.

971
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,900
You don't tell us how to live our lives.

972
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,300
This is an example of what
you might deal with out there.

973
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,460
What you might experience.
Here we go. Let's show them.

974
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,460
We don't want your kind here.

975
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,140
Go to the bottom of the river,
black boy.

976
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,820
We're going to put you down
in Alabama River!

977
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,060
He's not even here.
How's it gonna do more for him?

978
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,940
Well, why ain't he here, then, man?

979
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,980
Are you listening to yourself?

980
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,380
First, it's gonna do more for him.
Now, it's why he ain't here?

981
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,900
Do you want him here,
or do you not want him here?

982
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,660
Honestly, I don't give a rat's ass
about that man. That's your hero.

983
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,660
Let's take these bastards
and stick them down into Alabama River

984
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,940
and never see them again.

985
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,460
James, you are so off-base with this.

986
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,300
All this nonsense.
This ain't what SNCC is about.

987
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,500
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy here, John.

988
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,300
I'm not!
You're the one playing me small.

989
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,150
Don't demonize me...

990
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,668
You're mad because they called him in.

991
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,980
We were here first.
And they called him in.

992
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,620
I get it. I understand that.

993
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,020
But if we are really
and truly for the people,

994
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,541
and the people of Selma chose him,

995
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,988
well, then the people have spoken.

996
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,189
And if they want to march,
then I'm marching with them.

997
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,865
Then, brother,

998
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,381
you're marching as John Lewis.

999
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,944
Not as part of SNCC.

1000
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,862
It's been voted on and decided.

1001
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,825
For this march, you're on your own
with De Lawd and his disciples.

1002
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,789
Short man wins. Short man wins.

1003
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,910
Short man wins.

1004
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,746
All right.

1005
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,908
All right. Who got it?

1006
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,060
It's on you, Hosea.

1007
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,700
You ready, young blood? You ready?

1008
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,346
- All right. Let's do this.
- All right.

1009
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,580
About 525 Negroes
had left Brown's Chapel

1010
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,304
and walked six blocks to cross
Pettus Bridge and the Alabama River.

1011
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,860
There were young and old,

1012
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,740
and they carried an assortment of packs,

1013
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,022
bed rolls and lunch sacks.

1014
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,350
The troopers were waiting
300 yards beyond the end of the bridge.

1015
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,349
Behind the troopers
were dozens of possemen,

1016
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,821
15 of them on horses,
and perhaps 100 white spectators.

1017
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,949
Can you swim?

1018
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,501
Not many swimming pools for black folk
where I come from.

1019
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,190
Yeah.

1020
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,948
Andy. It's Bayard. Everybody there?

1021
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,100
Yes.

1022
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,380
Turn on CBS right now, Andy.

1023
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,820
Right now. You have a TV there?

1024
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,989
- Yes. Now?
- Right now!

1025
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,064
Turn on the television set.

1026
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,144
We interrupt this program to bring you
a special bulletin from CBS News.

1027
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,220
Give 'em two minutes. Stand right there.

1028
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,785
We're ready.

1029
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,980
This is an unlawful assembly.

1030
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,380
You have two minutes to disperse.

1031
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,300
Go home or go to your church.

1032
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,583
This march will not continue.

1033
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,949
Two minutes.

1034
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,945
May I have a word with the Major?

1035
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,183
There's no word to be had.

1036
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,503
Major Cloud, may we speak with you?

1037
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,224
Troopers, advance!

1038
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,420
Seventy million people
are watching this.

1039
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,420
The first 10 or 20 Negroes

1040
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,260
were swept to the ground screaming,
arms and legs flying,

1041
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,623
packs and bags went skittering
across the grassy divider.

1042
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,820
Those still on their feet retreated.

1043
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,940
A cheer went up
from the white spectators

1044
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,790
lining the south side of the highway.

1045
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,020
Come on. You gotta come on.

1046
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,346
Please, don't...

1047
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,980
The troopers continued pushing,
using both the force of their bodies

1048
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,625
and the prodding of their nightsticks.

1049
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,820
Suddenly, there was a sharp sound,
like a gunshot,

1050
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:19,020
and a gray cloud spewed over
the troopers and the Negroes.

1051
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,620
But before the cloud hid it all,

1052
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,984
there were several seconds
of unobstructed view.

1053
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,300
Fifteen or 20 nightsticks
could be seen through the gas,

1054
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,151
flailing at the heads of the marchers.

1055
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,780
The Negroes cried out
as they crowded together for protection,

1056
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,142
and the whites on the sidelines
whooped and cheered.

1057
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,500
From the hospital
came reports of victims

1058
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,820
suffering fractures of ribs,
heads, arms and legs.

1059
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,900
And Negro leader John Lewis,

1060
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,300
despite injury from
a possible skull fracture,

1061
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,180
led the marchers back to the chapel

1062
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,462
after the encounter with officers.

1063
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,825
Help!

1064
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,341
Help!

1065
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,860
He said,
"I don't see how President Johnson

1066
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,471
"can send troops to Vietnam

1067
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,380
"and can't send troops
to Selma, Alabama."

1068
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,710
To which the Negroes present
roared their approval.

1069
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,180
Gerry! Gerry, come with us!
Come with us!

1070
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,540
We need your gun, man!

1071
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,980
I can't walk!

1072
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,660
Come with us. We know you got
them guns in the shed, Gerry.

1073
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,100
Hey, hey, hey, what you need guns for?

1074
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,860
The Bible says,
"An eye for an eye," Reverend.

1075
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,500
- Yeah?
- I'm sick of this shit!

1076
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,660
How many guns
you think they got down there?

1077
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,620
That's an entire army down there.

1078
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,020
What you got? A couple of .32s? A .38?

1079
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,420
Maybe a couple of old scatterguns? What?

1080
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,020
I got enough to kill a couple
of them crackers, that's what I got!

1081
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,380
And how many of us you think
they gonna kill in retaliation?

1082
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,580
With their 12-gauge pump-actions,
their Colt automatics,

1083
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,260
their Remingtons,
their helicopters, their tanks!

1084
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,380
We won't win that way,
and I ain't talking about the Bible.

1085
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,780
I ain't talking what's right by God.
I am talking facts. Cold, hard facts!

1086
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,220
Now, you take two of them,
and they take 10 of us.

1087
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,027
No. We have to win another way.

1088
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,582
...to our regularly scheduled program.

1089
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,308
We're going back to the bridge.

1090
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,307
We're going to finish this,
we promise you that, Ms. Amelia.

1091
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,383
We go again.

1092
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,100
Dr. King! Can we get a statement, sir?

1093
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,980
Dr. King! Morning, Doctor.
Can we get a statement, please?

1094
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,591
- Morning.
- Morning.

1095
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,430
While rageful violence continues
towards the unarmed people of Selma,

1096
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,420
while they are assaulted with tear gas
and batons like an enemy in a war,

1097
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,060
no citizen of this country
can call themselves blameless,

1098
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,946
for we all bear a responsibility
for our fellow man.

1099
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,460
I am appealing to men and women of God

1100
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,540
and goodwill everywhere,

1101
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,940
white, black and otherwise.

1102
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,780
If you believe all are created equal,
come to Selma.

1103
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,429
Join us. Join our march
against injustice and inhumanity.

1104
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,990
We need you to stand with us.

1105
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,500
Judge Johnson, Dr. King's call-to-action

1106
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,429
was nationally televised.

1107
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,820
We've seen hundreds of people
travel across the country

1108
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,660
to attend tomorrow's march,

1109
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,945
mostly white,
mostly clergy of some kind.

1110
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,540
The SCLC is seeking
a federal court order

1111
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:07,222
enjoining the state authorities
from interfering with the next march.

1112
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,540
You're asking me to overturn
the Governor's mandate

1113
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,660
and to do so without a hearing,

1114
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,060
but it's not going to happen at all
without a proper proceeding.

1115
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,100
Dr. King is in position to
lead tomorrow's march, Judge.

1116
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,180
Understood, but you will have
your day in court on Thursday, Mr. Gray.

1117
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,060
Meanwhile, there will be
no march tomorrow.

1118
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,786
I will not oppose Wallace
against protocol.

1119
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,024
"Thousands head south in moral crusade."

1120
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:41,109
The SCLC already filed an appeal
against Wallace's orders this morning.

1121
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,668
You want my advice, Mr. President?

1122
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,585
You have to ask?

1123
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,664
Give King the march to Montgomery.

1124
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,703
Do that, and then Selma's over.

1125
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,260
Then you're back in control.

1126
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,340
In control of what?

1127
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,300
Another civil war?

1128
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,820
This ain't about the goddamn march.
You think he cares about the march?

1129
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,626
He wants the law changed, now.

1130
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,580
I've got Congress
calling me by the dozens.

1131
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,180
I've got picketing that gets
bigger and bigger every day.

1132
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,951
He tugs on their goddamn
white liberal conscience.

1133
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,260
Every march pulls 'em.

1134
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,430
Especially when people
are getting beat up in the streets.

1135
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,346
These pictures are
going around the world, Lee.

1136
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,220
I understand, Mr. President.
All the more reason to act now.

1137
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,467
I'm gonna act now.

1138
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,900
You tell Wallace
and those backwater hicks

1139
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,060
I don't want to see any more
of this horseshit.

1140
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:40,260
And you tell King he best not march,
you hear me?

1141
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,780
Either King stops and Wallace stops,

1142
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,900
or I'll stop 'em both.

1143
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,547
I'm here on the President's order
to try and make this work.

1144
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,345
Please work with me.

1145
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,463
So we give up the march and you...

1146
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,865
You give what?

1147
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,220
We asked for federal protection.

1148
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,340
And with no disrespect, but when
the Assistant Attorney General

1149
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,500
is the highest-ranking
federal official in Selma,

1150
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,820
we have our answer.

1151
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,140
And it's not the one we want.

1152
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:13,940
Might I suggest that
you speak with Governor Wallace

1153
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,660
and Sheriff Clark
and urge them against violence

1154
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,501
instead of trying to persuade us
not to have a peaceful protest?

1155
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,303
Maybe we can make a deal.

1156
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,230
What if I

1157
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,980
could assure you that the administration

1158
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,865
would endorse a later march

1159
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,671
if tomorrow is called off?

1160
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,540
You know what?
He's closer than you may think

1161
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,391
to coming around on this issue.

1162
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,700
I believe this compromise
might be agreeable.

1163
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,140
Mr. Doar?

1164
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:57,708
Thousands have gathered here
to demonstrate their dignity.

1165
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,140
I don't want to challenge Judge Johnson.

1166
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,549
I don't want to go against the President.
I don't want any of this.

1167
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,020
The President could stop this
with a stroke of his pen.

1168
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,220
He chooses not to.

1169
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,900
The decision is with your side, sir,

1170
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,101
not ours.

1171
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,100
Good to see you, Father.
Good to see you.

1172
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,540
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming out.

1173
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,663
Hello, sister.
Good to see you this afternoon.

1174
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,100
You came.

1175
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,860
You called and we came, my friend.
You are not alone, my friend.

1176
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,100
Welcome, welcome.

1177
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,660
- Hi, what's your name?
- Susan.

1178
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,544
Hi, I'm Viola. Welcome to Selma.

1179
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,340
- Yes, ma'am, I'm good. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1180
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,020
What is your name
and where are you from, sir?

1181
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,900
My name is James Reeb.
I've come from Boston.

1182
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,422
Tell me, why have you traveled here,
Mr. Reeb?

1183
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,740
I heard about the attack
of innocent people

1184
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,305
who just want their rights,

1185
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:03,460
and I couldn't just stand by
when Dr. King put out that call to clergy.

1186
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,860
I couldn't.

1187
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,791
The President doesn't
want us to march today.

1188
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,700
The courts don't want us to march.

1189
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,780
But we must march.

1190
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,900
Yeah!

1191
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,700
- We must stand up.
- Yeah!

1192
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,746
We must make a massive
demonstration of our moral certainty.

1193
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:26,181
I'm so glad we're here together today.

1194
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,820
I thank you for standing up.

1195
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,060
For we shall be victorious in our quest.

1196
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,230
We shall cross the finish line
hand in hand.

1197
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,790
For we shall overcome. All right.

1198
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,625
Troopers, withdraw!

1199
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,620
My point is,
after what happened the last time,

1200
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,820
if it don't feel right, we don't do it.
That's my point.

1201
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,740
We've been going round
and round on this for hours,

1202
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,340
and nothing's gonna change the fact that

1203
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,300
it was Doc's decision
and we have to support him.

1204
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,980
This is a movement of many, not of one.

1205
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,580
So any choice we make
has to be right for many.

1206
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:00,940
Come on, Diane. Now, you know

1207
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,180
that's not what I meant
by that, all right?

1208
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,667
People are angry, Dr. King.

1209
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:09,900
Angry. They went back to that bridge
because they were hot about Sunday.

1210
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,900
That was our moment out there today.

1211
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,465
And you threw it away.

1212
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,340
They could've sealed off
the road behind us.

1213
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,465
No food, water,
no kind of support allowed through.

1214
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,620
We wouldn't have made 10 miles.

1215
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,185
You saying this was a trap?

1216
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,951
I don't know what it was.

1217
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,740
That was no trap!

1218
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,829
You know why they opened up
the road to us?

1219
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,100
Because all them nice,
respectable white folks was with us,

1220
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,940
and we should've capitalized on that.

1221
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,300
Because they're not gonna be
around here for long. They never are!

1222
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,620
It was Martin's call. It's done.

1223
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,500
He made the wrong goddamn call!

1224
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,940
Hey, watch your mouth, young man!

1225
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,620
Two days ago,
you didn't wanna march at all.

1226
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,100
And now you're mad because
it didn't go the way you planned?

1227
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,984
Calm down, brother.

1228
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,547
Now, what happened out there today?
You gotta tell us something. Please.

1229
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,820
I'd rather people be upset and hate me

1230
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,024
than be bleeding or dead.

1231
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,671
My dearest Corrie,

1232
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,742
at a time when I need you,

1233
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,708
I cannot call you.

1234
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,942
And I have done this to myself, to us.

1235
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,628
At this late hour,

1236
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,020
my thoughts are of you

1237
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,986
and all you have sacrificed
for this struggle.

1238
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,470
So many have sacrificed.

1239
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,986
So many have been lost.

1240
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,867
I wonder how many must we lose.

1241
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,911
I pray for discernment and guidance
as we journey on.

1242
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:07,062
I pray, too, that I can justify
the faith you once had in me.

1243
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:16,385
I, too, often feel that
heavy fog you spoke of, Corrie.

1244
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,906
Only you and our family clears the haze.

1245
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,190
Love, Martin.

1246
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,266
He betrayed trust.

1247
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,820
He called, we came,
and he didn't fulfill his own call.

1248
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,020
Yeah, but sometimes
it's not that clear-cut.

1249
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,507
Sometimes it's instinctual.

1250
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,144
Like when you're preaching,

1251
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,549
and you're just flying.

1252
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,860
You know, you're not on the notes.
You're not on memory.

1253
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,543
You're tapped into what's higher,
what's true.

1254
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,751
God is guiding you.

1255
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,629
I've known that feeling.
It's rare, but I've known it.

1256
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,780
I think that's what happened to Dr. King
up there on the bridge today.

1257
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,340
He kneeled down,
prayed to God and got an answer.

1258
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,300
And he was brave enough
to follow that answer,

1259
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,260
and I, for one, don't fault him for it.

1260
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,747
Except he owes me a bus ticket home.

1261
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,700
You know what I hate more than niggers?

1262
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,231
What's that?

1263
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,986
White niggers.

1264
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,300
Look, we don't want trouble, okay?

1265
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,264
No, you came here stirrin' trouble.

1266
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,707
Doc,

1267
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,985
someone's been hurt.

1268
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,789
A priest, from Boston.

1269
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,501
White.

1270
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,300
Now you know what
being a nigger around here

1271
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,264
feels like, boy.

1272
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,067
Hurt? How?

1273
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,066
Dead.

1274
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,425
I need a phone!

1275
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,540
Chicago, Detroit, Boston, I don't care.

1276
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,220
Hell, you got 2,000 people
marching up in Harlem.

1277
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,380
Well, good for you.

1278
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,020
But when you have people
come inside the White House?

1279
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,905
Inside the White House! On a tour?

1280
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,420
They just sat down, Martin.

1281
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,260
They sat down in the main corridor,
started singin' and shoutin'.

1282
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,500
Well, I won't have it!

1283
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,980
I cannot stop people from expressing...

1284
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,864
You can! You can stop them.

1285
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,700
No, you can stop it.
You, sir, can do more.

1286
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,940
Now I'm glad to hear that you
called Reverend Reeb's widow, sir.

1287
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,980
That is very fine, and it is right.

1288
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,060
I only wish that
Jimmie Lee Jackson's family

1289
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,740
would have received the same
consideration from their President.

1290
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,820
Don't you lay your guilt at my door.

1291
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,300
You're the one choosing to send

1292
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,020
people out to slaughter
when we told you there was trouble.

1293
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,260
We won't sit idle

1294
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,100
while you wait another year or two
to send this bill up at your leisure.

1295
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,260
That should be clear by now.

1296
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,180
We will continue to demonstrate
until you take action, sir.

1297
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,420
And if our President
won't protect our rights,

1298
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,031
we will take this fight to court.

1299
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,260
You know, I'm... I'm trying here.

1300
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,980
We're getting close
to figuring something out

1301
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,104
on this voting thing,
but I will not have this!

1302
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:47,060
This bill has been almost impossible
to craft, you hear me?

1303
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,662
You think you're jugglin', Martin?
I'm jugglin', too.

1304
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,548
I am a preacher from Atlanta.

1305
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,820
You are the man who won the presidency

1306
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,620
of the world's most powerful nation

1307
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,142
by the greatest landslide
in history four months ago.

1308
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,620
And you are the man

1309
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:08,030
dismantling your own legacy
with each passing day.

1310
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,502
No one will remember
the Civil Rights Act.

1311
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,540
But they will remember
the standoff in Selma

1312
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:17,300
when you never even
set foot in this state.

1313
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,940
They will remember you saying,
"Wait, " and "I can't,"

1314
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,542
unless you act, sir.

1315
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,269
- Evenin'.
- Evenin'.

1316
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,741
I wanted to speak privately.

1317
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,340
I know there's been trouble
with the group,

1318
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:04,909
and I apologize that our efforts
have caused a rift between y'all.

1319
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,221
That's a painful thing, I know,
and I'm truly sorry it's happened.

1320
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,704
Yeah, painful.

1321
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,271
LBJ is not moving, John.

1322
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,900
I thought he would,
but our efforts are not working,

1323
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,340
and I can't risk another march
with people getting killed

1324
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,304
when it's not working. I won't do it.

1325
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,503
We need voting, not marching.
You know that.

1326
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:40,620
We have to move beyond these protests
to some real political power.

1327
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,141
This can't go on forever like this.

1328
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,788
I can't go on like this.

1329
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,190
When I was...

1330
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:10,065
When I was working with SNCC
on the Freedom Rides,

1331
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,222
the Montgomery bus
reached the city limits.

1332
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,346
We got off. And out of nowhere,

1333
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:25,711
from all directions, they came.

1334
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,708
There was men, women.

1335
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,265
Kids, too.

1336
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:42,620
They had just about every makeshift
weapon you could think of.

1337
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,551
I mean, bats, bricks,

1338
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,381
tire irons, pipes.

1339
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,909
I remember...

1340
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:01,380
I remember this little girl
just clawing her nails

1341
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:05,420
into the side of my friend Jessie's face

1342
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,705
while her daddy...
Her daddy beat him with an ax handle.

1343
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,500
Jessie was unconscious,

1344
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,182
and they just kept beating on him
and beating on him.

1345
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,542
I must've passed out
on the asphalt somewhere.

1346
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,943
Next day, I found myself patched up
and sitting in a church.

1347
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:39,301
I could barely hold my head up,
but I needed to be there.

1348
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,302
You were gonna be speaking.

1349
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,342
And I needed to hear you.

1350
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,944
And I was feeling down,
but you got up there.

1351
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,110
You remember that day at all?

1352
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,630
I don't think we remember it
the same way.

1353
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,744
What'd I say, John?

1354
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,421
I'm about to tell you right now.

1355
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,629
And I hope you hear me.

1356
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,386
You said that we would triumph.

1357
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,787
That we would triumph
because there could be no other way.

1358
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,783
And you know what else you said?

1359
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,867
You said,

1360
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,305
"Fear not.

1361
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,704
"We've come too far to turn back now."

1362
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:54,100
I feel good about where we are.
We have a strong case.

1363
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,631
- We can do this.
- Right.

1364
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,900
Now, Ms. Cooper
and Ms. Boynton are here,

1365
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,387
and they need to be ready.

1366
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:06,620
A lot depends
on what they have to say. Okay?

1367
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,310
I hear what you're saying, but...

1368
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,665
You're here.

1369
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,949
Yes, I'm here.

1370
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,860
I'm glad.

1371
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,828
Just in time.

1372
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:01,420
In the matter of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference

1373
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,900
v. The state of Alabama,

1374
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,661
I will now hear testimony
from the plaintiffs. Mr. Gray.

1375
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,060
Your Honor, you will hear testimony
from the victims

1376
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,380
who were beaten and bludgeoned
in their quest for freedom.

1377
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,550
For their right to vote
and to self-determine.

1378
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,260
The fact of the matter, Your Honor,

1379
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,430
is that the incidents that occurred
cannot be disputed.

1380
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,261
These particular circumstances

1381
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:30,230
will paint a thorough picture
of the horrific events endured in Selma.

1382
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,980
Very well, you may proceed.

1383
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:37,310
Mr. King, you went out on that bridge
in direct violation of that judge's orders.

1384
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,467
You deliberately disobeyed this judge
and the Governor, did you not?

1385
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,700
Thousands of people came to Selma,

1386
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,904
aroused by Sunday's brutal acts

1387
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:52,860
exacted by officials
of the city of Selma

1388
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,780
and the state of Alabama.

1389
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,900
I felt if I had not led the march,

1390
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,220
pent-up emotions and inner tensions
would have led to an uncontrollable

1391
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,502
retaliatory situation,

1392
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,220
a violent situation on both sides.

1393
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,100
I don't need any of your preaching
and prancing in here,

1394
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,460
you hear? I want an answer.

1395
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:14,186
- Objection.
- Watch it, counselor.

1396
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,940
I'm trying very hard, Judge.

1397
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,665
Try harder, counselor.

1398
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,420
It seems basic to
our constitutional principles

1399
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,829
that the extent
of the right to assemble,

1400
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,260
and demonstrate and march

1401
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,020
along the highway in a peaceful manner

1402
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:35,740
ought to be commensurate

1403
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,020
with the enormity of the wrongs

1404
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,951
that are being protested
and petitioned against.

1405
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:46,308
In this case, the wrongs are enormous.

1406
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,906
Therefore,

1407
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,020
the extent of the right to demonstrate

1408
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:57,702
in an estimated five-day march
from Selma to Montgomery

1409
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:00,064
has been approved accordingly.

1410
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:02,342
- Yes!
- Thank God!

1411
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,780
There's no further business
with this court.

1412
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,701
These proceedings are concluded,
with our thanks to the litigants.

1413
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,829
Good day, gentlemen.

1414
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,180
Yeah, that's right.

1415
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:33,060
Well, now, we don't like
to have no mistakes, if you...

1416
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,421
If you're sure about it.

1417
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:39,020
Bayard says that Harry says
he can get Nina Simone,

1418
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:43,350
Dick Gregory, Joan Baez,
Peter, Paul and Mary in.

1419
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,780
Come on now.
We don't got money for that.

1420
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:48,380
Well, Harry is chartering
a plane himself.

1421
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,550
Day-O, day-O

1422
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:56,220
Daylight come and me wan' go home

1423
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:01,790
President's angling for your blocking
of the march to be overturned.

1424
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,940
Unfortunately, all my maneuvers
have been put on hold

1425
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,984
while the matter's being adjudicated.

1426
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,740
Governor, you wanted to talk.

1427
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,947
Well, Mr. President...

1428
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:27,388
Malcontents are disrupting Alabama,
and it's your responsibility to stop them.

1429
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,700
They're protesting
about the right to vote

1430
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,140
and the way they're treated
in your state.

1431
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:38,380
So that's your problem,
your responsibility,

1432
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,582
and it's on your watch.

1433
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,308
Mr. President, I disagree.

1434
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,220
We have a certain way things are done.
It's the way it is.

1435
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,582
And it's the way
the people want it to stay.

1436
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:53,900
George, why are you doing this?

1437
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,900
Your whole career
has been working for the poor.

1438
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,784
Why are you off on this black thing?

1439
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,951
Well, 'cause you can't
ever satisfy them.

1440
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,740
First, it's the front seat of the bus.

1441
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,500
Next, it's take over the parks,

1442
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,989
then it's the public schools,
then it's voting, then it's jobs,

1443
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,469
then it's distribution of wealth
without work.

1444
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,900
George, you seen all those demonstrators

1445
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,300
out front of the White House

1446
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,580
keeping my Lady Bird awake
the whole damn night?

1447
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,620
Oh, yes, Mr. President. I saw them.

1448
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,580
Well, let's go out there, you and I,

1449
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:31,421
and announce that you've decided to
let the blacks vote undeterred,

1450
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,460
and this whole mess will go away.

1451
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,630
And I don't have to draft bills
or force the issue.

1452
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,780
Now, why don't we do that, George?

1453
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,824
Why don't you just let the niggers vote?

1454
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,700
You agree they got
the right to vote, don't you?

1455
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,620
There's no quarrel with that.

1456
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,902
I know that. That's the law.

1457
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,663
Then why don't you just let 'em vote?

1458
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,700
I don't have that power.
It belongs to the county registrars.

1459
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,790
Now, don't shit me
about who runs Alabama.

1460
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,460
I don't have any legal power

1461
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,470
over the county registrars,
Mr. President.

1462
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,822
They have their regulations
and they adhere.

1463
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:10,180
Are you trying to shit me,
George Wallace?

1464
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,540
Are you trying
to fuck over your President?

1465
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:13,820
Mr. President...

1466
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,140
We shouldn't even
be thinking about 1965.

1467
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,071
We should be thinking about 1985.

1468
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,908
You and I'll be
both dead and gone by then.

1469
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,140
In 1985, what do you want looking back?

1470
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:26,980
You want people remembering you sayin',

1471
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:31,629
"Wait," or "I can't,"
or, "It's too hard"?

1472
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,460
I don't right care what they think,

1473
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,027
and you shouldn't neither.

1474
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,021
Well...

1475
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,460
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let history

1476
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,028
put me in the same place
as the likes of you.

1477
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,143
I speak tonight for the dignity of man

1478
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,903
and the destiny of democracy.

1479
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:07,980
At times, history and fate

1480
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:12,071
meet at a single time in a single place.

1481
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:18,227
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.

1482
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,544
There, long suffering men and women

1483
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,380
peacefully protested the denial
of their rights as Americans.

1484
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,620
Rarely in any time

1485
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,222
does an issue lay bare the secret heart

1486
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,988
of America itself.

1487
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,380
The issue for equal rights
for the American Negro

1488
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,423
is that issue.

1489
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,266
For this issue,

1490
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,786
many of them were brutally assaulted.

1491
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:59,023
There is no Negro problem.
There is no Southern problem.

1492
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,784
There is only an American problem.

1493
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,660
The Constitution says that

1494
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:12,300
no person shall be kept from voting

1495
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,151
because of his race or color.

1496
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:20,260
To correct the denial
of this fundamental right,

1497
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:24,860
this Wednesday,
I will send to Congress a law

1498
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:29,145
designed to eliminate
these illegal barriers.

1499
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,980
The bill will strike down

1500
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,820
voting restrictions in all elections,

1501
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:39,741
federal, state and local.

1502
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,468
And we shall do this.

1503
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,828
We shall overcome.

1504
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,460
We believe we can cover you
through Lowndes County,

1505
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:12,140
but once we add the final day's march
through Montgomery,

1506
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,860
and you're passing through
all those tall buildings and whatnot,

1507
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,028
coverage becomes challenging.

1508
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,101
So please consider

1509
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,700
driving in on the final leg.

1510
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:27,461
And please consider nixing
the speech at the Capitol.

1511
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,740
Well, if Wallace will see us
when we arrive,

1512
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,022
there'll be no need for a speech.

1513
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,984
Can you arrange that?

1514
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,071
I can't hide.

1515
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,385
We can't hide. You understand.

1516
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,951
I don't want to see this
go wrong for you.

1517
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,747
Don't you want
to protect yourself, Doctor?

1518
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,582
Let me try to do that.

1519
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,540
You know, I know you want to live to see

1520
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:10,141
the fruits of all this work.
I know you do.

1521
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,860
I'm just asking you to allow us
to help you do that.

1522
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,060
I'm no different than anybody else.

1523
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,865
I want to live long and be happy.

1524
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,422
But I'll not be focusing
on what I want today.

1525
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,501
I'm focused on what God wants.

1526
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:49,263
We're here for a reason,
through many, many storms.

1527
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,220
But, today, the sun is shining,
and I'm about to stand in its warmth

1528
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:01,823
alongside a lot of freedom-loving people
who worked hard to get us here.

1529
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:07,310
I may not be with them
for all the sunny days to come,

1530
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,304
but as long as there
is light ahead for them,

1531
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,223
it's worth it to me.

1532
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,310
Thank you, John.

1533
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:15,504
We heard them say
we'd never make it here.

1534
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:21,982
We heard them say they'd stop us,
if it was the last thing they did.

1535
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,985
We heard them say
we don't deserve to be here.

1536
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:34,030
But today, we stand as Americans.

1537
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,350
We are here,

1538
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:43,383
and we ain't gonna let nobody
turn us around.

1539
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:47,351
This mighty march,

1540
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,340
which will be counted
as one of the greatest

1541
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:54,260
demonstrations of protest and progress,

1542
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:57,980
ends here in the Capitol ofAlabama

1543
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,262
for a vital purpose.

1544
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:04,940
We have not fought only
for the right to sit where we please

1545
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,100
and go to school where we please.

1546
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:12,510
We do not only strive here today
to vote as we please.

1547
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,300
But with our commitment,

1548
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:19,540
we give birth each day to a new energy

1549
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:23,301
that is stronger than
our strongest opposition.

1550
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:28,740
And we embrace
this new energy so boldly,

1551
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:31,260
embody it so fervently,

1552
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,623
that its reflection illuminates
a great darkness.

1553
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:40,788
Our society has distorted who we are.

1554
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,631
From slavery to the Reconstruction

1555
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,300
to the precipice at which we now stand,

1556
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:54,303
we have seen powerful
white men rule the world

1557
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:59,621
while offering poor white men
a vicious lie as placation.

1558
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:03,500
And when the poor white man's children

1559
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:07,182
wail with a hunger
that cannot be satisfied,

1560
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:11,387
he feeds them that same vicious lie.

1561
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,821
A lie whispering to them

1562
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,701
that regardless of their lot in life,

1563
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:22,100
they can at least be triumphant
in the knowledge

1564
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:27,101
that their whiteness makes
them superior to blackness.

1565
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:29,070
But we know the truth.

1566
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:35,626
We know the truth, and we will
go forward to that truth, to freedom.

1567
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,629
We will not be stopped.

1568
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,990
We will march for our rights.

1569
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:48,700
We will march to demand
treatment as full citizens.

1570
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,460
We will march until the viciousness
and the darkness

1571
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,028
gives way to the light of righteousness.

1572
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:00,580
No man, no myth,

1573
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:04,980
no malaise will stop this movement.

1574
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:09,740
We forbid it.
For we know that it is this darkness

1575
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:14,104
that murders the best in us
and the best of us.

1576
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,420
Whether Jimmie Lee Jackson
or James Reeb,

1577
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:24,462
or four blameless little girls

1578
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:28,830
struck down before they had even begun.

1579
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:35,420
You may ask, when will we
be free of this darkness?

1580
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,146
I say to you today,
my brothers and sisters,

1581
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:41,700
despite the pain, despite the tears,

1582
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:44,426
our freedom will soon be upon us.

1583
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:51,629
For "truth crushed to earth
will rise again."

1584
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,741
When will we be free?

1585
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:59,860
Soon, and very soon.

1586
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:03,348
Because you shall reap what you sow.

1587
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,750
When will we be free?

1588
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:11,902
Soon, and very soon.

1589
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,590
Because no lie can live forever.

1590
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,180
When will we be free?

1591
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,580
Soon, and very soon

1592
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:26,300
because "Mine eyes have seen

1593
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,220
"the glory of the coming of the Lord.

1594
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,500
"He is trampling out the vintage

1595
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,900
"where the grapes of wrath are stored.

1596
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,900
"He hath loosed the fateful lightning

1597
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,140
"of his terrible swift sword.

1598
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,340
"His truth is marching on.

1599
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:47,079
"Glory! Hallelujah!

1600
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:50,389
"His truth is marching on."
