00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,523
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,968
<i>and we will see how well you know it.</i>

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,171
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,562
<i>there were two kingdoms
that were the worst of neighbors.</i>

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,564
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,246
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,648
<i>or a terrible villain
might bring them together.</i>

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,008
<i>In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,</i>

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,482
<i>with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.</i>

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,089
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,289
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,766
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,010
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,280
<i>And they needed
neither king nor queen,</i>

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,010
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,241
<i>In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors</i>

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,721
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,770
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,363
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,367
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,725
There you go.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,370
<i>And her name</i>

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,965
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,804
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,690
I love your cap!

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,163
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,561
You missed me!

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,208
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,490
Lovely work, girls!

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
What's all the fuss about?

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,847
The border guards have discov...

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
I want to!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,130
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,606
No, you told last time,

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,201
Tell me what?

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,567
Fine!

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,961
Thank you.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,920
Maleficent, the border guard...

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,328
The border guards have found
a human thief at the pool of jewels.

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,811
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,847
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,523
Humans, here.
I hope there's not another war.

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,404
I'm not afraid.

46
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,848
Besides,
I have never seen a human up close.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,001
Come out!

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,251
No. They mean to kill me.

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,920
And besides, they're hideous to look at.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,970
That's extremely rude.

51
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,008
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,170
It's not right to steal,

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,602
but we don't kill people for it.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,727
Come out.

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,611
Come out this instant!

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,606
Are you fully grown?

57
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,521
No.

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,802
I believe he's just a boy.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,964
And you're just a girl.

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,166
I think.

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,241
Who are you?

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,245
I'm called Stefan.

63
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,041
Who are you?

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,761
I'm Maleficent.

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,811
Yes, right.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,401
You have to give it back.

67
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,446
Give what back?

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,246
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,606
I didn't throw it away.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,084
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

71
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,886
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

72
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,889
In the castle.

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,965
Where do you live now?

74
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,641
In a barn.

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,124
So your parents are farmers, then?

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,282
My parents are dead.

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,766
Mine, too.

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,890
We'll see each other again.

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,526
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,170
It's not safe.

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,687
And if I made that choice,

82
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,769
if I came back, would you be here?

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,807
Perhaps.

84
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,604
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,891
Iron burns fairies.

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,407
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,484
I like your wings.

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,041
<i>Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,</i>

89
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,687
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

90
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,768
<i>so that their hands might touch again,</i>

91
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,564
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

92
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,923
<i>Thus did the young thief
who had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,001
Maleficent!

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,526
<i>...steal something far more precious.</i>

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,530
Maleficent?

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,566
Maleficent!

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
After all these weeks,

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,490
look who came back.

99
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,482
I thought it worth the risk.

100
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,407
So, what do you do for fun?

101
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,125
<i>Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.</i>

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,366
<i>And for a time it seemed as if,
in them at least,</i>

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,805
<i>the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.</i>

104
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,890
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,321
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,767
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,726
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

108
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,848
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

109
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,721
<i>As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>

110
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,600
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,204
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>

112
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,250
<i>rose to become
the protector of the Moors.</i>

113
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,041
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

114
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,164
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>

115
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,042
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>

116
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,248
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,085
<i>For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>

118
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,084
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

119
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,963
Guard, halt!

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,650
Guard, halt!

121
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,205
There they are,

122
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,125
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture

123
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,522
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.

124
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,122
Well, I say crush them!

125
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,248
Go no further!

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,570
A king

127
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,281
does not take orders from a winged elf.

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,323
You are no king to me.

129
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,247
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,801
Advance!

131
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,443
Arise and stand with me!

132
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,770
Hold the line!

133
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,046
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!

134
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,647
Charge!

135
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,201
You!

136
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,406
To the king!

137
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,250
You will not have the Moors!

138
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,363
Not now, nor ever!

139
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,881
You...

140
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,006
When I ascended to the throne,

141
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,246
I promised the people

142
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,485
one day we would take

143
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
the Moors and its treasures.

144
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,610
Each of you

145
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,281
swore allegiance to me
and to that cause.

146
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,881
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,768
Defeated in battle.

148
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,489
Is this to be my legacy?

149
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,647
I see you waiting for me to die.

150
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,569
It won't be long. But what then?

151
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,009
I will choose a successor

152
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,849
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.

153
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,606
Who among you

154
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,329
is worthy?

155
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,329
Kill the winged creature.

156
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,084
Avenge me,

157
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,326
and upon my death
you will take the crown.

158
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,529
Maleficent.

159
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,568
Maleficent!

160
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,210
So, how is life with the humans?

161
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,289
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

162
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,205
They mean to kill you.

163
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,767
King Henry will stop at nothing.

164
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,563
Please, you have to trust me.

165
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,687
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

166
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,524
<i>and the years faded</i> away.

167
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,329
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>

168
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,163
<i>and all was as it had been long ago.</i>

169
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,366
You thirsty?

170
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,651
Maleficent?

171
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,561
What is this?

172
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,921
I have avenged you, sire.

173
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,762
She is vanquished?

174
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,648
You have done well, my son.

175
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,447
You have done
what others feared to do.

176
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,602
You will be rewarded.

177
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,330
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,

178
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,605
Your Majesty.

179
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,050
I've got you!

180
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,528
- You wicked bird!
- lnto a man.

181
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,531
It's a...

182
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,846
It's a demon!

183
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,171
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

184
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,208
Would you
rather I let them beat you to death?

185
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,411
I'm not certain.

186
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,084
Stop complaining.

187
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,290
I saved your life.

188
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,725
Forgive me.

189
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,766
What do I call you?

190
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,770
Diaval.

191
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,603
And in return for saving my life,
I am your servant.

192
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,170
Whatever you need.

193
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,726
Wings.

194
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,329
I need you to be my wings.

195
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,690
I present to you the first of his line,

196
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,562
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

197
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,764
He did this to me so he would be king.

198
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,610
Now what, Mistress?

199
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,764
Her wings!

200
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,481
It's a girl!

201
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,924
It's a girl! It's a girl!

202
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,367
Well?

203
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,243
Well, I saw nothing.

204
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,601
But there's been a...

205
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,281
What?

206
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,921
Child.

207
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,684
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.

208
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,682
There will be a christening.

209
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,209
They say it's to be a grand celebration.

210
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,682
A grand celebration for a baby.

211
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,526
How wonderful.

212
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,803
<i>All manner of folk
came to the christening,</i>

213
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,169
<i>even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.</i>

214
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,208
Look, there's the baby!

215
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,520
I love babies!

216
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,729
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.

217
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,011
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,651
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.

219
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,609
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

220
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,366
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses.

221
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,450
They bring gifts for our daughter.

222
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,328
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!

223
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,370
And very good with children.

224
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,930
Very well.

225
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,967
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

226
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,045
the gift of beauty.

227
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,801
My wish is that you will never be blue,

228
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,806
only happy, all the days of your life.

229
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,084
Sweet baby,

230
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,565
my wish for you is that you find...

231
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,321
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

232
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,609
Well, well.

233
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,040
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.

234
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,844
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...

235
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,446
How quaint.

236
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,723
Even the rabble.

237
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,564
I must say

238
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,881
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

239
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,130
You're not welcome here.

240
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,686
Oh, dear.

241
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,561
What an awkward situation.

242
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,405
You're not offended?

243
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,161
Why, no.

244
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,406
And to show I bear no ill will,

245
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,770
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

246
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,610
No! We don't want your gift!

247
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,084
Stay away from the princess!

248
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,162
Yes, stay away!

249
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,408
Listen well, all of you.

250
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,960
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

251
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,283
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

252
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,009
beloved by all who meet her.

253
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,051
That's a lovely gift.

254
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,480
Don't do this.

255
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,366
But

256
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,281
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,

257
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,641
she will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

258
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,406
and fall into a sleep like death,

259
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,490
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.

260
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,086
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.

261
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,283
I like you begging.

262
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,010
Do it again.

263
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,486
I beg you.

264
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,165
All right.

265
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,287
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

266
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,688
but only by

267
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,882
true love's kiss.

268
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,886
This curse will last till the end of time!

269
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,051
No power on Earth can change it.

270
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,570
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

271
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,371
<i>to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.</i>

272
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,322
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,</i>

273
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,371
<i>and thrown into the deepest dungeon
in the castle.</i>

274
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,483
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>

275
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,847
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

276
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,290
<i>who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.</i>

277
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,201
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>

278
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,369
<i>while his soldiers rode far and wide
to hunt Maleficent down.</i>

279
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,006
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

280
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,727
<i>that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch</i>

281
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,802
<i>of any human.</i>

282
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,965
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.</i>

283
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,647
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

284
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,691
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage
in the woods.</i>

285
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,971
No! Is this it?

286
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,329
Looks dreadful.

287
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,165
Come on.

288
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,011
We need a smaller...

289
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,206
Baby-

290
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,009
Or bigger bodies.

291
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,641
No, what we need is a proper disguise.

292
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,085
What do you mean?

293
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,083
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

294
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,280
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

295
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,969
So, gather around, ladies.

296
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,002
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

297
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,481
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

298
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,604
Now, there will be no questions asked.

299
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,681
We are no longer fairies.

300
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,451
We are three peasant women
raising our orphan child in the woods.

301
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,490
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.

302
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,406
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.

303
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,891
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.

304
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,126
It's in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,680
At least no one will find us here.

306
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,127
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?

307
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,202
Come on. There you go.

308
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,362
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

309
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,487
I hate you. Beasty.

310
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,771
<i>The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.</i>

311
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,131
Why is she crying?

312
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,565
I think she might be hungry.

313
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,251
Then feed her!

314
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,330
There you are.

315
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,880
There you go.

316
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,005
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.

317
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,770
It tickles.

318
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,969
- What?
- You're cheating.

319
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,520
I saw that!

320
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,808
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.

321
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,930
Greedy, bloated goat!

322
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,970
"Bloated goat."

323
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,160
Stop doing that.

324
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,605
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,006
Well, someone is.

326
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,401
It's not me.

327
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,047
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

328
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,966
Stop it!

329
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,161
Why...

330
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,209
No!

331
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,000
This is all your fault!

332
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,050
Come on. That's funny.

333
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,649
<i>As the days went on, Stefan darkened,</i>

334
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,963
<i>further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.</i>

335
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,766
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!

336
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,445
Flame!

337
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,241
Release!

338
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,891
Run!

339
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,121
You failed me.

340
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,124
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

341
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,521
Nothing is indestructible!

342
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,804
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!

343
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,282
Bring me the iron workers.

344
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,921
You!

345
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,726
Look.

346
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,642
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

347
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,721
What?

348
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,209
Hello.

349
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,207
Go away.

350
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,126
Go.

351
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,841
Go away.

352
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,282
I don't like children.

353
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,644
Up, UP-

354
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,882
Go along. Go, go, go.

355
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,130
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

356
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,326
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

357
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,971
Pretty bird.

358
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,280
<i>Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.</i>

359
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,850
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>

360
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,085
<i>so did she.</i>

361
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,161
Hello.

362
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,161
That's it.

363
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,371
There you go.

364
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,091
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

365
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,689
<i>and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.</i>

366
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,922
Curious little beasty.

367
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,082
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>

368
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,641
Look.

369
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,049
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.

370
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,165
Bring them to me.

371
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,409
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

372
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,200
Steady.

373
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,522
- It's her!
- It's her!

374
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,960
How could you do that to me?

375
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,043
You said anything I need.

376
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,321
Yeah, but not a dog.

377
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,525
It was a wolf, not a dog.

378
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,326
It's the same thing.

379
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,367
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

380
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,763
Fine. Next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.

381
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,401
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

382
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,770
I wonder.

383
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,926
I know you're there.

384
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,891
Don't be afraid.

385
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,846
I am not afraid.

386
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,684
Then come out.

387
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,489
Then you'll be afraid.

388
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,520
No, I won't.

389
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,806
I know who you are.

390
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,567
Do you?

391
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,888
You're my Fairy Godmother.

392
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,767
What?

393
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,844
Fairy Godmother.

394
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,567
You've been watching over me
my whole life.

395
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,202
I've always known you were close by.

396
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,846
How?

397
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,925
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.

398
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,085
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.

399
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,566
I remember you.

400
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,925
Pretty bird.

401
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,920
This is Diaval.

402
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,161
Hello, Aurora.

403
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,961
I have known you
since you were a little one.

404
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,566
It's everything I imagined it would be.

405
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,083
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...

406
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,962
Good night, beasty.

407
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,090
You mock me.

408
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,401
I know what you're doing.

409
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,289
I know exactly what you're doing.

410
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,361
Sire?

411
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,127
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

412
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,847
Leave me.

413
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,124
Sire, she is not well.

414
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,042
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.

415
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,048
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?

416
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,610
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

417
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,241
And on that day, I will be ready.

418
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,729
They're so beautiful.

419
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,248
I revoke the curse.

420
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,802
Let it be no more.

421
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,569
I revoke the curse.

422
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,641
Let it be no more.

423
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,569
I revoke my curse!

424
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,565
Let it be no more!

425
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,049
I revoke my curse!

426
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,924
Let it be no more!

427
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,925
Let it be no more!

428
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,487
<i>This curse will last till the end of time.</i>

429
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,166
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

430
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,560
Do all the Fair People have wings?

431
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,650
Most do.

432
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,923
Then why don't you?

433
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,002
All the other fairies fly.

434
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,646
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

435
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,804
That's all I wish to say about it.

436
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,284
What color were they?

437
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,406
Were they big?

438
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,043
So big
they dragged behind me when I walked.

439
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,762
And they were strong.

440
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,844
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.

441
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,210
And they never faltered, not even once.

442
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,160
I could trust them.

443
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,930
She's coming. She's coming.

444
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,007
Where are your workers?

445
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,370
In their beds, Majesty.

446
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,041
Get them back to work without delay.

447
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,930
They're exhausted, sire.

448
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,810
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.

449
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,802
I need them back to work now.

450
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,610
It's the wee hours.

451
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,086
Aye.

452
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,801
Aye.

453
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,531
It is the wee hours.

454
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,690
So wake them up.

455
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,650
Sire?

456
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,804
So wake them up,
and get them back to work now!

457
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,089
We're running out of time! Go, now!

458
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,881
Aurora?

459
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,491
Come here.

460
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,286
Sit.

461
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,525
There's something I need to tell you.

462
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,485
What is it?

463
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,205
There is an evil in this world,

464
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,522
and I cannot keep you from it.

465
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,246
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

466
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,090
I can take care of myself.

467
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,165
I understand.

468
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,161
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.

469
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,611
When I'm older,

470
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,251
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

471
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,928
Then we can look after each other.

472
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,724
You don't have to wait until you're older.

473
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,166
You could live here now.

474
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,404
Then I Will.

475
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,682
I'll sleep in a tree
and eat berries and black nuts

476
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,411
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

477
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,762
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.

478
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,287
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.

479
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,684
Until tomorrow.

480
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,806
I'm so excited!

481
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,281
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

482
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,648
I need a life of my own.

483
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,889
No. I love you very much,

484
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,250
but it's time to say goodbye.

485
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,484
You've been very good to me,

486
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,524
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.

487
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,681
Hello.

488
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,328
I'm sorry to bother you,

489
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,000
but I'm on my way
to King Stefan's castle

490
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,930
and I've become hopelessly lost.

491
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,401
Can you help me?

492
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,926
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

493
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,045
Forgive me.

494
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,844
It's that way.

495
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,490
The castle.

496
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,680
What's your name?

497
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,440
It's Philip.

498
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,566
Hello, Philip.

499
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,331
What's yours?

500
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,891
Aurora.

501
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,244
Hello, Aurora.

502
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,087
Well, it was nice meeting you.

503
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,846
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

504
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,046
You're forgiven.

505
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,804
That's good.

506
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,211
I'd best be off, then.

507
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,245
Good bye.

508
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,762
Will you be back this way?

509
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,885
Nothing could stop me.

510
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,245
Then I'll see you soon.

511
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,411
Very soon.

512
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,643
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.

513
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,363
Stop doing that.

514
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,245
Well?

515
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,251
That boy's the answer.

516
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,089
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!

517
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,926
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

518
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,048
True love's kiss?

519
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,164
Have you not worked it out yet?

520
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,929
I cursed her that way
because there is no such thing.

521
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,408
Well, that might be how you feel,

522
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,601
but what about Aurora?

523
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,763
That boy could be her only chance.

524
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,760
It's her fate, anyway.

525
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,121
Go ahead.

526
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,727
Turn me into whatever you want.

527
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,926
A bird, a worm.

528
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,169
I don't care anymore.

529
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,002
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

530
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,209
We are not leaving tomorrow.

531
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,408
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

532
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,486
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.

533
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,804
No. He said on her birthday.

534
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,282
No. The day after her birthday.

535
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,970
- On.
- After.

536
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,286
- On.
- After.

537
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,763
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!

538
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,004
Stop it!

539
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,007
What?

540
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,525
How could you?

541
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,682
I need to talk to you about something.

542
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,161
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

543
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,329
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

544
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,963
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

545
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,126
Yes.

546
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,967
I'm leaving home.

547
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,040
See here, young lady.

548
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,200
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

549
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,520
with these two imbeciles...

550
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,801
So that you could ruin it on the last day.

551
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,326
We are taking you back
to your father with...

552
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,571
My father?

553
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,402
You told me my parents were dead.

554
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,210
I think you better come and sit down.

555
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,483
Fairy Godmother!

556
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,211
I'm here.

557
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,445
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?

558
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,760
Is it true?

559
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,006
It is.

560
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,403
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

561
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,285
I... I can't remember her name.

562
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,525
They said

563
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,726
it was...

564
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,605
Maleficent.

565
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,650
Is that you?

566
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,688
Are you Maleficent?

567
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,280
No!

568
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,325
Don't touch me.

569
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,724
You're the evil that's in the world.

570
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,451
It's you!

571
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,641
Find the boy!

572
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,449
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

573
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,683
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk right in.

574
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,285
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

575
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,563
We found this urchin at the gate.

576
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,248
She claims to be the princess.

577
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,246
Father.

578
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,409
It's me, Aurora!

579
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,641
You look just like your mother.

580
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,209
They brought you back a day too soon.

581
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,249
I told those three idiots!

582
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,563
Lock her up in her room.

583
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,166
Go.

584
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,486
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming.

585
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,210
It's so good to be small again!

586
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,330
Look at my feet!

587
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,801
I love my tiny little feet!

588
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,805
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora,

589
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,720
or the king will have our heads!

590
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,921
<i>Aurora.</i>

591
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,171
Wait!

592
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,805
Princess?

593
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,005
I'm looking for a girl.

594
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,250
Of course you are.

595
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,484
I need a horse.

596
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,644
<i>...into a sleep like death.</i>

597
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,489
<i>Aurora.</i>

598
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,201
Come on, Diaval!

599
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,490
<i>Aurora.</i>

600
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,364
Faster, Diaval, faster!

601
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,046
<i>She will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel</i>

602
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,648
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

603
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,088
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

604
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,491
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

605
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,280
It's done.

606
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,809
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

607
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,325
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

608
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,123
Then don't come. It's not your fight.

609
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,329
Thank you very much.

610
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,890
"I need you, Diaval.
I can't do this without you, Diaval."

611
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,605
I can hear you.

612
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,041
Look at her.

613
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,722
Look at what you've done.

614
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,364
She's only sleeping.

615
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,605
She's only sleeping, you say?

616
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,524
She's only sleeping.

617
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,610
She's only sleeping forever!

618
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,730
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!

619
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,850
True love does not exist.

620
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,721
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.

621
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,851
Mistress.

622
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,329
What are we going to do?

623
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,807
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

624
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,969
But we don't even know where to start.

625
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,686
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.

626
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,802
Pardon me.

627
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,327
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.

628
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,842
In King Stefan's castle.

629
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,810
This is where I'm meant to be.

630
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,563
Odd that I can't recall how I got here.

631
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,641
Why have you come?

632
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,564
My father sent me to see the King.

633
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,641
Who is your father?

634
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,200
King John of Ulstead.

635
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,644
A Prince!

636
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,165
Aurora.

637
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,169
He knows her.

638
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,205
Why is she sleeping?

639
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,682
She's trapped in an enchantment.

640
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,162
Isn't she beautiful?

641
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,886
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

642
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,003
Do you want to kiss her?

643
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,921
Very much.

644
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,731
Go on, then.

645
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,128
I wouldn't feel right about it.

646
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,850
I barely know her. We've only met once.

647
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,247
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?

648
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,930
Kiss her!

649
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,361
Go on.

650
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,520
An enchantment, you say?

651
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,770
Kiss her!

652
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,650
You didn't do it properly!

653
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,446
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

654
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,045
I was certain he was the one.

655
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,691
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.

656
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,126
I told you.

657
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,361
I will not ask your forgiveness

658
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,967
because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.

659
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,050
I was so lost

660
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,441
in hatred and revenge.

661
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,482
Sweet Aurora,

662
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,086
you stole what was left of my heart.

663
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,447
And now I have lost you forever.

664
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,530
I swear, no harm will come to you
as long as I live.

665
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:41,801
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.

666
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,882
Hello, Godmother.

667
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,209
Hello, beasty.

668
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,570
No truer love.

669
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,730
She's here, sire.

670
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,923
Are we going back to the Moors now?

671
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,009
If that is what you wish.

672
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,127
We've got her!

673
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,249
- Stop!
- Get back!

674
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,766
No!

675
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,005
Into a dragon.

676
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,520
To the other side.

677
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,484
Run, Aurora!

678
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,524
Get back! Hold it steady!

679
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,564
Pull to the left! Pull!

680
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,371
Hold the line!

681
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,126
Look out. Hold your line.

682
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,205
- Close in.
- Bring it down!

683
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,886
Enough!

684
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,644
How does it feel?

685
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,606
To be a fairy creature without wings

686
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,291
in a world where you don't belong?

687
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,526
Kill her!

688
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,286
Kill her!

689
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,770
<i>Shoot!</i>

690
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,246
Shoot her!

691
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,601
Take aim!

692
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,601
It's over.

693
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,364
<i>Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns</i>

694
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,807
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

695
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,766
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>

696
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,447
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>

697
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,761
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

698
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,131
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

699
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,647
<i>But that was not all.</i>

700
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,411
There she is. Hurry up. They're waiting.

701
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,246
Wait for me!

702
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,282
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,

703
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,804
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

704
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,765
Never mind.

705
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,003
Our kingdoms have been unified.

706
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,763
You have your queen.

707
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,085
<i>So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,</i>

708
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,244
<i>and I should know,</i>

709
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:26,848
<i>for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

710
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:05,286
<i>In the end, my kingdom was united
not by a hero or a villain,</i>

711
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,283
<i>as legend had predicted,</i>

712
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,365
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

713
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,961
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>
