1
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,312
<i>I grew up slowly</i>

2
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,858
<i>beside the tides and marshes
of a Carolina sea island.</i>

3
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:13,158
<i>We lived in a small white house</i>

4
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,744
<i>won by my great-great-grandfather,</i>

5
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,204
<i>Winston Shadrach Wingo...</i>

6
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,166
<i>in a horseshoe game.</i>

7
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,296
Last one around the tree is a ninny.

8
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:29,466
Joop, Joop, Joop! Come here.

9
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,426
Boys, boys! Careful now.

10
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,928
- I'll race you, Tom.
- Wait up, Luke.

11
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,431
<i>There are families
who live out their entire lives</i>

12
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,767
<i>without a single thing of interest
happening to them.</i>

13
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,810
Don't run so fast, Tom!

14
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:42,645
<i>I've always envied those families.</i>

15
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,773
Luke,
mind you don't torment that dog.

16
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,858
- It's my dog!
- It's my dog!

17
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,611
Tom, you're gonna step on him.
He's only a pup!

18
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,112
Here, Joop. Come here, Joop.

19
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,615
- Mom, did you see me run?
- Savannah, you want a bean?

20
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,450
- Come here, Joop!
- Yeah.

21
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,869
- Boys, you want a bean?
- Give one to the dog.

22
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,955
Quit squealing, Savannah.

23
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,874
You're next, Tom.

24
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,752
<i>The child of a beautiful woman,</i>

25
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:09,339
<i>I was also a shrimper's son
in love with the shape of boats.</i>

26
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,136
Luke, he's pushing me.

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,388
- I'm not pushing her.
- Quit pushing her.

28
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,310
You know that.

29
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,605
<i>As a small boy, I loved
to navigate my father's shrimp boat</i>

30
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,148
<i>between the sandbars.</i>

31
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:28,858
There's a rock pile up ahead.

32
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,904
<i>I suppose Henry Wingo
would have made a pretty good father,</i>

33
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,657
<i>if he hadn't been such a violent man.</i>

34
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,833
<i>From my mother
I inherited a love of language</i>

35
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>and an appreciation of nature.</i>

36
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:55,844
<i>She could turn a walk around the island
into a voyage of purest discovery.</i>

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,809
<i>As a child, I thought she was
the most extraordinary woman on Earth.</i>

38
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,730
<i>I wasn't the first son
to be wrong about his mother.</i>

39
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,496
- I am sick and tired of you...
- Leave me alone!

40
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,582
...never showing me
any respect in my own house!

41
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,500
- Wait for me!
- Listen to me, Lila.

42
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:31,462
<i>I don't know when my parents
began their war against each other.</i>

43
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,132
- You're running too fast for me.
- Move it, Tom!

44
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,886
<i>But I do know the only prisoners they took
were their children.</i>

45
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,430
Wait, you guys.
My shoes are falling off!

46
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,639
Keep up, Savannah.

47
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:45,018
<i>When my brother, sister and I
needed to escape, we developed a ritual.</i>

48
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,269
Okay, jump!

49
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,317
<i>We found a silent, soothing world
where there was no pain.</i>

50
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,738
<i>A world without mothers or fathers.</i>

51
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,993
<i>We would make a circle bound by flesh</i>

52
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:03,870
<i>and blood</i>

53
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,163
<i>and water.</i>

54
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:10,376
<i>And only when we felt our lungs betray us
would we rise toward the light...</i>

55
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:16,341
<i>and the fear of what lay in wait for us
above the surface.</i>

56
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,888
I held my breath longer than you.

57
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,182
That was fun. Let's do it again.

58
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,267
I did better than y'all.

59
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,311
No, you didn't!

60
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,981
<i>All this was a long time ago,</i>

61
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,901
<i>before I chose not to have a memory.</i>

62
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,778
Daddy!

63
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,281
I think something bit me!

64
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,534
Mr. Brighton,
are you selling dope to my girls again?

65
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,536
- Stop bugging us, Dad.
- Bye, girls.

66
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,456
- Bye, Mr. Brighton.
- Come on in. It's getting late!

67
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,041
It's a conch.

68
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,043
Bring him home.
I'll send him to college!

69
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,753
How do you know it's a boy?

70
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,672
Well, let's examine him.

71
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,549
Now, girls, have I ever told you
the facts of life?

72
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,802
Oh, no. Not this again.

73
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,387
Stay away from boys,

74
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,974
because they're all disgusting,
self-indulgent beasts

75
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,934
that pee on bushes and pick their noses.

76
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,937
- Gross, Dad!
- They're completely gross.

77
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,398
Anyway, I'm not gonna stay away from boys.

78
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,150
That's the spirit, Lucy.
Never do a thing your parents tell you.

79
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,777
Hey, Mom, look what I found!

80
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,737
Daddy, if you don't â€’

81
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,739
If you don't quit smoking,
you're gonna die.

82
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,741
That's what they told me at school.

83
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,493
Well, no more school for you.

84
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,412
Mom, Dad's smoking again.

85
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:31,165
Oh, no. Well, you know what to do
with that. Put it in the sink.

86
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,458
Give me a kiss.

87
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,294
I wanna play.

88
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,338
You look tired, Doctor.
I'll fix you a drink.

89
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:38,965
Oh, that would be so nice.

90
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,551
It's been one of those days.

91
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,636
Hey, honey, it's tough work being a saint.

92
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,850
- Sal, can you get it?
- Something smells good.

93
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,768
Hey, Dad. Come and play with us.

94
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:51,936
Later.

95
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,813
It's your mother.
She's calling from her car.

96
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,981
I'm not here.

97
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,733
Okay, Lila. She's coming over.

98
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:00,236
Why didn't you tell her
we were under quarantine?

99
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,904
She said she had to see you.

100
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,906
- No.
- Dad, they won't share.

101
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,742
Work it out, girls. Work it out.

102
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:08,453
She said it was urgent. She was crying.

103
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,788
I can't remember a day
when Lila wasn't crying.

104
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,124
Be nice to her, Tom.

105
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,668
I hate my mother, Sally.
I enjoy hating her.

106
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:17,962
Please don't kill
one of the few pleasures in my life.

107
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,797
Then can we talk about something else?

108
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,007
- Sure. What?
- Us.

109
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,093
I need a stiff drink
for that conversation.

110
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,636
- Listen.
- Girls?

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,971
Girls!

112
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,640
- What?
- Would anyone like to sit on Daddy's lap?

113
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,851
- No.
- There's money involved.

114
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,644
- Yeah.
- Okay.

115
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,813
Now, girls,
I'm gonna ask you a serious question,

116
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,648
and I want you to answer it
with brutal honesty.

117
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,858
Oh, brother. I know what the question is.

118
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,651
Who's the greatest human being
on this Earth?

119
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:41,736
Mama!

120
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,113
Mama? I've gotta develop
some new routines.

121
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,115
Come on, everybody. Pick up now.

122
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,493
Come on. Wash. It's bath time.
Gotta get ready.

123
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:51,037
We gotta pass inspection, troops.
Lila's coming over.

124
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,873
Lila, Lila, Lila.
Why can't we call her Grandma?

125
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,958
- You'll know when you're a grandma.
- I will?

126
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,419
Now, come on.
Pick up everything and get into that tub.

127
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,463
How does a little bouillabaisse
sound to you, Ms. Wingo?

128
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,507
Yuck!
Can't we ever have normal food?

129
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,218
Do you think we could talk seriously
for just a few minutes?

130
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,178
Not now, Sally. My mother's getting close.

131
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,180
Can't you tell? The air stopped moving.

132
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:13,351
Sometimes I think all you need
is just a good smack across your mouth.

133
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,811
Uh-oh. Here she is.

134
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,813
Sally, quick!
Tie this garlic around my neck.

135
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,439
Do we have to invite her for dinner?

136
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,359
She won't stay. You know that.

137
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,652
Then let's invite her.

138
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,072
- Lila.
- Hello, Sally, dear.

139
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,617
Those shrubs need watering.

140
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,077
Yeah. I'll have to do that.

141
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,580
You're looking well, Lila.

142
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:35,957
Don't be glib, Tom.

143
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,876
- Will you be having dinner with us?
- No. I can't stay long.

144
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,961
What a shame.

145
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,337
Where are my toys?

146
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,421
Where are the children?

147
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,841
- Okay, fine.
- They're taking baths. Why?

148
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,425
I have some bad news.

149
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,928
Don't tell me.
They canceled your American Express card.

150
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,264
Your sister tried to kill herself again.

151
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,891
You wanna make another joke?

152
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,936
Oh, my God, Lila. When?

153
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,980
I'm not sure.

154
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,732
She was in a coma when they found her.

155
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,155
How is she now?

156
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,073
She's alive, thank God.

157
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,701
I spoke to her psychiatrist.

158
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,578
Some Jewish woman in New York.

159
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,998
She wants one of us
to go up there right away.

160
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,207
I told her you'd go.

161
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,043
What are you saying, Lila?
If she's a shrink and a Jew, you can't go?

162
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,920
I didn't say that.

163
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,423
I'm just not entirely sure I'd be welcome.

164
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,968
You know Savannah.
She'd probably blame me.

165
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,179
My children blame me for everything.

166
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,222
Oh, do I detect
a note of guilt there, Mama?

167
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:36,184
Don't give me
that psychological horseshit.

168
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,894
Why don't you just come right out
and say it?

169
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,605
I'm responsible for all your problems.

170
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,148
Including your being out of a job.

171
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,941
Oh, let's hit
way below the belt now, Lila!

172
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,402
- Don't pretend you didn't start this.
- Come on. It's fun!

173
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,279
The fact is I just can't go right now.

174
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,281
It's your stepfather's birthday
this weekend.

175
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,074
Well, gee, Mama,
you know, I can't go either

176
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,202
because I gotta wash out
Sally's pantyhose.

177
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,870
I'm gonna take the clothes
to the cleaners.

178
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,414
Why don't you just get a job
as a stand-up comedian?

179
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,999
I'm sure it pays better than teaching did.

180
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,459
Which was far beneath me anyway.

181
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,753
- Wasn't that what you were gonna say?
- Beneath your abilities, yes.

182
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,547
- What do you know about my abilities?
- Talking to you is like chewing tinfoil.

183
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,466
- What do you mean chewing on tinfoil?
- It always has been.

184
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,884
Just stop it now, the both of you!

185
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,663
I'm sorry you're hurting.

186
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,874
You wanted to talk?

187
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,877
It can wait.

188
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,671
Let's walk.

189
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,099
Tell me what you're thinking.

190
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,854
I'm trying to calculate the exact moment
everything got so fucked up.

191
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:08,317
Uh, I'm also worried
the Braves are gonna finish last.

192
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,695
I don't feel like laughing.

193
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,322
Oh, come on, Sally. Come on.

194
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,452
Do you know that this is the first time
that you have touched me in weeks?

195
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,747
My life's a mess, Sally.

196
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,709
Our life's a mess, Tom.

197
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,338
Oh, look! There's the Big Dipper.

198
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:33,050
Oh, I don't give a shit
about the Big Dipper!

199
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,345
Damn it, I care about us.

200
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,598
I care about why you keep pushing me away.

201
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,393
I thought you said all this could wait,
sweetheart.

202
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,439
Wait? I've been waiting for two years,
Tom, ever since Luke died.

203
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,733
I know how you feel about him.

204
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,193
I just don't know
how you feel about me anymore.

205
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,155
Don't take it personally, Sal.

206
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,532
I don't know how I feel
about anything anymore.

207
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,495
God, you're pathetic.

208
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,672
Don't blame it on us.
Blame it on Con Ed!

209
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,841
Hey, come on.
Let's get this truck out of here.

210
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,344
Get the fucking truck out of here.

211
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,846
Come on, I'm in a hurry!

212
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,681
I've got a doctor's appointment.

213
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,684
Hey, lady! What are you honking at me for?
You're honking that horn...

214
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,145
<i>It was only my sister
who could force me</i>

215
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,773
<i>to come to this god-awful city.</i>

216
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,567
<i>This city that roars down on you.</i>

217
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,569
Christ, what the hell is going on?

218
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,695
<i>She loved it all.</i>

219
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:20,866
<i>The muggers, the winos,
the bag ladies, the wall-to-wall noise.</i>

220
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,410
Christ! Get me out of here.

221
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,538
<i>She loved it because
it had nothing to do with our childhood.</i>

222
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,872
Move it, for God's sake!

223
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,416
<i>Luke and I hated it</i>

224
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,668
<i>for exactly the same reason.</i>

225
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,175
You're â€’

226
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,015
- We're out of here.
- It's about time!

227
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,188
Jesus.

228
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,233
Oh.

229
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,782
Hello.

230
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,828
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.

231
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,580
You must be Tom, hmm?

232
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,540
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,418
Why don't you come in?

234
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,130
Hmm.

235
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,675
You can leave your things there.

236
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,018
Uh, am I supposed
to lie down on the couch,

237
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,978
or are we gonna make
polite chitchat first?

238
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,106
How about a cup of coffee?

239
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,317
Oh, we're gonna make
polite chitchat first.

240
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,235
Is that yes or no to the coffee?

241
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,528
It's a yes, ma'am.

242
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,158
Cream and sugar? And you don't have
to call me ma'am, you know.

243
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,994
Oh, that's my good home training,
and I'm a little nervous.

244
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,913
Cream, no sugar.

245
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,540
Why do you think you're nervous?

246
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,712
I get nervous every time my sister tries
to kill herself. It's a quirk of mine.

247
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,922
A quirk?

248
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,342
I'm sorry. I was being cynical.
It's a family trait.

249
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,636
Oh, I don't think Savannah's cynical.

250
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,012
No?

251
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,430
She's suicidal.

252
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,599
I wish she was cynical.

253
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,935
How is my sister?

254
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,937
She's out of physical danger,
but emotionally â€’

255
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,313
When can I see her?

256
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,398
You'll have to wait until tomorrow.

257
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,566
Why? Why can't I go now?

258
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,485
Because she's been very agitated today.

259
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,738
We're still trying to quiet her down,
and I think it'd be just too upsetting.

260
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,490
Wouldn't upset me.

261
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,283
No, but it might upset her.

262
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,414
How's your coffee? Is it hot enough?

263
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,250
It'll do.

264
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,088
In Savannah's poems...

265
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,508
are you the shrimper or the coach?

266
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,426
The coach.

267
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,054
Luke's the shrimper, or was.

268
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,684
And Savannah's last suicide attempt was
right after his death. Is that correct?

269
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,228
Yeah. She had a few bad days over it.

270
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,773
Were there other times?

271
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,651
Uh...

272
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,153
There might have been another time,
I don't know, when we were young,

273
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,030
but I'm not sure.

274
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,782
How are you getting paid?

275
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,619
- Why are you changing the subject?
- Because I don't like it much.

276
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,079
Is it okay if I smoke?

277
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,622
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

278
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,959
Jesus.

279
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,086
How well do you know your sister's poetry?

280
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,631
I said I was a coach, Lowenstein,
not an orangutan.

281
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,258
I was also an English teacher.

282
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,510
Of course I know her poetry.
She's my twin.

283
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,596
I know her stuff
a hell of a lot better than you do.

284
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,473
You don't like psychiatrists much, do you?

285
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,893
Why should I? What good do you people do?
You ask a lot of questions.

286
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,062
And I'm sick of this whole damn routine.

287
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,857
I'm sick of my sister's attraction
to razor blades!

288
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,776
And I'm sick of shrinks
who can't do a fucking thing to help her.

289
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,446
Well, I don't know
if I can help your sister either.

290
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,532
But I do know...

291
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:49,825
...I'm not gonna give up trying.

292
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,495
Why not? Maybe she just wants
to die too damn much, huh?

293
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,956
And that's okay with you?
You sound resigned to losing her.

294
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,459
Oh, hell no! It's not okay with me.

295
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,589
Yeah, but I am resigned.

296
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,051
Then I don't think
you can help me with Savannah.

297
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm sorry you had to come all this way.

298
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,810
What do you want from me?

299
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,021
Information.

300
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,484
You see, I've only been
Savannah's doctor for a few months.

301
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,820
And there's so much more
I need to know about her.

302
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,156
I need to hear
the stories of her childhood.

303
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,575
And she can't tell me because
there are whole portions of her life

304
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,328
that she's blocked out, blotted out.

305
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,499
So I need you to be her memory,
in a sense,

306
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,460
and, uh, fill in the missing details.

307
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,923
I've spent my life
trying to forget those missing details.

308
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,925
- I beg your pardon?
- I sa â€’

309
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,680
God, she's a pain in the ass.

310
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,142
What time tomorrow?

311
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,522
- I'll meet you at the hospital at noon.
- All right.

312
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,065
What's the matter? Do you have a headache?

313
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,608
Oh, a doozy.

314
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,860
You wouldn't have any morphine handy,
would you?

315
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,112
Morphine?

316
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,030
That's a joke, Lowenstein.

317
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,157
Huh.

318
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,664
Come on!
Get out of the way, kid.

319
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,332
If you don't move it, man,
you're gonna get hurt.

320
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,792
Screw you, man.

321
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,460
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.

322
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,214
- Get up here now. We gotta go.
- I don't want to go up now.

323
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,674
You gonna help me with the bags?

324
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,719
Are you out of your mind? You crazy?
I ain't helping you with no bags.

325
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,516
Come on. Move!
Get out of the way, huh?

326
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,976
Yo, taxi!

327
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,061
Don't yell at me!

328
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,702
Shit! Shit!

329
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,372
Move your ass an inch, motherfucker,
and you can kiss it goodbye!

330
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,042
Oh, hi, Eddie. Go ahead and shoot.
I've had a rotten day.

331
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,544
Tom!

332
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,463
You should have told me you were coming.

333
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,839
The gun, Eddie, the gun.

334
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,217
Oh, I'm sorry. Savannah and I
have been robbed twice this year.

335
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,219
They're leaping from fire escapes now.

336
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,054
One guy landed on my air conditioner.

337
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,015
I greased my windowsills.
That didn't help at all.

338
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,516
Oh, I love New York.

339
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,976
Oh, tell me about it.

340
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,103
- How's Andrew?
- Gone.

341
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,315
Said he needed space,
so he found a younger man with a duplex.

342
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,734
His loss, Eddie.

343
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,360
Bless you.

344
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,781
Savannah was an angel.
I practically lived over here.

345
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,741
So you're alone now, huh?

346
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,452
Well, unless I can tempt you

347
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,370
into crossing the line
while you're here, coach.

348
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,289
I got enough troubles, Eddie.

349
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,541
Actually, you look terrible, Tom.

350
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,835
I mean, you're not even cute anymore.

351
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,671
If that's your idea of seduction,
no wonder you're alone.

352
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,256
Well, it isn't easy.

353
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,009
Did you know Savannah
was seeing a psychiatrist again?

354
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,845
Of course. I recommended her.
She's a friend of mine.

355
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,108
It was a bitch washing it out.

356
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,361
You found her?

357
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,372
We've been giving her 50 milligrams
three times a day.

358
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,541
Mm-hmm. I'd bring it down to 25.

359
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:28,001
<i>Dr. Klein, extension 242.</i>

360
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,754
<i>Dr. Klein, extension 242.</i>

361
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:31,880
Don't expect too much.

362
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,182
Dr. Lowenstein, I need to see you.

363
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,433
Shh.

364
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,497
Hey, Savannah.

365
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,959
Hey, darling. It's me, Tom.

366
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,839
I have a cancellation,

367
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,634
so why don't you meet me
here at the hospital in 45 minutes, okay?

368
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,511
All right, I'm on the third floor.

369
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,764
What the hell is going on here?
Why is she strapped down like that?

370
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,475
I know you're upset, but her team
felt she had to be restrained.

371
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,020
Why? She has enough drugs in her
to anesthetize a whale!

372
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,106
- Her team decides what medication is â€’
- Oh, would you quit calling them her team?

373
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,400
Sounds like she's trying out
for the New York Giants.

374
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,110
What would you like me to call them?

375
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,321
Let's be creative. Call them assholes.

376
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,949
Well, let me tell you something
about those assholes, Mr. Wingo.

377
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,452
I'm very grateful to them
because they saved your sister's life.

378
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,995
Well, I don't like to see her
strapped down â€’

379
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,956
I don't care what you like!
She's still a threat to herself.

380
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,959
And there's no point to any of this
unless we can keep Savannah alive.

381
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,086
And I don't care
if it takes drugs or voodoo

382
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,131
or reading the goddamn tarot cards,
I want her alive.

383
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,507
Do you understand me?

384
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:04,097
You know, when I'm not picking straw
out of my teeth, I'm a very smart man.

385
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,936
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to sound condescending.

386
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,314
You're tough, Lowenstein.

387
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,232
And I'm starving.

388
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:16,944
Any interest in lunch?

389
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,947
Only if you let me pay.

390
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:23,033
Oh, I insist.

391
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,827
I wouldn't have objected
to LutÃ¨ce or Le Cirque.

392
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,829
- Here's your change.
- Their chili isn't as good.

393
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,289
- Thank you.
- Ah. Thank you.

394
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,375
Tell me something.

395
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,795
Why do you think your father
wouldn't answer my telegram?

396
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,881
Dad only likes good news.
Besides, the shrimp are running good.

397
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,716
And your mother?

398
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,678
Why didn't she come? I mean,
she was the one I spoke to, and, uh â€’

399
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:47,099
Priorities. My mother's too busy hiring
a caterer for my stepfather's birthday.

400
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,478
Do you always make jokes
in place of conversation?

401
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,563
It's the Southern way, ma'am.

402
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,316
Southern way?

403
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,735
My mother's own immortal phrase:

404
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,947
"When things get too painful,
we either avoid them or we laugh."

405
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,575
When do you cry,
according to the Southern way?

406
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,161
We don't.

407
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,082
Jesus! Even Sally makes
better chili than this.

408
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,834
I have a really good recipe,
if you're interested.

409
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,252
No, thanks. I never cook.

410
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,421
What the hell is it with you doctors?

411
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,298
- Tom.
- Yeah?

412
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,385
Does the word "Callanwolde"
mean anything to you?

413
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,390
No. Why?

414
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,853
It was something Savannah kept repeating
when she first came out of the coma.

415
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,731
Callanwolde, Callanwolde.

416
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:36,815
No?

417
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,192
I don't know.

418
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,238
I have to get back to the hospital.

419
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,740
It's late.

420
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,285
I can't see you tomorrow
till about 7:30, okay?

421
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,369
Okay.

422
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,204
Lowenstein!

423
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,832
What's your first name?

424
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,333
Why?

425
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,085
Why not?

426
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,631
It's just that, um,

427
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,009
my patients call me Dr. Lowenstein.

428
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,053
But I'm not your patient.

429
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,223
Susan.

430
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:15,270
Thank you, Doctor. I won't use
your name. I just wanted to know it.

431
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,564
Be on time.

432
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,270
Eight bucks a pound.

433
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,897
Eight bucks a pound for shrimp?

434
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,566
- Are they fresh?
- Yeah, they're fresh!

435
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,861
- They're today's. They're gorgeous.
- All right. I'll take a pound and a half.

436
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,571
Best of the best.
Let me get the scale, Tony.

437
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,701
<i>...the wear and tear may tell.</i>

438
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,788
<i>Black 28, Reynolds 34.</i>

439
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,123
<i>Shrimp Newburg?</i>

440
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,334
<i>For Christ's sake, Lila,
it's got wine in it!</i>

441
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,503
It's garbage!

442
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,463
It's elegant food, Henry.

443
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,258
And it's gonna get me
into the Colleton League.

444
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,469
That's a joke. What do you think
they got a Colleton League for?

445
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,513
To keep people like you out. Joop!

446
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,891
Why do you want to join anyway, Mama,
if they don't want you?

447
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,727
Of course they want me.
They just don't know it yet.

448
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,437
You see? Even the dog won't eat it.

449
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:44,276
Goddamn it! I work hard all day long
to come home and have to eat this shit?

450
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,527
I think it's good.

451
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,280
- Who asked you?
- Nobody.

452
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,198
Nobody.

453
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,742
Tip your head up, boy.

454
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,369
You ain't gonna cry, are you?

455
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,371
What did I tell you about crying?

456
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,874
What did I tell you
about crying in this house?

457
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,417
Put the hands in your lap.

458
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:01,960
Sit up straight!

459
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,171
Come on. Sit up straight.
You gonna cry now?

460
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,382
Savannah, go get this little girl
one of your dresses.

461
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,593
Why do you have to be so mean, Daddy?

462
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,928
Henry, why don't I get you another supper?

463
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,098
There's some leftover hash and rice.
I'll heat it up for you, all right?

464
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,224
Give me a hand here, Tom.

465
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,352
Yes, you go out in the kitchen
with the rest of the girls.

466
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,479
Why don't you bully
on somebody your own size?

467
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,398
And you? Huh, huh?

468
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,692
What, can't anyone take a joke
around here?

469
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,111
<i>This series will go down
as one of the greatest...</i>

470
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,196
<i>I'll help, Mama.</i>

471
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,032
- I want you to melt this butter, Savannah.
- Am I French?

472
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,701
And heat up this rice. You chop
that onion in fine little pieces, Tom.

473
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,785
I like American food!

474
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,955
<i>And the Yankees
are back out in front 3 to 2 in the...</i>

475
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,081
<i>I'm sorry, Mama.</i>

476
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,667
Sorry? There's nothing to be sorry for.

477
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,502
Marry into nothing,
you get nothing.

478
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,087
Add some pepper, Tom.

479
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,673
From 9:00 in the morning
to 5:00 at night...

480
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,675
Hand me that Worcestershire sauce
out of the cupboard.

481
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,137
...get a shrimp or two.

482
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,972
When I come home,
I want something I want to eat!

483
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,891
Your mouth is hanging open, child.

484
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,476
Come home,
expect me to eat something...

485
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,853
Nice and spicy.

486
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,855
<i>Shrimp Newburg?</i>

487
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,983
All I want is a good, plain American meal!

488
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,652
Here you go, darling.

489
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,577
Now this is food, Lila.

490
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,624
Eat up, children.

491
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,005
So your mother fed him dog food, huh?

492
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,092
Yeah. He even asked for a second helping.

493
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,678
Maybe that's where you got
your sense of humor, from your mother.

494
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,680
Oh, very funny, very funny.

495
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,974
She called today
very concerned about Savannah.

496
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,476
Don't believe a word she says.
She's a liar.

497
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,395
That's interesting.

498
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,105
She said you tell lies about her.

499
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,690
That figures.

500
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,026
You know, I saw Herbert Woodruff
come out of your office the other day.

501
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,695
He sure can play the fiddle.

502
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,321
You're changing the subject again.

503
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,948
What's wrong with him?

504
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,742
Just kidding.

505
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,120
Still, it's hard to believe that anybody

506
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,788
that makes that kind of money
has troubles.

507
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,040
Are you really that provincial?

508
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,501
Oh, hell, yes. So is Savannah.

509
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,963
When we were kids, the only way
we'd get off our island was by boat.

510
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,048
We grew up on a tidal plain.

511
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,467
A tidal plain? What does that mean?

512
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,055
Tides mean everything, Lowenstein.
They measure everything.

513
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,475
Moods, seasons, time to plant,

514
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,643
to fish,

515
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,520
to mate.

516
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,899
It's primitive, biological clocks
ticking all over the place.

517
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,277
Hmm.

518
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:34,738
Sounds like a nice way to live.

519
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,076
What else did she say, my mother?

520
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,956
She said that she was the one
who encouraged Savannah to become a poet.

521
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,000
Is that true?

522
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,585
Jesus Christ!

523
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,628
That woman has no shame.

524
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,131
You want to know
how she encouraged Savannah to write?

525
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,258
By burning the journals
she kept as a child.

526
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,426
Why would she burn them?

527
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,096
Because Savannah was being disloyal
writing about our hideous family.

528
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,515
What's hideous about your family?

529
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,560
Are you asking me to be disloyal?

530
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,437
If that's what it takes
to help Savannah, yes.

531
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,107
Aren't we about done?
What time is it?

532
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,693
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
We still have a few more minutes.

533
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,867
What did Savannah do
after your mother burned her journals?

534
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,286
Well, she took her finger
and she wrote in the sand.

535
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,829
And then she wrote in the air.

536
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,665
She began writing poetry
so mother wouldn't understand it.

537
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,460
So in a sense, your mother was right.
She did help to create a poet.

538
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,004
Oh, bullshit, Lowenstein.
She created a schizophrenic.

539
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,298
My mother should've raised cobras,
not children.

540
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,260
Can you tell me anything good
about your parents?

541
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:40,887
No.

542
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,847
Try.

543
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,147
Okay. They did two really good things:

544
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,358
Luke and Savannah.

545
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,235
Incredible people.

546
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,153
Passionate,

547
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,488
defiant,

548
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,656
not for sale.

549
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,200
What about you?

550
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:05,745
Oh, I was a courteous Southern boy
who did what he was told.

551
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,541
I was responsible and normal and dull.

552
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,295
I don't know what normal is,
and you're anything but dull.

553
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,423
Compared to them, I was.

554
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,845
Meanwhile, your sister's in the hospital,
and your brother's dead.

555
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,848
You must be doing something right.

556
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,277
You can go now.

557
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:38,820
Hmm?

558
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,239
Time's up.

559
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,200
Good night.

560
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:45,952
Night.

561
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,624
"Women and men,
both little and small,

562
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,461
cared for anyone not at all.

563
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,047
They sowed their isn't.
They reaped their same.

564
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,467
Sun, moon, stars, rain.

565
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:04,137
Children guessed, but only a few,

566
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,765
and down they forgot as up they grew."

567
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,727
<i>So this began a series
of confessional days,</i>

568
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,563
<i>when I spun out the history
of Savannah's past</i>

569
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,565
<i>in order to keep her alive.</i>

570
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,066
<i>By the second week,</i>

571
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,653
<i>I'd developed the first symptom
of the New York willies â€’</i>

572
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,822
<i>the guilt that every out-of-towner feels</i>

573
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,409
<i>if he's not improving
his mind every goddamn second.</i>

574
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,995
<i>I made a list of things I should do â€’</i>

575
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,707
<i>museums, plays,
run six miles in under 50 minutes,</i>

576
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,126
<i>see three foreign films
all at the same time.</i>

577
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,545
<i>Anything not to feel guilty.</i>

578
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,548
<i>Tom, how old was Savannah</i>

579
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,343
<i>when you first realized
something was wrong with her?</i>

580
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,220
<i>About seven or eight.</i>

581
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,597
<i>Anything specific happen?</i>

582
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,850
Well...

583
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,062
My mother had a baby at home.

584
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,272
It was stillborn.

585
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,194
She told us it died 'cause we were bad.

586
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,989
Anyway, we were gonna
bury it the next day,

587
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:09,118
so Dad wrapped it in some towels
and put it in the freezer.

588
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,081
That night,
I got up to get a drink of water...

589
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,377
and I saw Savannah sitting
in the rocking chair...

590
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,255
with the dead baby in her arms.

591
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,050
She was saying...

592
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,594
"You're the lucky one

593
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,097
because you don't have to live with us."

594
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,142
Did you say anything to her?

595
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,230
The next day I did,

596
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,107
but she didn't remember anything about it.

597
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,944
When I told her what happened,
all she said was,

598
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,488
"Why would anyone do
a crazy thing like that?"

599
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,614
Hmm.

600
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,409
So...

601
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,495
you were her memory even then.

602
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,626
I guess so.

603
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,505
Uh-huh.

604
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,981
Goddamn locks.

605
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:22,859
I'm coming, I'm coming!

606
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,115
Yo!

607
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,409
<i>Oh, what? What was that again?</i>

608
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,870
I'm learning to speak the language
of the natives here.

609
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,539
Hiya, Sally. How's it going down there?

610
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,292
Well, it's just sort of
blowing up a storm.

611
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,377
Oh, I got the girls' drawings.

612
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:44,255
- Did they get my letters?
<i>- Yep, they loved them.</i>

613
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,008
Oh, good. Did you get my letter?

614
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:48,760
Uh, Tom?

615
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:53,514
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to come home this weekend.

616
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,475
Why not?

617
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,520
Well, I'm not â€’ I'm just not sure
that I want to see you right now.

618
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,272
I, um...

619
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,941
I have a lot to figure out.

620
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,985
Uh-huh.

621
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,029
<i>What's the point, Tom?</i>

622
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,989
<i>I mean, let's face it.</i>

623
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,409
<i>We don't make each other
feelgood anymore.</i>

624
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:15,912
Right.

625
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,414
<i>Look, um...</i>

626
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,044
I didn't want to tell you this
on the telephone.

627
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:27,757
I wanted to tell you before you left,
but the way you left...

628
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,011
...there wasn't any time.

629
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,183
What did you want to tell me, Sally?

630
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,194
What's his name?

631
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,449
What's his name, Sally?

632
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,660
The man must have a name.

633
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,747
Jack Cleveland.

634
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,624
Oh, no.

635
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,917
Oh, no!

636
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,794
Jesus, Sally! Jesus!

637
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,546
Jack Cleveland?

638
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,840
You mean that aging, pompous hippie
from the hospital

639
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,550
<i>who still rides a motorcycle?</i>

640
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:13,386
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sally, why him?

641
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,679
<i>Why him?</i>

642
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,975
Because he knows how he feels about me.

643
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,482
Oh, Sally.

644
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,372
This is too difficult
to talk about over the phone.

645
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,959
Uh...

646
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,296
Just think about it carefully.

647
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,465
Okay?

648
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,759
I hardly think about anything else.

649
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,429
Good night, Tom.

650
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,306
Sally?

651
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,516
What?

652
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,854
Are you really in love?

653
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:07,940
I'm not sure.

654
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,986
I might even be doing this to hurt you.

655
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,281
I gotta go.

656
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,669
Dear Sally...

657
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:19,178
<i>I wish the words "I love you"
weren't so difficult for me.</i>

658
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:21,639
<i>I've missed you.</i>

659
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,474
<i>I miss touching you.</i>

660
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,103
<i>I don't know what keeps me
at such a distance.</i>

661
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,108
<i>I'm sorry I disappoint you, Sally.</i>

662
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,695
<i>But you're right to feel that way.</i>

663
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,282
<i>How else could you react to half a man?</i>

664
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,952
<i>How could you not be disappointed?</i>

665
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,040
<i>Hell, I seem to disappoint anyone
who tries to find the best in me.</i>

666
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:50,918
<i>Tom?</i>

667
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:53,379
Ma'am?

668
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,089
Come on in here.

669
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,806
Come on. Lie beside me. Come on.

670
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,990
You're the only Wingo
who's gonna amount to something.

671
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,994
Luke can't do it because he isn't smart.

672
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,539
Savannah can't do it
because she's just a girl.

673
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,917
- But Luke's smart, Mama.
- Not like you.

674
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:33,169
Or me.

675
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,381
Nobody knows this yet...

676
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,426
but I'm an amazing woman.

677
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,139
Do you believe that?

678
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,350
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,105
I'm not gonna die in a house like this.
I promise you that.

680
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,569
Something else, Tom.

681
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:02,615
I love you

682
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,659
more than I love any of them.

683
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,202
- But, Mama!
- I do.

684
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,245
I can't help it.

685
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,414
You're my favorite.

686
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,461
Now...

687
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,882
this is gonna be our little secret.

688
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,635
You keep a secret?

689
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,720
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

690
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,307
Can I go now?

691
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,188
Not till you tell me you love me.

692
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,484
I love you, Mama.

693
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:54,500
It took me 20 years
to tell Luke and Savannah about my secret.

694
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,004
And when I did,
they just fell on the floor howling.

695
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:00,923
You see, my mother took
each of them into that room

696
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,175
and told them exactly the same thing.

697
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,095
Hmm.

698
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,266
Why did you tell me that story?

699
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,852
To prove that Lila Wingo would â€’

700
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:19,442
Just to show why
Savannah could never trust her.

701
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,069
You mean why you could never trust her.

702
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:25,156
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
That's the wrong story.

703
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,117
Let's just skip it,
and I'll try to think of a better one.

704
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:31,370
What's bothering you?

705
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:36,208
Global warming, acid rain,
the national debt.

706
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:40,629
Oh, and my wife's having a goddamn affair
with a heart surgeon in South Carolina.

707
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,048
Hmm.

708
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,258
Jesus! I feel like such an idiot.

709
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,511
God, I never even knew it was going on.

710
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,638
Maybe you weren't paying attention.

711
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:51,140
Oh, bullshit!

712
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,600
Now, let's face it, Lowenstein.

713
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:54,685
Women are more devious than men.

714
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,896
Yeah, you're great at hiding things.

715
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,148
You keep secrets. You smile when you lie.

716
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,568
You know, you expect a man
to be a tower of strength.

717
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,905
And when it turns out he's got
a few weaknesses and some insecurities,

718
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,949
what do you do? You turn around,
and goddamn it, you betray him!

719
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,870
So you feel that your mother betrayed you?

720
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,456
I was talking about my wife!

721
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,459
Oh.

722
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:20,878
Oh, God, I hate this Freudian crap.

723
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,047
And it's not your job to listen
to my problems anyway.

724
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,590
And if you don't mind, I'd like to go.

725
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,383
You're free to leave anytime you want.

726
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:27,510
Good!

727
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,138
<i>Goddamn shrink.</i>

728
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,557
<i>Who was I kidding?</i>

729
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,769
<i>I was a champion at keeping secrets.</i>

730
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,938
<i>Better than any woman.</i>

731
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,900
<i>Until Susan Lowenstein came along.</i>

732
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,195
<i>A man who never talked...</i>

733
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:49,198
<i>now is doing nothing else.</i>

734
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:53,536
<i>Her questions making me
as dizzy as her perfume.</i>

735
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:11,720
Excuse me.

736
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,765
Would you like to dance?

737
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,018
Who, me?

738
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:19,270
Yes, you.

739
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,940
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

740
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,109
Come on. Just loosen up.

741
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,194
- No, I â€’
- Hey! Hands to yourself.

742
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,446
He's spoken for.

743
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,740
Tom, how's Savannah? When can I see her?

744
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:34,827
Well, I don't know, Eddie.
It's a little like talking to a fern.

745
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,704
Well, I'm glad she's improving.

746
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:37,872
Come on. Let's dance.

747
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,958
No, no. Come on. Give me a break, Eddie.
I'm a lousy dancer.

748
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,752
Oh, come on. Walk on the wild side.
You're in the big city.

749
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:45,504
Oh, no.

750
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,840
All right, whatever.

751
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:59,101
God, you are a lousy dancer. Go mingle.

752
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:02,354
Come on. Get in here.
Get into the party, into the party.

753
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,772
Hey, Eddie. Where are my chairs?

754
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,734
Well, I found four of them,
and I have a lead on another two.

755
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:09,612
Roberta, have I got a settee for you.

756
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,947
Don't laugh.

757
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,992
- You're laughing. You're laughing.
- I'm sorry.

758
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,161
I'm surprised to see you here.

759
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:18,871
Why? I like Eddie.

760
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,040
You know, I â€’

761
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,876
You really pissed me off today.

762
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,795
But you made me think about some things.

763
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,548
Well, don't make it a habit,
or I'll have to start charging you.

764
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:32,009
Oh! We do have a sense of humor.

765
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,553
I was beginning to think
you had it surgically removed.

766
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,058
You look mighty pretty tonight, ma'am.

767
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,393
Thank you.

768
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:43,229
Are you all right?

769
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,773
Oh, God, I'm great. I'm just great.

770
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,444
Now that I finished lying,
can I ask you to dance?

771
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,112
- Mm-mm.
- No?

772
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:53,197
No.

773
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,950
You'd be the first woman
I've danced with in New York City.

774
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,785
I'd rather not.

775
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,119
Come on, Lowenstein.

776
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:01,580
- Walk on the wild side.
- No, I â€’

777
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,749
Ah! It's a party. Come on.

778
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:08,963
Don't worry. I can't dance and make a pass
at the same time. I'd lose count.

779
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:10,464
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

780
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,141
- You came alone?
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:25,312
Yeah, it's funny. I never went
anywhere alone until I got married.

782
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,274
Well, that speaks well for matrimony.

783
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,109
No, it's just that, um...

784
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:32,903
my husband travels a lot.

785
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:34,405
Mm-hmm.

786
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:36,991
What does he do?

787
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:40,369
You know, it's late. I really should go.

788
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,623
- I'll take you home.
- No, no, it's okay. I'm fine, really.

789
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:47,376
I'm a Southerner, ma'am.
We take our ladies home.

790
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,420
Will you get me
a club soda, please?

791
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,839
How do you do it?

792
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,383
How do you listen
to people's sob stories all day?

793
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,801
Doesn't it depress you?

794
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:59,054
No, not if I think I can help them.

795
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:03,809
Anyway, you learn to separate
your patients' problems from your own.

796
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,895
Now yours I think I could handle.

797
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,564
Oh, yeah? Don't be so sure.

798
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:12,234
Tell me something. Um...

799
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,155
did you ever wanna write like Savannah?

800
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,784
You're changing the subject, Lowenstein.

801
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:22,202
- Am I?
- Mm-hmm.

802
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:24,747
- It's a technique I'm learning from you.
- Oh.

803
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,498
Oh, there he is again.

804
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:29,335
You see him? That guy is following me.

805
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,379
So you're a shrink to the stars, huh?

806
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,215
He's not my patient. He's my husband.

807
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,219
No kidding?

808
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:41,263
Herbert-fucking-Woodruff is your husband?

809
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:44,516
Mm-hmm.
Herbert Woodruff is my husband, yes.

810
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,934
How'd you meet him?

811
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,731
I saw him perform at, uh... Carnegie Hall.

812
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:53,442
I was 22 years old, and...

813
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,487
Oh! I had never heard anything like it.

814
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,946
I mean, that kind of...

815
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,658
passion, artistry, whatever you call it.

816
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,494
You know, just like Savannah's.

817
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:06,205
They have that gift to make people feel.

818
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:10,459
I fell in love with him instantly.

819
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,132
So you married him,

820
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,802
and then you lived happily
ever after, huh?

821
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:20,969
I married him.

822
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:24,890
What are you telling me, that mine isn't
the only screwed-up union on the planet?

823
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,350
I'm not telling you anything more.

824
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,269
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Now, no fair. I spill my guts to you.

825
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:31,063
I tell you my marriage is full of holes.

826
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:33,315
But when I ask you something,
you got nothing to say?

827
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:36,068
- I think it's your turn to give a little.
- No.

828
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,861
Oh, come on. Lowenstein, be human.

829
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:40,739
- Now, talk to me. Tell me about yourself.
- I can't. I can't.

830
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,908
God, why are there never any cabs
when you want them?

831
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,995
I'll tell you what. I'll ask you a few
simple questions, and you just answer.

832
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,831
- Simple?
- Yeah. It's very simple.

833
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:51,417
- Like, what's your father's name?
- Douglas.

834
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,920
- What's your favorite car?
- Um, I like those old Ford woodies.

835
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,423
Oh, good.
Who's the first boy you ever kissed?

836
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,343
Dick Berkowitz. He was very cute.

837
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:04,596
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you look in that suit?

838
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:08,267
What is this?
"Make Lowenstein Feel Better Day"?

839
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,768
And you got a great smile.

840
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:11,645
- You should smile more.
- Stop.

841
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,730
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Come on.

842
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:16,108
- Come here. Let me show you something.
- What?

843
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,860
Come here. Let me show you.

844
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:19,403
Right there.

845
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,697
- You're gonna show me a painting?
- No, you. Look at you.

846
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,116
- You, your face, your smile, your suit.
- Oh.

847
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,743
- I'm talking great stuff here, beautiful.
- Come on.

848
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,704
Okay. You convinced me.

849
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,372
Now, would you please get me a cab?

850
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:31,665
Mm-hmm.

851
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,047
Why don't you come up
for a minute? I'd like you to meet my son.

852
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:40,507
Sure. Okay.

853
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:44,219
Come on in.

854
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,931
Bernard?

855
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:52,603
Bernard.

856
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,813
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

857
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:55,898
How do you do?

858
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,233
Would you mind stepping out of the way?

859
00:46:58,984 --> 00:46:59,985
Oh, excuse me.

860
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,738
Mr. Wingo is a football coach, Bernard.

861
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,822
Oh, yeah?

862
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:08,452
Oh, Dad called from Vienna today.
Said to say hi to you when I saw you.

863
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:14,249
Did you practice this afternoon?

864
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,960
No, I've been too busy watching TV.

865
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:18,545
You're being rude, Bernard.

866
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:20,839
No, he's being a teenager.

867
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:22,925
I used to be one myself.

868
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,427
- No kidding?
- Mm-hmm.

869
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:28,931
Where are you from? Your accent's weird.

870
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:30,682
South Carolina.

871
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:32,518
Hmm.

872
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,688
Is this TV you're watching?

873
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,524
Would you please stop talking?
I'm trying to watch.

874
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,609
All right, it's late. Come on.

875
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,528
It's time for bed, Bernard. Let's go.

876
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,404
Turn down the TV and go to bed. Now.

877
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:45,781
I'll see you, Bernard.

878
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:49,868
God!

879
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:53,455
I'm sorry that he was so rude.

880
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:56,333
No, no, no.
You don't have to apologize, Lowenstein.

881
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,711
Teenagers, by definition,
are not fit for society.

882
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:01,296
That's true.

883
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,381
Um...

884
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:07,135
Bernard wants to play football. That's why
I brought you up here to meet him.

885
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:11,807
I thought that maybe you could coach him
a couple of days a week.

886
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:13,642
You see,

887
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:16,103
he never gets a chance to play
while his father's around.

888
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,272
So, uh, Herbert's on tour.

889
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:20,691
- I thought that maybe â€’
- Is this a job offer?

890
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:22,067
Yes.

891
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,319
Yes. And I would insist on paying you.

892
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,822
What would you consider a reasonable rate?

893
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,032
What are your rates?

894
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,829
I charge $150 an hour.

895
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,372
Fine, I'll take it.

896
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,251
You must be a very good coach.

897
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:46,258
Forget it, Lowenstein.
I'm not a charity case yet.

898
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,720
- Tell Bernard we'll start on Monday.
- Good.

899
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:51,680
- Good night.
- Good night.

900
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,988
First rule of thumb, Bernard.
Never be late.

901
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:09,740
I didn't want to come anyway, okay?

902
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,491
Well, your mother thinks
you wanna play ball.

903
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:12,743
Is there any truth to that?

904
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,202
Maybe, maybe not.

905
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:18,915
So where do you coach, Mr. Wingo?
Hillbilly country?

906
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:22,878
Oh, we're a little class-conscious,
are we?

907
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,005
Where do you go to school, Miss Porter's?

908
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,341
Phillips Exeter, smart-ass.

909
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,386
You didn't get to play last year, did you?

910
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:34,056
How'd you know?

911
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:38,518
Because any rich, snot-nosed punk
that would dare call his coach a smart-ass

912
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:40,812
wouldn't get to haul water,
let alone play.

913
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:44,775
With your attitude,
you belong in the bleachers, kid.

914
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,447
When you get ready to play football,
you get my number from your mother.

915
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,531
Catch.

916
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:45,127
Hey, you need help.

917
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,380
This is not an attractive look
for a middle-aged man.

918
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,048
When are you going to take me shopping?

919
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:53,135
Say, did you ever hear
of a woman named Renata Halpern?

920
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:54,219
No, who is she?

921
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:57,848
I don't know, but she writes good poems
about growing up Jewish in Brooklyn.

922
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,975
Are you sure she wasn't staying
with Savannah recently?

923
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,059
Not that I know of.

924
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:03,353
- Of course, I've been out of town a lot.
- All right.

925
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:05,188
Bloomingdale's on Saturday, big boy.

926
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:06,314
Okay.

927
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,195
Wait a minute. I have a map.

928
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:13,363
Coach Wingo?

929
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:16,199
Look, um...

930
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:18,201
You know, yesterday, I mean, I...

931
00:51:18,827 --> 00:51:19,995
You know, I...

932
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:23,415
- I â€’
- I accept your apology, Bernard.

933
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:26,418
I didn't get to play last year
'cause I never made the team.

934
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,420
I mean, they made fun of me.

935
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,923
If I coach you, Bernard,
I promise you they won't make fun of you.

936
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:33,300
But you gotta promise me something.

937
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:35,093
- What?
- You gotta shut up, Bernard.

938
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,553
Your mouth pisses me off.

939
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:37,679
Oh, yeah. Okay, okay.

940
00:51:37,763 --> 00:51:39,765
"Yes, sir" is the correct way
to address me.

941
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:42,601
Now, first thing we're gonna do
is follow certain forms and courtesies.

942
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:45,645
You'll do whatever I tell you to do,
and you'll do it with enthusiasm.

943
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:48,231
I'm gonna teach you to play football,
and I'm gonna teach you well.

944
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:49,900
I'm gonna run your ass off every day.

945
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:52,360
- Wait a sec. I have my violin lessons.
- Shut up, Bernard.

946
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:53,445
Yes, sir.

947
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:56,031
After I run you till you drop,
make you lift weights till you can't move,

948
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:59,117
make you tackle till your arms cramp,
something is gonna happen to you

949
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:01,369
that's never happened
in your miserable little life.

950
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:02,496
What's that, sir?

951
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:04,915
You're gonna be happy, kid.

952
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:07,209
Keep moving. Move 'em. Hit it!

953
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:10,420
Come on! Get up.

954
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:14,090
Drop that leg, roll. Drop this leg, roll.

955
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:16,551
That's it.
All right, let's see that smile.

956
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:18,595
Do it again with a smile.

957
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,097
Cross. Back. Cross.

958
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:24,476
That's it. Cross them over. Cross. Cross.

959
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,145
Bring this shoulder out.
Bring this shoulder â€’

960
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:29,397
Keep your eyes on the ball.
Concentrate, concentrate!

961
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,399
Come on, Bernard. Get your hands up.

962
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,068
Come on. Come on. Get it!

963
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,529
Look high! Turn around and run.

964
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:40,283
<i>You're the greatest person
in the whole world, Daddy.</i>

965
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:41,368
What's this?

966
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,870
I don't even get the pleasure
of asking the questions anymore?

967
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:46,331
- When you coming home, Daddy?
<i>- I'm coming home soon.</i>

968
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:49,292
Well, if you miss my birthday,
I'm gonna kill you.

969
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:51,628
Chandler, how could I miss your birthday?

970
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,506
I was there the day you pushed
your way into the world.

971
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:56,341
I want an alligator!

972
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,510
<i>Well, you go down to the marsh
and you get one.</i>

973
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,721
I want a stuffed alligator,
so he can sleep in bed with me.

974
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:04,474
Now, that's a dangerous habit
to get into, kiddo.

975
00:53:04,558 --> 00:53:05,934
- Is Mama there?
- <i>Mommy!</i>

976
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,811
Daddy wants to talk to you.

977
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,604
Okay.

978
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,273
- Hi.
<i>- Oh, hi, Sal.</i>

979
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,817
Listen, I really want to come home
for Chandler's birthday.

980
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,610
<i>Uh, it'd only be for a couple of days.</i>

981
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:18,029
We'd all be upset if you didn't come, Tom.

982
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:20,615
Oh, good. Well, thanks, Sally.

983
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,701
Okay. I'll talk to you. Bye.

984
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:24,286
All right. Bye-bye.

985
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:29,082
Set! Move!

986
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:33,211
Come on. Keep your balance.
Keep your balance. Keep your balance.

987
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:34,671
All right. Square. Square.

988
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:36,882
All right. Pop it. Pop it. Pop it.

989
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,341
- Like that?
- That's it.

990
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:39,926
See how you don't move?

991
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,761
Cross it over. Cross it over.
Cross it over!

992
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:43,388
Cross it over. Cross it over.
Cross it over!

993
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:45,265
Hut!

994
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,893
Pass it. Good.

995
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,478
Coach, what are you doing?
You got a broken cigarette.

996
00:53:50,562 --> 00:53:51,813
You gonna take my cigarette away?

997
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,024
<i>So this became my routine:</i>

998
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:55,984
<i>coaching Bernard in the morning,</i>

999
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,277
<i>and in the afternoon</i>

1000
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,238
<i>telling the Wingo family secrets
to his mother.</i>

1001
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,574
<i>And looking forward to telling them,</i>

1002
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:04,993
<i>or looking forward to seeing her.</i>

1003
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:08,371
It's as if Savannah
has some kind of a,

1004
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,416
of a splinter, you know,
that she's neglected.

1005
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:13,835
And, um, it festers.

1006
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:17,714
It festers inside you until you,
until you get it out.

1007
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,466
You know what I mean? Uh...

1008
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:22,218
And the stories you're telling me
are really helping her remember,

1009
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,721
and I â€’
I'm very proud of the work we're doing.

1010
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,057
Do you know what I mean?

1011
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:28,642
Huh?

1012
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,187
Time's up. Out.

1013
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,022
Lowenstein.

1014
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,607
- Here. Catch.
- Ah!

1015
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,858
- Throw me the ball.
- My nails.

1016
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:39,444
- Throw me the ball.
- Throw you the ball? Okay.

1017
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,781
Yay!

1018
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:46,201
Yeah. Yeah!

1019
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,161
Go! Go. Come On.

1020
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,788
Hit it! Good. Good.

1021
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:51,289
Move, move, move, move, move!

1022
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,460
Coach, what are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

1023
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,712
I'm not quitting, Bernard.

1024
00:54:57,796 --> 00:54:59,965
- You hear?
- Then I'll smoke.

1025
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:03,009
No, you're not smoking.
You're not smoking.

1026
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:05,303
- Then throw them out.
- All right. I will.

1027
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:09,015
- All of them.
- Oh, all right. All right!

1028
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,768
- Congratulations, Coach. How do you feel?
- I feel better already.

1029
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,026
You know, it's an art form
to hate New York properly.

1030
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:21,945
No, it's not. It's a clichÃ©.

1031
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,449
You're not such a dumb kid
after all, Bernard.

1032
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:27,575
Let's go to the bookstore.

1033
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:30,537
It's my daughter's birthday next weekend,
and she wants an alligator.

1034
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,331
There's a crocodile in Peter Pan.
Do you think she'll buy it?

1035
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:35,667
It's my mom's birthday next week too.

1036
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,545
- Oh, I bet you got her exactly nothing.
- Well...

1037
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,463
Come on.
We'll see if we can find her something.

1038
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,973
Shit! Shit.

1039
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,352
Who the hell is Renata Halpern,

1040
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,063
and what does she have
to do with my sister?

1041
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,522
Why don't you sit down and cool off?

1042
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:41,274
You've known about this the whole time,
haven't you?

1043
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,651
Tom, I find it difficult
conducting a session â€’

1044
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:46,613
Now, this is not a session, damn it!
I'm asking you a question.

1045
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:48,698
You're doing a shitty job of evading it.

1046
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:49,949
Tell me who wrote this book!

1047
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:51,910
- What's so disturbing about it?
- That's not the issue.

1048
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,536
The issue is why you didn't tell me.

1049
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,663
It wasn't my place to tell you.
Your sister specifically â€’

1050
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:57,582
You're a piece of work, Lowenstein.

1051
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,501
You know, I come in here
and I tell you everything,

1052
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:01,419
and you withhold
important information from me.

1053
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,588
- Maybe it's you who's withholding.
- This is not about me!

1054
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,173
Then why are you so upset?

1055
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:08,384
Because I don't like being lied to.
I don't like secrets.

1056
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:11,304
I could report you to the authorities,
have your goddamn license suspended.

1057
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,473
Tom, stop acting like a petulant child.

1058
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,266
You haven't answered
my question, Lowenstein.

1059
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,601
Tell me who wrote this book.

1060
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:18,353
- Why don't you tell me?
- Oh, I'll tell you.

1061
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,939
My sister wrote it.
It's all about my goddamn family.

1062
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:24,150
If my mother ever read it, she'd rip out
Savannah's pancreas with her teeth.

1063
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:26,986
Why? Why would she do that?
What are you all hiding?

1064
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,740
I don't answer any more questions
till you answer mine.

1065
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,494
Then why don't you sit down and listen?

1066
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:37,539
That is, if you're not too exhausted
by your temper tantrum.

1067
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,374
Mm-hmm.

1068
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,256
Oh, shit!

1069
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,300
The first few times
Savannah came to see me,

1070
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,261
she told me her name was Renata Halpern.

1071
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:53,263
Oh, Jesus.
She's even crazier than I thought.

1072
00:57:53,346 --> 00:57:54,764
Shut up or I won't continue.

1073
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,684
She told me her father was a furrier

1074
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:00,603
and that both parents
were survivors of the Holocaust.

1075
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:02,981
Now she couldn't fool me
about being Jewish,

1076
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:06,860
but what fascinated me was why
she chose to be the child of survivors.

1077
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:08,236
What was she trying to survive?

1078
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,737
What is she trying to survive?

1079
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,447
- Well, how the hell would I know?
- I think you do.

1080
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:13,950
Come on, Lowenstein. You're supposed
to be answering <i>my</i> questions.

1081
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,034
Why did she do it?

1082
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:17,829
Something about writing that book
made her want to become someone else.

1083
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,831
- And that was okay with you?
- It was not okay with me.

1084
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,749
I told her unless she resolved
her own problems,

1085
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,543
no one else she'd become
would have a chance.

1086
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:26,754
Is this what people pay you to do?
Turn them into someone else?

1087
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:28,339
You're not listening to me!
You haven't heard â€’

1088
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:29,924
Bullshit!
What do you think I'm doing here?

1089
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:32,969
- Complaining, avoiding, pointing fingers!
- Oh, fuck you, Lowenstein!

1090
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:35,513
Fuck you and Sigmund Freud
and my sister Renata Halpern.

1091
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:36,973
The whole thing makes me sick!

1092
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,641
The way you're reacting makes me sick.

1093
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:40,643
Well, how do you expect me to react, huh?

1094
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:42,270
What if I'd done the same thing
to your son?

1095
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,314
- It's not the same thing!
- Come on to South Carolina, Bernard!

1096
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:46,566
I'll change your name
and turn you into a Presbyterian!

1097
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:50,028
It's quite different, Mr. Wingo.
My son didn't try to kill himself.

1098
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:52,405
Oh, give him time, Lowenstein.
Give him time.

1099
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,740
You son of a bitch!

1100
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:59,412
- Oh, my God. I'll go get you some ice.
- Oh.

1101
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:00,663
Oh, Jesus.

1102
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:03,666
Oh, I see a big malpractice suit
coming out of this, Doctor.

1103
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,251
I am so embarrassed.

1104
00:59:05,335 --> 00:59:08,671
What a day.

1105
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:10,340
I get dropped by a dictionary,

1106
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:13,176
and I find out
my sister's become a Brooklyn Jew.

1107
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,552
Here, here, here.

1108
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:17,096
Oh, I don't need that. I'd rather
act like a man and bleed to death.

1109
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,390
- Just be quiet and take it.
- Oh!

1110
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:20,558
Oh.

1111
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:23,311
After you've stopped bleeding,
I'd like to take you to dinner.

1112
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:26,314
No chili today, Doctor.
This time it's gonna cost you.

1113
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,319
This is therapy, huh?

1114
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,321
Yeah. Pretty bloody, isn't it?

1115
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,114
Yeah.

1116
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:37,367
I still can't believe I did that to you.

1117
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,245
Face it, Lowenstein.
I bring out the animal in you.

1118
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:41,913
Hmm.

1119
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,499
- I owe you an apology.
- I accept.

1120
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,668
- That was a terrible thing to say.
- Yes, it was.

1121
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:48,378
I know it. Jesus.

1122
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:49,837
Thank you for accepting.

1123
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:53,466
- Would you like to order now?
- Um, we would like to order now.

1124
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,803
Do you want me to order for you?
I eat here all the time.

1125
00:59:56,886 --> 01:00:00,098
How am I supposed to trust a woman
to order for me who can't even cook?

1126
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:02,517
Just because I don't know how to cook
doesn't mean I don't know how to eat.

1127
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,185
All right.
Go ahead, Lowenstein.

1128
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:06,104
I'll do anything
to make you happy tonight.

1129
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,647
Okay. Good.

1130
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,107
I think, um...

1131
01:00:10,066 --> 01:00:13,194
I think we'll start with the...

1132
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:14,279
Mm-hmm.

1133
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:16,364
And, um, for monsieur...

1134
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,745
And then we'll have the...

1135
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,790
Delicious.

1136
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:28,876
And for our main course...

1137
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,545
- The rabbit is superb.
<i>- Merci.</i>

1138
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:37,385
God, there's nothing sexier than
a beautiful woman ordering food in French.

1139
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,804
Why don't you read me the whole menu?

1140
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,307
Are you flirting with me, Tom?

1141
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,975
Yeah, I think I am.

1142
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:46,853
And I'd like you to find me attractive,
bloody nose and all.

1143
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,897
And I'd like to ask you
something about Savannah.

1144
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:51,399
God!

1145
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,192
- Don't you ever take a night off?
- No.

1146
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:55,445
You said you'd do anything
to make me happy.

1147
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:56,529
Just one thing.

1148
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,241
Savannah told me that her children's book
came out of a dream.

1149
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:01,659
More like a nightmare.

1150
01:01:01,743 --> 01:01:03,703
And there were images in it
that terrorized her,

1151
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:05,246
but she didn't know why.

1152
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,998
You know, like the three stray dogs.

1153
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,250
You've read the story now.
What do you think it means?

1154
01:01:09,334 --> 01:01:12,003
Lowenstein, you're incorrigible.

1155
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:14,339
I mean, here we are
at a wonderful restaurant,

1156
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:16,466
and you want me to interpret
my sister's dreams?

1157
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:19,427
You wanna interpret dreams? Do mine.

1158
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:22,263
I had a great one about you last night.

1159
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:25,975
You had a dream about me?

1160
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:27,560
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1161
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,812
- You wanna hear?
- I'm not sure.

1162
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:32,482
Don't worry. This one's G-rated.

1163
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:34,734
- This one?
- Uh-huh.

1164
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:36,611
Tell me.

1165
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:41,282
There was a blinding snowstorm
right here in New York City.

1166
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:44,786
I went out for a walk, and I ran into you.

1167
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:48,039
We decided to go to the Rainbow Room.

1168
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,959
No one was there.
So we started to slow dance.

1169
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:56,130
What do you think it means?

1170
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,886
- You said it was a snowstorm?
- Mm-hmm.

1171
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:03,554
Blinding snowstorm?

1172
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:07,433
Maybe there's something
you're afraid to see.

1173
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:10,436
Maybe I wanna get to know you better.

1174
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:13,147
Maybe you're trying to snow me.

1175
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,067
Maybe I have cold feet.

1176
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:21,489
Maybe you just miss winter.

1177
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:24,742
That's it! Get in position.

1178
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:26,702
Move those legs. Move 'em. Move 'em!

1179
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,163
That's it. Get in position.
Keep your head up.

1180
01:02:29,247 --> 01:02:31,290
All right. Come.

1181
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:32,458
Ah!

1182
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:35,378
Is â€’ Is that my son?

1183
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,422
- That was good.
- Is that you in there, Bernard?

1184
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:40,258
- Okay. Let's try it again.
- I don't think this was such a good idea.

1185
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:42,218
Stop being a Jewish mother, Lowenstein.

1186
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,512
I am a Jewish mother.
I even brought sandwiches.

1187
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,180
Oh, good. I'm starving.

1188
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:49,225
- I got delicious ones here.
- Come on, Bernard. Take a break.

1189
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:50,601
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1190
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,353
Great. I got one for you.

1191
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,314
Slave away in the kitchen
all day making those, Mom?

1192
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,484
No, I bought them like I usually do.
Would you like one?

1193
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,820
No, I'm not hungry.

1194
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,575
So can I watch you play?

1195
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:08,327
I mean,
I promise I won't be overprotective.

1196
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:10,121
I don't really feel like playing anymore.

1197
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:13,541
Come on. Let's toss
the ball around for a few minutes.

1198
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,170
Am I a trained seal?
I gotta do whatever she wants?

1199
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:19,755
Oh, you got it tough, kid. Come on.

1200
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:20,840
Let's lie in the grass

1201
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:23,843
and cry for all
the terrible misfortune in your life, huh?

1202
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:26,429
You know, you turn into, like, a real jerk
every time my mother's around.

1203
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:27,930
What are you trying to do, impress her?

1204
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:31,225
You're totally out of line, Bernard.
You're not mad at him. You're mad at me.

1205
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,228
Save that crap for your patients, Mom.

1206
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:41,611
He's right, you know.

1207
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:43,613
He's absolutely right.

1208
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:46,365
I â€’ I don't know how to talk to him.

1209
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,495
Maybe you should try a new approach.

1210
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:54,415
- Yeah? What's that?
- Laugh, Lowenstein. Laugh.

1211
01:03:54,499 --> 01:03:56,375
The Southern way? Hmm?

1212
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:58,878
Yeah. If that doesn't work,
then you bop him on the head.

1213
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,300
What do you think of me, Tom?

1214
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,388
Well, I think you have it made.

1215
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:11,682
I mean, you're rich.
You live like a queen.

1216
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:16,103
Your kid needs some work,
but overall you're in the top 1 %.

1217
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:17,939
You're lying.

1218
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:26,155
I think you're a very sad woman,
Lowenstein.

1219
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:31,285
I like it when you tell the truth.

1220
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:36,374
And I think you're the first friend
I've made in a long time.

1221
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,168
Come on. Let's go to the movies.

1222
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,254
- The movies?
- Yeah. Come on.

1223
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:46,801
Rare footage
from the Savannah Wingo archives.

1224
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,094
How wonderful.

1225
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,595
Where did you find this?

1226
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:52,473
I was snooping around and I found 'em.
You know, Savannah must've kept them.

1227
01:04:52,557 --> 01:04:54,517
- Wait, wait. Who's that, Luke?
- Yeah, that's Luke.

1228
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,477
He was always horsing around.

1229
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:58,396
Oh, here's our graduation.

1230
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:01,816
- What? From grade school, right?
- Yeah, right. Grade school.

1231
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,859
Did you always jump in
with your clothes on?

1232
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:06,904
Yes.
As a matter of fact, we did.

1233
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:09,907
- And that's your mother, Lila?
- Yeah, that's Miss Lila.

1234
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:12,493
Mm-hmm.
She was very pretty.

1235
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,078
She still is.

1236
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:19,000
- So who took these pictures?
- My father.

1237
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,585
You see, bought this camera one year.

1238
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,129
Thought he'd give up shrimping,
the only thing he was good at,

1239
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:24,589
and make a fortune in film.

1240
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:26,340
Don't ask me how.

1241
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:29,927
Savannah said that, um,
your father was always losing money.

1242
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:31,846
- Is that true?
- Oh, that's an understatement.

1243
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,515
Henry Wingo had the opposite
of the Midas touch.

1244
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,392
Everything he touched turned to shit.

1245
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:38,311
What is that? Tell me what that is.

1246
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:41,522
That is one of my father's
all-time cockamamie schemes.

1247
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:42,607
What?

1248
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,442
Well, you see,
he bought this gas station.

1249
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,736
He thought this tiger
would draw people by the thousands.

1250
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:48,779
- All it did is scare 'em the hell away.
- Uh-huh.

1251
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:52,116
The only one that wasn't afraid
of that animal was Luke.

1252
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:54,910
He fed him.

1253
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:57,038
Took care of him.

1254
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,626
He had a lot of courage.

1255
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:03,669
What about you?

1256
01:06:04,545 --> 01:06:07,590
I didn't need any. I had Luke.

1257
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,217
Oh, this is our island.

1258
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,054
The only place Dad ever really owned.

1259
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,182
At the time this was taken,
it was worthless.

1260
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,184
Not to Luke, though.

1261
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,313
To him, it was
the most precious place in the world.

1262
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,232
When he was older, he went to Vietnam.

1263
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,234
He came back a hero.

1264
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,655
Swore he'd never leave it again.

1265
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:33,616
He didn't.

1266
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:40,456
What happened?

1267
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:44,502
My mother got the island
in the divorce settlement.

1268
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:47,505
She immediately sold it
to the government for a lot of money.

1269
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,966
They wanted to put up a power plant.

1270
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:53,886
Luke went crazy. He made some threats.

1271
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:55,721
The government laughed.

1272
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:58,766
He blew up a construction site.

1273
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,394
They quit laughing.

1274
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,106
And then?

1275
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,110
He went on waging his own private war.

1276
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,362
Hurt some people.

1277
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,656
Savannah and I tried to stop him,

1278
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:15,449
but the government stopped him first.

1279
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:17,952
Shot him in the head. Bingo.

1280
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:22,581
Would you like a cold drink?
Maybe a beer, huh?

1281
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:26,460
How did you deal with his death?

1282
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,464
- I shut down like a broken motor.
- Hmm.

1283
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:33,008
And according to the Southern way,
still no tears?

1284
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:37,304
Oh, I cry sometimes, Lowenstein.

1285
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:40,683
I cry at weddings, at the Olympics â€’
I'm real big at the national anthem.

1286
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:42,101
But not over Luke?

1287
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,938
What the hell for?
It wouldn't bring him back.

1288
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:50,443
No, but it might bring you back.

1289
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:09,754
Thank you.

1290
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:26,103
- Hey there! Welcome back.
- Hi.

1291
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:28,564
Oh, gee. Dr. Wingo
had an emergency down at the hospital.

1292
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,899
Oh, that's all right, Megan.

1293
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:33,068
- Are the girls asleep?
- Uh, yes, sir. For a while now.

1294
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:36,489
- All right. You can go home now.
- Okay. I'll just get my things.

1295
01:08:58,385 --> 01:08:59,762
Hey, Coach.

1296
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,013
Oh. Hey, Sally.

1297
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:05,935
- How you doing?
- All right. Fine.

1298
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,858
What's the proper form
in a situation like this?

1299
01:09:12,942 --> 01:09:15,236
Do we talk? Do we fight?
Ignore the whole thing altogether?

1300
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,987
I don't know. I don't know.

1301
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:18,739
You want some juice?

1302
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:20,449
Yeah.

1303
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:26,413
How's Savannah, Tom?

1304
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:28,833
She's one day up,
and then it's one day down.

1305
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,794
Do you, um, like the psychiatrist,
or trust her?

1306
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:34,296
Oh, yeah.

1307
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,423
What â€’ What's her name again?

1308
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,426
Lowenstein.

1309
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:41,387
Do you want me to make a fire?

1310
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:43,347
I don't think so.

1311
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,140
It's 90 degrees outside.

1312
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,269
You've always been such a traditionalist.

1313
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,189
Jack Cleveland wants to marry me, Tom.

1314
01:09:57,653 --> 01:09:59,488
Do you need a letter of recommendation?

1315
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:02,408
That's not funny.

1316
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:04,702
Well, uh, considering my other options,

1317
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:08,247
I thought it was the kindest,
most restrained thing I could say.

1318
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,711
What do you wanna do?

1319
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,629
I don't know.

1320
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:23,804
Part of me just wants to pack up
and walk away from a life...

1321
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,057
that doesn't seem to work anymore.

1322
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:37,484
And part of me says that no life will work
if I can't make this one right.

1323
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:42,740
How can I help you, Sally?

1324
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,203
By trying to understand, I guess.

1325
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:51,749
Sally.

1326
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,419
I'm sorry I made you unsure of yourself.

1327
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,465
I can be
a closed, defensive son of a bitch.

1328
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:02,259
Sometimes.

1329
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:07,598
Only sometimes.

1330
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:23,155
You coming in?

1331
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:29,119
Oh, I'll sleep here.

1332
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:34,917
It'd be too â€’ too confusing.

1333
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:37,628
Yeah.

1334
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:42,383
- Sally?
- Yeah?

1335
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:46,178
Thanks for asking though.

1336
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:05,364
Daddy's home!

1337
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:07,074
Yay!

1338
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:09,493
Daddy?

1339
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:11,745
Daddy?

1340
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:13,789
Where are you, Daddy?

1341
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,000
- Dad?
- Hey, Daddy!

1342
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:20,963
Who are these squealing piglets
jumping on my chest?

1343
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:22,506
Ah, boy, I'm hungry.

1344
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:24,883
A little mustard and hot sauce
and you'd be perfect.

1345
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:27,261
- You can't catch me.
- Can't catch me either.

1346
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,554
All right, who missed me most?

1347
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:31,140
- Careful now, there's money involved.
- Me. Me!

1348
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:34,184
Get your deck shoes on. We're going out
on Grandpa's shrimp boat later.

1349
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:35,686
- Hi, Jenny.
- We're gonna see Grandpa.

1350
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:37,980
- You like that sweater I got you?
- Yeah, it's nice, Dad.

1351
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:39,064
Good.

1352
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:43,569
- Dad?
- Hmm?

1353
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:48,115
Are you and Mom
having a bad fight or something?

1354
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:51,493
No, honey. Everything's fine.

1355
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:53,787
Y'all don't fool me.

1356
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:01,879
Oh, boy.

1357
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:08,510
What am I gonna do
with all you smart women?

1358
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:11,847
Hmm?

1359
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:13,766
Come here. Give me a hug.

1360
01:13:16,894 --> 01:13:18,270
Oh, Jenny.

1361
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:21,899
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

1362
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:28,238
Chandler, come on in if you wanna help.

1363
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:29,865
- You too, Tom.
- Look at that toaster!

1364
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,076
Mommy,
I got a fishing rod from Grandpa!

1365
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,202
Oh, it's beautiful.

1366
01:13:33,285 --> 01:13:35,579
- Well, maybe this one's a little...
- Daddy, come here.

1367
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:36,830
Lucy did that one.

1368
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:38,999
- I did not.
- You did too.

1369
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,710
I want this â€’ I wanna decorate.

1370
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:45,130
Well, of course you can decorate.
That's your cake. You go on and decorate.

1371
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:46,840
You stop eating that icing, you.

1372
01:13:46,924 --> 01:13:49,343
- I want to do one.
- Well, okay but...

1373
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:50,636
<i>Henry?</i>

1374
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:54,098
<i>Come to the table. The children
are gonna blow out their candles.</i>

1375
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:56,100
Henry?

1376
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:58,685
- <i>...be a factor, it may not.</i>
- Did you hear me?

1377
01:13:59,812 --> 01:14:02,606
It's time to sing "Happy Birthday"
to Tom and Savannah.

1378
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:03,732
I'm watching TV.

1379
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,651
<i>It's a fly ball
out to right field...</i>

1380
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:08,320
You get over there and help your children
celebrate their birthday,

1381
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:09,488
for Christ's sake.

1382
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,948
- Come here, woman.
- Let go!

1383
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:14,368
- Don't you ever tell me what to do, Lila.
- You're hurting me.

1384
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,286
This is my house.
You're just a guest in it!

1385
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,622
- Now turn the TV back on.
- No.

1386
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:21,083
Please, Mama. It's all right!
Turn the TV back on.

1387
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,793
Let go of me!

1388
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:25,379
You're gonna turn that TV on.
I was watching that.

1389
01:14:25,796 --> 01:14:30,384
Lila, I'm sick and tired of you
never showing me any respect!

1390
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,388
TV's broken, you son of a bitch.

1391
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,890
Now you can watch your kids
blow out their candles.

1392
01:14:40,352 --> 01:14:41,728
Yay!

1393
01:14:41,812 --> 01:14:44,481
<i>- â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª
- â™ª Happy birthday to me â™ª</i>

1394
01:14:44,565 --> 01:14:47,776
<i>- â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª
- â™ª Happy birthday to me â™ª</i>

1395
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:52,197
<i>- â™ª Happy birthday, dear Chandler â™ª
- â™ª Happy birthday, dear me â™ª</i>

1396
01:14:52,281 --> 01:14:55,909
<i>- â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª
- â™ª Happy birthday to me â™ª</i>

1397
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:02,166
Come on, Grandpa.
Daddy's gonna open the net.

1398
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:04,126
I'm coming, birthday girl.

1399
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,628
All right, bring it up. Bring it up.

1400
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:09,131
Grandpa,
I brought the fishing rod you bought me.

1401
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,675
- Hold it. Okay, okay.
- It smells.

1402
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:13,385
Stand back.
He's getting ready to drop it.

1403
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:15,137
- Daddy, can I help?
- Wait, wait, wait.

1404
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,430
Oh, hurry up, Daddy.

1405
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,348
Dad, I don't know
if we got much shrimp.

1406
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:20,142
- Oh, look at that.
- Yay!

1407
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:24,855
The first thing you wanna do is
push these crabs overboard.

1408
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:29,610
- Why, Grandpa?
- They'll die in the sun and the heat.

1409
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:32,404
Keep your eye out
for stingrays and catfish.

1410
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,865
- It's a long way to the hospital.
- Look at that little squiggly.

1411
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:36,700
- Chandler?
- What, Grandpa?

1412
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:39,369
- I want you to do something for me.
- Oh, there's a flounder.

1413
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:41,997
Pick up a shrimp
and I want to see you head it.

1414
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,457
Oh, I can do that.

1415
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,584
Now, you put it with your thumb.

1416
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:46,710
- Is this right, Grandpa?
- Remember how â€’

1417
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:48,670
Ah, ah!
Watch, see if you can do it with one hand.

1418
01:15:48,754 --> 01:15:49,922
Yeah.

1419
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:52,090
You got a knack for this, huh?

1420
01:15:52,174 --> 01:15:55,385
Look, fetch me that crate over there,
will ya?

1421
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:57,804
For this good-for-nothing trash fish.

1422
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,890
- Grandpa told me to get it.
- No, he didn't. He told me.

1423
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:02,059
I'm gonna get it for Grandpa.

1424
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,188
They love you, Dad.

1425
01:16:14,488 --> 01:16:17,824
The Braves lost to the Dodgers
last night 3-7.

1426
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:24,206
Did you know that, Son?

1427
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:29,127
Yeah, I know that, Dad.

1428
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,133
Put it right down there.

1429
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:36,677
Can I be a shrimper
when I grow up?

1430
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,346
Yeah.
You can be a shrimper like me.

1431
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:47,688
Bye-bye, girls. I love you!

1432
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:48,772
All right.

1433
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:50,774
- Write!
- Bye!

1434
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,777
- How will you get to the airport?
- Don't worry, I'll get a cab.

1435
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,153
Bye!

1436
01:16:55,237 --> 01:16:57,864
We love you, Daddy! Bye, Dad.

1437
01:17:02,369 --> 01:17:05,956
You know, I never realized how much
I love this place till I went away.

1438
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,336
"My soul grazes like a lamb

1439
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,797
on the beauty of indrawn tides."

1440
01:17:14,923 --> 01:17:17,551
You remember that?
You wrote that to me in a letter once.

1441
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,053
I used to write damn good letters,
didn't I?

1442
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:24,933
You've met somebody in New York,
haven't you?

1443
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:30,397
I don't know.

1444
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:33,525
I know.

1445
01:18:06,183 --> 01:18:08,894
Now, you're gonna do like I said.

1446
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:10,771
You're gonna apologize to the Newburys.

1447
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:14,441
Todd Newbury insulted our family, Mama.
He called us cheap white trash.

1448
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:17,277
And then you proved him right
by waling him, you stupid cracker.

1449
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:23,533
Oh!

1450
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:25,911
Oh, isn't this a lovely view?

1451
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,454
I wanna go home.

1452
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,206
Hush up.

1453
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,834
Hello, Tom.

1454
01:18:33,377 --> 01:18:34,419
Hello, Reese.

1455
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:36,421
I'm here to see my mother.

1456
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,924
Come on in. She's expecting you.

1457
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:40,926
Why, thank you.

1458
01:18:41,009 --> 01:18:43,637
It is awful good of you to see us, Reese.

1459
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,930
Well, it's my pleasure.

1460
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:47,766
You looking mighty pretty today, Lila.
As usual.

1461
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:52,229
Why, I always say "The most successful
men are always the nicest."

1462
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:55,065
Lila,
if you just have a seat right here.

1463
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:56,149
Why, sure.

1464
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,235
Tom and I are gonna have a little talk
in my study.

1465
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:00,362
Go on!

1466
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:04,866
Tom.

1467
01:19:06,952 --> 01:19:08,829
It's Oriental carpet.

1468
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,499
From the Orient.

1469
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:18,672
Hmm.

1470
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:26,388
If you ever touch my son again,

1471
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:29,641
you're gonna be crab bait
all over this river, boy.

1472
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,520
A Wingo never touches a Newbury.

1473
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:37,023
And if you tell anybody I hit you,

1474
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:39,734
I'm gonna run your family
clean out of this town.

1475
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,362
Now get out of here.

1476
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,868
I think it's more humid
than in New York City.

1477
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:49,911
Hello, darling.

1478
01:19:50,745 --> 01:19:52,038
- Tom.
- Hello, Lila.

1479
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:55,959
Wealth becomes you, Mama.

1480
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:57,752
Hmm.

1481
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,964
You really got what you wanted,
didn't you?

1482
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:03,633
Don't start, please.

1483
01:20:06,178 --> 01:20:07,596
Tell me about Savannah.

1484
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,432
She still has a long way to go.

1485
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:14,686
And I cut out a whole slew of articles
on mental illness.

1486
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:17,564
I want you to give them
to her psychiatrist, do you hear?

1487
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,107
I will, Lila. I will.

1488
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,822
What kinds of things
are you telling Savannah's doctor?

1489
01:20:25,906 --> 01:20:27,574
Anything that might help her get better.

1490
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,372
Go on.
Drink your tea before the ice melts.

1491
01:20:34,915 --> 01:20:37,501
I'm gonna tell Dr. Lowenstein
about Callanwolde.

1492
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:43,006
I don't know what you're talking about.

1493
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:45,091
Oh, yeah, you do, Mama.

1494
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:47,135
Yeah, you do.

1495
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,724
You made a promise
never to speak about that.

1496
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:55,727
I expect you to keep that promise.

1497
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,270
Oh, we were kids, Mama.

1498
01:20:57,354 --> 01:21:00,857
It was a stupid promise, and I think
it'd help all of us if we talked about it.

1499
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:04,110
This is my life too. My life is private.
I wanna keep it private.

1500
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:06,571
Even at the expense of helping
your own daughter?

1501
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:07,781
Stop exaggerating.

1502
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:10,075
Oh, come on, Mama.
Don't make me feel bad about this.

1503
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:11,701
You know, I didn't even have to tell you.

1504
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:12,953
I don't wanna talk about this.

1505
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:15,413
Jesus Christ, Lila!
Now, that's always been the problem!

1506
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:17,082
You know what your problem is?

1507
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:18,625
You dwell too much on the past.

1508
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,377
I never look back.

1509
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,670
When I say goodbye to something,

1510
01:21:21,753 --> 01:21:24,422
I close the door
and I never think about it again.

1511
01:21:24,506 --> 01:21:25,507
How about Luke?

1512
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:27,926
What?

1513
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:32,305
Do you ever think about Luke?

1514
01:21:40,564 --> 01:21:42,107
Does he ever cross your mind?

1515
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:51,700
Who taught you to be so cruel?

1516
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:55,870
You did, Mama.

1517
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,540
You did.

1518
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:12,470
But you also taught me that even though
someone nearly destroys your life,

1519
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:14,472
you can still feel love for 'em.

1520
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:21,521
Is that supposed to warm a mother's heart?

1521
01:22:27,235 --> 01:22:29,154
You have to be patient with me, Lila.

1522
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:32,032
You've done a lot to piss me off.

1523
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,721
There's so much noise in New York.

1524
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,892
Sirens, horns, screaming.

1525
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:08,026
Cream, no sugar, right?

1526
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,195
Hmm?

1527
01:23:12,364 --> 01:23:13,698
Oh, yeah, thanks.

1528
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,168
I have something to tell you.

1529
01:23:27,962 --> 01:23:29,005
I know.

1530
01:23:35,053 --> 01:23:36,179
I don't know how.

1531
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:41,476
Just say it.

1532
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:48,650
It was raining that night.

1533
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,197
<i>Mama was teaching us to dance.</i>

1534
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,157
Come on, Tom, honey. Come dance!

1535
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:58,743
<i>It was one of the few times
I remember having fun.</i>

1536
01:23:58,827 --> 01:24:01,287
- Come on.
- Oh, Mom! I can't dance.

1537
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:02,997
Oh, what do you mean?
Of course you can.

1538
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,375
Okay, take hold of Savannah's hand.

1539
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:07,335
Savannah does it better than me.
Just dance with her.

1540
01:24:09,337 --> 01:24:10,547
Here you go. Turn around.

1541
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:13,425
- One, two, kick. There you go, Tom. Kick.
- Stop. Stop.

1542
01:24:13,508 --> 01:24:15,844
Here comes another turn now.
You ready? Here we go.

1543
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,011
Turn. That's it!

1544
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:19,055
I wonder who that is.

1545
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,932
That's it.

1546
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:27,105
Tom!

1547
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:28,732
Mama!

1548
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,865
They broke into our house.

1549
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:38,783
Three men.

1550
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:42,245
Mama cried, "Help us, Tom."

1551
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:45,915
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

1552
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:55,341
One of 'em raped Savannah.

1553
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:58,428
One of 'em raped my mother.

1554
01:25:03,558 --> 01:25:04,559
Oh.

1555
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:11,524
I guess that's not the answer
to all of Savannah's problems,

1556
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:13,860
but I thought you should know.

1557
01:25:14,778 --> 01:25:15,862
God, yes.

1558
01:25:18,907 --> 01:25:20,283
And what's Callanwolde?

1559
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,913
That's the prison they escaped from.

1560
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:33,046
Um...

1561
01:25:34,589 --> 01:25:36,424
How old was Savannah when this happened?

1562
01:25:39,219 --> 01:25:40,303
Thirteen.

1563
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:44,224
Mm-hmm.

1564
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:46,017
And, um...

1565
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:50,897
What were you doing
while this was going on?

1566
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,823
I don't know.

1567
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:03,159
You don't know?

1568
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:05,495
Maybe you ran for help?

1569
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:08,748
No.

1570
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,335
Why not?

1571
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,380
I don't know. I don't know.

1572
01:26:20,552 --> 01:26:21,719
Why do you think you didn't?

1573
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:23,888
Well...

1574
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,140
I don't know.

1575
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:28,101
Just 'cause.

1576
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:32,647
That's a child's answer, Tom.

1577
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:47,120
You said before that, um...

1578
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:50,540
three men came in.

1579
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,543
What happened to the third man?

1580
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:00,008
Tom?

1581
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:04,137
Where was he?

1582
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:07,557
Tom, help me!

1583
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:10,059
Mama!

1584
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:12,687
- Help me!
- Come on.

1585
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:13,771
Savannah!

1586
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:15,189
Ah! Stop it!

1587
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:23,156
Tom?

1588
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:26,159
It's okay.

1589
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:29,287
Tell me about him.

1590
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:44,719
He said,
"You move, I'll slit your throat."

1591
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:46,804
- Tom!
- You're hurting me.

1592
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:48,056
<i>Raw meat.</i>

1593
01:27:48,723 --> 01:27:50,642
<i>He called me raw meat.</i>

1594
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:52,685
<i>"Nothing I like better than fresh...</i>

1595
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:55,229
- You're hurting me. Stop it!
<i>- ...raw meat."</i>

1596
01:28:02,904 --> 01:28:04,864
What was happening to me...

1597
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:11,704
was unimaginable.

1598
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:14,165
Literally.

1599
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,511
I didn't know it could happen to a boy.

1600
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,889
Tell me you like it.

1601
01:28:35,395 --> 01:28:37,146
All I wanted to do was die.

1602
01:28:42,527 --> 01:28:43,987
Especially when I saw Luke.

1603
01:28:48,241 --> 01:28:49,826
Tell me you like it.

1604
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:57,333
No. Don't!

1605
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:05,425
Damn it!

1606
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:22,442
Luke, two. Mama, one.

1607
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:23,860
While I did nothing.

1608
01:29:25,737 --> 01:29:27,238
There was nothing you could do.

1609
01:29:27,822 --> 01:29:29,782
You were just a young boy.

1610
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:30,950
You had no weapon.

1611
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:35,288
I'm surprised
you and Savannah survived it at all.

1612
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:41,377
Uh...

1613
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:46,382
What happened after? I mean...

1614
01:29:48,468 --> 01:29:51,095
How did your family deal with it?
Your father?

1615
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:55,183
Who said we told?

1616
01:29:57,185 --> 01:29:59,062
You â€’ You didn't tell?

1617
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:03,524
No one?

1618
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:08,279
No. You must have told the police or...

1619
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:14,035
Oh, Jesus Christ, Tom.

1620
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:17,622
Mama said, "It's over.

1621
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:20,958
Get these carcasses outside.

1622
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:24,670
Clean up this mess."

1623
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:28,466
<i>She was insane that night.</i>

1624
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:32,470
<i>"This did not happen.
This did not happen."</i>

1625
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:33,638
<i>She kept saying it.</i>

1626
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:36,808
<i>Told us the minute
we breathed a word about it</i>

1627
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:38,976
<i>was the minute
she stopped being our mother.</i>

1628
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:44,065
<i>Told us morning would come and everything
would look nicer in the sunlight.</i>

1629
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:49,612
And after we buried the bodies...

1630
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:52,907
I went in there to check on Savannah...

1631
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:56,953
to see how she was doing.

1632
01:30:58,579 --> 01:31:00,832
She was trying to do what Mama had said.

1633
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:04,836
Trying to act as if nothing had happened.

1634
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:08,131
Putting her hair up in rollers.

1635
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:12,593
- What'd you all do tonight?
<i>- Only her dress was on wrong side out.</i>

1636
01:31:12,677 --> 01:31:15,471
I'm busting my hump
while you're playing with a dimwit dog.

1637
01:31:15,555 --> 01:31:18,099
<i>When my father came home for dinner...</i>

1638
01:31:18,182 --> 01:31:19,183
Boys, pay attention.

1639
01:31:19,267 --> 01:31:21,644
<i>...we sat around and ate
as if nothing was wrong.</i>

1640
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,104
Eat up now.

1641
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:29,485
God help me.

1642
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:34,991
I think the silence
was worse than the rapes.

1643
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:42,915
Three days later,
Savannah tried to kill herself.

1644
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,052
She could keep quiet,
but she couldn't lie.

1645
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:03,769
<i>â™ª And that's what I like about the South â™ª</i>

1646
01:32:15,615 --> 01:32:17,158
Say something, Lowenstein.

1647
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:20,077
How do you feel?

1648
01:32:22,914 --> 01:32:24,999
Well, I feel, uh, okay.

1649
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:29,212
I mean, I thought I'd be
on the floor after telling you this,

1650
01:32:29,295 --> 01:32:32,715
but I â€’ I feel surprisingly all right.

1651
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:35,760
- You're sure?
- Oh, yeah.

1652
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:37,762
I mean...

1653
01:32:41,098 --> 01:32:42,183
What am I?

1654
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,229
I'm relieved.

1655
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:48,564
You know, the laundry's clean,

1656
01:32:48,648 --> 01:32:50,942
the ghost's out of the closet, and I'm â€’

1657
01:32:51,025 --> 01:32:53,277
You've really learned
how to cover your pain, haven't you?

1658
01:32:55,655 --> 01:32:57,657
You've done that all your life.

1659
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:03,746
That 13-year-old boy
is still in a lot of pain.

1660
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:12,213
Don't do this to me, Lowenstein.

1661
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:13,881
Don't do this to me.

1662
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,677
I can feel your pain, Tom.

1663
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:20,721
I feel it.

1664
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:24,100
Let yourself feel it.

1665
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:27,520
It takes courage to feel the pain, Tom.

1666
01:33:28,896 --> 01:33:30,481
You can do it. You can handle it.

1667
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:33,734
Don't be afraid.

1668
01:33:33,818 --> 01:33:35,361
It's okay.

1669
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:38,281
It's okay.

1670
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:40,783
It's okay.

1671
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:46,122
Oh, you've kept it locked up for so long.

1672
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:49,792
Just let it go.

1673
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:52,461
Let it go.

1674
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:56,841
You have so much to cry about, don't you?

1675
01:34:02,847 --> 01:34:03,931
It's okay.

1676
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,435
It's okay.

1677
01:34:08,519 --> 01:34:10,187
Yeah.

1678
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:11,355
Feel the pain.

1679
01:34:13,816 --> 01:34:14,817
Cry.

1680
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:16,402
Cry.

1681
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:18,070
Feel the pain.

1682
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,408
It's the only way to heal yourself.

1683
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:26,287
That's it.

1684
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:28,456
Just let it go.

1685
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:31,417
Let it go.

1686
01:34:33,586 --> 01:34:34,795
It's okay.

1687
01:34:56,359 --> 01:34:57,777
Oh, God.

1688
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,446
Oh, I'm too old for this shit.

1689
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,365
- Come on, Coach. Let's do it again.
- All right.

1690
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,993
Must be tough to get old, huh?
Out of shape. Past your prime.

1691
01:35:06,077 --> 01:35:07,370
- Come here.
- Huh?

1692
01:35:07,453 --> 01:35:10,581
Now, I don't mean anything personal
by this, Bernard,

1693
01:35:10,664 --> 01:35:13,125
but I'm gonna leave cleat marks
on your nose and cheeks

1694
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:14,210
and all over your face.

1695
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:16,253
Well, it felt great
putting you on your ass, Coach.

1696
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:18,089
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

1697
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:19,757
Set!

1698
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,050
Hut!

1699
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:23,052
Go! Come on. Come on. Come on!

1700
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:24,512
Oh!

1701
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:26,889
Oh.

1702
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:30,017
I can't believe I'm being outplayed
by a violinist.

1703
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:32,353
All right. Come on.
Give an old man a hand.

1704
01:35:32,436 --> 01:35:33,521
Ah!

1705
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,860
Now I'm gonna get you
if I can't teach you football.

1706
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:50,371
Jesus.

1707
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:55,084
Dad.

1708
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,845
So, this is how your mother
lets you spend the summer?

1709
01:36:05,928 --> 01:36:09,598
Professor Greenberg just called and said
you've skipped two lessons this week.

1710
01:36:09,682 --> 01:36:11,600
I don't like Greenberg. He's a creep.

1711
01:36:11,684 --> 01:36:12,977
He's strict.

1712
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,062
The great teachers usually are.

1713
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:17,940
I'm Tom Wingo, Mr. Woodruff,
Bernard's football coach.

1714
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,525
It's a pleasure, Mr. Wingo.

1715
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:21,527
Heard a lot about you.

1716
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,698
Why don't we call it quits for the day?
Go home and practice your fiddle.

1717
01:36:25,781 --> 01:36:27,783
Maybe we can work something out tomorrow.

1718
01:36:27,867 --> 01:36:29,034
Okay.

1719
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:31,328
I had no idea he was so strong.

1720
01:36:31,954 --> 01:36:33,497
He's a good football player.

1721
01:36:33,873 --> 01:36:36,917
But I'm not sure I want him
playing the violin with broken fingers.

1722
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:39,503
Well, he said you'd be worried about that.
He's pretty careful.

1723
01:36:39,962 --> 01:36:41,589
He's the one who should be worried.

1724
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:42,756
Well...

1725
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,801
I'm sorry to cut
your session short, Mr. Wingo,

1726
01:36:45,885 --> 01:36:49,054
but I've enrolled Bernard
in the last two weeks at Tanglewood.

1727
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,933
With a little discipline,
he might actually become a good musician.

1728
01:36:54,727 --> 01:36:56,061
You're the maestro.

1729
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,523
I'm glad you understand.

1730
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:05,321
Oh, um...

1731
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,948
Susan and I
are having a dinner party next Friday.

1732
01:37:09,283 --> 01:37:10,784
Why don't you join us?

1733
01:37:11,994 --> 01:37:13,579
Thanks. I'll look forward to it.

1734
01:37:32,097 --> 01:37:33,098
Hi.

1735
01:37:36,268 --> 01:37:37,269
How are you?

1736
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,313
Oh, I'm â€’ I'm okay.

1737
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:40,981
Good.

1738
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:43,275
How is she?

1739
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:46,779
Considering what she's been through
this week,

1740
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:48,364
I think she's doing very well.

1741
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:50,115
Can I see her?

1742
01:37:52,368 --> 01:37:53,744
I think she'd like that.

1743
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:09,093
How you doing, darling?

1744
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,805
Well...

1745
01:38:14,807 --> 01:38:16,225
I'm still here.

1746
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:20,646
So...

1747
01:38:21,397 --> 01:38:22,398
So...

1748
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:27,903
I don't know what to say.

1749
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:30,573
Then just let me hold you.

1750
01:38:31,532 --> 01:38:34,618
Tom, I'm so sorry
I put you through all this.

1751
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:36,537
No, no. You did me a favor.

1752
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:39,290
But just don't do it again.

1753
01:38:39,373 --> 01:38:42,501
I couldn't bear to think of a world
without you in it, sweetheart.

1754
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,297
Okay, let's go. Keep it moving.

1755
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:49,883
Hey, buddy, you! That's a no-parking zone,
so just move it out of here!

1756
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:52,511
Let's go! Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

1757
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:55,723
I hear it's pretty up in Tanglewood.

1758
01:38:55,806 --> 01:38:56,974
Who gives a shit?

1759
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:59,184
All right.
Let's go! Keep it moving.

1760
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:02,396
I wrote the coach
at your school, pal.

1761
01:39:03,105 --> 01:39:04,106
Why?

1762
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:07,109
I told him I was sending back
a hell of a ballplayer next year.

1763
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,402
You're a tough kid, Bernard.

1764
01:39:09,445 --> 01:39:10,446
I am?

1765
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:14,241
You took everything I dished out,
and you came back asking for more.

1766
01:39:15,743 --> 01:39:17,494
Well, you're the best coach I ever had.

1767
01:39:17,578 --> 01:39:20,539
Well, I'm the <i>only</i> coach you ever had.

1768
01:39:20,623 --> 01:39:21,707
No, I mean teacher.

1769
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,792
You're the best teacher I ever had,
Coach Wingo.

1770
01:39:24,293 --> 01:39:27,588
Thanks, Bernard. It's been a long time
since a student of mine said that.

1771
01:39:28,422 --> 01:39:29,506
Why did you quit?

1772
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:31,967
Well, I thought I should be doing
something better with my life.

1773
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:33,719
Like what?

1774
01:39:34,303 --> 01:39:36,472
Well, that's a good question.

1775
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:38,474
I'm not sure.

1776
01:39:39,058 --> 01:39:40,392
Well, can't you go back to it?

1777
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:42,227
I don't know if they'd even want me.

1778
01:39:42,311 --> 01:39:43,854
Maybe I could write a letter or something.

1779
01:39:43,937 --> 01:39:45,356
Just tell me where to send it.

1780
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:47,900
Thanks, Bernard. But I want you
to do something else for me.

1781
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:49,735
- What?
- Play the violin.

1782
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:51,278
Your father says you're pretty good.

1783
01:39:52,237 --> 01:39:53,947
- Here? Now?
- Sure. Why not?

1784
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:55,115
Cheer this joint up.

1785
01:39:56,075 --> 01:39:58,869
Well, okay.
But I mean, I'm a little embarrassed.

1786
01:39:58,952 --> 01:40:01,121
I mean, people might think
I want them to throw money.

1787
01:40:01,538 --> 01:40:04,541
Well, what's wrong
with a few extra bucks?

1788
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:06,960
Okay, well, um...

1789
01:40:07,461 --> 01:40:11,465
I guess I'll play this thing
I've kind of been working on.

1790
01:40:11,548 --> 01:40:12,549
All right.

1791
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:06,103
You know, if I could play the violin
like that, I'd never touch a football.

1792
01:41:06,812 --> 01:41:08,063
What's wrong with doing both?

1793
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:10,482
Absolutely nothing.

1794
01:41:10,566 --> 01:41:12,735
<i>Now boarding
through the gate at Track 29...</i>

1795
01:41:12,818 --> 01:41:14,194
Absolutely nothing.

1796
01:41:14,278 --> 01:41:15,696
Here you go. Put this on.

1797
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:18,115
You gotta hurry now.
You don't wanna miss your train.

1798
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:20,659
My father hates you, Coach Wingo.

1799
01:41:21,994 --> 01:41:23,370
Yeah, but he loves you.

1800
01:41:25,539 --> 01:41:26,623
Come here.

1801
01:41:27,332 --> 01:41:28,417
Goodbye, Bernard.

1802
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,753
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Me too.

1803
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:33,130
Bye.

1804
01:41:34,381 --> 01:41:37,217
- I'll write to you, okay?
- You better. You better!

1805
01:41:38,552 --> 01:41:39,762
And don't smoke!

1806
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:40,846
Oh, hey, Bernard!

1807
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,015
Hey!

1808
01:41:43,098 --> 01:41:44,600
You might be needing this!

1809
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:47,311
Bye.

1810
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,564
Now boarding, Track 29.

1811
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:53,817
All aboard!

1812
01:42:57,881 --> 01:42:59,758
I thought classical pianists

1813
01:42:59,842 --> 01:43:02,427
were supposed to be pinched
and anemic-looking.

1814
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:05,848
I'll sit you next to her
in case you wanna make a pass.

1815
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:08,725
No, thanks. She's not my type.

1816
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:10,018
Good.

1817
01:43:10,102 --> 01:43:11,436
Why do you say that?

1818
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,189
I think she's having an affair
with my husband.

1819
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:19,111
You've met everyone?

1820
01:43:19,194 --> 01:43:20,612
Yeah. I'm completely intimidated.

1821
01:43:20,696 --> 01:43:22,656
Madison Kingsley is
one of my favorite writers.

1822
01:43:22,739 --> 01:43:24,616
Talk to him.
I'm gonna check on dinner.

1823
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,451
...an American composer...

1824
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:27,536
Thank you very much.

1825
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:30,497
Tom! Oh, I'm delighted you're here.

1826
01:43:30,581 --> 01:43:33,542
Well, I'm delighted
I got to hear you play in person again.

1827
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:34,626
What? Again?

1828
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,796
Yes. I saw you at
the Charleston Music Festival last summer.

1829
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,048
Uh, Brahms' violin concerto.

1830
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:41,216
BartÃ³k.

1831
01:43:43,135 --> 01:43:45,429
Have you ever seen
a Stradivarius up close, Tom?

1832
01:43:45,512 --> 01:43:48,432
- This is the finest instrument ever made.
- Mm-hmm.

1833
01:43:48,515 --> 01:43:52,227
Everyone, I'm going to play something
in Mr. Wingo's honor.

1834
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:54,813
It's not that often
we have Southern guests, huh?

1835
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:56,815
What would you like to hear, Coach?

1836
01:43:56,899 --> 01:44:00,068
I'm afraid
I don't know many football songs.

1837
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:02,905
Yeah, well... Anything's fine with me.

1838
01:44:34,645 --> 01:44:38,273
Damn it all, Herb. That Mozart
sure cranked out some snappy tunes.

1839
01:44:42,194 --> 01:44:46,156
Could you do me a favor
and fix me a scotch and soda, please?

1840
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:49,368
Oh, yes, sir.

1841
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:50,535
Yes, sir.

1842
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:53,497
Who is he?

1843
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:55,707
That's a friend of Susan's.

1844
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:58,293
Some football coach.

1845
01:45:00,462 --> 01:45:01,755
Charming.

1846
01:45:05,634 --> 01:45:08,136
- Would you like some more wine?
- The food is wonderful.

1847
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,430
- Is it the same cook you had last year?
- Yes.

1848
01:45:10,514 --> 01:45:12,015
I'm glad you like it.

1849
01:45:12,432 --> 01:45:13,433
A minor artist.

1850
01:45:13,517 --> 01:45:16,353
How can you dismiss his work
as unimportant, Spencer?

1851
01:45:16,436 --> 01:45:18,689
It's hanging in the goddamn Metropolitan.

1852
01:45:18,772 --> 01:45:20,691
Well, Madison, so is toilet paper.

1853
01:45:20,774 --> 01:45:21,858
Tom!

1854
01:45:21,942 --> 01:45:23,568
Tom, you should talk to Madison.

1855
01:45:23,652 --> 01:45:26,071
He's a great admirer of Southern authors.

1856
01:45:26,154 --> 01:45:29,199
Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty.

1857
01:45:29,282 --> 01:45:31,618
Oh, I love
all those renegade Confederates.

1858
01:45:31,702 --> 01:45:33,829
You mean you love excess and eccentricity.

1859
01:45:33,912 --> 01:45:35,414
It's true.

1860
01:45:35,497 --> 01:45:37,499
They're all mad as hatters, aren't they?

1861
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:40,669
I suppose you know a few things
about madness, Tom.

1862
01:45:42,963 --> 01:45:43,964
A bit.

1863
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:48,218
Tom's sister is the poet Savannah Wingo,
Madison. Are you familiar with her work?

1864
01:45:48,301 --> 01:45:50,012
Yes. She's good.

1865
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:51,763
Very good.

1866
01:45:52,806 --> 01:45:54,141
She's a patient of Susan's.

1867
01:45:54,224 --> 01:45:56,393
I don't think that's appropriate.

1868
01:45:56,476 --> 01:45:57,894
Darling,

1869
01:45:57,978 --> 01:46:01,440
everyone knows you're the great
psychic healer of the literary community.

1870
01:46:01,523 --> 01:46:03,567
I'm surprised you don't get
a share of your authors' royalties.

1871
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,152
I'm sorry.

1872
01:46:05,235 --> 01:46:06,820
What have you been drinking, Herbert?

1873
01:46:06,903 --> 01:46:08,989
Oh, you should ask Tom. He poured it.

1874
01:46:09,614 --> 01:46:11,616
You weren't trying to poison me, were you?

1875
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,452
Not intentionally.

1876
01:46:13,535 --> 01:46:15,871
But you know
how the subconscious mind works.

1877
01:46:17,497 --> 01:46:19,541
I like you, Tom.

1878
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,753
I like your feistiness,
your Tara-like pride.

1879
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:24,629
You promised you wouldn't do this.

1880
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:27,215
You're right, Susan.
I shouldn't be picking on Tom.

1881
01:46:28,175 --> 01:46:29,259
I should be picking on you

1882
01:46:29,342 --> 01:46:32,387
for turning my son into Quasimodo
in a football uniform.

1883
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:36,892
Susan, I can't believe you'd let Bernard
play a game that might hurt his hands.

1884
01:46:36,975 --> 01:46:38,852
And I can't believe you'd come to my house

1885
01:46:38,935 --> 01:46:41,271
when everyone knows
you're fucking my husband.

1886
01:46:41,897 --> 01:46:42,981
Hmm.

1887
01:46:50,155 --> 01:46:52,783
I think you owe Monique an apology, Susan.

1888
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:55,702
I think you owe me an apology,
you son of a bitch.

1889
01:46:56,787 --> 01:46:59,206
Darling, where's your sense of humor?

1890
01:47:00,999 --> 01:47:04,002
Madison, what's the name of this character
in your play, the new one?

1891
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:06,129
I'm calling him S.B.

1892
01:47:06,213 --> 01:47:09,466
And he's modeled after a character
sitting right at this table.

1893
01:47:09,966 --> 01:47:12,844
- Not me, I hope.
- Yoo-hoo, Herbert!

1894
01:47:12,928 --> 01:47:15,555
Southern boy's got ahold of your fiddle!

1895
01:47:15,639 --> 01:47:16,640
What'd he say?

1896
01:47:16,723 --> 01:47:18,850
What's going on?

1897
01:47:18,934 --> 01:47:21,812
Better hurry, now!
It's getting heavy!

1898
01:47:22,354 --> 01:47:24,856
Herbert, what's taking you so long?

1899
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:26,358
What do you think you're doing?

1900
01:47:27,275 --> 01:47:30,570
Darling, where's your sense of humor?

1901
01:47:31,196 --> 01:47:33,782
That Stradivarius is worth
over $1 million.

1902
01:47:33,865 --> 01:47:36,827
Well, if I drop it,
it won't be worth shit.

1903
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:38,411
Don't do it, Tom.

1904
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:40,956
Apologize to your wife, Herbert.

1905
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:42,374
You're bluffing.

1906
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:43,959
I may be.

1907
01:47:44,042 --> 01:47:46,837
But it's a powerful bluff,
isn't it, asshole?

1908
01:47:47,462 --> 01:47:48,672
I'm sorry, Susan!

1909
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,386
Sincerity becomes you, Herbie.

1910
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:56,471
Now apologize to me

1911
01:47:56,555 --> 01:47:59,349
for your unforgivable breach of etiquette
at the dinner table tonight,

1912
01:47:59,432 --> 01:48:01,643
you possum-breathed cocksucker.

1913
01:48:04,271 --> 01:48:05,981
I'm very sorry, Tom.

1914
01:48:09,276 --> 01:48:12,529
You all sure know how to give a party
up here in New York City.

1915
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:23,039
Yo!

1916
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:25,667
Tom!

1917
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:29,087
Tom, wait!

1918
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:36,761
Now I know why you always seem so sad.

1919
01:48:41,683 --> 01:48:43,351
Please take me with you.

1920
01:49:13,006 --> 01:49:15,634
Let me warn you.

1921
01:49:15,717 --> 01:49:18,637
The thought of falling in love
terrifies me.

1922
01:49:22,432 --> 01:49:23,808
Then let's just be friends.

1923
01:49:24,976 --> 01:49:26,978
Very good friends.

1924
01:50:23,785 --> 01:50:25,036
Lowenstein...

1925
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,663
Hmm?

1926
01:50:30,834 --> 01:50:32,627
I think I like adultery.

1927
01:50:35,964 --> 01:50:37,716
That's why they made it a sin.

1928
01:50:47,183 --> 01:50:49,102
Repent, sinners!

1929
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:51,313
Cast your lot with the Lord!

1930
01:50:52,814 --> 01:50:54,983
After last night,
I'm gonna need some repenting.

1931
01:50:55,066 --> 01:50:56,860
Oh, I'm in trouble.

1932
01:50:56,943 --> 01:50:58,111
What? What?

1933
01:50:58,194 --> 01:51:00,238
Tell me. Why are you in trouble?

1934
01:51:00,322 --> 01:51:03,283
I'm starting to like this city, Doctor.

1935
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:04,909
What made you change your mind?

1936
01:51:08,163 --> 01:51:09,164
You have to ask?

1937
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:11,416
I'm neurotic.
I need a lot of reassurance.

1938
01:51:11,499 --> 01:51:14,169
Lowenstein, you could make me
change my mind about anything.

1939
01:51:15,754 --> 01:51:17,839
Hi, Tom. Hot baked goods.

1940
01:51:18,882 --> 01:51:20,800
Did I interrupt something vile?

1941
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:23,303
Well, hello, Susan!

1942
01:51:23,386 --> 01:51:25,680
You look fabulous this morning.

1943
01:51:25,764 --> 01:51:27,640
I'm so glad you both got laid.

1944
01:51:28,183 --> 01:51:29,309
Hi, Eddie.

1945
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:31,936
Do you like a little butter
on your croissant, darling?

1946
01:51:35,315 --> 01:51:36,483
Ask him.

1947
01:51:42,614 --> 01:51:43,740
Guess what?

1948
01:51:43,823 --> 01:51:47,702
I spoke to Bernard today, and he asked me
to come visit him next weekend.

1949
01:51:47,786 --> 01:51:49,120
I couldn't believe it.

1950
01:51:49,204 --> 01:51:50,580
That's great. That's fantastic.

1951
01:51:50,663 --> 01:51:53,041
Oh, I'm so grateful to you, Tom Wingo.

1952
01:51:53,124 --> 01:51:55,835
Oh, it was nothing. Nothing.
Come on. Cut it out.

1953
01:51:55,919 --> 01:51:57,504
Look! This is the property.

1954
01:51:57,587 --> 01:51:59,881
It goes all the way around,
all the way over to there.

1955
01:51:59,964 --> 01:52:01,299
Isn't it beautiful?

1956
01:52:01,383 --> 01:52:03,259
Not as beautiful as you.

1957
01:52:03,343 --> 01:52:04,886
Oh, sweetheart.

1958
01:52:05,387 --> 01:52:07,472
This is it.
Herbert never liked it, you know.

1959
01:52:07,555 --> 01:52:09,474
It made him sneeze, this place.

1960
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:13,895
I miss the clean, fresh smell
of carbon monoxide myself.

1961
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:16,523
I can't believe
we're only an hour away from New York.

1962
01:52:16,606 --> 01:52:19,442
Well, South Carolina's not
the only state with trees, you know.

1963
01:52:19,526 --> 01:52:21,945
You know, in my next life
I wanna be you, Lowenstein.

1964
01:52:22,404 --> 01:52:24,697
I wanna make lots of money
off of crazy people,

1965
01:52:24,781 --> 01:52:26,491
have a fabulous penthouse in the city,

1966
01:52:26,574 --> 01:52:29,577
a great country house and a guy like me.

1967
01:52:29,661 --> 01:52:30,829
Aw.

1968
01:52:33,581 --> 01:52:35,750
- Come on. I wanna show you around.
- All right.

1969
01:52:37,794 --> 01:52:39,546
Look, isn't it pretty?

1970
01:52:41,548 --> 01:52:43,258
Darling, you just broke a dozen eggs.

1971
01:52:43,341 --> 01:52:44,968
Oh, I don't care.

1972
01:52:48,346 --> 01:52:50,432
You know what I thought
when I first saw you?

1973
01:52:50,515 --> 01:52:51,516
What?

1974
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:54,102
I thought, "Jesus, she hates me.

1975
01:52:54,185 --> 01:52:56,771
Why does she make me feel so damn stupid?"

1976
01:52:56,855 --> 01:52:58,690
What do you think now?

1977
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,650
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

1978
01:53:00,733 --> 01:53:04,571
I'm thinking, "Why does she make me
feel so damn good?"

1979
01:53:05,363 --> 01:53:06,781
Because she loves you.

1980
01:53:22,714 --> 01:53:25,550
Lowenstein. Lowenstein.

1981
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:30,472
Maybe I should be calling you Susan now.

1982
01:53:32,724 --> 01:53:35,643
No, I love the way you say Lowenstein.

1983
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,230
You know...

1984
01:53:39,314 --> 01:53:41,983
Before I met you, I was in a deep sleep.

1985
01:53:42,984 --> 01:53:44,486
And I didn't even know it.

1986
01:53:50,575 --> 01:53:51,951
I'm afraid.

1987
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:54,829
Of what, sweetheart?

1988
01:53:56,915 --> 01:53:59,334
What's gonna happen
when Sally wants you back?

1989
01:54:05,924 --> 01:54:07,675
She wants you back, you know.

1990
01:54:08,801 --> 01:54:10,929
What makes you so sure?

1991
01:54:12,263 --> 01:54:14,849
- I've sampled the merchandise.
- Oh.

1992
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,434
- Oh!
- Hmm.

1993
01:54:16,518 --> 01:54:18,311
Oh, my God!

1994
01:54:24,817 --> 01:54:26,277
Spread 'em wide.

1995
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:27,612
You dirty thing, you.

1996
01:54:27,695 --> 01:54:29,989
No, I'm not being dirty.
Spread 'em this way.

1997
01:54:30,073 --> 01:54:31,533
Now, you gotta tackle me.

1998
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:34,661
Go on, tackle.

1999
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,038
- Catch it.
- Oh.

2000
01:54:37,121 --> 01:54:38,915
Ready.

2001
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:43,670
Oh, no! Oh, no!

2002
01:54:43,753 --> 01:54:46,506
Oh. Oh!

2003
01:54:48,091 --> 01:54:50,260
- I'm too old for this game.
- Me too.

2004
01:54:51,219 --> 01:54:53,096
- This is the best part.
- Yeah.

2005
01:54:55,348 --> 01:54:57,934
If we stay together,
do I have to become Jewish?

2006
01:54:58,017 --> 01:55:00,311
Of course not.
Herbert's not Jewish.

2007
01:55:00,395 --> 01:55:02,730
Hey, I don't mind.
Everybody in my family's doing it.

2008
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:20,915
There's Luke up there somewhere.

2009
01:55:24,085 --> 01:55:26,004
You stupid asshole!

2010
01:55:31,634 --> 01:55:34,637
When I was a kid,
he seemed like a god to me.

2011
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,017
How do you see him now?

2012
01:55:42,145 --> 01:55:43,354
Like a man...

2013
01:55:44,564 --> 01:55:47,066
with limitations, like the rest of us.

2014
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:49,777
Except you, Lowenstein. You're perfect.

2015
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:53,364
- I am far from it.
- No.

2016
01:55:53,448 --> 01:55:54,907
Oh, I look back on my life

2017
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:59,037
and I realize
that I've been paralyzed for the last...

2018
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:01,873
God knows how many years.

2019
01:56:03,082 --> 01:56:05,752
I mean, how could I have stayed
in a marriage like that?

2020
01:56:05,835 --> 01:56:07,337
Well, you had a son.

2021
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:09,631
Oh, yeah.
There were reasons, but...

2022
01:56:10,673 --> 01:56:12,091
none of them good enough.

2023
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:14,969
I just...

2024
01:56:16,429 --> 01:56:18,014
I just never thought that...

2025
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:20,224
this was possible.

2026
01:56:23,186 --> 01:56:24,604
And now I...

2027
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:29,859
I wake up in the morning,
and I spend my whole day thinking,

2028
01:56:29,942 --> 01:56:32,236
"Isn't it nice just to feel good?"

2029
01:56:34,405 --> 01:56:36,741
I mean, I hear you
walk down the hall towards me...

2030
01:56:41,454 --> 01:56:43,122
I can't stop smiling.

2031
01:56:45,249 --> 01:56:46,918
I smile all the time.

2032
01:56:57,011 --> 01:56:58,971
I love you, Lowenstein.

2033
01:57:03,142 --> 01:57:06,479
Can we go back to the cabin
and make love all night?

2034
01:57:11,025 --> 01:57:14,195
You still have a lot to learn
about the outdoors.

2035
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:02,493
I'm glad you brought me here.

2036
01:58:03,953 --> 01:58:06,831
Hey, Lowenstein says
she's gonna let you go home soon.

2037
01:58:06,914 --> 01:58:08,499
Hmm. I think I'm ready.

2038
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,669
What about you? When are you going home?

2039
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:17,425
Well, I don't know.
Sally and I are having problems.

2040
01:58:17,508 --> 01:58:19,427
Oh, no. I'm sorry, Tom.

2041
01:58:20,011 --> 01:58:22,221
I thought I might stay up here
for a while.

2042
01:58:22,305 --> 01:58:23,723
You in New York?

2043
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:27,435
I can't imagine that.
You could never leave the South.

2044
01:58:27,518 --> 01:58:28,519
Well, you did.

2045
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:31,439
Yeah.
But I don't love it the way you do.

2046
01:58:59,550 --> 01:59:01,552
Come get me.
You have to go under the water.

2047
01:59:12,438 --> 01:59:13,523
Hello?

2048
01:59:14,857 --> 01:59:15,983
Oh, hi, Sally.

2049
01:59:19,654 --> 01:59:20,738
Uh-huh.

2050
02:01:04,508 --> 02:01:05,676
She called you.

2051
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:16,103
Well...

2052
02:01:18,856 --> 02:01:20,691
We knew this day would come, didn't we?

2053
02:01:21,567 --> 02:01:22,985
But you're never quite...

2054
02:01:24,111 --> 02:01:26,364
prepared for it.

2055
02:01:26,447 --> 02:01:29,617
Just hold me, please.
I feel like I'm dying.

2056
02:01:34,705 --> 02:01:37,041
One of the things
I love about you is that...

2057
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:41,045
you're the kind of guy
who'll always go back to his family.

2058
02:01:45,257 --> 02:01:46,342
Oh!

2059
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:51,430
I gotta find me a nice Jewish boy.
You guys are killing me.

2060
02:02:18,082 --> 02:02:20,251
You okay about going home?

2061
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,545
I think so.

2062
02:02:23,754 --> 02:02:24,755
Good.

2063
02:02:26,841 --> 02:02:29,635
I started a new book of poems.

2064
02:02:29,719 --> 02:02:30,928
Oh, good.

2065
02:02:31,012 --> 02:02:32,179
I'm calling it...

2066
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:34,765
<i>The Prince of Tides.</i>

2067
02:02:34,849 --> 02:02:38,227
And I dedicated it
to somebody very special.

2068
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:40,479
Oh, Luke would appreciate that, Savannah.

2069
02:02:41,605 --> 02:02:43,024
I dedicated it,

2070
02:02:43,691 --> 02:02:46,277
"To my brother Tom Wingo...

2071
02:02:47,236 --> 02:02:48,779
my memory."

2072
02:02:54,326 --> 02:02:56,078
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

2073
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:02,460
Oh, thank you.

2074
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:30,071
Lowenstein, why are you making it so hard?

2075
02:03:37,828 --> 02:03:39,330
You just love her more.

2076
02:03:40,623 --> 02:03:41,791
Admit it.

2077
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,421
No, Lowenstein.

2078
02:03:48,005 --> 02:03:49,590
Just longer.

2079
02:04:12,655 --> 02:04:16,951
<i>We spent our last few hours together
at the Rainbow Room...</i>

2080
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:22,123
<i>dancing a slow dance.</i>

2081
02:04:24,917 --> 02:04:26,752
<i>Just like in my dream.</i>

2082
02:04:30,005 --> 02:04:31,966
<i>I held her in my arms...</i>

2083
02:04:33,509 --> 02:04:36,887
<i>as I told her that it was her doing
that I could go back.</i>

2084
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:43,894
<i>Six weeks before,
I was ready to leave my wife, my kids.</i>

2085
02:04:45,437 --> 02:04:47,189
<i>I wanted out of everything.</i>

2086
02:04:49,984 --> 02:04:51,485
<i>But she changed that.</i>

2087
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:54,321
<i>She changed me.</i>

2088
02:04:55,906 --> 02:04:59,076
<i>For the first time,
I felt like I had something to give back</i>

2089
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,911
<i>to the women in my life.</i>

2090
02:05:03,247 --> 02:05:04,748
<i>They deserved that.</i>

2091
02:05:22,725 --> 02:05:24,226
Daddy!

2092
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:26,937
- Daddy's home!
- Hi, Daddy!

2093
02:05:27,438 --> 02:05:29,273
Daddy, did you bring me anything?

2094
02:05:29,356 --> 02:05:32,860
<i>So I returned to my Southern home
and my Southern life.</i>

2095
02:05:33,444 --> 02:05:35,779
<i>And it is in the presence
of my wife and children</i>

2096
02:05:35,863 --> 02:05:39,033
<i>that I acknowledge my life, my destiny.</i>

2097
02:05:40,492 --> 02:05:42,077
<i>I am a teacher,</i>

2098
02:05:42,161 --> 02:05:43,829
<i>a coach,</i>

2099
02:05:43,913 --> 02:05:45,414
<i>and a well-loved man.</i>

2100
02:05:46,457 --> 02:05:48,375
<i>And it is more than enough.</i>

2101
02:05:51,003 --> 02:05:54,423
<i>In New York, I learned that I needed
to love my mother and father</i>

2102
02:05:54,506 --> 02:05:57,384
<i>in all their flawed, outrageous humanity.</i>

2103
02:05:58,552 --> 02:06:02,264
<i>And in families,
there are no crimes beyond forgiveness.</i>

2104
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:07,978
<i>But it is the mystery of life
that sustains me now.</i>

2105
02:06:10,314 --> 02:06:11,899
<i>And I look to the north...</i>

2106
02:06:14,026 --> 02:06:18,280
<i>and I wish again that there were
two lives apportioned to every man...</i>

2107
02:06:19,323 --> 02:06:20,824
<i>and every woman.</i>

2108
02:06:23,327 --> 02:06:27,164
<i>At the end of every day,
I drive through the city of Charleston.</i>

2109
02:06:27,831 --> 02:06:30,668
<i>And as I cross the bridge
that'll take me home...</i>

2110
02:06:31,961 --> 02:06:34,505
<i>I feel the words building inside me.</i>

2111
02:06:36,632 --> 02:06:39,677
<i>I can't stop 'em
or tell you why I say 'em.</i>

2112
02:06:41,136 --> 02:06:43,347
<i>But as I reach the top of the bridge...</i>

2113
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:47,142
<i>these words come to me in a whisper.</i>

2114
02:06:48,686 --> 02:06:50,521
<i>I say them as prayer...</i>

2115
02:06:51,563 --> 02:06:52,898
<i>as regret...</i>

2116
02:06:53,941 --> 02:06:55,442
<i>as praise.</i>

2117
02:06:56,235 --> 02:06:57,361
<i>I say...</i>

2118
02:06:58,570 --> 02:07:00,197
<i>"Lowenstein."</i>

2119
02:07:01,031 --> 02:07:02,658
<i>"Lowenstein."</i>
