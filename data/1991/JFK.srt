1
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:57,968
January, 1961.

2
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:02,264
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
Farewell Address to the Nation.

3
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:07,727
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new...

4
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,272
...in the American experience.

5
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,982
The total influence...

6
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:14,734
...economic, political, even spiritual...

7
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,906
...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

8
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,201
We must guard against the acquisition...

9
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:27,080
...of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought...

10
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:29,916
...by the military-industrial complex.

11
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,044
We must never let the weight
of this combination...

12
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:36,006
...endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

13
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:39,009
November, 1960.

14
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,345
Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy
of Massachusetts...

15
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:46,057
...wins one of the narrowest election
victories in American history...

16
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,687
...over Vice President Richard Nixon
by a little more than 100,000 votes.

17
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:55,317
Alongside his beautiful
and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier...

18
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:59,154
...Kennedy is the symbol
of the new freedom of the 1960s...

19
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:02,616
...signifying change and upheaval
to the American public.

20
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:04,451
"All men are created equal. "

21
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:07,787
Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted...

22
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,290
...to the cause of freedom
around the world.

23
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,667
Today, the proudest boast is:

24
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,878
"Ich bin ein Berliner! "

25
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,717
He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...

26
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:24,054
...a war run by the CIA
and angry Cuban exiles.

27
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,973
Castro is a successful revolutionary...

28
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:30,477
...frightening to American business
interests in Latin America.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,022
This war culminates in the disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion...

30
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,024
...in April, 1961...

31
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:41,029
...when Kennedy refuses to provide
air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.

32
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:44,533
Kennedy takes public responsibility
for the failure.

33
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:47,494
He privately claims the CIA lied to him...

34
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:51,998
...and tried to manipulate him into ordering
an American invasion of Cuba.

35
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,794
In October, 1962...

36
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:59,005
...the world comes to the brink
of nuclear war...

37
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:01,007
...when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...

38
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,220
...after announcing the presence
of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...

39
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,514
...90 miles off American shores.

40
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:10,767
Soviet ships with more missiles
sail towards Cuba...

41
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:13,353
...but at the last moment they turn back.

42
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,730
The world breathes with relief.

43
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:19,985
In Washington, rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal...

44
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:22,153
...with Russian Premier Khrushchev...

45
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:26,658
...not to invade Cuba in return
for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.

46
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:30,453
Suspicions abound that Kennedy
is soft on communism.

47
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:35,542
Kennedy also finds himself embroiled
in Laos and Vietnam.

48
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,086
We've got our difficulties there.

49
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:41,173
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government...

50
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:45,010
...to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

51
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:49,014
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

52
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:50,891
Early that fateful summer...

53
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:54,519
...Kennedy speaks of his new vision
at the American University.

54
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,229
What kind of peace do I mean?

55
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:58,315
What kind of peace do we seek?

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,066
Not a Pax Americana...

57
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,904
...enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

58
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:08,158
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

59
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,619
Our most basic, common link...

60
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,163
...is that we all inhabit...

61
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,915
...this small planet.

62
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,167
We all breathe the same air.

63
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,961
We all cherish our children's futures.

64
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,214
And we are all mortal.

65
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,351
You fucking assholes!

66
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:38,897
Don't leave me here!

67
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,401
They've gone to Dallas.

68
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:45,153
Friday.

69
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,866
They're going to kill...

70
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,660
...Kennedy.

71
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,038
Call somebody.

72
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:57,582
Stop them.

73
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,798
These are serious fucking guys.

74
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:13,223
She's been high on something
since they brought her in.

75
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,558
Help!

76
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,434
Please!

77
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,301
Here is a bulletin from CBS News.

78
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,847
In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...

79
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,016
...at President Kennedy's motorcade
in downtown Dallas.

80
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,519
The first reports say
that President Kennedy...

81
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:25,355
...has been seriously wounded
by the shooting.

82
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:49,713
What's wrong?

83
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,466
The President's been shot.

84
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:55,886
In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

85
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:57,596
Oh, no!

86
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:01,558
How bad?

87
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:04,561
No word. They think it's in the head.

88
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:14,905
Napoleon's has a TV set.

89
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:20,327
Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally
also appeared to have been hit.

90
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:25,332
The President was rushed to Parkland
Memorial Hospital, four miles away.

91
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:29,920
We are told the bullet entered the base
of the throat and came out the back...

92
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:32,255
...but there is no confirmation.

93
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:36,801
Blood transfusions are being given.
A priest has administered the last rites.

94
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,431
There's still a chance.

95
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,643
Pull through, Jack.

96
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:45,810
From Dallas...

97
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,063
...the flash, apparently official:

98
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,106
President Kennedy died...

99
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,193
...at 1:00 p. m. Central Standard Time...

100
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,238
...2:00 Eastern Standard Time...

101
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:58,865
...some 38 minutes ago.

102
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:07,040
Vice President Johnson
has left the hospital.

103
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:11,086
Presumably he will take
the oath of office shortly...

104
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:15,006
...and become the 36th President
of the United States.

105
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:20,720
He did so much for this country,
for colored people. Why?

106
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,936
Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!

107
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,146
Shut the fuck up!

108
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,192
I'm ashamed to be an American today.

109
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,404
The President of the United States is dead.

110
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:43,034
I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert
of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.

111
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,953
He told me...

112
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,416
...President Kennedy has been given
the last rites.

113
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,501
Shortly after 12:30...

114
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,922
...near the park in downtown Dallas...

115
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,674
...the shots rang out.

116
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,177
The President is dead.

117
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:03,805
The bullets came up over our heads...

118
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:07,058
...from that fence up on the knoll.

119
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:09,686
I seen his face when it hit.

120
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:14,900
His ear blew off and he turned real white.

121
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:20,488
He flopped over on his stomach...

122
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,076
...with his foot sticking out.

123
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:31,333
None of us thought it could happen
in America or any place else.

124
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,836
All this blubbering over
that no-count son of a bitch!

125
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:38,632
They're bawling like they knew the man.
Makes me want to puke.

126
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:42,219
For God's sake, the President was shot.

127
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,179
A bullshit President!

128
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:47,849
Nobody's crying for the thousands
of Cubans...

129
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,937
...that bastard condemned to death
and torture at Bay of Pigs.

130
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,981
Goddamn peace treaties!

131
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:57,108
I heard shots from over there.

132
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,154
- I heard shots from over there.
- How many?

133
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:04,908
That's what happens
when you let the niggers vote.

134
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:08,954
They get together with the Jews
and the Catholics...

135
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,665
...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

136
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,417
Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.

137
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,836
Bullshit!

138
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,213
Here's to the New Frontier.

139
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,341
Camelot in smithereens.

140
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:24,344
I'll drink to that.

141
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:31,977
Dallas police have just announced...

142
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,190
...they have a suspect in the killing
of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit...

143
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:41,111
...who was shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff,
a Dallas suburb.

144
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,657
Police say there could be a tie-in
to the President's murder.

145
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,035
The suspect,
identified as a Lee Harvey Oswald...

146
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:52,455
...was arrested by more
than a dozen policemen...

147
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:56,251
...after a short scuffle at a movie theater
in Oak Cliff.

148
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,504
Officer Tippit was killed...

149
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,216
...by a revolver which was found
on Oswald.

150
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:06,678
Shoot the bastard!

151
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,181
Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!

152
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,519
I don't know what I am charged with...

153
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:17,147
...but I emphatically deny these charges.

154
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,943
The kid must've gone nuts, right?

155
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,697
I said, Oswald must've flipped.

156
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,032
Right?

157
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:31,578
Just did this crazy thing
before anybody could stop him.

158
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:34,498
I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.

159
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,833
What are you talking about?

160
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,252
Who'd have ever thought...

161
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:44,090
...that goofy Oswald kid would pull
a stunt like an assassination?

162
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:48,803
Goes to show you can never know
about some people. Am I right, Jack?

163
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:50,639
Am I right, Jack?

164
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,724
Well, bless my soul.

165
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,937
All these years,
I thought you were on my team.

166
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,272
Are you kidding?

167
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:02,734
I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

168
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:06,863
Your little red eyes have me wondering
about your loyalty.

169
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,165
Look at that, Martin.

170
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:22,712
Who's been going through my files?

171
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,258
You've been looking through my files,
you little weasel!

172
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,928
You're starting to get paranoid. Really!

173
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,181
You went through all my files!

174
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:34,975
You're a goddamn spy!

175
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:37,644
Why would I want to look
through your files?

176
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:40,814
I've seen enough here this summer
to write a book.

177
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:43,108
I always lock my files!

178
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,527
You're the only one here today.

179
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:48,488
What do you mean, you bastard?

180
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,157
You're going to write a book?

181
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:53,076
You know what I mean.

182
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:57,372
I've seen a lot of strange things here.

183
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,291
Strange people.

184
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,135
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

185
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,845
Not a goddamn thing!

186
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:14,598
The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

187
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:19,895
- Did you shoot the President?
- I didn't shoot anybody.

188
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:24,274
They have taken me in
because I have lived in the Soviet Union.

189
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,110
I'm just a patsy!

190
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:29,988
He sure looks like a creep.

191
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,784
I protested at that time I was not allowed
legal representation...

192
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:39,289
...during that very short and sweet hearing.

193
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:41,541
I really don't know...

194
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,502
...what this situation is about.

195
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:46,755
Nobody has told me anything
except that I am accused...

196
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,090
...of murdering a policeman.

197
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,842
I know nothing more than that.

198
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:54,638
I do request someone to come forward...

199
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:57,265
...to give me legal assistance.

200
00:14:57,432 --> 00:15:00,560
Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement
or whatever it's called?

201
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:03,021
It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

202
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:06,149
Why were you in Russia?
What happened to your eye?

203
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,152
He seems pretty cool
for a man under pressure.

204
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:10,987
A policeman hit me.

205
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,531
He gives me the willies.

206
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:15,700
Come on, sugarplums,
it's past your bedtimes.

207
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:20,247
Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.

208
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,252
A fine man.

209
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,922
After a stint in the Marines...

210
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:33,343
...he became fascinated by communism.
He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...

211
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:38,056
...and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro
and ultra left-wing causes.

212
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,309
He spent last summer in New Orleans
and was arrested...

213
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:44,062
...in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.

214
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:50,443
Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.

215
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:55,198
Matter of routine. Get on
this Oswald connection in New Orleans.

216
00:15:55,907 --> 00:16:00,162
Check out his record. Find any friends
or associates from last summer.

217
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,082
Let's meet with the investigators
day after tomorrow.

218
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,084
On Sunday?

219
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,752
Sunday. 11:00.

220
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,088
Thanks, Lou.

221
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:12,924
I would say that he is the killer...

222
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,803
...beyond a reasonable doubt
and to a moral certainty.

223
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,932
I thought a motorcycle had backfired.
I looked to my left.

224
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:23,268
A second shot hit him in the face.

225
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:28,356
The rifle, a cheap World War ll,
Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano...

226
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,942
...was ordered from
a Chicago mailing house...

227
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,196
...and shipped to Oswald's alias,
A. Hidell...

228
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:37,449
...at a post office box in March of 1963.

229
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:41,203
This same rifle was used
to assassinate the President.

230
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,205
That ties it up.

231
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:47,626
Another nut. Jesus Christ,
anybody can get a rifle in Texas!

232
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:52,380
As far as Oswald's associates,
one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.

233
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:55,800
Oswald was seen with him
several times last summer.

234
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:59,346
I know David. Strange character.

235
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,141
He's been in trouble before. He was
a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.

236
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:06,061
Got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident.

237
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:10,190
These photos were found yesterday
among Oswald's possessions...

238
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:14,361
...in the garage where Marina Oswald
and her children are living.

239
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:18,365
Somebody mentioned Ferrie
on that Texas trip. Find that out.

240
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:20,659
He no shoot anyone.

241
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,453
He good man. Good husband.

242
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:28,166
So it seems David Ferrie drove off
on Friday afternoon for Texas.

243
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,962
A source said he might have been
a getaway pilot for Oswald.

244
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:34,923
Hold your horses.

245
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,675
What kind of source?

246
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,010
The anonymous kind, Chief.

247
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:43,098
I remember Ferrie speaking
at a meeting of some veterans' group...

248
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,226
...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.

249
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:51,273
They're bringing him out.
Numa, turn it up.

250
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:53,650
Here he comes!

251
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,491
Anything to say in your defense?

252
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,410
Oswald!

253
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,705
He shot him!

254
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,458
He shot him on TV!

255
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,422
There's a man with a gun!

256
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,968
Seventy cops there.
What were they doing?

257
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:26,224
No trial now. Somebody just saved
the Dallas DA a pile of work.

258
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:34,941
Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.

259
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,569
It's wrong. This is crazy!

260
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:56,546
Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,
the business of government went on.

261
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,384
The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,
our Ambassador to Vietnam...

262
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:03,678
...and members of his Cabinet.

263
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,847
The major subject was Vietnam...

264
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,975
...a crisis that does not pause
for bereavement.

265
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,477
From this meeting...

266
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,773
...came affirmations that
the US would continue aiding...

267
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:19,319
...the new government of Vietnam in
its war against the Communist insurgents.

268
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:27,702
David Ferrie.

269
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,539
Come on in.

270
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,124
Thanks for coming.

271
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:37,546
Remember me? We met
on Carondelet Street after your election.

272
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:41,049
I remember.
You make quite an impression.

273
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,094
I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.

274
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:48,557
Legend has it you can get in
and out of the smallest field.

275
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:53,270
I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers
for the field artillery in the war.

276
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,981
Make yourself comfortable.

277
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,484
Mind if I smoke?

278
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,319
How could I?

279
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:05,740
As you know, President Kennedy
was assassinated on Friday.

280
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:09,119
A man named Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested as a suspect...

281
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,455
...then murdered yesterday
by a man named Jack Ruby.

282
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,251
We've had reports that Oswald
spent the summer here...

283
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,461
...and that you knew Oswald.

284
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:23,341
I've never met anyone named Oswald.
Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.

285
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:27,012
He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit
when he was a teenager.

286
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,890
If he did, I don't remember him.

287
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,475
Lots of boys in and out.

288
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:36,479
Surely you've seen this. Perhaps
you knew him under another name?

289
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:41,359
I never saw him before in my life.

290
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,655
Then we must have gotten
mistaken information.

291
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,158
Thanks for straightening it out.

292
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,287
There's one other matter.

293
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:58,835
We heard you went to Texas
shortly after the assassination on Friday.

294
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,379
True. I drove to Houston.

295
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:03,924
What was so appealing about Houston?

296
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:07,844
I hadn't been ice-skating lately.
Some young friends and I...

297
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,971
...decided to go skating.

298
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:12,641
Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...

299
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:16,102
...during one of the worst thunderstorms
in recent memory?

300
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,732
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

301
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,567
Storm wasn't that bad.

302
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:26,154
Where did you drive?

303
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,405
We went to Houston.

304
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,992
Saturday we drove to Galveston,
and stayed there.

305
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,869
And Sunday?

306
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,206
In the morning, we went goose hunting.

307
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,124
Did you bag any?

308
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,585
The boys got a couple.

309
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:42,712
Boys said they didn't get any.

310
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:47,467
They're right.

311
00:21:47,717 --> 00:21:51,429
There were thousands
of geese everywhere.

312
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:55,433
But you couldn't approach them.
They're wise.

313
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:59,604
Your friends said you had no weapons.

314
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:03,483
Isn't it difficult to hunt geese
without a shotgun?

315
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,824
I remember now. I'm sorry.

316
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:12,742
I got confused.

317
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:17,164
We got near the geese, then realized
we had forgotten our shotguns.

318
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,541
Stupid, right?

319
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,170
So, of course, we didn't get any geese.

320
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:26,214
Thank you for your time.

321
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,593
Sorry this must end inconveniently...

322
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:33,096
...but I must detain you for questioning
by the FBl.

323
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,140
Why? What's wrong?

324
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:37,184
Your story is not believable.

325
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,312
Really?

326
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:44,983
What part?

327
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:08,131
This afternoon the FBI released
David W. Ferrie...

328
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:10,091
...of New Orleans.

329
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:13,261
After extensive questioning
and a background check...

330
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:17,974
...the Bureau found no evidence
that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...

331
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:22,229
...or had any connection
with the assassination.

332
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,191
The agent in charge would like
to make clear...

333
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,194
...that Ferrie was brought in
for questioning...

334
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,155
...by the District Attorney
of Orleans Parish.

335
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:35,200
I thought we were on the same side.

336
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,077
Why are they saying that?

337
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:39,538
Pretty fast, the way they let him go.

338
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:42,582
They must know something we don't.

339
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,794
So let's get on with our lives.

340
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:48,588
We have many homegrown crimes
to prosecute.

341
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:50,340
The President has announced...

342
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:53,927
...the creation of a commission
to probe the events in Dallas.

343
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:58,598
It will be headed
by Chief Justice Earl Warren...

344
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:03,937
...and is expected to head off
several Congressional and Texas inquiries.

345
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:07,440
On the panel are Allen Dulles,
ex-chief of the CIA...

346
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:11,319
...Representative Gerald Ford,
banker John McCloy...

347
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:20,287
Fucking out of control.
All these hippies running around on drugs.

348
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:24,040
You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.

349
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:29,421
I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.
You could see her whole belly.

350
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:33,300
You know what she had painted on it?
"Love Child. "

351
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:40,891
It's a mess down there, Jim.

352
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:44,436
We've bitten off more Vietnam
than we can chew.

353
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:48,231
It figures with that polecat Lyndon
in the White House.

354
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:54,070
I sometimes think things have gone
downhill since Kennedy died.

355
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:56,865
Don't get me started on that.

356
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,869
Those Warren Commission fellows
were picking gnat shit out of pepper.

357
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:05,290
Nobody's going to tell me that kid
shot like he did from that bookstore.

358
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,254
But the FBI test-fired the rifle
to see if it could be done.

359
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:14,257
Three experts and not one
of them could do it.

360
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:18,887
They say that Oswald got off three shots
with world-class precision...

361
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:22,724
...from a manual bolt-action rifle
in less than six seconds.

362
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:26,436
According to his Marine buddies,
he got Maggie's drawers.

363
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:29,105
That means he wasn't any good.

364
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:32,150
Average man would be lucky
to shoot twice.

365
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:34,653
And the first would be the best.

366
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,280
Here the third shot's perfect.

367
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:40,534
And they got that bullet zigzagging
all over the place...

368
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,786
...hitting Kennedy and Connally
seven times.

369
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:47,249
One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.

370
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:53,380
Something's always bothered me
about that from day one.

371
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:56,967
Think other men were involved?

372
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:02,430
If I was investigating the case, I'd round
up 100 of the world's best riflemen...

373
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,517
...and find out which ones were
in Dallas that day.

374
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:09,104
You been duck hunting.
Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.

375
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,607
What did he say? "I'm just a patsy! "
Believe it.

376
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:26,746
Dinner's just about ready.

377
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:31,751
Got a surprise for you tonight.
Tried something new.

378
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:39,801
- What?
- Dinner.

379
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:43,638
Smells good. Do you know Oswald...

380
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:46,933
...was interrogated for 12 hours
after the assassination...

381
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:50,937
...with no lawyer present,
and nobody recorded a word of it.

382
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:56,276
I can't believe it. An experienced
police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...

383
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,739
...had to know that with no record,
what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.

384
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:04,117
Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.

385
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:06,161
What are you doing here?

386
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,705
Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.

387
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:10,332
Sure it is.

388
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:13,668
If I handled a minor felon that way,
it'd be all over the papers.

389
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:15,921
This is the alleged murderer
of the President.

390
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,680
Again and again
credible testimony's ignored.

391
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:30,894
Leads are not followed up,
conclusions are selective, no index.

392
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:34,689
It's the sloppiest investigation
I've ever seen.

393
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:39,069
Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...

394
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:41,905
...coming from the grassy knoll
in front of Kennedy...

395
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,407
...not the Book Depository behind him.

396
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:49,246
But it's broken down and spread around.
You read it, but the point is lost.

397
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:51,498
I never believed it.

398
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:54,751
I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.

399
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:58,380
Elizabeth, your bedtime too!

400
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,759
That was three years ago.
We've tried to put it out of our minds.

401
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,886
You keep digging it up.

402
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,347
You're the DA of New Orleans.

403
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,725
Isn't the Kennedy assassination
a bit out of your domain?

404
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:13,687
All those important people studied it.

405
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,899
I can't believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren read those volumes.

406
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,236
Maybe you're right.

407
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:25,949
You got an hour to solve the case
while I get the kids in bed.

408
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:30,495
Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy
will have to wait until morning.

409
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,919
Look, Dad. Look what I drew.

410
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:40,213
That's something. What is it?

411
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,132
It's a rhino in a cage.

412
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:45,594
- Can I stay up another hour?
- I don't think so, Son.

413
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:47,971
Pickle and Snapper, my two...

414
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:50,390
...dancing partners.

415
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:52,475
Good night, doodlebugs.

416
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:55,061
One hour, you hear?

417
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,939
Some Saturday-night date you are.

418
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:02,903
Mama warned me this would happen
if I married such a serious man as you.

419
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:07,115
When I come up, I'll show you
how Saturday night got invented.

420
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:35,977
I sealed off the area and held off the
trains till they could be examined.

421
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:39,689
There were some transients taken on
at least one train.

422
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:46,738
Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us
about this matter. Is that correct?

423
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,031
Yes.

424
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,659
Is there anything else you told us...

425
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:54,037
...that I haven't asked you about,
that you can think of?

426
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,998
Nothing that I can recall.

427
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,584
Witness is excused.

428
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:02,796
A long freight was in there...

429
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:05,882
...and we pulled some people off
and took them to the station.

430
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,388
Do you mean some transients?

431
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:13,139
Tramps and hobos.

432
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:14,808
Were they questioned?

433
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:17,435
They were questioned at the station.

434
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:19,896
Ask the question.

435
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:23,400
Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.

436
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:28,655
Traffic had been cut off
into the area since 10:00.

437
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,242
But three cars came in during this time...

438
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:36,246
...from around noon till the time
of the shooting.

439
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,291
They circled the parking lot and left.

440
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,918
Like they was checking the area.

441
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:44,713
One of the drivers...

442
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:47,674
...was holding something up to his mouth.

443
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:55,265
The last car came in about seven
to ten minutes before the shooting.

444
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:59,186
It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.

445
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:01,897
Muddy up to the windows.

446
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,735
Towards the underpass, I saw two men...

447
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:09,654
...standing behind a picket fence...

448
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:14,409
...looking up towards Main and Houston,
as the caravan came down.

449
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:18,538
One of them was middle-aged...

450
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:19,956
...heavyset.

451
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,501
The other man was younger.

452
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:26,421
Two other men were on the east end
of the parking lot.

453
00:31:26,713 --> 00:31:28,548
They both had uniforms.

454
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:31,176
At the time of the shooting...

455
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,471
...there seemed to be some commotion.

456
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,850
I'm just unable to describe...

457
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:43,396
...a flash of light or smoke or something...

458
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:47,567
...which caused me to feel that something
out of the ordinary...

459
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:49,653
...had occurred on the embankment.

460
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:50,987
Goddamn.

461
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:09,422
No!

462
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,138
- You all right?
- Honey, it's incredible.

463
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:19,099
What?

464
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,393
The whole thing.

465
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:24,271
A Lt. Colonel testifies that...

466
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:28,275
...Oswald had a Russian language exam
as part of his Marine training...

467
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:31,736
...only a few months before he defects
to the Soviet Union.

468
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:33,697
A Russian exam.

469
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:38,702
It's 4:30 in the morning!
I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.

470
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:43,331
In all my years in the military, I never
knew a single man who had a Russian test.

471
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,418
Oswald was a radar operator.

472
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:50,213
He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

473
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:52,924
These books have gotten to your mind!

474
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:56,595
- Stop reading.
- He makes it sound like nothing.

475
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,847
Oswald did badly on his test.

476
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:02,434
He got only two more Russian words right
than wrong.

477
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:06,396
That's like me saying,
Touchdown is not very intelligent...

478
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:09,983
...because I beat him three games
out of five when we played chess.

479
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,488
Are you going to stay up all night,
every night? For what?

480
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:18,366
To be the only man who's read
all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

481
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,577
Do I have to spell it out for you?

482
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:24,122
Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.

483
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,752
He was in military intelligence,
that's why he was trained in Russian.

484
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:31,004
It was no accident he was in Russia.

485
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:34,716
- Go back to sleep.
- I've been sleeping for three years!

486
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:55,445
'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?

487
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,115
7:30 Sunday morning?
Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.

488
00:33:59,574 --> 00:34:01,701
Old stains, but just as telling.

489
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:11,419
531 Lafayette Street.

490
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:14,422
Remember whose office this was in '63?

491
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:17,634
Sure. Guy Banister.

492
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:21,179
Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.

493
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:27,978
He headed the Chicago office. When he
retired he became a private eye here.

494
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:32,023
I used to have lunch with him.
John Birch Society, Minutemen.

495
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:34,609
To the right of Attila the Hun.

496
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,488
Recruited students to infiltrate
radical organizations on campus.

497
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:42,450
Headed the Anti-Communist League
of the Caribbean.

498
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,703
All out of this office.

499
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,041
I want to show you something.

500
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,885
Take a look here.

501
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:02,137
544 Camp Street.

502
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:05,182
531 Lafayette Street.

503
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:07,517
Same building, right?

504
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:11,980
Different addresses, different entrances,
both going to the same place...

505
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:14,191
...to the office upstairs.

506
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:16,359
Guess who used it?

507
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,280
Lee Harvey Oswald.

508
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,492
How do we know that?

509
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:25,744
This address was stamped on...

510
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:30,499
...pro-Castro leaflets he handed out
in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.

511
00:35:30,957 --> 00:35:34,002
The same leaflets they found
in his garage in Dallas.

512
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:40,884
After the arrest, 544 Camp St.
never appeared on the pamphlets again.

513
00:35:42,344 --> 00:35:45,430
He was arrested for fighting
with anti-Castro Cubans.

514
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:48,600
But he'd contacted them already...

515
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:52,270
...as an ex-Marine trying
to join their anti-Castro crusade.

516
00:35:53,104 --> 00:35:57,275
When they heard he was now pro-Castro,
they paid him a visit.

517
00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,695
What's this Fidel shit? You lied to me!

518
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:03,573
Liar! Son of a bitch!

519
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:06,660
Do not take this Communist propaganda!

520
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:09,371
If you want to hit me, hit me.

521
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:10,956
You pinko shit!

522
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:12,707
Go back to Moscow!

523
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:14,835
There was no real fight.

524
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:18,839
The arresting Lieutenant later said
he felt it was a staged incident.

525
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:21,800
In jail, Oswald has a private session...

526
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:24,594
...with Special Agent John Quigley
of the FBl.

527
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,180
Oswald is released.

528
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:30,225
And Quigley destroys his notes
from the interview.

529
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:33,144
The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.

530
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:36,064
And he appears on a local TV debate.

531
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,567
You are a Communist, are you not?

532
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,655
No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.
I'm a Marxist-Leninist.

533
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:47,909
Communist, Marxist-Leninist,
what's the difference?

534
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,874
What if I told you Oswald was trained
in the Russian language in the Marines?

535
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,626
I'd say he got intelligence training.

536
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,795
You were a Marine. Who'd run it?

537
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,839
Office of Naval Intelligence.

538
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,133
Look across the street.

539
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,177
Post Office.

540
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,389
Upstairs, in 1963,
that was the Office of Naval Intelligence.

541
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:13,602
By coincidence, Banister,
before he was FBl, was ONl.

542
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:15,770
What's their saying?

543
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:17,731
"Once ONl, always ONl. "

544
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:20,525
He likes working near his old pals.

545
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,739
We are standing in the heart...

546
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:29,451
...of the US government's intelligence
community in New Orleans.

547
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:31,036
That's the FBl.

548
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:32,412
That's the CIA.

549
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,498
That's the Secret Service.

550
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:35,707
That's the ONl.

551
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,210
Isn't this a strange place...

552
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:40,879
...for a Communist
to spend his spare time?

553
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:45,884
What are you driving at?

554
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,223
We're going back into the case.

555
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,725
The murder of the President.

556
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:56,144
Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.

557
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:58,688
You're awake. I'm deadly serious.

558
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:02,526
Let's track down your anonymous source
from three years ago.

559
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,821
How'd you find out David Ferrie drove
to Texas that day?

560
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:09,574
I can't remember last night,
let alone three years ago, Boss.

561
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:16,373
You're not being cross-examined.

562
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:20,794
I need clarification about the night
Guy Banister beat you over the head.

563
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:23,505
Don't tell me you don't remember.

564
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:28,426
You called our office from your hospital
bed. You were hopping mad about it.

565
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:31,054
Here's my problem.

566
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:34,933
You told me you and Guy were
good friends for a long time.

567
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:37,727
- Over ten years.
- And he never hit you before?

568
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:39,271
Never touched me.

569
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:42,065
Yet, on November 22, 1963...

570
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,526
...the day of the President's murder...

571
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,528
...the police report says...

572
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:50,282
...he pistol-whipped you
with a. 357 Magnum.

573
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:54,244
It also says you argued
about the phone bill. Look!

574
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,791
Is an argument over a phone bill
a believable explanation to you?

575
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,379
There's more to it.

576
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,174
How much more?

577
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:09,301
I shouldn't talk about it.

578
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:12,637
I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.
Heart attack?

579
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:15,182
You buy what you read in the papers.

580
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:18,518
- You have other information?
- I didn't say that!

581
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:23,940
All I know is he died suddenly.
Just before the Warren Report came out.

582
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,694
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

583
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:37,287
You were the only one here!

584
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,080
The only one here!

585
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:46,004
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

586
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:50,675
Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter
no more. It was all about those...

587
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,013
...people that was hanging
around the office that summer.

588
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:58,308
I was never part of the operation.

589
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:02,229
I just handled their private-eye work
as it came in for Guy.

590
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:05,106
Not much did, but that's why I was there.

591
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:08,527
It was a nuthouse.

592
00:40:09,694 --> 00:40:13,907
Cubans coming, going. And Christ,
they all looked the same to me.

593
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:18,161
You going to play with
this rifle or pack it?

594
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:19,788
Dave Ferrie.

595
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:23,333
- You know about him?
- We know Dave. Was he there?

596
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:26,044
He practically lived there.

597
00:40:27,963 --> 00:40:29,756
The whole thing was...

598
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:32,509
...all cloak-and-dagger stuff.

599
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:34,886
They called it "Operation Mongoose. "

600
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:40,851
The idea was to train these Cuban exiles
for another invasion of Cuba.

601
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,396
Banister's office was part
of the supply line...

602
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,982
...from Dallas through New Orleans
to Miami.

603
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:49,067
We stockpiled arms, explosives.

604
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:52,821
In view of the intelligence community
in Lafayette Square?

605
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:57,242
Yes. Everybody knew everybody.
They were all part of the network.

606
00:40:57,617 --> 00:40:59,411
All worked for the CIA.

607
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:05,292
Pilots and black operators
and civilians and the military.

608
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,919
Everybody was running guns then.

609
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:11,965
Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,
Morgan City, you name it.

610
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:15,260
McAllen, Texas? Big gun-run operation.

611
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:21,975
Where does Banister fit in?

612
00:41:22,142 --> 00:41:24,895
He was running his camp
north of Lake Pontchartrain.

613
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,813
Ferrie did a lot of the training.

614
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:31,485
They had a shooting range
and tropical territory, like in Cuba.

615
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:34,446
Some Americans were trained there too.

616
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:36,448
Nazi types. Mercenaries.

617
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:40,660
That Ferrie, though,
Jesus, he was the craziest.

618
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:47,167
Late summer the party was over.
Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.

619
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:50,879
He told the FBl, "Shut up the camp.

620
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:53,715
"Confiscate the napalm, C-4 and all. "

621
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:57,469
The G-men were just going
through the motions.

622
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:01,431
Their hearts were still
with their old FBI buddy Banister.

623
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,310
Oswald?

624
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:11,733
He was there too.

625
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:15,028
Sometimes meeting with Banister.

626
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:19,825
With the door shut.

627
00:42:22,494 --> 00:42:26,414
Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.
But he was there, all right.

628
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,333
Anything more specific, Jack?

629
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:30,168
It's important.

630
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:36,508
One time, the secretary got upset.

631
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:39,970
I can't believe it, Mr. Banister,
Oswald is down on Canal Street...

632
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:43,181
...handing out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro.

633
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:50,605
It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

634
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:54,901
Was anyone else involved at...

635
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:56,528
...Banister's level?

636
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,281
One guy. I don't know who.

637
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:02,033
Big. White hair.

638
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:06,329
I saw him in the office once.
He looked out of place.

639
00:43:06,746 --> 00:43:08,665
You know, a society guy.

640
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:12,169
Can't remember his name,
but Oswald was with him.

641
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:17,799
He had something to do with money,
because Banister never kissed ass...

642
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,759
...but he kissed his.

643
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:28,476
Clay something.

644
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,478
That was his name. Clay...

645
00:43:30,562 --> 00:43:31,897
- Bertrand?
- Yeah.

646
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,274
- Clay Bertrand?
- I don't know.

647
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:36,776
- Maybe not.
- No, that's right.

648
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,944
I must go.

649
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:41,573
He was in the Warren Report.
He got Oswald a lawyer.

650
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:43,825
Was Kennedy discussed?

651
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,160
I don't know.

652
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:47,746
- The assassination?
- No.

653
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:50,248
- Not with me. I've got to go.
- Hold on.

654
00:43:50,457 --> 00:43:53,001
- That's all I'll say.
- What's the problem?

655
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:59,341
Do I have to spell it out for you?

656
00:43:59,424 --> 00:44:02,010
Nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

657
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:05,263
You are so naive.

658
00:44:15,857 --> 00:44:19,861
- When'd you do business with Bertrand?
- Pipe the bimbo in red.

659
00:44:21,822 --> 00:44:24,783
- Lawdy.
- She's not as cute as you.

660
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:30,121
- You should try a legitimate business.
- Why are you dancing on my head?

661
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:33,542
- We've been friends since law school.
- Because you're conning me.

662
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,044
- I read your testimony.
- Grain of salt.

663
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:40,131
You said Clay Bertrand called you
the day after the assassination...

664
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:43,468
- ... and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.
- Right.

665
00:44:44,636 --> 00:44:46,388
That's pretty important.

666
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:51,476
You told the FBI he's 6' 2".
Then you tell the Commission he's 5' 8".

667
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:54,312
How the hell does a man shrink like that?

668
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:59,234
They put the heat on me, like you. I gave
them whatever popped in my cabeza.

669
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:01,820
Truth is, I never met the dude.

670
00:45:03,155 --> 00:45:05,657
- One likes friends that have friends.
- Indeed.

671
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,910
I don't know what that cat looks like
or where he's at.

672
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:11,788
All I know is sometimes
he sends me some cases.

673
00:45:12,122 --> 00:45:15,750
One day he calls, talks to me
about repping Oswald in Dallas.

674
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:18,461
- You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?
- No.

675
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:22,174
I told that Bertrand cat right off
this ain't my scene.

676
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,887
- I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.
- Then how did you get in the Commission?

677
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:29,723
Like I told the Washington boys...

678
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,935
...Bertrand asked me that summer to help
the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.

679
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:38,273
Mr. Bertrand said
he would take care of any of-

680
00:45:38,356 --> 00:45:39,107
Fine.

681
00:45:39,191 --> 00:45:43,236
- To whom am I speaking?
- Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.

682
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:47,866
There was no conspiracy. If there was,
why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?

683
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:49,910
He was his brother.

684
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,246
How'd so many people keep such a secret?

685
00:45:53,997 --> 00:45:57,751
- It was Oswald. He hated-
- We're having a communication problem.

686
00:45:57,834 --> 00:46:02,589
I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.
Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.

687
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:07,344
I'm aware of our friendship,
but I'll call you before the grand jury.

688
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:11,932
You lie to them as you lied to me,
I'll charge you with perjury.

689
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:14,768
I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.

690
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:17,771
I beat them all.
Am I communicating with you?

691
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,316
Off the record?

692
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:25,695
In that case, let me sum it up for you.

693
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,869
If I answer that question you keep asking...

694
00:46:33,787 --> 00:46:36,665
...if I give you the name
of the big enchilada...

695
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:40,168
...then it's bon voyage, Deano.

696
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:42,712
Like a bullet in my head, you dig?

697
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:46,716
You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.
JFK's dead as that crabmeat.

698
00:46:47,217 --> 00:46:49,886
The government's still breathing.

699
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:53,515
Either you give the grand jury
Clay Bertrand's real identity...

700
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:56,393
...or your fat behind's
going to the slammer.

701
00:46:56,726 --> 00:47:00,063
You're as crazy as your mama.
It's in the genes.

702
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,899
Do you know what you're getting into?

703
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:07,779
The government will jump all over
your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.

704
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,073
Good day to you, sir.

705
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:18,540
District Attorney Garrison
to see Prisoner 5388.

706
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:20,667
Ward block 237B.

707
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:36,641
We don't need gates with that swamp.

708
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,687
Many of them gone in there,
none of them came out.

709
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,371
You got visitors here.
Don't give them trouble.

710
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,958
- How you doing, Mr. Broussard?
- Let's go, Willie.

711
00:48:14,054 --> 00:48:16,431
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.

712
00:48:17,098 --> 00:48:18,850
I got nothing but time.

713
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:21,937
Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.

714
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:26,733
Time stands still here,
like a snake sunning itself.

715
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:28,527
Clay Bertrand?

716
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,491
I met him sometime in...

717
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:37,702
...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

718
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:41,039
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

719
00:48:41,581 --> 00:48:42,958
Sexual purposes?

720
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:45,669
Did he pay you?

721
00:48:46,002 --> 00:48:49,506
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

722
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,174
Anything unusual about him...

723
00:48:51,258 --> 00:48:53,593
...you'd be able to describe in court?

724
00:48:53,677 --> 00:48:56,972
He had something wrong with his leg,
a limp.

725
00:48:57,097 --> 00:49:00,016
Don't get me wrong.
He's not one of those limp wrists.

726
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,144
He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,
you'd never snap.

727
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:07,899
You could play poker with him,
go fishing, you'd never snap.

728
00:49:08,316 --> 00:49:10,777
One night we were at David Ferrie's...

729
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:13,864
...sometime late in the summer of '63.

730
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:18,285
There was about nine to ten people there.

731
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:22,873
Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff
in the bush with him. Place was a mess.

732
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:26,084
Dave's mind was a mess.
He had caged mice...

733
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:29,045
...'cause he's working on a cancer cure.

734
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:33,341
Dave's smart, though.
Speaks five languages.

735
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:38,305
Knows philosophy, medicine,
military history, politics.

736
00:49:38,805 --> 00:49:42,893
He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

737
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:45,437
That's where you first met Oswald?

738
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,565
Strange guy. Dave introduced him as...

739
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:49,941
Leon Oswald.

740
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:51,610
How you doing?

741
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:54,613
What the fuck is he doing here?

742
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:56,406
Fuck you, motherfucker.

743
00:49:58,575 --> 00:50:01,495
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

744
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,789
You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

745
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:07,626
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

746
00:50:08,043 --> 00:50:09,586
I'm already in jail.

747
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:11,004
Go on.

748
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:14,674
Finally they left
and I was alone with Dave...

749
00:50:14,883 --> 00:50:16,384
...and this Leon...

750
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,095
...two of the Cubans,
and this guy Bertrand.

751
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:22,474
Dave pulled out some clippings.

752
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:25,769
He'd been obsessed with Castro
and Kennedy for months.

753
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:30,732
Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!
Took our C-4!

754
00:50:30,857 --> 00:50:34,903
Took 10,000 rounds!
3,000 pounds of gunpowder!

755
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:36,363
All our weapons!

756
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:40,784
You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

757
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:43,995
Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty. How can we?

758
00:50:44,204 --> 00:50:47,165
Problem is getting to him.
Informers on every block.

759
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:49,084
They got new stuff!

760
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:53,880
I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

761
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,215
No trace!

762
00:50:55,298 --> 00:50:59,302
Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous...

763
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:05,225
Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals
with that bastard Khrushchev.

764
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,227
Licking his ass.

765
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:13,358
An inspired act of God should happen here
and put a Texan in the White House!

766
00:51:15,193 --> 00:51:18,280
The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.

767
00:51:19,406 --> 00:51:21,449
He started in on Kennedy again.

768
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:24,995
I will kill! In the White House!
Stab him in the heart!

769
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,581
Somebody must get rid of him!

770
00:51:28,957 --> 00:51:31,251
You won't get that son of a bitch!

771
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:34,838
It won't be long.
That fucker will get what he deserves.

772
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:38,341
It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

773
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:40,802
We just need to get him in the open.

774
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:44,306
Always some harebrained scheme.

775
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:50,687
Let's have some more champagne,
shall we?

776
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,315
What about the Secret Service? The cops?

777
00:51:53,773 --> 00:51:57,360
If it's planned right, no problem.
They got close to De Gaulle.

778
00:51:57,611 --> 00:51:59,613
Eisenhower always rode in open top.

779
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:02,782
We need three mechanics
in three different locations.

780
00:52:03,116 --> 00:52:05,660
An office building, a high-powered rifle.

781
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:09,706
Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.
That's the key.

782
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:13,335
A diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one way.

783
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:15,170
Boom! Get the kill shot.

784
00:52:16,171 --> 00:52:18,256
One man has to be sacrificed.

785
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:21,676
In the commotion, the job gets done.

786
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,762
The others leave the country.

787
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:28,767
Let's drop this subject.
It's one thing to banter with these kids...

788
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:32,729
...but this sort of thing could be
so easily misunderstood.

789
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:37,108
I didn't think much about it then.
It's just bullshit.

790
00:52:37,192 --> 00:52:39,986
People like to act more important
than they are.

791
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:42,155
Especially in the homosexual underworld.

792
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,450
But when they got him...

793
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:47,410
...I got scared.

794
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:49,079
Real scared.

795
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:50,956
That's when I got popped.

796
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,292
The things you said will be attacked
by many people.

797
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:59,339
Bring them on. Bring their college degrees
in here, I got nothing to hide.

798
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:01,466
No one can buy me.

799
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:05,011
- I don't even need this parole.
- What parole?

800
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:10,058
You liberal, you don't know shit
'cause you never been fucked in the ass.

801
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:14,229
This ain't about justice!
No, this is about order!

802
00:53:14,604 --> 00:53:16,940
Who rules? Fascism is coming back.

803
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:21,027
Nobody wants to buy you.
No one's promising you parole.

804
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:27,450
What I need to know
is why are you telling us this.

805
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:30,203
'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...

806
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:33,123
...stole that motherfucking election,
that's why.

807
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:37,085
Nixon was going to be a great President
until Kennedy wrecked this country.

808
00:53:37,169 --> 00:53:41,381
Niggers wanting rights!
Why do you think we have all this crime.

809
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:44,384
He promised those motherfuckers
too much!

810
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:47,554
Revolution's coming, bullshit!
Fascism's coming back!

811
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:52,517
The day that Communist son of a bitch
died was a great day!

812
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:54,603
A great day for this country.

813
00:53:54,895 --> 00:53:58,482
I hate to think they blame it
on silly, fucking Oswald.

814
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:01,067
Didn't know shit, anyway.

815
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:04,738
People got to know.
People got to know why he was killed.

816
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:08,116
Because he was a Communist.

817
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:13,371
You go ahead, put me on the stand,
I'll tell the same goddamned story!

818
00:54:13,622 --> 00:54:15,290
Don't matter to me!

819
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,002
All right, Willie. Thanks.

820
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:21,505
We'll be in touch.

821
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,881
All right.

822
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,680
You know, you're not a bad-looking man.

823
00:54:31,306 --> 00:54:32,557
Not bad at all.

824
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:36,228
I get out of here, I'll come see you.
We can have fun!

825
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,064
Their testimony won't hold up in court.

826
00:54:39,147 --> 00:54:42,234
Their reputations are lower
than crocodile piss.

827
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:44,277
That bothers you?

828
00:54:45,904 --> 00:54:50,116
If a woman's a prostitute,
must she also have bad eyesight?

829
00:54:51,618 --> 00:54:54,496
Find Clay Bertrand.
Start by checking around the Quarter.

830
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:57,457
The six of us,
with almost no budget and in secret...

831
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:00,210
...will solve a case
the Warren Commission couldn't?

832
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:04,130
- I didn't pick you for your legal skill.
- Thanks, Boss.

833
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:08,260
You're a fighter.
I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.

834
00:55:08,677 --> 00:55:11,429
Mr. Garrison, how are you?
Remember me?

835
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:12,973
You vote for me?

836
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:16,518
I did. We sang together
at the Royal Orleans, remember?

837
00:55:16,726 --> 00:55:17,894
We sang:

838
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:21,106
"You're the cream in my coffee"

839
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:25,443
Haven't seen you much lately.

840
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:29,739
Been too busy. Elected men can't have
as much fun as they used to.

841
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:33,201
It's always nice to see you.
Pleasure to serve you always.

842
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,372
How are you? Nice to see you.

843
00:55:38,456 --> 00:55:40,041
Welcome back, Lou.

844
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,130
- Think I could get a martini?
- They're waiting for you, sir.

845
00:55:46,506 --> 00:55:48,550
Keep that table open for us.

846
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:53,346
Anything on the hoboes?

847
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:57,058
Dallas Times Herald photographer
got great shots.

848
00:55:57,809 --> 00:55:59,352
Never published.

849
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:04,065
Can't say that comes as a surprise.

850
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:09,571
They took them to the sheriff's
and let them go. No record of questioning.

851
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:13,658
Do they look like the hoboes
you remember?

852
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,369
These two look young.

853
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,832
Not a frayed collar or cuff,
fresh haircuts and shaves...

854
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:24,628
- ... clean hands, new shoe leather.
- Who the hell are they then?

855
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:29,341
Sit down.

856
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:34,554
This could be it. Let's look for them.

857
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:40,101
What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,
who saw the men at the picket fence?

858
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,188
Graveyard. Dead. August this year.

859
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:47,400
Single-car accident on an empty road
in Midlothian, Texas.

860
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:50,862
The doctor said he was in a strange shock
when he died.

861
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:53,365
We need to find more witnesses.

862
00:56:53,573 --> 00:56:55,951
There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.

863
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:59,162
She said she was a dope runner
for Jack Ruby.

864
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:03,124
And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

865
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:06,670
- Can we talk to her?
- She's dead too.

866
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:08,547
Hit and run.

867
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:16,012
Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?

868
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:21,268
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

869
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:25,522
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

870
00:57:25,939 --> 00:57:29,901
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

871
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,155
Negative on his tax records. Classified.

872
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:36,366
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

873
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:41,705
I asked for the CIA files on Oswald
that were part of the Warren Report.

874
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:47,335
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

875
00:57:47,502 --> 00:57:50,922
All classified as secret on the grounds
of national security.

876
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:55,552
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

877
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:57,804
Lonely kid, no father.

878
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:00,307
Joins the Marines at 17.

879
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:03,560
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

880
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:07,856
But he's stationed
at a top-secret air base in Japan...

881
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:10,901
...where U-2 spy flights
over Russia originate.

882
00:58:11,526 --> 00:58:13,069
He's discharged...

883
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:16,781
...supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

884
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:21,745
Then, with a $1,500 ticket from
a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.

885
00:58:22,204 --> 00:58:23,914
Mr. Oswald, do you understand...

886
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,125
- ... the action you are about to take?
- Yes, I do, sir.

887
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:32,714
I wish to renounce my citizenship...

888
00:58:33,465 --> 00:58:35,926
...and become a Soviet citizen.

889
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:40,597
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

890
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:44,226
He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

891
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:47,687
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...

892
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:51,066
...where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

893
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:54,986
He's given 5,000 rubles,
a roomy apartment with a balcony.

894
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:58,281
Has affairs with local girls.

895
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:00,450
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

896
00:59:01,785 --> 00:59:05,372
But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

897
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,041
He meets Marina.

898
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,628
Her uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence.

899
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,674
She thinks he's Russian by his speech.

900
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:18,718
Six weeks later they marry,
have a daughter.

901
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:23,223
Only explanation for the royal treatment
is he gave them radar secrets.

902
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,850
Or fake secrets.

903
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:27,060
Six months after he's in Russia...

904
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:30,605
...Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight
goes down...

905
00:59:30,856 --> 00:59:33,441
...in Russia. That plane was untouchable.

906
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:35,360
Powers hinted that Oswald...

907
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:38,446
...could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

908
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:43,076
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

909
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,372
Perhaps our military didn't want
the conference to happen?

910
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:51,001
Maybe Oswald was part of that!

911
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:55,630
- Stick to what you can prove in court.
- You want facts?

912
00:59:56,256 --> 00:59:59,843
Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

913
01:00:00,802 --> 01:00:03,263
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

914
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:07,100
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours...

915
01:00:07,184 --> 01:00:09,186
...and loans him travel money.

916
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:14,858
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information...

917
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,861
...or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

918
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:21,990
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

919
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:25,160
Did Marina have problems getting out?

920
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:29,581
None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

921
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:35,086
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people...

922
01:00:35,337 --> 01:00:38,673
...get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

923
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:40,008
Doesn't add up.

924
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:43,512
Next thing, he's living in
Dallas-Fort Worth, October '62...

925
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:46,890
...working six months
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall...

926
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:50,477
...a photographic firm that makes maps
for the US Army.

927
01:00:51,728 --> 01:00:55,148
Oswald becomes chummy
with the Dallas White Russian community.

928
01:00:55,232 --> 01:00:56,983
All rabid anti-Communists.

929
01:00:57,526 --> 01:00:58,485
It's odd.

930
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:03,990
His closest friend is an oilman,
named George DeMohrenschildt.

931
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:09,538
He is 35 years older than Oswald,
who is only 23 and supposedly broke.

932
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,335
He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,
speaks five languages...

933
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,380
...and was a French Vichy intelligence
during the war...

934
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,758
...also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.

935
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:27,848
DeMohrenschildt draws a picture
of Oswald as an intellectual...

936
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:32,185
...well read, speaks excellent Russian,
a man who adored JFK.

937
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:38,942
I think he's made some mistakes
regarding Cuba.

938
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:43,864
I think he's doing a pretty good job.
If he succeeds, in my opinion...

939
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:47,325
...I think he'd make a great President
and a handsome one, too.

940
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:50,245
That's scenery, Susie.
Now, don't get sidetracked.

941
01:01:50,328 --> 01:01:54,166
This is the same man that nailed Oswald
to the Warren Commission...

942
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:57,294
...as a potentially violent man
and linked him to the rifle.

943
01:01:57,544 --> 01:02:00,922
Well, in that sense
Castro is an experimenter.

944
01:02:02,924 --> 01:02:05,260
It could go any way with that country.

945
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:08,805
- It could go the way of the communism-
- What you got there?

946
01:02:10,056 --> 01:02:12,017
Do you have rifles in there?

947
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:18,857
Tell me what I'm shooting at,
rabbits or Fascists?

948
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:22,444
- I hunt.
- You hunt?

949
01:02:23,195 --> 01:02:26,031
We don't know he's CIA.
Let's circle him very probable.

950
01:02:26,114 --> 01:02:27,866
Call him Oswald's handler.

951
01:02:28,283 --> 01:02:32,662
The Oswalds are introduced
to Janet and Bill Williams.

952
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:39,377
It's through Janet Williams,
in October '63, that Lee gets the job...

953
01:02:39,628 --> 01:02:42,923
...at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

954
01:02:43,882 --> 01:02:48,637
So he can now exercise his intellect,
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.

955
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,767
Marina fights with Lee about many things.

956
01:02:56,144 --> 01:02:58,480
His secrecy, their lack of money.

957
01:02:59,397 --> 01:03:02,400
She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.

958
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:07,322
Lee hits her on several occasions.

959
01:03:08,365 --> 01:03:09,825
At the age of 24...

960
01:03:09,908 --> 01:03:13,328
...he rents a room in Dallas
under the alias of O.H. Lee.

961
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:16,665
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

962
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,417
No, thank you. I'm fine.

963
01:03:20,544 --> 01:03:24,422
All I know about the Williams is
their tax returns are classified.

964
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:28,093
Bill Williams has links to the CIA
through his family...

965
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:31,012
...and does classified work
for Bell Helicopter.

966
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:35,642
Bill's convenient separation from Janet
allows Marina to move into her house...

967
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,770
...where she suddenly becomes
Marina's best friend.

968
01:03:38,854 --> 01:03:41,857
There Marina and Lee
have a second daughter.

969
01:03:43,108 --> 01:03:45,735
I have to go away. Just for a short while.

970
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:48,738
What's wrong with this family?

971
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:50,240
I love Lee...

972
01:03:50,615 --> 01:03:52,742
...and I sorry him.

973
01:03:53,326 --> 01:03:54,536
Sorry for him?

974
01:03:55,453 --> 01:03:56,246
Yes.

975
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:59,291
When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

976
01:03:59,374 --> 01:04:02,669
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

977
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,796
I have too much facts...

978
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,842
...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

979
01:04:09,217 --> 01:04:12,554
After being locked away
by the feds for two months...

980
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,806
...and afraid she'd be deported...

981
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,268
...she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

982
01:04:18,685 --> 01:04:20,687
They taught her how to answer.

983
01:04:20,812 --> 01:04:23,815
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses...

984
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:26,359
...polish her appearance and wheel her out.

985
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:30,071
- I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.
- Oswald was no angel.

986
01:04:31,448 --> 01:04:32,824
But who was he?

987
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:35,452
I'm lost. What are we saying?

988
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:40,165
That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

989
01:04:41,082 --> 01:04:45,754
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

990
01:04:47,005 --> 01:04:49,508
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...

991
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:53,053
...the intelligence community
murdered the President?

992
01:04:54,346 --> 01:04:56,681
I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...

993
01:04:56,765 --> 01:04:58,558
...didn't pull the trigger.

994
01:04:58,642 --> 01:05:02,312
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

995
01:05:02,395 --> 01:05:06,066
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

996
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:10,070
- His palm print was on it.
- It went to the FBl.

997
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:12,823
FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.

998
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:17,828
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

999
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:22,541
It could've been taken at the morgue.
There's no chain of evidence.

1000
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:27,087
I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon...

1001
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:30,632
...to a P.O. box, when he can go
into any store in Texas...

1002
01:05:31,341 --> 01:05:34,803
...give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

1003
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,304
To frame him, obviously!

1004
01:05:36,388 --> 01:05:38,598
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

1005
01:05:38,765 --> 01:05:40,767
We're talking about our government!

1006
01:05:40,851 --> 01:05:43,103
We're talking about a crime.

1007
01:05:43,854 --> 01:05:47,023
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

1008
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:49,818
We're through the looking glass.

1009
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,112
White is black.

1010
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,531
And black is white.

1011
01:05:55,574 --> 01:05:58,201
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

1012
01:05:59,035 --> 01:06:00,120
A patsy.

1013
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:08,253
Unbelievable. You were here?

1014
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:10,630
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

1015
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:14,593
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there...

1016
01:06:16,011 --> 01:06:17,596
...near the overpass.

1017
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:21,725
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

1018
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,519
I made it clear to the Warren people.

1019
01:06:24,603 --> 01:06:27,647
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

1020
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:32,402
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

1021
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:34,529
Out from under those trees.

1022
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:38,033
All four of us railroad men...

1023
01:06:38,116 --> 01:06:39,826
...seen the same thing.

1024
01:06:40,452 --> 01:06:42,496
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

1025
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:46,791
I was standing next to Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.

1026
01:06:49,586 --> 01:06:51,963
I stepped down to the curb and yelled:

1027
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:54,674
"Mr. President, look over here! "

1028
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:58,261
Then shots rang out.

1029
01:07:00,388 --> 01:07:05,477
Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,
"They're shooting! Get down! "

1030
01:07:06,686 --> 01:07:08,605
I just stood there watching.

1031
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,149
The driver had stopped.

1032
01:07:12,067 --> 01:07:13,985
I don't know what was wrong with him.

1033
01:07:16,613 --> 01:07:18,615
Out of the corner of my eye...

1034
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,535
...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1035
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:23,787
And that last shot...

1036
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,665
...just ripped his head off.

1037
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:31,962
I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

1038
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:34,464
We came around to look for tracks.

1039
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:38,134
It rained that morning
and we found a bunch.

1040
01:07:38,844 --> 01:07:40,053
Cigarette butts.

1041
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:42,556
Someone had stood about... here.

1042
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:50,438
That's a good spot.

1043
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:52,691
For the head shot.

1044
01:07:54,568 --> 01:07:56,444
Everything was just frozen.

1045
01:07:57,404 --> 01:08:01,533
Like people weren't breathing.
Like you were looking at a picture.

1046
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:06,121
Except for one man.

1047
01:08:07,122 --> 01:08:11,459
I saw this one man running
from the corner of the Book Depository...

1048
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:12,961
...to the parking lot.

1049
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:15,005
It was about 11:00 a. m.

1050
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:19,050
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1051
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:21,178
A light-blue Valiant.

1052
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,223
I'll never forget that day.
There was a lot of traffic...

1053
01:08:25,307 --> 01:08:28,143
...and I stopped
alongside a green pickup truck.

1054
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,647
It was very noticeable
because it had one wheel up on the curb.

1055
01:08:33,064 --> 01:08:34,900
When I saw the gun, I thought...

1056
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:39,613
..."The Secret Service is not very secret. "

1057
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:42,491
The next morning, I went to the FBI office.

1058
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:44,701
They showed me some pictures.

1059
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:48,747
And I picked out three pictures
that looked like the truck's driver.

1060
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:51,082
That's the man.

1061
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,793
You mean you identified Jack Ruby
on Saturday?

1062
01:08:54,044 --> 01:08:55,003
That's right.

1063
01:08:55,086 --> 01:08:56,755
The day before he shot Oswald?

1064
01:08:57,005 --> 01:09:00,425
That's right. When I saw him on TV,
I was shocked.

1065
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:04,095
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck. "

1066
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:08,350
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1067
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,853
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1068
01:09:13,021 --> 01:09:16,191
They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1069
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:18,944
It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.

1070
01:09:20,695 --> 01:09:24,032
I thought maybe our guys had shot back
and got one of them.

1071
01:09:25,116 --> 01:09:26,868
I got to the parking lot.

1072
01:09:27,661 --> 01:09:30,872
All I saw were the railroad workers
and Dallas' finest.

1073
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:36,837
- Secret Service. Come with us.
- No! Find the shooter!

1074
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,922
I want your pictures.

1075
01:09:39,005 --> 01:09:40,215
Son of a bitch!

1076
01:09:40,298 --> 01:09:42,300
He put a hurt on me, but good.

1077
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:47,900
They must've seen everything because
they knew what we had done all day.

1078
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:51,235
I wasn't hard to find,
wearing that red raincoat.

1079
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:54,280
- How many shots did you hear?
- Four to six.

1080
01:09:55,448 --> 01:09:56,616
Impossible!

1081
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,243
You heard echoes!

1082
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:05,208
We have three bullets and three shots
that came from the Book Depository.

1083
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:07,669
- That's all we'll say.
- No, sir.

1084
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:13,091
I saw a man shooting from behind
that fence. What are you going to do?

1085
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:16,594
- You go out there and get him!
- That's taken care of!

1086
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:20,306
You only heard three shots,
and don't discuss this with anyone.

1087
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:22,433
No one. Understand?

1088
01:10:22,642 --> 01:10:26,312
Which is strange 'cause it's less
than 20 minutes after the assassination.

1089
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:27,814
Get her out of here.

1090
01:10:27,897 --> 01:10:30,358
I knew something was crooked
as a dog's hind leg.

1091
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:34,988
When I read my testimony
in the Warren Report...

1092
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:37,615
...it was a total fabrication.

1093
01:10:37,907 --> 01:10:41,953
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.
They've altered my statements.

1094
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,622
This one says:

1095
01:10:44,914 --> 01:10:49,502
"Mercer couldn't identify any photograph
as being the man she observed...

1096
01:10:49,585 --> 01:10:52,880
"... slouched over the wheel
of the green truck. " Not true.

1097
01:10:52,964 --> 01:10:55,591
I recognized him and I told them so.

1098
01:10:56,592 --> 01:10:57,927
Take your time.

1099
01:10:58,094 --> 01:10:58,928
I'm sure.

1100
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:00,930
And the sheriff's report...

1101
01:11:01,347 --> 01:11:02,849
This is really strange.

1102
01:11:03,182 --> 01:11:05,310
See that notarized signature?

1103
01:11:06,477 --> 01:11:07,937
That's not mine.

1104
01:11:08,104 --> 01:11:11,190
There wasn't any notary present
during my questioning.

1105
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:15,570
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man...

1106
01:11:17,655 --> 01:11:19,824
...it's difficult to accept this.

1107
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:23,411
Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison
about the Carousel Club.

1108
01:11:29,709 --> 01:11:33,671
I used to go there to see Jack
and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.

1109
01:11:34,422 --> 01:11:36,799
It was a real swinging spot in town.

1110
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:38,176
Everybody came.

1111
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:42,013
Businessmen, politicians from Austin,
LBJ's friends-

1112
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:44,682
Dallas was a slowpokin' town then.

1113
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:48,478
You chewed toothpicks, played dominoes,
spit, dated policemen.

1114
01:11:48,853 --> 01:11:52,273
But Jack was exciting.
There were always cops there.

1115
01:11:52,357 --> 01:11:56,194
Jack liked them around, even though
he threw out the drunks himself.

1116
01:11:56,861 --> 01:11:58,571
He had a violent temper.

1117
01:11:59,822 --> 01:12:02,784
Everyone in those days
knew Jack was in the mob.

1118
01:12:03,868 --> 01:12:06,454
Cops back then, they were bad.

1119
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,958
They'd shake you down
for the money in your pocket.

1120
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:13,503
What about Lee?

1121
01:12:14,879 --> 01:12:16,214
One time I came in.

1122
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:20,718
Jack introduced me to two guys.
He says, "This is my friend, Lee... "

1123
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:25,390
I don't remember the other guy's name.

1124
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:29,394
He was a weird-looking guy.
He had these eyebrows.

1125
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:31,896
And he looked like a buzzard.

1126
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,818
Lee didn't make much of an impression.

1127
01:12:37,944 --> 01:12:39,988
He wasn't very handsome.

1128
01:12:40,196 --> 01:12:43,741
He didn't look like he had any money,
and he was in a bad mood.

1129
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,035
So, I didn't pay him much mind.

1130
01:12:47,954 --> 01:12:51,165
I may not remember a name,
but I always remember a face.

1131
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:55,295
Later, when I saw him on television...

1132
01:12:56,713 --> 01:12:58,965
...I screamed, "My God, that's him!

1133
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,301
"That's Jack's friend! "

1134
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:04,721
Will you testify, Beverly?

1135
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:10,101
- I don't think so.
- I thought we had an agreement.

1136
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:17,984
- I don't want to be another statistic.
- We could call you in.

1137
01:13:18,443 --> 01:13:22,030
If they can kill the President
of the United States...

1138
01:13:23,573 --> 01:13:27,327
...you think they'll think twice
about a two-bit showgirl like me?

1139
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:35,835
I understand the pressure you're under.

1140
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:38,379
Don't think that I don't.

1141
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:41,007
We both do.

1142
01:13:46,971 --> 01:13:52,268
Mr. Chief Justice, do you understand
that I can't tell the truth in Dallas?

1143
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:56,940
There are people here who do not want me
to tell the truth.

1144
01:13:57,106 --> 01:13:59,359
Who don't want me to have a retrial.

1145
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:01,986
Why don't you just tell us now?

1146
01:14:02,528 --> 01:14:04,197
My life is in danger!

1147
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:07,075
If you request that I go to Washington...

1148
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:10,328
That is, if you want to hear
further testimony from me.

1149
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:12,121
Can you take me with you?

1150
01:14:12,205 --> 01:14:14,040
No. It can't be done.

1151
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,668
There would be no safe place for you.

1152
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:19,337
We're not law-enforcement officers.

1153
01:14:20,254 --> 01:14:23,383
There's a great deal
at stake in this matter.

1154
01:14:24,592 --> 01:14:26,427
If I'm eliminated...

1155
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:31,265
...there won't be any way of knowing
any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.

1156
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:36,854
Consequently, a whole new form
of government will take over.

1157
01:14:38,898 --> 01:14:41,901
And I won't live to see you
some other time.

1158
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,279
I want to tell the truth.

1159
01:14:44,362 --> 01:14:45,530
And then...

1160
01:14:45,697 --> 01:14:47,365
...leave this world.

1161
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:53,121
The Zapruder film establishes
three shots in 5.6 seconds.

1162
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:57,917
I'm Oswald.

1163
01:14:59,002 --> 01:15:00,295
Time me.

1164
01:15:01,379 --> 01:15:02,463
Go.

1165
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:08,720
Time?

1166
01:15:08,928 --> 01:15:10,596
Between six and seven seconds.

1167
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,098
Without really aiming.

1168
01:15:12,181 --> 01:15:15,935
The second and third shots came
almost right on top of each other.

1169
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,771
It takes a minimum of...

1170
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:21,399
...2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.

1171
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,360
The other problem is, there was a tree...

1172
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:28,573
...blocking the first two shots
when fired in the Zapruder film.

1173
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:32,910
Didn't Hoover say something
about leaves falling in November?

1174
01:15:33,411 --> 01:15:35,496
It was Texas live oak, Chief.

1175
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,458
It sheds its leaves in early March.

1176
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:42,462
Take this Carcano,
world's worst shoulder weapon...

1177
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:47,133
...and try to hit a moving target
at 88 yards through heavy foliage.

1178
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,926
No way.

1179
01:15:51,971 --> 01:15:54,223
FBI tried two sets of tests.

1180
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:57,518
Not one sharpshooter could match
Oswald's performance.

1181
01:15:57,894 --> 01:15:59,187
Not one.

1182
01:15:59,312 --> 01:16:01,814
Oswald was at best a medium shot.

1183
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,525
The scope was defective on it too.

1184
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:07,695
This is the whole essence
of the case to me.

1185
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,698
The guy couldn't do the shooting.

1186
01:16:11,157 --> 01:16:12,492
Nobody could.

1187
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:15,453
They sold this lemon
to the American public.

1188
01:16:17,288 --> 01:16:20,375
The Zapruder film was the proof
they didn't count on.

1189
01:16:21,292 --> 01:16:23,002
We must get hold of it.

1190
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:27,340
It means we'll have to subpoena Time-Life.

1191
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:30,468
Let me ask you something.

1192
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,137
Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?

1193
01:16:33,513 --> 01:16:35,098
Plenty of time.

1194
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:39,435
- He's out in the open.
- I keep asking myself the same thing.

1195
01:16:39,519 --> 01:16:41,938
- Frontal shot.
- Even if you miss him once...

1196
01:16:42,146 --> 01:16:44,399
...if he accelerates, you get a second shot.

1197
01:16:44,482 --> 01:16:46,526
The only reason to get him on Elm...

1198
01:16:47,193 --> 01:16:50,154
...is you got him in a
triangulated crossfire.

1199
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:53,825
You put a team there down at the fence.

1200
01:16:54,033 --> 01:16:56,661
Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.

1201
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:00,665
Put a third team down in this building...

1202
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,041
...on a low floor.

1203
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:05,336
When Kennedy gets in the kill zone,
it's a turkey shoot.

1204
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:09,590
How many men?

1205
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:15,138
One shooter. One spotter on a radio.
Maybe three teams.

1206
01:17:17,598 --> 01:17:20,852
These are professional riflemen.
Serious people.

1207
01:17:22,061 --> 01:17:23,229
Hunters.

1208
01:17:25,064 --> 01:17:26,357
Patient.

1209
01:17:28,318 --> 01:17:30,570
It takes skill to kill with a rifle.

1210
01:17:33,698 --> 01:17:38,369
That's why no chief executive's
been executed with one in 200 years.

1211
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,082
Three...

1212
01:17:44,042 --> 01:17:45,126
...two...

1213
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:47,629
...one.

1214
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,432
Main Street's over there.

1215
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:02,977
Original parade route on the way
to the Trade Mart...

1216
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:05,188
...is too far, right?

1217
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,397
Too far.

1218
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:10,443
Impossible shot,
so they change the parade route.

1219
01:18:10,693 --> 01:18:13,696
Bring him down here.
Moving at a normal 25 mph.

1220
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:17,075
They knew the motorcade would have
to slow down to about 10 mph...

1221
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:20,286
...to make that turn there.
And that's where they got him.

1222
01:18:27,752 --> 01:18:30,296
Who do you think changed
the parade route?

1223
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:33,383
Beats me. Secret Service,
city officials, Dallas Police.

1224
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:36,219
You know who was the mayor at the time?

1225
01:18:36,302 --> 01:18:37,470
Roy Cabell.

1226
01:18:37,845 --> 01:18:39,973
- Guess who his brother is?
- Who?

1227
01:18:40,848 --> 01:18:42,558
General Charles Cabell.

1228
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:44,894
Deputy director of the CIA.

1229
01:18:44,978 --> 01:18:48,147
Kennedy fired him in '61
because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

1230
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:52,443
Moved back to the Pentagon
and called Kennedy a traitor.

1231
01:18:52,735 --> 01:18:54,529
When he came to New Orleans...

1232
01:18:54,612 --> 01:18:58,658
...to address the Foreign Policy
Association, know who introduced him?

1233
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:00,952
Our friend, Clay Shaw.

1234
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:02,829
Didn't the Warren Commission call him?

1235
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:05,248
His boss was the one
on the Warren Commission...

1236
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:07,583
...who handled the leads
in the intelligence community.

1237
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:10,545
- Allen Dulles?
- Head of the CIA since '53.

1238
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:13,548
Kennedy fired them both.

1239
01:19:14,674 --> 01:19:17,260
Cabell was his Deputy for nine years.

1240
01:19:18,594 --> 01:19:21,514
Talk about the fox investigating
the chicken coop.

1241
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:25,685
Now, we'll have to subpoena them both.

1242
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:40,491
Clay Bertrand? Sure, I know him.

1243
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:42,201
Comes to the Quarter.

1244
01:19:42,368 --> 01:19:46,289
Who is he? I've been to all the bars.
Nobody wants to talk.

1245
01:19:47,665 --> 01:19:49,584
Why should they talk to you?

1246
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:54,589
I told your uncle, I never met a lawman
who wasn't a punk.

1247
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:01,763
A big-shot businessman.
I seen him on the TV news...

1248
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,931
...with all the other big shots.

1249
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:06,351
The guy's a fag, you know?

1250
01:20:06,809 --> 01:20:08,394
Goes by another name.

1251
01:20:08,686 --> 01:20:10,063
What name?

1252
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:11,898
Shaw.

1253
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:13,399
Clay Shaw.

1254
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:15,568
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?

1255
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:18,905
Guy who ran the International Trade Mart?

1256
01:20:19,405 --> 01:20:22,742
What's the mystery?
Everybody down here knows him.

1257
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:26,371
Then why does he call himself Bertrand?

1258
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,123
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?

1259
01:20:29,499 --> 01:20:33,169
Will you give us a little help
on that grand jury thing?

1260
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:35,755
I hope so. We could use it.

1261
01:20:36,172 --> 01:20:38,007
Your hunch was right, Boss.

1262
01:20:38,174 --> 01:20:40,176
But it's even spookier than we thought.

1263
01:20:40,259 --> 01:20:44,973
Starting in September '63 on,
two months before the assassination...

1264
01:20:45,223 --> 01:20:48,393
...there are sightings of Oswald
all over Dallas.

1265
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:53,106
Buying ammunition,
getting a telescopic sight fixed.

1266
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,066
Going to rifle ranges.

1267
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:59,237
Early November,
at a downtown Dallas Lincoln dealership...

1268
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,824
- ... he tells the salesman:
- Let's take it over for a test drive.

1269
01:21:02,907 --> 01:21:06,911
Despite the fact he has no license,
and doesn't know how to drive...

1270
01:21:07,203 --> 01:21:10,456
...he hits the curves like A.J. Foyt
at the Indy 500.

1271
01:21:10,623 --> 01:21:13,876
Beauregard later told his boss
that he drove like a madman.

1272
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:17,797
$300 down now, Mr. Oswald,
you can drive out of here.

1273
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:19,966
What? For this heap?

1274
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:25,013
No honest working man can afford to buy
a car in this goddamn country anymore.

1275
01:21:25,096 --> 01:21:27,307
Maybe I'll go to Russia and buy one.

1276
01:21:27,473 --> 01:21:31,311
Really dumb dialogue like he's trying
to draw attention to himself.

1277
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:38,401
Salesman remembers him as about 5'7",
but his draft card says he's actually 5'11".

1278
01:21:38,943 --> 01:21:42,780
Other witnesses see him on several
separate days at different firing ranges.

1279
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:45,241
One time, November 9...

1280
01:21:45,408 --> 01:21:48,828
...he decides to practice
on the next guy's target.

1281
01:21:48,911 --> 01:21:52,832
I didn't pay for a target
just to have you shoot at it!

1282
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,210
I'm sorry, buddy.

1283
01:21:57,128 --> 01:22:00,548
I thought I was shooting
at that son of a bitch Kennedy.

1284
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,926
As subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug.

1285
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:06,554
Then he shows up at Sylvia Odio's...

1286
01:22:06,929 --> 01:22:10,516
...a Cuban lady in Dallas
in the anti-Castro underground.

1287
01:22:10,683 --> 01:22:13,686
The two Cubans introduce him
as Leon Oswald.

1288
01:22:16,147 --> 01:22:18,191
Something about the man bothers her.

1289
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:21,110
48 hours later, one of the Cubans calls her.

1290
01:22:21,778 --> 01:22:23,988
What did you think of me
and Oswald last night?

1291
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:25,573
I don't care about Oswald.

1292
01:22:25,657 --> 01:22:29,160
You know what he said to us?
"Cubans don't have guts, 'cause Kennedy...

1293
01:22:29,243 --> 01:22:32,413
"... should have been killed
after the Bay of Pigs by a Cuban. "

1294
01:22:32,538 --> 01:22:36,042
It's like he's giving her information
she doesn't even ask for.

1295
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:38,378
She's scared and doesn't see him again...

1296
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:41,464
...till she sees Oswald's picture
in the paper.

1297
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,967
But the Warren Commission
says that Sylvia...

1298
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:47,804
...has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico...

1299
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:50,640
...trying to get back into Cuba.

1300
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:54,310
The CIA has a camera
outside the Cuban Embassy.

1301
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,271
And they say that this...

1302
01:22:57,313 --> 01:22:59,274
...is Oswald in Mexico.

1303
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,903
If this is Oswald,
it must be our third Oswald.

1304
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:08,616
The Warren Commission made great efforts
to make him a Communist.

1305
01:23:08,992 --> 01:23:13,746
I think the point of the Mexican episode
was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.

1306
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,709
If Oswald, or someone purporting
to be Oswald...

1307
01:23:17,834 --> 01:23:21,629
...had gotten into Cuba, come back,
and then killed the President...

1308
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,800
...the American public would've supported
a Cuban invasion.

1309
01:23:25,925 --> 01:23:28,845
I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.

1310
01:23:29,429 --> 01:23:32,432
This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.

1311
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:36,227
But Oswald told Capt. Fritz
that the photo was a fake.

1312
01:23:36,477 --> 01:23:37,854
This is not me!

1313
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:41,774
- That came from Janet Williams' garage.
- I never saw this picture.

1314
01:23:41,899 --> 01:23:46,613
It's my face but it's superimposed.
The rest is not me.

1315
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:49,907
I know photographic work.
That picture was made by someone else!

1316
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:52,577
I took this picture to two experts.

1317
01:23:53,286 --> 01:23:55,663
Look at how the shadows on the nose...

1318
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,416
...fall in a straight line,
like it's high noon.

1319
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:02,170
But the shadow on the ground is more
like late afternoon or early morning.

1320
01:24:02,295 --> 01:24:03,755
It's not the same time.

1321
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,215
And see the crop marks across the chin?

1322
01:24:06,424 --> 01:24:09,135
This head is pasted onto another body.

1323
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:12,013
Implicating him with the rifle and the gun.

1324
01:24:12,138 --> 01:24:15,308
Who the hell are you?
Alex Hidell or Lee Oswald?

1325
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,939
You're the policeman, you work it out.

1326
01:24:21,064 --> 01:24:23,733
Now it gets positively spooky.

1327
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:28,571
In January 1961, in New Orleans,
at the Bolton Ford dealership...

1328
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,741
...when the Oswald we know is in Russia...

1329
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:35,787
...there is a man using the name of Oswald
to buy trucks...

1330
01:24:35,954 --> 01:24:37,872
...for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.

1331
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:39,874
Salesman never sees him again.

1332
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:44,462
But who's on the Articles Of Incorporation
of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?

1333
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:46,714
Guy Banister.

1334
01:24:47,465 --> 01:24:51,135
Banister has someone using
the name Oswald to buy the trucks.

1335
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,598
Hoover at the FBI has a memo
dated June of 1960...

1336
01:24:56,307 --> 01:24:59,936
...that someone may be using
Oswald's passport and identity.

1337
01:25:00,186 --> 01:25:02,730
They created Oswald from day one.

1338
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:06,985
Like a dummy corporation in the Bahamas.
Just move him around a board.

1339
01:25:07,527 --> 01:25:09,195
Anybody want to quit?

1340
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:14,242
Dumb question. Put your hands down.

1341
01:25:15,952 --> 01:25:17,662
I found Clay Bertrand.

1342
01:25:18,788 --> 01:25:20,915
Grab your socks and hose and pull.

1343
01:25:21,374 --> 01:25:23,209
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw.

1344
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:27,380
- Director of the Trade Mart?
- Former director.

1345
01:25:27,588 --> 01:25:28,756
Incredible.

1346
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,259
Can you get some sworn statements?

1347
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:34,095
That'll be tough. Nobody's talking.

1348
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,265
Let's have him in for a chat.

1349
01:25:37,682 --> 01:25:39,684
I hate to get him dragged into this.

1350
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:43,229
He's done so much for the city,
restoring the Quarter.

1351
01:25:43,563 --> 01:25:47,483
Remember, we saw him at a fund-raiser.
Seems like such a nice man.

1352
01:25:47,817 --> 01:25:51,446
It'll be off the record.
I'll bring him in on a Sunday.

1353
01:25:53,323 --> 01:25:55,742
A quiet little chat between gentlemen.

1354
01:26:12,425 --> 01:26:14,177
In heavy fighting in Vietnam today...

1355
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,513
...seven more American soldiers died
and 23 wounded.

1356
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,600
The body count for this week
now stands at 67 Americans...

1357
01:26:20,683 --> 01:26:23,519
...and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action.

1358
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:28,358
President Johnson said he regretted
there's no end in sight to the war...

1359
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,527
...where 500,000 US troops
are now fighting.

1360
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,196
We face more cost...

1361
01:26:33,947 --> 01:26:35,198
...more loss...

1362
01:26:35,865 --> 01:26:37,283
...and more agony.

1363
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:40,036
Come hunt for Easter eggs.

1364
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:44,457
That's the kids' job. You know I don't like
these tribal rituals, anyway.

1365
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:47,710
I'm talking to Clay Shaw this morning.

1366
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,254
We're going to Antoine's with the kids!

1367
01:26:50,421 --> 01:26:52,590
I told you I was talking to Shaw.

1368
01:26:52,715 --> 01:26:55,176
In the middle of Easter Sunday?

1369
01:26:55,468 --> 01:26:58,638
When I scheduled it,
I didn't know it was a holiday.

1370
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:00,556
Look at the calendar!

1371
01:27:00,723 --> 01:27:03,059
You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

1372
01:27:03,643 --> 01:27:05,228
Clay Shaw is important.

1373
01:27:05,311 --> 01:27:07,605
- And we're not.
- I didn't say that.

1374
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,608
I didn't say that.

1375
01:27:11,484 --> 01:27:14,612
You're missing most of your life
and you don't know it.

1376
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,739
The kids are missing out, too.

1377
01:27:17,407 --> 01:27:21,786
- You're not the only one making sacrifices.
- I'll be there by 2:00, I promise.

1378
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,414
Just start without me.

1379
01:27:33,923 --> 01:27:36,592
Mr. Garrison, what can I do for you
on Easter Sunday?

1380
01:27:36,676 --> 01:27:38,928
I'm sorry to interrupt this holiday.

1381
01:27:39,262 --> 01:27:43,600
But this conversation is best kept out
of the everyday bustle of this office.

1382
01:27:43,933 --> 01:27:45,393
I don't understand.

1383
01:27:45,476 --> 01:27:49,397
In an investigation we're conducting,
your name keeps coming up.

1384
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:50,982
Can't imagine where.

1385
01:27:51,608 --> 01:27:54,736
We've talked to a number of men
who claim to know you.

1386
01:27:55,445 --> 01:27:57,238
Do you know a David Logan?

1387
01:27:57,363 --> 01:27:59,365
No. Never heard of him.

1388
01:28:00,283 --> 01:28:01,367
Perry Russo?

1389
01:28:01,451 --> 01:28:02,452
No.

1390
01:28:03,536 --> 01:28:05,121
Willie O'Keefe?

1391
01:28:06,539 --> 01:28:08,708
I don't know anyone by that name.

1392
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:13,129
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you
at the Masquerade Bar in the Quarter.

1393
01:28:14,047 --> 01:28:17,925
Then you had him over for dinner
at your apartment on Dauphine Street.

1394
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:20,845
- Do you recall that?
- I don't know this man.

1395
01:28:22,055 --> 01:28:23,556
Be still my heart.

1396
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:26,392
Obviously, I wouldn't have him over.

1397
01:28:26,476 --> 01:28:28,102
Hope you like squab.

1398
01:28:30,063 --> 01:28:31,272
Champagne?

1399
01:28:31,814 --> 01:28:36,277
Perhaps a few more details about
the evening will refresh your memory.

1400
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:46,621
Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served
by a uniformed waiter, a colored man.

1401
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:51,960
You sat at one end and he at the other,
which he found unusual...

1402
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:54,837
...because the table was so long.

1403
01:28:55,254 --> 01:28:56,589
How was your mousse?

1404
01:28:56,673 --> 01:28:59,008
Bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?

1405
01:28:59,092 --> 01:29:00,385
Not at all.

1406
01:29:01,094 --> 01:29:02,762
But I do have...

1407
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:05,265
...a lovely Chippendale dining table.

1408
01:29:05,515 --> 01:29:09,143
I often have a friend sit at one end
while I sit at the other.

1409
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:12,563
It's precisely the point
of a long dining table.

1410
01:29:13,231 --> 01:29:15,984
The splendor of the meal
adds to its enjoyment.

1411
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:18,361
I imagine a uniformed waiter helps.

1412
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:20,947
It adds elegance, for which I confess...

1413
01:29:21,197 --> 01:29:22,991
...a weakness now and then.

1414
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,993
I call him Smedley.

1415
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:30,331
His real name's Frankie Jenkins,
but it would be so uncouth during dinner...

1416
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:33,293
...to turn toward the kitchen and holler...

1417
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:34,877
..."Frankie! "

1418
01:29:39,882 --> 01:29:41,843
Where is all this leading to?

1419
01:29:42,218 --> 01:29:44,178
After dinner, you paid him to have sex.

1420
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,976
That is absolute nonsense.

1421
01:29:50,727 --> 01:29:54,897
The Quarter is filled
with vivid imaginations, dear Mr. Garrison.

1422
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:58,109
Grimy young hoodlums who will say
and do anything!

1423
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,236
Mr. O'Keefe told us...

1424
01:30:00,612 --> 01:30:03,906
...David Ferrie came to the house
with another young man.

1425
01:30:05,992 --> 01:30:07,785
- Who?
- David Ferrie.

1426
01:30:09,078 --> 01:30:10,747
I don't know that name.

1427
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:14,876
Never having met Mr. O'Keefe,
I couldn't have met Mr. Ferrie.

1428
01:30:28,473 --> 01:30:29,933
You're mine, Mary.

1429
01:30:30,808 --> 01:30:33,895
The four of you partied early
into the morning hours.

1430
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:35,563
Look at this picture.

1431
01:30:36,522 --> 01:30:39,400
I've never met anyone
of such bizarre appearance.

1432
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:52,038
Only way you get this,
you do exactly what I say. I'm the man.

1433
01:30:54,123 --> 01:30:56,334
You know the name Clay Bertrand?

1434
01:30:56,542 --> 01:30:57,835
Clay Bertrand.

1435
01:30:59,045 --> 01:31:02,465
A man with a similar name worked
at the Chamber of Commerce.

1436
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:05,301
- That the man you had in mind?
- No, it was not.

1437
01:31:06,302 --> 01:31:08,429
Can you identify this man?

1438
01:31:08,972 --> 01:31:12,767
Naturally. You claim Mr. Oswald
also had dinner with me?

1439
01:31:13,059 --> 01:31:15,687
Have you ever met Lee Harvey Oswald?

1440
01:31:16,312 --> 01:31:19,983
You have me consorting
with a sordid cast of characters.

1441
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,652
- Please answer the question.
- 'Course not.

1442
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:24,946
The assassination was such a pity.

1443
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:28,700
In fact I admired Kennedy.
Man of true panache.

1444
01:31:28,866 --> 01:31:30,702
Wife of impeccable taste.

1445
01:31:31,244 --> 01:31:34,455
Let's order without your daddy.
He won't mind.

1446
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:36,582
I want a Shirley Temple!

1447
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:38,960
Kids, put your water guns away.

1448
01:31:39,544 --> 01:31:41,129
When's Daddy coming?

1449
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:43,631
He's coming soon.

1450
01:31:43,923 --> 01:31:47,260
He's sorry he's late,
but he promised he'd be here.

1451
01:31:47,427 --> 01:31:49,929
Daddy never keeps his promises.

1452
01:31:54,225 --> 01:31:56,894
This Italian newspaper article says...

1453
01:31:57,562 --> 01:32:01,190
...you were a board member
of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy.

1454
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:05,612
This company was created by the CIA
for the transfer of funds in Italy...

1455
01:32:05,695 --> 01:32:08,448
...for illegal
political-espionage activities.

1456
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:12,619
Says that this company was expelled
from Italy for those activities.

1457
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:17,206
I'm well aware of that asinine article.
I'm thinking of suing that rag.

1458
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:21,210
It also says this company is linked
to the Schlumberger Tool Company...

1459
01:32:21,294 --> 01:32:25,131
...in Louisiana, which provided arms
to David Ferrie and his Cubans.

1460
01:32:25,298 --> 01:32:26,716
You're reaching.

1461
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:27,800
Am I?

1462
01:32:27,884 --> 01:32:31,471
I'm an international businessman.
The Trade Mart I founded...

1463
01:32:31,596 --> 01:32:35,725
...is America's commercial pipeline
to Latin America. I trade everywhere.

1464
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:39,938
Like all businessmen,
I am accused of all things.

1465
01:32:40,355 --> 01:32:44,567
I go about my business, make money,
help society the best I can...

1466
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:47,362
...and try to promote free trade
in this world.

1467
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:51,908
Have you ever been a contract agent
for the CIA?

1468
01:32:56,663 --> 01:32:58,039
And if I were...

1469
01:32:58,915 --> 01:33:02,293
...do you believe I would be here today...

1470
01:33:03,419 --> 01:33:05,505
...talking to somebody like you?

1471
01:33:11,177 --> 01:33:13,805
- People like you don't have to.
- May I go?

1472
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,557
People like you walk
between the raindrops.

1473
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:19,269
May I go?

1474
01:33:21,354 --> 01:33:22,230
Yes.

1475
01:33:30,697 --> 01:33:35,618
Regardless of what you may think of me,
I am a patriot first and foremost.

1476
01:33:35,702 --> 01:33:38,121
I've spent half my life in the military...

1477
01:33:38,204 --> 01:33:40,039
...defending my country.

1478
01:33:40,123 --> 01:33:44,335
You're the first person I've met who
considers it patriotic to kill the President.

1479
01:33:44,419 --> 01:33:46,296
You are way out of line.

1480
01:33:46,838 --> 01:33:50,174
It's getting late.
That's all the questions we have.

1481
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:53,261
Thank you for your honesty
and for coming in.

1482
01:33:53,344 --> 01:33:55,179
I enjoyed meeting with you.

1483
01:33:56,306 --> 01:33:59,267
And you, Miss Cox.
It's been most pleasant.

1484
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:09,110
I extend to you and your families
my best wishes for a happy Easter.

1485
01:34:18,411 --> 01:34:21,080
"One may smile, and smile
and be a villain. "

1486
01:34:22,415 --> 01:34:24,584
Goddamn it! We've got one of them.

1487
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:25,710
See that?

1488
01:34:43,019 --> 01:34:44,354
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1489
01:34:49,108 --> 01:34:50,318
Tough day.

1490
01:34:50,401 --> 01:34:51,986
Where you been?

1491
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:54,447
My sympathies.

1492
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,867
I'm sorry, the meeting
took much longer than expected.

1493
01:34:58,242 --> 01:34:59,744
Just a second.

1494
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:02,622
We waited for hours, Jim!

1495
01:35:04,207 --> 01:35:06,084
You could've telephoned.

1496
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:10,755
I can only say I'm sorry.
I just don't have rabbits on my mind.

1497
01:35:11,756 --> 01:35:13,341
You know what I think?

1498
01:35:13,424 --> 01:35:16,552
You care more about John Kennedy
than your own family.

1499
01:35:17,053 --> 01:35:20,974
All day the kids asked, "Where's Daddy?"
What should I tell them?

1500
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:23,268
I don't know!

1501
01:35:23,559 --> 01:35:26,562
The truth! I'm doing my job
to make sure they grow up...

1502
01:35:26,646 --> 01:35:30,817
...in a country where justice won't be
a vanished idea in history books...

1503
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:33,111
...like dinosaurs or Atlantis.

1504
01:35:33,236 --> 01:35:36,197
It doesn't replace a husband
or a father on Easter Sunday.

1505
01:35:36,281 --> 01:35:38,116
It's going to get worse!

1506
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,249
I beat you again, you must give me a raise.

1507
01:35:46,332 --> 01:35:48,459
Who can you brag to?

1508
01:35:50,837 --> 01:35:54,173
Who killed President Kennedy?
Was there a conspiracy here?

1509
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:56,801
I don't know what you're talking about.

1510
01:35:57,677 --> 01:36:00,221
Clear the door! Watch out! Move!

1511
01:36:02,974 --> 01:36:05,226
Congratulations. You're Page One.

1512
01:36:05,393 --> 01:36:10,773
Ain't nice, it says, we've spent over $8,000
on unexplained investigative expenses...

1513
01:36:10,857 --> 01:36:12,567
...since November, 1966.

1514
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:13,901
Goddamn!

1515
01:36:14,193 --> 01:36:18,364
They went to the public records, got
vouchers we requested for withdrawals.

1516
01:36:18,615 --> 01:36:20,366
Shaw got them on our tail.

1517
01:36:20,533 --> 01:36:23,620
It could have been Ferrie,
Martin, Andrews, any of them.

1518
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:27,498
Or they talked to Ruby 'cause of
they're on our asses for a measly $8,000.

1519
01:36:27,582 --> 01:36:29,751
They're hunting the news,
it's their business.

1520
01:36:29,834 --> 01:36:32,545
You'd think they'd understand
what were doing.

1521
01:36:32,795 --> 01:36:35,590
Getting angry doesn't accomplish
a damn thing.

1522
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:39,177
Son of a bitch.

1523
01:36:39,886 --> 01:36:42,096
This changes everything now.

1524
01:36:42,597 --> 01:36:43,973
What do you mean?

1525
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:50,021
Either we pull out now
or we go through heavy flak together.

1526
01:36:52,899 --> 01:36:56,819
Bear in mind, this may affect
the rest of your careers, your lives.

1527
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,323
Any one who wants to pull out now...

1528
01:37:00,615 --> 01:37:05,828
...I assure you there will be no ill feelings
and I will reassign you to regular duties.

1529
01:37:09,499 --> 01:37:11,709
There it is then, thank you.

1530
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:14,128
It means a great deal to me.

1531
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:20,802
I'm giving this office $6,000
from my National Guard savings account.

1532
01:37:21,886 --> 01:37:23,346
So we can continue.

1533
01:37:24,097 --> 01:37:27,350
I'll make speeches where I can
and make additional money.

1534
01:37:27,892 --> 01:37:30,895
What shall I tell them?
Their piling up outside the door.

1535
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:33,773
They want a statement.
The phones are going crazy.

1536
01:37:33,856 --> 01:37:36,818
I won't confirm, deny nor discuss, Sharon.

1537
01:37:38,444 --> 01:37:40,405
Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.

1538
01:37:42,448 --> 01:37:45,285
I'm going home
to get a decent day's work done.

1539
01:37:45,368 --> 01:37:49,205
Mr. Garrison's own silence on the subject
has raised some interesting questions.

1540
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:53,001
With taxpayer money,
has he uncovered valuable new evidence?

1541
01:37:53,418 --> 01:37:58,214
Or is he merely saving the information
to gain exposure at a national level?

1542
01:37:58,423 --> 01:38:01,342
Mr. Garrison should have
some explanation.

1543
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:03,970
Did your office plant that garbage
in the paper?

1544
01:38:04,053 --> 01:38:06,014
- Who is this?
- You know damn well.

1545
01:38:06,139 --> 01:38:08,099
- Dave?
- You got it. Listen.

1546
01:38:08,391 --> 01:38:10,435
You're the only straight-shooter there.

1547
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,520
I want an answer! Did you plant it?

1548
01:38:12,604 --> 01:38:16,190
Do you think we're nuts?
It's been a zoo since that broke.

1549
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:18,735
Reporters everywhere.
Do you think we want that?

1550
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:21,613
Somebody planted that fucking story!

1551
01:38:21,696 --> 01:38:25,366
I'm one of fucking Garrison's suspects.
I can't go home!

1552
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:28,620
The maggots are everywhere!
Do you know what you've done to me?

1553
01:38:28,703 --> 01:38:30,038
Calm down.

1554
01:38:30,121 --> 01:38:31,331
From here on...

1555
01:38:31,581 --> 01:38:33,458
...I'm a fucking dead man!

1556
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:36,377
You weren't even mentioned in the story.

1557
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:40,340
Meet me in the lobby
of the Fontainebleau in 20 minutes.

1558
01:38:40,923 --> 01:38:45,386
I guarantee the boss will protect you.
He likes you. He likes your mind.

1559
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:52,560
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

1560
01:38:52,685 --> 01:38:56,981
I suppose I could use a pot of hot coffee
and a few packs of Luckys.

1561
01:38:58,483 --> 01:38:59,692
Anything new?

1562
01:39:00,109 --> 01:39:01,903
Who are you scared of?

1563
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,656
Everybody. The Agency, mob, Cubans.

1564
01:39:06,074 --> 01:39:07,367
Follow the Cubans.

1565
01:39:07,492 --> 01:39:10,411
Check them out. Here, in Miami. Dallas.

1566
01:39:11,871 --> 01:39:14,123
Check out Eladio del Valle.

1567
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:17,627
He was my paymaster
when I flew missions into Cuba.

1568
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:21,631
You're on the right track.
Don't write this down!

1569
01:39:21,965 --> 01:39:24,259
I ain't cooperating with no one!

1570
01:39:24,759 --> 01:39:27,595
There's a death warrant for me!
Don't you get it?

1571
01:39:28,054 --> 01:39:29,931
Damn! Wait a minute!

1572
01:39:30,014 --> 01:39:32,850
You ain't bugged, are you?
Son of a bitch, Lou!

1573
01:39:33,268 --> 01:39:34,352
Are you?

1574
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:36,437
I play square. No bugs.

1575
01:39:36,813 --> 01:39:40,358
I'd love you to go on the record,
but I'm in no hurry.

1576
01:39:40,817 --> 01:39:42,902
I haven't slept since that article.

1577
01:39:43,027 --> 01:39:46,990
- Why'd you get me involved?
- Did we involve you? Or did Shaw?

1578
01:39:47,573 --> 01:39:50,493
Cocksucking faggot.
He got me by the balls.

1579
01:39:50,785 --> 01:39:53,788
- What do you mean?
- Photographs, compromising stuff.

1580
01:39:54,247 --> 01:39:55,415
He'll use them, too.

1581
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,166
Agency plays for keeps.

1582
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:01,129
Oswald was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.
I taught him everything.

1583
01:40:01,838 --> 01:40:05,300
He was a wannabe. No one liked him.
Thought he was a snitch.

1584
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:07,010
But I treated him good.

1585
01:40:07,093 --> 01:40:10,013
He wanted his kid to grow up
with a chance.

1586
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,640
What's this? What's going on?

1587
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:16,144
Don't let him in.

1588
01:40:16,269 --> 01:40:18,062
No one's coming in here.

1589
01:40:21,608 --> 01:40:22,859
Black. Give it to me.

1590
01:40:22,984 --> 01:40:25,528
Black. My neck is killing me.

1591
01:40:26,404 --> 01:40:30,283
I've had cancer for years.
Been working with mice to find a cure.

1592
01:40:30,742 --> 01:40:32,452
Did you work for the CIA?

1593
01:40:33,411 --> 01:40:36,748
You sound like it's a remote experience
in ancient history.

1594
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:38,916
You don't leave the Agency.

1595
01:40:40,084 --> 01:40:43,129
- Once you're in, they got you for life.
- And Shaw?

1596
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:46,341
Shaw's an untouchable. Highest clearance.

1597
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:49,344
Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans, all Agency.

1598
01:40:50,762 --> 01:40:51,679
Ruby?

1599
01:40:55,808 --> 01:40:58,686
Jack was a pimp.
A bagman for the Dallas mob.

1600
01:40:59,062 --> 01:41:01,648
Ran guns to Castro
when he was on our side.

1601
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:04,525
Castro was almost with us
till we tried to whack him.

1602
01:41:04,609 --> 01:41:06,611
Everybody keeps flipping sides.

1603
01:41:06,694 --> 01:41:08,279
It's fun and games.

1604
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:11,908
- How do the mob figure in this?
- They're Agency too.

1605
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:17,372
The CIA and the Mafia worked together
for years trying to whack out the beard.

1606
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:20,166
There's more to this than you could dream!

1607
01:41:20,249 --> 01:41:23,503
Check out something called
"Operation Mongoose. "

1608
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,131
Government, Pentagon stuff.
They're in charge.

1609
01:41:27,632 --> 01:41:30,343
But who pulls whose chain? Who knows?

1610
01:41:31,135 --> 01:41:34,222
"Oh, what a deadly web we weave
when we practice to deceive. "

1611
01:41:34,305 --> 01:41:35,890
Who killed the President?

1612
01:41:35,974 --> 01:41:38,685
Why don't you fucking stop it? Shit!

1613
01:41:39,978 --> 01:41:42,647
This is too big for you, you know that?

1614
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:47,235
Who did the President? Fuck!
It's a mystery.

1615
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:50,321
It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle
inside an enigma!

1616
01:41:50,405 --> 01:41:53,408
The shooters don't even know!
Don't you get it?

1617
01:41:53,533 --> 01:41:56,411
Fuck, man! I can't keep talking like this!

1618
01:41:56,703 --> 01:41:58,663
They'll fucking kill me!

1619
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,540
I'll fucking die!

1620
01:42:04,836 --> 01:42:06,254
Son of a bitch!

1621
01:42:06,337 --> 01:42:07,880
It's all right.

1622
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:11,593
I don't know what happened.

1623
01:42:12,343 --> 01:42:13,511
Fuck!

1624
01:42:20,184 --> 01:42:22,437
All I wanted in the world...

1625
01:42:24,689 --> 01:42:26,858
...was to be a Catholic priest.

1626
01:42:28,026 --> 01:42:29,694
Live in a monastery.

1627
01:42:29,861 --> 01:42:31,237
Pray. Serve God.

1628
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:34,073
I had...

1629
01:42:36,492 --> 01:42:38,995
...one terrible fucking weakness.

1630
01:42:39,746 --> 01:42:41,539
And they defrocked me!

1631
01:42:45,752 --> 01:42:48,212
Then I started to lose everything.

1632
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:51,716
You'll be okay, Dave.

1633
01:42:52,008 --> 01:42:55,094
Just talk to us on the record.
We'll protect you.

1634
01:43:01,392 --> 01:43:03,186
They'll get to you too.

1635
01:43:04,604 --> 01:43:06,147
They'll destroy you.

1636
01:43:08,066 --> 01:43:09,609
They're untouchable.

1637
01:43:13,237 --> 01:43:16,407
I'm so fucking exhausted,
I can't see straight.

1638
01:43:31,547 --> 01:43:33,424
Early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?

1639
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:36,177
Paris Match,
the largest magazine in France.

1640
01:43:37,053 --> 01:43:39,138
Literaturnaya Gazeta from Moscow.

1641
01:43:39,222 --> 01:43:41,266
Victoria Taylor, Private Eye.

1642
01:43:42,225 --> 01:43:45,270
You know who shot the President?
Mr. Garrison is too busy...

1643
01:43:45,353 --> 01:43:47,939
They're putting the heat on David Ferrie.

1644
01:43:48,648 --> 01:43:51,067
If we wait, he won't hold on.

1645
01:43:53,027 --> 01:43:57,115
He keeps changing his story.
We can't call him to a grand jury.

1646
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:02,495
He'll keep deteriorating.
We'll get more out of him when he cracks.

1647
01:44:03,579 --> 01:44:07,375
If we call him in now he might freeze up,
we'll lose our best shot.

1648
01:44:07,959 --> 01:44:11,629
He can't go down any further.
We must protect him full time.

1649
01:44:12,672 --> 01:44:15,341
I know what you're going through
with Ferrie.

1650
01:44:15,675 --> 01:44:19,929
We'll talk tomorrow.
I have to catch a plane to Washington.

1651
01:44:21,764 --> 01:44:25,184
A lead says he's closely connected
to these events...

1652
01:44:25,518 --> 01:44:27,061
...but he won't come here.

1653
01:44:27,145 --> 01:44:30,273
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,
Eladio del Valle.

1654
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:33,443
I need more men. I got to get him in.

1655
01:44:33,526 --> 01:44:36,863
I can't pull the teams to watch Ferrie.
I promised him!

1656
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:38,740
This is our case!

1657
01:44:42,076 --> 01:44:43,995
I got something to show you.

1658
01:44:44,329 --> 01:44:46,914
I think you'll find it interesting.

1659
01:44:49,667 --> 01:44:51,502
This was found in your office.

1660
01:44:51,586 --> 01:44:55,423
The conference room is bugged, maybe
the phones. We have to debug the place.

1661
01:44:55,506 --> 01:44:58,509
Bugging the DA's office.
This is outrageous!

1662
01:45:00,053 --> 01:45:02,639
Believe what you want,
but we must be more careful.

1663
01:45:02,722 --> 01:45:04,807
All these new volunteers!

1664
01:45:06,017 --> 01:45:09,771
You handle it, okay?
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1665
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:15,443
Well, we obviously got
the bastards worried now.

1666
01:45:18,363 --> 01:45:20,448
I'm coming to Washington!

1667
01:45:25,954 --> 01:45:27,747
Dave Ferrie's dead.

1668
01:45:28,373 --> 01:45:31,042
Found his body in his apartment
two hours ago.

1669
01:45:56,359 --> 01:45:57,735
What's it look like?

1670
01:45:57,819 --> 01:46:02,490
I don't see any violence. Heart attack,
maybe an aneurysm. Natural causes.

1671
01:46:02,573 --> 01:46:05,410
This is addressed to no one
and no signature.

1672
01:46:05,702 --> 01:46:08,579
"To leave this life is
for me a sweet prospect.

1673
01:46:08,871 --> 01:46:11,249
"I find nothing in it that is desirable...

1674
01:46:11,332 --> 01:46:14,585
"... and, on the other hand,
everything that is loathsome. "

1675
01:46:14,669 --> 01:46:16,379
It goes on and on.

1676
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:21,009
"Daily we are propagandized more
and more by the rising crime wave. "

1677
01:46:21,593 --> 01:46:24,095
Seems pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

1678
01:46:45,116 --> 01:46:46,159
Proloid.

1679
01:46:48,745 --> 01:46:51,623
I took it once for a low thyroid condition.

1680
01:46:52,332 --> 01:46:54,250
It raises the metabolism.

1681
01:46:55,752 --> 01:46:59,297
Ferrie strike you as the kind of person
with a low metabolism?

1682
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:02,675
Hardly, I'd say the opposite.
Maybe hypertension.

1683
01:47:03,384 --> 01:47:08,222
Ferrie was the only one to express
any kind of remorse about the whole thing.

1684
01:47:09,807 --> 01:47:11,601
I think it got him killed.

1685
01:47:13,603 --> 01:47:15,313
More bad news from Miami.

1686
01:47:15,521 --> 01:47:18,274
Ferrie's friend, Eladio del Valle,
was found...

1687
01:47:19,233 --> 01:47:21,736
...hacked to death with a machete
in his car.

1688
01:47:21,819 --> 01:47:26,783
He was tortured, shot point-blank in
the heart, his skull split open with an ax.

1689
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,743
Ain't that the devil's piss!

1690
01:47:28,826 --> 01:47:32,038
Found another note. Same thing.
No name. No signature.

1691
01:47:32,372 --> 01:47:36,793
"When you receive this, I'll be quite dead,
so no answer is possible.

1692
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:41,965
- "I offered you love, I got kicked. "
- Must've pressed to come up with that.

1693
01:47:44,217 --> 01:47:48,846
What if a man with hypertension
were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

1694
01:47:49,305 --> 01:47:53,935
He'd die quickly. A heart storm
or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

1695
01:47:54,644 --> 01:47:57,647
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid
in his system?

1696
01:47:57,814 --> 01:47:59,607
Not with a routine autopsy.

1697
01:47:59,774 --> 01:48:03,194
But there may be a high level of iodine
in the spinal fluid.

1698
01:48:03,278 --> 01:48:06,281
But it's difficult to know.
What're you thinking?

1699
01:48:08,032 --> 01:48:11,494
It doesn't make sense.
Would a man afraid of dying...

1700
01:48:11,911 --> 01:48:14,664
...kill himself in a way
that leaves no trace?

1701
01:48:15,832 --> 01:48:18,334
And leave two unsigned suicide notes?

1702
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,671
If it's a suicide, I've seen weirder.

1703
01:48:22,547 --> 01:48:25,633
The fact is, he's gone. And so is our case.

1704
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,343
Unless we go for Shaw now.

1705
01:48:27,427 --> 01:48:30,722
With whose testimony?
O'Keefe, a male prostitute?

1706
01:48:31,389 --> 01:48:34,392
Jack Martin, a drunk?
Vernon Bundy, a dope fiend?

1707
01:48:34,517 --> 01:48:38,396
Shaw's got respect. Newspaper editors,
American Bar Association.

1708
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:42,066
- I agree. We don't have the goods.
- We wait, Shaw will get whacked!

1709
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:45,069
How many corpses do you need
to figure out what's going on?

1710
01:48:45,153 --> 01:48:47,780
Watch your mouth! Ferrie did this himself.

1711
01:48:48,823 --> 01:48:50,283
Where're you going?

1712
01:48:50,366 --> 01:48:51,701
I don't know.

1713
01:48:51,909 --> 01:48:53,620
I just don't know.

1714
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:01,419
Frank, you're wasting your time here.

1715
01:49:01,502 --> 01:49:03,880
Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBl.

1716
01:49:04,172 --> 01:49:05,840
It's you I want to talk to.

1717
01:49:05,924 --> 01:49:08,551
Boss'd fry me in hog fat
if he knew I talked to you.

1718
01:49:08,635 --> 01:49:11,054
Boss's got a problem. Real serious.

1719
01:49:11,387 --> 01:49:14,682
- We know what's going on at your office.
- I guess you do.

1720
01:49:14,807 --> 01:49:18,770
You got nothing. I'm a friend.
You're riding on the Titanic.

1721
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,773
Time to jump off
before you get destroyed, too.

1722
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:23,232
Enough!

1723
01:49:23,316 --> 01:49:26,444
We're talking about your career.
You're young.

1724
01:49:27,362 --> 01:49:29,197
You're working the Castro thing.

1725
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,782
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

1726
01:49:30,865 --> 01:49:34,327
We know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.
Castro did.

1727
01:49:34,911 --> 01:49:36,996
If it comes out, there'll be a war.

1728
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:41,501
Millions of people will die.
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

1729
01:49:41,751 --> 01:49:44,879
Look at me when I talk to you!
You're too selfish!

1730
01:49:45,171 --> 01:49:46,464
Shut up!

1731
01:49:47,048 --> 01:49:51,261
If you got a brain in your thick skull,
listen to me. Listen real hard.

1732
01:49:52,428 --> 01:49:53,721
Get in the car.

1733
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,911
Garrison?

1734
01:50:18,121 --> 01:50:18,997
Yes.

1735
01:50:20,206 --> 01:50:21,541
Glad you came.

1736
01:50:21,958 --> 01:50:23,876
Sorry about the precautions.

1737
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,462
I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...?

1738
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:31,384
I could give you a false name,
but I won't. Call me "X."

1739
01:50:32,927 --> 01:50:37,390
I've already been warned by the Agency,
so, if this is another threat-

1740
01:50:37,974 --> 01:50:40,310
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison.

1741
01:50:41,185 --> 01:50:44,981
If you've come this far,
what I have to say interests you.

1742
01:50:45,148 --> 01:50:48,318
I won't name names or tell you who
or what I represent.

1743
01:50:49,110 --> 01:50:50,903
Except to say you're close.

1744
01:50:52,238 --> 01:50:53,906
Closer than you think.

1745
01:50:57,619 --> 01:51:00,747
Everything I'll say
is classified top secret.

1746
01:51:01,247 --> 01:51:04,167
I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars.

1747
01:51:05,251 --> 01:51:09,172
A secret Pentagon guy,
supplying the hardware:

1748
01:51:09,255 --> 01:51:11,090
Planes, bullets, rifles...

1749
01:51:11,424 --> 01:51:13,843
...for what we call "Black Operations. "

1750
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,763
Black Ops. Assassinations. Coups d'etat...

1751
01:51:16,846 --> 01:51:19,682
...rigging elections,
propaganda, psych warfare.

1752
01:51:20,808 --> 01:51:24,395
In World War ll, I was in Romania,
Greece, Yugoslavia.

1753
01:51:24,771 --> 01:51:29,025
I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence
at the end of the war.

1754
01:51:29,442 --> 01:51:32,153
And we used those guys
against the Communists.

1755
01:51:32,528 --> 01:51:34,864
In Italy, '48, we stole the elections.

1756
01:51:34,948 --> 01:51:37,367
France '49, we broke the strikes.

1757
01:51:37,742 --> 01:51:40,745
Overthrew Quirino in the Philippines,
Arbenz in Guatemala...

1758
01:51:40,828 --> 01:51:43,748
...Mossadegh in Iran.
We were in Vietnam in '54...

1759
01:51:44,415 --> 01:51:46,626
...Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.

1760
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:50,588
Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.

1761
01:51:51,714 --> 01:51:53,049
Very good.

1762
01:51:54,008 --> 01:51:56,719
Then we got into the Cuban thing.
Not so good.

1763
01:51:56,886 --> 01:52:00,181
Set up an invasion to take place
in October, '62.

1764
01:52:00,848 --> 01:52:04,185
Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.
Kennedy didn't invade.

1765
01:52:04,769 --> 01:52:07,313
We just had our dicks in the wind.

1766
01:52:07,397 --> 01:52:09,941
A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.

1767
01:52:10,566 --> 01:52:11,734
Understand?

1768
01:52:12,277 --> 01:52:13,987
I'll come to that later.

1769
01:52:14,404 --> 01:52:16,281
So, 1963...

1770
01:52:17,365 --> 01:52:19,951
I spent much of September of '63...

1771
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:23,371
...working on the Kennedy plan
to get all US personnel...

1772
01:52:23,454 --> 01:52:26,165
...out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.

1773
01:52:26,749 --> 01:52:30,503
One of the strongest plans issued
by the Kennedy White House...

1774
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:33,673
...National Security Memo 263...

1775
01:52:33,965 --> 01:52:36,175
...ordered home the first 1,000 troops.

1776
01:52:37,051 --> 01:52:41,431
But in November, a week after the murder
of Vietnamese President Diem...

1777
01:52:41,514 --> 01:52:44,183
...and two weeks before
Kennedy's assassination...

1778
01:52:44,267 --> 01:52:46,644
...a strange thing happened to me.

1779
01:52:49,105 --> 01:52:50,815
Is Dave in there?

1780
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:57,822
You wanted to see me, General?

1781
01:52:58,197 --> 01:52:59,449
I do, indeed.

1782
01:52:59,866 --> 01:53:01,909
You're going to the South Pole.

1783
01:53:02,577 --> 01:53:03,578
I am?

1784
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:06,122
Dr. Mooney's got the details.

1785
01:53:06,205 --> 01:53:08,958
Check with him. Have a nice vacation.

1786
01:53:09,626 --> 01:53:12,587
I was sent by my superior,
we'll call him "Y"...

1787
01:53:13,004 --> 01:53:15,715
...I was sent by General Y
to the South Pole...

1788
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:20,094
...as military escort for a group
of international VIPs.

1789
01:53:20,595 --> 01:53:23,389
I was on my way back, in New Zealand...

1790
01:53:24,223 --> 01:53:26,184
...when the President was killed.

1791
01:53:28,227 --> 01:53:31,648
Oswald was charged at 7:00 p. m,
Dallas time...

1792
01:53:32,148 --> 01:53:36,444
...with Tippit's murder. That's 2:00 p. m.
the next day in New Zealand.

1793
01:53:37,278 --> 01:53:40,198
But already their papers
had the entire history...

1794
01:53:40,281 --> 01:53:42,951
...of this unknown, 24-year-old Oswald.

1795
01:53:43,368 --> 01:53:46,621
Studio picture, detailed biography,
Russian information...

1796
01:53:46,704 --> 01:53:49,749
...and were sure that he killed
the President alone...

1797
01:53:49,832 --> 01:53:54,128
...although it took them four more hours
to charge him with that crime in Dallas.

1798
01:53:56,547 --> 01:53:58,216
It felt to me as if...

1799
01:53:59,467 --> 01:54:01,678
...a cover story was being put out.

1800
01:54:01,886 --> 01:54:03,805
Like we would in a Black Op.

1801
01:54:05,598 --> 01:54:07,141
After I came back...

1802
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:10,895
...I asked myself, why was I,
the chief of Special Ops...

1803
01:54:11,062 --> 01:54:13,898
...sent to the South Pole to do a job...

1804
01:54:14,357 --> 01:54:16,276
...many others could have done?

1805
01:54:16,359 --> 01:54:18,528
I wondered if it could've been because...

1806
01:54:18,611 --> 01:54:21,155
...a routine duty,
if I'd been in Washington...

1807
01:54:21,239 --> 01:54:24,033
...would've been to order
additional security in Texas.

1808
01:54:24,117 --> 01:54:27,662
I checked it out and found that someone...

1809
01:54:27,745 --> 01:54:32,500
...told the 112th Military Intelligence
Group at Fort Sam Houston...

1810
01:54:32,709 --> 01:54:36,629
...to stand down that day,
over the protests of Colonel Reich.

1811
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:39,382
I believe it's a mistake.

1812
01:54:39,591 --> 01:54:44,721
It's standard procedure, especially
in a known hostile city like Dallas...

1813
01:54:44,846 --> 01:54:46,973
...to supplement the Secret Service.

1814
01:54:47,056 --> 01:54:50,351
Even if we hadn't let him ride
with the bubble-top off...

1815
01:54:50,852 --> 01:54:54,814
...we would've put 100 to 200 agents
on the sidewalk without question.

1816
01:54:55,398 --> 01:54:59,736
A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.

1817
01:54:59,902 --> 01:55:02,822
There had been attempts
on De Gaulle's life in France.

1818
01:55:02,905 --> 01:55:05,700
We'd have arrived days ahead,
studied the route...

1819
01:55:05,783 --> 01:55:07,243
...checked all buildings.

1820
01:55:07,327 --> 01:55:10,330
Never would've allowed open windows
overlooking Dealey.

1821
01:55:10,496 --> 01:55:12,624
Our own snipers
would've covered the area.

1822
01:55:12,749 --> 01:55:15,335
If a window went up,
they'd have been on the radio!

1823
01:55:15,418 --> 01:55:18,796
We'd be watching the crowd:
packages, rolled-up newspapers, coats.

1824
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,215
Never would've let a man
open an umbrella.

1825
01:55:21,382 --> 01:55:24,260
Never would've let the car slow down
to ten miles an hour.

1826
01:55:24,344 --> 01:55:27,096
Or take that unusual curve
at Houston and Elm.

1827
01:55:27,722 --> 01:55:31,017
You'd have felt an Army presence
in the streets that day.

1828
01:55:31,267 --> 01:55:35,855
But none of this happened. It violated
our most basic protection codes.

1829
01:55:36,272 --> 01:55:40,068
And it is the best indication
of a massive plot in Dallas.

1830
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:43,404
Who could have best done this?

1831
01:55:43,571 --> 01:55:48,868
Black Ops. People in my business.
My superior might call Col. Reich and say:

1832
01:55:48,993 --> 01:55:52,997
"We have another unit coming for security.
You'll stand down. "

1833
01:55:53,873 --> 01:55:57,043
That day, some Army intelligence people
were in Dallas.

1834
01:55:57,377 --> 01:55:59,045
I don't know who or why.

1835
01:55:59,504 --> 01:56:01,339
But they weren't protecting clients.

1836
01:56:01,422 --> 01:56:04,717
And Oswald. Army Intell had
a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.

1837
01:56:06,344 --> 01:56:08,471
Those files have been destroyed.

1838
01:56:08,805 --> 01:56:13,309
Many strange things were happening.
Oswald had nothing to do with them.

1839
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:17,689
The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.

1840
01:56:17,772 --> 01:56:20,942
A third of a combat division
was returning from Germany...

1841
01:56:21,025 --> 01:56:24,821
...in the air above the United States,
at the time of the shooting.

1842
01:56:24,988 --> 01:56:30,159
At 12:34 p. m, the Washington
telephone system went out for an hour.

1843
01:56:30,576 --> 01:56:32,620
On the plane back to Washington...

1844
01:56:32,704 --> 01:56:35,039
...word was radioed
from the Situations Room...

1845
01:56:35,123 --> 01:56:39,627
...to Johnson that there was one assassin.
Sound like coincidences to you?

1846
01:56:41,296 --> 01:56:42,797
Not for one moment.

1847
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:45,758
The Cabinet was out of the way.

1848
01:56:46,718 --> 01:56:48,845
Troops for riot control were in the air.

1849
01:56:48,928 --> 01:56:52,432
Telephones were out to stop
the wrong stories from spreading.

1850
01:56:53,141 --> 01:56:54,684
Nothing was left to chance.

1851
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:57,895
He could not be allowed to escape alive.

1852
01:57:01,024 --> 01:57:03,401
Things were never the same after that.

1853
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:07,697
Vietnam started for real.
There was an air of...

1854
01:57:08,906 --> 01:57:11,242
...make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.

1855
01:57:11,326 --> 01:57:15,496
Those of us in Secret Ops knew
the Warren Commission was fiction.

1856
01:57:16,164 --> 01:57:17,957
But there was something...

1857
01:57:18,249 --> 01:57:19,417
...deeper.

1858
01:57:19,792 --> 01:57:20,752
Uglier.

1859
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,255
I knew Allen Dulles well.
I often briefed him in his house.

1860
01:57:24,339 --> 01:57:29,552
But why was he appointed to investigate
Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.

1861
01:57:30,219 --> 01:57:33,389
Dulles, by the way,
was General Y's benefactor.

1862
01:57:35,558 --> 01:57:37,268
I got out in '64.

1863
01:57:38,102 --> 01:57:39,812
Resigned my commission.

1864
01:57:41,481 --> 01:57:45,109
I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous
to the establishment.

1865
01:57:46,194 --> 01:57:47,654
Is that why?

1866
01:57:48,154 --> 01:57:50,823
That's the real question, isn't it? Why?

1867
01:57:51,282 --> 01:57:54,702
The how and the who is just scenery
for the public.

1868
01:57:55,536 --> 01:57:58,373
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia...

1869
01:57:58,998 --> 01:58:00,959
...keeps them guessing, like a game.

1870
01:58:01,042 --> 01:58:04,254
Prevents them from asking
the most important question: why?

1871
01:58:04,337 --> 01:58:07,131
Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?

1872
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:10,760
Who has the power to cover it up? Who?

1873
01:58:14,347 --> 01:58:15,682
In 1961...

1874
01:58:17,267 --> 01:58:20,853
...right after the Bay of Pigs,
very few people know this...

1875
01:58:21,271 --> 01:58:25,900
...I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 57.

1876
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:29,195
These are documents classified top secret.

1877
01:58:29,696 --> 01:58:33,533
In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

1878
01:58:33,616 --> 01:58:37,704
...that from here on, the Joint Chiefs
would be wholly responsible...

1879
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:40,873
...for all covert paramilitary action
in peacetime.

1880
01:58:41,457 --> 01:58:43,501
This ended the reign of the CIA.

1881
01:58:44,043 --> 01:58:47,547
Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,
as JFK promised he would.

1882
01:58:47,797 --> 01:58:50,008
And now he was ordering the military...

1883
01:58:50,133 --> 01:58:52,427
...to help him do it. Unprecedented!

1884
01:58:52,552 --> 01:58:57,098
I can't tell you the shock waves this sent
along the corridors of power.

1885
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:59,434
This and the firing of Allen Dulles...

1886
01:58:59,559 --> 01:59:01,936
...Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.

1887
01:59:02,061 --> 01:59:05,398
All were sacred cows in Intell
since World War ll.

1888
01:59:05,857 --> 01:59:07,984
They got some very upset people.

1889
01:59:09,068 --> 01:59:12,071
Kennedy's directives weren't implemented
because of...

1890
01:59:12,155 --> 01:59:14,282
...bureaucratic resistance.

1891
01:59:15,158 --> 01:59:17,118
But one of the results was...

1892
01:59:17,452 --> 01:59:20,955
...the Cuban operation was turned over
to my department...

1893
01:59:21,664 --> 01:59:23,708
...as Operation Mongoose.

1894
01:59:24,208 --> 01:59:26,419
Mongoose was pure Black Ops.

1895
01:59:26,836 --> 01:59:29,923
It was secretly based at Miami University...

1896
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:33,176
...which has the largest
domestic CIA station...

1897
01:59:33,509 --> 01:59:36,512
...budgeted annually for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

1898
01:59:36,638 --> 01:59:39,182
Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.

1899
01:59:40,058 --> 01:59:42,727
Fifty fake business fronts
to launder money.

1900
01:59:42,936 --> 01:59:45,480
They waged a non-stop war against Castro.

1901
01:59:45,813 --> 01:59:48,191
Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.

1902
01:59:48,691 --> 01:59:50,818
All under the control of General Y.

1903
01:59:51,611 --> 01:59:54,280
He took the rules of covert warfare
he'd used abroad...

1904
01:59:54,405 --> 01:59:56,282
...and brought them to this country.

1905
01:59:56,366 --> 01:59:59,118
Now he had the people,
the equipment, the bases...

1906
01:59:59,202 --> 02:00:00,828
...and the motivation.

1907
02:00:01,037 --> 02:00:05,333
Don't underestimate the budget cuts
that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.

1908
02:00:05,792 --> 02:00:08,544
Nearly 52 military installations
in 25 states.

1909
02:00:08,878 --> 02:00:10,588
Twenty-one overseas bases.

1910
02:00:11,214 --> 02:00:12,590
Big money.

1911
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:16,010
You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?

1912
02:00:17,011 --> 02:00:18,805
Nearly 3,000 so far.

1913
02:00:19,806 --> 02:00:22,976
Who makes them?
Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?

1914
02:00:23,226 --> 02:00:26,938
Bell was nearly bankrupt when First
National Bank of Boston asked the CIA...

1915
02:00:27,063 --> 02:00:31,109
...to use the helicopter in Indochina.
How about the F-111 fighter?

1916
02:00:31,651 --> 02:00:34,821
General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.
Who owns that?

1917
02:00:34,904 --> 02:00:39,617
Find out the defense budget since
the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.

1918
02:00:39,951 --> 02:00:42,954
Nearly $200 billion will be spent
before it's over.

1919
02:00:43,329 --> 02:00:45,290
In 1949, it was $10 billion.

1920
02:00:45,581 --> 02:00:47,292
No war... no money.

1921
02:00:48,418 --> 02:00:52,005
The organizing principle
of any society, Mr. Garrison...

1922
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:53,590
...is for war.

1923
02:00:53,965 --> 02:00:57,927
The authority of the state over its people
resides in its war powers.

1924
02:00:58,428 --> 02:01:01,431
Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War
in his second term.

1925
02:01:01,514 --> 02:01:04,934
He wanted to call off the moon race
and cooperate with the Soviets.

1926
02:01:05,059 --> 02:01:07,604
He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.

1927
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:10,273
He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.

1928
02:01:10,607 --> 02:01:12,984
He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.

1929
02:01:14,485 --> 02:01:18,239
But all that ended
on the 22nd of November, 1963.

1930
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:23,620
Since 1961, they knew Kennedy
was not going to war in Southeast Asia.

1931
02:01:23,995 --> 02:01:26,497
Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.

1932
02:01:26,623 --> 02:01:31,085
Something's underway, but it has no face.
Yet, everybody in the loop knows.

1933
02:01:31,294 --> 02:01:33,087
Forget about combat troops.

1934
02:01:33,212 --> 02:01:36,841
He told McNamara he would pull out
the goddamn advisors!

1935
02:01:38,259 --> 02:01:42,305
He fucked us in Laos and now
he will fuck us in Vietnam!

1936
02:01:42,805 --> 02:01:45,850
He can't afford to implement it
before the election.

1937
02:01:46,059 --> 02:01:48,353
I hear the NSC meeting
was a real barn burner.

1938
02:01:48,478 --> 02:01:53,107
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?

1939
02:01:53,483 --> 02:01:54,317
What?

1940
02:01:54,442 --> 02:01:56,569
Kennedy rubbed Lem's nose in shit.

1941
02:01:56,819 --> 02:01:59,614
Said if we didn't go into Cuba,
which was so close...

1942
02:01:59,739 --> 02:02:02,450
...why go into Vietnam
which is so far away?

1943
02:02:02,784 --> 02:02:04,285
There he goes again.

1944
02:02:04,369 --> 02:02:06,537
Got his hand on the chicken switch.

1945
02:02:06,788 --> 02:02:10,166
Lem said that the Chiefs still think
we should go into Cuba.

1946
02:02:10,291 --> 02:02:11,417
Money's at stake.

1947
02:02:11,542 --> 02:02:13,586
Big money. $100 billion.

1948
02:02:14,963 --> 02:02:17,799
Kennedy bred voting districts
for defense dollars.

1949
02:02:17,882 --> 02:02:22,220
He gave TFX fighter contracts only
to those counties that will matter in '64.

1950
02:02:22,553 --> 02:02:25,306
The people in the loop fight back.
Their way.

1951
02:02:25,807 --> 02:02:28,268
We have to control the intelligence
from Saigon.

1952
02:02:28,351 --> 02:02:32,021
We just don't let McNamara
stick his nose in this thing!

1953
02:02:32,522 --> 02:02:36,442
Every time he goes over to Saigon
for a fact-finding mission...

1954
02:02:36,651 --> 02:02:39,654
...he comes back
and scares the shit out of Kennedy!

1955
02:02:39,904 --> 02:02:41,489
Now I want Max Taylor
on him night and day...

1956
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:44,158
...like a fly on shit.

1957
02:02:44,867 --> 02:02:49,122
You control McNamara,
you control Kennedy.

1958
02:02:49,205 --> 02:02:50,832
I think it started like that.

1959
02:02:50,915 --> 02:02:52,333
In the wind.

1960
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:55,962
Defense contractors, oil bankers.
Just conversation.

1961
02:02:56,588 --> 02:03:00,216
A call is made. Maybe to someone
like my superior officer General Y.

1962
02:03:01,801 --> 02:03:04,220
We're going. We need your help.

1963
02:03:04,596 --> 02:03:05,680
When?

1964
02:03:06,222 --> 02:03:08,850
In the fall. Probably in the South.

1965
02:03:09,225 --> 02:03:12,103
- We want you to come up with a plan.
- I can do that.

1966
02:03:12,186 --> 02:03:13,813
Everything is cellularized.

1967
02:03:13,896 --> 02:03:17,483
No one said, "He must die. " No vote.
Nothing's on paper.

1968
02:03:18,026 --> 02:03:19,736
There's no one to blame.

1969
02:03:20,111 --> 02:03:22,363
It's as old as the crucifixion.

1970
02:03:22,697 --> 02:03:24,616
Or the military firing squad.

1971
02:03:24,907 --> 02:03:27,869
Five bullets, one blank. No one's guilty.

1972
02:03:28,453 --> 02:03:30,580
Everybody in the power structure...

1973
02:03:30,663 --> 02:03:32,540
...has a plausible deniability.

1974
02:03:32,624 --> 02:03:36,252
No compromising connections
except at the most secret point.

1975
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:39,505
But it must succeed.

1976
02:03:39,589 --> 02:03:42,300
No matter how many die
or how much it costs...

1977
02:03:42,383 --> 02:03:45,178
...the perpetrators must be
on the winning side...

1978
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:49,098
...and never subject to prosecution
for anything by anyone.

1979
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:51,517
That is a coup d'état.

1980
02:03:55,647 --> 02:03:58,524
Kennedy announces
the Texas trip in September.

1981
02:03:58,608 --> 02:04:01,819
At that moment,
second Oswalds pop up all over Dallas...

1982
02:04:02,278 --> 02:04:05,156
...where they have the mayor
and the cops in their pocket.

1983
02:04:05,239 --> 02:04:07,408
General Y flies in the assassins.

1984
02:04:07,533 --> 02:04:11,204
Maybe from the special camp
we keep near Athens, Greece.

1985
02:04:11,371 --> 02:04:12,288
Pros.

1986
02:04:12,538 --> 02:04:16,042
Maybe be locals, Cubans, Mafia hire.
Separate teams.

1987
02:04:16,417 --> 02:04:18,211
Does it matter who shot...

1988
02:04:18,836 --> 02:04:20,505
...from what rooftop?

1989
02:04:21,839 --> 02:04:23,508
Part of the scenery.

1990
02:04:24,092 --> 02:04:26,594
I keep thinking about that Tuesday...

1991
02:04:26,844 --> 02:04:28,346
...the 26th of November.

1992
02:04:28,429 --> 02:04:30,265
The day after they buried Kennedy.

1993
02:04:30,348 --> 02:04:34,185
Gentlemen, I am not going
to let Vietnam go like China did.

1994
02:04:34,978 --> 02:04:36,396
I'm committed...

1995
02:04:36,521 --> 02:04:41,025
...not to take our soldiers out of there
till they know we mean business in Asia.

1996
02:04:41,484 --> 02:04:44,821
Lyndon Johnson signs
National Security Memo 273...

1997
02:04:44,988 --> 02:04:47,615
...which reverses
Kennedy's withdrawal policy...

1998
02:04:47,699 --> 02:04:50,493
...and approves covert action
against North Vietnam...

1999
02:04:50,576 --> 02:04:52,704
...provoking the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

2000
02:04:52,787 --> 02:04:56,040
Just get me elected,
I'll give you the damn war.

2001
02:04:57,834 --> 02:04:59,377
In that document...

2002
02:05:00,628 --> 02:05:02,297
...lay the Vietnam War.

2003
02:05:07,719 --> 02:05:11,514
I can't believe they killed him
because he wanted to change things.

2004
02:05:12,724 --> 02:05:16,144
- In our time, in our country!
- They've done it throughout history.

2005
02:05:16,227 --> 02:05:19,647
Kings are killed. Politics is power,
nothing more!

2006
02:05:20,648 --> 02:05:23,901
Don't take my word for it.
Do your own thinking.

2007
02:05:26,571 --> 02:05:28,156
The size of this is...

2008
02:05:28,990 --> 02:05:30,325
...beyond me.

2009
02:05:30,867 --> 02:05:32,160
Testify.

2010
02:05:32,243 --> 02:05:33,745
- Me?
- Testify.

2011
02:05:35,330 --> 02:05:36,915
No chance in hell.

2012
02:05:37,665 --> 02:05:41,628
No, I'd be arrested and gagged.
Maybe sent to an institution.

2013
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:43,588
Maybe worse. You too.

2014
02:05:44,339 --> 02:05:48,509
I can give you the background.
You find the foreground, the little things.

2015
02:05:48,593 --> 02:05:52,263
Dig, you're the only one to bring a trial
in Kennedy's murder.

2016
02:05:52,513 --> 02:05:54,849
That's important. It's historic.

2017
02:05:55,516 --> 02:05:57,018
I haven't yet.

2018
02:05:57,769 --> 02:06:00,021
I don't have much of a case.

2019
02:06:01,105 --> 02:06:03,191
You don't have a choice anymore.

2020
02:06:03,441 --> 02:06:07,111
You're a significant threat
to the national security structure.

2021
02:06:07,528 --> 02:06:10,531
They'd have killed you already,
but there's light on you.

2022
02:06:10,615 --> 02:06:12,784
So they'll destroy your credibility.

2023
02:06:12,867 --> 02:06:15,036
They already have in many circles.

2024
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:16,621
Be honest.

2025
02:06:16,955 --> 02:06:21,209
Your only chance is to come up
with a case. Something. Anything.

2026
02:06:21,751 --> 02:06:24,295
Make arrests. Stir the shitstorm.

2027
02:06:25,046 --> 02:06:26,714
Hope to start...

2028
02:06:27,048 --> 02:06:29,717
...a chain reaction
of people coming forward.

2029
02:06:29,801 --> 02:06:31,803
Then the government will crack.

2030
02:06:31,886 --> 02:06:35,139
Fundamentally, people are suckers
for the truth.

2031
02:06:35,306 --> 02:06:37,642
And the truth is on your side, bubba.

2032
02:06:44,899 --> 02:06:46,484
I just hope you get a break.

2033
02:07:31,904 --> 02:07:32,989
Mr. Shaw?

2034
02:07:33,781 --> 02:07:36,159
You are under arrest for conspiracy...

2035
02:07:36,451 --> 02:07:40,788
...and entering into agreement with others
for the purpose of murdering...

2036
02:07:40,955 --> 02:07:42,707
...President John F. Kennedy.

2037
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:45,335
We have a warrant to search the premises.

2038
02:07:45,793 --> 02:07:47,754
It's my duty to inform you...

2039
02:07:48,379 --> 02:07:50,965
...you have the right to remain silent.

2040
02:07:51,132 --> 02:07:52,300
Name?

2041
02:07:52,717 --> 02:07:54,385
Clay LaVerne Shaw.

2042
02:07:56,804 --> 02:07:57,889
Address?

2043
02:07:58,056 --> 02:08:00,600
1313 Dauphine Street, New Orleans.

2044
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:04,187
Ever use any aliases?

2045
02:08:04,479 --> 02:08:06,022
Clay Bertrand.

2046
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:16,574
Mr. Clark, are you aware of the charges
filed by District Attorney Garrison?

2047
02:08:16,658 --> 02:08:19,786
Yes, Mr. Shaw was included
in our investigation.

2048
02:08:20,286 --> 02:08:22,664
No connection was found at all.

2049
02:08:23,289 --> 02:08:26,834
If the FBI did investigate him,
why is his name not mentioned...

2050
02:08:26,918 --> 02:08:29,712
...in the entire 26 volumes
of the Warren Report...

2051
02:08:29,796 --> 02:08:32,131
...even if it is to clear his name?

2052
02:08:32,674 --> 02:08:36,427
I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.

2053
02:08:36,636 --> 02:08:40,306
Mr. Garrison has presented
absolutely nothing publicly...

2054
02:08:40,932 --> 02:08:43,351
...which would contradict our findings.

2055
02:08:44,102 --> 02:08:47,272
I know of no fact which would refute...

2056
02:08:47,939 --> 02:08:50,108
...the Commission's conclusion...

2057
02:08:50,275 --> 02:08:53,069
...that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

2058
02:08:55,571 --> 02:08:59,200
I congratulate Mr. Shaw.
Most defendants must wait for trial...

2059
02:08:59,284 --> 02:09:02,996
...before they produce sacred cows
like a Chief Justice...

2060
02:09:03,371 --> 02:09:04,831
...as a character witness...

2061
02:09:04,914 --> 02:09:08,251
...who is not under oath
and therefore free from perjury.

2062
02:09:08,626 --> 02:09:10,795
Even if it's partly true...

2063
02:09:11,129 --> 02:09:15,133
...you realize you're damaging
the credibility of the country?

2064
02:09:15,925 --> 02:09:19,804
Is a government worth preserving
when it lies to the people?

2065
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:22,890
It's become a dangerous country...

2066
02:09:22,974 --> 02:09:26,603
...when you cannot trust anyone.
When you cannot tell the truth.

2067
02:09:27,979 --> 02:09:31,190
I say let justice be done,
though the heavens fall!

2068
02:09:37,447 --> 02:09:40,533
The JFK Conspiracy:
The Case of Jim Garrison.

2069
02:09:41,326 --> 02:09:45,079
- Honey, this is about you.
- After an investigation in New Orleans...

2070
02:09:45,163 --> 02:09:46,873
...reporters have learned...

2071
02:09:46,956 --> 02:09:50,168
...that District Attorney Jim Garrison
and his staff...

2072
02:09:50,335 --> 02:09:54,047
...have intimidated,
bribed and even drugged witnesses...

2073
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:59,010
...to attempt to prove a conspiracy
involving businessman Clay Shaw...

2074
02:09:59,636 --> 02:10:01,888
...in the murder of John F. Kennedy.

2075
02:10:02,472 --> 02:10:06,309
John Chancler was a cellmate
of Willie O'Keefe's at Angola.

2076
02:10:07,018 --> 02:10:10,480
He said he'd be cut loose
if he copped to the DA's office.

2077
02:10:10,647 --> 02:10:12,565
I sent him up for burglary.

2078
02:10:13,858 --> 02:10:16,361
And there's his old buddy Miguel Torres.

2079
02:10:16,653 --> 02:10:18,196
We sent him up too.

2080
02:10:18,363 --> 02:10:22,492
They wanted me to say Shaw
was Bertrand. They'd get me a pardon.

2081
02:10:22,825 --> 02:10:25,828
Janet Williams comments
on Willie O'Keefe's...

2082
02:10:26,037 --> 02:10:28,539
...descriptions of having met Oswald.

2083
02:10:28,706 --> 02:10:30,333
Was he a homosexual?

2084
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:32,752
Not the Lee I knew. Absolutely not.

2085
02:10:33,336 --> 02:10:36,881
Mr. O'Keefe must have seen someone
he thought was Lee Oswald.

2086
02:10:37,048 --> 02:10:40,718
I didn't talk to nobody.
I was on drugs at the hospital.

2087
02:10:41,344 --> 02:10:45,098
I told the FBI that call was a figment
of my imagination.

2088
02:10:45,348 --> 02:10:47,517
I think he's quite ill, mentally.

2089
02:10:47,684 --> 02:10:51,396
With one half of his mind,
he is able to fabricate evidence...

2090
02:10:52,397 --> 02:10:56,734
...then he convinces the other half
that the fabrication is the truth.

2091
02:10:57,151 --> 02:11:01,447
Don't worry. There's only 20
or 30 million people watching this tonight.

2092
02:11:03,700 --> 02:11:06,661
My reputation's all right
with the people watching Laugh In.

2093
02:11:06,744 --> 02:11:09,664
Has he ignored the Mafia connections
to this conspiracy...

2094
02:11:09,747 --> 02:11:12,834
...because he's indebted to the mob?

2095
02:11:13,376 --> 02:11:16,838
The more one looks at Jim Garrison,
the more one finds...

2096
02:11:17,005 --> 02:11:21,968
...he has destroyed reputations, spread fear
and suspicion, and worst of all...

2097
02:11:22,302 --> 02:11:25,346
...exploited this nation's sorrow and doubt.

2098
02:11:25,597 --> 02:11:27,515
Jim Garrison has said:

2099
02:11:28,433 --> 02:11:31,603
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall. "

2100
02:11:32,061 --> 02:11:34,397
He seeks the truth. So do we.

2101
02:11:46,618 --> 02:11:50,371
Dr. Martin Luther King's beautiful dream
expressed so dramatically...

2102
02:11:50,455 --> 02:11:53,124
...during the 1963 march on Washington...

2103
02:11:53,207 --> 02:11:56,711
...was shattered tonight in Memphis,
Tennessee by an assassin's bullet.

2104
02:11:56,794 --> 02:12:00,006
Police think the single shot came
from across the street.

2105
02:12:00,089 --> 02:12:04,552
They found a Browning automatic rifle,
fitted with a marksman's scope.

2106
02:12:05,803 --> 02:12:07,263
I'll get it.

2107
02:12:09,933 --> 02:12:12,727
Hello, is this Jim Garrison's daughter?

2108
02:12:13,603 --> 02:12:15,521
Virginia or Elizabeth?

2109
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:19,317
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.

2110
02:12:19,484 --> 02:12:23,655
Your daddy's entered you
in a beauty contest. Like to be in one?

2111
02:12:24,656 --> 02:12:25,949
I don't know.

2112
02:12:26,032 --> 02:12:28,368
My God! What have they done?

2113
02:12:29,577 --> 02:12:31,120
It's lynching time.

2114
02:12:33,957 --> 02:12:35,458
That sounds fun.

2115
02:12:36,167 --> 02:12:38,336
You get out of school at 3:00?

2116
02:12:38,503 --> 02:12:40,088
Who are you talking to?

2117
02:12:40,171 --> 02:12:42,006
That's all I need to know.

2118
02:12:42,090 --> 02:12:45,051
Mommy, I'm going to be
in a beauty contest.

2119
02:12:45,301 --> 02:12:47,428
Who is this? Who is this?

2120
02:12:49,889 --> 02:12:52,600
Did you enter Virginia in a beauty contest?

2121
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:55,603
A man called and asked her height,
her weight-

2122
02:12:55,687 --> 02:12:58,773
Some crackpot.
Martin Luther King was killed.

2123
02:12:58,982 --> 02:13:00,608
Her life's been threatened!

2124
02:13:00,692 --> 02:13:03,820
A crank making calls.
Happens a dozen times a day at the office.

2125
02:13:03,903 --> 02:13:06,489
Our home! A kidnapper, a murderer!

2126
02:13:06,948 --> 02:13:08,700
Only cowards make crank calls.

2127
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,535
Nothing will happen.

2128
02:13:10,702 --> 02:13:15,206
You don't know what goes on here
anymore! You're busy making speeches!

2129
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:18,334
Getting every crazed Klansman after us!

2130
02:13:18,543 --> 02:13:22,964
I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!
I can't stand it anymore!

2131
02:13:23,047 --> 02:13:25,925
- The government wants us scared.
- You and your government!

2132
02:13:26,009 --> 02:13:29,721
They want everybody too scared
to speak out. They count on it.

2133
02:13:29,887 --> 02:13:32,890
- There's nothing to fear!
- Don't you have feelings?

2134
02:13:34,726 --> 02:13:36,477
Your own daughter!

2135
02:13:36,894 --> 02:13:39,022
What kind of a man are you?

2136
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:46,404
I'll take them to my mother's.
You spend a week.

2137
02:13:46,696 --> 02:13:49,490
I'll change the locks, the phones.
I'll get a bodyguard.

2138
02:13:49,574 --> 02:13:51,576
Get a hold of yourself!

2139
02:13:51,909 --> 02:13:55,538
Before this Kennedy thing,
your children mattered most.

2140
02:13:55,914 --> 02:13:58,875
The other night you didn't
even notice Jasper.

2141
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,169
He came to me bawling his eyes out.

2142
02:14:01,252 --> 02:14:04,172
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

2143
02:14:04,547 --> 02:14:06,299
Is it such a chore?

2144
02:14:06,382 --> 02:14:10,345
Goddamn it! If I said I'll spend
more time with him, I will!

2145
02:14:10,887 --> 02:14:13,139
I cannot fight you and the whole world too!

2146
02:14:13,222 --> 02:14:16,017
I'm not fighting you!
I'm trying to reach you.

2147
02:14:16,434 --> 02:14:19,270
- You've changed.
- Of course I've changed!

2148
02:14:20,021 --> 02:14:21,648
My eyes have opened.

2149
02:14:22,106 --> 02:14:24,943
And what once looked normal
seems insane.

2150
02:14:25,026 --> 02:14:28,696
And now King. Don't you think
this has something to do with that?

2151
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:29,864
Can't you see?

2152
02:14:29,989 --> 02:14:33,910
I don't want to see, goddamn it!
I'm tired. I've had enough!

2153
02:14:34,452 --> 02:14:38,456
You're ruining this man Shaw's life
because he's a homosexual.

2154
02:14:38,581 --> 02:14:40,124
That's not why!

2155
02:14:40,541 --> 02:14:43,711
Did you ever once stop
to consider his feelings?

2156
02:14:46,130 --> 02:14:47,757
You don't believe me?

2157
02:14:48,091 --> 02:14:50,802
- I don't know!
- You never believed me?

2158
02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:55,723
I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life.

2159
02:14:55,848 --> 02:14:57,684
I want my life back!

2160
02:14:58,768 --> 02:15:00,603
So do I, goddamn it!

2161
02:15:01,187 --> 02:15:03,231
I had a life too, you know!

2162
02:15:03,606 --> 02:15:07,360
You can't bury your head in the sand
like an ostrich, Liz!

2163
02:15:07,652 --> 02:15:12,115
It's not about our well-being, our two cars,
our TVs and your kitchen!

2164
02:15:14,117 --> 02:15:17,370
It's about our kids growing up
in a shithole of lies. I'm angry!

2165
02:15:17,453 --> 02:15:19,581
My life is fucked because of it.

2166
02:15:19,872 --> 02:15:23,042
If you could see it that way,
you'd see your life is fucked too.

2167
02:15:23,126 --> 02:15:24,877
You never talked to me this way.

2168
02:15:24,961 --> 02:15:27,088
If you don't want to support me, fine.

2169
02:15:27,171 --> 02:15:30,091
But don't make threats
about taking the children.

2170
02:15:30,174 --> 02:15:31,634
I'm leaving you!

2171
02:15:31,843 --> 02:15:34,387
- I'm taking the children!
- Go on! Get out!

2172
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:35,972
- I am!
- Go hide!

2173
02:15:36,139 --> 02:15:38,349
Join the rest! They'll say I'm crazy.

2174
02:15:38,474 --> 02:15:41,019
Plenty of people will tell you I'm crazy.

2175
02:15:42,729 --> 02:15:46,065
You won't have any problems
filling out divorce papers.

2176
02:15:47,191 --> 02:15:49,652
But somebody's got to try, goddamn it!

2177
02:15:49,986 --> 02:15:51,321
Somebody!

2178
02:15:55,533 --> 02:15:57,577
Are we going away, Daddy?

2179
02:16:05,001 --> 02:16:06,711
I don't know, Jasper.

2180
02:16:07,545 --> 02:16:08,796
Because of Kennedy?

2181
02:16:09,672 --> 02:16:12,216
Will the same people kill us, Papa?

2182
02:16:15,011 --> 02:16:16,804
Nobody will kill us.

2183
02:16:17,513 --> 02:16:18,598
I'm scared.

2184
02:16:19,891 --> 02:16:22,810
I don't like it when you and Mommy fight.

2185
02:16:25,688 --> 02:16:27,649
I don't like it either, honey.

2186
02:16:28,733 --> 02:16:30,777
Why do we have to leave?

2187
02:16:31,569 --> 02:16:33,696
Don't you love us anymore?

2188
02:16:36,532 --> 02:16:38,409
Daddy loves you both.

2189
02:16:40,078 --> 02:16:43,414
There's nothing wrong
with feeling a little scared, Jasper.

2190
02:16:43,706 --> 02:16:46,876
Telling the truth can be
a scary thing sometimes.

2191
02:16:47,877 --> 02:16:50,880
It scared President Kennedy,
and he was a brave man.

2192
02:16:51,881 --> 02:16:54,550
But if you let yourself be too scared...

2193
02:16:54,759 --> 02:16:57,845
...then you let the bad guys
take over the country.

2194
02:16:59,472 --> 02:17:01,266
Then everybody gets scared.

2195
02:17:02,392 --> 02:17:04,102
Stay with Mom, Papa.

2196
02:17:04,227 --> 02:17:05,436
Please.

2197
02:17:13,152 --> 02:17:14,404
Here's another.

2198
02:17:14,612 --> 02:17:17,949
The US Attorney in Washington declines
to serve our subpoena...

2199
02:17:18,074 --> 02:17:22,453
...on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell,
CIA Director Richard Helms, any FBI agent.

2200
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:25,248
What'd you expect from a pig but a grunt?

2201
02:17:25,456 --> 02:17:29,752
Now it'll be near impossible
to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.

2202
02:17:29,919 --> 02:17:31,296
What's going on?

2203
02:17:31,462 --> 02:17:34,716
We've never been refused
an extradition request.

2204
02:17:34,966 --> 02:17:37,010
Let's get Julia Ann Mercer in here.

2205
02:17:37,135 --> 02:17:38,928
No, she could get hurt.

2206
02:17:39,387 --> 02:17:41,681
Look what's happening to other people.

2207
02:17:41,806 --> 02:17:43,850
She's the best witness we have.

2208
02:17:43,975 --> 02:17:47,061
I just don't want to do it. Now, what else?

2209
02:17:48,187 --> 02:17:51,608
You got your hate mail here.
And your fan mail here.

2210
02:17:52,859 --> 02:17:57,488
The bad news is that the IRS requested
an audit of your income from this office.

2211
02:17:58,448 --> 02:18:02,243
I expected that two months ago.
They're wasting their time.

2212
02:18:05,121 --> 02:18:09,250
The bad news is the National Guard
just asked me to resign after 18 years.

2213
02:18:10,501 --> 02:18:14,130
Maybe that's the good news.
Never was as good as combat.

2214
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:16,341
But this is.

2215
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:19,594
Any more on Oswald or Shaw?

2216
02:18:21,554 --> 02:18:24,641
They were seen together in Clinton
in early September.

2217
02:18:24,933 --> 02:18:28,686
The Civil Rights Movement
was running a voter's registration drive.

2218
02:18:29,145 --> 02:18:32,398
Rumor is, Shaw was working
on some arms deal...

2219
02:18:32,565 --> 02:18:35,109
...to discredit the Civil Rights Movement.

2220
02:18:35,443 --> 02:18:38,529
Nobody really knows
what they were doing there, but...

2221
02:18:38,655 --> 02:18:40,782
...hell, they stood out like cotton balls.

2222
02:18:40,907 --> 02:18:43,576
I got whites and coloreds
that saw them there.

2223
02:18:43,701 --> 02:18:47,121
Last time I checked,
it was not illegal to register to vote.

2224
02:18:48,081 --> 02:18:49,749
We still got the...

2225
02:18:50,124 --> 02:18:54,587
...the junkie, Vernon Bundy,
who saw him talking at the sea wall.

2226
02:18:55,255 --> 02:18:57,966
This is tough.
No one wants to talk about Shaw.

2227
02:18:58,341 --> 02:18:59,884
You keep saying that.

2228
02:19:00,176 --> 02:19:02,679
- I keep saying what?
- You're not digging deep enough.

2229
02:19:02,804 --> 02:19:05,682
You want to do my job!
You do my job, I'll do your job.

2230
02:19:05,807 --> 02:19:08,226
I think Clinton is a breakthrough now.

2231
02:19:09,894 --> 02:19:12,272
Shaw denies ever knowing Oswald, right?

2232
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:15,149
That proves he's a liar.

2233
02:19:17,151 --> 02:19:18,903
- Keep on it, Bill.
- This is the interesting part.

2234
02:19:19,654 --> 02:19:21,864
Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks...

2235
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:23,741
...before the assassination.

2236
02:19:23,825 --> 02:19:25,702
May I see Special Agent Hosty?

2237
02:19:25,827 --> 02:19:27,912
He's not in. Can someone else help you?

2238
02:19:27,996 --> 02:19:31,874
Special Agent Hosty made three visits
to Janet Williams' house...

2239
02:19:32,125 --> 02:19:34,836
...to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.

2240
02:19:34,919 --> 02:19:37,839
Hosty told a newspaperman
it was a warning...

2241
02:19:38,172 --> 02:19:41,634
...to stop questioning Marina
when Oswald was not present.

2242
02:19:41,759 --> 02:19:46,389
She was not a citizen, so possibly
he was threatening to deport her to Russia.

2243
02:19:47,223 --> 02:19:49,475
But what the note really said,
no one knows.

2244
02:19:49,934 --> 02:19:52,562
Hosty tore it up
and flushed it down the toilet.

2245
02:19:52,645 --> 02:19:54,355
This is just speculation.

2246
02:19:54,647 --> 02:19:58,443
But what if the note described
the assassination attempt on JFK?

2247
02:20:04,782 --> 02:20:06,367
Come on, think!

2248
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:09,120
That's the only reason to destroy it.

2249
02:20:09,454 --> 02:20:13,374
If it was a threat like Hosty said,
they would have kept it.

2250
02:20:13,833 --> 02:20:17,629
It makes their case against the angry,
lone nut that much stronger.

2251
02:20:18,171 --> 02:20:20,340
Remember the meeting
with Agent Quigley...

2252
02:20:20,423 --> 02:20:21,925
...the day he was arrested?

2253
02:20:22,008 --> 02:20:24,844
Quigley destroyed the notes
from the interview.

2254
02:20:25,136 --> 02:20:29,098
We can raise the possibility
that Oswald was not only an informant...

2255
02:20:29,766 --> 02:20:34,646
...but he may have been the original source
for the telex dated November 17...

2256
02:20:35,146 --> 02:20:39,233
...warning of Kennedy's assassination
in Dallas on November 22.

2257
02:20:41,653 --> 02:20:45,740
William Walter, the FBI night clerk,
gave me a copy.

2258
02:20:46,157 --> 02:20:48,910
It went all over the country.
Nothing was done.

2259
02:20:48,993 --> 02:20:52,789
The motorcade went ahead on schedule.
The Warren Report didn't mention it.

2260
02:20:52,872 --> 02:20:56,834
"A militant group may attempt
to assassinate President Kennedy...

2261
02:20:56,918 --> 02:20:58,962
"... on his proposed trip
to Dallas, Texas. "

2262
02:20:59,379 --> 02:21:01,130
Shortly after the assassination...

2263
02:21:01,214 --> 02:21:05,301
...Walter says the telex was removed
from all the files...

2264
02:21:05,551 --> 02:21:08,221
...as an obvious embarrassment
to the Bureau.

2265
02:21:09,514 --> 02:21:11,933
I believe Oswald sent information
through Hosty.

2266
02:21:12,475 --> 02:21:16,104
I have a hunch Oswald
had infiltrated this group:

2267
02:21:16,354 --> 02:21:18,648
Cubans or right-wing extremists.

2268
02:21:19,315 --> 02:21:22,777
He was told to be
at the Book Depository that day...

2269
02:21:23,152 --> 02:21:26,072
...to either prevent the assassination
or take part in it.

2270
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:30,159
Either they told him
they'd close down the plotters...

2271
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:32,620
...or simulate an attack...

2272
02:21:32,704 --> 02:21:35,081
...on Kennedy to whip up public opinion...

2273
02:21:35,164 --> 02:21:38,376
...so Kennedy would have to reverse
his policies on communism.

2274
02:21:39,168 --> 02:21:41,337
What they told him doesn't matter.

2275
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:43,381
He was under orders.

2276
02:21:43,464 --> 02:21:45,300
He was a foot soldier.

2277
02:21:47,885 --> 02:21:50,722
You can't miss. He is a dead duck.

2278
02:21:51,889 --> 02:21:53,182
I don't buy it.

2279
02:21:53,558 --> 02:21:55,560
Why would the FBI cover it up?

2280
02:21:55,852 --> 02:21:59,606
A telex disappears from every FBI office
in this country?

2281
02:22:00,189 --> 02:22:01,733
There's a word, Bill.

2282
02:22:01,899 --> 02:22:03,901
- Orders.
- Or a cover-up.

2283
02:22:04,944 --> 02:22:07,989
Don't you have enough proof
of the FBl's complicity yet?

2284
02:22:08,072 --> 02:22:10,408
I respect this country's institutions!

2285
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:16,039
How the hell can you keep
a conspiracy going...

2286
02:22:16,247 --> 02:22:21,002
...between the mob, CIA, FBl, Army
intelligence and who knows what else...

2287
02:22:21,210 --> 02:22:25,089
...when you can't keep a secret
in this room between 12 people?

2288
02:22:25,256 --> 02:22:27,300
I mean, we got leaks everywhere.

2289
02:22:27,383 --> 02:22:29,677
We are going to trial, y'all!

2290
02:22:30,261 --> 02:22:32,430
What the hell do we really got?

2291
02:22:32,597 --> 02:22:35,558
Oswald, Ruby, Banister,
and Ferrie are dead.

2292
02:22:36,267 --> 02:22:39,020
Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.

2293
02:22:39,228 --> 02:22:40,855
But as a covert operator...

2294
02:22:40,939 --> 02:22:44,484
...he is wide open for blackmail
because of his homosexuality.

2295
02:22:44,567 --> 02:22:48,446
Shaw's our toehold.
I don't know or care exactly how he fits.

2296
02:22:48,947 --> 02:22:52,116
But he's lying through his teeth.
I won't let go of him.

2297
02:22:52,283 --> 02:22:55,036
That's why you're going to trial
against Clay Shaw?

2298
02:22:55,119 --> 02:22:56,663
You will lose!

2299
02:22:56,955 --> 02:22:59,749
We should investigate
our Mafia leads here.

2300
02:22:59,916 --> 02:23:03,127
I can buy that easier
than I can the government.

2301
02:23:04,295 --> 02:23:07,840
Ruby is all mob, knows Oswald,
sets him up.

2302
02:23:08,591 --> 02:23:12,595
Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,
they hire some guns and do Kennedy.

2303
02:23:12,929 --> 02:23:16,391
The government doesn't want
to open up a whole can of worms...

2304
02:23:16,474 --> 02:23:19,477
...because it used the mob
to try to get Castro.

2305
02:23:20,144 --> 02:23:23,606
Castro being assassinated
by the mob by us...

2306
02:23:23,815 --> 02:23:25,817
...sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.

2307
02:23:25,900 --> 02:23:28,361
So they close the book on JFK.

2308
02:23:29,946 --> 02:23:31,447
Makes perfect sense to me.

2309
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:34,534
I don't doubt their involvement
at a low level.

2310
02:23:35,326 --> 02:23:37,704
Could the mob change the parade route?

2311
02:23:37,996 --> 02:23:40,790
Or eliminate the protection
for the President?

2312
02:23:41,082 --> 02:23:44,252
Could the mob send Oswald to Russia
and get him back?

2313
02:23:44,669 --> 02:23:49,257
Get the FBl, the CIA and the Dallas Police
to mess up the investigation?

2314
02:23:49,465 --> 02:23:52,802
Get the Warren Commission appointed
to cover it up?

2315
02:23:53,303 --> 02:23:57,557
Wreck the autopsy? Influence
the national media to go to sleep?

2316
02:23:57,890 --> 02:24:01,394
Since when has the mob used anything
but. 38's for hits up close?

2317
02:24:03,187 --> 02:24:07,442
The mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this magnitude.

2318
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:09,694
Assassins need payrolls...

2319
02:24:10,194 --> 02:24:12,280
...schedules, times, orders.

2320
02:24:13,197 --> 02:24:15,700
This was a military-style ambush.

2321
02:24:16,034 --> 02:24:19,537
A coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson
waiting in the wings.

2322
02:24:19,829 --> 02:24:23,625
You're saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved? The President?

2323
02:24:24,167 --> 02:24:27,545
Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,
Brown and Root...

2324
02:24:27,712 --> 02:24:30,173
...to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.

2325
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:33,509
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

2326
02:24:33,676 --> 02:24:37,221
If I'm so far from the truth,
why is the FBI bugging our offices?

2327
02:24:37,305 --> 02:24:40,099
Why are witnesses being bought off
and murdered?

2328
02:24:40,391 --> 02:24:44,020
Why are federal agencies blocking
our extraditions and subpoenas?

2329
02:24:44,187 --> 02:24:45,688
I don't know.

2330
02:24:46,022 --> 02:24:49,025
Maybe there's some rogue element
in the government.

2331
02:24:49,192 --> 02:24:51,361
With a full-blown cover-up?

2332
02:24:52,737 --> 02:24:54,739
You ever read Shakespeare?

2333
02:24:57,367 --> 02:24:58,534
I do.

2334
02:24:59,202 --> 02:25:00,745
Julius Caesar?

2335
02:25:01,537 --> 02:25:04,832
"Brutus and Cassius,
they too are honorable men. "

2336
02:25:05,583 --> 02:25:07,252
Who killed Caesar?

2337
02:25:08,044 --> 02:25:10,046
Ten or twelve Senators.

2338
02:25:10,255 --> 02:25:12,382
All it takes is one Judas.

2339
02:25:13,091 --> 02:25:16,094
A few people on the inside. Pentagon, CIA.

2340
02:25:16,427 --> 02:25:18,179
This is Louisiana.

2341
02:25:18,763 --> 02:25:23,184
How do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your mama told you so.

2342
02:25:24,102 --> 02:25:26,437
You are taking a crap in the wind.

2343
02:25:26,813 --> 02:25:29,816
And I am not going along on this one.

2344
02:25:39,909 --> 02:25:42,745
I've had my doubts all along about Bill.

2345
02:25:43,288 --> 02:25:45,206
He's been fighting us.

2346
02:25:46,541 --> 02:25:47,917
We need him back.

2347
02:25:48,293 --> 02:25:50,587
He wasted a month trying to prove...

2348
02:25:50,753 --> 02:25:54,424
...that mob boys like Jack Ruby
are hooked up with Hunt Oil.

2349
02:25:54,591 --> 02:25:56,884
- I don't trust him.
- I will not hear this.

2350
02:25:56,968 --> 02:25:59,846
I value Bill as much as any person here.

2351
02:26:01,139 --> 02:26:05,143
It's time we made room
for someone else's ideas, including me.

2352
02:26:06,436 --> 02:26:09,439
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is,
and I'm...

2353
02:26:09,981 --> 02:26:11,899
...just plain dumb about it.

2354
02:26:11,983 --> 02:26:14,736
I've seen him copying files here
late at night.

2355
02:26:14,819 --> 02:26:17,488
- I don't trust him.
- Did you two hear me?

2356
02:26:17,655 --> 02:26:19,991
I won't tolerate staff infighting.

2357
02:26:20,158 --> 02:26:23,494
I'm afraid I cannot work
with Bill Broussard anymore.

2358
02:26:24,787 --> 02:26:26,456
Is this an ultimatum?

2359
02:26:28,124 --> 02:26:29,834
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2360
02:26:29,918 --> 02:26:32,128
If that's what you want to call it.

2361
02:26:34,339 --> 02:26:36,507
I never thought it'd come to this.

2362
02:26:40,136 --> 02:26:41,387
I guess I am.

2363
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:47,268
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

2364
02:26:51,481 --> 02:26:53,024
You sure got it.

2365
02:26:58,363 --> 02:27:00,990
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

2366
02:27:03,326 --> 02:27:05,245
You're making a big mistake.

2367
02:27:12,627 --> 02:27:15,338
Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

2368
02:27:16,589 --> 02:27:18,341
No, I don't think I am.

2369
02:27:19,926 --> 02:27:21,135
Anyone else?

2370
02:27:26,224 --> 02:27:29,018
Now, Jerry, here's Jim Garrison...

2371
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:32,605
...the District Attorney
of New Orleans, Louisiana.

2372
02:27:47,287 --> 02:27:49,539
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

2373
02:27:50,373 --> 02:27:53,751
You're investigating the murder
of President Kennedy.

2374
02:27:54,294 --> 02:27:57,755
We have heard some strange things
coming out of your office.

2375
02:27:58,506 --> 02:28:02,218
First, we heard that Cuban exiles
killed the President.

2376
02:28:02,302 --> 02:28:03,761
Then the mob...

2377
02:28:04,470 --> 02:28:09,566
Your latest theory seems to be
that the CIA and the FBl...

2378
02:28:09,650 --> 02:28:10,767
...and the Pentagon...

2379
02:28:10,768 --> 02:28:15,940
...and the White House all combined
in an elaborate conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

2380
02:28:17,633 --> 02:28:19,844
Is there anyone
besides Lee Harvey Oswald...

2381
02:28:19,969 --> 02:28:23,139
...who you think didn't conspire
to kill the President?

2382
02:28:25,766 --> 02:28:27,727
Let's just say this, Jerry...

2383
02:28:28,436 --> 02:28:29,979
...I've stopped beating my wife.

2384
02:28:32,231 --> 02:28:35,484
Maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson.
He has some answers.

2385
02:28:39,739 --> 02:28:42,908
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media...

2386
02:28:43,034 --> 02:28:45,369
...Time, Newsweek, our own NBC...

2387
02:28:45,911 --> 02:28:49,832
...that you've gone beyond legal means
as a prosecutor...

2388
02:28:50,791 --> 02:28:53,794
...that you've intimidated,
even drugged witnesses...

2389
02:28:53,878 --> 02:28:56,964
...bribed them, and urged them
to commit perjury.

2390
02:28:57,423 --> 02:28:58,883
Do you have a response?

2391
02:28:58,966 --> 02:29:02,261
Your faith in the veracity
of the major media is touching.

2392
02:29:02,511 --> 02:29:05,473
It indicates that the age of innocence
is not yet over.

2393
02:29:05,598 --> 02:29:07,058
But ask yourself...

2394
02:29:07,183 --> 02:29:09,852
...if we had learned
on November 22, 1963...

2395
02:29:09,977 --> 02:29:13,356
...that the Russian Premier had been shot
from a Moscow building...

2396
02:29:13,481 --> 02:29:15,399
...by a lonely capitalist sympathizer...

2397
02:29:15,524 --> 02:29:19,779
...who, himself, was then liquidated
by a patriotic Muscovite within 48 hours...

2398
02:29:19,904 --> 02:29:21,656
...while surrounded by armed police.

2399
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:24,200
I think it would be apparent to anyone...

2400
02:29:24,325 --> 02:29:28,579
...that a coup d'etat and a transfer
of power had just taken place.

2401
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:32,917
And we would not ask questions
or attack Jim Garrison.

2402
02:29:33,167 --> 02:29:35,461
We would, in a free-thinking society...

2403
02:29:35,586 --> 02:29:39,715
...be asking why he was killed,
and what forces opposed him.

2404
02:29:40,424 --> 02:29:43,719
There are some people who might say
that you are paranoid.

2405
02:29:43,928 --> 02:29:47,181
I should show you some pictures
so you can understand...

2406
02:29:47,723 --> 02:29:49,517
...what I'm talking about.

2407
02:29:50,685 --> 02:29:52,269
These are arrests.

2408
02:29:52,603 --> 02:29:56,190
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination.

2409
02:29:56,273 --> 02:29:58,567
They were never shown to the public.

2410
02:29:58,651 --> 02:30:00,945
I'm sorry,
these pictures can't be shown on TV.

2411
02:30:01,028 --> 02:30:03,572
- Sure they can.
- No, I'm sorry. They can't.

2412
02:30:03,990 --> 02:30:06,742
- The camera can pick these up.
- Jim, I'm sorry.

2413
02:30:06,993 --> 02:30:09,704
They can't. We have libel laws.

2414
02:30:09,954 --> 02:30:13,916
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the assassination.

2415
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,751
They were never seen again.

2416
02:30:15,835 --> 02:30:18,921
No record of arrest,
no mug shots, no fingerprints.

2417
02:30:19,213 --> 02:30:20,464
Hold that thought.

2418
02:30:20,548 --> 02:30:23,342
We'll be back,
right after these commercials.

2419
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,731
Bill, what the hell are you doing here?

2420
02:30:36,814 --> 02:30:40,985
I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.

2421
02:30:41,944 --> 02:30:44,613
You came all this way
to tell me the obvious?

2422
02:30:44,989 --> 02:30:46,198
No. Look...

2423
02:30:46,615 --> 02:30:50,619
...I just heard of an attempt to kill you
between here and New Orleans.

2424
02:30:51,329 --> 02:30:54,665
A mob guy was brought down by Shaw
from Canada.

2425
02:30:54,957 --> 02:30:58,085
This is serious.
You'll need a bodyguard tonight.

2426
02:30:58,753 --> 02:31:02,673
When you were in the Army,
did you ever find out what an order meant?

2427
02:31:02,882 --> 02:31:06,052
Do you remember my orders
about passing on rumors...

2428
02:31:06,135 --> 02:31:08,346
...about someone going to be killed?

2429
02:31:08,429 --> 02:31:11,182
- Yes, I do, but this is-
- No, there is no "but. "

2430
02:31:11,265 --> 02:31:13,934
There is no "but" in a military situation!

2431
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:17,688
I don't appreciate you dumping
this paranoid garbage on me...

2432
02:31:17,772 --> 02:31:20,191
...nor your inability
to follow a simple order...

2433
02:31:20,274 --> 02:31:24,654
...especially when it means I have to pay
for your flight back to New Orleans.

2434
02:31:25,446 --> 02:31:27,156
Let's get you a ticket.

2435
02:31:28,616 --> 02:31:31,327
Boss, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for you.

2436
02:31:32,161 --> 02:31:33,621
Get a receipt.

2437
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,670
Come on, come on. He's out here.

2438
02:32:22,753 --> 02:32:25,965
Jim, where are you going?
It's me, Samuel.

2439
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:38,728
- Hey, how long were you in that restroom?
- None of your goddamn business.

2440
02:33:27,943 --> 02:33:30,488
Jim, bad news, Bill's turned.

2441
02:33:30,613 --> 02:33:33,324
I think he's given everything we've got
to the feds.

2442
02:33:33,407 --> 02:33:36,702
We studied the memos
and there was nothing there. Nothing.

2443
02:33:36,786 --> 02:33:40,456
We went to confront him and the landlady
said the son of a bitch just left.

2444
02:33:40,539 --> 02:33:41,916
Left everything.

2445
02:33:42,458 --> 02:33:44,210
It's unbelievable. I'm sorry.

2446
02:33:44,293 --> 02:33:47,213
Mattie, could you get Mr. Garrison
a drink, please?

2447
02:33:47,463 --> 02:33:49,256
Something sure scared him.

2448
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:52,301
Bill doesn't scare that easy.
Somebody got to his thinking.

2449
02:33:52,385 --> 02:33:55,513
- He was never that good a thinker.
- He sure fooled us.

2450
02:33:56,597 --> 02:34:00,017
No, no, leave it. Don't turn it down.
I want to see this.

2451
02:34:01,143 --> 02:34:03,562
You know what's happening, he's winning.

2452
02:34:05,856 --> 02:34:07,817
He'll never make it.

2453
02:34:08,567 --> 02:34:12,238
If he wins, they'll kill him.
He'll stop the war.

2454
02:34:13,990 --> 02:34:16,909
They'll kill him
before they let him be President.

2455
02:34:22,248 --> 02:34:24,750
With Broussard, they have everything...

2456
02:34:24,834 --> 02:34:27,503
...all our witnesses,
our strategies for the trial.

2457
02:34:27,586 --> 02:34:29,338
We got to double check his work.

2458
02:34:29,422 --> 02:34:32,299
There could be false leads.
We can't go to trial!

2459
02:34:32,466 --> 02:34:33,843
We don't have a prayer!

2460
02:34:33,926 --> 02:34:37,054
- I don't think so, Al.
- I have to agree with Al, Boss.

2461
02:34:37,638 --> 02:34:40,099
This is not one we'll come out on.

2462
02:34:40,182 --> 02:34:43,519
You remember the Hemingway story,
The Old Man and the Sea?

2463
02:34:44,395 --> 02:34:47,481
The old fisherman manages
to catch this great fish...

2464
02:34:48,024 --> 02:34:52,028
...a fish so huge, that he has to tie it
to the boat to get it back in.

2465
02:34:52,361 --> 02:34:54,155
By the time it reached shore...

2466
02:34:54,238 --> 02:34:57,408
...the fish had long since been picked apart
by sharks.

2467
02:35:01,037 --> 02:35:02,830
Nothing was left, but the skeleton.

2468
02:35:02,913 --> 02:35:06,876
- And that's what will happen to us.
- Then what did we do this for?

2469
02:35:06,959 --> 02:35:08,627
It's a means to an end.

2470
02:35:09,128 --> 02:35:11,088
This war has two fronts.

2471
02:35:12,506 --> 02:35:16,719
In a court of law,
we hope to get Clay Shaw for conspiracy.

2472
02:35:16,886 --> 02:35:20,806
In the court of public opinion,
it could take another 25, 30 years...

2473
02:35:21,015 --> 02:35:22,975
...for the truth to come out.

2474
02:35:25,061 --> 02:35:27,647
At least we'll strike the first blow.

2475
02:35:29,231 --> 02:35:30,775
What if you're wrong?

2476
02:35:34,862 --> 02:35:37,490
I never thought for a second I was.

2477
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:43,287
Will you come to the trial?

2478
02:35:44,830 --> 02:35:45,623
I don't think so.

2479
02:35:47,833 --> 02:35:53,339
With 53% of the precincts reporting,
Sen. Kennedy has a 48% to 41% lead...

2480
02:35:53,422 --> 02:35:55,007
...over Sen. McCarthy.

2481
02:35:55,132 --> 02:35:57,718
CBS News projects Sen. Robert Kennedy...

2482
02:35:57,802 --> 02:36:00,262
...the winner of the California primary.

2483
02:36:00,471 --> 02:36:04,684
Within the United States over the period
of the last three years...

2484
02:36:04,850 --> 02:36:09,230
...the division, the violence,
the disenchantment with our society...

2485
02:36:09,313 --> 02:36:11,649
...the divisions between blacks
and whites...

2486
02:36:11,732 --> 02:36:14,986
...the poor and the affluent,
between age groups...

2487
02:36:15,111 --> 02:36:17,655
...or Vietnam, we can work together.

2488
02:36:17,822 --> 02:36:21,701
We are a great country, an unselfish,
compassionate country.

2489
02:36:21,784 --> 02:36:24,537
That's my basis for running.

2490
02:36:28,416 --> 02:36:32,128
Thank you all.
It's on to Chicago and let's win there.

2491
02:36:45,057 --> 02:36:47,059
Senator Kennedy has been shot!

2492
02:37:29,894 --> 02:37:31,562
They killed him, honey.

2493
02:37:34,148 --> 02:37:35,483
He won...

2494
02:37:35,816 --> 02:37:38,152
...and they killed Robert Kennedy.

2495
02:37:40,154 --> 02:37:41,656
They shot him down.

2496
02:37:43,908 --> 02:37:45,326
Oh, my God!

2497
02:37:48,079 --> 02:37:49,497
Both of them?

2498
02:37:50,331 --> 02:37:51,874
Both brothers?

2499
02:37:57,254 --> 02:37:58,756
You were right.

2500
02:38:00,758 --> 02:38:02,593
It hasn't ended yet.

2501
02:38:10,267 --> 02:38:12,019
For the first time...

2502
02:38:13,688 --> 02:38:15,690
...I feel really scared.

2503
02:38:28,536 --> 02:38:30,871
I wish I could've loved you more.

2504
02:38:33,833 --> 02:38:38,295
Sometimes I feel like
I didn't ever love you...

2505
02:38:39,213 --> 02:38:41,215
...or the children enough.

2506
02:38:43,217 --> 02:38:44,552
I'm sorry.

2507
02:39:28,262 --> 02:39:29,597
Please rise.

2508
02:39:32,266 --> 02:39:36,979
The Criminal District Court for Orleans
Parish, Section H, is now in session.

2509
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:41,484
Honorable Judge Edward A. Haggerty, Jr.
presiding. Be seated.

2510
02:39:46,906 --> 02:39:48,324
That's Clay Bertrand.

2511
02:39:48,407 --> 02:39:50,368
That's who I saw at Ferrie's.

2512
02:39:50,493 --> 02:39:52,328
That's who you say you saw.

2513
02:39:53,496 --> 02:39:55,164
A confessed homosexual.

2514
02:39:56,332 --> 02:39:58,709
Convicted of pandering and soliciting.

2515
02:39:59,502 --> 02:40:01,837
A man who has lied about everything...

2516
02:40:02,338 --> 02:40:04,924
...and now wants to be taken at his word.

2517
02:40:05,007 --> 02:40:07,635
That man, right there. Yes, sir.

2518
02:40:07,927 --> 02:40:10,262
He was at the Pontchartrain wall...

2519
02:40:10,930 --> 02:40:13,349
...with the man who shot the President.

2520
02:40:14,225 --> 02:40:16,769
I remember him because of his limp.

2521
02:40:16,936 --> 02:40:19,855
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall.

2522
02:40:20,272 --> 02:40:22,566
Barely conscious of his surroundings.

2523
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:25,528
- Is that the man?
- That was the man, right there.

2524
02:40:25,778 --> 02:40:27,947
He dropped Oswald off on the voter's line.

2525
02:40:28,322 --> 02:40:31,867
I remember 'cause they were the only
white strangers around that day.

2526
02:40:31,951 --> 02:40:35,579
That big black Cadillac of his
made me think they might be FBl.

2527
02:40:35,788 --> 02:40:38,874
Welcome to Clinton.
If you need any help, let us know.

2528
02:40:38,958 --> 02:40:42,878
He said he was a representative
of Warren International Trade Mart.

2529
02:40:43,421 --> 02:40:46,090
More than five years ago,
for two minutes...?

2530
02:40:46,799 --> 02:40:49,051
It's fair to say you could be mistaken.

2531
02:40:49,135 --> 02:40:51,262
Just a figment of my imagination.

2532
02:40:51,512 --> 02:40:54,348
The cat's stewing you, I told him.

2533
02:40:54,473 --> 02:40:57,351
You got the right ta-ta,
but the wrong ho-ho.

2534
02:40:57,643 --> 02:41:01,397
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor.
And you can tell him I said so.

2535
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:02,606
Objection, Your Honor!

2536
02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:06,152
Andrews has been convicted of perjury
on this matter.

2537
02:41:06,235 --> 02:41:08,779
Exception taken. That case is on appeal.

2538
02:41:09,822 --> 02:41:11,115
Mr. Goldberg...

2539
02:41:11,532 --> 02:41:14,327
...you claim you met Ferrie and Shaw
on a vacation trip...

2540
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:16,662
...from your accounting business
in New York.

2541
02:41:16,746 --> 02:41:18,080
You had drinks...

2542
02:41:18,164 --> 02:41:20,499
...and while drunk,
discussed killing Kennedy.

2543
02:41:20,583 --> 02:41:22,626
- Is that not so?
- Yes, I did.

2544
02:41:22,793 --> 02:41:27,340
Is it also true that you fingerprinted
your daughter when she went to college?

2545
02:41:27,757 --> 02:41:28,924
Yes, sir, I did.

2546
02:41:29,008 --> 02:41:32,928
Is it also true that you fingerprinted her
when she returned?

2547
02:41:33,179 --> 02:41:34,305
Yes, I did.

2548
02:41:34,680 --> 02:41:35,723
Why?

2549
02:41:36,098 --> 02:41:39,352
I wanted to make sure
she was the same girl I sent away.

2550
02:41:42,563 --> 02:41:44,565
He was one of Broussard's witnesses.

2551
02:41:44,649 --> 02:41:47,360
He was totally sane
when we took his affidavit.

2552
02:41:47,443 --> 02:41:51,739
Your Honor, we call Police Officer
Aloysius Habighorst to the stand.

2553
02:41:52,281 --> 02:41:54,784
I must ask the jury to leave the court.

2554
02:41:54,950 --> 02:41:57,328
Gentlemen, will you please rise
and follow me.

2555
02:41:57,411 --> 02:42:00,414
- Name?
- Clay LaVerne Shaw.

2556
02:42:00,539 --> 02:42:02,667
Defendant didn't have his lawyer present.

2557
02:42:02,750 --> 02:42:05,878
It's standard booking procedure
to ask an alias!

2558
02:42:05,961 --> 02:42:07,421
I call them as I see them!

2559
02:42:07,505 --> 02:42:08,756
Any aliases?

2560
02:42:08,881 --> 02:42:10,132
Clay Bertrand.

2561
02:42:12,259 --> 02:42:16,013
It's not constitutionally required
that a lawyer be present!

2562
02:42:16,806 --> 02:42:19,809
- I'm ruling that inadmissible!
- That's our case!

2563
02:42:19,976 --> 02:42:22,186
Then you didn't have a case.

2564
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:25,690
I wouldn't believe anything
Habighorst said anyway.

2565
02:42:25,773 --> 02:42:27,817
I can't believe you're saying this!

2566
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:30,111
I am saying it. Bring in the jury.

2567
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:36,367
- Oswald?
- No, I did not.

2568
02:42:37,702 --> 02:42:40,955
- Ever call Dean Andrews?
- No, I did not.

2569
02:42:42,331 --> 02:42:44,709
Have you ever met David Ferrie?

2570
02:42:45,876 --> 02:42:49,547
Wouldn't even know what he looked like
if I hadn't seen pictures.

2571
02:42:50,798 --> 02:42:53,092
Did you ever use the alias, Clay Bertrand?

2572
02:42:53,217 --> 02:42:55,344
No, I did not.

2573
02:42:56,637 --> 02:42:58,472
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

2574
02:43:01,642 --> 02:43:04,895
A very great actor has just given us
a great performance.

2575
02:43:05,271 --> 02:43:07,732
But we are nowhere closer to the truth.

2576
02:43:08,274 --> 02:43:12,320
My office is charging Clay Shaw
with outright perjury...

2577
02:43:12,445 --> 02:43:16,824
...on 15 answers he's given today,
not one word being true.

2578
02:43:16,949 --> 02:43:19,493
You're out of order! Now, sit down!

2579
02:43:19,785 --> 02:43:21,662
That's the man right there.

2580
02:43:28,627 --> 02:43:31,797
To prove there was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw...

2581
02:43:32,298 --> 02:43:36,594
...we must prove there was more than
one man involved in the assassination.

2582
02:43:37,261 --> 02:43:38,346
To do that...

2583
02:43:38,471 --> 02:43:42,058
...we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office subpoenaed.

2584
02:43:42,808 --> 02:43:45,186
The American public has not seen...

2585
02:43:47,146 --> 02:43:52,652
...has not seen the film. It's been locked
in a vault the last five years...

2586
02:43:53,069 --> 02:43:55,613
...in the Time-Life Building in New York.

2587
02:43:56,614 --> 02:43:58,407
There's a reason for that.

2588
02:43:59,659 --> 02:44:00,576
Watch.

2589
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:53,254
"The picture speaks 1,000 words. "

2590
02:44:55,006 --> 02:44:58,175
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

2591
02:44:58,259 --> 02:45:00,136
Three bullets, one assassin.

2592
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:04,640
Two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it impossible.

2593
02:45:04,724 --> 02:45:10,229
One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder
while standing near the grassy knoll.

2594
02:45:10,896 --> 02:45:15,109
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment...

2595
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:17,945
...while standing near the triple underpass.

2596
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:21,657
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film...

2597
02:45:21,991 --> 02:45:24,452
...left no possibility of a fourth shot.

2598
02:45:24,910 --> 02:45:29,040
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek...

2599
02:45:29,332 --> 02:45:33,711
...came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

2600
02:45:34,462 --> 02:45:36,380
That leaves just two bullets.

2601
02:45:36,881 --> 02:45:40,259
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

2602
02:45:42,178 --> 02:45:43,971
So a single bullet remains.

2603
02:45:44,263 --> 02:45:48,934
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

2604
02:45:49,810 --> 02:45:52,938
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further...

2605
02:45:53,064 --> 02:45:55,483
...the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory...

2606
02:45:55,608 --> 02:45:58,903
...put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

2607
02:45:59,028 --> 02:46:02,448
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

2608
02:46:04,033 --> 02:46:06,494
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

2609
02:46:07,286 --> 02:46:08,746
The magic bullet...

2610
02:46:08,954 --> 02:46:13,334
...enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

2611
02:46:13,918 --> 02:46:18,631
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck...

2612
02:46:19,131 --> 02:46:20,675
...wound #2...

2613
02:46:21,133 --> 02:46:23,177
...where it waits 1.6 seconds...

2614
02:46:23,928 --> 02:46:27,723
...presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left...

2615
02:46:28,432 --> 02:46:30,309
...right, then left...

2616
02:46:30,768 --> 02:46:34,146
...and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

2617
02:46:34,438 --> 02:46:35,773
Wound #3.

2618
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:41,487
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib...

2619
02:46:41,946 --> 02:46:45,783
...and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound #4.

2620
02:46:46,450 --> 02:46:51,122
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

2621
02:46:51,914 --> 02:46:53,249
Wound #5.

2622
02:46:53,916 --> 02:46:55,835
Shattering the radius bone...

2623
02:46:55,918 --> 02:46:58,796
...the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound #6...

2624
02:46:59,296 --> 02:47:03,884
...makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

2625
02:47:04,218 --> 02:47:07,179
Wound #7, from which it later falls out...

2626
02:47:07,763 --> 02:47:10,516
...and is found
in almost pristine condition...

2627
02:47:10,933 --> 02:47:14,020
...on a stretcher in a corridor
of Parkland Hospital.

2628
02:47:16,522 --> 02:47:17,815
Some bullet.

2629
02:47:19,650 --> 02:47:22,862
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire...

2630
02:47:22,945 --> 02:47:25,573
...has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

2631
02:47:26,490 --> 02:47:31,329
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

2632
02:47:31,829 --> 02:47:33,331
Of course they can.

2633
02:47:33,414 --> 02:47:36,792
Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff...

2634
02:47:36,876 --> 02:47:39,045
...with his tail tied to a daisy.

2635
02:47:39,837 --> 02:47:42,214
But use your eyes, your common sense.

2636
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:47,136
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

2637
02:47:47,678 --> 02:47:50,264
Not one of them looked anything like this.

2638
02:47:51,807 --> 02:47:53,893
Take a look at CE-856.

2639
02:47:54,935 --> 02:47:56,562
An identical bullet...

2640
02:47:56,729 --> 02:47:59,565
...fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver...

2641
02:48:00,191 --> 02:48:03,277
...just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

2642
02:48:04,278 --> 02:48:05,988
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

2643
02:48:06,238 --> 02:48:07,573
Tough skin...

2644
02:48:08,032 --> 02:48:09,617
...dense bones.

2645
02:48:10,785 --> 02:48:12,953
This single-bullet explanation...

2646
02:48:13,162 --> 02:48:17,124
...is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

2647
02:48:17,708 --> 02:48:19,085
And once you conclude...

2648
02:48:19,168 --> 02:48:22,338
...the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds...

2649
02:48:22,505 --> 02:48:26,467
...you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

2650
02:48:28,052 --> 02:48:30,388
And if there was a second rifleman...

2651
02:48:30,805 --> 02:48:34,141
...then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy...

2652
02:48:34,558 --> 02:48:37,812
...which we believe
involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

2653
02:48:38,604 --> 02:48:43,734
Fifty-one witnesses thought
they heard shots from the grassy knoll...

2654
02:48:44,068 --> 02:48:47,154
...which is to the right,
in front of the President.

2655
02:48:48,239 --> 02:48:49,949
Key witnesses that day?

2656
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:52,952
Charles Brehm, a combat vet.

2657
02:48:53,577 --> 02:48:56,122
Right behind, Jean Hill and Mary Moorman.

2658
02:48:56,789 --> 02:48:59,458
S.M. Holland, Richard Dodd,
James Simmons...

2659
02:48:59,750 --> 02:49:02,378
...standing on the overpass. J.C. Price...

2660
02:49:02,461 --> 02:49:04,213
...overlooking the plaza.

2661
02:49:05,089 --> 02:49:07,842
William Newman, father of two children.

2662
02:49:08,009 --> 02:49:10,553
He hit the deck on the north side of Elm.

2663
02:49:11,804 --> 02:49:13,472
Abraham Zapruder.

2664
02:49:30,197 --> 02:49:33,284
Each of these key witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever...

2665
02:49:33,451 --> 02:49:36,620
...one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence.

2666
02:49:37,496 --> 02:49:40,791
Twenty-six trained medical personnel
at Parkland Hospital...

2667
02:49:40,875 --> 02:49:44,628
...saw the back of the President's head
blasted out!

2668
02:49:46,922 --> 02:49:48,466
Doctor Peters.

2669
02:49:49,008 --> 02:49:53,763
There was a large 7 cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

2670
02:49:53,888 --> 02:49:56,807
A considerable portion
of the brain was missing.

2671
02:49:58,351 --> 02:50:03,189
A fifth or possibly a quarter of the back
of the head had been blasted out...

2672
02:50:03,356 --> 02:50:05,566
...along with the underlying brain tissue.

2673
02:50:05,650 --> 02:50:08,235
When's the proper time
to declare one dead?

2674
02:50:08,694 --> 02:50:12,782
There was also a large fragment of skull
attached to a flap of the scalp.

2675
02:50:13,074 --> 02:50:17,078
The exit hole in the rear of his head
measured about 120 mm...

2676
02:50:17,203 --> 02:50:18,871
...or five inches, across.

2677
02:50:18,954 --> 02:50:22,917
Not one of the civilian doctors
who examined the President...

2678
02:50:23,334 --> 02:50:26,796
...regarded his throat wound as anything
but an entry wound.

2679
02:50:27,505 --> 02:50:31,092
But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

2680
02:50:31,175 --> 02:50:33,427
Because when a coup d'état has occurred...

2681
02:50:33,511 --> 02:50:37,932
...there's a big difference between
an autopsy performed by civilian doctors...

2682
02:50:38,015 --> 02:50:41,560
...and one that is performed
by military doctors under orders.

2683
02:50:42,687 --> 02:50:47,733
The departure of Air Force One, Friday
afternoon was not so much a takeoff...

2684
02:50:47,817 --> 02:50:51,028
...as it was a getaway,
with the newly sworn in President.

2685
02:50:51,112 --> 02:50:52,238
Objection!

2686
02:50:52,321 --> 02:50:53,280
Sustained.

2687
02:50:53,364 --> 02:50:57,952
On the plane, the White House Situation
Room announced Oswald's guilt...

2688
02:50:58,035 --> 02:51:01,831
...to all passengers before any kind
of investigation had begun.

2689
02:51:02,081 --> 02:51:05,042
The "angry lone nut" solution
is beginning to take shape.

2690
02:51:05,126 --> 02:51:07,670
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

2691
02:51:09,463 --> 02:51:11,424
Please bottle the acid.

2692
02:51:13,551 --> 02:51:18,431
The three Bethesda doctors picked by
the military left something to be desired.

2693
02:51:18,556 --> 02:51:22,184
None of them had experience
with combat-gunfire wounds.

2694
02:51:22,601 --> 02:51:27,106
Through their autopsy, we've been able
to justify eight wounds from two bullets.

2695
02:51:27,231 --> 02:51:29,608
Three to Kennedy, five to Connally.

2696
02:51:29,692 --> 02:51:32,028
One of them being the "magic bullet. "

2697
02:51:32,194 --> 02:51:33,654
- FBl?
- Here.

2698
02:51:33,738 --> 02:51:37,533
Col. Finck, are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck?

2699
02:51:37,616 --> 02:51:40,911
I was told the family wanted
the examination of the head.

2700
02:51:41,662 --> 02:51:42,913
Oh, Christ.

2701
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:44,832
Looks like half his brain is gone.

2702
02:51:44,915 --> 02:51:47,251
- Weigh it.
-653 grams.

2703
02:51:47,335 --> 02:51:50,463
As a pathologist, it was your obligation
to explore...

2704
02:51:50,546 --> 02:51:52,423
...all possible causes of death.

2705
02:51:52,506 --> 02:51:54,091
I had the cause of death.

2706
02:51:54,175 --> 02:51:57,595
Your Honor, please direct the witness
to answer my question.

2707
02:51:58,554 --> 02:52:01,849
Why did Col. Finck not dissect
the tract of the bullet wound?

2708
02:52:01,932 --> 02:52:03,934
I heard Dr. Humes stating...

2709
02:52:04,185 --> 02:52:06,270
That's enough. That's enough.

2710
02:52:06,395 --> 02:52:07,813
It's duly noted.

2711
02:52:08,272 --> 02:52:09,940
Let's check the back.

2712
02:52:17,615 --> 02:52:19,992
I can feel the end of the wound
with my finger.

2713
02:52:20,076 --> 02:52:21,994
That won't be necessary.

2714
02:52:24,789 --> 02:52:26,332
Watch the ear!

2715
02:52:27,708 --> 02:52:30,044
Shot in the back. Cheap crime.

2716
02:52:30,336 --> 02:52:31,337
He said:

2717
02:52:31,587 --> 02:52:33,297
Who's in charge here?

2718
02:52:33,673 --> 02:52:34,757
I am.

2719
02:52:36,050 --> 02:52:37,510
I don't remember his name.

2720
02:52:38,177 --> 02:52:39,804
It was quite crowded.

2721
02:52:40,221 --> 02:52:43,975
And when you are called to look
at the wounds of the dead President...

2722
02:52:44,058 --> 02:52:47,144
...you don't ask people for their names
and who they are.

2723
02:52:47,228 --> 02:52:51,399
But you were a qualified pathologist.
Was the Army General?

2724
02:52:51,941 --> 02:52:52,775
No.

2725
02:52:53,651 --> 02:52:55,027
But you took his orders.

2726
02:52:55,695 --> 02:52:56,570
Yes.

2727
02:52:56,737 --> 02:52:59,156
- So he was directing the autopsy.
- No.

2728
02:52:59,407 --> 02:53:01,492
There were others.

2729
02:53:02,326 --> 02:53:03,869
There were admirals.

2730
02:53:06,122 --> 02:53:09,083
When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,
you follow orders.

2731
02:53:09,166 --> 02:53:13,754
It is not our business to discuss this
with anyone outside this room.

2732
02:53:13,838 --> 02:53:16,841
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General...

2733
02:53:17,174 --> 02:53:20,428
...specifically told us
not to discuss the case.

2734
02:53:23,264 --> 02:53:26,350
A lot of people were deciding
what was private...

2735
02:53:26,851 --> 02:53:29,437
...none of the American people's business.

2736
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,605
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...

2737
02:53:31,689 --> 02:53:35,234
...by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

2738
02:53:35,568 --> 02:53:38,362
President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine...

2739
02:53:38,446 --> 02:53:42,033
...filled with bullet holes and clues
to be washed and rebuilt.

2740
02:53:42,366 --> 02:53:45,202
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

2741
02:53:46,370 --> 02:53:50,333
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

2742
02:53:51,459 --> 02:53:55,838
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain...

2743
02:53:56,255 --> 02:53:59,717
...in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came...

2744
02:53:59,800 --> 02:54:01,135
...we're told...

2745
02:54:01,969 --> 02:54:05,973
...by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

2746
02:54:09,393 --> 02:54:13,022
That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept of justice.

2747
02:54:13,105 --> 02:54:17,652
Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting
the federal government-

2748
02:54:18,319 --> 02:54:19,945
Overruled!

2749
02:54:26,994 --> 02:54:29,163
So, what really happened that day?

2750
02:54:29,747 --> 02:54:32,375
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

2751
02:54:32,833 --> 02:54:35,670
We have the epileptic seizure...

2752
02:54:35,753 --> 02:54:39,757
...distracting the police and allowing
the shooters to get into place.

2753
02:54:40,758 --> 02:54:44,845
The epileptic later vanished,
never checking into the hospital.

2754
02:54:46,097 --> 02:54:49,183
The A-team goes to the sixth floor
of the Depository.

2755
02:54:49,350 --> 02:54:52,520
They were refurbishing the floors
of the Depository that week...

2756
02:54:52,603 --> 02:54:55,231
...allowing unknown workmen
in the building.

2757
02:54:55,940 --> 02:54:59,443
They move quickly into position,
minutes before the shooting.

2758
02:54:59,986 --> 02:55:04,573
The second spotter, talking by radio to
the other teams, has the best overall view.

2759
02:55:05,199 --> 02:55:06,450
The God spot.

2760
02:55:06,826 --> 02:55:11,622
B- team, one rifleman and one spotter
with access to the building...

2761
02:55:11,872 --> 02:55:14,792
...moves into a low floor
of the Dal-Tex building.

2762
02:55:15,793 --> 02:55:20,548
The third team, C-team, moves in
behind the fence above the grassy knoll...

2763
02:55:20,881 --> 02:55:25,469
...where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.

2764
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:28,222
They have the best position.

2765
02:55:28,806 --> 02:55:31,934
Kennedy is close and on a flat,
low trajectory.

2766
02:55:32,476 --> 02:55:34,478
Part of this team is a coordinator...

2767
02:55:34,562 --> 02:55:38,899
...who flashed security credentials
at people, chasing them from the area.

2768
02:55:39,984 --> 02:55:43,738
Probably two to three more men
are in the crowd.

2769
02:55:44,071 --> 02:55:47,700
Ten to twelve men.
Three teams. Three shooters.

2770
02:55:48,242 --> 02:55:52,913
The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and
David Ferrie discussed two months before.

2771
02:55:53,956 --> 02:55:55,666
They blocked the plaza.

2772
02:55:56,083 --> 02:55:57,877
They know every inch.

2773
02:55:59,795 --> 02:56:03,549
They've calibrated their sights.
Practiced on moving targets.

2774
02:56:04,675 --> 02:56:05,926
They're ready.

2775
02:56:06,761 --> 02:56:10,056
Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn
from Main onto Houston.

2776
02:56:11,015 --> 02:56:13,100
It's going to be a turkey shoot.

2777
02:56:14,769 --> 02:56:16,854
They don't shoot him on Houston...

2778
02:56:16,937 --> 02:56:20,316
...the easiest shot for a single shooter
in the Depository.

2779
02:56:20,691 --> 02:56:24,445
They wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles.

2780
02:56:25,696 --> 02:56:28,783
Kennedy makes the turn
from Houston onto Elm.

2781
02:56:29,617 --> 02:56:32,995
Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.

2782
02:56:33,704 --> 02:56:37,541
The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim.

2783
02:56:39,335 --> 02:56:43,089
Waiting for the radio to say,
"Green! Green! "

2784
02:56:43,464 --> 02:56:45,841
Or, "Abort! Abort! "

2785
02:56:52,139 --> 02:56:53,891
The first shot rings out.

2786
02:56:54,809 --> 02:56:57,979
Sounding like a backfire,
it misses the car completely.

2787
02:56:58,437 --> 02:57:01,524
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

2788
02:57:02,066 --> 02:57:04,735
Connally's head turns slightly to the right.

2789
02:57:05,027 --> 02:57:08,948
Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy
in the throat from the front.

2790
02:57:09,740 --> 02:57:13,077
Frame 225, Kennedy emerges
from behind the road sign.

2791
02:57:13,411 --> 02:57:16,831
He's been hit, raising his hands
to his throat.

2792
02:57:17,498 --> 02:57:19,750
The third shot, frame 232...

2793
02:57:19,959 --> 02:57:23,504
...hits Kennedy in the back,
pulling him downward and forward.

2794
02:57:23,838 --> 02:57:27,008
Connally, you will notice,
shows no sign of being hit.

2795
02:57:27,258 --> 02:57:31,345
He is holding his Stetson, which is
impossible if his wrist is shattered.

2796
02:57:31,429 --> 02:57:33,264
Connally is turning now.

2797
02:57:33,347 --> 02:57:35,808
Frame 238. The fourth shot.

2798
02:57:35,933 --> 02:57:39,228
It misses Kennedy and takes Connally
in the back.

2799
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:42,440
This is the shot that proves
there were two rifles.

2800
02:57:42,523 --> 02:57:46,027
Connally yells, "My God!
They're going to kill us all! "

2801
02:57:46,277 --> 02:57:49,655
Around this time,
another shot misses the car completely...

2802
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:52,366
...striking James Teague by the underpass.

2803
02:57:53,284 --> 02:57:54,535
The car brakes.

2804
02:57:54,785 --> 02:57:56,537
The sixth and fatal shot.

2805
02:57:56,704 --> 02:58:00,166
Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head
from the front.

2806
02:58:01,667 --> 02:58:03,336
This is the key shot.

2807
02:58:03,961 --> 02:58:06,964
The President going back and to his left...

2808
02:58:07,173 --> 02:58:09,342
...shot from the front and right.

2809
02:58:10,301 --> 02:58:13,721
Totally inconsistent with the shot
from the Depository.

2810
02:58:13,888 --> 02:58:14,847
Again.

2811
02:58:18,768 --> 02:58:20,686
Back, and to the left.

2812
02:58:22,104 --> 02:58:23,939
Back, and to the left.

2813
02:58:25,316 --> 02:58:27,109
Back, and to the left.

2814
02:58:29,487 --> 02:58:31,322
So what happens then?

2815
02:58:33,741 --> 02:58:34,992
Pandemonium.

2816
02:58:37,912 --> 02:58:39,830
Let's go! We got him!

2817
02:58:45,336 --> 02:58:50,132
The shooters quickly disassemble their
various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.

2818
02:59:01,268 --> 02:59:04,689
Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot
behind the fence.

2819
02:59:05,356 --> 02:59:06,774
He smells gunpowder.

2820
02:59:06,857 --> 02:59:10,611
He produced credentials showing him
to be Secret Service.

2821
02:59:11,696 --> 02:59:14,365
Let's see your ID.
See anyone else up here?

2822
02:59:15,533 --> 02:59:17,910
I accepted that and let him go.

2823
02:59:18,869 --> 02:59:21,914
I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.

2824
02:59:22,707 --> 02:59:26,877
He had on a sports shirt and pants,
but he had dirty fingernails.

2825
02:59:28,713 --> 02:59:31,632
Afterward, it didn't ring true.
But at the time...

2826
02:59:31,716 --> 02:59:33,759
...we were so pressed for time.

2827
02:59:34,635 --> 02:59:37,638
All Secret Servicemen
in Dallas are accounted for.

2828
02:59:38,431 --> 02:59:41,684
None were on foot in Dealey Plaza
before or after the shooting...

2829
02:59:41,767 --> 02:59:45,604
...till the Dallas Secret Service chief
returned at 12:55.

2830
02:59:46,397 --> 02:59:50,234
The Dallas police took at least 12 people
into custody.

2831
02:59:51,235 --> 02:59:52,862
No record of their arrest.

2832
02:59:52,945 --> 02:59:56,615
Men acting like hoboes
were pulled off trains...

2833
02:59:56,824 --> 02:59:59,285
...marched through Dealey Plaza,
photographed.

2834
02:59:59,410 --> 03:00:01,620
Yet there's no record of their arrest.

2835
03:00:01,746 --> 03:00:05,499
Men identifying themselves
as Secret Service agents were everywhere.

2836
03:00:06,417 --> 03:00:08,461
But who was impersonating them?

2837
03:00:08,753 --> 03:00:10,338
Where was Oswald?

2838
03:00:11,005 --> 03:00:15,259
Around 12:15, leaving the building
to see the motorcade...

2839
03:00:15,343 --> 03:00:18,429
...Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald
in the second-floor snack room...

2840
03:00:18,512 --> 03:00:20,723
...where he said he went for a Coke.

2841
03:00:21,432 --> 03:00:24,685
He was in a booth on the right side
of the room.

2842
03:00:25,186 --> 03:00:28,856
He was by himself as usual,
appeared to be having lunch.

2843
03:00:29,190 --> 03:00:32,193
I didn't speak to him,
but I recognized him clearly.

2844
03:00:32,526 --> 03:00:37,156
At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is
supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.

2845
03:00:37,698 --> 03:00:40,534
He's there until 12:15, maybe 12:20.

2846
03:00:41,327 --> 03:00:42,870
He sees nobody.

2847
03:00:43,537 --> 03:00:48,000
Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,
sees two men in the sixth-floor windows...

2848
03:00:48,084 --> 03:00:51,587
...presumably after Williams
finished his lunch and left.

2849
03:00:52,213 --> 03:00:56,133
John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor
of the county jail, sees them.

2850
03:00:56,217 --> 03:00:57,677
Many of us saw them.

2851
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:01,681
Everyone was hollering and yelling.
We thought they was security guys.

2852
03:01:02,390 --> 03:01:07,019
If Oswald was the assassin, he was
nonchalant about moving into position.

2853
03:01:07,645 --> 03:01:11,232
Later, he told police he was
in the second-floor snack room.

2854
03:01:11,524 --> 03:01:14,694
Probably told to wait there
by his handler for a call.

2855
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:18,364
But the phone call never came.

2856
03:01:18,990 --> 03:01:21,659
Maximum 90 seconds
after Kennedy is shot...

2857
03:01:21,742 --> 03:01:25,663
...Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald
in that second-floor lunchroom.

2858
03:01:27,164 --> 03:01:28,791
Is this man an employee?

2859
03:01:28,916 --> 03:01:31,669
Yes. The President's been shot.

2860
03:01:31,794 --> 03:01:33,838
The Commission would have us believe...

2861
03:01:33,921 --> 03:01:37,425
...that after firing three bolt-action shots
in 5.6 seconds...

2862
03:01:37,925 --> 03:01:42,388
...Oswald then leaves three cartridges
neatly side-by-side in the firing nest...

2863
03:01:42,596 --> 03:01:47,143
...wipes fingerprints off the rifle,
stashes it on the other side of the loft...

2864
03:01:48,185 --> 03:01:50,479
...sprints down five flights of stairs...

2865
03:01:50,604 --> 03:01:54,066
...past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles
who never see him...

2866
03:01:54,859 --> 03:01:59,322
...then shows up, cool and calm, on the
second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.

2867
03:02:00,865 --> 03:02:04,035
All this within a maximum of 90 seconds
of the shooting.

2868
03:02:04,785 --> 03:02:06,787
Is this man an employee?

2869
03:02:06,912 --> 03:02:08,956
Yes. The President's been shot.

2870
03:02:09,123 --> 03:02:10,666
Is he out of breath?

2871
03:02:11,125 --> 03:02:13,669
According to Baker, absolutely not.

2872
03:02:14,045 --> 03:02:18,966
Assuming he is the sole assassin,
Oswald is free to leave the building.

2873
03:02:19,634 --> 03:02:24,013
The longer he delays, the more chance
the building will be sealed by police.

2874
03:02:24,889 --> 03:02:28,225
Is he guilty? Does he walk
out the nearest staircase?

2875
03:02:30,394 --> 03:02:32,104
He buys a Coke...

2876
03:02:32,355 --> 03:02:36,567
...and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid
on the second floor...

2877
03:02:36,984 --> 03:02:39,487
...he strolls out
the more distant front exit...

2878
03:02:39,612 --> 03:02:41,238
...where cops have gathered.

2879
03:02:41,364 --> 03:02:44,408
Odd, since three shots were fired
from there...

2880
03:02:44,533 --> 03:02:47,495
...nobody seals the Depository
for ten more minutes.

2881
03:02:47,912 --> 03:02:50,831
Oswald slips out,
as do several other employees.

2882
03:02:51,165 --> 03:02:55,211
When he realized something had gone
wrong and Kennedy had been killed...

2883
03:02:55,753 --> 03:02:59,674
...he knew there was a problem.
Maybe even that he was the patsy.

2884
03:03:00,174 --> 03:03:04,387
An intuition, maybe. The President killed
in spite of his warning.

2885
03:03:04,470 --> 03:03:06,389
The phone call that never came.

2886
03:03:06,514 --> 03:03:09,809
Perhaps fear now came to Oswald
for the very first time.

2887
03:03:11,435 --> 03:03:14,689
Oswald returns to his rooming house
around 1:00 p. m...

2888
03:03:14,814 --> 03:03:17,191
...a half hour after the assassination.

2889
03:03:17,441 --> 03:03:19,110
A man shot the President!

2890
03:03:19,235 --> 03:03:22,196
He puts on his jacket,
grabs his. 38 revolver...

2891
03:03:22,363 --> 03:03:24,240
...and leaves at 1:04.

2892
03:03:24,865 --> 03:03:27,952
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,
heard two beeps on a car horn.

2893
03:03:28,077 --> 03:03:31,580
Two uniformed cops pulled up
while Oswald was in his room.

2894
03:03:31,706 --> 03:03:33,249
Like it was a signal.

2895
03:03:34,375 --> 03:03:38,796
Officer Tippit is shot between 1:10
and 1:15, a mile away.

2896
03:03:38,963 --> 03:03:41,549
And though no one saw him walking...

2897
03:03:41,799 --> 03:03:44,593
...the government says
Oswald covered that distance.

2898
03:03:44,719 --> 03:03:47,221
Giving the government the benefit
of the doubt...

2899
03:03:47,305 --> 03:03:50,433
...Oswald would've had to jog a mile
in six to eleven minutes...

2900
03:03:50,558 --> 03:03:53,311
...then commit the murder,
reverse his direction...

2901
03:03:53,394 --> 03:03:56,439
...and walk three-fifths of a mile
to the Texas Theater...

2902
03:03:56,522 --> 03:03:59,108
...and arrive sometime before 1:30.

2903
03:04:04,530 --> 03:04:06,240
It's also a useful conclusion.

2904
03:04:06,324 --> 03:04:08,868
After all, why would Oswald
kill Officer Tippit...

2905
03:04:08,951 --> 03:04:12,121
...unless he just shot the President
and feared arrest?

2906
03:04:12,705 --> 03:04:14,540
Domingo Benevides...

2907
03:04:16,125 --> 03:04:18,377
...the closest witness to the shooting...

2908
03:04:18,461 --> 03:04:22,715
...refused to identify Oswald as the killer
and was never taken to a lineup.

2909
03:04:23,174 --> 03:04:24,342
Acquilla Clemons...

2910
03:04:24,425 --> 03:04:28,304
...saw the killer and another man
go off in separate directions.

2911
03:04:28,638 --> 03:04:32,308
Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup
or to the Warren Commission.

2912
03:04:32,933 --> 03:04:36,979
At the scene, Officer Poe marks
his initials on the shells...

2913
03:04:37,104 --> 03:04:39,315
...to record the chain of evidence.

2914
03:04:39,690 --> 03:04:42,610
Those initials are not
on the three cartridge cases...

2915
03:04:42,693 --> 03:04:45,196
...which the Warren Commission show him.

2916
03:04:45,529 --> 03:04:49,492
As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes
after the assassination...

2917
03:04:50,034 --> 03:04:54,205
...the police put out a description
matching Oswald's size and build.

2918
03:04:54,872 --> 03:04:59,752
Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,
Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.

2919
03:05:00,503 --> 03:05:05,132
Oswald is scared. He begins to realize
the full implications of this thing.

2920
03:05:05,216 --> 03:05:09,011
He goes to the Texas Theater,
possibly a prearranged meeting point.

2921
03:05:09,303 --> 03:05:14,016
Though he has $14 in his pocket,
he doesn't buy the $0.75 ticket.

2922
03:05:14,350 --> 03:05:16,644
Brewer has the cashier call the police.

2923
03:05:16,727 --> 03:05:18,896
In response to that call...

2924
03:05:19,313 --> 03:05:23,651
...at least 30 officers in patrol cars
descend on the movie theater.

2925
03:05:23,985 --> 03:05:27,321
This is the most remarkable example
of police intuition...

2926
03:05:27,488 --> 03:05:29,657
...since the Reichstag fire.

2927
03:05:30,408 --> 03:05:31,701
I don't buy it!

2928
03:05:31,826 --> 03:05:35,997
They knew. Someone knew
Oswald would be there.

2929
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:39,000
Brewer leads the cops into the theater...

2930
03:05:39,083 --> 03:05:41,210
...and from the stage, points Oswald out.

2931
03:05:41,294 --> 03:05:42,378
There he is.

2932
03:05:54,765 --> 03:05:57,143
Sir, can I get you to stand up?

2933
03:06:03,024 --> 03:06:07,570
I am not resisting arrest!
I am not resisting arrest!

2934
03:06:07,695 --> 03:06:09,238
They have their man.

2935
03:06:10,239 --> 03:06:13,117
It's already been decided in Washington.

2936
03:06:13,909 --> 03:06:16,454
When he is brought from the theater...

2937
03:06:16,746 --> 03:06:19,123
...a crowd is waiting to scream at him.

2938
03:06:19,373 --> 03:06:22,918
Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.
in Kafka's The Trial.

2939
03:06:23,044 --> 03:06:25,379
He's never given reasons for his arrest.

2940
03:06:25,463 --> 03:06:28,633
He doesn't know the unseen forces
ranging against him.

2941
03:06:29,133 --> 03:06:32,887
At police headquarters, he was booked
for murdering Tippit.

2942
03:06:33,054 --> 03:06:34,889
No legal counsel was provided.

2943
03:06:34,972 --> 03:06:37,141
No record made of the questioning.

2944
03:06:37,308 --> 03:06:40,019
When the sun rises the next morning...

2945
03:06:40,144 --> 03:06:42,772
...he is booked for murdering the President.

2946
03:06:42,855 --> 03:06:46,817
The whole country, fueled by the media,
assumes he is guilty.

2947
03:06:47,401 --> 03:06:49,695
Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...

2948
03:06:49,779 --> 03:06:53,199
...out to spare Jackie Kennedy
from testifying at a trial...

2949
03:06:53,908 --> 03:06:56,410
...Jack Ruby is let into a garage...

2950
03:06:56,494 --> 03:06:59,413
...by one of his inside men
on the police force.

2951
03:07:00,289 --> 03:07:04,126
Oswald is brought out
like a sacrificial lamb...

2952
03:07:04,251 --> 03:07:07,421
...and nicely disposed of as an enemy
of the people.

2953
03:07:26,065 --> 03:07:28,025
Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...

2954
03:07:28,943 --> 03:07:31,821
...buried in a cheap grave
under the name Oswald?

2955
03:07:32,905 --> 03:07:33,906
Nobody.

2956
03:07:41,622 --> 03:07:46,377
False statements and press leaks
about Oswald circulate the globe.

2957
03:07:47,545 --> 03:07:50,798
The official legend is created
and the media takes it from there.

2958
03:07:52,341 --> 03:07:56,304
The glitter of official lies
and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...

2959
03:07:56,387 --> 03:07:59,724
...confuse the eye
and confound the understanding.

2960
03:08:01,017 --> 03:08:02,476
Hitler said:

2961
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:06,314
"The bigger the lie,
the more people will believe it. "

2962
03:08:07,690 --> 03:08:11,235
Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed,
lonely man who wanted attention...

2963
03:08:11,319 --> 03:08:15,865
...and got it by killing a President was
only the first in a long line of patsies.

2964
03:08:16,574 --> 03:08:19,535
In later years, Bobby Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

2965
03:08:19,618 --> 03:08:22,288
...men whose commitment
to change and peace...

2966
03:08:22,371 --> 03:08:25,958
...made them dangerous to men
committed to war, would follow...

2967
03:08:26,500 --> 03:08:29,420
...also killed by such lonely, crazed men.

2968
03:08:30,338 --> 03:08:34,634
Men who remove all guilt by making
murder a meaningless act of a loner.

2969
03:08:35,968 --> 03:08:40,306
We've all become Hamlets in our country,
children of a slain father-leader...

2970
03:08:40,431 --> 03:08:43,017
...whose killers still possess the throne.

2971
03:08:43,225 --> 03:08:46,937
The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us
with the secret murder...

2972
03:08:47,021 --> 03:08:49,273
...at the heart of the American Dream.

2973
03:08:49,357 --> 03:08:53,819
He forces on us the appalling questions:
Of what is our Constitution made?

2974
03:08:54,654 --> 03:08:56,947
What are our lives worth?

2975
03:08:57,031 --> 03:08:59,033
What is the future of a democracy...

2976
03:08:59,116 --> 03:09:03,412
...where a President can be assassinated
under suspicious circumstances...

2977
03:09:03,496 --> 03:09:06,791
...while the machinery of legal action
scarcely trembles?

2978
03:09:07,917 --> 03:09:11,420
How many more political murders
disguised as heart attacks...

2979
03:09:11,671 --> 03:09:14,215
...suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?

2980
03:09:14,298 --> 03:09:16,968
How many plane and car crashes
will occur...

2981
03:09:17,134 --> 03:09:19,804
...before they are exposed
for what they are?

2982
03:09:21,472 --> 03:09:24,517
"Treason doth never prosper,"
wrote an English poet.

2983
03:09:25,184 --> 03:09:26,727
"What's the reason?

2984
03:09:27,436 --> 03:09:30,189
"For if it prosper,
none dare call it treason. "

2985
03:09:30,815 --> 03:09:33,901
The American public has yet
to see the Zapruder film.

2986
03:09:34,443 --> 03:09:35,528
Why?

2987
03:09:36,028 --> 03:09:40,241
The American public has yet to see
the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.

2988
03:09:40,324 --> 03:09:41,242
Why?

2989
03:09:42,284 --> 03:09:45,496
Hundreds of documents could help prove
this conspiracy.

2990
03:09:45,579 --> 03:09:48,791
Why are they being withheld
or burned by the government?

2991
03:09:49,792 --> 03:09:54,422
When my office or you, the people, asked
those questions, demanded evidence...

2992
03:09:54,505 --> 03:09:58,426
...the answer from on high
has always been: national security.

2993
03:09:59,510 --> 03:10:03,723
What kind of national security do we have
when we're robbed of our leaders?

2994
03:10:04,223 --> 03:10:06,684
What national security
permits the removal...

2995
03:10:06,767 --> 03:10:09,270
...of fundamental power from the people...

2996
03:10:09,353 --> 03:10:13,274
...and validates the ascendancy
of an invisible government in the US?

2997
03:10:14,608 --> 03:10:16,610
That kind of national security is...

2998
03:10:16,694 --> 03:10:20,239
...when it smells like it, feels like it,
and looks like it...

2999
03:10:20,865 --> 03:10:22,658
...you call it what it is:

3000
03:10:23,034 --> 03:10:24,327
Fascism!

3001
03:10:26,495 --> 03:10:31,542
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22, 1963...

3002
03:10:31,667 --> 03:10:33,294
...was a coup d'etat.

3003
03:10:34,045 --> 03:10:36,297
Its most direct and tragic result...

3004
03:10:36,547 --> 03:10:40,551
...was the reversal of Kennedy's decision
to withdraw from Vietnam.

3005
03:10:41,886 --> 03:10:44,472
The war is the biggest business
in America...

3006
03:10:44,555 --> 03:10:46,724
...worth $80 billion a year.

3007
03:10:47,850 --> 03:10:50,645
President Kennedy was murdered
by a conspiracy...

3008
03:10:50,728 --> 03:10:53,648
...planned at the highest levels
of our government...

3009
03:10:53,731 --> 03:10:57,318
...carried out by fanatical
and disciplined cold warriors...

3010
03:10:57,485 --> 03:11:00,988
...in the Pentagon and CIA's
covert-operation apparatus.

3011
03:11:01,072 --> 03:11:03,699
Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

3012
03:11:04,533 --> 03:11:07,745
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by...

3013
03:11:07,828 --> 03:11:10,831
...like-minded people
in the Dallas Police...

3014
03:11:10,957 --> 03:11:14,210
...the Secret Service, the FBl,
and the White House...

3015
03:11:14,293 --> 03:11:18,172
...up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson...

3016
03:11:18,631 --> 03:11:21,050
...who were accomplices after the fact.

3017
03:11:21,634 --> 03:11:25,638
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

3018
03:11:26,347 --> 03:11:31,644
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace...

3019
03:11:32,186 --> 03:11:34,939
...while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress...

3020
03:11:35,022 --> 03:11:37,066
...for the military and their contractors.

3021
03:11:39,443 --> 03:11:41,570
Some people say I'm crazy.

3022
03:11:43,072 --> 03:11:46,033
Southern caricature seeking higher office.

3023
03:11:48,202 --> 03:11:51,205
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

3024
03:11:51,414 --> 03:11:54,375
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination...

3025
03:11:54,458 --> 03:11:58,379
...former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon...

3026
03:11:58,546 --> 03:12:03,259
...to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

3027
03:12:04,176 --> 03:12:05,886
Or the secret CIA memo...

3028
03:12:06,012 --> 03:12:10,433
...on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

3029
03:12:10,599 --> 03:12:12,393
These documents are yours.

3030
03:12:13,060 --> 03:12:15,438
The people's property. You pay for it.

3031
03:12:16,230 --> 03:12:18,482
But as the government sees you
as children...

3032
03:12:18,566 --> 03:12:21,777
...who might be too disturbed
to face this reality...

3033
03:12:22,445 --> 03:12:25,197
...or because you might lynch
those involved...

3034
03:12:26,157 --> 03:12:29,327
...you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

3035
03:12:30,369 --> 03:12:32,038
I'm in my 40s...

3036
03:12:33,247 --> 03:12:36,083
...so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

3037
03:12:36,167 --> 03:12:40,671
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit...

3038
03:12:41,547 --> 03:12:45,468
...so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038...

3039
03:12:45,593 --> 03:12:50,765
...he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.

3040
03:12:52,141 --> 03:12:54,060
They may push it back then.

3041
03:12:54,143 --> 03:12:59,106
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

3042
03:12:59,523 --> 03:13:03,444
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

3043
03:13:04,528 --> 03:13:05,655
We better.

3044
03:13:06,781 --> 03:13:10,618
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government...

3045
03:13:10,910 --> 03:13:15,247
...like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

3046
03:13:15,456 --> 03:13:17,166
Just a bit farther out West.

3047
03:13:19,001 --> 03:13:20,962
An American naturalist wrote:

3048
03:13:21,295 --> 03:13:24,507
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country...

3049
03:13:24,757 --> 03:13:26,676
"... against its government. "

3050
03:13:28,302 --> 03:13:30,513
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

3051
03:13:31,180 --> 03:13:35,393
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

3052
03:13:37,019 --> 03:13:39,438
Going back to when we were children...

3053
03:13:40,147 --> 03:13:44,902
...I think most of us in this courtroom
thought justice came automatically.

3054
03:13:46,112 --> 03:13:48,155
That virtue was its own reward.

3055
03:13:48,239 --> 03:13:50,241
That good triumphs over evil.

3056
03:13:51,409 --> 03:13:54,245
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

3057
03:13:55,204 --> 03:13:59,375
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy...

3058
03:14:00,835 --> 03:14:03,921
...because the truth often poses a threat
to power...

3059
03:14:04,338 --> 03:14:07,967
...and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

3060
03:14:08,175 --> 03:14:10,094
People like S.M. Holland...

3061
03:14:10,678 --> 03:14:12,054
...Lee Bowers...

3062
03:14:12,555 --> 03:14:14,265
...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...

3063
03:14:14,348 --> 03:14:17,643
...have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

3064
03:14:17,810 --> 03:14:20,813
I have here some $8,000 in these letters...

3065
03:14:21,772 --> 03:14:24,025
...sent from all over the country.

3066
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:27,069
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...

3067
03:14:27,737 --> 03:14:30,573
...plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

3068
03:14:31,782 --> 03:14:34,994
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

3069
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:37,955
People who drive cabs...

3070
03:14:38,497 --> 03:14:40,124
...who nurse in hospitals...

3071
03:14:40,207 --> 03:14:42,835
...who see their kids go to Vietnam.

3072
03:14:44,003 --> 03:14:45,087
Why?

3073
03:14:46,631 --> 03:14:48,132
Because they care.

3074
03:14:49,050 --> 03:14:51,302
Because they want to know the truth.

3075
03:14:51,844 --> 03:14:53,971
Because they want their country back.

3076
03:14:54,055 --> 03:14:56,223
Because it still belongs to us...

3077
03:14:56,557 --> 03:15:00,645
...as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

3078
03:15:02,980 --> 03:15:07,318
The truth is the most important value
we have, because if it doesn't endure...

3079
03:15:08,069 --> 03:15:09,987
...if the government murders truth...

3080
03:15:10,071 --> 03:15:12,365
...if we cannot respect these people...

3081
03:15:12,448 --> 03:15:17,495
...then this is not the country I was
born in, or the country I want to die in.

3082
03:15:19,372 --> 03:15:20,665
Tennyson wrote:

3083
03:15:20,748 --> 03:15:22,917
"Authority forgets a dying king. "

3084
03:15:24,669 --> 03:15:27,296
This was never more true
than for John F. Kennedy...

3085
03:15:27,380 --> 03:15:31,008
...whose murder was probably one
of the most terrible moments...

3086
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:33,469
...in the history of our country.

3087
03:15:35,972 --> 03:15:39,976
We, the people, the jury system sitting
in judgment on Clay Shaw...

3088
03:15:41,811 --> 03:15:43,521
...represent the hope...

3089
03:15:43,604 --> 03:15:46,107
...of humanity against government power.

3090
03:15:47,441 --> 03:15:49,276
In discharging your duty...

3091
03:15:49,986 --> 03:15:53,239
...to bring a first conviction
in this house of cards...

3092
03:15:53,614 --> 03:15:55,324
...against Clay Shaw...

3093
03:15:55,908 --> 03:16:00,538
"... ask not what your country can do for
you but what you can do for your country. "

3094
03:16:01,122 --> 03:16:02,623
Do not forget...

3095
03:16:03,291 --> 03:16:05,084
...your dying king.

3096
03:16:06,627 --> 03:16:08,212
Show this world...

3097
03:16:08,671 --> 03:16:13,509
...this is still a government "of the people,
for the people and by the people. "

3098
03:16:16,137 --> 03:16:18,097
Nothing as long as you live...

3099
03:16:18,180 --> 03:16:20,224
...will ever be more important.

3100
03:16:23,394 --> 03:16:24,770
It's up to you.

3101
03:16:47,960 --> 03:16:50,087
Has the jury reached a verdict?

3102
03:16:50,671 --> 03:16:51,922
We have, Your Honor.

3103
03:16:52,006 --> 03:16:54,383
Please hand the verdict to the clerk.

3104
03:17:04,018 --> 03:17:06,395
Will the defendant please rise?

3105
03:17:10,524 --> 03:17:12,735
The clerk will now read the verdict.

3106
03:17:13,527 --> 03:17:17,365
"New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969.

3107
03:17:18,199 --> 03:17:22,995
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Clay Shaw, not guilty. "

3108
03:17:44,684 --> 03:17:46,394
We believe there was a conspiracy.

3109
03:17:46,519 --> 03:17:49,522
Whether Shaw was a part of it
is another kettle of fish.

3110
03:17:49,605 --> 03:17:51,065
There's Jim!

3111
03:17:53,609 --> 03:17:58,572
Do you agree that this is a full vindication
of the Warren Commission?

3112
03:18:00,324 --> 03:18:03,411
It only proves you cannot run
an investigation...

3113
03:18:03,703 --> 03:18:08,332
...questioning the intelligence operations
of the US government.

3114
03:18:08,416 --> 03:18:11,752
People claim you're unfit to hold office...

3115
03:18:12,086 --> 03:18:14,380
...that you've ruined
Clay Shaw's reputation.

3116
03:18:14,505 --> 03:18:15,965
Are you going to resign?

3117
03:18:16,048 --> 03:18:19,635
Hell, no! I'm going to run again,
and I'm going to win!

3118
03:18:20,136 --> 03:18:22,013
Who will you persecute next?

3119
03:18:22,138 --> 03:18:25,224
If it takes me 30 years to nail every one
of the assassins...

3120
03:18:25,308 --> 03:18:27,768
...then I will continue for 30 years!

3121
03:18:28,811 --> 03:18:31,731
I owe that to Jack Kennedy
and the country.

3122
03:18:31,814 --> 03:18:34,108
There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!

3123
03:18:34,692 --> 03:18:38,195
- How does it feel to be acquitted?
- It's been exhausting.

3124
03:18:38,321 --> 03:18:39,447
What'll you do now?

3125
03:18:39,572 --> 03:18:41,282
I'm going home and cook some étouffée.

3126
03:18:41,407 --> 03:18:43,183
Were you confident about the outcome?

3127
03:18:46,078 --> 03:18:49,582
- Do you think Garrison will be back?
- I'm sure he will.
