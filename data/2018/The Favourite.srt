1403
01:39:46,179 --> 01:39:49,715
HARLEY: Marlborough's return back to England
is imminent. I wonder, Your Majesty,

1404
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:52,284
whether it is right that he
is left as head of our forces?

1405

I will rip his mole from his face.
You must stop it, Godolphin.

1406

He is a hero
who won the peace for us.

1407
01:39:58,491 --> 01:40:00,693
Indeed, but he would have
launched us into a bloody war

1408
01:40:00,695 --> 01:40:02,464
that would have ruined us,
so there's that.

Thank you, all.

GODOLPHIN:
Obviously, you have chosen

1416
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:21,650
to keep the particulars
of your dismissal from me.

1417
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:23,716
I shall leave a gap
in the conversation

1418
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:25,186

1419

I do not know of women

desire to see your nose broken.

of Lady Marlborough?

No, you may not.

1426
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,142
GODOLPHIN: A breach
in a dear friendship.

1427
01:40:51,144 --> 01:40:52,644
Surely this could be healed.

1428

that facilitates your return.

There are limits
