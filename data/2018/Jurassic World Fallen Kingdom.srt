1
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:43,099
Isla Nublar
193 miles west of Costa Rica

2
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,115
Relax.

3
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:10,677
Anything in here would
be dead by now.

4
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,058
There she is.

5
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,941
The Indominus Rex.

6
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:18,959
- Specimen collected, sent to the surface.
- Roger that.

7
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:22,397
- Air One, clear for takeoff. Begin tracking.
- Copy that.

8
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,882
- Go, go.
- Tracking on.

9
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:39,011
Land One, the asset is secure.
We got what we came for.

10
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:41,222
Coming back for you.
Close the doors.

11
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,253
Marine One, I gotta close the gate.
Get outta there.

12
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,925
Understood. We're heading out.

13
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,886
Marine One, I need to close the gate.
Confirm position.

14
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:12,198
- Can you hear me, are you out?
- Marine One?

15
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,018
Guys, what is that?

16
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:22,071
Marine One, I am
closing the gates.

17
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,548
Seriously guys, I'm kind
of exposed out here.

18
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:31,407
Marine One, confirm you're out.
Marine One!

19
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:35,080
Confirm position. Can you hear me?
Marine One, where are you?

20
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,418
I can't reach them!

21
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,067
What?!

22
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:49,848
What is going on?
I can't hear you.

23
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:10,501
Throw him the ladder!

24
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:16,813
Don't go!

25
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:44,416
We're gonna stall! Cut it now!

26
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:47,423
- Do it, John!
- We're gonna die here!

27
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,034
I said cut it!

28
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:34,372
DNA sample secure. Tell the
boss we're coming back home.

29
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:06,250
Three years after the
fall of Jurassic World,

30
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:09,289
the debate over Isla
Nublar rages on.

31
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:13,164
The island's long dormant
volcano, reclassified as active,

32
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:16,281
has shown considerable
unrest in recent months.

33
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:19,070
Theologists now predict
an extinction level event

34
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:22,578
will kill off the last living
dinosaurs on the planet.

35
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,554
Since the disaster that
shocked the world in 2015,

36
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,859
the Masrani Corporation has
paid out more than $800 million

37
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,789
in damages to settle class action
lawsuits brought by survivors.

38
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,718
Activist groups have
mobilized around the globe,

39
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,835
in what has become the flashpoint
animal rights issue of our time.

40
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,343
With an eruption
expected at any moment,

41
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:45,109
the US Senate has convened
a special committee,

42
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,523
to answer a grave
moral question:

43
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:50,257
Do dinosaurs deserve
the same protections

44
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,234
given to other
endangered species,

45
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,820
or should they be left to die?

46
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:56,298
I think...

47
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:58,971
that we should allow our...

48
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,924
magnificent, glorious dinosaurs,

49
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:05,283
to be taken out by the volcano.

50
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:11,165
- Silence, please.
- As deeply sad as that would be.

51
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:14,361
We altered the course
of natural history.

52
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:16,790
This is the correction.

53
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,032
Are you suggesting
the Almighty is

54
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:21,064
taking matters in His own hands?

55
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,994
Senator, with all due
respect, God's not...

56
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,025
part of the equation. No.

57
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,431
What I mean is that, in the
last century, we amassed

58
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:31,119
a landmark technological power.

59
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:35,556
And we've consistently proven ourselves
incapable of handling that power.

60
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,486
80 years ago, who could've
predicted nuclear proliferation?

61
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,440
But then, there it was.

62
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:41,417
And now, we've got genetic power.
So...

63
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:44,503
How long is it gonna take for
that to spread around the globe

64
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,182
and, what's gonna
be done with it?

65
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,909
It ain't gonna stop with the
de-extinction of the dinosaurs.

66
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:53,800
I'm not sure I know what
you're talking about.

67
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,557
I'm talking about...

68
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,612
man-made, cataclysmic,

69
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:00,440
change.

70
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,658
What kind of change?

71
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:04,993
Change is like death.

72
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:09,743
You don't know what it looks like
until you're standing at the gates.

73
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:33,708
As a matter of fact, I do have the
dinosaurs' best interests in mind.

74
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,295
- I'm a paleo-veterinarian.
- Is that a real thing?

75
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,990
- That's a real thing.
- You've seen one?

76
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:39,841
No! I hadn't seen one with my own eyes.
you know not

77
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:43,139
everyone can afford to spend
their life savings... Claire?

78
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,116
Hello, hello, um...

79
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:52,678
Congresswoman Delgado. I'm Claire,
the lead organizer in here.

80
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,974
Of course, but if I can just
get a moment of your time?

81
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,107
Great. Thank you.

82
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,381
So, our mission here at the
Dinosaur Protection Group is

83
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:05,029
to secure pivotal
funding for a...

84
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:07,061
That was like 40 seconds.
You're getting better.

85
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,951
You gotta stop letting
your mom shop for you.

86
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:11,445
You don't need to insult me
everytime someone pisses you off.

87
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:14,275
Dude. I'm a doctor.
Not a telemarketer.

88
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,252
What is your job again?
You plug in cords, right?

89
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,025
It's actually more
important than it sounds.

90
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,432
Can I ask you a question?

91
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,033
Do you have kids?

92
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,877
Okay. So your kids.

93
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:27,400
An entire generation has
grown up in a world

94
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:30,049
where dinosaurs are
living and breathing.

95
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,979
But soon you're gonna have
to watch them go extinct.

96
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,307
Or not.

97
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,893
If people like you
make a difference.

98
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,157
Great.

99
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,047
Yes!

100
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:49,344
- Claire, it's on.
- Hey, hey. Turn it up.

101
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:53,719
...take preventative action to protect
the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.

102
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:55,578
After thorough deliberations,

103
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:59,267
the committee has resolved not to
recommend any legislative action

104
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:03,159
regarding the de-extinct
creatures on Isla Nublar.

105
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:05,581
This is an act of God, and

106
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,612
while of course, we feel great
sympathy for these animals,

107
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,854
we cannot condone
government involvement,

108
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,354
on what amounts to a
privately-owned venture.

109
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:21,032
They're all gonna die
and no one cares.

110
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,571
We do.

111
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:31,177
Give me one second.
Let's get back to work.

112
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,403
Okay everyone. Come on.

113
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:39,469
- Hello?
- May I speak with Ms. Dearing?

114
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,524
- Yes, this is Claire Dearing.
- Good morning.

115
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:45,415
I'm calling for Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's
estate. Would you mind holding for a second?

116
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,329
Yes, of course. I'll hold.

117
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:57,121
Lockwood Estate
California

118
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:17,404
Ms. Dearing, you're early.

119
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,966
- Would you like to step in?
- Thank you.

120
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,427
I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.

121
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:48,745
John Alfred Hammond.

122
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,401
The father of Jurassic Park.

123
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,901
But of course, you know that.

124
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:54,721
Hello, Claire, I'm, I'm Eli.
Mills.

125
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:58,104
I work for Ben Lockwood. We
actually met once, 7-8 years ago,

126
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,331
- and you don't remember...
- Of course, I remember.

127
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:02,721
- Haven't you run his foundations since...
- Since college. Yeah.

128
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:03,916
- You remember?
- Yes!

129
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,807
Wow, cool. He wanted
someone young, and,

130
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,323
idealistic to expand his fortune.

131
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,510
And I used to be both.

132
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,033
Follow me.

133
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,487
Let me give you a
bit of history.

134
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,995
This is where it all began.

135
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:22,291
Before the islands, Sorna,
Jurassic Park, all of it.

136
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:25,768
Hammond and Lockwood built
custom lab in a sub-basement

137
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,115
extracted the first
DNA from amber,

138
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,936
right beneath our feet.

139
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:34,029
My goodness! What they
did here was a miracle.

140
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,762
- I still believe that.
- So do I, Claire.

141
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,216
So do I, and I still believe

142
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,842
it matters, what happens
to those animals.

143
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:47,195
There is something Mr. Lockwood would
very much like you to do, Claire.

144
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,782
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

145
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,852
We have, a piece of land.

146
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,243
A sanctuary. Protected
by natural barriers,

147
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:00,993
fully self-sustaining. A new home
where the dinosaurs will be secure...

148
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,446
- And free.
- You're gonna get them out?

149
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:06,587
- You're gonna save them?
- No, Ms. Dearing.

150
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,665
I'm going to save us.

151
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,837
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

152
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,907
- Lovely to see you again.
- And you, Mr. Lockwood.

153
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,719
This was all John
Hammond's dream.

154
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,532
To let these creatures
live in peace.

155
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:26,235
So, we have created sanctuary.

156
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,181
No fences, no
cages, no tourists.

157
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:32,595
Just as Mother Nature intended.

158
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:34,939
John said it best.

159
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:38,634
"These creatures don't
need our protection."

160
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,431
"They need our absence."

161
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,100
When we were young,

162
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:48,483
we both shared this
passion, John and I.

163
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,451
What fools we were.

164
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:56,005
Trying to run before
we'd learn to walk.

165
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:58,841
As all young men do, I suppose.

166
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:02,732
But, we learned.

167
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,388
Unfortunately in the
end, it drove us apart.

168
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,466
Life, teaches us some
very hard lessons...

169
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:14,130
Doesn't it, Claire?

170
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,020
Yes.

171
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,480
Sir Benjamin.

172
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,418
Hmm?

173
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,738
My bloody medicines.

174
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,527
- Would you excuse me, Claire?
- Of course, sir.

175
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,574
Eli here willl help
you with the details.

176
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,386
We will save them.

177
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:33,433
With a gift...

178
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,902
For our children.

179
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:38,674
Thank you.

180
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:40,487
Iris?

181
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,622
Does he have children? I thought I saw...
there was a little girl.

182
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,443
Yeah, he has a grandchild.

183
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,348
His daughter died
in a car accident.

184
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:55,232
- That's awful.
- Yeah, I know. But they're very close.

185
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,755
Really close.

186
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,708
So, what do you need from me?

187
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,724
There was a tracking system
in place at the park.

188
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:05,684
- Radio frequency ID chips in each dinosaur.
- I remember.

189
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:07,864
Right, so if we could
access that system,

190
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,434
our ability to locate and capture those
animals safely, will increase ten-fold.

191
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:14,996
We need your handprint
to access the system.

192
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,589
But what I really
need, Claire...

193
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:19,925
...is you.

194
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,606
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal.

195
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,528
But it's the right thing to do. No one
knows this park as well as you do

196
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:27,543
and we need that expertise.

197
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,786
- How many can you save?
- Eleven species. For sure,

198
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:34,975
I mean, more, if we can. But
time is against us I'm afraid.

199
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,232
There is one animal,
in particular

200
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:40,857
that poses a real
challenge for us.

201
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,068
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name. But Blue,

202
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:47,216
is potentially the second most intelligent
piece of life on this planet.

203
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,716
And she's the last of her kind.

204
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:50,177
She must be preserved.

205
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,732
She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You will never capture her.

206
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:54,826
Well...

207
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,591
We thought you might know
someone who could help.

208
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,427
Maybe you can convince him.

209
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,426
Hey, Owen.

210
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:48,746
Owen!

211
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,668
Oh, boy.

212
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:58,891
Hi.

213
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:02,048
Back for more, huh?

214
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,259
Can I buy you a beer?

215
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,985
You mean bring 'em, or we
gonna like, go somewhere?

216
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:17,944
Seriously?

217
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,397
I can't believe you
think that you left me!

218
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:22,701
Replay that conversation in
your head, all right? You said,

219
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:25,084
"You wanna go live in
your van like a bum?"

220
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:28,537
"Go ahead, Owen."
And I said, "Okay!"

221
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,834
- So how is that you leaving me?
- Because I left.

222
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:33,616
- I left you.
- You left, because...

223
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:36,990
- I told you to.
- And then, I left.

224
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,599
Because you didn't wanna live in
a van on the side of the road.

225
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,677
No, no, no. Because you wouldn't
let me drive the damn van,

226
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,084
- for 5 minutes.
- I'm chivalrous. What can I do?

227
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,302
- You are so stubborn.
- Well. Look at you now.

228
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,646
- You're saving the world.
- Well, I'm trying, at least.

229
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,997
You can't just run away
from everything, Owen.

230
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:53,403
So, you're what?

231
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:55,426
Dating an accountant now?

232
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,989
An insurance actuary?

233
00:18:58,145 --> 00:18:59,973
Your skin looks nice.

234
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:04,355
- Dermatologist?
- Owen?

235
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:06,088
- Does he check you for moles?
- Stop.

236
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,112
Ventriloquist?

237
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:10,535
- This is not why we're here, okay?
- Yeah, I know why we're here.

238
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:13,387
Lockwood's little
flunkie called me.

239
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:14,637
Rescue op.

240
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,832
Save the dinosaurs from an
island that's about to explode.

241
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,505
- What could go wrong?
- I'm going.

242
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,317
- Don't!
- I don't have a choice.

243
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:24,106
- What, of course you have a choice.
- So what, I should just...

244
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:26,677
Build my own cabin, play
pool and drink beer all day

245
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:28,982
while these dinosaurs
go extinct?

246
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:31,631
Yeah. I like pool.

247
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:34,091
Blue is alive.

248
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:38,177
- Jesus, Claire.
- You raised her, Owen. You...

249
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,959
You spent years of your
life working with her.

250
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:43,443
You're just gonna let her die?

251
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,587
Well, yeah.

252
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,735
Come on. You're a
better man than...

253
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:53,595
you think you are.

254
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:57,142
You should write for
fortune cookies.

255
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,150
Forget it. I...

256
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:03,080
There's a chartered flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

257
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:06,080
You're on the manifest. I just
thought I should let you know.

258
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,301
Back up! Back off.

259
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:32,223
Take it easy. Echo.

260
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,129
Jeez. There's plenty of food.

261
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:39,543
You guys been eating sugar or something?
You're hyper today.

262
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:44,866
Okay, okay, back off.
Thank you, Blue.

263
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:56,302
Did you get that?

264
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:05,324
Relax.

265
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,167
You're more likely to die riding
a horse than in a plane.

266
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:11,237
No, I would not because I wouldn't
get on a horse. My chances are zero.

267
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:13,519
- Planes are the safest way to travel.
- You call this a plane?

268
00:21:13,544 --> 00:21:15,942
My cousin had a drone
bigger than this.

269
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,106
Owen!

270
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:27,208
Franklin, later!
Get in the plane.

271
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,529
Didn't think you were
gonna ever show up.

272
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:32,623
- This is Zia Rodriguez.
- Zia.

273
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:34,601
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

274
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,671
- Good.
- Franklin Webb.

275
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,601
Systems analyst.

276
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:41,273
Nervous flyer?

277
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:44,038
Would you ride a thousand pound
horse with big wheels on the sides?

278
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:47,124
I rode a motorcycle through the
jungle with a pack of raptors.

279
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,858
We're not compatible.

280
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,150
Maisie!

281
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,050
Maisie.

282
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,847
Maisie!

283
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:19,730
Come out.

284
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,751
You silly sausage!

285
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,125
You'll be the death of me.

286
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,476
You know one day, my
heart might really stop.

287
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,158
Then what would you do?

288
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,134
- Go live in the forest with the lions?
- There are no lions in the forest.

289
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:45,674
Your grandfather's
been asking for you.

290
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,549
Really?

291
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:49,025
So you go see your grandfather and
you go straight to your bath.

292
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:50,986
- I don't want a bath.
- What?!

293
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:53,127
Queen's English, girl. Bath.

294
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:54,643
- Bath. Bath.
- Bath. Bath.

295
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:57,699
Not bath. You're
not a wild animal.

296
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,034
Stop.

297
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:06,506
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Ah, there you are.

298
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,702
Come over and sit by me.

299
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:11,544
- I've missed you.
- I went by all the way through the

300
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,694
Cretaceous, to the
Jurassic in one day.

301
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,114
My. What did you see?

302
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:18,254
Nothing but herbivores. There
was one T-Rex, though.

303
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:21,634
Casualties, of course.
Ours included.

304
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:23,247
She jumped out of her skin.

305
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,137
You have your mother's
wicked sense of humor.

306
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:31,950
Do I look like her?

307
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,395
Oh, yes.

308
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:37,903
You could be her mirror image.

309
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,567
Did my mother ever
visit the park?

310
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,036
Once.

311
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,450
A long time ago.

312
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,114
She would have saved
them too, you know.

313
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,317
She would have saved them all.

314
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:51,149
Claire.

315
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:55,985
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.

316
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,861
What kind of operation
you've got going on here?

317
00:24:57,885 --> 00:25:01,635
Mr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian
efforts very seriously.

318
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:04,533
Where's the raptor wrangler?

319
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,133
Animal behaviourist. Owen Grady.

320
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:08,758
Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.

321
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,353
And you're our,
great white hunter?

322
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:14,981
Yes, I'm the expedition's
facilitator.

323
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,825
Oh, God! It's hot!

324
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,095
It's about to get a
whole lot hotter.

325
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:50,686
Bug spray?

326
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:52,561
Bug spray?

327
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,124
The T-Rex should be
dead by now, right?

328
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:59,446
Yeah, well it's impossible
to know the max life span

329
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,710
of a clone in a completely
different environment.

330
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,866
Take a caveman that
would've lived 20 years.

331
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,967
Feed him prime meals, give him
healthcare, he's gonna live...

332
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:08,624
Five times as long.

333
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,054
So, she'd be dead by now.

334
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,155
Right?

335
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,484
Bad memories?

336
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,422
Some are good.

337
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:18,270
What was that?

338
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,930
Is it the T-Rex?

339
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,086
I have to see this.

340
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:37,203
Hey, Miss?

341
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,227
Miss! This area's not secured.

342
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:13,544
Look at that.

343
00:28:14,364 --> 00:28:17,035
Never thought I'd see
one in real life.

344
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,207
She's beautiful.

345
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,595
Shall we?

346
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,253
Okay! Let's go.

347
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:56,439
Okay, I'm good.
Viewing system...

348
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:12,277
Come on, tiger. You
know what you're doing?

349
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:19,252
After you, tiger.

350
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,275
Are we sure these biometric
chips are still transmitting?

351
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,853
Battery would be dead by now.

352
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:31,072
The dinosaur is the battery. They're
powered by body heat and movement.

353
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:32,494
Hand.

354
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:37,783
How much longer until...

355
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:41,892
I'm in.

356
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,036
There's a large concentration
on the East Dock.

357
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:49,559
That's our boat. We've already
captured a bunch of them.

358
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,551
Without the tracking system?

359
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:55,020
The big herbivores were easy to find.
Can you isolate that raptor?

360
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,153
- I need a species code.
- D-9.

361
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:02,255
There she is.

362
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:05,137
- I'm gonna need to borrow your truck.
- I'm coming with you.

363
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,161
We don't know what kind of
condition she might be in.

364
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:10,059
Miss, things could
get hairy out there.

365
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,577
These are powerful sedatives.

366
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:16,911
One too many, and she could
have respiratory failure.

367
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:20,375
Also, I'm not as soft and witless
as your comment implies.

368
00:30:21,482 --> 00:30:23,567
Let's go, Beefcake.

369
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:25,560
Oh, Owen...

370
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,333
Be careful. Okay?

371
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:34,773
If I don't make it back...

372
00:30:35,954 --> 00:30:37,484
Remember.

373
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,633
You're the one who made me come.

374
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:42,851
I'll be all right.

375
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:55,796
We're not gonna get any closer
if we're riding this thing.

376
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,359
- You should stop here.
- Pull up!

377
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,187
Move out. Look alive.
Stay alive.

378
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:05,866
- We got your back, brother.
- Yeah.

379
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:08,741
Claire, I'm gonna have
to track for a moment.

380
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,078
I'll need you to be my
eyes if she runs. Copy?

381
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,436
Copy that.

382
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:50,976
Wheatley, I'm on a fresh sign.
Wait for my signal.

383
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,924
There you are.

384
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:35,718
Hey, Girl. You miss me?

385
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,819
Easy. Hey! Hey.

386
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,272
I brought you something.

387
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:51,169
There you go.

388
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,411
That's right.

389
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:56,981
Okay.

390
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,170
You know me.

391
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,599
Eyes on me.

392
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,676
You know me.

393
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,293
That's right.

394
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,192
That's right.

395
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:23,449
Hold your....

396
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,894
I told you to wait
for my signal!

397
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:33,792
Back your men off, right now.

398
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,462
No, don't shoot her!

399
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:58,814
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!

400
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:09,270
Owen! What are you doing?

401
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:10,558
Owen.

402
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,665
You shoot me...

403
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,407
And that animal dies.

404
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:25,493
I think we have the drop
on you, sweetheart.

405
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:27,009
She's losing blood.

406
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,700
And if I don't treat her...

407
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:31,551
She'll never make
it back to camp.

408
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:41,953
How ' bout this then...

409
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:44,609
If that animal
dies, I shoot you.

410
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,827
You're gonna take care of her.

411
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:48,772
Let's move out!

412
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:05,090
Get to the car, let's go!
Let's get out of here.

413
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:11,198
No, no!

414
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,915
Wait, are they protecting us?
What's going on?

415
00:35:20,478 --> 00:35:21,954
I don't think so.

416
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:25,704
Why am I here?

417
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:32,805
Hey, Mills. We gathered the dinos.
Mission accomplished.

418
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:37,623
And just in the nick of time.

419
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:40,766
Wheatley what the hell is going on there?
We're a day behind schedule already.

420
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,522
I want that money in the bank by
the time I get back, alright?

421
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:46,397
Okay, listen to me.
No more delays, okay?

422
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:49,061
If we don't get... not
now, Maisie, thank you.

423
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:52,444
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs...
- I said not now!

424
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:58,862
I'm sorry, honey. This
is an important call.

425
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,588
If you would go up to the library, I'll
meet you up there in a few minutes.

426
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,626
- Okay.
- Okay?

427
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:04,735
I'll tell you all about it.
I promise.

428
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:05,922
Okay.

429
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:08,601
Wheatley?

430
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,054
You get, those
animals, here, now.

431
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,125
I want that bonus.
We got the blue one.

432
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:17,633
- Bring her to me first.
 - All right.

433
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:56,174
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Hello?

434
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,205
Hello? Is anybody there?

435
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:00,346
Can anybody copy?

436
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:04,220
I'm trying everything.
It's jammed.

437
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:07,783
"It's a tough job, son. Build your
people skills." Yeah, thanks, Dad.

438
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,641
That's it.

439
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:14,790
Proximity alert.

440
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:17,399
Something's coming.

441
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:19,258
Where does that tunnel lead?

442
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:22,195
Well, it connects to
the rest of the...

443
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:24,291
park.

444
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:29,674
It's the T-Rex. It's the T-Rex.

445
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,260
Claire, it's the T-Rex.
It's the T-Rex.

446
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:33,245
Will you stop? It's
not the T-Rex.

447
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:37,253
- Probably.
- Probably?

448
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:41,831
Lava! Lava!

449
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:42,941
Lava...

450
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:45,252
Deep breaths, Franklin...

451
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:03,966
- See? Not a T-Rex!
- This is bigger!

452
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:18,279
Claire, what do we do?
What do we do?

453
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,404
It's stuck! Chair!

454
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,931
Come on! Let's go.

455
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:44,141
Come on, Franklin!

456
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,718
We made it! Yeah!

457
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:09,084
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Claire!

458
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,919
Yes, let's go!

459
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:28,807
Claire.

460
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,237
Holy...

461
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,070
Run!

462
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,820
Run!

463
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:50,726
Run!

464
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:04,673
Go! Go.

465
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:09,781
Get in!

466
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:30,528
Owen!

467
00:44:22,345 --> 00:44:25,015
We didn't die. We just
fell from a cliff.

468
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,868
We're alive! We're alive.

469
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:30,204
Franklin, move!

470
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:32,935
No, no, no!

471
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,841
Claire, we're gonna
sink, water's leaking!

472
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,594
We need to get out!

473
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:45,836
Franklin, watch out!

474
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:51,179
I wanna go home!

475
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:56,147
Owen. Owen!

476
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:57,429
Owen?

477
00:45:00,015 --> 00:45:02,218
Move. Move!

478
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:07,952
No, no, no...

479
00:45:12,554 --> 00:45:14,046
Owen!

480
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,156
Where is he going?

481
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,843
Okay, don't panic. Don't panic.

482
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,866
- We're not gonna make it, Claire.
- We are. We are.

483
00:45:24,897 --> 00:45:26,905
Take a deep breath.

484
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:39,352
- Where's Zia?
- It was a double-cross. They took her.

485
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:42,585
She must be with Blue. Hey,
can you still track 'em?

486
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:46,460
Not anymore.

487
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:48,616
It was a lie.

488
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:52,351
It was a lie. Bastards!
It was all a lie!

489
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:08,435
Not all of it.

490
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:20,700
Move! Move!

491
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:23,505
Anything of value, I want out of here.
Let's go.

492
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:25,263
What are you doing?

493
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:28,935
Well just put it up and we'll tow it on.
Let's go!

494
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:51,982
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

495
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:56,232
Wait up. Wait up. Stop that truck.
Stop it.

496
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:02,776
Hey, sweetheart. Hey, girl.
Hey, girl.

497
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:15,149
You're gonna feel that
when you wake up.

498
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,016
Hey, put your weapon down!

499
00:48:22,686 --> 00:48:25,358
- They have Zia. They're loading out.
- They already have the dinosaurs.

500
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:27,006
Why do they need us?

501
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:30,162
They needed the tracking
system to capture Blue.

502
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,358
There she is. She
don't look good.

503
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:38,600
We need to get on that boat.

504
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:42,000
- The rock's good. We're safe on the rock.
- Just get up, Franklin.

505
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:44,789
All right, boat's good.
I'm on it.

506
00:48:47,622 --> 00:48:50,442
Get on the boat! Get
on the boat now!

507
00:48:58,193 --> 00:49:00,161
Get to that truck!

508
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:20,665
- Franklin!
- Hey, get that truck going.

509
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:22,820
- Are you okay?
- Am I dead?

510
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:24,531
Not yet, kid.

511
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,289
Come on! Give me your hand.

512
00:49:53,252 --> 00:49:54,814
Hold on!

513
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:02,454
Mr. Mills? Your
visitor's waiting.

514
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:08,544
Mr. Eversoll.

515
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:11,371
It's a pleasure to meet you in person
after all this time. How are you?

516
00:52:11,387 --> 00:52:13,207
Excuse me, where
are the dinosaurs?

517
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:15,660
The dinosaurs... are en route.

518
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:18,246
Oh, so am I supposed
to sell these ones?

519
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:20,715
You don't need to worry, okay?
They will be here soon.

520
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:23,027
I don't really work
with amateurs,

521
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:25,331
so I'm gonna contact my
buyers and call this off.

522
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:28,419
They will be here tomorrow and your
buyers won't be disappointed. Trust me.

523
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:31,856
Whatever their interest. Agricultural,
industrial, sport-hunting.

524
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:34,762
We will have something to suit them.
Eleven species.

525
00:52:34,787 --> 00:52:37,928
Each with unique,
bio-pharmaceutical properties.

526
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:40,482
I estimate $4 million
per species.

527
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:44,514
$4 million is a slow
Tuesday where I'm from.

528
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:46,343
You're wasting my time.

529
00:52:46,368 --> 00:52:49,686
You ready to make $100
million on a Tuesday? Huh?

530
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:53,145
All of this is in the past.

531
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:56,793
Now, I wanna talk to
you about the future.

532
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,926
I'll give you ten minutes.

533
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:04,668
The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

534
00:53:04,693 --> 00:53:06,973
is to finance our
future operations here.

535
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,262
It's, uh... seed money.

536
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:12,426
Call it an overture to
something much more ambitious.

537
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,848
Yeah. And more
lucrative, I guess.

538
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:17,755
Right. We've reactivated
the old facilities,

539
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:21,701
updated the technology and imported the
best geneticists from around the world.

540
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,216
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

541
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:27,294
Genetic power is an
uncharted frontier.

542
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:30,919
The potential for growth is
more than you can fathom.

543
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:34,786
This way, please.

544
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:38,200
If the entire run of our sorry
history has taught us one

545
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,638
irrevocable lesson,

546
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:42,897
it's that man is
inevitably drawn to war.

547
00:53:42,921 --> 00:53:46,991
And is willing to use any
means necessary to win it.

548
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:48,323
You're gonna weaponize them?

549
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:50,733
We've been using animals
in combat for centuries.

550
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,694
Horses, elephants.

551
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:56,084
The Soviets used disease-bearing rats
against the Germans in Stalingrad.

552
00:53:56,101 --> 00:53:57,717
- Yes, yes.
- Our geneticists,

553
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:01,788
have created a direct descendant,
of Henry Wu's masterpiece.

554
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,889
The animal that took
down Jurassic World.

555
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,427
Indominus Rex.

556
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,692
Her DNA, retrieved
from the island,

557
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:11,591
way before its destruction,
forms the architecture

558
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,403
of a completely new creature.

559
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:18,114
Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.

560
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:22,605
And thanks to Owen Grady's research,
it follows human command.

561
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:26,706
We call it, the Indoraptor.

562
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:36,965
Grandpa? Grandpa?

563
00:54:55,915 --> 00:54:58,368
- Grandpa.
- Maisie.

564
00:54:58,439 --> 00:54:59,696
What are you doing up?

565
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,337
There was a man here today, with Mr.
Mills.

566
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:05,993
It was probably just some business
about the Century, is all.

567
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:07,400
I heard them talking.

568
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:10,759
They're going to sell the dinosaurs.
They're bringing them here.

569
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:12,782
I'm sure you misunderstood.

570
00:55:12,807 --> 00:55:14,744
- I know what I heard, Grandpa.
- Maisie...

571
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:17,275
it's way past your bedtime.

572
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,135
Let's talk about
this in the morning.

573
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:20,546
- But...
- Maisie.

574
00:55:20,648 --> 00:55:23,780
I'll find out tomorrow.
Go to bed.

575
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:28,577
- Good night.
- Good night, my heart.

576
00:55:58,255 --> 00:55:59,505
Jesus!

577
00:56:07,096 --> 00:56:09,666
Hold on. Just a little longer.

578
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:12,213
Oh, my God, you guys are alive!

579
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,087
Look what they've done to her.

580
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:20,471
- Who are these assholes?
- Animal traffickers.

581
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,768
Look how they're treating them. They're
not gonna take them to a sanctuary,

582
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:24,361
- they're gonna sell them.
- Not Blue.

583
00:56:24,392 --> 00:56:26,689
- They need her for something else.
- Like what?

584
00:56:26,736 --> 00:56:28,354
I don't know, but she's...

585
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:32,152
She's hemorrhaging and I don't have
instruments to keep her alive.

586
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:37,855
Claire, come here.
Put your hand here.

587
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,456
Steady pressure.

588
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:40,987
Hey, hey.

589
00:56:43,577 --> 00:56:46,537
I can't take the bullet out without
a transfusion from another animal.

590
00:56:46,562 --> 00:56:48,545
Which one of you guys
know how to find a vein?

591
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:50,616
I did a blood drive
with Red Cross.

592
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,749
Great! Okay.

593
00:56:53,022 --> 00:56:54,968
Franklin, you take
over for Claire.

594
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:58,108
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Franklin! Now!

595
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,851
Steady pressure.

596
00:57:02,992 --> 00:57:04,897
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

597
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:07,405
Is it in my mouth? Did
it get in my mouth?

598
00:57:07,702 --> 00:57:09,545
- Sure?
- You're good.

599
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:11,475
All of the animals
should be sedated.

600
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,476
Look for any type of () their blood
type should be close enough.

601
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,890
Look for carnivores, with two or
three fingers. No more than three.

602
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,749
I think there is one on board.

603
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:38,298
You've got to be kidding me.

604
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,953
She's tranqed.

605
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:04,477
Okay, okay. I got it, come on.

606
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,547
Okay.

607
00:58:12,374 --> 00:58:14,311
Are you okay?

608
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,944
I'm okay!

609
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:17,389
Come on.

610
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:24,783
- You're gonna have to do it.
- I can't

611
00:58:24,808 --> 00:58:27,899
The skin is too thick, I'd have to use
both hands to put pressure on the vein.

612
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:30,485
- You gotta do it.
- I, I can't, I can't reach...

613
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,737
You're gonna have
to climb up there.

614
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:34,737
Oh, I'm not...

615
00:58:34,808 --> 00:58:36,136
I'm not gonna climb up there.

616
00:58:36,175 --> 00:58:38,206
You'll be okay. It's
like riding a bull.

617
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:41,434
Riding a bull? I didn't grow up in
a rodeo or wherever you came from.

618
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:44,473
She's asleep now. I can't say that she's
gonna be asleep a minute from now.

619
00:58:44,498 --> 00:58:46,458
- So, get up.
- Okay, fine.

620
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:49,590
Oh my God, she stinks. Jesus!

621
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,003
Good job.

622
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:06,722
You're making this
look totally normal.

623
00:59:08,886 --> 00:59:12,261
You're gonna have to jam it in here.
It's really thick skin.

624
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:13,604
Ready?

625
00:59:14,112 --> 00:59:16,323
One, two...

626
00:59:18,854 --> 00:59:20,205
Owen!

627
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:31,013
It's working.

628
00:59:34,803 --> 00:59:36,029
Who left this open?

629
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:37,188
I got it.

630
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,440
The bars!

631
00:59:57,518 --> 01:00:00,275
I can get through here. Come on.

632
01:00:12,806 --> 01:00:14,524
Jump! Owen!

633
01:00:32,865 --> 01:00:34,489
Did you see that?

634
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:38,584
Please tell me you
have the blood.

635
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,308
This is Delta. She is one of
the four little therapods.

636
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,284
One of the survivors
from the second group.

637
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:08,425
Now, watch this.

638
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,527
If I show any sign of
weakness, whatsoever...

639
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:18,528
You see that?

640
01:02:18,553 --> 01:02:22,888
Day 176. Blue is showing
unprecedented levels of compliance.

641
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:25,342
Here I am with Blue.

642
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,670
She's a therapod
from a new group.

643
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:32,084
If I show signs of weakness...

644
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:45,884
Hey...

645
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:48,774
I'm okay.

646
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:50,999
She...

647
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:53,103
She's pretty extraordinary.

648
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:04,918
Blue...

649
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:09,145
displaying levels of
interest, concern,

650
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:12,700
hyperintelligence,
cognitive bonding...

651
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,223
See that?

652
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:18,755
Tilting her head, she's
playing for us...

653
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:21,559
Increased eye movement,
she's curious.

654
01:03:21,584 --> 01:03:23,660
She's showing empathy.

655
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:27,919
Okay, I'm gonna make an incision
on her leg to remove the bullet.

656
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:34,334
It's a lot of muscle tissue.

657
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:09,136
She's gonna be okay.

658
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,084
Blue is the key.

659
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:20,287
You have Blue...

660
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,701
You'll get these raptors
to do anything.

661
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:23,960
You're sure she'll live?

662
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:25,363
If it dies, we have
blood samples.

663
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:29,067
No, that's not good enough. The
raptor is a behavioural specimen.

664
01:04:29,091 --> 01:04:32,317
- We need her in good health.
- I didn't shoot the damn thing.

665
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,755
What do you want me to do, huh?

666
01:04:35,013 --> 01:04:39,614
You don't have the faintest
comprehension of what I'm doing here.

667
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:43,928
Do you understand the complexity of
creating an entirely new lifeform?

668
01:04:43,953 --> 01:04:47,562
No, but I understand the
complexity of paying for it. Okay?

669
01:04:47,594 --> 01:04:51,304
All your money will have been wasted if
I don't get Blue here in good health.

670
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,945
To get the next iteration
under control,

671
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,515
it needs to form a familial bond
with a closely related genetic link.

672
01:04:57,523 --> 01:05:00,609
- English, Henry.
- It needs a mother!

673
01:05:02,177 --> 01:05:06,333
Blue's DNA will be part of the
next Indoraptor's make up.

674
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:09,233
So it will be genetically coded
to recognize her authority

675
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,756
and assume her traits.

676
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:14,225
Empathy. Obedience. Everything the
prototype you have now is missing.

677
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:18,328
- Okay, so how long is this gonna take?
- It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.

678
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,171
- It's a marathon.
- Marathon sounds expensive.

679
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,296
Besides, time is running out
and so is my patience, Henry.

680
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,492
You have to understand. This
is all uncharted territory.

681
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:31,546
A wolf, genetically, is barely
distinguishable from a bulldog.

682
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,429
But within that gray area....

683
01:05:35,663 --> 01:05:37,337
is heart.

684
01:05:37,514 --> 01:05:41,045
Spare me the poetry, Henry. Can you do it?
Can you do it?

685
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:42,951
Yes, I can do it.

686
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,724
Well then, do it!

687
01:05:44,764 --> 01:05:46,107
Thank you.

688
01:05:46,498 --> 01:05:48,771
God, you brainy asshole.

689
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,145
Hey, hey! Maisie!

690
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:09,301
What is that? What is it?

691
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:19,366
Keep her in there, and
keep the door locked.

692
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:22,240
- You want to keep her locked in?
- That's exactly what I want.

693
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:24,662
Sir Benjamin needs
to see her now.

694
01:06:27,827 --> 01:06:29,959
I believe it's important.

695
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:10,085
We're here.

696
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:11,156
Where?

697
01:07:15,836 --> 01:07:17,258
She got a heartbeat?

698
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,961
Yeah. Do you?

699
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,132
We need blood samples.

700
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:21,961
I'm not here to help you
reset the food chain,

701
01:07:21,986 --> 01:07:25,110
so take your own damn samples.

702
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,884
What a nasty woman.

703
01:07:38,716 --> 01:07:40,263
Hey!

704
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:42,934
- What the hell is going on?
- I was...

705
01:07:43,779 --> 01:07:45,973
I needed an extra pair of hands.
He volunteered.

706
01:07:45,998 --> 01:07:47,544
- You deck crew?
- Aye-aye.

707
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:49,239
We're logging out. Follow me.

708
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:51,201
Does that mean we're leaving the ship?
Right now?

709
01:07:51,217 --> 01:07:54,232
That means what that means.
Now get moving. Come on, follow me!

710
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:57,801
- Shit!
- Oh, no.

711
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,778
He's not gonna make it.

712
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:02,809
- We have to help him.
- Stay here. I'll get him.

713
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,520
There's no time. Let's go.

714
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:23,045
Roll out!

715
01:08:24,474 --> 01:08:26,388
Where are they taking them?

716
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:28,162
We're about to find out.

717
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,296
Yes!

718
01:08:55,442 --> 01:08:57,009
Lockwood's Estate?

719
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,627
He must have one big-ass garage.

720
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:50,315
Did you really think you
could get away with it?

721
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:53,009
In my own house.

722
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,760
You entrusted me.

723
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:58,478
To guide your fortune
into the future.

724
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,423
- I have done that.
- Damn you!

725
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,450
Pick up that phone.

726
01:10:06,622 --> 01:10:09,879
I want you to call the police.

727
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:13,872
It'll be easier if the
story comes from you.

728
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,684
As you say, sir.

729
01:10:24,188 --> 01:10:26,016
You know, I've been thinking...

730
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:28,336
John Hammond was right.

731
01:10:28,868 --> 01:10:32,203
It was an unholy
thing that you did.

732
01:10:35,626 --> 01:10:39,031
I'm not the only guilty
one here, am I, sir?

733
01:10:57,672 --> 01:10:58,727
Hey.

734
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:04,140
We hit that town and we call
the cavalry to shut this down.

735
01:11:09,046 --> 01:11:12,523
Hello. You should've
stayed on the island.

736
01:11:12,758 --> 01:11:14,585
Better odds.

737
01:11:25,332 --> 01:11:26,869
Hi, Claire.

738
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,080
I just wanted to
come and apologize.

739
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:33,049
I didn't want to bring
you into any of this,

740
01:11:33,074 --> 01:11:36,066
but it was the only way
that we can get the raptor.

741
01:11:36,082 --> 01:11:37,730
And we needed it.

742
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,128
Come on.

743
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:42,011
So, what?

744
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:43,582
This is it?

745
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:48,917
I mean, you're a smart guy who started a
foundation to cure cancer. But instead, you...

746
01:11:49,549 --> 01:11:50,549
What?

747
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:54,259
- Sell endangered species?
- I saved these animals.

748
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,509
You betrayed a dying
man for money.

749
01:11:56,541 --> 01:12:00,478
Claire, I admire your idealism, but
we both exploited these animals.

750
01:12:00,494 --> 01:12:02,439
At least, I have the
integrity to admit it.

751
01:12:02,463 --> 01:12:07,400
- I never, ever did anything remotely illegal.
- You authorized the creation of the Indominus Rex.

752
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:12,008
You exploited a living
thing, in a cage, for money.

753
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:14,923
How is that different?
Huh? And you.

754
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:17,430
The man who proved raptors
can follow orders.

755
01:12:17,469 --> 01:12:20,570
You never thought about the
applications of your research, Owen?

756
01:12:20,688 --> 01:12:23,570
How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?

757
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:27,481
You two...

758
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,746
You're the parents
of the new world.

759
01:12:33,278 --> 01:12:35,114
Hey! Let him go.

760
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,950
- Owen?
- I think I'll break it.

761
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:38,559
Let him go.

762
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:43,663
Claire, it's....

763
01:12:52,354 --> 01:12:53,974
Say the word, we
got them, Mills.

764
01:12:54,011 --> 01:12:59,042
Well, as far as everybody else is
concerned, they burned up on the island.

765
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:18,479
Looks like a full house.

766
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,385
Roger that.

767
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,980
- Good evening.
- Good evening, good evening.

768
01:13:49,005 --> 01:13:51,293
Welcome. Welcome.

769
01:13:52,692 --> 01:13:56,357
This guy, he's Ricky Rathrow.
Darius Pharmaceuticals.

770
01:13:56,388 --> 01:13:57,325
Right.

771
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,614
And the guy in the beard? He's
a proxy for Gregor Aldorich.

772
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:02,803
Slovenian arms dealer.

773
01:14:37,248 --> 01:14:40,591
Well, he only wants carnivores.
Two of them.

774
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:43,685
Looks like Lockwood's gonna
have a very good night.

775
01:14:43,724 --> 01:14:45,521
Will he be joining us?

776
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:48,060
That's very unlikely.

777
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:01,663
Grandpa?

778
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:10,113
Grandpa?

779
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:13,112
Grandpa, wake up.

780
01:15:14,659 --> 01:15:15,956
Grandpa.

781
01:15:17,315 --> 01:15:20,182
Grandpa, wake up. Wake up!

782
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,275
Iris!

783
01:15:35,548 --> 01:15:36,829
Iris!

784
01:15:39,749 --> 01:15:40,991
It's over.

785
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:46,553
What a tragedy.

786
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:52,537
I suppose now he's gone,

787
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:55,608
- you'll be looking for another situation.
- No.

788
01:15:56,866 --> 01:15:59,030
Maisie needs me.

789
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:03,076
I am her guardian now.

790
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:06,764
What she needs is no
longer your concern.

791
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:10,350
You don't understand
her the way I do.

792
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:13,733
I understand her value.

793
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,469
But I raised her.

794
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:18,445
I raised...

795
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:19,898
both of them.

796
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:26,618
- Please, Mr. Mills.
- Goodbye, Iris.

797
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:10,639
Do you remember the first
time you saw a dinosaur?

798
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:16,959
First time you see them,
it's like, a miracle.

799
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:19,990
You read about them in books.
You see the bones in museums.

800
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,599
But you don't really believe it.

801
01:17:22,928 --> 01:17:24,607
Kind of like myths.

802
01:17:25,428 --> 01:17:27,209
And then you see...

803
01:17:28,129 --> 01:17:30,769
the first one alive.

804
01:17:35,115 --> 01:17:37,044
This is not your fault.

805
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:40,146
- But it is.
- No.

806
01:17:41,952 --> 01:17:44,155
This one's on me.

807
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:48,162
I showed them the way.

808
01:17:49,593 --> 01:17:51,350
Now, listen.

809
01:17:51,374 --> 01:17:54,983
You and I are gonna have plenty
of time to talk about this later.

810
01:17:54,999 --> 01:17:57,725
- If there is a later.
- Yes, there is.

811
01:17:59,944 --> 01:18:02,295
I got a cabin to finish.

812
01:18:10,456 --> 01:18:12,135
What is that?

813
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:19,190
Well, look who just woke up.

814
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,374
We're getting out of here.

815
01:18:32,515 --> 01:18:36,756
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen...

816
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:40,327
To this extraordinary evening.

817
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:44,881
Let's dive right in,
with lot number 1.

818
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,717
The ankylosaurus.

819
01:18:49,085 --> 01:18:51,960
This is a herbivorous quadruped.

820
01:18:52,171 --> 01:18:54,124
Late Cretaceous.

821
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:58,061
This is one of the largest
armored dinosaurs.

822
01:18:58,295 --> 01:19:03,146
Known by paleontologists
as a "living tank".

823
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:11,541
- What are you doing?
- Save it.

824
01:19:11,674 --> 01:19:14,080
- Are you sure about this?
- Nope.

825
01:19:16,325 --> 01:19:19,239
I have $4 million dollars.
Anyone with 5?

826
01:19:19,357 --> 01:19:22,880
$5 million. $5 million.
Do I hear 6?

827
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:26,912
$6 million. Thank you. Any increase on six?
Seven. $7 million.

828
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:31,436
$8 million. $9 million on the phones.
Do I hear $10 million?

829
01:19:32,577 --> 01:19:35,537
$10 million. Once, twice...

830
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:41,092
Sold! To the gentleman from Indonesia.
Congratulations.

831
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:48,553
Lot number 2, ladies
and gentlemen.

832
01:19:49,311 --> 01:19:52,264
Juvenile Allosaurus.

833
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:57,912
A fierce and
aggressive predator.

834
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,311
Sold!

835
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:04,092
Sold!

836
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,317
Sold!

837
01:20:08,713 --> 01:20:12,081
Wonderful. Wonderful.

838
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:42,097
Okay...

839
01:20:42,551 --> 01:20:45,691
Hey, hey you! Look
at me, look at me!

840
01:20:46,519 --> 01:20:47,722
Hey!

841
01:20:49,574 --> 01:20:50,714
Okay.

842
01:21:09,262 --> 01:21:11,082
You're welcome.

843
01:21:19,302 --> 01:21:22,966
Hey! Wait. Please, please, wait.

844
01:21:27,486 --> 01:21:29,977
That's Lockwood's granddaughter.

845
01:21:30,884 --> 01:21:32,806
Hey. Hey, kid.

846
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:35,267
You wanna come
down out of there?

847
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,406
Do you remember me?

848
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:47,477
My name is Claire. What's yours?

849
01:21:48,118 --> 01:21:49,274
Maisie.

850
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:52,326
- Maisie Lockwood.
- Maisie.

851
01:21:52,358 --> 01:21:55,264
This is my friend, Owen.

852
01:21:56,288 --> 01:22:00,241
I saw you, with the velociraptors.
And Blue.

853
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,709
Oh, yeah?

854
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:07,322
You like dinosaurs?

855
01:22:08,861 --> 01:22:11,806
So do I. Tell you what, you
come on down from there,

856
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:14,274
I'll tell you everything you
need to know about Blue.

857
01:22:14,798 --> 01:22:16,485
That sound all right?

858
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,235
Alright. Yeah. Come on down.

859
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:30,501
Sweetie...

860
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:32,744
We need some help finding
your grandfather.

861
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:35,212
Can you take us to him?

862
01:22:35,236 --> 01:22:36,329
No.

863
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:39,118
You made it down here
all by yourself, huh.

864
01:22:39,142 --> 01:22:42,712
Brave kid. Looks like
you could use a friend.

865
01:22:43,415 --> 01:22:45,336
He's gone!

866
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,335
So listen, I'll tell you what.

867
01:22:51,352 --> 01:22:55,406
We're just about to go and find our
friends and then get the heck outta here.

868
01:22:55,468 --> 01:22:57,343
You wanna come with us?

869
01:22:57,366 --> 01:22:59,546
We could use a friend, too.

870
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:15,542
Sold!

871
01:23:15,612 --> 01:23:18,580
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, that we are

872
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:21,549
halfway through the evening...

873
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:25,946
We'd like to offer a
special treat to our

874
01:23:26,142 --> 01:23:29,110
discriminating buyers.

875
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,985
This evening, we will preview,

876
01:23:32,134 --> 01:23:35,586
a new asset that we've
been developing.

877
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,232
A creature of the future,

878
01:23:38,257 --> 01:23:40,818
made from pieces of the past.

879
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:45,372
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be warned.

880
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:49,622
This is the perfect blend of the
two most dangerous creatures...

881
01:23:49,647 --> 01:23:52,267
that have ever walked the earth.

882
01:23:52,655 --> 01:23:54,405
We call it...

883
01:23:54,647 --> 01:23:57,358
The Indoraptor.

884
01:24:18,591 --> 01:24:21,427
The perfect weapon
for the modern age.

885
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,578
Built for combat.

886
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:27,679
With tactical responses more
acute than any human soldier.

887
01:24:27,704 --> 01:24:29,102
What is that thing?

888
01:24:45,942 --> 01:24:47,957
They made it.

889
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,926
Mr. Mills, and the other man.

890
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,630
What man?

891
01:24:52,513 --> 01:24:53,271
Him.

892
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:56,005
Designed by Mr. Henry Wu...

893
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:59,763
Its' intelligence quotient
comparable to the velociraptor.

894
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:03,334
Bio-specs include
hyper sense of smell,

895
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:07,605
trained to respond to a pulse
coded, laser-targeting system.

896
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:12,874
Enabling it to isolate and track
prey in complex environments.

897
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:14,343
Voila!

898
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:24,132
Now first, your laser
sets the target.

899
01:25:26,397 --> 01:25:31,706
Once locked on, the acoustic
signal triggers the attack.

900
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:40,659
This animal is relentless.

901
01:25:40,722 --> 01:25:44,159
Now, modifications are
still being made.

902
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:46,433
$20 million!

903
01:25:48,808 --> 01:25:52,800
Well, this is a prototype.
Not for sale.

904
01:25:52,825 --> 01:25:53,987
21!

905
01:25:54,035 --> 01:25:58,019
Well, it is still a
prototype, but...

906
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:01,128
23!

907
01:26:02,394 --> 01:26:04,058
24!

908
01:26:06,043 --> 01:26:07,886
$24 million.

909
01:26:07,949 --> 01:26:10,347
$25 million!

910
01:26:10,753 --> 01:26:12,355
Do I hear 26?

911
01:26:12,378 --> 01:26:14,823
That thing can't
leave this building.

912
01:26:14,862 --> 01:26:15,807
26!

913
01:26:15,932 --> 01:26:18,947
Any advance on 26? $27 million!

914
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:20,971
What are you doing? This
animal is not for sale.

915
01:26:20,996 --> 01:26:23,252
Let them have it. We have
to give them a taste.

916
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:29,619
- He's a prototype.
- This prototype is worth $28 million right now.

917
01:26:29,986 --> 01:26:32,751
Relax. We'll make some more.

918
01:26:32,822 --> 01:26:35,064
So will they.

919
01:26:55,939 --> 01:26:57,368
Hey, buddy.

920
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,055
You thinking what I'm thinking?

921
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:04,860
Once, twice, sold!

922
01:27:04,884 --> 01:27:07,032
To the Russian from...

923
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:13,531
Congratulations for purchasing
this magnificent animal...

924
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:23,900
Get this thing out of here!

925
01:29:15,596 --> 01:29:17,205
Mills!

926
01:29:17,464 --> 01:29:19,433
Mills, where are you?

927
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:22,011
I want my bonus.

928
01:29:28,419 --> 01:29:31,942
Holy cow. What are you?

929
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:35,160
I didn't see you on the island.

930
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:55,182
You are a tough guy.

931
01:30:27,658 --> 01:30:30,368
Look at that beauty.

932
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:35,992
You're some kind of hot-rod.
With pretty teeth.

933
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,616
This will make a perfect
centerpiece for my necklace.

934
01:30:59,303 --> 01:31:00,928
Open up...

935
01:31:54,948 --> 01:31:56,980
Move ! Move!

936
01:32:41,903 --> 01:32:43,340
Don't!

937
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:49,403
You two, deserve each other.

938
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:51,113
Maisie, come with me.

939
01:32:51,137 --> 01:32:53,705
You got your money. Walk away.

940
01:32:53,822 --> 01:32:54,994
What are you gonna do, huh?

941
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:56,767
We're gonna stop this.

942
01:32:57,088 --> 01:32:58,830
- All of it!
- How?

943
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,736
What, you're gonna go back in time
before Hammond decides to play god?

944
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,596
You can't put it
back in the box!

945
01:33:03,674 --> 01:33:05,096
- We have to try.
- It's too late.

946
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,002
Maisie, come.

947
01:33:10,609 --> 01:33:13,914
So, you're gonna take
care of her now? Huh?

948
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:16,749
You have no idea what she is.

949
01:33:17,804 --> 01:33:21,093
What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart, huh?

950
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:24,811
Lockwood never had a grandchild.

951
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:27,890
He just wanted his
daughter back.

952
01:33:29,898 --> 01:33:32,531
And he had the technology.

953
01:33:32,847 --> 01:33:35,183
He created another.

954
01:33:36,512 --> 01:33:38,051
He made her again.

955
01:33:41,693 --> 01:33:42,904
Go!

956
01:33:48,457 --> 01:33:50,223
Come on!

957
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:08,614
Get this to Mills. Be very careful.
It's extremely valuable.

958
01:34:08,623 --> 01:34:11,208
You, I need blood samples
from the raptor.

959
01:34:12,012 --> 01:34:13,558
Don't just stand
there like an idiot!

960
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:18,286
Get me 50 cc carfentanil and a
lobotomy kit. It's right there. Now!

961
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:20,801
Come on. Come on.

962
01:34:21,707 --> 01:34:24,551
I need this raptor's blood.

963
01:34:24,855 --> 01:34:26,964
Sure. Go ahead.

964
01:34:27,003 --> 01:34:29,206
Where is that kit?

965
01:34:29,261 --> 01:34:31,065
Okay, now listen to me.

966
01:34:31,113 --> 01:34:33,971
It's better if we cooperated.
But I'm gonna get this blood,

967
01:34:34,003 --> 01:34:36,762
- With or without your help.
- This blood's contaminated.

968
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:39,356
I designed this animal myself.

969
01:34:39,552 --> 01:34:42,901
It's pure. Every cell of
her body was created in a

970
01:34:42,926 --> 01:34:46,645
most controlled environment under
the most demanding conditions.

971
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,163
Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion with a T-Rex,

972
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:51,936
so, it's a sock drawer in there.

973
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,397
You what?

974
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:57,010
Hold, stop! What are you doing?

975
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,003
Saving your life.

976
01:35:03,809 --> 01:35:05,002
Yes!

977
01:35:05,049 --> 01:35:06,346
Stop!

978
01:35:08,276 --> 01:35:10,010
Don't move.

979
01:35:14,844 --> 01:35:16,766
Now, step away from that cage.

980
01:35:16,807 --> 01:35:17,901
Now.

981
01:35:54,019 --> 01:35:56,230
Run. Run!

982
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,470
Run!

983
01:39:25,927 --> 01:39:27,474
You see that?

984
01:39:27,526 --> 01:39:32,166
That's hydrogen cyanide. If it reaches the
containment level, it will kill them all.

985
01:39:33,315 --> 01:39:35,151
The ventilation system is down.

986
01:39:35,283 --> 01:39:37,338
Can you bring it back up?

987
01:40:09,952 --> 01:40:12,764
The server's unresponsive. I
have to reboot the whole system.

988
01:40:12,835 --> 01:40:15,131
- So reboot it.
- I'm trying.

989
01:40:35,078 --> 01:40:37,656
- Franklin, we don't have time.
- I know, I know, I know.

990
01:40:37,734 --> 01:40:38,859
Okay.

991
01:41:19,117 --> 01:41:20,828
Go! Go!

992
01:42:18,537 --> 01:42:22,076
You're okay. Put pressure on it.
Don't look at it. Look at me.

993
01:42:22,107 --> 01:42:24,794
- You have to go find her.
- I can't leave you here.

994
01:42:29,292 --> 01:42:31,229
Go, I'll be fine.

995
01:42:31,284 --> 01:42:32,518
Run!

996
01:45:01,404 --> 01:45:03,513
Maisie, stay down!

997
01:46:07,788 --> 01:46:11,405
Follow me. I know a
way on the outside.

998
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:15,367
Come on.

999
01:46:17,805 --> 01:46:19,398
Come on!

1000
01:46:35,706 --> 01:46:37,151
This way!

1001
01:47:10,204 --> 01:47:11,893
I got you.

1002
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,617
Hey!

1003
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,658
What the hell?

1004
01:49:24,744 --> 01:49:25,806
Hey!

1005
01:49:28,055 --> 01:49:30,874
Hey! You good?

1006
01:49:32,749 --> 01:49:35,584
- Yeah. You?
- Nope!

1007
01:49:35,882 --> 01:49:39,381
Hey, we have a problem downstairs.
I need you to come see this.

1008
01:50:09,336 --> 01:50:10,906
They're all dying.

1009
01:50:10,931 --> 01:50:13,382
The blast damaged the
ventilation system.

1010
01:50:13,408 --> 01:50:15,923
We did everything we could.

1011
01:50:18,298 --> 01:50:20,282
I can open the gates from here.

1012
01:50:21,305 --> 01:50:23,992
Claire, be careful.

1013
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:26,765
We're not on an island anymore.

1014
01:51:22,216 --> 01:51:23,434
Claire....

1015
01:51:23,521 --> 01:51:26,872
You press that button,
there is no going back.

1016
01:51:31,594 --> 01:51:34,086
We can't let them die.

1017
01:52:23,568 --> 01:52:25,233
I had to.

1018
01:52:26,085 --> 01:52:28,038
They're alive.

1019
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:29,788
Like me.

1020
01:54:42,742 --> 01:54:44,225
Hey, girl.

1021
01:54:44,249 --> 01:54:45,624
Owen.

1022
01:54:47,773 --> 01:54:50,913
It's okay. She won't hurt us.

1023
01:55:21,372 --> 01:55:23,982
Blue, come with me.

1024
01:55:28,834 --> 01:55:31,919
We'll take you to a
safe place, okay?

1025
01:56:10,606 --> 01:56:13,371
How many times do you
have to see the evidence?

1026
01:56:13,918 --> 01:56:16,832
How many times must
a point be made?

1027
01:56:17,582 --> 01:56:20,644
We're causing our
own extinction.

1028
01:56:20,895 --> 01:56:23,628
Too many red lines
have been crossed.

1029
01:56:24,176 --> 01:56:27,980
And our home has, in fundamental
ways, been polluted by

1030
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:30,566
avarice, and

1031
01:56:30,668 --> 01:56:33,308
political megalomania.

1032
01:56:33,903 --> 01:56:39,278
Genetic power has now been unleashed. And
of course, that's gonna be catastrophic.

1033
01:56:39,395 --> 01:56:44,317
This change was inevitable, from the moment we
brought the first dinosaur back from extinction.

1034
01:56:44,841 --> 01:56:47,574
We convince ourselves that
sudden change, is something that

1035
01:56:47,591 --> 01:56:51,590
happens outside the normal order
of things, like a car crash.

1036
01:56:52,017 --> 01:56:54,657
Or that it's beyond our control, like a fatal illness.

1037
01:56:54,712 --> 01:56:59,009
We don't conceive of sudden,
radical, irrational change as

1038
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:02,024
woven into the very
fabric of existence.

1039
01:57:02,345 --> 01:57:05,423
Yet, I can assure you,
it most assuredly is.

1040
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,970
And it's happening now.

1041
01:57:10,586 --> 01:57:15,101
Humans and dinosaurs are now
gonna be forced to co-exist.

1042
01:57:18,093 --> 01:57:21,100
These creatures were
here before us.

1043
01:57:21,662 --> 01:57:25,014
And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.

1044
01:57:30,427 --> 01:57:34,294
We're gonna have to adjust to new
threats that we can't imagine.

1045
01:57:40,194 --> 01:57:42,599
We've entered a new era.

1046
01:57:43,803 --> 01:57:47,615
Welcome, to Jurassic World.
