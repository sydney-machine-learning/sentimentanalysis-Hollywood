1
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:33,402
I'm going to California

2
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:36,363
And I'll be sleeping out every night

3
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:39,199
I'm going to California

4
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,973
And I'll be sleeping out every night

5
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,623
'Cause them Oklahoma women

6
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:49,626
Well, they just ain't a-treatin' me right

7
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:58,218
Well, I'd rather drink muddy water

8
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,971
Oh, and sleep in a hollow log

9
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,932
But I would rather drink muddy water

10
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:07,036
Oh, and sleep in a hollow log

11
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:11,440
Than to be down here in Texas

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,067
Treated like a low-down dog

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,576
With them California waters

14
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:25,704
Oh, they taste like cherry wine

15
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:28,415
Them California waters

16
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:31,439
Taste just like cherry wine

17
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:33,691
Yeah.

18
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,648
Cherry wine.

19
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,259
God dammit, Woody.

20
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,954
I've got half a notion to pull up stakes
and hit the road for California.

21
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:46,266
I been thinking about
heading down the Gulf of Mexico,

22
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,477
or the Rio Grande Valley.

23
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:52,832
Just somewheres
I can grow some fruit. Peaches.

24
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:56,652
Them Indian blood peaches
with that red meat.

25
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,571
Shit fire, Carl, why down there?

26
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,449
In California you just
plop a seed in the ground,

27
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,868
you find a sprout the very next day.

28
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:07,221
Well, it seems I sure gotta do somethin'.

29
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:11,479
I just don't know what's gonna happen
to everybody around here.

30
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:16,112
You, folks, sure are depressing.

31
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:19,779
Well, we got one.

32
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,514
Put a buck's worth in, Pop.

33
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:29,209
Yes, sir. A buck's worth of
the finest gasoline in Texas.

34
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:12,477
You boys got any news?

35
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:16,627
Ain't nothing interesting to tell about,
except people are moving outta these parts.

36
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,277
My name's Collister,

37
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:23,864
and I've been running all over this
here state to them fortune tellers,

38
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,950
ain't one of them's told me a damn thing.

39
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,369
Someone tell me
something worth listening to,

40
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,564
and I'll pay them a dollar
good American money.

41
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:39,713
It's been pretty dusty around here.

42
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:41,048
That ain't worth nothing.

43
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:44,243
Hell, Woody,
that ain't worth nothing for sure.

44
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:50,245
Well, I ain't much for fortune telling.

45
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:53,852
You're a inside man.

46
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:56,501
Got a big job with the oil refinery.

47
00:03:57,998 --> 00:03:59,215
How'd you know that?

48
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:08,200
Ain't nobody else got money to waste
on fortune teller, soda pop.

49
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:12,604
Keep going.

50
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,001
Well, them creases
in between your eyebrows

51
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:21,355
tell me you're probably a man
who takes his work serious.

52
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,926
Always looking for a way
to do things better.

53
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:27,761
You got 50 cents.

54
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,789
Keep talking.

55
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,769
Oh, you probably got some kind of idea.

56
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,667
An invention of some kind.

57
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,858
Big company wants to buy you out.

58
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,258
You got a paper dollar,
if you can tell me when to do it.

59
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:50,550
Hell, uh, I ain't no mind reader.

60
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:00,127
You're the only one
I ever met that didn't claim

61
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,379
to know everything in the whole world.

62
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,423
What's your name?

63
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,946
Woody. Woody Guthrie.

64
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:12,031
Well, Guthrie, I'll spread the word.

65
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,408
Worth every penny.

66
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,436
Thank you kindly.

67
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:20,772
There you are, Pop, and there's a nickel
for the coke, dollar for the gas.

68
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,607
...and the Mama Bear says,

69
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:26,278
"Well, ain't nobody gonna eat
none of my porridge and get away with it."

70
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:30,449
So she takes a pair of sheep shears
and she cuts every hair

71
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:33,018
off the top of that little kid's head.

72
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,098
Yeah, ain't that something?

73
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:41,835
Then, uh, you know,
old Goldilocks, she just

74
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:46,173
goes on back into the forest and, uh,
she goes to sleep for about 20 years

75
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:49,271
and when she wakes up,
all her hair is growed back.

76
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:54,014
Well, looks pretty good, don't it?

77
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:56,287
It looks darn good.

78
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:03,382
But, there ain't nobody around here
gonna pay you to talk to them.

79
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,319
Oh, now, that fellow
down at the gas station

80
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,823
said I was the best fortune teller
he had ever seen.

81
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,802
That weren't nothing but happenstance,
and you know it.

82
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:18,288
You could be making regular money
with your sign painting, Woody,

83
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:19,389
if you tried.

84
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:24,278
There just ain't no sense
in just harping on it, Mary.

85
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,240
It ain't no good.

86
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,970
You could do it, Woody.

87
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,667
You could do them so special,
somebody'd be sure and want them.

88
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:49,173
Come on in.

89
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:54,599
Talk it over

90
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:00,518
Lay your head upon my shoulder

91
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:06,983
She's my curly-headed baby

92
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,243
Come from sunny Tennessee

93
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,887
Oh, but I ain't really a doctor.

94
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:18,223
Well, she ain't sick, exactly.

95
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:21,810
Her oldest girl died of the dust pneumonia
almost a week ago.

96
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,855
She ain't drunk a drop of water since.
She just can't swallow.

97
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:26,690
I don't see how there's anything I can...

98
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,942
Now look, some fortune tellers
have got the gift.

99
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,737
Healing, laying on the hands,
the discerning of spirits.

100
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:35,156
I ain't really a fortune teller.

101
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:37,617
Poor little thing.
We can't just let her waste away.

102
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,390
Go on, go on.

103
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,659
Ma'am?

104
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,378
Do you have faith that you'll be cured?

105
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,096
Well, look...

106
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,984
Your daughter.

107
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:31,696
Don't you believe she's up in heaven?

108
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,242
Well, uh...

109
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:40,322
That means you believe in God.

110
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:44,869
And if there is a God,
then it was him gave you your mind.

111
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, everybody knows,
mind's the boss of the whole body.

112
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,903
Just tell all the nerves
and muscles what to do.

113
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:57,927
Your arms and hands and back.

114
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,305
Throat.

115
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,714
You don't wanna die, do you?

116
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:17,658
Leave your husband
and your kids all alone?

117
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:23,202
Your husband wants you to talk to him,
don't he? And your kids to boot.

118
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:26,292
Ain't no two ways about that.

119
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,687
Can I have some water here?

120
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,605
Away all that monkey business.

121
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:34,335
Just send a message
straight down there to your throat,

122
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:41,116
mouth, and tell them to just
swig down this here water.

123
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:42,684
Thank you.

124
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,181
Just try. Just do it.

125
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:51,811
And afterwards, you...
You tell me how dandy it was.

126
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:01,444
Now, you swallow it. Now, swallow it.

127
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,502
It was easy.

128
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:12,956
You did it. You can do it some more.

129
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:15,675
Now, next couple of days,
I want you two ladies just to

130
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,944
pour water down this here lady's throat.

131
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:22,345
Why, you can have a water drinking
contest every now and then.

132
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:29,352
You just talk to her now about everything.

133
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:32,980
Talk to her.

134
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:35,820
You'll be okay.

135
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:45,326
See, you don't...
You don't owe me nothing.

136
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,623
Bless you, Mr. Guthrie.

137
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:56,754
Did it.

138
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:01,930
I think.

139
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,227
Good afternoon, Donna Jo.

140
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,954
Oh, good afternoon, Woody.

141
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:38,358
Woody, do you and Mary
have any use for a bedroom set?

142
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,588
It's real nice. It's called
The Waterfall Design or something.

143
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:47,263
I just hate to leave it sit there.

144
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:49,723
Howdy, Jesse.

145
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:55,726
Uh, sure.

146
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:59,462
Sure, I guess we can, uh,
we can do something with it.

147
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:02,173
Good. There's an old chair in there, too.

148
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,676
We just ain't got room for everything.

149
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:05,969
Where you folks going?

150
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:07,446
California.

151
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:14,123
I don't know, it just seems like
everything run out around here

152
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:16,879
when Jesse got laid off.

153
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,443
Oh, you all are welcome to anything that
you find in there that you wanna use.

154
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,843
Okay, thank you kindly, Donna Jo.
You folks take care.

155
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:50,722
Might get us some jobs in that new
department store down in Amarillo.

156
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:53,558
Hell, Pa, I ain't gonna be
no shoe salesman.

157
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:55,476
Well, there might be something else.

158
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,500
Well, it's too dammed
far out there anyhow.

159
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:02,797
You tell her that when she's begging
for milk in the morning.

160
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,069
Tell her it's too far to travel.

161
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,467
Mary, it's 62 miles.

162
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:13,620
Maybe you could sing one of your songs
to her or tell her fortune instead.

163
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,496
Mary, just don't start in on me, okay?

164
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,874
Now, it don't do no good
to be carrying on.

165
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:21,899
Times and the weather are bad enough.
It just don't do no good.

166
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:25,110
I don't mean to be starting in.

167
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:28,885
I don't mean to be always at you, Woody,

168
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,363
but it just don't seem fair.

169
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:36,247
Even your brother's been out looking
for something and he's just a boy.

170
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,693
Hey, how about me painting some
new signs there on your truck, Jethro?

171
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,591
No, not today, Woody.

172
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,560
What in the hell are you doing anyway?

173
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,895
I told you I wanted white on black.

174
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:06,858
Yeah, I thought you'd like red better.
Shows up from a mile away.

175
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,361
I asked for white on black
and you give me this red bitch thing?

176
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,682
Was you planning on getting paid for this?

177
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:20,805
Well, I was planning on it.

178
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,749
Well, just plan away, Guthrie.

179
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:25,084
What am I supposed to do
with this red bitch anyways?

180
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:26,481
Well...

181
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:31,316
Why don't you fold it five ways

182
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,552
and stick it where the sun don't shine.

183
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:37,430
I'll tell you what else I don't need,
I don't need none of your damn lip.

184
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,806
That's what I don't need, Guthrie.

185
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:42,251
Ain't you kids got nothing better to do
than lollygag around here?

186
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,709
She's my curly-headed baby

187
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:55,052
Used to sit on daddy's knee

188
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:01,513
She's my curly-headed baby

189
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,064
Comes from sunny Tennessee

190
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:13,821
I'm gonna tell you 'bout these women

191
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:20,039
I'm gonna tell you what they do

192
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,912
Lay their head upon your shoulder

193
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:29,816
Flirt around...

194
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,964
Did you really write that song about me?

195
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:36,131
Oh, sure. Sure it's about you. Damn right.

196
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:38,741
Curly-headed lady

197
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,343
Remember what you asked me?

198
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:43,267
It hasn't been outta my mind for a second.

199
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,106
I don't care.

200
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,917
Care about what?

201
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:49,485
If we do.

202
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,671
Do what?

203
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,194
You know. Come on.

204
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,786
Guess this town ain't entirely dead yet.

205
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,832
I don't know if you knew it or not,

206
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:30,560
but you're looking at an insane man.

207
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:33,821
Well, uh...

208
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:39,156
Why don't you take off
a couple of sweaters and sit down?

209
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:46,659
I really am insane.

210
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,173
Hell, yeah, so am I.

211
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:03,014
I heard tale about you in the next town
and thought I better come.

212
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:07,021
I been in the insane asylum twice.

213
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:08,685
You have?

214
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:13,569
I had better watch out
to have you around the place.

215
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,989
I wasn't crazy when they sent me there,

216
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:20,200
but then I beat up on two guards
in the pea patch

217
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:24,430
and now I'm here
and even if they get me pretty quick,

218
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,660
well, I wanted to tell you,
I got newsreels in my head.

219
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,853
Newsreels?

220
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:36,335
Yeah. Since I was a kid
and my mama always told me I was crazy.

221
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,278
They just never stop.

222
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,755
What kinda newsreels?

223
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:45,893
That the boom is over
and the weeds are blowing out.

224
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:51,290
And the dust storms are getting darker
and there's people fighting and killing

225
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,392
and there's kids sick.

226
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:57,696
Ain't nothing wrong with your head.

227
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:02,718
I see these shapes and designs

228
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:05,492
and I see how to build roads better and...

229
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,949
Is them your brushes?

230
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:13,371
Uh, sure. Yeah. I'm, uh,

231
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,583
kind of a painter.

232
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,761
I sure wish I could sit down
and paint all them pictures I see.

233
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,116
Sometimes I think
I could just spend forever

234
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:28,286
just painting and painting
all them pictures.

235
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:29,638
Well...

236
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,724
Why don't you just take these?

237
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,210
Take 'em? I ain't got no money.

238
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,278
You don't need no money, just take them.

239
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,298
I got plenty more.

240
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:43,823
And some of this ink here.
Take those ideas

241
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:50,558
and find yourself some place where, uh,
where nobody, uh...

242
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:55,021
Where nobody'll bother you, and just,
uh, put those things down.

243
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:58,546
Just put those things down on paper.
You know?

244
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,163
Now bow to the partner

245
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:13,664
Now out to the corner

246
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,643
Join hands, turn to the left

247
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:22,073
All form with your left hand
right and left hand

248
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,782
Turn on around and come on back

249
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,493
Tie the knot

250
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:34,206
All form with your left hand
right and left hand

251
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,854
Onto the next cowboy move

252
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:39,690
Meet your partner, go

253
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,589
Turn half to the right

254
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,280
Turn on around and come on back

255
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,257
All look around

256
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:50,885
Tie the knot

257
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:57,685
All form with the left hand
right and left hand

258
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,775
Do-si-do

259
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,107
About turn

260
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,741
Go on now

261
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,269
Dust storm.

262
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:18,813
Dust storm is coming.

263
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:21,732
Dust storm. Dust storm.

264
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,781
Dust storm.

265
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,513
Hey! Hey!

266
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,909
Better get along home, Woody.

267
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:01,974
- You better get inside, Woody.
- Okay.

268
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:19,266
Well, looks like things ain't gonna
be too pleasurable around here.

269
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,519
No, it ain't. It's gonna be a real zinger.

270
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,496
- Can I help you?
- I got it.

271
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:29,126
Let's move the couch, Pa.

272
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,666
You're gonna ruin them things,
playing them in this dust.

273
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:45,835
A little dirt won't hurt.

274
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:06,501
And I hate to hear that
ol' soft whistle blowing

275
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:12,803
It's that long lonesome train
whistling down

276
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,013
And you and I go down to the train

277
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:32,420
Morning, Jimmy.

278
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,627
Morning, Woody.

279
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:50,526
Well, uh,

280
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:54,234
got any more dances lined up?

281
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:57,233
Ain't heard of none.

282
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,386
What about that place over at Catersville?

283
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:02,580
They was giving a dance a month.

284
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:06,492
Yeah. Used to.

285
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,675
Yeah, well...

286
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,921
Take her easy, Jimmy.

287
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,462
Hold it, let me give you a push.

288
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:37,314
All right there, Woody.

289
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,103
What do you think it is, Joe?

290
00:26:51,203 --> 00:26:53,105
I don't know, Woody.

291
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:55,128
- You're stuck.
- Thanks a lot, though.

292
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,048
It's dust, that's what it is.

293
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:01,338
Bye, Woody.

294
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:09,393
Seems like things just ain't
going so good, around here.

295
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:12,895
That's the way they's going.

296
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:01,522
Hi, honey.

297
00:30:08,692 --> 00:30:10,035
Hi, honey.

298
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,565
See you later, Woody.

299
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:10,232
Morning.

300
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,734
Get down. Get down, boy.

301
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,177
Get down.

302
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:18,840
This train going to California?

303
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:21,593
It's going in that direction.

304
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:23,937
Can't ask for more than that.

305
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:31,420
Uh, are you boys gonna catch this train?

306
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,754
Yeah.

307
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:35,090
Mind if I ride along?

308
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,407
No.

309
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:53,630
How come we're sitting here so long?

310
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:55,843
Oh.

311
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:25,056
You're cute.

312
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:27,329
Welcome aboard, boys.

313
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:30,037
Welcome, cowboys.

314
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:31,921
Kiss my ass.

315
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,827
Mind moving over
a little bit, there, friend?

316
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,395
Much obliged.

317
00:34:53,476 --> 00:34:55,045
My name's Guthrie.

318
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,922
Slim Snedeger.

319
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:58,048
Slim.

320
00:34:58,148 --> 00:34:59,758
That there is Po Steve.

321
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:01,134
Hi, Steve.

322
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,636
I'm Crippled Whitey.

323
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:04,679
Whitey. Crippled Whitey, huh?

324
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,372
Crippled Whitey is a fight spotter.

325
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:09,351
A fight spotter?

326
00:35:09,451 --> 00:35:14,439
Yeah. I can spot a fist-fight on the street
three blocks before I come to it.

327
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:17,734
I can spot a gang-fight
an hour before it happens.

328
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:21,238
That way, I tip off the boys,
and they know how to lay their bets.

329
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:24,533
You, uh, got a fight spotted now, Whitey?

330
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:26,180
Got a whopper.

331
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,599
When's it gonna happen?

332
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:32,707
Not more than ten minutes.

333
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:34,459
Aw, bullshit.

334
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,171
You watch your tongue,
you young jackass, or I'll tear you apart.

335
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:41,007
Hey Whitey, if one doesn't start
a fight himself,

336
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:44,177
you're gonna whip up one of your own, huh?

337
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:48,748
When it starts, I'll be sure
to bust a box over your head, fella.

338
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:52,978
Cantankerous, ain't he?

339
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:57,224
Yeah. But it be he's like that sometime.

340
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:02,675
Riding these boxcars and things
can make you meaner than 52 rattlesnakes.

341
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:06,299
Beats walking, though.

342
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:09,511
Don't it?

343
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:17,161
Hey!

344
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:19,214
Don't push me out!

345
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:21,432
Whitey.

346
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:25,278
Whitey, let go!

347
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:27,843
Hey, Whitey!

348
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:42,962
Hey, we're slowing down.

349
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,814
Let's jump off this son-of-a-bitch.

350
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:46,566
- Jump?
- Jump!

351
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,594
- Go ahead, jump!
- Wait a minute.

352
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:51,554
And, when you hit the ground,
be on your feet.

353
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:53,702
That way, you won't break your ass.

354
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,059
Come on.

355
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:48,845
Come on up here.

356
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:52,724
What's wrong?

357
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:56,327
My brushes. Damn, I lost my brushes.

358
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:58,830
You gonna lose your ass
if you don't come on up here.

359
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,207
You're hanging half-way
between heaven and hell.

360
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:02,900
Come on up here.

361
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:07,547
Let's move on down the car there.

362
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,695
- Damn.
- Let's move on down.

363
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:26,083
Them was about
the best brushes money could buy.

364
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,007
You a artist?

365
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:35,784
Oh, I was hoping to pick up some
money painting signs on the way.

366
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:38,057
I'm pretty good at sign painting.

367
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:40,810
Sign painter, huh?

368
00:39:42,432 --> 00:39:45,710
I expect you're gonna do
all right in California.

369
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,187
Know why?

370
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:52,401
'Cause they is putting up signs and
buildings and everything out there.

371
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:56,721
You been?

372
00:39:56,821 --> 00:40:01,042
Who, me? Naw.
But I heard a heap of talk about it.

373
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:06,836
They tell me California is a place
for some real nice living.

374
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,676
That's what I hear.

375
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:14,506
What're you gonna do when you get there?

376
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,868
Well...

377
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:19,577
Whoo!

378
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:22,351
Well, first thing I'm gonna do

379
00:40:23,473 --> 00:40:27,228
is take me a long look
at that Pacific Ocean,

380
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:31,923
'cause I been wanting
to see that bugger all my life.

381
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:35,385
Then, I expect
I'll ease on down to one of them

382
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:38,910
fruit orchards
and get me a job picking fruit.

383
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:43,160
They tell me fruit is just begging
to be picked out there.

384
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:46,062
You know what I mean?

385
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,460
You drop a seed in the ground,

386
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:50,942
and you blink your eye,

387
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:54,863
and you got yourself
a tree busting with fruit.

388
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:56,364
Yeah?

389
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:02,228
Everything a man needs

390
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:06,224
is right out there in California.

391
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:08,960
Know what I mean?

392
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,254
Everything a man needs.

393
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:12,731
Yep.

394
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:01,154
Let's check them, boys.

395
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,878
Shit! We coming into Acomita.

396
00:42:57,335 --> 00:42:59,529
Come on outta there, you yahoos.

397
00:42:59,629 --> 00:43:02,724
Come on. Come on outta there, now, dammit!

398
00:43:03,174 --> 00:43:04,909
Get outta there, woman.

399
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:07,245
- No!
- Pull her out!

400
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:37,083
Okay, boys.

401
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,622
You old bastard, ice didn't help this one.

402
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:53,750
Smells like he's been in there for a week.

403
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,129
You gentlemen haven't been taking
full advantage of the railroad's facilities.

404
00:43:58,229 --> 00:44:00,673
We want you to ride in full comfort,

405
00:44:00,773 --> 00:44:05,028
so we're gonna put you inside,
where you can stretch out your legs

406
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:08,990
and rest your heads back on doilies.

407
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:12,584
Wouldn't that be nice?

408
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:16,481
How much money you got?

409
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:19,525
A dollar fifty, dollar eight,
I don't know.

410
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:23,550
He can ride all the way to Holden on that.
Write him up a ticket.

411
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:28,635
How much you got?

412
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,872
Don't hear nothing jingling.

413
00:44:32,972 --> 00:44:35,333
Don't feel nothing folding.

414
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:38,107
Boy, you appear to be a vagrant.

415
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,443
We have a curfew on vagrants.

416
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:44,592
Or didn't you know that?

417
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:47,821
Uh, I don't believe I did. When is it?

418
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:50,539
Every hour on the hour.

419
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:04,136
Get on your hands and knees, sonny.

420
00:45:13,346 --> 00:45:16,165
I could shoot you in the hand if I wanted,

421
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:19,235
or in the thigh, in the soft part.

422
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:23,107
Or I could take you out in them weeds
after everybody's gone.

423
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,429
Your mother'd wait a long time
for those letters you promised to write.

424
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,170
Come on, move on, let's get aboard.
Come on.

425
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:39,580
Keep it moving.

426
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:42,984
Now the rest of you
get your ass down the road.

427
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:46,509
Come this way again, gentlemen,
and it'll be thirty days.

428
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:49,807
Thirty big 'uns. Well, move it out.

429
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:14,036
So long, Guthrie. See ya in California.

430
00:46:14,573 --> 00:46:16,371
Take it easy, Slim.

431
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:19,211
But take it!

432
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:41,335
Howdy, Pastor, uh, my name is Guthrie.

433
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:43,954
I, uh...

434
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:50,215
Well, uh, if you got any work I could do

435
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:53,305
for just a small meal of some kind.

436
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:58,098
Well, sir, I would do anything to earn it.

437
00:47:59,804 --> 00:48:02,648
Son, I've been in the service all my life,

438
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:06,899
and have seen thousands of men like you
go to work for a meal.

439
00:48:08,938 --> 00:48:12,238
However, at this moment,
there isn't any work to be done.

440
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:16,992
Therefore, if I were to feed you,
it would be an act of charity,

441
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:21,243
which may be all right for the moment,

442
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:24,788
but, uh, could cause harm in the long run.

443
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:30,544
You seem to have retained
your pride and your dignity,

444
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:34,422
since you didn't ask outright
for a free meal.

445
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:37,262
And that's to your credit.

446
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:41,771
But, to answer your question,
there's no work to be done.

447
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:46,521
Therefore, you, uh, can't earn your meal.

448
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:48,986
Good luck, son.

449
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:07,521
Oh, we've been all over.

450
00:49:07,621 --> 00:49:12,276
Niagara Falls, Washington DC,
New Orleans, Chicago.

451
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:15,488
Spent a couple weeks
this past winter in Miami Beach.

452
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:17,198
It must've been real interesting.

453
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:20,785
You bet it was,
meeting and talking with different people,

454
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:24,955
seeing all the sights.
Going in the unusual restaurants.

455
00:49:25,055 --> 00:49:28,376
You know, I found out something
about eating, since I been on my trip.

456
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:29,585
Oh really? What was that?

457
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:32,755
I found out that, uh, the more you eat,
the more you shit.

458
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:00,491
Well, I said to the rich

459
00:50:00,591 --> 00:50:03,786
Give your goods to the poor

460
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:08,107
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

461
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:13,170
Jesus was a man

462
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,364
A carpenter by hand

463
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:19,907
His followers true and brave

464
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:27,251
One day a little coward
named Judas Iscariot

465
00:50:28,077 --> 00:50:31,957
Laid Jesus Christ in his grave

466
00:50:39,713 --> 00:50:42,575
Put your money away, Guthrie.
It's on the house.

467
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:43,993
You really sing great.

468
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:45,744
You know the one I like the best?

469
00:50:45,844 --> 00:50:49,874
You know that one that you sing
about that dead cowboy guy?

470
00:50:49,974 --> 00:50:52,272
I like it. It's good.

471
00:50:53,102 --> 00:50:56,447
I wrote that song especially just for you.

472
00:50:59,817 --> 00:51:02,491
In the pig's ass you did, Guthrie.

473
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:38,797
Just seems walking's better than stalking.

474
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:40,841
To who's you talking?

475
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:42,488
Man is a-walking.

476
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:46,285
Why is he talking?

477
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,374
Keep on walking.

478
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:52,878
Keep on walking.

479
00:51:53,662 --> 00:51:56,791
Walking and talking. Talking and walking.

480
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:01,629
Walking and talking. Talking and walking.

481
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,365
California.

482
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:49,618
Hey, take a look at that. California.

483
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:51,954
Everything a man needs.

484
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:53,539
See it right there.

485
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,665
Yeah.

486
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:58,085
Yes, sir, California state line.

487
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:16,353
What's going on?

488
00:53:16,453 --> 00:53:19,252
I don't know.
Looks like some kind of hold up.

489
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:24,590
Maybe a accident, or something.

490
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,718
Accident, hell.
They're turning people back.

491
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:46,634
What's going on?

492
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:49,783
Oh, they're checking everybody out,
to see if you got any money.

493
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:52,556
Gotta have $50 to get across the border.

494
00:53:52,656 --> 00:53:53,974
Fifty dollars?

495
00:53:54,074 --> 00:53:55,496
Yeah, in cash.

496
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:57,102
That's right.

497
00:53:57,202 --> 00:54:01,503
The Los Angeles Police came out here
and set up this blockade.

498
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:04,568
Are we that close to Los Angeles?

499
00:54:04,668 --> 00:54:06,841
Yeah, about 300 miles.

500
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,512
Jesus.

501
00:54:15,012 --> 00:54:16,705
What're you gonna do?

502
00:54:16,805 --> 00:54:18,666
Ain't no sense in waiting in line,
a half day,

503
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:20,584
just to get shoved back by them.

504
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:22,711
I might as well turn back right now.

505
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:24,188
You coming?

506
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:26,256
No,

507
00:54:26,356 --> 00:54:30,469
I reckon there's more than one way
to get across the border

508
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:33,573
if you don't have a family tagging along.

509
00:54:36,366 --> 00:54:37,743
Look, uh,

510
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:42,290
why don't you take this.
It ain't no $50, but, uh,

511
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,088
you got them kids and all.

512
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,383
Thanks. I appreciate that, friend.

513
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:53,426
Maybe we'll both be millionaire's sons
next time we meet each other.

514
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:56,390
- Maybe so.
- Hope so, anyway.

515
00:54:57,888 --> 00:54:59,856
- Take care.
- Kind of you.

516
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:40,101
Howdy.

517
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,963
Hey.

518
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:11,195
Hey.

519
00:56:11,295 --> 00:56:13,822
Why don't you come over
and share my bundle, huh?

520
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:15,390
Come on.

521
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:17,301
Sure.

522
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:22,331
Thanks, mister.

523
00:56:22,431 --> 00:56:24,729
I can't stand chattering teeth.

524
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:34,301
Better watch yourself,
'cause by the time she gets here,

525
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:37,371
she's gonna be moving
like a turpentined cat.

526
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,434
You sure you know what you're doing?

527
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:44,912
Them guards won't do nothing
once she's moving.

528
00:56:45,495 --> 00:56:48,690
Get us into LA before
you know what happened.

529
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:25,035
Ain't that a son-of-a-bitch?

530
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,379
I never seen a train take off so...

531
00:57:35,462 --> 00:57:37,214
You got him, Sam.

532
01:00:35,517 --> 01:00:40,023
It is about as clean
as this wall is gonna get.

533
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:43,216
Oh, yes. Did you get up there?
Right on top there?

534
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:44,843
Yep, I sure did. Where's my chili?

535
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:46,762
I'm very choosey over there, you know.

536
01:00:46,862 --> 01:00:48,430
Well, what's your name?

537
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:50,703
- Uh, Woody.
- Yeah, Woody.

538
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,478
Yes sir, best chili in the city.

539
01:00:54,578 --> 01:00:56,480
Hey, goodbye fellas.

540
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,710
Best in the world,
as far as I'm concerned.

541
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:08,241
Here. Have some onion and crackers.

542
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:09,493
Put lots of onion in it.

543
01:01:09,593 --> 01:01:11,620
- Tastes good that way.
- Mmm-hmm.

544
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,313
Hey, now, look at this mess, huh?

545
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:16,741
Just one bowl of chili and lotta mess.

546
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:23,107
Do you know where a fella
can get a job hereabouts?

547
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:25,050
You just come in town?

548
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,323
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, this morning.

549
01:01:27,652 --> 01:01:29,120
You better go home.

550
01:01:30,822 --> 01:01:33,182
A bowl of chili and crackers!

551
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,361
- Hey, deadhead.
- Push it down a little.

552
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:45,695
You mean, let it down?

553
01:01:45,795 --> 01:01:47,864
You know what I mean. Don't get smart.

554
01:01:47,964 --> 01:01:49,807
Okay, this is as far as it'll go down.

555
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,535
If I let it down it won't go on...

556
01:01:51,635 --> 01:01:52,911
I can't even lift the thing.

557
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:54,871
It won't go on the hub. Get on there.

558
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:56,939
It keeps slipping.

559
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:01,820
Would you just like to do this yourself?

560
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:05,069
Looks like a mighty stubborn tire.

561
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:09,198
Just like everything else.

562
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:10,887
Be glad to help.

563
01:02:10,987 --> 01:02:12,739
We'd sure appreciate it.

564
01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:14,825
Yeah.

565
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:25,802
Oh, this wheel's bent.

566
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:27,178
Bent?

567
01:02:30,632 --> 01:02:33,556
Seems like everything
in California is bent.

568
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:48,029
I hope we find something in this place.

569
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:50,285
Yeah.

570
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:53,680
She just needs milk real soon.

571
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,202
We'll be okay.

572
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:45,958
What the hell's going on here?

573
01:03:46,207 --> 01:03:49,051
How come all these people
are living like this?

574
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:51,588
It ain't no different.

575
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:55,926
It's the God damn same as all the rest.

576
01:03:57,427 --> 01:04:01,773
The growers, they need three
or four hundred workers.

577
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:07,087
They put out leaflets and posters,
and advertise for a thousand,

578
01:04:07,187 --> 01:04:09,235
and 1200 showed up.

579
01:04:12,484 --> 01:04:16,785
They got the first ones that get here,
crammed inside them shacks over there.

580
01:04:19,282 --> 01:04:21,685
They're the ones that
are working pretty steady.

581
01:04:21,785 --> 01:04:24,604
All the rest of us are sitting
on our asses every morning,

582
01:04:24,704 --> 01:04:27,503
hoping they're gonna need extra workers.

583
01:04:29,334 --> 01:04:33,635
Hell, I worked three days
in the last two weeks.

584
01:04:34,589 --> 01:04:37,092
And the wages, they doesn't buy...

585
01:04:39,427 --> 01:04:41,145
The wages...

586
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:45,441
I don't know.

587
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:48,358
Makes me sick just talking about it.

588
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:58,660
What're we gonna do then?
We got nothing left.

589
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,492
Ain't got no choice.

590
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,839
You're welcome to spend the night
in the truck if you want.

591
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,580
Seems to me, something
ought to be done about this.

592
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,932
There's nothing.

593
01:05:28,476 --> 01:05:30,524
There's always something.

594
01:05:31,187 --> 01:05:34,862
There's been some talk
about forming a union

595
01:05:35,692 --> 01:05:38,036
and going on strike, but...

596
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:45,419
Hell, Woody, not many people
can afford to miss a day's work.

597
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:56,780
By the time they call on us to pick,
we're more than happy to work for

598
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,553
four cents a bushel.

599
01:06:10,393 --> 01:06:14,899
What do you say, uh,
if I took this little ol' guitar into town?

600
01:06:16,232 --> 01:06:20,157
Maybe I can, uh, pick up a dime or two.

601
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:28,036
You coming back?

602
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:31,752
I got no place to sleep,
except in your truck.

603
01:06:32,832 --> 01:06:35,426
Hell, yeah, go ahead and take it,

604
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:39,802
I ain't in too much of a mood
for using it anyway.

605
01:06:40,757 --> 01:06:42,009
Thanks.

606
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:44,514
See you later.

607
01:07:52,996 --> 01:07:57,297
Tell ya what, I'll paint you a new sign
out there, for a bowl of that soup.

608
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:05,642
Well, I'll tell you what.
It's not necessary. The food is free.

609
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:09,934
Well, suppose I said,
I don't want no free food.

610
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:14,901
Well, suppose I said,
we don't have any other kind?

611
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:25,537
Well, I guess I'd have to say,
"Please pass the soup."

612
01:08:32,994 --> 01:08:34,541
Do you play?

613
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:36,456
Yep.

614
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:43,446
I studied piano years ago.
I never had the patience.

615
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:44,593
That so?

616
01:08:45,048 --> 01:08:46,220
Yes.

617
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,412
Would you really paint us a sign?

618
01:08:51,512 --> 01:08:53,059
For food?

619
01:08:53,514 --> 01:08:54,982
For a favor.

620
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:57,861
I'd have to think about that.

621
01:09:00,063 --> 01:09:02,737
Uh, we don't have any painting right now.

622
01:09:03,191 --> 01:09:06,261
Oh, I wanna... I wanna paint a sign.

623
01:09:06,361 --> 01:09:08,489
Why don't we bring some tomorrow?

624
01:09:10,948 --> 01:09:15,374
Yeah, well, I'll, uh,
see if I can come back.

625
01:09:16,913 --> 01:09:18,881
Uh, thanks for the soup.

626
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:30,594
Red and white paint. It's pretty nice.

627
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:32,978
Red and white.

628
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,572
Well, I was down in the hen house

629
01:10:07,672 --> 01:10:09,824
On my knees

630
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:13,828
I thought I heard a chicken sneeze

631
01:10:13,928 --> 01:10:16,181
It was only a rooster

632
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:19,125
Saying his prayers

633
01:10:19,225 --> 01:10:22,479
Thanking his God for the hens upstairs

634
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:26,299
Just taking it easy

635
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:28,800
Oh, lady, what'd you say?

636
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,593
Get him, Bill!

637
01:10:55,928 --> 01:11:00,667
Quiet down, now quiet.
Now, we need 30 more pickers for today.

638
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:03,777
Quiet. Quiet!

639
01:11:04,937 --> 01:11:07,486
We're paying four cents a bushel!

640
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:09,863
Four cents!

641
01:11:10,818 --> 01:11:14,514
Well, line up over here
by the gate in single file.

642
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:17,037
Stop pushing and shoving over there.

643
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:25,716
All right, line up over here
by the gate, in single file.

644
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:28,594
Okay, men, hold it. Line up over here.

645
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:37,662
Quiet! Quiet!

646
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:41,062
We're looking for pickers,
not a bunch of sand-eaters!

647
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:46,563
Keep on shoving and we won't take anybody!

648
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:08,426
Cheapskate!

649
01:12:22,014 --> 01:12:23,607
Bastards.

650
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,568
God damn bastards.

651
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,881
That's all they're taking, 30 people?

652
01:12:29,981 --> 01:12:32,029
That's it. That's all they ever take.

653
01:12:34,443 --> 01:12:36,888
Well, hell, why do you stay here?
Listen, why don't you

654
01:12:36,988 --> 01:12:39,515
go to one of them other camps?
Maybe they're hiring more there.

655
01:12:39,615 --> 01:12:42,143
Oh, it don't make no difference.

656
01:12:42,243 --> 01:12:44,245
I mean, they all work the same.

657
01:12:45,538 --> 01:12:48,667
It's the fourth one we've been to and

658
01:12:50,459 --> 01:12:52,257
they's all alike.

659
01:12:54,505 --> 01:12:56,428
All of 'em is bastards.

660
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:17,486
Oh, that's beautiful!

661
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,993
I had a terrible time with the one I did.

662
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,207
Yeah, it looked like you did.

663
01:13:22,533 --> 01:13:24,456
I really appreciate it.

664
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:27,417
Can I get you something to eat?

665
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,127
Not here.

666
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,094
What do you mean, "Not here?"

667
01:13:37,006 --> 01:13:38,474
Well, uh...

668
01:13:39,926 --> 01:13:43,726
I figured you'd fix me
dinner at, uh, your place.

669
01:13:46,307 --> 01:13:47,900
No, I couldn't do that.

670
01:13:49,101 --> 01:13:51,524
Why not? You got a man?

671
01:13:52,104 --> 01:13:54,857
No. My husband died.

672
01:13:57,234 --> 01:13:58,970
What's your name?

673
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,323
- Pauline.
- Mine's Woody.

674
01:14:03,824 --> 01:14:05,518
How about next Sunday, in the afternoon?

675
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:07,812
Woody, I'm...
I'm not gonna fix you dinner.

676
01:14:07,912 --> 01:14:09,164
Why not?

677
01:14:10,873 --> 01:14:13,046
Because I just can't.

678
01:14:20,841 --> 01:14:22,034
Yeah.

679
01:14:22,134 --> 01:14:23,807
'Course you can't.

680
01:14:26,639 --> 01:14:28,332
I can't say that I blame you none.

681
01:14:28,432 --> 01:14:29,792
That's not the reason.

682
01:14:29,892 --> 01:14:32,236
Well, it's a pretty good reason.

683
01:14:33,062 --> 01:14:34,564
Listen, uh...

684
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:39,069
Give it a couple hours
before you handle it, okay?

685
01:14:42,738 --> 01:14:48,436
Way down in Columbus Stockade

686
01:14:48,536 --> 01:14:52,416
Want to come back to Tennessee

687
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:58,422
Way down in Columbus, Georgia

688
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:02,766
Wanna be back in Tennessee

689
01:15:04,552 --> 01:15:08,648
Go and leave me if you want to

690
01:15:09,765 --> 01:15:13,836
Never let me cross your mind

691
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:16,505
If in your heart

692
01:15:16,605 --> 01:15:20,051
You love another

693
01:15:20,151 --> 01:15:24,406
Leave little darling I don't mind

694
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:30,211
Thinkin' about my blue-eyed Sally

695
01:15:30,786 --> 01:15:34,632
Pretty little gal that I left behind

696
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:41,197
Way down in Columbus stockade

697
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:44,847
Wanna go back to Tennessee

698
01:15:46,302 --> 01:15:51,149
Way down in Columbus Georgia

699
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:56,586
Wanna be back in Tennessee

700
01:16:04,236 --> 01:16:05,513
It's Ozark.

701
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:06,764
Who's Ozark?

702
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:08,516
Ozark Bule, he sings on the radio.

703
01:16:08,616 --> 01:16:11,119
Sometimes he comes here to entertain us

704
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:20,903
Hey, how are you, sis?

705
01:16:21,003 --> 01:16:23,489
I swear, you get prettier every day.

706
01:16:23,589 --> 01:16:25,908
Hey, Jed, look over there
and see what I brought you guys.

707
01:16:26,008 --> 01:16:27,510
Open that door.

708
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,940
You get to eat it
without picking it for a change.

709
01:16:34,725 --> 01:16:36,419
Well, I can see just by looking at you

710
01:16:36,519 --> 01:16:38,942
that you haven't been doing
like I said and organizing.

711
01:16:39,105 --> 01:16:42,675
You're still letting those bosses stomp
all over you and pay you nothing

712
01:16:42,775 --> 01:16:45,428
for busting your behinds
in those fields all day.

713
01:16:45,528 --> 01:16:48,264
Now, the only way I'm gonna do
any singing here today,

714
01:16:48,364 --> 01:16:51,163
is if we all get together
and shout "Union," okay?

715
01:16:51,826 --> 01:16:54,750
Now, one, two, three...

716
01:16:54,954 --> 01:16:56,547
Union!

717
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,383
That was pitiful.

718
01:17:04,672 --> 01:17:07,616
Now, were gonna try it once more
and if more of you don't join in than that,

719
01:17:07,716 --> 01:17:09,744
I'm getting right back in this car
and I'm leaving.

720
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:10,870
No!

721
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:13,414
All right, all right, now,
we're gonna try it again.

722
01:17:13,514 --> 01:17:18,169
Now I wanna hear more of you joining in.
Now, one, two, three...

723
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:20,021
Union!

724
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:23,824
All right. Now it wasn't perfect,

725
01:17:25,568 --> 01:17:27,636
but I reckon it's a start.

726
01:17:27,736 --> 01:17:30,181
Okay, let's have a little picking
and singing, how about it?

727
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:32,079
Yeah!

728
01:17:35,703 --> 01:17:38,939
Long-haired preachers come out every night

729
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,485
Try to tell us what's wrong
and what's right

730
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:45,696
But when asked about something to eat

731
01:17:45,796 --> 01:17:48,866
They will answer in voices so sweet

732
01:17:48,966 --> 01:17:52,411
You're gonna eat by and by

733
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:55,956
When you learn how to cook and to fry

734
01:17:56,056 --> 01:17:59,293
Chop some wood, it'll do you good

735
01:17:59,393 --> 01:18:01,879
There'll be pie in the sky when you die

736
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:03,589
That's a lie!

737
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:06,509
In the starvation...

738
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:08,969
Hi, neighbors, come on over!

739
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:11,597
Come on over.
Now, I want you to listen to this verse.

740
01:18:11,697 --> 01:18:13,290
It makes sense.

741
01:18:16,577 --> 01:18:20,064
Working men of all countries unite

742
01:18:20,164 --> 01:18:23,692
Side by side for freedom we will ﬁght

743
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:27,196
When this world
and its wealth we have gained

744
01:18:27,296 --> 01:18:29,865
To the grafters we'll sing this refrain

745
01:18:29,965 --> 01:18:31,033
Everybody!

746
01:18:31,133 --> 01:18:34,537
You will eat, by and by

747
01:18:34,637 --> 01:18:37,998
In that glorious land above the sky

748
01:18:38,098 --> 01:18:41,544
Work and play, live on hay

749
01:18:41,644 --> 01:18:45,381
There'll be pie in the sky when you die

750
01:18:45,481 --> 01:18:47,154
That's a dirty lie!

751
01:18:51,153 --> 01:18:52,847
One more. One more.

752
01:18:52,947 --> 01:18:55,182
No, no, no, I'll tell you
something that's even better.

753
01:18:55,282 --> 01:18:57,143
Now, I want everybody here
that plays an instrument,

754
01:18:57,243 --> 01:18:58,602
now I know a lot of you do.

755
01:18:58,702 --> 01:19:01,063
I want you to go get that instrument
and come back here,

756
01:19:01,163 --> 01:19:05,225
and we're gonna have the damndest
hoe-down you've ever seen in your life.

757
01:19:12,174 --> 01:19:13,784
Round round Joe Clark

758
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:15,411
Round round I say

759
01:19:15,511 --> 01:19:17,121
Gonna walk ten thousand miles

760
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:19,394
To hear them ﬁddles play

761
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:40,561
Round round Joe Clark

762
01:19:40,661 --> 01:19:42,146
Round round I say

763
01:19:42,246 --> 01:19:44,106
I'm gonna walk ten thousand miles

764
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:45,649
To hear them ﬁddles play

765
01:19:45,749 --> 01:19:47,359
Round round Joe Clark

766
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:48,819
Round round I say

767
01:19:48,919 --> 01:19:50,654
I'm gonna walk ten thousand miles

768
01:19:50,754 --> 01:19:53,052
To hear them fiddles play

769
01:20:13,569 --> 01:20:16,618
The valley so low

770
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:23,917
Late in the evening

771
01:20:25,956 --> 01:20:28,550
Hear the wind blow

772
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:35,599
Hear the wind blow

773
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:41,100
Hear the wind blow

774
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:47,608
Late in the evening

775
01:20:50,022 --> 01:20:52,650
Hear the wind blow

776
01:20:56,070 --> 01:21:00,291
Roses love sunshine

777
01:21:01,909 --> 01:21:05,083
Violets love dew

778
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:12,382
Angels in heaven

779
01:21:13,754 --> 01:21:16,724
Know I love you

780
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:22,600
Write me a letter

781
01:21:25,474 --> 01:21:28,353
Send it by mail

782
01:21:29,269 --> 01:21:31,338
You people go back to your shacks.

783
01:21:31,438 --> 01:21:34,817
Send it in care of

784
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:39,993
The Birmingham jail

785
01:21:42,866 --> 01:21:46,461
The Birmingham jail

786
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:51,337
Birmingham jail

787
01:21:53,585 --> 01:21:56,805
Send it in care of

788
01:21:58,424 --> 01:22:01,910
So long, it's been good to know you

789
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:06,290
This dusty oil dust storm
is getting my goat

790
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:09,519
And I gotta be drifting along

791
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:13,731
Drifting along

792
01:22:17,234 --> 01:22:18,907
Real good. Real good.

793
01:22:20,195 --> 01:22:21,697
Oh, here.

794
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:24,641
This might help.

795
01:22:24,741 --> 01:22:26,368
It might at that.

796
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,050
This train's bound for glory this train

797
01:22:38,338 --> 01:22:41,968
This train's bound for glory this train

798
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:51,106
This train don't carry
no gamblers this train

799
01:22:52,394 --> 01:22:55,944
This train is bound for glory this train

800
01:22:57,024 --> 01:23:00,699
This train is bound for glory this train

801
01:23:01,445 --> 01:23:03,305
This train is bound for glory

802
01:23:03,405 --> 01:23:05,849
No one but the bold
but the righteous and the holy

803
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:09,419
This train is bound for glory this train

804
01:23:10,537 --> 01:23:14,483
This train don't carry no liars this train

805
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:18,445
This train don't carry no liars this train

806
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:20,656
This train don't carry no liars

807
01:23:20,756 --> 01:23:22,658
Or none of those midnight flyers

808
01:23:22,758 --> 01:23:25,978
This train is bound for glory this train

809
01:23:29,139 --> 01:23:31,938
This train don't carry
no con men this train

810
01:23:33,268 --> 01:23:36,505
This train don't carry
no con men this train

811
01:23:36,605 --> 01:23:38,924
Hey! This train don't carry no con men

812
01:23:39,024 --> 01:23:41,510
None of those wheeler dealers
here and gone men

813
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:44,489
This train is bound for glory this train

814
01:23:45,405 --> 01:23:49,205
This train is bound for glory this train

815
01:23:49,618 --> 01:23:53,564
This train is bound for glory this train

816
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:55,524
This train is bound for glory

817
01:23:55,624 --> 01:23:57,484
No one but the bold
but the righteous and the holy

818
01:23:57,584 --> 01:24:00,362
This train is bound for glory

819
01:24:00,462 --> 01:24:02,965
What the God damn hell
do you think you're doing'?

820
01:24:03,382 --> 01:24:05,534
This train don't carry no smokers

821
01:24:05,634 --> 01:24:07,636
What the hell does it look
like we're doing'?

822
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:11,019
I warned you to stay away from here, Bule.

823
01:24:12,224 --> 01:24:14,818
Yeah, well, I forgot.

824
01:24:16,395 --> 01:24:17,988
Get out of here.

825
01:24:23,652 --> 01:24:25,325
Okay, that's it!

826
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:33,562
Come on, get going!

827
01:24:33,662 --> 01:24:35,397
Get him out of here!

828
01:24:35,497 --> 01:24:37,170
Get in the car!

829
01:24:48,552 --> 01:24:51,205
Come on, let him get through!

830
01:24:51,305 --> 01:24:52,414
Get 'em off.

831
01:24:52,514 --> 01:24:54,187
Get 'em off that car.

832
01:24:59,271 --> 01:25:01,194
I'm gonna bust your head!

833
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:07,596
Union. Union. Union. Union.

834
01:25:07,696 --> 01:25:10,849
Union! Union! Union!

835
01:25:10,949 --> 01:25:13,748
Union! Union! Union!

836
01:25:14,911 --> 01:25:17,380
Union! Union!

837
01:25:28,925 --> 01:25:32,871
This sort of thing happen every time
you come out to entertain folks?

838
01:25:32,971 --> 01:25:34,540
Sure seems like it.

839
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:38,418
I figure as long as I'm getting those
goons riled up, I'm doin' my job.

840
01:25:38,518 --> 01:25:42,130
I'll tell you, those, uh,
boys don't seem to like you too much.

841
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,342
Yeah? Well, they didn't seem to
like you too much, either.

842
01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:47,365
I wasn't even trying.

843
01:25:47,944 --> 01:25:50,305
Maybe you ought to start.

844
01:25:50,405 --> 01:25:52,599
- Start what?
- Trying.

845
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:54,121
Trying what?

846
01:25:59,998 --> 01:26:02,751
You sure as hell don't look like much.

847
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,757
How do you sound?

848
01:26:05,879 --> 01:26:07,239
Makes me happy.

849
01:26:07,339 --> 01:26:09,637
Wait till you hear him, Mr. Locke.

850
01:26:10,759 --> 01:26:13,182
Okay, Guthrie, let's hear something.

851
01:26:14,638 --> 01:26:17,608
Okay, I'd like to sing a song about...

852
01:26:18,266 --> 01:26:21,486
Uh, Guthrie.
Let's just get on with it, please.

853
01:26:23,105 --> 01:26:26,508
...a place where I grew up.
It's called, uh,

854
01:26:26,608 --> 01:26:29,269
In Those Oklahoma Hills Where I Was Born.

855
01:26:34,116 --> 01:26:36,393
Many a month has come and gone

856
01:26:36,493 --> 01:26:38,645
Since I wandered from my home

857
01:26:38,745 --> 01:26:41,999
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born

858
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:45,944
Many a page of life was turned

859
01:26:46,044 --> 01:26:47,967
Many a lesson I have learned

860
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:52,260
And I feel like
in those hills I still belong

861
01:26:53,385 --> 01:26:55,787
Way down yonder on the Indian nation

862
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:57,956
Ridin' my pony on the reservation

863
01:26:58,056 --> 01:27:01,151
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born

864
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:05,005
Way down yonder on the Indian nation

865
01:27:05,105 --> 01:27:07,049
A cowboy's life is my occupation

866
01:27:07,149 --> 01:27:10,153
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born

867
01:27:12,154 --> 01:27:14,222
Well, as I stand here in LA

868
01:27:14,322 --> 01:27:15,682
Many a mile I am

869
01:27:15,782 --> 01:27:18,285
Okay, Guthrie, we'll give it a try.

870
01:27:18,535 --> 01:27:21,021
Pony through the draw

871
01:27:21,121 --> 01:27:22,064
Uh, Guthrie...

872
01:27:22,164 --> 01:27:23,982
Where the oaken blackjack trees

873
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:27,027
Kiss the playful prairie breeze

874
01:27:27,127 --> 01:27:30,097
Look, Woody, you have the job.

875
01:27:31,882 --> 01:27:34,117
Way down yonder on the Indian nation

876
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:36,328
Ridin' my pony on the reservation

877
01:27:36,428 --> 01:27:39,602
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born

878
01:27:41,475 --> 01:27:43,627
Way down yonder on the Indian nation

879
01:27:43,727 --> 01:27:45,837
A cowboy's life is my occupation

880
01:27:45,937 --> 01:27:49,174
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born

881
01:27:49,274 --> 01:27:51,026
Here's an advance, Guthrie.

882
01:27:53,111 --> 01:27:58,701
I want you to go and get a set
of decent clothes.

883
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:03,539
And show up here next Thursday!

884
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:06,041
At 20 bucks a week.

885
01:28:35,278 --> 01:28:38,515
Since I'm almost, uh,
half-way respectable now,

886
01:28:38,615 --> 01:28:40,600
maybe you could ask me
to your house for dinner.

887
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,644
That's not why I didn't ask you.

888
01:28:42,744 --> 01:28:44,312
Well, what is why?

889
01:28:44,412 --> 01:28:46,039
I don't know you.

890
01:28:46,748 --> 01:28:47,795
Well...

891
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:55,307
I think I'd like some chicken
with dressing.

892
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:18,038
So go to sleep my weary hobo

893
01:29:21,658 --> 01:29:25,913
Let the town drift slowly by

894
01:29:28,456 --> 01:29:34,134
And can't you hear the steel rails hummin'

895
01:29:37,716 --> 01:29:42,142
That's the hobo's lullaby

896
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:49,336
Folks, we got a real treat
for you tonight.

897
01:29:49,436 --> 01:29:53,840
We got an ol' boy from Oklahoma
who not only sings songs, he write 'em.

898
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:57,636
And, his name is Woodrow Wilson Guthrie,
but we just call him Woody.

899
01:29:57,736 --> 01:30:00,706
And his song is called,
I Ain't Got No Home.

900
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,274
Well, I ain't got no home

901
01:30:11,374 --> 01:30:13,860
I'm just ramblin' around

902
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,154
I'm a hard workin' ramblin' man

903
01:30:16,254 --> 01:30:18,907
And I go from town to town

904
01:30:19,007 --> 01:30:20,575
Police make it hard

905
01:30:20,675 --> 01:30:23,453
Hard everywhere I go

906
01:30:23,553 --> 01:30:25,455
And I ain't got no home

907
01:30:25,555 --> 01:30:27,978
In this world anymore

908
01:30:29,684 --> 01:30:31,419
I used to work for shares

909
01:30:31,519 --> 01:30:34,923
Seems like I was always poor

910
01:30:35,023 --> 01:30:38,802
Laid my crops right at the bankers door

911
01:30:38,902 --> 01:30:41,429
My wife took up and died

912
01:30:41,529 --> 01:30:43,390
On the cabin floor

913
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:46,164
And I ain't got no home

914
01:30:48,203 --> 01:30:50,877
And I ain't got no home

915
01:31:11,267 --> 01:31:12,377
Howdy, Ozark!

916
01:31:12,477 --> 01:31:14,354
Hi, neighbors!

917
01:31:16,815 --> 01:31:18,466
Can I talk to you for just a minute?

918
01:31:18,566 --> 01:31:19,885
Sure. Sure. Sure can.

919
01:31:19,985 --> 01:31:24,848
It seems to me, if I had to drag my tail home
with 75 or 80 cents in my pocket,

920
01:31:24,948 --> 01:31:26,474
after working all day like this,

921
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:29,394
I'd begin to wonder if something
maybe wasn't a little bit wrong.

922
01:31:29,494 --> 01:31:31,813
Maybe it'd be nice if you had enough money

923
01:31:31,913 --> 01:31:34,399
to put food on the table
at the end of the day.

924
01:31:34,499 --> 01:31:38,111
Well, did you ever stop to wonder
if maybe you couldn't do something

925
01:31:38,211 --> 01:31:41,781
about the way you live,
because you can, friends.

926
01:31:42,674 --> 01:31:43,971
Woody!

927
01:31:51,766 --> 01:31:54,002
Come on, I'm gonna get you!

928
01:31:54,102 --> 01:31:55,479
Get out!

929
01:31:59,649 --> 01:32:02,619
And move your bunch
and stay out of this valley!

930
01:32:06,281 --> 01:32:08,308
You people get back to work!

931
01:32:08,408 --> 01:32:10,536
Union! Union! Union!

932
01:32:15,081 --> 01:32:17,025
I been ridin' fast traveling

933
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:18,652
I thought you know'd

934
01:32:18,752 --> 01:32:20,570
I been ridin' in ﬂat wheelers

935
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:22,280
Way down the road

936
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,199
I been ridin' in blind passengers

937
01:32:24,299 --> 01:32:26,034
Dead enders kickin' up cinders

938
01:32:26,134 --> 01:32:28,978
I been havin' some hard travelin' Lord

939
01:32:33,308 --> 01:32:35,293
I been walkin' that Lincoln Highway

940
01:32:35,393 --> 01:32:36,962
I thought you know'd

941
01:32:37,062 --> 01:32:38,713
I been kickin' at sixty-six

942
01:32:38,813 --> 01:32:40,340
Away down the road

943
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,509
I got a heavy load, and a worried mind

944
01:32:42,609 --> 01:32:44,302
I'm lookin' for a woman that's hard to ﬁnd

945
01:32:44,402 --> 01:32:47,201
I been havin' some hard travelin' Lord

946
01:32:48,198 --> 01:32:49,349
Whoo!

947
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:52,419
All right! Give a big cheer here.

948
01:32:53,495 --> 01:32:55,714
Them farm workers need your help.

949
01:33:30,156 --> 01:33:31,891
I was expecting the Mayor.

950
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:34,744
Thought this was City Hall there,
for a second.

951
01:33:35,203 --> 01:33:36,955
Come on in, Woody.

952
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:40,942
How much you get paid for working
at that place, anyhow?

953
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:44,137
I don't get paid. I'm a volunteer.

954
01:33:48,883 --> 01:33:51,978
Excuse me, but, uh,
could I ask you a question?

955
01:33:55,014 --> 01:33:56,766
Sure. What?

956
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:01,734
Well, don't you get, uh,
embarrassed, ever?

957
01:34:03,773 --> 01:34:06,947
"Embarrassed ever?" About what?

958
01:34:09,154 --> 01:34:10,406
Well...

959
01:34:11,614 --> 01:34:15,539
Don't you get just a little bit embarrassed
about having so much,

960
01:34:16,286 --> 01:34:19,005
when so many people, uh, got nothing?

961
01:34:23,168 --> 01:34:26,172
Well, I don't think embarrassed.

962
01:34:27,213 --> 01:34:33,471
I am very sorry that there are
so many people who have nothing.

963
01:34:34,554 --> 01:34:35,931
Yeah, sure.

964
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:38,524
'Course you are.

965
01:34:43,104 --> 01:34:45,323
Sorry you don't get the hand.

966
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:49,949
So, you ladle them up with soup and, uh

967
01:34:50,403 --> 01:34:52,076
dish out a little charity.

968
01:34:53,031 --> 01:34:55,850
Well, Woody,
we're not all as gifted as you are.

969
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:59,329
Some of us just do the best we can.

970
01:35:01,372 --> 01:35:05,252
Pauline, uh,
let me tell you something, uh...

971
01:35:08,046 --> 01:35:11,971
Well, when I was on the road,
I met a lot of different kinds of people.

972
01:35:12,467 --> 01:35:15,161
Well, there is bums and freeloaders,

973
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:18,936
there's families
that was torn apart and...

974
01:35:20,433 --> 01:35:24,529
Poor people that just was aching
for some kind of work.

975
01:35:24,812 --> 01:35:27,715
And, men that are just
trying to get somewhere.

976
01:35:27,815 --> 01:35:29,237
Anywhere.

977
01:35:32,195 --> 01:35:34,618
They all got something in common,

978
01:35:35,323 --> 01:35:39,874
that, uh, every one of them
had something to give me.

979
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:44,107
And then you meet, uh,
some man that's got some money,

980
01:35:44,207 --> 01:35:48,929
and, uh, he'll be, uh,
tied up and anxious.

981
01:35:50,296 --> 01:35:52,323
The human thing is just gone!

982
01:35:52,423 --> 01:35:54,826
It's just gone, 'cause he's afraid.

983
01:35:54,926 --> 01:35:57,554
Afraid that he's gonna lose something.

984
01:35:58,137 --> 01:35:59,581
Why, he's afraid to smile

985
01:35:59,681 --> 01:36:03,126
'cause somebody's gonna come
and swipe his teeth outta his mouth.

986
01:36:03,226 --> 01:36:06,546
Woody, you don't really believe that
just because a person has money,

987
01:36:06,646 --> 01:36:09,149
that he completely loses touch.

988
01:36:09,857 --> 01:36:11,700
Because that's wrong.

989
01:36:12,527 --> 01:36:17,829
I feel as alive and human as anyone else.

990
01:36:22,495 --> 01:36:24,122
That don't give me nothing.

991
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:28,794
What the hell am I supposed
to give you, Woody?

992
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,929
Just why did you come here?

993
01:36:33,047 --> 01:36:35,675
I just like the way you looked,

994
01:36:39,262 --> 01:36:41,811
and I thought you had possibilities.

995
01:36:44,058 --> 01:36:45,685
Possibilities.

996
01:36:47,687 --> 01:36:50,031
Well, what must you think now?

997
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:53,861
Well, I think I'm lookin' at a

998
01:36:55,737 --> 01:36:56,909
rich person.

999
01:36:57,947 --> 01:36:59,073
So?

1000
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:03,253
So, you're the only one
that's ever looked back.

1001
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:09,755
You know Samson went out walkin'

1002
01:37:10,293 --> 01:37:14,844
And he slew a lion with his bare hands

1003
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:22,264
But it took a pretty woman

1004
01:37:23,598 --> 01:37:27,978
To show Samson he was just a lamb

1005
01:37:35,777 --> 01:37:37,887
Come on, Woody, we haven't got all day.

1006
01:37:37,987 --> 01:37:41,457
I have a reputation to uphold.

1007
01:37:41,741 --> 01:37:46,020
Well, I tell ya, if anybody catches us here,
they're gonna be a little bit angry at us.

1008
01:37:47,288 --> 01:37:50,087
It doesn't have to look
like Rembrandt, did it?

1009
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,403
Boy, I tell you, next time,
I'm painting the sign.

1010
01:37:53,503 --> 01:37:54,779
It ain't bad.

1011
01:37:54,879 --> 01:37:57,991
Well, there ain't no sense in doing it
all if somebody can't read it.

1012
01:37:58,091 --> 01:38:00,076
Might as well just go around
painting signs white.

1013
01:38:00,176 --> 01:38:01,703
I can see you never been caught.

1014
01:38:01,803 --> 01:38:04,539
Well, I wouldn't wanna be caught
by them guys out here,

1015
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,641
with a sign that looked as awful as that.

1016
01:38:06,849 --> 01:38:09,147
E-L-L.

1017
01:38:10,103 --> 01:38:11,963
I-E.

1018
01:38:12,063 --> 01:38:14,441
There we go. S.

1019
01:38:14,816 --> 01:38:17,218
Okay. "Come on and..."

1020
01:38:17,318 --> 01:38:19,721
You can read that. Come on, let's go.

1021
01:38:19,821 --> 01:38:22,557
Good evening, y'all, this is, uh,
Woody talking to you,

1022
01:38:22,657 --> 01:38:24,976
while Ozark's catching his breath.

1023
01:38:25,076 --> 01:38:28,730
I'd like to dedicate a song tonight
to all you folks

1024
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:31,925
sitting out there in fruit-picking camps.

1025
01:38:32,834 --> 01:38:35,462
Though you're squatting there hungry,

1026
01:38:35,837 --> 01:38:39,182
you're either too darned hot,
or too darned cold,

1027
01:38:40,216 --> 01:38:44,847
and, uh, wondering,
if you should've ever left home.

1028
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:48,775
Well, this here's for y'all.

1029
01:38:49,183 --> 01:38:50,918
If we don't organize,

1030
01:38:51,018 --> 01:38:52,879
if we don't unite in our struggle,

1031
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:55,590
those growers will have us
on our knees forever!

1032
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:58,134
- Well, what about a strike?
- Well, we gotta keep on working!

1033
01:38:58,234 --> 01:39:00,345
- We gotta strike!
- What about our families?

1034
01:39:00,445 --> 01:39:02,472
We have people working for us!

1035
01:39:02,572 --> 01:39:06,434
There are donations of food and clothing
coming from all over the state!

1036
01:39:06,534 --> 01:39:08,436
We don't want charity, we want jobs.

1037
01:39:08,536 --> 01:39:10,188
Listen. Listen to me.

1038
01:39:10,288 --> 01:39:14,400
There ain't nobody gonna get any damn jobs
until you start to listen to us.

1039
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,943
You're nothing but a bunch of Commies!

1040
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:17,111
- Right.
- Sit down!

1041
01:39:17,211 --> 01:39:18,237
- You sit down!
- No!

1042
01:39:18,337 --> 01:39:20,782
Hey, wait a minute.
Now is not the time to sit down!

1043
01:39:20,882 --> 01:39:22,784
Now is the time to stand up
for your rights!

1044
01:39:22,884 --> 01:39:24,327
Aw, sit down and shut up!

1045
01:39:24,427 --> 01:39:26,537
Listen to him!

1046
01:39:30,224 --> 01:39:32,126
We're telling you the truth!

1047
01:39:32,226 --> 01:39:34,729
Hold it, please! Hold it.

1048
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:38,775
Uh, just a tune about Free Red Range.

1049
01:39:40,067 --> 01:39:42,136
There once was a union maid

1050
01:39:42,236 --> 01:39:43,888
Who never was afraid

1051
01:39:43,988 --> 01:39:45,723
Of the goons and the ginks
and the company ﬁnks

1052
01:39:45,823 --> 01:39:47,767
And the deputy sheriffs
that made the raids

1053
01:39:47,867 --> 01:39:49,268
She went to the union hall

1054
01:39:49,368 --> 01:39:51,020
When a meetin' it was called

1055
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,980
And when the company boys came around

1056
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,482
She always stood her ground

1057
01:39:54,582 --> 01:39:56,067
Oh, you can't scare me

1058
01:39:56,167 --> 01:39:58,027
I'm stickin' to the union

1059
01:39:58,127 --> 01:39:59,946
I'm stickin' to the union

1060
01:40:00,046 --> 01:40:01,906
I'm stickin' to the union

1061
01:40:02,006 --> 01:40:03,574
Oh, you can't scare me

1062
01:40:03,674 --> 01:40:05,201
I'm stickin' to the union

1063
01:40:05,301 --> 01:40:07,036
I'm stickin' to the union

1064
01:40:07,136 --> 01:40:09,038
Until the day I die

1065
01:40:09,138 --> 01:40:10,915
Well, this union maid was wise

1066
01:40:11,015 --> 01:40:12,834
To the tricks of the company spies

1067
01:40:12,934 --> 01:40:14,585
She'd never gonna fool
by the company stool

1068
01:40:14,685 --> 01:40:16,421
She'd always organize the guys

1069
01:40:16,521 --> 01:40:18,131
She always got her way

1070
01:40:18,231 --> 01:40:19,841
When she'd ask for higher pay

1071
01:40:19,941 --> 01:40:21,676
She'd show her card to the National Guard

1072
01:40:21,776 --> 01:40:23,177
And this is what she'd say

1073
01:40:23,277 --> 01:40:24,762
Oh, you can't scare me

1074
01:40:24,862 --> 01:40:26,514
I'm stickin' to the union

1075
01:40:26,614 --> 01:40:28,182
I'm stickin' to the union

1076
01:40:28,282 --> 01:40:30,351
I'm stickin' to the union

1077
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:31,936
Oh, you can't scare me

1078
01:40:32,036 --> 01:40:33,771
I'm stickin' to the union

1079
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:35,273
I'm stickin' to the union

1080
01:40:35,373 --> 01:40:37,316
- Till the day I die
- Everybody!

1081
01:40:37,416 --> 01:40:39,068
Oh, you can't scare me

1082
01:40:39,168 --> 01:40:40,611
I'm stickin' to the union

1083
01:40:40,711 --> 01:40:42,196
I'm stickin' to the union

1084
01:40:42,296 --> 01:40:44,240
I'm stickin' to the union

1085
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,867
Oh, you can't scare me

1086
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:47,535
I'm stickin' to the union

1087
01:40:47,635 --> 01:40:49,328
I'm stickin' to the union

1088
01:40:49,428 --> 01:40:51,146
Till the day I die

1089
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:52,915
I told you. Outside!

1090
01:40:53,015 --> 01:40:55,359
- Get your hands off me.
- I said outside!

1091
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,153
Uh, excuse me.

1092
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:26,553
Did you ever think of becoming a painter?

1093
01:41:27,925 --> 01:41:33,352
I reckon I'd get busted up doing that,
just as easy as anything else.

1094
01:41:35,725 --> 01:41:37,693
I reckon you would.

1095
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:44,696
Woody.

1096
01:41:48,738 --> 01:41:50,411
- Woody!
- Uh-huh.

1097
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:54,247
I'm happy.

1098
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:58,748
I'm really happy that I know you.

1099
01:42:38,621 --> 01:42:39,998
Yeah.

1100
01:42:43,584 --> 01:42:45,177
Yeah, what?

1101
01:42:48,756 --> 01:42:50,099
Yeah,

1102
01:42:51,217 --> 01:42:52,844
I'm married.

1103
01:42:56,681 --> 01:43:00,026
I got a wife and I got kids.

1104
01:43:11,112 --> 01:43:14,015
I guess I could've lied to you before.

1105
01:43:14,115 --> 01:43:16,618
But I can't lie to you now.

1106
01:43:17,993 --> 01:43:19,836
Starting to care.

1107
01:43:27,628 --> 01:43:29,847
I was caring, too, Pauline.

1108
01:43:33,634 --> 01:43:36,228
Just being around you.

1109
01:43:38,723 --> 01:43:40,191
Knowing you.

1110
01:44:09,503 --> 01:44:12,222
Most of this mail is favorable, Woody.

1111
01:44:13,424 --> 01:44:16,052
Yes. Very favorable indeed.

1112
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:20,931
I didn't have no idea
that many people was listening.

1113
01:44:21,807 --> 01:44:23,935
Well, apparently they are.

1114
01:44:24,685 --> 01:44:27,380
Woody, I'm gonna give you and Memphis Sue

1115
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,091
your own half hour show to do every night!

1116
01:44:30,191 --> 01:44:32,254
How does that sound?

1117
01:44:35,362 --> 01:44:38,683
And, uh, of course,
that means more money, too.

1118
01:44:38,783 --> 01:44:40,831
Say, uh, 35 a week?

1119
01:44:41,702 --> 01:44:42,919
No.

1120
01:44:45,581 --> 01:44:47,049
However...

1121
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,251
However what?

1122
01:44:50,002 --> 01:44:54,573
However, uh,
you now have new sponsors, Woody,

1123
01:44:54,673 --> 01:45:00,225
and, uh, they've insisted that there be no
controversial material on their program.

1124
01:45:00,638 --> 01:45:03,124
So, just stick to the songs that have been

1125
01:45:03,224 --> 01:45:06,819
out and around for awhile
and everything" be fine.

1126
01:45:07,728 --> 01:45:12,258
Does that mean
I can't do my own songs on the show?

1127
01:45:12,358 --> 01:45:15,136
Of course, you can sing your own songs.

1128
01:45:15,236 --> 01:45:18,365
Long as it, uh,
doesn't get anybody riled up.

1129
01:45:18,697 --> 01:45:21,792
That sure sounds okay with me, Mr. Locke.

1130
01:45:23,077 --> 01:45:24,294
Uh...

1131
01:45:26,413 --> 01:45:27,881
Sure,

1132
01:45:28,207 --> 01:45:31,777
I guess it sounds A-okay with me, too.

1133
01:45:31,877 --> 01:45:35,882
Fine, then we'll, uh,
start on Monday, let's say?

1134
01:46:05,744 --> 01:46:07,271
Operator?

1135
01:46:07,371 --> 01:46:11,877
Yeah, I'd like to talk to Mary Guthrie,
in Pampa, Texas.

1136
01:46:12,835 --> 01:46:17,031
You'll have to get hold of a Mr. Jenkins
and, uh, he'll go and get her.

1137
01:46:17,131 --> 01:46:19,725
It's just so good to hear your voice.

1138
01:46:23,637 --> 01:46:27,416
Well, I'm gonna send you the money.
You just come on out here.

1139
01:46:27,516 --> 01:46:30,795
And I'll find you
a little house we can live in.

1140
01:46:30,895 --> 01:46:34,274
Oh, sure, honey,
just like you always talked about.

1141
01:46:36,817 --> 01:46:38,239
I love you, Mary.

1142
01:46:57,296 --> 01:47:00,220
Hey, Woody. Look at that.

1143
01:47:00,925 --> 01:47:03,410
- What is that?
- A field school.

1144
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:04,745
What do you think?

1145
01:47:04,845 --> 01:47:06,097
Sure.

1146
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:11,210
...the wonderful thing is you don't have to
know how to play one of 'em things.

1147
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:14,029
To make music, you just, uh, just sing.

1148
01:47:14,855 --> 01:47:18,551
You just go ahead
and sing any song you wanna sing.

1149
01:47:18,651 --> 01:47:22,576
You can make up a song
and just, uh, just sing it to yourself.

1150
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:25,850
You can just go ahead
and sing it out screaming loud.

1151
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:29,921
You can sing about your troubles
or you can sing about your happiness.

1152
01:47:30,913 --> 01:47:34,668
Sing about your teacher,
or you can sing about the crop duster.

1153
01:47:37,378 --> 01:47:39,551
There's singing in all of us.

1154
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:43,225
Just gotta learn to let it come on out.

1155
01:47:46,762 --> 01:47:49,164
Well, you stick out your little hand

1156
01:47:49,264 --> 01:47:51,542
To every woman kid and man

1157
01:47:51,642 --> 01:47:53,502
And you weave it up and down

1158
01:47:53,602 --> 01:47:55,713
Howdido, howdido

1159
01:47:55,813 --> 01:47:57,631
And you weave it up and down

1160
01:47:57,731 --> 01:47:59,800
Howdido

1161
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,844
I feel glad when you feel good

1162
01:48:01,944 --> 01:48:04,138
You brighten up my neighborhood

1163
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:05,806
With a dodi di dededi

1164
01:48:05,906 --> 01:48:08,142
Howdido, howdido

1165
01:48:08,242 --> 01:48:10,586
With a howdi howde hi, howdido

1166
01:48:14,581 --> 01:48:16,984
You have every right
to set down limits, Woody.

1167
01:48:17,084 --> 01:48:19,653
Now, he's not gonna allow
any preaching on your show.

1168
01:48:19,753 --> 01:48:21,300
I suppose you're right.

1169
01:48:22,256 --> 01:48:25,492
But they got a Sunday morning
gospel hour every night

1170
01:48:25,592 --> 01:48:26,827
and that fellow sure preaches.

1171
01:48:26,927 --> 01:48:28,954
That's what Locke's paying him to do.

1172
01:48:29,054 --> 01:48:31,273
He's paying you to entertain.

1173
01:48:32,224 --> 01:48:34,293
What would you do?

1174
01:48:34,393 --> 01:48:35,794
I'd do just like he said.

1175
01:48:35,894 --> 01:48:37,129
You would?

1176
01:48:37,229 --> 01:48:40,358
Because that's how I make my living.
That's how I eat.

1177
01:48:42,276 --> 01:48:44,845
It don't have nothing to do
with coming out to the fields

1178
01:48:44,945 --> 01:48:46,847
or doing the benefits or nothing.

1179
01:48:46,947 --> 01:48:49,516
You can separate it? Just like that?

1180
01:48:49,616 --> 01:48:52,165
I can separate it. Just like that.

1181
01:48:52,953 --> 01:48:58,108
Drop whatever you are doin'

1182
01:48:58,208 --> 01:49:01,362
Stop your work and worry too

1183
01:49:01,462 --> 01:49:04,323
Get right down and take it easy

1184
01:49:04,423 --> 01:49:07,723
Here come Woody and Memphis Sue

1185
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:13,666
You just drop off a letter

1186
01:49:13,766 --> 01:49:17,378
We will sing a song for you

1187
01:49:17,478 --> 01:49:20,631
Easy-going country people

1188
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:25,237
Plain ol' Woody and Memphis Sue

1189
01:49:28,614 --> 01:49:30,015
Good evening to you all.

1190
01:49:30,115 --> 01:49:32,685
Tonight Woody and I have got
30 minutes of your favorites

1191
01:49:32,785 --> 01:49:35,229
you've been dying to hear
and we're gonna start off

1192
01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:37,022
with Simmer on Spooning.

1193
01:49:37,122 --> 01:49:38,524
One, two...

1194
01:49:38,624 --> 01:49:41,252
I just decided to sing something else.

1195
01:49:44,004 --> 01:49:46,740
Well, lots of folks back east'd say

1196
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,243
Leavin' town most every day

1197
01:49:49,343 --> 01:49:51,328
Tryin' to beat their dusty way

1198
01:49:51,428 --> 01:49:54,540
To the California line

1199
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,167
Well, across the desert sands they roll

1200
01:49:57,267 --> 01:49:59,753
Tryin' to get outta that ol' dust bowl

1201
01:49:59,853 --> 01:50:01,922
And they think they're
headin' for a sugar bowl

1202
01:50:02,022 --> 01:50:04,299
Here is what they ﬁnd

1203
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:08,199
'Cause the police at the port of entry say

1204
01:50:08,737 --> 01:50:12,492
You're number fourteen thousand for today

1205
01:50:13,325 --> 01:50:17,375
And if you ain't got the do-re-mi boy

1206
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:21,775
You ain't got the do-re-mi

1207
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:25,654
You better go back home to beautiful Texas

1208
01:50:25,754 --> 01:50:28,115
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas

1209
01:50:28,215 --> 01:50:30,200
Tennessee, South of the border

1210
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:33,975
California is the Garden of Eden

1211
01:50:35,013 --> 01:50:38,876
The paradise to live in or to see

1212
01:50:38,976 --> 01:50:40,961
But believe it or not

1213
01:50:41,061 --> 01:50:43,172
You won't ﬁnd it's so hot

1214
01:50:43,272 --> 01:50:45,382
If you ain't got the do-re-mi

1215
01:50:45,482 --> 01:50:47,217
A lost cause, you mean.

1216
01:50:47,317 --> 01:50:50,170
And he is ticked off.

1217
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:52,598
Well, I expected that.

1218
01:50:52,698 --> 01:50:55,976
Yeah, well, he said that from now on
you have to make a list

1219
01:50:56,076 --> 01:50:58,920
each week of all the songs
you plan on singing.

1220
01:51:00,414 --> 01:51:03,509
Well, he might as well fire me then,
'cause I ain't making no list.

1221
01:51:03,917 --> 01:51:06,653
Dammit, Woody, don't you go
and mess up this job.

1222
01:51:06,753 --> 01:51:09,323
Now, God knows what's gonna
happen to you, if you get can...

1223
01:51:09,423 --> 01:51:13,077
Will you stop splashing when I'm trying
to talk to you, for God's sake?

1224
01:51:13,177 --> 01:51:16,431
Now, you stop it, too!
Now, dammit, that ain't funny! Stop it!

1225
01:51:33,655 --> 01:51:35,015
Ain't it something?

1226
01:51:35,115 --> 01:51:37,851
Oh, this city, it's something.

1227
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:39,520
You've only seen a bit of it, Mary.

1228
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:41,814
Hey, Woody, you know what we ought to do?

1229
01:51:41,914 --> 01:51:45,400
Let's get a picnic basket together
and take the girls down to the beach.

1230
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,653
Well, that'd be some time else.

1231
01:51:47,753 --> 01:51:53,367
Me and Mary ain't, uh, seen each other
for few months. Understand?

1232
01:51:53,467 --> 01:51:56,328
Right. Hey, listen,
you need some help with those?

1233
01:51:56,428 --> 01:51:58,330
Oh, I can handle it okay.

1234
01:51:58,430 --> 01:51:59,790
Thanks for the ride, Ozark.

1235
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,667
You bet.

1236
01:52:01,767 --> 01:52:04,395
Hey, honey, let me show you the inside.

1237
01:52:06,855 --> 01:52:08,323
Look at this.

1238
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:13,661
Huh?

1239
01:52:15,197 --> 01:52:16,494
Oh!

1240
01:52:20,118 --> 01:52:22,496
Come here, let me show you this.

1241
01:52:25,666 --> 01:52:28,545
- Electric, huh?
- Oh, a refrigerator!

1242
01:52:34,675 --> 01:52:36,201
Let me show you the bedroom.

1243
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:39,680
Oh, I ain't finished looking
at the kitchen yet, Woody.

1244
01:52:43,684 --> 01:52:45,482
Oh, my God!

1245
01:52:46,937 --> 01:52:48,689
Our own bedroom.

1246
01:53:01,076 --> 01:53:02,202
Oh!

1247
01:53:02,953 --> 01:53:04,546
Oh, this pin.

1248
01:53:15,465 --> 01:53:18,685
It's so pretty, Woody. It's so perfect.

1249
01:53:20,554 --> 01:53:23,123
To celebrate say wooiee!

1250
01:53:23,223 --> 01:53:24,625
- No!
- Go ahead.

1251
01:53:24,725 --> 01:53:26,793
- I don't have to.
- Why not? Go ahead and do it.

1252
01:53:26,893 --> 01:53:28,420
- No.
- Go ahead.

1253
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,272
Or I'll tickle you.

1254
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,258
All right. Wooiee!

1255
01:53:33,358 --> 01:53:36,305
What's the matter?
Ain't you ticklish no more?

1256
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:40,624
Come on. Do it again, come on.

1257
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:43,418
Okay!

1258
01:53:44,411 --> 01:53:46,355
Wooiee!

1259
01:53:46,455 --> 01:53:48,753
Wooiee!

1260
01:53:52,753 --> 01:53:54,988
Hey, we have wet shoes.

1261
01:53:55,088 --> 01:53:56,431
Yeah!

1262
01:54:05,932 --> 01:54:07,542
I think I sounded awful.

1263
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:09,044
Oh, you were great, Sue.

1264
01:54:09,144 --> 01:54:11,129
- I wasn't great.
- You were.

1265
01:54:11,229 --> 01:54:14,174
Mr. Guthrie, excuse me, my name's Baker.
You don't know me.

1266
01:54:14,274 --> 01:54:17,052
I'm an agent and, uh, I know that you're
working here without a contract.

1267
01:54:17,152 --> 01:54:19,554
Now, if you would be willing
to travel a bit,

1268
01:54:19,654 --> 01:54:23,058
I think I could double, maybe triple
what you're earning right now.

1269
01:54:23,158 --> 01:54:24,810
How would you do that?

1270
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:27,521
Well, better shows, for one thing.

1271
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:31,149
Mr. Guthrie, I think that I could wangle
you a coast to coast broadcast.

1272
01:54:31,249 --> 01:54:35,629
I mean, I know a lot of important people
that I would like to talk to about you.

1273
01:54:36,421 --> 01:54:38,469
Well, I'll think it over.

1274
01:54:39,132 --> 01:54:41,660
Well, okay. I mean,
I don't wanna press you.

1275
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,328
Why don't I come back when we can talk

1276
01:54:43,428 --> 01:54:45,772
when I've got something
in the works for you?

1277
01:54:47,015 --> 01:54:48,358
Sure.

1278
01:54:48,809 --> 01:54:52,546
Mr. Guthrie, you're gonna be
on your way before you know it.

1279
01:54:52,646 --> 01:54:53,964
- Hello, Baker.
- Hello.

1280
01:54:54,064 --> 01:54:57,318
Woody, uh, just a minute, please,
I wanna talk to you.

1281
01:54:59,152 --> 01:55:03,328
Uh... I haven't seen any list yet.

1282
01:55:03,657 --> 01:55:04,891
List?

1283
01:55:04,991 --> 01:55:09,354
Yes, you know, the, uh, list of songs
that you're scheduled to do next week.

1284
01:55:09,454 --> 01:55:13,358
Well, yeah, I ain't, uh, wrote it yet.

1285
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:15,819
Well, uh, I need, I need the list, Woody.

1286
01:55:15,919 --> 01:55:18,547
Because the, uh,
the sponsors are insist...

1287
01:55:29,558 --> 01:55:31,435
What the hell is that?

1288
01:55:33,186 --> 01:55:34,654
It's an artichoke.

1289
01:55:35,522 --> 01:55:36,944
An artichoke.

1290
01:55:39,317 --> 01:55:40,660
What do you do with it?

1291
01:55:42,863 --> 01:55:44,581
You eat it.

1292
01:55:47,284 --> 01:55:49,332
Damndest thing I ever seen.

1293
01:55:50,454 --> 01:55:53,879
Don't look too appetizing, do it?

1294
01:55:54,166 --> 01:55:57,069
I gets paid to pick 'em, not to eat 'em.

1295
01:55:57,169 --> 01:55:58,842
I guess you are.

1296
01:55:59,171 --> 01:56:03,742
Bet they don't pay you much for picking
them ugly old things, either, do they?

1297
01:56:03,842 --> 01:56:05,014
I don't get much.

1298
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:08,059
Did you ever think about all that stooping

1299
01:56:08,472 --> 01:56:11,726
for just pennies?

1300
01:56:16,855 --> 01:56:19,074
You one of those union men?

1301
01:56:19,399 --> 01:56:22,573
You, uh, you one of those fellas
talking about strike?

1302
01:56:24,196 --> 01:56:27,040
I talk about whatever it is that works.

1303
01:56:29,117 --> 01:56:31,495
I got no time to talk to you, mister!

1304
01:56:36,333 --> 01:56:38,068
We died 'neath your trees

1305
01:56:38,168 --> 01:56:40,921
And we died in your bushes

1306
01:56:41,296 --> 01:56:43,698
Both sides of the river

1307
01:56:43,798 --> 01:56:46,096
We died just the same

1308
01:56:48,053 --> 01:56:49,746
Is this the best way

1309
01:56:49,846 --> 01:56:52,269
We can grow our big orchards?

1310
01:56:53,475 --> 01:56:55,001
Is this the best way

1311
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:57,729
We can grow our good fruit?

1312
01:56:59,397 --> 01:57:00,924
Oh, our dry leaves

1313
01:57:01,024 --> 01:57:03,026
That rot on my topsoil

1314
01:57:04,236 --> 01:57:08,014
And to be called by no name except

1315
01:57:08,114 --> 01:57:10,434
Deportees

1316
01:57:10,534 --> 01:57:12,602
Goodbye my Juan

1317
01:57:12,702 --> 01:57:15,522
Goodbye Rosalita

1318
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:20,735
Jesus y Maria

1319
01:57:20,835 --> 01:57:22,946
You won't have your names

1320
01:57:23,046 --> 01:57:26,324
When you ride the big airplane

1321
01:57:26,424 --> 01:57:29,703
All they will call you will be

1322
01:57:29,803 --> 01:57:31,726
Deportees

1323
01:57:33,139 --> 01:57:36,960
Oklahoma, Texas ain't nothing
compared to California.

1324
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:40,964
Now that don't seem right somehow,
it being so pretty out here and all.

1325
01:57:41,064 --> 01:57:43,533
No, it ain't right.

1326
01:57:45,026 --> 01:57:46,403
Not at all.

1327
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:51,266
Does seem like it was easier
to put up with

1328
01:57:51,366 --> 01:57:53,935
nature and dust storms and all

1329
01:57:54,035 --> 01:57:56,379
than it is to put up with greed.

1330
01:57:58,832 --> 01:58:00,334
Yeah, I guess so.

1331
01:58:03,837 --> 01:58:07,341
Did you, uh,
did you ever make that list for Mr. Locke?

1332
01:58:09,467 --> 01:58:12,266
No, I didn't. Not yet.

1333
01:58:13,847 --> 01:58:15,815
Don't he want it right away?

1334
01:58:16,016 --> 01:58:17,689
I suppose he does.

1335
01:58:21,896 --> 01:58:25,867
It ain't that easy for me to do.
Make up a list.

1336
01:58:26,234 --> 01:58:28,032
No, I guess not.

1337
01:58:31,823 --> 01:58:34,768
I was cleaning yesterday, Woody,

1338
01:58:34,868 --> 01:58:38,918
this old man,
he must've been 70 years old.

1339
01:58:39,205 --> 01:58:41,566
He didn't have no teeth,

1340
01:58:41,666 --> 01:58:44,010
he wasn't wearing no shoes.

1341
01:58:44,794 --> 01:58:47,388
He came to the door begging for food.

1342
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:51,218
I gave him some fried chicken.

1343
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:53,887
He was wrinkled.

1344
01:58:55,263 --> 01:58:57,857
Wrinkled ol' face, just lit right up.

1345
01:58:59,601 --> 01:59:01,945
Then I started in worrying about us.

1346
01:59:02,103 --> 01:59:04,130
I got real worried, Woody.

1347
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:09,803
Asking myself, "My God, are we gonna be
like that again, two weeks from now?"

1348
01:59:09,903 --> 01:59:12,873
I can't help thinking
about those bad times.

1349
01:59:13,657 --> 01:59:16,126
I don't want 'em to happen again.

1350
01:59:52,112 --> 01:59:53,513
Woody?

1351
01:59:53,613 --> 01:59:55,348
It's me, Johnson.

1352
01:59:55,448 --> 01:59:57,325
Hey, it sure is.

1353
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,937
What the hell happened to you?

1354
02:00:01,037 --> 02:00:04,107
Oh, uh, we had some trouble out there.

1355
02:00:04,207 --> 02:00:06,776
Them, uh, owners has sent the men charging

1356
02:00:06,876 --> 02:00:09,504
into a picket line that we had set up.

1357
02:00:10,213 --> 02:00:13,808
And they're swinging their clubs
in every direction, just...

1358
02:00:15,635 --> 02:00:16,761
Just got me.

1359
02:00:19,264 --> 02:00:20,582
Did that to you, huh?

1360
02:00:20,682 --> 02:00:22,042
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1361
02:00:22,142 --> 02:00:24,361
There were some others, I'm afraid.

1362
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:28,048
What about your family? They okay?

1363
02:00:28,148 --> 02:00:29,821
Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

1364
02:00:30,316 --> 02:00:35,447
Fact is, uh, I been learning
an awful lot from that baby 0' mine.

1365
02:00:36,823 --> 02:00:38,391
Been learning, have ya?

1366
02:00:38,491 --> 02:00:39,663
Yeah.

1367
02:00:40,368 --> 02:00:42,496
Yeah, I been learning that

1368
02:00:42,912 --> 02:00:46,816
when that baby wants something,
she's gonna cry,

1369
02:00:46,916 --> 02:00:51,012
and carry on something awful
till she gets what she's after.

1370
02:00:52,839 --> 02:00:55,408
Then I started thinking about

1371
02:00:55,508 --> 02:00:58,244
all those thousands of people,

1372
02:00:58,344 --> 02:01:00,767
working out there in the fields.

1373
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:04,393
Never getting nothing they want.

1374
02:01:04,851 --> 02:01:07,070
Just giving up.

1375
02:01:07,687 --> 02:01:09,530
Never saying nothing.

1376
02:01:12,567 --> 02:01:15,161
I don't wanna wind up like that, Woody.

1377
02:01:16,529 --> 02:01:20,204
I don't wanna end up just sitting around.

1378
02:01:23,453 --> 02:01:26,878
So, I made up my mind
that I'm just gonna speak out.

1379
02:01:28,291 --> 02:01:30,293
Just like that baby of mine.

1380
02:01:32,504 --> 02:01:34,802
I'm gonna let folks know what I want.

1381
02:01:39,135 --> 02:01:41,479
Well, what's Liz think about all this?

1382
02:01:42,013 --> 02:01:45,608
Well, she's plenty scared.
You know how women are.

1383
02:01:46,059 --> 02:01:48,128
She says she's proud of me.

1384
02:01:48,228 --> 02:01:49,821
I bet she is.

1385
02:01:51,022 --> 02:01:52,365
Yeah.

1386
02:01:53,441 --> 02:01:56,741
Anyway, Woody, what I come to tell you

1387
02:01:59,197 --> 02:02:03,043
is keep up your music,
'cause everybody's listening.

1388
02:02:04,577 --> 02:02:05,920
Well...

1389
02:02:08,456 --> 02:02:10,754
Keep on doing the work, huh?

1390
02:02:20,343 --> 02:02:24,018
Woody. I want the list.
And I want it right now.

1391
02:02:30,436 --> 02:02:33,465
Ah, that wasn't so...
Woody, just a minute, please.

1392
02:02:33,565 --> 02:02:35,784
It wasn't so painful, was it?

1393
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:42,098
"Bury Me Beneath the Willow.

1394
02:02:42,198 --> 02:02:43,950
"Sweet Pearl.

1395
02:02:44,993 --> 02:02:46,811
"Long Green Valley", what is that?

1396
02:02:46,911 --> 02:02:50,190
That's not about the San Fernando Valley,

1397
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:52,275
or pickers, or orchards,
or anything like that is it?

1398
02:02:52,375 --> 02:02:55,904
It's about a man that killed his sweetheart,
'cause she's sleeping around on him.

1399
02:02:56,004 --> 02:02:57,363
Oh, good.

1400
02:02:57,463 --> 02:02:58,865
Least he thinks she was.

1401
02:02:58,965 --> 02:03:02,410
Well, that's good.
Yeah, these are fine, Woody.

1402
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:03,978
Fine, thank you.

1403
02:04:03,905 --> 02:04:06,599
It's a mighty hard road

1404
02:04:06,699 --> 02:04:09,873
That these poor hands have hoed

1405
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:15,275
My poor feet have traveled

1406
02:04:15,375 --> 02:04:17,673
A hot dusty road

1407
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,866
From out of the old dust bowl

1408
02:04:22,966 --> 02:04:25,034
And westward we rolled

1409
02:04:25,134 --> 02:04:27,662
And your desert was hot

1410
02:04:27,762 --> 02:04:32,017
And your mountains were cold

1411
02:04:35,645 --> 02:04:38,047
Green pastures of plenty

1412
02:04:38,147 --> 02:04:40,650
From high desert ground

1413
02:04:42,735 --> 02:04:45,138
From the Grand Coulee Dam

1414
02:04:45,238 --> 02:04:47,957
Where the water runs down

1415
02:04:51,619 --> 02:04:53,605
This land I'll defend

1416
02:04:53,705 --> 02:04:56,208
With my life if need be

1417
02:04:57,291 --> 02:04:59,611
'Cause these pastures of plenty

1418
02:04:59,711 --> 02:05:01,839
Must always

1419
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:06,308
Be free

1420
02:05:21,941 --> 02:05:25,511
Look on them deserts

1421
02:05:25,611 --> 02:05:27,579
All around me

1422
02:05:33,369 --> 02:05:35,121
You and me

1423
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:39,008
This land

1424
02:05:49,177 --> 02:05:52,956
There's a better world a-comin',
tell you why

1425
02:05:53,056 --> 02:05:56,876
There's a better world a-comin',
tell you why

1426
02:05:56,976 --> 02:06:00,838
There's a better world a-comin', by and by

1427
02:06:00,938 --> 02:06:02,799
There's a better world a-comin'

1428
02:06:02,899 --> 02:06:04,842
Can't you see? Can't you see?

1429
02:06:04,942 --> 02:06:06,678
There's a better world a-comin'

1430
02:06:06,778 --> 02:06:08,451
Can't you see?

1431
02:06:08,654 --> 02:06:12,392
When we'll all be union
and we'll all be free

1432
02:06:12,492 --> 02:06:14,227
There's a better world a-comin'

1433
02:06:14,327 --> 02:06:15,874
Can't you see?

1434
02:06:16,204 --> 02:06:18,147
I'm a union man

1435
02:06:18,247 --> 02:06:19,941
In a union war

1436
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:23,215
It's a union world I'm ﬁghtin' for

1437
02:06:24,212 --> 02:06:26,948
'Cause there's a better world a-comin',
tell you why

1438
02:06:27,048 --> 02:06:28,324
Tell you why

1439
02:06:28,424 --> 02:06:31,911
There's a better world a-comin',
tell you why

1440
02:06:32,011 --> 02:06:33,955
Through the marchin' and the battlin'

1441
02:06:34,055 --> 02:06:35,790
You can see the chains a rattlin'

1442
02:06:35,890 --> 02:06:37,083
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1443
02:06:37,183 --> 02:06:38,167
Get outta here, boy.

1444
02:06:38,267 --> 02:06:41,212
I'll get out when I'm good and ready, and I
ain't good and ready, just yet.

1445
02:06:41,312 --> 02:06:42,655
Yes, you are!

1446
02:06:47,026 --> 02:06:48,403
John, hold him!

1447
02:07:30,153 --> 02:07:33,014
I just been on the bum
for the last few months.

1448
02:07:33,114 --> 02:07:35,475
Figured now, I'll go to LA and stay there.

1449
02:07:35,575 --> 02:07:37,351
Where you from?

1450
02:07:37,451 --> 02:07:41,581
Shit, I think I was born in an orange
grove somewheres, I don't know.

1451
02:07:43,791 --> 02:07:45,777
Do your folks know where you are?

1452
02:07:45,877 --> 02:07:47,820
Unless they lined everyone up
and count heads,

1453
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,922
they wouldn't even know I was missing.

1454
02:08:06,439 --> 02:08:07,715
Daddy!

1455
02:08:07,815 --> 02:08:09,692
- Hey, Snooks!
- Hi, Dad!

1456
02:08:13,112 --> 02:08:15,456
Hey! Give me a kiss.

1457
02:08:15,948 --> 02:08:17,746
Daddy!

1458
02:08:18,618 --> 02:08:20,228
What're you doing here, anyway, huh?

1459
02:08:20,328 --> 02:08:23,773
And the boy scolded us
and their mothers and fathers

1460
02:08:23,873 --> 02:08:25,525
and their sisters pull 'em up.

1461
02:08:25,625 --> 02:08:29,362
Yeah, what he might do, I think,
and but we'll eat 'em for dinner.

1462
02:08:29,462 --> 02:08:30,463
Sure.

1463
02:08:31,964 --> 02:08:33,637
Guess who's home?

1464
02:08:36,802 --> 02:08:38,304
Hi, honey.

1465
02:08:40,681 --> 02:08:42,250
Where have you been?

1466
02:08:42,350 --> 02:08:44,193
Oh, I just had to

1467
02:08:45,811 --> 02:08:49,031
touch the people for a little bit, honey.

1468
02:08:51,025 --> 02:08:52,868
Well, darn it, Woody.

1469
02:08:53,986 --> 02:08:57,390
While you been out fighting again,

1470
02:08:57,490 --> 02:09:00,059
you may have just lost that job.

1471
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:03,312
Mr. Locke's been calling every day
and he's real upset.

1472
02:09:03,412 --> 02:09:06,732
And that agent fellow's been calling,
and he's mad.

1473
02:09:06,832 --> 02:09:08,109
AW, the hell with them.

1474
02:09:08,209 --> 02:09:11,946
Well, you can't say that.
You just can't say that.

1475
02:09:12,046 --> 02:09:14,949
Mr. Locke is paying you better money
than you ever got before.

1476
02:09:15,049 --> 02:09:17,743
You can't say the hell with all that.

1477
02:09:17,843 --> 02:09:19,720
That don't mean nothing.

1478
02:09:22,139 --> 02:09:24,517
Well, if it don't, what does?

1479
02:09:25,935 --> 02:09:28,671
I know it ain't me and the kids.

1480
02:09:28,771 --> 02:09:33,072
You don't think nothing about running
off whenever you get the urge.

1481
02:09:33,317 --> 02:09:34,694
Oh, Mary...

1482
02:09:35,945 --> 02:09:37,868
Don't even talk like that.

1483
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:44,020
Now, I truly care about
you and the kids. I truly care.

1484
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,355
Well, that sure ain't the way it seems!

1485
02:09:46,455 --> 02:09:49,942
You're spending your whole life out there,
trying to fix the world!

1486
02:09:50,042 --> 02:09:52,528
You're not doing nothing
to help our family!

1487
02:09:52,628 --> 02:09:56,532
Hell! I brought you out here
to California, didn't I?

1488
02:09:56,632 --> 02:09:58,826
And then you left!

1489
02:09:58,926 --> 02:10:01,099
Hell, Mary, it's just that I

1490
02:10:02,054 --> 02:10:03,789
can't seem to...

1491
02:10:03,889 --> 02:10:05,625
I just can't stand to sit still.

1492
02:10:05,725 --> 02:10:08,899
I always feel like
I ought to be somewheres else.

1493
02:10:09,228 --> 02:10:10,838
Anywheres else!

1494
02:10:10,938 --> 02:10:14,408
What about me? What am I supposed to do?

1495
02:10:15,192 --> 02:10:17,428
Sit and wait,

1496
02:10:17,528 --> 02:10:20,389
while you are off gallivanting
around the country?

1497
02:10:20,489 --> 02:10:22,141
Am I?

1498
02:10:22,241 --> 02:10:24,494
Am I supposed to just sit

1499
02:10:25,077 --> 02:10:27,647
and worry if the kids
are gonna have a daddy?

1500
02:10:27,747 --> 02:10:30,942
'Cause maybe you got your head bashed in.

1501
02:10:31,042 --> 02:10:32,318
Am I?

1502
02:10:32,418 --> 02:10:35,321
Am I supposed to sit home and pray to God

1503
02:10:35,421 --> 02:10:38,616
my husband ain't wandering around
somewheres bleeding to death?

1504
02:10:38,716 --> 02:10:41,994
Keep going like this, Woody, and our
family's gonna be down on our knees,

1505
02:10:42,094 --> 02:10:43,371
begging them growers for a day's work!

1506
02:10:43,471 --> 02:10:45,498
- Dammit, woman...
- We're gonna be on our knees begging!

1507
02:10:45,598 --> 02:10:46,666
Stop your talking, will ya?

1508
02:10:46,766 --> 02:10:48,834
Well, shutting me up,
isn't gonna make anything better!

1509
02:10:48,934 --> 02:10:50,211
I said stop talking!

1510
02:10:50,311 --> 02:10:51,921
I ain't through!

1511
02:10:52,021 --> 02:10:54,966
Just one more word now,
just one more word!

1512
02:10:55,066 --> 02:10:57,343
Are you sure you haven't got
something else on your mind?

1513
02:10:57,443 --> 02:10:58,594
You positive?

1514
02:11:01,489 --> 02:11:02,661
Aw...

1515
02:11:04,033 --> 02:11:06,161
- Mary...
- Don't!

1516
02:11:32,103 --> 02:11:35,131
And so help me,
if anyone else had walked out on me

1517
02:11:35,231 --> 02:11:37,591
without a word,
they'd be out on the street!

1518
02:11:37,691 --> 02:11:40,386
Stop fussing, I'm gonna give you
one more chance, just one.

1519
02:11:40,486 --> 02:11:42,909
But, I want you to be responsible
and stick to the songs...

1520
02:11:43,322 --> 02:11:45,891
No, I won't take off my buckskin gloves

1521
02:11:45,991 --> 02:11:48,352
They're made of Spanish leather

1522
02:11:48,452 --> 02:11:51,063
I'll go my way from day to day

1523
02:11:51,163 --> 02:11:53,524
And sing with the Gypsy Davy

1524
02:11:53,624 --> 02:11:55,985
And sing it with the Gypsy Davy

1525
02:11:56,085 --> 02:11:58,404
That song with the Gypsy Davy

1526
02:11:58,504 --> 02:12:02,600
And lovin'

1527
02:12:03,342 --> 02:12:06,346
That Gypsy Davy

1528
02:12:12,226 --> 02:12:14,628
I'd like to dedicate this next song

1529
02:12:14,728 --> 02:12:16,756
to all you pickers out there,

1530
02:12:16,856 --> 02:12:20,030
with your hearts aching
and your bellies growling.

1531
02:12:20,568 --> 02:12:24,513
And, I'd like you to remember that
if you feel like singing along with me,

1532
02:12:24,613 --> 02:12:26,724
and you don't know all the words,

1533
02:12:26,824 --> 02:12:30,227
just go ahead and make up
some of your own.

1534
02:12:30,327 --> 02:12:34,048
I'm sure you all got plenty to say
about the way things are.

1535
02:12:34,290 --> 02:12:37,276
You continually force me
to treat you like a child!

1536
02:12:37,376 --> 02:12:39,779
Now, what do I have to say
to get through to you?

1537
02:12:39,879 --> 02:12:42,348
You can tell me you don't like my singing.

1538
02:12:43,632 --> 02:12:45,451
That is not up to me, Woody.

1539
02:12:45,551 --> 02:12:47,995
There are sponsors.
Now, if it were up to me...

1540
02:12:48,095 --> 02:12:50,289
Do you like me singing?

1541
02:12:50,389 --> 02:12:51,832
But, that isn't the point!

1542
02:12:51,932 --> 02:12:54,543
I'm tryin' to tell you something.
There are sponsors.

1543
02:12:54,643 --> 02:12:57,463
They pay for the right to hear
what they wanna hear.

1544
02:12:57,563 --> 02:13:00,032
Maybe you like some of my singing
but not all of my singing.

1545
02:13:00,191 --> 02:13:03,411
Woody, please! Just listen to me.

1546
02:13:03,527 --> 02:13:06,013
Now they feel
that that kind of material...

1547
02:13:06,113 --> 02:13:07,973
I like my singing too much

1548
02:13:08,073 --> 02:13:11,748
to take orders from some fat little squirt
doesn't even know his own mind.

1549
02:13:13,537 --> 02:13:16,816
Well, then there's not much
to discuss, is there?

1550
02:13:16,916 --> 02:13:19,777
You want the job,
or do you not want the job?

1551
02:13:19,877 --> 02:13:21,821
Do you think I can't replace you?

1552
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:23,864
In ten minutes? In five minutes?

1553
02:13:23,964 --> 02:13:26,784
I don't need this place.
I can sing on the street if I feel like.

1554
02:13:26,884 --> 02:13:29,245
Well, get the hell out of my office!

1555
02:13:29,345 --> 02:13:30,579
I don't need you.

1556
02:13:30,679 --> 02:13:32,602
I can sing while I'm walking.

1557
02:13:41,232 --> 02:13:42,449
Woody!

1558
02:13:43,526 --> 02:13:45,469
- What the hell you up to?
- Leave me go, Ozark.

1559
02:13:45,569 --> 02:13:47,738
I ain't in no mood for talking.

1560
02:13:48,288 --> 02:13:51,517
- You got your butt fired, didn't you?
- Damn right, I did.

1561
02:13:51,617 --> 02:13:52,768
What'd he tell you?

1562
02:13:52,868 --> 02:13:54,103
He didn't tell me nothing.

1563
02:13:54,203 --> 02:13:56,147
You mean he didn't
say anything about Baker?

1564
02:13:56,247 --> 02:13:58,190
- Who?
- That agent!

1565
02:13:58,290 --> 02:13:59,984
Hell, no!

1566
02:14:00,084 --> 02:14:01,444
Now, well, he wouldn't.

1567
02:14:01,544 --> 02:14:04,530
You see, Baker's just been
calling you about 20 times a day.

1568
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:07,850
He is starting to get things
rolling for you, Woody!

1569
02:14:08,425 --> 02:14:10,744
Rolling how? What do you mean?

1570
02:14:10,844 --> 02:14:13,831
He's got you all signed up
to do a spot for CBS.

1571
02:14:13,931 --> 02:14:15,604
Coast to coast!

1572
02:14:16,308 --> 02:14:18,527
- Coast to coast?
- That's right!

1573
02:14:19,812 --> 02:14:21,422
Damn. Coast to coast.

1574
02:14:21,522 --> 02:14:23,883
And, that ain't all.
He's got an audition lined up

1575
02:14:23,983 --> 02:14:25,676
with some of the big hotel downtown.

1576
02:14:25,776 --> 02:14:28,679
A show like that could bring in
another hundred a week!

1577
02:14:28,779 --> 02:14:30,430
Damn!

1578
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:32,975
Shoot, Woody!

1579
02:14:33,075 --> 02:14:36,228
You're gonna wind up singing
to this whole damn country!

1580
02:14:36,328 --> 02:14:39,106
Come on, boy, we got us
some celebrating to do!

1581
02:14:39,206 --> 02:14:41,800
Damn! Coast to coast!

1582
02:15:12,865 --> 02:15:14,957
Come on, Woody.

1583
02:15:16,368 --> 02:15:17,540
Jesus!

1584
02:15:18,245 --> 02:15:20,464
Here comes Santy Claus!

1585
02:15:29,381 --> 02:15:31,133
Where is everybody?

1586
02:15:48,651 --> 02:15:50,844
Everybody's birthday!

1587
02:15:50,944 --> 02:15:54,744
And there ain't nobody getting any older.

1588
02:16:13,842 --> 02:16:15,094
Mary's gone.

1589
02:16:26,313 --> 02:16:28,315
She took the kids.

1590
02:16:33,362 --> 02:16:35,364
Gone back to Pampa.

1591
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,667
Oh, hell!

1592
02:16:52,297 --> 02:16:54,766
You don't think she left
'cause you got fired?

1593
02:16:55,926 --> 02:16:57,769
She left before that.

1594
02:17:00,264 --> 02:17:04,144
She always leaves the time on the note.

1595
02:17:08,147 --> 02:17:09,319
4:30.

1596
02:17:10,733 --> 02:17:14,283
4:30, yesterday afternoon.

1597
02:17:18,407 --> 02:17:20,705
Damn woman, anyhow.

1598
02:17:25,289 --> 02:17:28,293
Who the hell cares
what time you write a note?

1599
02:17:29,835 --> 02:17:31,178
Huh?

1600
02:17:34,006 --> 02:17:37,180
I'm in the mood for love

1601
02:17:39,636 --> 02:17:43,357
Simply because you're near me

1602
02:17:45,684 --> 02:17:49,530
Funny but when you're near me

1603
02:17:51,356 --> 02:17:56,112
I'm in the mood for love

1604
02:17:59,531 --> 02:18:02,309
You know, there's, uh,
steady money here at The Grove.

1605
02:18:02,409 --> 02:18:04,937
I'm gonna book you here for six weeks,

1606
02:18:05,037 --> 02:18:09,338
and then I'm gonna book you in every
top hotel and club in the country.

1607
02:18:11,418 --> 02:18:14,613
You know,
you gotta watch your step though at CBS.

1608
02:18:14,713 --> 02:18:18,183
You know, you gotta be careful
about the material you select.

1609
02:18:19,927 --> 02:18:22,413
Thank you. Thank you.

1610
02:18:22,513 --> 02:18:24,186
We already have a ballad singer.

1611
02:18:26,975 --> 02:18:28,919
I think we should see him.

1612
02:18:29,019 --> 02:18:32,631
Oh, Guthrie.
I had good reports about Guthrie.

1613
02:18:32,731 --> 02:18:34,108
Mr. Guthrie.

1614
02:19:09,101 --> 02:19:11,503
It's a mighty hard road

1615
02:19:11,603 --> 02:19:14,322
That these poor hands have hoed

1616
02:19:17,192 --> 02:19:19,678
My poor feet have traveled

1617
02:19:19,778 --> 02:19:22,452
A hot dusty road

1618
02:19:26,577 --> 02:19:29,188
On the edge of your city

1619
02:19:29,288 --> 02:19:31,774
You'll see us then and there

1620
02:19:31,874 --> 02:19:35,924
I've come with the dust and I'm gone

1621
02:19:37,462 --> 02:19:39,948
Mr. Guthrie. That's enough.

1622
02:19:40,048 --> 02:19:41,595
With the Wind

1623
02:19:42,134 --> 02:19:45,604
That's enough, Mr. Guthrie. Thank you!

1624
02:19:48,390 --> 02:19:50,142
You have a really nice quality.

1625
02:19:50,434 --> 02:19:52,044
Oh, he's wonderful.

1626
02:19:52,144 --> 02:19:54,192
I told you I had good reports about him.

1627
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:57,049
What kind of angle could we use?

1628
02:19:57,149 --> 02:19:58,651
I mean, Western?

1629
02:19:58,984 --> 02:20:02,488
How about a simple hillbilly presentation?

1630
02:20:03,071 --> 02:20:06,496
Big overalls, uh, maybe a straw hat.

1631
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,394
Stick him in front of a haystack.

1632
02:20:09,494 --> 02:20:11,271
You know, that might work.

1633
02:20:11,371 --> 02:20:13,774
We could get the, uh,
the Benton Brothers to back him up.

1634
02:20:13,874 --> 02:20:15,692
I think so. I think so.

1635
02:20:15,792 --> 02:20:18,445
Maybe they could use him
as a lead into something, you know...

1636
02:20:18,545 --> 02:20:23,158
Uh, excuse me, uh,
while you folks are talking to each other,

1637
02:20:23,258 --> 02:20:25,886
I wonder if you could tell me
which way is the bathroom.

1638
02:20:26,011 --> 02:20:29,311
Oh, out the door, turn right,
and, uh, first door on the right.

1639
02:20:50,994 --> 02:20:52,771
For God's sake,
this is a big chance for you.

1640
02:20:52,871 --> 02:20:55,983
Can you afford to throw it away?
Where you going?

1641
02:20:56,083 --> 02:20:58,277
Outta this damn hotel.

1642
02:20:58,377 --> 02:21:01,280
I got no desire to sing to folks that's

1643
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:05,742
drinking martinis and stuffing
themselves full of lamb chops.

1644
02:21:05,842 --> 02:21:09,037
Well, what about the CBS broadcast?
You gonna throw that away, too?

1645
02:21:09,137 --> 02:21:11,582
Tell you, standing in a radio station,

1646
02:21:11,682 --> 02:21:14,835
doing what they tell me to do
ain't my idea of having fun.

1647
02:21:14,935 --> 02:21:17,254
Now, come on, Woody,
now stop a minute and let's talk it out.

1648
02:21:17,354 --> 02:21:18,630
This is important to you.

1649
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:20,507
Oh, it ain't nothing, Ozark!

1650
02:21:20,607 --> 02:21:24,845
Tell you what's important.
The worse thing that can happen is

1651
02:21:24,945 --> 02:21:27,539
to cut yourself loose from the folks!

1652
02:21:29,074 --> 02:21:30,451
Where the hell are you going?

1653
02:21:31,702 --> 02:21:33,145
Just tell me where you're going!

1654
02:21:33,245 --> 02:21:34,730
Hell, I don't know.

1655
02:21:34,830 --> 02:21:37,959
Europe, New York, China.

1656
02:21:39,292 --> 02:21:40,861
New York.

1657
02:21:40,961 --> 02:21:42,988
Maybe I'll come with you.
When you leaving?

1658
02:21:43,088 --> 02:21:44,385
Now!

1659
02:21:44,756 --> 02:21:46,825
Dammit, Woody,
why do you have to go at everything

1660
02:21:46,925 --> 02:21:49,036
like you're killing snakes with a hoe?

1661
02:21:49,136 --> 02:21:51,622
- And why New York?
- Why the hell not?

1662
02:21:51,722 --> 02:21:55,208
It's got people, don't it?
It's got unions!

1663
02:21:55,308 --> 02:21:58,107
Besides, I can sing
while I'm walking there!

1664
02:21:59,104 --> 02:22:02,007
This land is your land

1665
02:22:02,107 --> 02:22:04,092
This land is my land

1666
02:22:04,192 --> 02:22:05,302
So long, Woody!

1667
02:22:05,402 --> 02:22:08,388
From California

1668
02:22:08,488 --> 02:22:11,808
To the New York island

1669
02:22:11,908 --> 02:22:14,645
From the redwood forest

1670
02:22:14,745 --> 02:22:17,189
To the Gulf Stream waters

1671
02:22:17,289 --> 02:22:21,443
I hate a song that makes you
think that you're not any good.

1672
02:22:21,543 --> 02:22:24,863
I hate a song that makes you
think you're just born to lose.

1673
02:22:24,963 --> 02:22:29,826
Bound to lose. No good to nobody.
No good for nothing.

1674
02:22:29,926 --> 02:22:32,496
Because you're either too old or too young

1675
02:22:32,596 --> 02:22:36,959
or too fat, or too thin, or too ugly,
or too this or too that.

1676
02:22:37,059 --> 02:22:40,045
Songs that run you down
and songs that poke fun of you

1677
02:22:40,145 --> 02:22:43,215
on account of your bad luck
or your hard traveling.

1678
02:22:43,315 --> 02:22:46,051
I am out to ﬁght those kinds of songs

1679
02:22:46,151 --> 02:22:49,972
to my very last breath of air
and my last drop of blood.

1680
02:22:50,072 --> 02:22:52,724
I'm out to sing songs and to prove to you

1681
02:22:52,824 --> 02:22:56,395
that this is your world
even if it's kicked you pretty hard

1682
02:22:56,495 --> 02:23:00,232
and knocked you down for a dozen loops,

1683
02:23:00,332 --> 02:23:03,735
no matter how hard it's run you down
or rolled over you,

1684
02:23:03,835 --> 02:23:07,280
no matter what color,
what size you are, how you're built,

1685
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:12,056
I am out to sing the songs
that'll make you take pride in yourself!

1686
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:17,791
Nobody livin'

1687
02:23:17,891 --> 02:23:20,627
Can ever stop me

1688
02:23:20,727 --> 02:23:23,588
As I go walkin'

1689
02:23:23,688 --> 02:23:26,591
Down freedom highway

1690
02:23:26,691 --> 02:23:29,594
Nobody livin'

1691
02:23:29,694 --> 02:23:32,823
Can make me turn back

1692
02:23:34,116 --> 02:23:37,586
This land was made for you and me

1693
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,795
I've roamed and rambled

1694
02:24:03,895 --> 02:24:06,131
And I followed my footsteps

1695
02:24:06,231 --> 02:24:08,300
To the sparkling sands of

1696
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,635
Her diamond deserts

1697
02:24:10,735 --> 02:24:12,763
And all around me

1698
02:24:12,863 --> 02:24:15,807
A voice was sounding

1699
02:24:15,907 --> 02:24:19,561
This land was made for you and me

1700
02:24:19,661 --> 02:24:21,813
When the sun comes shining

1701
02:24:21,913 --> 02:24:23,899
And I was strolling

1702
02:24:23,999 --> 02:24:26,401
And the wheat ﬁelds waving

1703
02:24:26,501 --> 02:24:28,570
And the dust clouds rolling

1704
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:30,822
As the fog was lifting

1705
02:24:30,922 --> 02:24:33,784
A voice was chanting

1706
02:24:33,884 --> 02:24:37,579
This land was made for you and me

1707
02:24:37,679 --> 02:24:39,956
Nobody livin'

1708
02:24:40,056 --> 02:24:42,125
Can ever stop me

1709
02:24:42,225 --> 02:24:44,336
As I go walkin'

1710
02:24:44,436 --> 02:24:46,713
Down freedom's highway

1711
02:24:46,813 --> 02:24:48,673
Nobody livin'

1712
02:24:48,773 --> 02:24:52,010
Can make me turn back

1713
02:24:52,110 --> 02:24:56,456
This land was made for you and me

1714
02:25:03,788 --> 02:25:07,317
I've sung this song, but I'll sing it over

1715
02:25:07,417 --> 02:25:10,695
The people I've met the places I've been

1716
02:25:10,795 --> 02:25:13,782
Some of the troubles that bothered my mind

1717
02:25:13,882 --> 02:25:17,285
And a lot of good people
that I've left behind

1718
02:25:17,385 --> 02:25:20,622
So long, it's been good to know you

1719
02:25:20,722 --> 02:25:23,792
So long, it's been good to know you

1720
02:25:23,892 --> 02:25:26,837
So long, it's been good to know you

1721
02:25:26,937 --> 02:25:29,941
What a long time Since I've been home

1722
02:25:31,316 --> 02:25:34,035
And I've gotta be drifting along

1723
02:25:34,861 --> 02:25:38,723
Tom Joad got out of that old McAlester pen

1724
02:25:38,823 --> 02:25:42,227
'Twas there that he got his parole

1725
02:25:42,327 --> 02:25:46,356
After four long years
on a man killing charge

1726
02:25:46,456 --> 02:25:49,067
Tom Joad came walking down the road

1727
02:25:49,167 --> 02:25:50,152
Oh, boy

1728
02:25:50,252 --> 02:25:53,572
Tom Joad came Walking down the road

1729
02:25:53,672 --> 02:25:56,032
Tell me what were their names

1730
02:25:56,132 --> 02:25:58,535
Tell me what were their names

1731
02:25:58,635 --> 02:26:00,495
Did you have a friend

1732
02:26:00,595 --> 02:26:03,123
On the good movin' train

1733
02:26:03,223 --> 02:26:04,916
What were their names

1734
02:26:05,016 --> 02:26:07,419
Tell me what were their names

1735
02:26:07,519 --> 02:26:09,296
Did you have a friend

1736
02:26:09,396 --> 02:26:11,756
On the good movin' train

1737
02:26:11,856 --> 02:26:14,985
I'm blowin' down this old dusty road

1738
02:26:15,527 --> 02:26:18,622
I'm blowin' down this old dusty road

1739
02:26:19,239 --> 02:26:22,493
I'm blowin' down this old dusty road

1740
02:26:22,826 --> 02:26:26,706
And I ain't gonna be treated this way

1741
02:26:27,038 --> 02:26:31,214
Roll on, Columbia, roll on

1742
02:26:31,543 --> 02:26:35,405
Roll on, Columbia, roll on

1743
02:26:35,505 --> 02:26:39,910
Your power is turning our darkness to dawn

1744
02:26:40,010 --> 02:26:43,765
So roll on, Columbia, roll on

1745
02:26:44,389 --> 02:26:46,833
I been havin' some hard travelin'

1746
02:26:46,933 --> 02:26:49,336
I thought you know'd

1747
02:26:49,436 --> 02:26:51,630
I been havin' some hard travelin'

1748
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:53,798
Way down the road

1749
02:26:53,898 --> 02:26:56,259
I been havin' some hard travelin'

1750
02:26:56,359 --> 02:26:58,553
Hard travelin, hard gamblin'

1751
02:26:58,653 --> 02:27:01,406
Been having some hard travelin' Lord

1752
02:27:02,282 --> 02:27:05,477
As I went walking

1753
02:27:05,577 --> 02:27:08,939
That ribbon of highway

1754
02:27:09,039 --> 02:27:11,650
I saw above me

1755
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:15,153
That endless skyway

1756
02:27:15,253 --> 02:27:18,615
And all around me

1757
02:27:18,715 --> 02:27:22,827
A voice keeps sayin'

1758
02:27:22,927 --> 02:27:28,166
This land was made for you and me

1759
02:27:28,266 --> 02:27:30,961
As I went walking

1760
02:27:31,061 --> 02:27:33,672
I saw a sign there

1761
02:27:33,772 --> 02:27:36,174
And on the sign it

1762
02:27:36,274 --> 02:27:39,177
Said no trespassing

1763
02:27:39,277 --> 02:27:41,763
But on the other side

1764
02:27:41,863 --> 02:27:44,491
It didn't say nothing

1765
02:27:45,575 --> 02:27:50,063
That side was made for you and me

1766
02:27:50,163 --> 02:27:52,816
This land is your land

1767
02:27:52,916 --> 02:27:55,443
This land is my land

1768
02:27:55,543 --> 02:27:57,904
From California

1769
02:27:58,004 --> 02:28:00,532
To the New York island

1770
02:28:00,632 --> 02:28:03,118
From the redwood forest

1771
02:28:03,218 --> 02:28:05,562
To the gulf stream waters
