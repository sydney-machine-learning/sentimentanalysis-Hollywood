1
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,889
Where you headed, little lady?

2
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:28,007
Nowhere with you, numb nuts.
Buzz off!

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,730
See you Thursday, gorgeous!

4
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:45,131
It's a pretty day to hitchhike.

5
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:49,261
I've got a little VW
at Stinson Beach with a cracked block.

6
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:54,300
You wouldn't be going
to Mill Valley, would you?

7
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:56,855
Aren't we going to Mill Valley?

8
00:00:57,102 --> 00:01:01,143
Got a couple bottles of
ice-cold beer up there.

9
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,823
You son of a bitch.

10
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,583
Okay, pile in!

11
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,380
How long you been with
Western Gas and Electric?

12
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,862
I can't remember how long.
How long I been in this?

13
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,781
Turn in here.

14
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:58,550
Climb up this road here.

15
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:21,227
I'll be right with you.

16
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,060
Hang a left here, Harry,
there's a jam on Bay.

17
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:07,346
What's with the citizen?

18
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:29,428
- Police officer, what's the problem?
- Thank God! He's inside!

19
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,235
Come on, it's a heart attack!

20
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,070
Wait here.

21
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,588
Make some room! Move aside!

22
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:41,069
Move aside.
This is an emergency!

23
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,871
Please move over!

24
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,112
Please give us room.
He's a police officer.

25
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:52,398
- Where's the ambulance?
- He had a heart attack.

26
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,677
He's still breathing, though.

27
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:01,672
Come on, get up.

28
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:05,472
Get up!
Get up, get up!

29
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,757
I say!

30
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,241
- Party's over.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.

31
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,996
Why are you squawking?
You got the free meal.

32
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,363
But I always enjoy
the ride in the ambulance.

33
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,717
Get out of here.

34
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,804
Harry, it's an all-units.

35
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,166
Marvelous.

36
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,560
My old lady will kill me.

37
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:43,486
She's doing a novena tonight
and I said I'd be home for supper.

38
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,002
<i>Suspects are armed.</i>

39
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,281
<i>Code 33.</i>

40
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:57,080
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

41
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,323
What's going on?

42
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,212
Bastards held up that liquor store.

43
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:16,730
One of our guys stumbled in
and they shot him.

44
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,453
They have four hostages.

45
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:22,132
They'll shoot them
unless we give them a car.

46
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,570
What're you waiting on?

47
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:25,535
Lieutenant Brannigan.

48
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,051
He said to stall until he gets here.

49
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:34,453
- Don't let them kill me!
- We want the goddamn car right now!

50
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:43,214
Okay, but you get nothing
till I come and talk.

51
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,896
Lay your piece on that car's hood!

52
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,370
What about me? I'm your partner.

53
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,296
I move fast. I don't need
extra linguini holding me back.

54
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,611
You got a lot of class, Harry.

55
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:30,866
You get cute, I blow this nice lady
all over you. Let's go.

56
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,786
On the floor, motherfucker.

57
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,589
For God's sake, do like he says!

58
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,542
- This is my best jacket.
- Get on the floor, you son of a bitch!

59
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,905
Spreadeagle! Move it!

60
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:52,627
Get down there.

61
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,901
San Francisco's finest.

62
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,389
Mitch.

63
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,426
Roll him over.

64
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,032
He's clean.

65
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,232
Here's the story.

66
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:20,392
First, we want all the pigs
out of here.

67
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,787
Second, we want a car...

68
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:29,154
...with a police radio.
Deliver it right out there in front.

69
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,307
We're taking two hostages.

70
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,035
Both the women.

71
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:38,710
You don't do what I tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off.

72
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,748
- You got the picture?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,875
What are you waiting for?

74
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,354
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

75
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,997
- What do they want?
- They want a car.

76
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:13,355
What are you going to do?

77
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:15,876
Give them one.

78
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,679
You son of a bitch!

79
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,124
Why's a man crazy enough
to join the cops?

80
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:14,882
If you find out, you let me know.

81
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:23,048
$ 14,379.

82
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:27,048
- How's that?
- Want an itemized account?

83
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:31,005
You took out two doors,
one window, 12 feet of counter...

84
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:35,613
...plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

85
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:40,372
And three hostages in the hospital
who will probably sue the city.

86
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,654
- Why?
- Excessive use of force.

87
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:44,570
For your information, Callahan...

88
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:48,288
...the minority community
hates this kind of police work.

89
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,211
By "minority community"
you mean the hoods?

90
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,132
So happens they're
American citizens too.

91
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,168
- The lady with the gun by her ear?
- I'm not debating this.

92
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,854
I've spoken to the mayor twice!

93
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,331
He went through the ceiling!

94
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,219
You mention the meeting?

95
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:08,100
- What?
- The meeting two months ago...

96
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:11,300
...when you said priority was
to run the hoods out.

97
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,690
Not with violence!

98
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,058
Should I yell "trick-or-treat"?

99
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:16,291
Come on.

100
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:19,138
I expect you
and everyone on this force...

101
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,615
...to be restrained
or turn in his resignation.

102
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:24,857
You're on notice, Harry.

103
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:28,381
That wild west show of yours
is exactly what...

104
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:31,378
...this department's
not going to tolerate!

105
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,105
Is that clear?

106
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:35,455
Yes, sir.

107
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:41,263
- Lf that's all, I've work to do.
- Not in homicide.

108
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:44,981
What?

109
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,385
You're transferred to personnel.

110
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,908
To personnel? That's for assholes.

111
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,502
I was in personnel for ten years.

112
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,344
Yeah.

113
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,500
That's it!

114
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:07,460
Report tomorrow to the oral
examining board, 9:00!

115
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,987
No, you haven't got the picture.

116
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,625
I'm the robber, you're the cop.

117
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:20,227
Now, I'm in a market.

118
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:23,385
You've just caught me.
A 211 in the act.

119
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,511
I'm coming out with a hostage:

120
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:30,192
A kid with a gun at his head.
There's no way to take me alive.

121
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:32,790
You have ten seconds to decide.

122
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,184
What do you do?

123
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:35,345
One...

124
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:37,473
...two, three...
- You're under arrest.

125
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:39,991
...four, five...
- Do something!

126
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:41,556
...six, seven.

127
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,265
Don't just stand there,
goddamn it, do something!

128
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,110
Bang, you're dead.

129
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,588
- You're late, Callahan.
- Sorry.

130
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,429
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.

131
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:55,155
Okay, Bustanoby,
you'll be given your grade.

132
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,312
You were told 9:00.

133
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,835
We have 50 officers to test.

134
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,350
- For how many vacancies?
- Eight.

135
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,673
Five men and three women
promoted to inspector in this group.

136
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,482
- Three women?
- Do you object, inspector?

137
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,761
Now who might you be?

138
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,391
Ms. Grey, from the mayor's staff.

139
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:18,473
She's to monitor the exams.

140
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:22,478
- This is Inspector Callahan.
- Yes, I know something of him.

141
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,041
And I'd like to tell you...

142
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:29,118
...the mayor's plan is to bring
this department into...

143
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,675
...the mainstream of
twentieth-century thought.

144
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:37,204
How does he figure to do that?

145
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,086
For one thing...

146
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:42,999
...His Honor intends to...

147
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:47,035
...broaden participation
for women in the police force.

148
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,517
Well, that sounds very stylish.

149
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,881
He also said something about...

150
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:57,565
...winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.

151
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:05,368
Well, we better move along.
Next applicant.

152
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,847
- Officer Moore?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,810
This is the final stage
in the examination.

154
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:18,489
It's an informal test to measure
your ability to think on your feet.

155
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,122
Your reaction to stress, pressure.

156
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,292
Your ability to use the law
in a hypothetical situation.

157
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:27,212
Yes, sir.

158
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,446
How long on the force?

159
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:31,447
- Nine years.
- What department?

160
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:34,371
Mainly Personnel and Records.

161
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,570
- Personnel and Records.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,696
Have you any questions
for the applicant?

163
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:53,294
Questions...
How fast do you run the hundred?

164
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:56,735
Come on, you know
how this board functions.

165
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,137
All right, I'm sorry.

166
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,657
You know...

167
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,017
...if you're inspector under
the new guidelines...

168
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,578
...you might be out
riding in a police car.

169
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:16,972
Yes, sir, that's what I hope for.

170
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,338
Officer Moore, tell us about...

171
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:21,812
...your greatest felony arrest.

172
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:25,580
I've never made a felony arrest.

173
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:31,652
Well, tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest.

174
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:35,617
I've never made a
misdemeanor arrest either.

175
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,379
What gives you the right
to be an inspector...

176
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:41,094
...when men have been
working 15 years!

177
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:44,338
Women stay home,
is that what you're saying?

178
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,424
You think it's an encounter group?

179
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,579
What will she do
if someone points a gun...

180
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,101
...and says, "Hit the deck"?!

181
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:54,385
You're trying to fail
this candidate, aren't you?

182
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:57,427
If she fails there,
she gets her ass blown off!

183
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,300
It's my ass!

184
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:03,026
And my hard luck.

185
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,067
Out there you'll have a partner.
You get blown away, he does too!

186
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,427
That's some price to pay
for being stylish!

187
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,900
Are you finished with the questioning?

188
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,824
Hypothetical situation, huh?

189
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:31,591
I'm standing on a corner
and Mrs. Grey propositions me...

190
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,906
...saying for $5.00
she'll put on a show...

191
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,864
...with a Shetland pony.
- Lf this is your idea of humor...

192
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:44,511
All right, what are you doing here?

193
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:48,427
Seeing if you know
what law's being broken...

194
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,747
...besides cruelty to animals.

195
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,517
That's a conspiracy,
title 7-182-1...

196
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,191
...of the California penal code.

197
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,394
Conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor...

198
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,234
...is a felony, and according to...
- Yes. Good answer.

199
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:05,790
Officer Moore,
you'll be given your grade.

200
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:29,231
After I get the guard's keys...

201
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:32,476
...we drive to the end,
warehouse 50-A. Lalo?

202
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,995
All right, now, that's...

203
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:39,998
...I drop you off at the small door
and go around...

204
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:43,476
...to the wharf side.
You open up the first big door.

205
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:47,354
I drive in and back up to
the compound on the right.

206
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:48,641
Karl and Tex?

207
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:51,684
Man, we grab
the M-16 automatic rifles.

208
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:52,962
Wanda?

209
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,202
Locate and take any explosives.

210
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,089
Dynamite, detonators, and plastics.

211
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:00,960
Right. Henry Lee?

212
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:05,043
I tote and load the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

213
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:06,238
Miki?

214
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,766
Locate the L.A.W. Rockets.
They'll be in the back.

215
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,606
It's the most important item.
You sure of the location?

216
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,921
I sweated there for five years!

217
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,002
They're there, I promise!

218
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,050
All right, you guys.

219
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,204
- This is for the people!
- Right on, for the people.

220
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,484
Jesus, spare me.

221
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:02,776
- What is it?
- Gas company.

222
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:05,328
- Why?
- Major gas leak in the area.

223
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,489
We'll check underground pipes.

224
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,299
Don't smoke until we say it's okay!

225
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,177
I won't, I won't.

226
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:24,974
It's seeping down in the earth.
This whole damn block could go!

227
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,974
- Got a phone I can use?
- Right this way.

228
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,093
Let's go.

229
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,149
Charlie left the gate open.

230
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:04,787
Better check it.

231
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,795
Tony, call backup.

232
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:37,636
- I'll check around.
- Frank, watch yourself.

233
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:56,519
L.A.W.S. Rocket.

234
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,084
- Beautiful!
- Yes.

235
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:04,840
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

236
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,722
You'll blow us out of here!
You all right?

237
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,566
Let us get these.

238
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,249
Freeze.

239
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,051
Hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

240
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,813
You back there.
Stand up so I can see you.

241
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,283
And drop that gun!

242
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,976
Put your hands over your head
and freeze!

243
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,608
- Now, wait a second.
- You shut up and listen.

244
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:08,090
You blink an eyelid
and I'll mail you home in a box!

245
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:10,215
All of you, against the fence!

246
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:12,297
Now!

247
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,973
You too, honey!

248
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,218
Oh, Jesus! Miki! Miki!

249
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:29,852
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

250
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,694
Baby, I'll get you out.
I'll get you home.

251
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:36,535
Bobby, help get her up.

252
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:39,456
- You'll get us caught.
- No, we'll make it.

253
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,773
- She's dead.
- She's not dead!

254
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:43,615
The hell she isn't!

255
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:49,981
Come on, it's over.

256
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:51,774
Bobby.

257
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,464
Get it on there.

258
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:15,027
Lalo, get up in there! Come on!

259
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:38,906
Halt, police! Halt, or I'll fire!

260
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,025
I'll get this son of a bitch!

261
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:44,708
Goddamn it!

262
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:57,394
He said it looked like
a regular company truck.

263
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,830
I'm asking the
Marin County sheriff.

264
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:04,705
Might tie in with the two bodies
found there last week.

265
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,106
Yes, sir.

266
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:11,231
How's DiGeorgio?

267
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:13,395
Well, Irene's with him now.

268
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,193
Is that some kind of answer?

269
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,108
He's been given the last rites.

270
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,236
- Get what you can.
- I will.

271
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,197
Listen, I'm sorry.

272
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,115
Hello, Harry.

273
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,238
He's been asking for you.

274
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:33,794
How is he?

275
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,873
He's in and out.

276
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:44,113
I'll smoke a cigarette.

277
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:48,441
It's a war, isn't it?

278
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,684
I guess I never really
understood that.

279
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:05,721
Harry.

280
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,281
Frank, what happened?

281
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,686
I had them, dead bang. And then I...

282
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,557
Sorry.

283
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:26,077
Frank?

284
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:28,804
Something you want to tell him?

285
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,325
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

286
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,443
...I seen him before.
- Where?

287
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,322
I just can't make the name.

288
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:43,687
Where do you know him from, Frank?

289
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,725
That homicide...

290
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,607
...young hooker...

291
00:28:47,854 --> 00:28:49,492
...in the Fillmore area.

292
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:51,612
The summer of '71.

293
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:56,573
- What about it?
- He was one of the pimps questioned.

294
00:28:57,454 --> 00:28:59,286
Liked him for it, Harry.

295
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,368
We liked him real good.

296
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:06,325
We liked everybody
north of Market on that one.

297
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:11,252
He had one of them cute,
little-boy names...

298
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:15,335
...Charlie something, or Bobby.

299
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:19,137
I'll check Records.
They'll have your notes.

300
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,050
Ten-to-one they blow it.

301
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:26,495
Not this time, Frank.

302
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,932
Maybe you better get some rest.

303
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:36,653
- Do you have to go just yet?
- Not if you don't want me to.

304
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:38,579
Thanks, Harry.

305
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:47,816
Get Irene.

306
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:58,901
- Talk to Records?
- Not yet. That was McKay.

307
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:03,902
We got a tape from the bastards.
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

308
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:09,544
Code Blue, Intensive Care.

309
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:12,982
30 minutes.

310
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:16,455
<i>One million dollars
or we blow things up.</i>

311
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:20,781
<i>People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
Remember Fessenheim.</i>

312
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:22,936
"Fessenheim"?

313
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:24,697
It's being checked.

314
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,100
People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
They on your list?

315
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,309
Nothing.

316
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,906
- Think it's legit?
- Probably not.

317
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,140
Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

318
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:43,061
What are you doing
about those records?

319
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:44,943
What do you mean?

320
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,626
I just talked to you about them!

321
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:52,425
Homicide! Fillmore District!
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

322
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,388
What do you mean, "written request"?

323
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,545
Well, who's got the keys?

324
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:02,634
I'm coming down there
in five minutes...

325
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:07,189
...you get those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

326
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:13,393
- You don't have to make threats.
- I'm gonna nail the guy...

327
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:16,197
...who carved DiGeorgio
on my own time!

328
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:17,631
That's unnecessary...

329
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:21,234
...you're back in Homicide
since 9, didn't you know?

330
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:25,790
I've been down in Records
looking up a homicide.

331
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:27,027
Any luck?

332
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,271
Well, I've got eleven names
of known pimps.

333
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,995
- I think our man's one of them.
- Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

334
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,148
Shall I tell you my instinct on this?

335
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,200
- Black Militants.
- No, it's all hookers.

336
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,910
The girl shot in the warehouse?
Miki Waleska.

337
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,595
A known prostitute.

338
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:49,437
What we've got is a
well-organized group of militants...

339
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:53,153
...with enough explosives to blow
San Francisco away...

340
00:31:53,403 --> 00:31:56,396
...including L.A.W.S. Rockets.
- L.A.W.S. Rockets?

341
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,124
The Army's giving a demonstration
at the firing range...

342
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,082
...in exactly 35 minutes.

343
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,713
I'd like everybody
on the case there...

344
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,875
...to see what you're against.

345
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,562
I've already been checked out
on the L.A.W.S. Rocket.

346
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,125
Your partner hasn't.

347
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:13,601
My partner?

348
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:22,519
Shit!

349
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:24,920
You know Inspector Moore?

350
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:28,321
Inspector.

351
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,238
I'll see you at the firing range.

352
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:34,120
Inspector?

353
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,364
Inspector, I know you aren't
overjoyed by this assignment.

354
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:45,683
- You don't think I'm up to it, do you?
- Right.

355
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:47,606
All right...

356
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:50,970
...let's get one thing straight.
I'm a woman.

357
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:53,681
I consider that fact irrelevant...

358
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:57,608
...because I don't expect
any special consideration.

359
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,127
Marvelous.

360
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:02,813
The L.A.W.S. Rocket: For all purposes...

361
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,813
...a one-shot disposable bazooka.

362
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,891
A fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

363
00:33:10,136 --> 00:33:12,969
...which fires a single projectile...

364
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:17,414
...designed to penetrate armor
three-quarters of an inch thick.

365
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:21,536
If you've all seen it,
I'll demonstrate how it works.

366
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:25,015
To fire the rocket, pull this pin...

367
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,135
...dropping the cover...

368
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,257
...then pull.

369
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,410
Front and rear sights spring up.

370
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,929
Got word from Pathology.

371
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,412
At noon they're posting the guard
that was killed. Check on it.

372
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:39,655
I'll be there.

373
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,739
- Captain?
- Go ahead.

374
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,778
Keep your eyes on that truck...

375
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:49,014
...I'll show how effective
this weapon can be.

376
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:10,938
Coming, inspector?

377
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,870
- Inspector?
- Yeah?

378
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:46,500
- 13.5 in my gym shorts.
- What?

379
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,828
My time in the hundred.
You asked me before.

380
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:52,381
- Think I was picking on you?
- Yes.

381
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,787
- It was nothing personal.
- Right.

382
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:58,672
I don't think you know
what Homicide does.

383
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:01,791
- I'll find out.
- I hope not the hard way.

384
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,671
How fast do you run the hundred?

385
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:05,506
Beats me.

386
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,595
I meant to say I'm sorry
about your partner.

387
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,392
He's not the first one.

388
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:14,867
Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

389
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,710
- How'd you know?
- Checked your records.

390
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:20,107
I don't want to get killed either.

391
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:21,471
What's the matter?

392
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:24,357
Black guy with the briefcase.
I know him.

393
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:26,111
- Tan suit?
- Yeah.

394
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:28,710
What did he do?

395
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,592
Can't remember. It's not important.

396
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:36,958
- Ever been to one of these before?
- No.

397
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,551
In that case, I'd suggest
you sit out here.

398
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,713
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

399
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,310
Hello, Harry.

400
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,234
Who's the pretty lady?

401
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,791
My partner, Inspector Moore.

402
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:58,514
- You missed most of it.
- We were at the firing range.

403
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:02,040
I have it on tape.
We finished the abdomen.

404
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:03,797
The wound matters.

405
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:07,037
The entry wound
was above the renal area...

406
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:10,441
...between ribs,
penetrating the chest cavity...

407
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:12,198
...piercing the lung.

408
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:15,357
There was also damage
to some other organs...

409
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:17,562
...pancreas, kidneys.

410
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:20,806
- What kind of knife?
- A long, heavy blade.

411
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:23,318
We're going in the skull now.

412
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:28,198
I'd say it was one of those
killing knives...

413
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:31,679
...a Marine Corps boy,
or Special Forces.

414
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:33,203
Bruises on the face?

415
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:36,884
The killer put his hand
over the mouth from behind.

416
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,121
- Professional?
- Textbook.

417
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:43,686
On first exam,
no exterior damage to the skull.

418
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:24,528
Subject brain shows no
contrecoup damage or clotting.

419
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:27,377
Jesus H. Christ, come look at this!

420
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:30,529
- It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- What?

421
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:33,531
It says "Eat at Luigi's!"

422
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,899
Welcome to Homicide.

423
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:09,860
What are you doing?

424
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,177
Excuse me, I'm with him.

425
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:22,945
I was coming down the hall
to take a leak when it blew!

426
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:24,943
Anybody in there?

427
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,222
- I don't think so.
- Where you going?

428
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,503
A group of kids, some are missing.

429
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:33,546
- Help him out.
- Me?

430
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:36,177
Great, just step out here, will you?

431
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,623
Well, we were lucky this time.

432
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:43,220
It's getting so you can't
even pee in peace.

433
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,066
- We got them, they're okay.
- Good.

434
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:51,985
You didn't...

435
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,304
...see anybody go in there, did you?
- No.

436
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,829
You sure? Black guy,
tan hat and suit, briefcase.

437
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:02,829
- I saw a guy like that.
- Short guy, about 5' 1 "?

438
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,824
No, this dude was six foot.

439
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:06,347
That's him.

440
00:39:10,993 --> 00:39:12,825
It's a bomb. I saw who did it.

441
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:14,633
- Any idea?
- Looked familiar.

442
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,513
Just a minute.

443
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,866
You'd better check mug shots.

444
00:39:19,114 --> 00:39:22,186
Honey, we're talking.
This is very important.

445
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:25,553
Better check mug shots,
we got another message.

446
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,388
They want two million.

447
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:28,672
- Two?
- I just saw him.

448
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:31,591
- Who?
- Tan suit, hat, and a briefcase.

449
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,507
- Where?
- Right down here.

450
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:38,750
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- Why the hell didn't you ask?

451
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,718
There he is, look!

452
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,010
Jesus!

453
00:42:41,348 --> 00:42:42,337
Damn it.

454
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:23,272
What the hell's going on?

455
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:27,346
What are you doing here?

456
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,672
- Who are you?
- Police officer.

457
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:32,921
Speedy, you're under arrest.

458
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:35,839
God, this is a church!
What are you doing?

459
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:38,122
I'm a cop. He's under arrest.

460
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:41,405
Father, I did nothing!
This guy's rousting me!

461
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:44,446
Is it asking too much
to see a badge, officer?

462
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,115
He runs like a rabbit, I won't let go.

463
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:50,008
I'd like to see the badge now!

464
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:51,838
If you insist.

465
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,367
- Callahan, Inspector.
- Callahan...

466
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,158
...you're a disgrace to this city!

467
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,447
Okay! Nobody move!

468
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:15,240
Marvelous.

469
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:20,250
I think so.
Harry, wait, I'm talking to...

470
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:21,846
Jesus Christ!

471
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:23,610
Give him my best.

472
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,083
I'll call you back!

473
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:27,689
It's been disarmed
by the bomb squad.

474
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,291
It's the explosive from
the Hamilton Firearms works.

475
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:35,045
At times I can only
stand you as a human.

476
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:37,288
What about the punk?

477
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:39,891
- The suspect.
- "Suspect," my ass!

478
00:45:40,136 --> 00:45:44,051
He won't talk, but we have a make.
He's Henry Lee Caldwell.

479
00:45:44,297 --> 00:45:47,494
Member of a Black Militant group
called Uhuru.

480
00:45:48,298 --> 00:45:50,654
- Pusseau, shelve that.
- Uhuru?

481
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:53,970
It's run by a guy called
Big Ed Mustapha.

482
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,131
Mustapha, in the Mission District.

483
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,213
I thought he was familiar.
Where's my partner?

484
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,371
She's in the can.

485
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:04,691
Been there since she found out...

486
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:08,296
...she was packing this thing
all over San Francisco!

487
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,816
Do me a favor. Go easy on her.

488
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:14,213
It's her first day
and it's been a long one.

489
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:18,861
She wants to play lumberjack,
she has to handle her end of the log.

490
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:39,498
I give up. What's this?

491
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:43,342
The Fillmore chapter of the V.F. W:
Very Few Whites.

492
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:47,462
Can I suggest you wait in the car,
inspector?

493
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,824
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

494
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:57,906
Well, if it ain't
Mighty Whitey and friend.

495
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:01,185
I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

496
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,104
Sorry, honky, she can stay,
but you got to go.

497
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,266
Yeah, baby, we trying to keep up
standards, understand.

498
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,151
- You aren't making us welcome.
- You're welcome!

499
00:47:12,392 --> 00:47:15,189
As welcome as a turd in a pool!

500
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:27,988
Well, look here, if it ain't the fuzz.

501
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:29,747
I'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

502
00:47:29,993 --> 00:47:34,193
- You got a warrant, honky?
- What I got is Henry Lee Caldwell.

503
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:36,235
I never heard of him.

504
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:40,470
Let's see how fast you fuzz
can get your white asses out.

505
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,067
What is Henry Lee into now?

506
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:50,830
He's playing with dynamite.
You Mustapha?

507
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:53,110
Yeah, that's right.

508
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:56,307
Just come into my office here.

509
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:59,068
Just you.

510
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,917
Don't worry, pig,
she won't get lonesome.

511
00:48:06,921 --> 00:48:08,912
That's mighty white of you.

512
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:14,321
Before we do anything uncalled-for...

513
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,793
...I'd like to point out
that I'm an officer.

514
00:48:26,683 --> 00:48:28,036
Callahan.

515
00:48:28,524 --> 00:48:30,196
Where do I know you from?

516
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:34,834
You don't.

517
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:37,957
I just know you.

518
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:46,637
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

519
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:48,440
Saying you don't know?

520
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:52,202
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

521
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:53,926
Where is he?

522
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:58,358
He went white.
Why, he do something else foolish?

523
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:04,248
He and his friends helped
rip off the Hamilton Firearms.

524
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,122
I heard about that.

525
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:08,722
You wanna buy into that?

526
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:11,121
Four counts of murder,
aiding and abetting?

527
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:15,523
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

528
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:18,126
- What do you deal in?
- Waiting.

529
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:20,240
For what?

530
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:25,361
Waiting for all you honkies...

531
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:29,004
...to blow each other up
so we can move on in.

532
00:49:31,214 --> 00:49:33,569
Talk about Henry Lee
and his friends.

533
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:37,768
Some dudes he met in Vietnam. Why?

534
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,649
Anybody on this list here grab you?

535
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,929
Hey, man, why should I help you?

536
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:50,446
I can talk to Robbery.
They'd be interested in this...

537
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:52,489
...elaborate furnishing.

538
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:54,375
What are you talking about?

539
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:58,135
"Room 401, Fairmont. "

540
00:49:59,899 --> 00:50:01,651
"Rest at the Holiday Inn. "

541
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,211
Okay, okay, okay, so?

542
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:06,817
Maybe they're a little warm.

543
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,659
I tell you what...

544
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,492
...one of my boys got busted
on possession.

545
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,371
You get him off, and ignore
my interior decorator...

546
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,693
...and I'll see what I can do.

547
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:21,695
- That's a lot.
- You want a lot.

548
00:50:23,262 --> 00:50:26,459
A thing like this can ruin my image.

549
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:31,216
I'll see what I can do.

550
00:50:32,143 --> 00:50:33,862
What about the list?

551
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:43,899
Bobby Maxwell.

552
00:50:47,106 --> 00:50:50,065
- He's the main man.
- You know him?

553
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:52,463
Stone waste of white.

554
00:50:52,707 --> 00:50:54,504
Where can I find him?

555
00:50:55,868 --> 00:50:57,506
I'll check around.

556
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:01,985
You do that. Much obliged.

557
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:05,700
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

558
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,779
How do you figure that?

559
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,027
You put your ass on the line...

560
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,900
...for dudes who wouldn't
let you in the door any more...

561
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:16,226
...than they would me.

562
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:18,947
- It's not for them.
- Who, then?

563
00:51:22,593 --> 00:51:24,787
You wouldn't believe me if I told.

564
00:51:28,594 --> 00:51:31,950
...if I pull this piece...
- Having fun, inspector?

565
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:35,312
If you're done socializing,
we have work to do.

566
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:38,634
Son of a bitch.

567
00:51:41,116 --> 00:51:44,587
If you have an objection
to how I handled myself...

568
00:51:44,837 --> 00:51:46,429
...I wish you'd say so!

569
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:49,153
I thought I was doing all right.

570
00:51:55,919 --> 00:51:57,192
Marvelous.

571
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:50,797
All right, Mustapha...

572
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:55,163
...this is Captain McKay
of the S.F.P.D.

573
00:52:56,407 --> 00:53:00,402
Throw down your weapons
and come out peacefully.

574
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,001
You are totally surrounded.

575
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:11,689
Mustapha, do you hear me?

576
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,407
Come out with your hands raised
over your head.

577
00:53:48,377 --> 00:53:50,333
I don't want to seem ungrateful...

578
00:53:50,576 --> 00:53:52,931
...I just feel that
it might be better.

579
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:55,738
Well, I'm still a little confused...

580
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:58,967
...you and the S.W.A.T. Team
did it...

581
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:02,177
...but credit goes to
Moore and Callahan?

582
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:04,932
I felt it might be a better tactic...

583
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:08,137
...politically, with
the election coming up...

584
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:12,214
...to show the guidelines for
the police department worked.

585
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:15,612
Kind of "I told you so,"
if you know what I mean.

586
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:20,059
Yes, I see. It's an excellent idea.
What do you think, Jimmy?

587
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:22,698
I couldn't agree more.

588
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:26,172
You have proved to be an asset...

589
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:28,812
...to the force and
the administration.

590
00:54:29,063 --> 00:54:29,939
Thank you.

591
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,892
The commendation presentation
starts in five minutes.

592
00:54:34,144 --> 00:54:36,817
- We better get going.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

593
00:54:37,063 --> 00:54:39,784
Off the record,
there will be changes...

594
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:44,224
...after the election,
and you'll figure greatly in my plans.

595
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:47,457
I'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

596
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:54,415
Can you comment on the
arrest of the Black Militants?

597
00:54:54,868 --> 00:54:56,665
Later, Jim, later.

598
00:54:57,708 --> 00:55:01,701
As mayor of San Francisco,
I want to make it official.

599
00:55:02,108 --> 00:55:05,943
This is one hell of a cop!
And here come a couple more.

600
00:55:06,189 --> 00:55:07,747
Hello. Right this way.

601
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:11,062
Lt. Bressler, Inspector Moore,
move to the stairs.

602
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,300
Mayor, would you join them?

603
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,145
We'll have some photographs taken.

604
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:21,904
- Is this all right?
- Yes.

605
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,620
Would you move in a little tighter?

606
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,788
Gentlemen, the inspectors who made
the Mustapha arrest.

607
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:32,867
This is Inspector Moore and Callahan.

608
00:55:33,954 --> 00:55:37,389
How about one with
the mayor and Inspector Moore?

609
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,184
Captain McKay, switch places
with Inspector Moore?

610
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:44,349
Move in close.

611
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:47,063
Callahan, you get in there too.

612
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,106
We're ready.

613
00:55:49,356 --> 00:55:52,791
Inspector Moore is one of
the first of her sex...

614
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:55,710
...to become a homicide investigator.

615
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:59,746
We're very proud of her
stunning professionalism.

616
00:56:01,118 --> 00:56:02,995
Thank you very much.

617
00:56:03,438 --> 00:56:07,033
Jimmy, give me time with these people.

618
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:09,918
Certainly. Can we move to the right?

619
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,276
I'll see you at the conference.

620
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,274
Anybody have the
letters of commendation?

621
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:18,594
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir?

622
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:21,230
- Who's got the letters?
- Right here.

623
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:25,199
- Wait, what's this?
- Some form letters.

624
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:28,595
So you hand them
something for the cameras.

625
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:29,991
Well, all right.

626
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:31,642
Thank you, Jimmy.

627
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:36,194
The Mayor will introduce you,
hand you the letters...

628
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:39,004
...and then move
to the left off-camera.

629
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:41,235
I'll take this opportunity...

630
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:43,760
...to deliver a boot in the rear...

631
00:56:44,006 --> 00:56:47,441
...to the people who think
the force has failed...

632
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:49,404
...under this administration.

633
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,325
Two minutes, Mr. Mayor.

634
00:56:51,565 --> 00:56:53,238
Well, ready? Let's go.

635
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:59,127
- Just one minute, Mr. Mayor.
- Harry!

636
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:02,245
Can you tell me what these are for?

637
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,844
- Wait until after the broadcast.
- No.

638
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,965
All right, just watch it.

639
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:11,123
He has a right to know
what he's being commended for.

640
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:16,719
Specifically, it's for your part in
smashing the group of terrorists...

641
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:21,408
...who were trying to blackmail
the city out of two million dollars.

642
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:22,800
Let's look at...

643
00:57:23,052 --> 00:57:26,124
If you mean Mustapha,
nobody smashed a thing.

644
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:30,044
I made a deal with Mustapha
to help me find them.

645
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:33,409
- Moore and I weren't there.
- What's he mean?

646
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:37,852
- No weapons or explosives were found?
- We'll find them!

647
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:41,086
They're still out there!
They'll blow the city!

648
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,290
You're saying how great we are.

649
00:57:43,535 --> 00:57:45,286
Callahan, button your lip!

650
00:57:45,535 --> 00:57:48,733
Don't jerk them off with me!

651
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:52,889
- You got yourself a 60-day suspension!
- Make it 90!

652
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:55,092
180! Give me your star!

653
00:57:57,576 --> 00:58:00,296
Here's a seven-point suppository,
captain.

654
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:04,452
- What did you say?
- I said stick it in your ass.

655
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,291
- Mayor, you're on.
- I know, Jimmy, I know.

656
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:26,978
I'll have to go down there...

657
00:58:29,061 --> 00:58:32,294
Go down there and jerk them off.

658
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:38,178
Inspector!

659
00:58:39,823 --> 00:58:41,495
Inspector Callahan!

660
00:58:44,824 --> 00:58:47,100
Damn it, Harry, slow down!

661
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:53,384
What's the matter?

662
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:54,815
Nothing!

663
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,978
Why aren't you getting
your commendation?

664
00:58:58,587 --> 00:59:01,545
- Do you ever give up?
- Sometimes.

665
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:03,904
Not you.

666
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:06,498
What makes you think so?

667
00:59:06,987 --> 00:59:08,898
Woman's intuition.

668
00:59:13,189 --> 00:59:17,705
If you need anything or
if there's anything I can do...

669
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,545
...access to records or files...

670
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:23,709
...anything. Call me up.

671
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:26,342
I might just do that.

672
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:27,991
Fine.

673
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,107
Any time.

674
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:36,428
- Come on, take a walk.
- All right.

675
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:46,624
I wonder if I'll still have a job
when I get back.

676
00:59:46,873 --> 00:59:48,706
What's the difference?

677
00:59:50,075 --> 00:59:52,350
Why'd you want to be a cop, anyway?

678
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:55,948
Why don't you marry and have kids?

679
00:59:56,196 --> 00:59:57,549
Why aren't you?

680
00:59:58,675 --> 01:00:01,316
Nobody in their right mind's asking.

681
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:06,389
- Coitus interruptus.
- I beg your pardon?

682
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:10,314
Coit Tower.
It's vaguely phallic, don't you think?

683
01:00:12,397 --> 01:00:14,514
Never thought of it that way.

684
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:17,356
I make up names for things.

685
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,276
You're "Cold, Bold Callahan"
with a great big. 44.

686
01:00:24,841 --> 01:00:28,470
Every other cop is satisfied
with a. 38 or a. 357...

687
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:31,189
...why must you carry that cannon?

688
01:00:31,722 --> 01:00:33,917
So I can hit what I aim at.

689
01:00:34,162 --> 01:00:37,314
.357 is good, but I've seen 38s
careen off windshields.

690
01:00:37,523 --> 01:00:39,195
No good in the city.

691
01:00:39,442 --> 01:00:43,437
I see. So it's for the penetration.

692
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:48,122
Does everything have
a sexual connotation?

693
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:51,356
Only sometimes.

694
01:00:52,324 --> 01:00:54,714
Want to go have a few beers?

695
01:00:59,806 --> 01:01:04,323
You got a lot of nerve the way
you talk to the mayor, and McKay.

696
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,118
They're wrong and stupid.

697
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:11,647
They got the wrong guy,
but their egos won't admit it.

698
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:14,521
- You mean Mustapha.
- Yeah.

699
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,086
I had a deal with Mustapha.

700
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:21,323
He put me onto Bobby Maxwell,
the guy who knifed DiGeorgio.

701
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:26,525
- Where do we find Maxwell?
- We can't with Mustapha busted.

702
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:29,529
Maxwell's a prime candidate,
a tough cookie.

703
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,568
Was in Vietnam, likes combat.

704
01:01:31,812 --> 01:01:34,609
He was busted out on a Section Eight.

705
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:37,730
We're good people.
Let's post Mustapha's bail.

706
01:01:37,973 --> 01:01:39,371
Not a bad idea.

707
01:01:40,052 --> 01:01:42,772
Question is, will he work with us now?

708
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,162
Want to have a few beers?

709
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:50,251
Why didn't I think of that?

710
01:01:57,015 --> 01:01:58,894
All they had was apple juice.

711
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:00,808
- Anything's okay.
- Here.

712
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:02,534
I'm sorry.

713
01:02:04,175 --> 01:02:05,768
You like fishing?

714
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:09,815
I have an Auntie Kate.
I'm called after her.

715
01:02:10,538 --> 01:02:14,132
When I was a little girl,
she had a ranch in Oroville.

716
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:18,732
We used to fish.
I'd even bait my own hooks.

717
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:22,055
Is that what they call you? Kate?

718
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:24,931
That or Inspector Moore.

719
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:30,695
Inspector Moore, I don't
get friendly with partners.

720
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:34,059
I know. I mean, I understand.

721
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:35,933
Kate...

722
01:02:36,701 --> 01:02:40,536
...whoever gets you as
a partner could do much worse.

723
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:09,944
I think if we want to beat
the crowds, we should leave.

724
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:13,657
Think so? You may be right.

725
01:03:13,908 --> 01:03:15,626
I'll see you, Karl.

726
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:17,427
No need to come with us.

727
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,943
- Take over.
- Take it easy.

728
01:03:20,149 --> 01:03:21,742
You hold on to this.

729
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:29,143
- Nice to see you!
- We're running late, sir.

730
01:03:47,393 --> 01:03:49,509
All right, talk to me.

731
01:03:49,753 --> 01:03:51,550
- He's on his way.
- Beautiful.

732
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:54,469
- Everything set?
- I'm ready.

733
01:04:41,722 --> 01:04:42,791
Hi there.

734
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:46,518
Hello there, young lady.
What can I do for you?

735
01:04:47,122 --> 01:04:48,954
Raise the bridge.

736
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:52,120
Raise the bridge?

737
01:04:52,924 --> 01:04:54,243
Are you kidding?

738
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:56,323
When I tell you to.

739
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:05,924
I wish we could've stayed.

740
01:05:07,326 --> 01:05:09,682
I think the Giants will finally win.

741
01:05:09,928 --> 01:05:14,124
I don't know, mayor, looked like
it would end a no-hitter.

742
01:05:14,686 --> 01:05:17,043
You have the testimonial tonight.

743
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:22,488
Oh, God, testimonials.
They never end, do they?

744
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,566
Give me the Taser gun.

745
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:29,122
Karl?

746
01:05:35,971 --> 01:05:38,848
This looks like something from
James Bond.

747
01:05:39,091 --> 01:05:40,524
Sure it'll work?

748
01:05:41,331 --> 01:05:44,165
Karl, there's 25,000 volts
in this thing.

749
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:48,531
Even the fat boy will do
what we want once we zap him.

750
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:57,846
Okay, Tex.

751
01:06:07,415 --> 01:06:09,007
Raise it.

752
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:36,370
What the hell? Get me out of this.

753
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:44,498
Don't hit the mayor, damn it!

754
01:07:06,305 --> 01:07:09,742
- Who are you? What do you want?
- You.

755
01:07:10,307 --> 01:07:13,776
Son of a bitch!
I'm not going anywhere with you!

756
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:15,665
The hell you aren't!

757
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:17,710
We're trying to get details,
and as they come in you'll get them.

758
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:19,948
<i>They said the mayor was killed.</i>

759
01:08:20,157 --> 01:08:22,955
At first. Then we heard
he was kidnapped.

760
01:08:23,157 --> 01:08:25,797
There's something going on
in China Basin.

761
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,713
I've got to go. Thanks for calling.

762
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,630
You're rapping with Bubba.

763
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,713
The mayor has been taken
prisoner of war...

764
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,952
...by the People's
Revolutionary Strike Force.

765
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,956
Everybody's a comedian.
Look, this is serious!

766
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:46,872
I'm leaving a tape of our demands
in the phone booth across the street.

767
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:49,430
<i>Power to the people!</i>

768
01:08:50,281 --> 01:08:53,958
We'll do a little music and
I'll be right back!

769
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:13,681
Harry?

770
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:18,198
- What can I do for you?
- We've got to talk.

771
01:09:18,486 --> 01:09:19,999
Go right ahead.

772
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:25,401
I want all the info that
you have on this case.

773
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:30,163
- Black Militants, remember?
- Come on, so we were wrong.

774
01:09:31,248 --> 01:09:34,958
- I'll handle this one.
- No! We play as a team.

775
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:40,403
The last time we did that
I got the cue stuck in my ass.

776
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:44,200
We just got a tape.
Now they want five million.

777
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,089
Or they send back the mayor in pieces.

778
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,561
The negotiations are crucial now.

779
01:09:49,771 --> 01:09:52,366
What will you do, pay the bastards?

780
01:09:52,853 --> 01:09:57,767
The mayor's family is loaded,
they can afford it.

781
01:09:58,413 --> 01:10:01,723
What about those who were killed?
Isn't that illegal?

782
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:04,728
We're not debating the point.

783
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:06,123
You're saying...

784
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:10,494
...anyone with the balls to take
hostages can walk away?

785
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:12,573
I'm saying you're out.

786
01:10:12,815 --> 01:10:16,570
If I hear otherwise,
you're finished as a cop here.

787
01:10:16,816 --> 01:10:21,971
I want all the information
you have on this case, every lead.

788
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:24,771
- May I speak, McKay?
- Go ahead!

789
01:10:25,056 --> 01:10:27,572
Your mouthwash ain't making it!

790
01:10:39,499 --> 01:10:41,171
Callahan...

791
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,135
...you got more surprises for me?

792
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:49,340
What do you mean?

793
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,016
Are you and McKay throwing another...

794
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:55,413
...paddy-wagon party for me?

795
01:10:56,622 --> 01:10:59,421
Frigging McKay.
He's something, isn't he?

796
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:03,535
I want a line on this
Revolutionary Strike Force.

797
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:08,338
- You gots to be kidding!
- No, I'm not kidding.

798
01:11:08,584 --> 01:11:11,224
If you don't,
I'll say you're an ear.

799
01:11:11,464 --> 01:11:14,776
Hey, don't say that, not even joking.

800
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:19,783
Who's joking?

801
01:11:21,066 --> 01:11:24,979
You really are a dirty bastard,
ain't you, Harry?

802
01:11:25,187 --> 01:11:26,382
The dirtiest.

803
01:11:31,349 --> 01:11:33,782
Word has it that Bobby Maxwell...

804
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:35,946
...and his chick Wanda...

805
01:11:36,549 --> 01:11:38,983
...they're running around
calling themselves...

806
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:42,506
...the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force.

807
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:46,538
- "Calling themselves"?
- They don't believe in that shit...

808
01:11:46,989 --> 01:11:50,619
...they're into the bread,
that's how they think.

809
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:52,987
Where do I find this Wanda?

810
01:11:53,232 --> 01:11:57,669
She's a tall brunette, works at
Tiffany's on Broadway.

811
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,426
Thanks.

812
01:12:02,032 --> 01:12:03,260
Callahan.

813
01:12:05,874 --> 01:12:07,511
Do them in.

814
01:12:08,554 --> 01:12:10,511
You can count on that.

815
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,667
Hi there!

816
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:43,388
- Is this Tiffany's?
- Like the sign says.

817
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:45,038
I'm Larry Dickman...

818
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,874
...my brother was here,
tall, balding?

819
01:12:48,081 --> 01:12:49,230
Remember him well!

820
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,718
- Has a gold tooth in front?
- That's him.

821
01:12:54,801 --> 01:12:57,031
You know what I bet you'd like?

822
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:59,957
I bet you want to learn
the love tussle.

823
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,958
That sounds swell,
but I'm looking for a certain girl.

824
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:06,398
We have many, warm and willing.

825
01:13:06,644 --> 01:13:08,599
- Her name's Wanda.
- Anybody you want.

826
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,914
My brother says she's terrific.

827
01:13:11,164 --> 01:13:12,153
Can I trust you?

828
01:13:12,404 --> 01:13:13,280
Yeah.

829
01:13:13,524 --> 01:13:15,720
What it is, is $ 75.

830
01:13:15,965 --> 01:13:19,845
- $ 75?
- Of course, that includes...

831
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:25,161
We shouldn't do this,
because the heat's on.

832
01:13:25,406 --> 01:13:27,443
Seeing your brother was here...

833
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:31,919
...the $ 75 includes
personal instructions...

834
01:13:32,168 --> 01:13:34,965
...in 32 positions of lovemaking!

835
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,841
That many?

836
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:41,281
$ 75, you pay me first.

837
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:43,802
Oh, yeah.

838
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:51,969
Right this way.

839
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,160
What's this?

840
01:14:03,413 --> 01:14:06,688
You've seen dummies.
It's the same principle.

841
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:11,083
For $ 75 you get to make it
with a rubber dolly.

842
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:12,767
Thirty-two ways!

843
01:14:12,974 --> 01:14:13,963
Any objections?

844
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:17,365
Is there one where
the man gets on top?

845
01:14:17,574 --> 01:14:19,007
That's 33!

846
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:22,811
Take your duds off.
I'll send the teacher in.

847
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,896
- Hi there.
- You're not Wanda.

848
01:14:30,136 --> 01:14:32,810
These are the breaks. Needs air.

849
01:14:33,217 --> 01:14:35,685
Can't hump a limp dummy, I say.

850
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:41,131
Speaking of limp dummies, strip.

851
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:42,368
Where's Wanda?

852
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:45,416
Beats the hell out of me, Tom.

853
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:53,211
I'll ask you just one last time.

854
01:14:53,461 --> 01:14:56,339
- Where's Wanda?
- I don't know, I don't know.

855
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,811
She left a couple weeks ago.

856
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:01,700
Ask Buchinski!
He runs the whole street.

857
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:05,697
- Where's Buchinski?
- Down the hall to the right.

858
01:15:49,709 --> 01:15:51,745
<i>Yes, nearer my God to thee...</i>

859
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:53,628
<i>...so brother Bob's here.</i>

860
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,065
<i>Brother Bob will bring you to God.</i>

861
01:15:56,311 --> 01:15:59,223
<i>Bring you to the Man
to save your soul.</i>

862
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,463
<i>Salvation is where it's at.</i>

863
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:05,629
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

864
01:16:05,871 --> 01:16:09,070
- You a lawyer?
- Yes, I am. Whoever you are...

865
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:11,508
I'm looking for a tall brunette,
Wanda.

866
01:16:11,753 --> 01:16:15,542
I'll tell you something, punk.
It's a protected operation.

867
01:16:15,794 --> 01:16:18,705
You'll end up with
your balls in spaghetti sauce.

868
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:21,594
You have clout with the syndicate?

869
01:16:21,835 --> 01:16:25,715
I can blow you away with one call,
so get the hell out!

870
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:30,313
To me, you're just a maggot
who sells dirty pictures.

871
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:52,636
- Wanda! Where is she?
- Go to hell.

872
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,551
- One more time. Wanda?
- All right, all right.

873
01:16:58,801 --> 01:17:01,440
She quit a few weeks ago,
it's all I know.

874
01:17:03,282 --> 01:17:04,920
She got religion.

875
01:17:05,642 --> 01:17:09,318
- What do you mean?
- Hanging by a church on Garvey.

876
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:18,241
<i>Have you received another tape
from the People's Strike Force?</i>

877
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:20,122
<i>- Yes.
- Is the mayor all right?</i>

878
01:17:20,365 --> 01:17:24,722
<i>We've been assured that he's
all right, but there'll be...</i>

879
01:17:25,046 --> 01:17:28,515
<i>...no payment or transportation
until we have...</i>

880
01:17:28,765 --> 01:17:30,323
<i>...seen the mayor.</i>

881
01:17:30,566 --> 01:17:33,798
<i>- Then you're letting them go?
- That's the agreement.</i>

882
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:37,084
<i>- Any idea where they are?
- Not yet.</i>

883
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:40,842
<i>We should get one more
message this evening.</i>

884
01:17:41,086 --> 01:17:45,923
<i>- Is Inspector Callahan off this case?
- Sorry, no more questions.</i>

885
01:17:54,529 --> 01:17:55,519
What do you have?

886
01:17:55,769 --> 01:17:59,649
The priest, Father John Voss.
Militant, big in prison reform.

887
01:17:59,891 --> 01:18:04,328
He runs rehab seminars in all
the prisons in this area.

888
01:18:04,572 --> 01:18:07,563
Here's a list of the cons
that took it in San Quentin.

889
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:10,849
Bobby Maxell never missed a session.

890
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,246
- You wait here.
- Wait.

891
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:16,406
The new ransom tape
said "Fessenheim" again.

892
01:18:16,653 --> 01:18:18,132
What does that mean?

893
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:22,652
Last year two bombs blew at a
nuclear plant in Fessenheim, France.

894
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:25,654
How about that.

895
01:18:34,695 --> 01:18:36,209
The body of Christ.

896
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:41,930
The body of Christ.

897
01:18:46,378 --> 01:18:48,130
The body...

898
01:18:48,698 --> 01:18:50,417
Remember me, Father?

899
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:51,929
Yes.

900
01:18:52,459 --> 01:18:56,612
- What is it you want?
- To talk about Bobby Maxwell.

901
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,650
Then get a warrant.

902
01:19:17,623 --> 01:19:20,854
- Just a minute.
- I thought I made it clear to you.

903
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:23,664
I have nothing to say to you!

904
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:28,344
Why do you come here
and harass me in my church?

905
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,257
- Is that a confessional?
- You want to confess?

906
01:19:32,505 --> 01:19:35,065
You first!

907
01:19:37,026 --> 01:19:38,664
Where the hell's Maxwell?

908
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:40,823
God may forgive, but I...

909
01:19:41,268 --> 01:19:43,906
Why do you protect them?
Many have died.

910
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:47,458
Sacrifices have to be made!

911
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,866
- The people are at war!
- So am I!

912
01:19:51,428 --> 01:19:54,308
How dare you pull a gun
in the house of God.

913
01:19:54,549 --> 01:19:56,379
If you don't believe in the sanctity...

914
01:19:56,629 --> 01:19:59,541
I don't have time to argue
religion with you!

915
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:09,746
Look at her hands!
Look at her hands!

916
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:23,113
- There wasn't supposed to be killing.
- Is she dead?

917
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:31,867
I close my eyes to this.

918
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,467
Father in heaven, help.

919
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:38,470
You can't close your eyes anymore.

920
01:20:40,116 --> 01:20:42,073
Now where's Maxwell?

921
01:20:53,758 --> 01:20:55,635
Alcatraz.

922
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:57,272
A place to hole up.

923
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,759
It wouldn't do
any good to suggest...

924
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:04,879
Forget it.

925
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:10,749
<i>No communications
were received since...</i>

926
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:14,915
Nothing! You sure Wanda
got those tapes to the cops?

927
01:21:15,362 --> 01:21:18,512
Bobby, I don't know.

928
01:21:18,722 --> 01:21:21,396
I don't know.
I wasn't with her!

929
01:21:27,085 --> 01:21:29,473
- Lf you didn't think she...
- Shut up!

930
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:32,238
- What're you doing?
- Having some coffee.

931
01:21:45,926 --> 01:21:47,724
Get the hell out of here!

932
01:21:51,128 --> 01:21:54,040
Christ, man, get your ass out there!

933
01:22:50,457 --> 01:22:51,447
Lalo.

934
01:22:51,697 --> 01:22:54,166
Get the mayor, bring him in here.

935
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:06,310
I'll get the bar.
Get him out of there.

936
01:25:19,962 --> 01:25:21,078
Freeze!

937
01:25:22,643 --> 01:25:25,396
All right, let him go!
Let him go!

938
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:30,919
Move over there, Your Honor! Fine.

939
01:25:32,884 --> 01:25:36,672
Okay, now, I want you very slowly...

940
01:25:37,724 --> 01:25:39,601
...to put down the weapon...

941
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:42,918
...then on the deck and spread them.

942
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:46,557
Are you kidding me?

943
01:25:46,806 --> 01:25:50,924
Laugh at me, bastard,
and I'll shoot you where you stand.

944
01:26:01,888 --> 01:26:05,199
Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go!

945
01:26:05,488 --> 01:26:08,448
Let's get out of here. Now, speed!

946
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:11,403
Stay with me.

947
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,044
Hold it, hold it.

948
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:16,328
Just take it very easy.

949
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:21,485
You relax, do just as I say,
and I'll get you home, all right?

950
01:26:21,731 --> 01:26:24,120
- Yeah.
- Take it slow.

951
01:26:25,132 --> 01:26:26,532
Wait a minute.

952
01:26:27,733 --> 01:26:29,006
Here we go.

953
01:27:00,857 --> 01:27:02,290
Harry, look out!

954
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:25,579
Oh, Harry, I messed up.

955
01:27:25,822 --> 01:27:29,531
You did just fine, Kate.
I'll get you out of here.

956
01:27:32,863 --> 01:27:36,095
Don't concern yourself, Harry.

957
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:44,132
Get him.

958
01:27:50,586 --> 01:27:52,259
You can count on it.

959
01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:12,538
Maxwell!

960
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:25,946
You fucking fruit!

961
01:28:33,353 --> 01:28:34,341
Get up there!

962
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:40,306
Go on, move!

963
01:28:52,956 --> 01:28:54,947
Karl! Tex!

964
01:28:56,356 --> 01:28:57,836
Karl!

965
01:29:01,036 --> 01:29:02,437
Oh, God!

966
01:29:41,244 --> 01:29:44,520
Callahan, you saved my life.

967
01:29:45,765 --> 01:29:49,599
I can't thank you.
I can't tell you...

968
01:29:49,845 --> 01:29:53,964
There'll be a letter of commendation
there for you.

969
01:30:07,648 --> 01:30:09,843
Callahan! Callahan!

970
01:30:12,568 --> 01:30:14,241
The chopper's here.

971
01:30:14,969 --> 01:30:17,688
Don't you want a ride?

972
01:30:51,175 --> 01:30:52,369
<i>Maxwell...</i>

973
01:30:52,775 --> 01:30:56,735
<i>...Bobby Maxwell,
this is Captain McKay speaking!</i>

974
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:59,573
<i>We have your money.</i>

975
01:31:00,176 --> 01:31:03,010
<i>The plane's waiting at the airport.</i>

976
01:31:03,857 --> 01:31:06,894
<i>We have acceded to all your demands...</i>

977
01:31:07,498 --> 01:31:09,375
<i>...so release the mayor.</i>

978
01:31:10,178 --> 01:31:14,377
<i>The helicopter will
fly you and your men to safety.</i>
