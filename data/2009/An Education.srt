1
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,920
An Education

2
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,670
<i>Come on, girls.</i>

3
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
<i>Anybody?</i>

4
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,760
<i>Anybody else?</i>

5
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,170
Jenny. Again.

6
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,380
Isn’t it because Mr Rochester’s
blind?

7
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,900
Yes, Jenny.

8
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,660
I've got an English essay to do by
tomorrow morning.

9
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,610
Right.

10
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,100
So, the only sound I want to hear
coming through this ceiling

11
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,000
is the sound of sweat dripping onto
textbooks.

12
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,910
- Cello?
- No cello.

13
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,240
I thought we agreed that cello was
my interest or hobby?

14
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,780
Well, it already is your interest or
hobby.

15
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,780
So, when they ask you at your
Oxford interview,

16
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,580
“What's your interest or hobby?”
you can say, "the Cello"

17
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,370
and you won't be a lying. Look, you
don't have to practise a hobby.

18
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,970
A hobby is a hobby.

19
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,220
Can I stop going to the youth
orchestra, then?

20
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,020
No.

21
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,470
No, no. The youth orchestra is
a good thing.

22
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
That shows you're a joiner-inner.

23
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,710
Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined in.
So now I can stop.

24
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,860
No.

25
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,990
No. Well, that just shows the
opposite, don't you see?

26
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,600
No, that shows you're a rebel.
They don't want that at Oxford.

27
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,920
No. They don't want people who think
for themselves.

28
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,820
No, of course they don't.

29
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,480
Jenny.

30
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,820
Shall I wear, like, Sunday best?

31
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,350
You'd better, I'm afraid.

32
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,530
Just to show my father you're
un jeune homme serieux,

33
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,980
not a teddy boy.

34
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,540
Oh, God. Right.

35
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,150
I need to go. It'll bucket down in
a minute.

36
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
All right...

37
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,590
I'll see you at the weekend.

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,440
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

39
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,420
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Bye.

40
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,390
Good bye, my love.

41
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,970
Come on. Come on.

42
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,220
Stop it, now! Stop it!

43
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,160
Oh, no. Look, what you've done.

44
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,150
The nice man's waiting for us.
- It fell off.

45
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,840
?

46
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,810
My socks are wet.

47
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,930
Hello.

48
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,400
Look.

49
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,640
If you've got any sense, you wouldn't
take a lift from a strange man.

50
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,330
But I'm a music lover, and I'm
worried about your cello. So...

51
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,030
What I propose is, you put it in
my car and walk alongside me.

52
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,760
How do I know you won't just
drive off with the cello?

53
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,110
Good point.

54
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,150
How much does a new cello cost?
Ten? Fifteen pounds? I don't know.

55
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,580
Let's say fifteen.

56
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,150
No? All right.

57
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,850
Up to you.

58
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,960
Thank you.

59
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,630
And that.

60
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,820
- I'm David, by the way.
- Jenny. - Very good.

61
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,790
How did the concert go?

62
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,790
It was a rehearsal. The concert's
next Thursday.

63
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,990
- What are you playing?
- Elgar.

64
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,470
I think it's a shame he spent so much
time in Worcester, don't you?

65
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800
Worcester's too near Birmingham.
And you can hear that in the music.

66
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,850
There's a terrible Brummy accent in
there, if you listen hard enough.

67
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,490
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews don't mix
very well.

68
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm not a Jew!

69
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,510
No. I am.

70
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,800
I wasn't accusing you.

71
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,040
Can I sit in the car with my cello?

72
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,690
Jump in.

73
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,850
Oh, thank you.

74
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,500
I've never seen a car like this
before. C'est tres chic.

75
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,950
It's a Bristol. Not many of 'em
made.

76
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,900
Where to, madam?

77
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,220
Jenny live round the corner.
Worst luck!

78
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,250
I'll see, what I can do.

79
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,890
I suppose cellists must go to a
lot of concerts.

80
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,420
We don't go to any concerts. We
don't believe in them.

81
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, they're real.

82
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,680
So people say.

83
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,370
Smoke?

84
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,980
I'd best not. I live just up there.

85
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,370
- Why don't we believe in them?
- He'd say there's no point to them.

86
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,670
- Your father, this is?
- Oh, yes.

87
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,670
They're just for fun.

88
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,800
Apart from school concerts,
which are no fun at all,

89
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,350
so we go to those.

90
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,000
They don't help you get on.

91
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,970
Which of course is what is so
wonderful about them.

92
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,710
Anyway, you'll go one day.

93
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,110
I know. I will.

94
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,610
If I get to University,

95
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,610
I'm going to read what I want, and
listen to what I want,

96
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,110
and I'm going to look at paintings
and watch French films,

97
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,410
and I'm gonna talk to people who
know lots about lots.

98
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,880
- Good for you.
- Yes.

99
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,780
Which University?

100
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,080
Oxford. If I'm lucky.

101
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,470
Did you go anywhere?

102
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,450
I studied at what I believe they
call the University of Life.

103
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,000
I didn't get a very good degree
there.

104
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,510
Well, thank you for driving me home.

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,440
# Sous le ciel de Paris #

106
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,590
You alright? You got it?

107
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,820
# S'envole une chanson #

108
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,990
Yes, it's fine.

109
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,380
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

110
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
# Elle est née d'aujourd'hui
Dans le coeur d'un garçon #

111
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,160
# Sous le ciel de Paris
Marchent les amoureux #

112
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,350
# Leur bonheur se construit
Sur une air fait pour eux #

113
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,440
# Sous le pont de Bercy
Un philosophe assis #

114
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,840
# Deux musiciens, quelques badauds
Puis des gens par milliers #

115
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,960
# Sous le ciel de Paris... #

116
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,560
<i>I don't want to hear any French
singing.</i>

117
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,700
<i>French singing wasn't on the
syllabus, last time I looked.</i>

118
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,800
- Battenburg?
- Oh, thank you.

119
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,450
?

120
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,500
<i>So, where are you applying, Graham?</i>

121
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,000
<i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

122
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,460
When will you be sure?

123
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,190
You can't let the grass grow under
your feet, young man.

124
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,040
I might take a year off.

125
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,430
What for?

126
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,220
?

127
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,010
Maybe do some travelling. Yeah. That
sort of thing.

128
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,980
Travelling? What are you, a teddy
boy?

129
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,510
You know she's going to Oxford,
don't you?

130
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,570
If we can get her Latin up to
scratch.

131
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,320
So while she's studying English at
Oxford,

132
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,890
you'll be the wandering Jew.

133
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,710
Mr. Mellor, I'm not a teddy boy.
I'm an homme serieux. Jeune.

134
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,440
<i>Um... No... Yeah.</i>

135
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,870
An homme jeune serieux homme.

136
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,320
- They're for me!
- Who are they from?

137
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,090
Gosh. Him.

138
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,450
What's this?

139
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,420
Jack, I’m afraid, Jenny has been
sent some flowers from a chap.

140
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,670
- A chap? What kind of chap?
- He's wishing me luck for tonight.

141
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,290
Is that all he's wishing you? Where
he get the money from?

142
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,500
He earns it, I expect.

143
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,450
Earns it? Why isn't he at school?

144
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,950
Um... Can we just go?

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,990
Otherwise the good-luck flowers will
actually be responsible for me

146
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,890
actually missing the concert. Which
would be ironic, n'est ce pas?

147
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,690
I don't like it.

148
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,620
Objection noted. Jenny?

149
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,660
Noted.

150
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,550
It's going to be ten bob's worth of
luck here.

151
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,130
I mean, that's a bit much for
a schoolgirl, isn't it?

152
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,860
We can't leave it here.

153
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,120
I mean, I'd burgle a house with
flowers left outside.

154
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,830
They’ll think we’re made of money.

155
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
Thank you, Marjorie.

156
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,520
<i>Camus doesn't want you to like him.
Feeling is bourgeois.</i>

157
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,860
<i>Being engagee is bourgeois.</i>

158
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,550
He kills someone and he doesn't feel
anything.

159
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,540
His mother dies and he doesn't feel
anything.

160
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,550
I wouldn't feel anything if my
mother died.

161
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
Does that make me an existentialist?

162
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,380
No. That makes you a cow.

163
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,680
Une vache.

164
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,870
Well, after I've been to University,
I'm going to be French,

165
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,050
and I'm going to Paris, and I'm
going to smoke and wear black,

166
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,710
and listen to Jacques Brel,
and I won't speak. Ever.

167
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,720
C'est plus chic comme-ça.

168
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,080
- Oh, cranky!
- What?

169
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,080
Wait here.

170
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,660
Hello.

171
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,560
Hello?

172
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,510
Hello. Thank you.

173
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,440
How did it go?

174
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,700
Oh, fine. I think. Well, I didn't
mess my bit up.

175
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,780
Nobody got thrown out of the
orchestra afterwards.

176
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,280
Always the mark of a cultural
triumph.

177
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,930
Listen. I'm glad I ran into you.
What are you doing on Friday?

178
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,580
- Going to school.
- I meant the evening.

179
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,320
Of course. Nothing.

180
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,580
Because I’m going to listen to some
Ravel at St John’s Smith Square.

181
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,480
My friends Danny and Helen will be
going too, so it wouldn't be...

182
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,780
I'll tell you what.

183
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,390
I'll come and pick you up, if your
mother and father disapprove,

184
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
then you can have the tickets and go
with one of them.

185
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,530
How does that sound?
- Thank you.

186
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,780
And I'd like you to go with you.

187
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,250
Seven?

188
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,630
All right.

189
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,210
And... Um...

190
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,160
We'll probably go for a spot of
supper afterwards.

191
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,160
Supper.

192
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,160
If you want to.

193
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,030
But the thing is, we'll probably
have eaten.

194
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Well. If you'd like supper, then,
perhaps on Friday you could...

195
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,170
not eat.

196
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,410
Yes. Of course.

197
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,800
- A spot of supper?
- You've heard of supper?

198
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,620
<i>We've heard of it. But we've never
eaten it.</i>

199
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,310
<i>So, you're going to have to tell us
everything.</i>

200
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,310
<i>Otherwise it's not fair.</i>

201
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,340
I won't allow it! - Fine. He's more
then happy for you to take me.

202
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,640
Fine. I will.

203
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,200
- Good.
- Well. Where is it?

204
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,090
- St John’s Smith Square.
- Where's that?

205
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,620
I don't know. I'm sure we could find
out.

206
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,070
It's in Westminster. Right next door
to the Abbey.

207
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,290
How d'you know that?

208
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,690
I had a life before we were married,
you know. He soon put a stop to that.

209
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,720
- There we are.
- Where are we?

210
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,440
We're near Westminster Abbey. I'm
not going all the way over there.

211
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,850
The trouble is, that's where
St John's Smith Square is.

212
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,170
Oh, come on. There must be something
on locally. Where's the paper?

213
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,990
She wants to see someone who can
play.

214
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,870
She doesn't want to see Sheila
Kirkland scratching away.

215
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,650
I'll take her.

216
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,850
And how do you propose to get there?
RAF Helicopter?

217
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,330
- That's him. - Oh, bloody hell.
- Jack!

218
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,330
Oh, by the way... David's a Jew.
A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.

219
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,450
What she mean by that? I've never
said anything like that!

220
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,300
It's just an expression! Look, I've
got nothing against the Jews!

221
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,340
Glad to hear it. Hello.

222
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,680
No. I didn't mean I've got nothing
against you...

223
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,830
No. Of course. I do mean that. - Dad?
- It's not... Sorry. It's just...

224
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,780
You're not the sort of person that
I'd be against. But I wouldn't,

225
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,230
because I'm not that kind of person
who would be against... people.

226
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,270
I'm Jack, this is my wife, Marjorie.

227
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,800
You didn’t tell me you had a sister,
Jenny.

228
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,070
Please.

229
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,620
You're a lucky man, Jack.

230
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
Yes, I suppose I am.

231
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,390
This is lovely.

232
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,790
Thank you.

233
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,690
I'm sorry, David. Would you like a
drink?

234
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,930
I'd love one, Jack, but we're
running a little late.

235
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,660
If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll
shoot off.

236
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,410
Actually, David, Dad has something
he has to tell you.

237
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,390
No, really. It was just a question.
A point of reference.

238
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,140
What's the best way to get to
St John’s Smith Square from here?

239
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,660
It's a straight run, really. Up to
Hammersmith,

240
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,670
take the A4 through Kensington and
you’re there.

241
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,020
- Simple as that.
- Simple as that.

242
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,230
So, I book us some tickets.

243
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,810
No--- But have her back by ten,
David.

244
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,060
I was hoping she might come with me
afterwards for a stop of supper

245
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,660
with my aunt Helen.

246
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,970
Oh, well, I...

247
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,320
No, no, um...

248
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,270
She's usually in bed by then.

249
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,720
What if I promise that to have her
back by eleven thirty?

250
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,150
Well, it’s Friday night. And you're
going all the way to the West End...

251
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,730
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.

252
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,330
All right.

253
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,970
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

254
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,530
Have a nice time.

255
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,790
Come.

256
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,040
Hello hello.

257
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,510
Are we late?

258
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,760
No. I thought we were gonna miss the
beginning, and then it wouldn’t be

259
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,290
worth going in, and we could go off
dancing or something.

260
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,170
Helen is one of the more reluctant
members of tonight’s audience.

261
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,840
- Hello. - Hello. - Jenny, these are
my friends Helen and Danny.

262
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,940
Shall we?

263
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,110
All right.

264
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,010
Sorry.

265
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,610
That's alright. It's lovely, isn't
it?

266
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,310
It's beautiful. Where did you get it
from?

267
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,410
Oh, I even don't know, Chelsea
somewhere...

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,950
Oh, yours is... Well, good for this
sort of concert, isn’t it?

269
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,910
Thank you.

270
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,470
We should go shopping together one
day, you know, if you want.

271
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,730
That would be nice. But Chelsea...
C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.

272
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,110
Sorry?

273
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,680
I just said, it's too expensive for
me.

274
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,940
No you didn't. You said something
completely different.

275
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,820
No. Well, I said it in French.

276
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,420
In French? Why?

277
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,090
I don't know.

278
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,000
Well. Chelsea is too expensive for
me, too, really.

279
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,230
But we don't have to worry about
that.

280
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,760
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

281
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,410
Why would David want to take me
shopping?

282
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,230
I booked a table at Juliette's. Will
that kill the mood, do you think?

283
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,580
Oh, I hope so.

284
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,680
God, I always think I'm going to my
own funeral

285
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,980
when I listen to classical music.

286
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,880
That was classical, wasn't it?

287
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,420
Yes. Very classical. As classical as
you can get.

288
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,660
Juliette's it is, then. Heaven forbid
that we should end the evening

289
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,910
reflecting on our own mortality.

290
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,770
# I want a Sunday kind of love #

291
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
# A love to last past Saturday
night #

292
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,260
?

293
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,890
Extraordinary woman, Greco. Just
like here Helen.

294
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,470
What about "Chante Francoise Sagan?"
Have you heard about that one?

295
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,090
Wonderful.

296
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,880
I've only got... Well, I think it's
just called "Juliette Greco."

297
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,780
The one with the eyes on the sleeve.

298
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,510
I saved up and got my French
conversation teacher

299
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,930
to bring it back after Christmas.

300
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,560
- You've got a French conversation
teacher? - Yes.

301
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,760
Is that why you suddenly speak
French for no reason?

302
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,110
Never heard her sing? She's
marvellous.

303
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,690
You should see her in Paris, not
here. David will take you.

304
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,430
I'd love to. You'd fit right in.

305
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,920
Better than here, really.

306
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,260
Isn't it wonderful to find a young
person wants to know things.

307
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,610
There's so much I want you to see.

308
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,900
Are you all right to come and have
a look at that Pembroke Villas place

309
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,320
with me on Friday, Danny?

310
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,770
Oh, no. I can't.

311
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,150
There’s a Burne-Jones coming up at
Christie’s on Friday.

312
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,560
Desperate to get my hands on it.

313
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,060
You're thinking of buying a
Burne-Jones? A real one?

314
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,030
I just have a feeling that the pre-
Raphaelites are going to take off.

315
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,960
I love the pre-Raphaelites.

316
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,780
- Do you?
- Yes, of course.

317
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,350
Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway.
Not Holman Hunt, so much.

318
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
He's so garish.
- Oh, absolutely!

319
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,780
Well, why don't we all go to the
auction together?

320
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,980
Auction? Gosh! How exciting!

321
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,950
Next Friday morning.

322
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,160
Friday. Oh.

323
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,490
You're busy?

324
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,880
Oh, yes.

325
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,090
Tant pis.

326
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,970
Pas de probleme.

327
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,810
Are you sure you're busy?

328
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,860
No. I'm sure I could re-arrange.
That would be lovely.

329
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:19,880
# You got me wrapped around your
little finger #

330
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:28,520
# If this is Love, it's everything
I hoped it would be #

331
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:43,590
# When we kiss, It's as if our lips
agree #

332
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,730
# that we were meant to be #

333
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,830
# When we touch... #

334
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,950
What are you doing?

335
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,650
I can't get this casserole dish
clean. It’s all burnt round...

336
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,380
It's twenty-five to twelve.

337
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,980
We finish tea at seven.

338
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,880
I know what the time is.

339
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,700
How was your evening?

340
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,310
Best night of my life.

341
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,570
Night, mum.

342
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,020
There were like two violins, one
cello, two violas, a harp.

343
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,850
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

344
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,790
I want to know what else was on the
programme.

345
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,120
There was nothing like that. He was
the perfect gentleman.

346
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,470
He just said he wanted to take me
places and show me things.

347
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,620
- Things.
- Plural? Oh my Gawd!

348
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,480
I knew that "Jane Eyre" would
eventually work its magic upon you.

349
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,680
I'm presuming that's what you're so
animated about.

350
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,810
Of course. "Jane Eyre" and Jenny's
new boyfriend.

351
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,300
He's not my “new boyfriend”.

352
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,130
It's true. He's more a man-friend,
actually?

353
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,060
He's got a sports-car, Miss Stubbs.
- It's Maroon.

354
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,770
So, could we call him Mr. Rochester
figure.

355
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,620
I think he must be as blind as
Mr. Rochester.

356
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,130
You may have noticed, I'm trying
to stir the subject away

357
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,000
from Jenny's lurid love-life and into
the matter in hand.

358
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,650
This is clear from this evidence
that most of you know further much

359
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,300
about the former, and next to nothing
about the latter.

360
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,930
Reluctantly I have to admitt that
Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

361
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,930
Excellent as always, Jenny.

362
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,460
Any further bids?

365
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,210
<i>Sold then for sixty guineas.</i>

366
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,160
Hello.

367
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
You're late.

368
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,190
<i>We now turn to lot 41,</i>

369
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,490
<i>The Tree of Forgiveness, by Sir
Edward Burne-Jones.</i>

370
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,670
This is a rare opportunity to
purchase a key work

371
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,790
of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

372
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,640
<i>Who will start me off at one hundred
guineas? - Is it that One?</i>

373
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,290
Yes. That's the one.

374
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,220
<i>Fifty guineas?</i>

375
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,100
Twenty guineas?

376
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,040
Thank you.

377
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,270
<i>Fourty?</i>

378
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,070
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

379
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,970
Do I hear sixty?
- ?

380
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,820
Eighty guineas?

381
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,490
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

382
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,080
Another one, madame? One hundred
guineas?

383
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,880
One hundred and twenty?

384
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,920
No further bids?

385
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,150
- Your turn.
- What?

386
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
- Any further bids?
- ?

387
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,870
- Anymore?
- Quick.

388
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,110
One hundred and twenty guineas for
the very eager new bidder.

389
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,170
<i>One hundred and forty, madam?</i>

390
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,990
Thank you.

391
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,140
One hundred and sixty guineas?

392
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,740
<i>One hundred and eighty? Thank you.</i>

393
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,100
Two hundred guineas?

394
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,730
<i>Two hundred and twenty?</i>

395
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,310
Another one, madam?

396
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,170
Sold for two hundred guineas.

397
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

398
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,840
Your name, please.

399
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,350
Mellor.

400
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,840
Now we move on to lot 42.

401
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,850
Thank you very much. I couldn’t
possible bought it without you.

402
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,320
<i>Just a couple of years ago you could
pick one of those up for fifty quid.</i>

403
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,070
<i>No one was interested. - Oh, I would
have been so interested.</i>

404
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,220
<i>As you can see, I just love things.</i>

405
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,010
That's not a Lockey-Hill!

406
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,170
There aren't many people who come
in here and say that.

407
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,020
- No. Certainly not me.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

408
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,110
- Do you play?
- Thank you.

409
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,870
<i>I used to. I vowed to myself that
one day I'd own one of these.</i>

410
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,750
<i>And now I do and I won't even touch
the bugger.</i>

411
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,200
It's vulgar, putting it on display.

412
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,810
Give it to Jenny.

413
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,990
I think, that would be even more
vulgar.

414
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,190
<i>Play for us, Jenny.</i>

415
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,470
No, no. One day. When I'm good
enough.

416
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,010
<i>She's good enough now.</i>

417
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,310
David, you've never seen me play.

418
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,580
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

419
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,710
We should all go and spend a
weekend in Oxford.

420
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,470
Straw boaters, punting, cream teas,

421
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,660
antiquarian bookshops.
- Boats?

422
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,750
Bit of business, if we can find it.
What about next weekend?

423
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,570
Yes.

424
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,750
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

425
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,710
I'll talk to them.

426
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,230
You're going to ask my father if you
can take me away for the weekend?

427
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,730
He'd have you arrested.
- We'll see.

428
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,710
- I bet you can't.
- How much?

429
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,890
<i>I'd be careful if I were you,
Jenny.</i>

430
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,530
You don't know who you're dealing
with.

431
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,830
Half-a-crown.

432
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,830
You're on.

433
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,140
How do you know Danny?

434
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,540
Oh, you know. We kept bumping into
each other, and we became pals,

435
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,440
ended up doing a bit of business
together, when it suits us.

436
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,190
What kind of business?

437
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,480
Property. A bit of art dealing.

438
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,270
Some buying and selling. This and
that...

439
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,450
Alright, just be two ticks.
- Okay.

440
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,480
<i>?</i>

441
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,150
<i>?</i>

442
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,890
<i>?</i>

443
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,290
<i>Mr. Goldman, good to see you.</i>

444
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,700
<i>?</i>

445
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,940
<i>Madam.</i>

446
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,620
<i>All right.</i>

447
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,650
<i>Hey.</i>

448
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
<i>All right. I got this one.
And... Um...</i>

449
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,410
<i>Go on, then.</i>

450
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,280
Sorry about that.

451
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,630
How do you know those negro people?

452
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,080
They're clients.

453
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Clients?

454
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,320
Schwarzers have to live somewhere.

455
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,670
It's not as if they can rent off
their own kind, is it?

456
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,010
Test results for the Virgil
translation.

457
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,320
We'll start from the bottom.

458
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,100
<i>Patricia. Absent.</i>

459
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,600
Margaret. 48%.

460
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,150
Jenny. 52%.

461
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,430
That would just about scrape a pass
in the exam proper.

462
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,190
Not good enough for Oxford
candidates.

463
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,710
It’s her Latin, isn’t it?

464
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,060
Everyone’s doing their best, Jack.

465
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,680
But what if everyone's best isn’t
good enough? What do we do then?

466
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,500
<i>Well. Perhaps the whole thing’s been
a waste of money anyway.</i>

467
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,510
<i>You don’t mean that.</i>

468
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,150
<i>What’s she going to do with an
English degree?</i>

469
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,930
And if she’s going to spend three
years playing that bloody cello,

470
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,260
talking in French to a bunch of
beatniks,

471
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,110
Well, I’m just throwing good money
after bad.

472
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,280
Well, she might meet a nice lawyer.

473
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,240
She could do that at a dinner dance
tomorrow.

474
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,380
That’s the point of an Oxford
education, isn't it dad?

475
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,110
It’s the expensive alternative to
a dinner dance.

476
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,110
What about private tuition?

477
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,310
Can anybody hear me? How much is
this going to cost me?

478
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,870
<i>Five shillings an hour. Maybe a
little more for A-level.</i>

479
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,730
Five bob! Oh, we spend five bob
here, we spend five bob there,

480
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,480
next thing you know that’s our
savings down the drain.

481
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,180
And what else are we spending five
bob on?

482
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,880
<i>What else are we spending six pence
on?</i>

483
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,340
Oh, nothing. No, nothing. All of
this is free.

484
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,890
This vase is free.

485
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,020
It was, actually. It was a present
from Auntie Vi.

486
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,430
That chair. This sofa. It's all
free.

487
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,930
We don’t have to pay for any of it.

488
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,460
You see, that's the beauty of life,
Jenny.

489
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,220
<i>You don't have to pay for anything.</i>

490
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,150
You know, there's a lovely Oxford
tree growing in the garden,

491
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,700
lucky for you, because that’s Oxford
taken care of.

492
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,080
And there's a whole orchard of
school trees,

493
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,200
so that’s school is free.

494
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,810
And I think there's even a private
tuition tree in there.

495
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,690
I'll just go and check, shall I?
- Jack?

496
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,810
<i>That's all right, Marjorie. Don't
worry. It'll only be a second.</i>

497
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,270
Because I think there's a whole clump
of them

498
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,620
surrounding the pocket money tree.

499
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,900
I'll just go make sure, they're all
nice and safe, shall I?

500
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,380
Oh, by the way, you might be lucky,
there might be a man

501
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,140
with deep pockets growing out there.

502
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,740
Because God know, you gonna need one.

503
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,210
You could always take secretarial
college with Hattie.

504
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,100
- Oh, thanks.
- Charming.

505
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
Oh, God, no.

506
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
<i>Hello.</i>

507
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,040
Hello. Graham.

508
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,430
Haven’t seen you in ages!

509
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,520
It all went wrong, didn’t it?
The tea-party, I mean.

510
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,950
Was it because of the year off
thing? Because I...

511
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,750
No.

512
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,350
I just have so much work to do if
I’m going to get the grades I need.

513
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,420
Yeah. She’s got no time for boys.

514
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,180
- Bye, Graham.
- Bye.

515
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,130
<i>Yes.</i>

516
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,050
<i>?</i>

517
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,240
<i>?</i>

518
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,110
<i>?</i>

519
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,110
<i>?</i>

520
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,830
- Oh, you do all the Goons.
- No, my Eccles is no good.

521
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,280
- Oh, no, you've got him.
- No. No.

522
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,040
<i>?</i>

523
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,090
Hello.

524
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,770
Oh, Jenny.

525
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,140
David does the most fantastic
Bluebottle.

526
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,720
You came to see my parents?

527
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,740
Oh, why is that so hard to imagine?

528
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,440
Why are you drinking?

529
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,290
It's not Christmas!

530
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,160
Oh, there's a lot of you don’t know
about us, young lady.

531
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,830
We had a life before you came along.

532
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,040
That’s true.

533
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,150
I’m only going on what I’ve seen for
the last sixteen years.

534
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,020
I’m trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

535
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,650
Right.

536
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,330
Anyway. I’ve got a huge pile of
Latin translation to do.

537
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,930
You didn’t tell us David went to
Oxford.

538
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,790
No. I didn’t.

539
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,620
For all the good it did me.

540
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,020
- Isn’t that funny?
- Extraordinary.

541
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,590
I was just telling Jack that I’m
going back next weekend.

542
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,910
I go and visit my old English
professor every now and again.

543
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,610
See, that’s what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

544
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,620
It’s not always what you know, is
it, David?

545
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,320
Too true. Did you come across Clive
Lewis?

546
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,830
Dad's never come across anyone.

547
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,130
He wrote a children’s book called

548
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,290
"The Lion, The Witch and The
Wardrobe"

549
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,370
that did very well, I believe.

550
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,480
CS Lewis?

551
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,020
Well, to us he was just the old
codger

552
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,410
who taught Medieval literature but
I came to know him very well.

553
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,230
We just... got along.

554
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,540
Jenny used to devour those books.

555
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,750
I’d love to meet him.

556
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,330
I’m sorry. I’m being slow on the
uptake.

557
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,140
<i>Would Jenny like to come at the
weekend?</i>

558
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,770
No. Not this weekend. But sometimes,
perhaps... Yes.

559
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,730
How often do you see him?

560
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,980
Not very often. Every couple of
years.

561
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,330
Maybe next time.

562
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,600
Well, I suppose...

563
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,930
Would she have to stay the night?

564
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,930
I wouldn’t recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

565
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,280
Clive could get her a room in the
college. That’s easy enough.

566
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,000
Seems like too good an opportunity
to pass up.

567
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,810
It wouldn't be a bother, would it,
David?

568
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,110
# We walk along hand in hand #

569
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Come on!

570
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,030
<i>Just putting a few things into the
bag. Don't worry.</i>

571
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,580
# Yeah, we both understand #

572
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,230
# Mm, sweet nothings #

573
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,730
Come on!

574
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,240
We're nearly ready. Be there in two
ticks.

575
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,020
How can they only be nearly
ready?

576
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,700
I wouldn’t be surprised if three of
them come out then.

577
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,310
The only explanation. They’re making
themselves a friend.

578
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,260
Ladies! Come on! Let’s go.

579
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,720
There. Have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

580
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,370
You should keep that one, if you
want it.

581
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,230
I can only wear so many one day.

582
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,380
<i>Thank you.</i>

583
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,410
What about tonight? We got to put on
a nightie.

584
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,720
I thought I'd share a room with you?

585
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,720
You haven't slept with him?

586
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
No.

587
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,160
Good for you.

588
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,360
Really? Do you think so?

589
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,430
Yes. Well, you’re only sixteen. You
don’t want to get pregnant, do you?

590
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,280
No. I wouldn't let that happen.

591
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,460
I want to wait until I’m seventeen.

592
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,330
<i>On my seventeenth birthday,
hopefully.</i>

593
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,530
With David?

594
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,440
Golly. It will be with David, won’t
it?

595
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,080
<i>If that’s what you want.</i>

596
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,330
Anyway. I’ll find you a nightie.

597
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Ta-daa!

598
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,310
Shall we make a move?

599
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:25,920
# You got me wrapped around your
little finger #

600
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:34,340
# If this is love, it's everything
I hoped it would be #

601
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,090
Can we get off and have a look
around?

602
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,170
Later. If we have time

603
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,820
Imagine spending three years here.

604
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,820
I know.

605
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,310
<i>Take a bow. It's all about...</i>

606
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,980
<i>Why university girls are
strange-looking?</i>

607
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,430
They can’t all have started off that
way, can they?

608
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,700
I mean, most girls aren’t born ugly,
but most girl students seem to be.

609
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,500
So there must be something about
these places

610
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,540
that make you fat, or spotty, or
short-sighted.

611
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,440
Well, when you look at it like
that...

612
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,800
I mean, that’s proper scientific
analysis.

613
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,900
You can’t argue with science.

614
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,120
I still not quite understand what
you want to do when you get here.

615
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,920
I want to read English.

616
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,950
Books?

617
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:26,960
Sorry?

618
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,160
You want to read English books?

619
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,325
Reading English is just another way
of saying...

620
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,770
Don't worry, Jenny. You’re wasting
your breath.

621
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,500
Anyway, tomorrow we’ll get more of
a feel for the place.

622
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,150
Absolutely. This place would be good
for a little business.

623
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,990
All of those little old ladies
wandering around...

624
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,120
- Old Ladies?
- This place is rife with stats.

625
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,970
Please explain what stats are.
You’re always going on about them.

626
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,780
- It isn't very interesting.
- But you two are interested.

627
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,870
It's because we're not very
interesting either.

628
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,620
- Oh, no. They're not, really.
- True.

629
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,230
So we have an idiot here, to save us
from ourselves.

630
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,410
Yeah. To put some intelligence and
culture into our brutal lives.

631
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,640
Sing to us! Sing to us1

632
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,990
Please, don't make me sing to you.

633
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,710
Please don't make us talk about
work.

634
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,660
So. Now. Is he Clive, do you think?
Or CS?

635
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,830
I’m confused now. I thought you’d
made him up?

636
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,930
No, we...

637
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,800
Never mind.

638
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,100
“To dear Jenny. With the pleasure
of meeting you."

639
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,720
"Come and see me again soon. Clive.”

640
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,530
Dirty old man.

641
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,030
Bad girl.

642
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,070
We've got these exact same curtains
at home.

643
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,510
Let’s not talk about curtains.

644
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,100
You look beautiful.

645
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
David...

646
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,530
There’s something you should know.

647
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:10,570
I’m a virgin. And I want to stay
that way until I’m seventeen.

648
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,240
I think that’s good. I think that’s
right.

649
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,710
We can still be romantic, can’t we?

650
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,810
Yes, of course. As long as it's not
actually.

651
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,680
Minnie...

652
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,320
Is that me?

653
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:46,870
Yes. You’re my Minnie Mouse, and
I’m your bubbalub.

654
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,660
Okay. If that's what you want to do.

655
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,960
- Minnie.
- Yes, David?

656
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,170
Bubbalub...

657
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,100
Bubbalub?

658
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,560
May I have a look? Just a peek?

659
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,610
You just want to see them?

660
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,020
Thank you.

661
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,470
I think there's a house for sale
around here.

662
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
Really?

663
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,950
Might be worth a look.

664
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,810
?

665
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Jenny...

666
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,520
- Aren’t you coming?
- We don’t go in.

667
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,180
What are you talking about?

668
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,730
Why don't you go and get a nice cup
of tea somewhere.

669
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,950
Helen will look after you.

670
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,460
I don’t need looking after, thank
you very much. David?

671
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,610
I’m not going to tell you a second
time. Run along.

672
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,190
They won’t be long. Either way.

673
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,600
"Either way?"

674
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,870
Well sometimes they find something,
and sometimes they don’t.

675
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,020
And when they do find something, we
often have to leave quite quickly.

676
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,600
They can be a quite naughty,
sometimes.

677
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,190
- Thank you. - Good bye. - Cheerio.
- Catch!

678
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,320
<i>Careful-careful-careful!</i>

679
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,190
Come on.

680
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,910
Helen.
- Pass the ball.

681
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,290
Good.

682
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
Jenny!

683
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,190
What? - You can stand there, if you
like. But I won't recommend it.

684
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,260
Coo-ee. Jenny.

685
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,740
Sorry about being a little brisk
back there, Jenny.

686
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,250
It's just the way we do things.
Silly, really.

687
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,530
Hey, don't forget your case.

688
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,640
- Who's coming up for a drink?
- Me? No.

689
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,990
You go. I’ll make my own way home.

690
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Jenny?

691
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Jenny!

692
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,820
It's an old map. A Speed.

693
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,360
Poor dear didn’t even know what it
was.

694
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,030
It's a waste. It shouldn’t spend
its life on a wall in...

695
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,750
wherever the hell we were.

696
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,900
It should be with us. We know how to
look after it properly.

697
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,950
We liberated it.
- Liberated?

698
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,410
That’s one word for it.

699
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,560
Don’t be bourgeois, Jenny. You’re
better than that.

700
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,180
You drink everything I put in front
of you down in one,

701
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,140
and you slam your glass down on the
bar and ask for more,

702
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,760
it’s wonderful.

703
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,790
We’re not clever like you, so we
have to be clever in other ways,

704
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,510
because if we weren’t, there would
be no fun.

705
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,450
We have to be clever with maps,
and...

706
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,270
You want to know what stats are?

707
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,620
Stats are old ladies who are scared
of coloured people.

708
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,130
So we move the coloureds in and the
old ladies move out

709
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,820
and I buy their flats cheap.

710
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,440
That’s what I do. So now you know.

711
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,940
And if you don’t like it,

712
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,570
I'll understand, and you can go back
to Twickenham

713
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:58,240
and listen to the Home Service and
do your Latin homework.

714
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,900
But these weekends, and the
restaurants and the concerts---

715
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,810
They don’t grow on trees.

716
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,530
This is who we are, Jenny.

717
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,430
Oh. - Oh. - That's nice.

718
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,050
- Come on, you two!
- Come on up!

719
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,540
You can have my olive.

720
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,910
Come on.

721
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,660
I suppose you have homework to do.

722
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,980
You have no idea how boring
everything was before I met you.

723
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,060
"Action is character", our English
teacher says.

724
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,670
I think it means that if we never
did anything,

725
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,470
we wouldn’t be anybody.

726
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,350
And I never did anything before
I met you.

727
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,340
And sometimes I think no one’s ever
done anything

728
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,740
in this whole stupid country, apart
from you.

729
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,380
Okay.
- All right.

730
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,210
There you go.

731
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,750
Good night.

732
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,530
Marjorie, look at this.

733
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,320
"Clive..." Lucky girl.

734
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,900
Never a dull moment with David, eh?

735
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,950
Better than the young man you
brought home for tea.

736
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,900
David’s a lot older than Graham.

737
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,710
Graham could live to be two hundred
years old,

738
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,350
you'll never see him swanning
around with famous authors.

739
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,630
Hasn’t got it in him.

740
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,610
Graham might become a famous author,
for all you know.

741
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,160
Becoming one isn’t the same as
knowing one.

742
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,270
That shows you're well connected.

743
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,760
Very impressive young man, your
David.

744
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,210
I must admitt, life is a little
brighter with him around.

745
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,230
<i>Come on girls. Get your moves on.</i>

746
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,390
<i>?</i>

747
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,200
<i>?</i>

748
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,930
What the hell are those?

749
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,480
Russian Sobranies.

750
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,050
Where did they come from?

751
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,610
She probably bought them from the
Savoy, or Claridges, or the opera,

752
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,460
or some fancy nightclub.

753
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,070
Who knows, with Jenny?

754
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,270
Paris. You can’t buy them here.

755
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,650
- You never bought them yourself?
- No. I never.

756
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,960
Oh, shut up, you stuck-up cow.

757
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,240
But I’ll bring you some back, if
you like.

758
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,410
- You’re joking?
- Non.

759
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,950
- He’s taking you to Paris?
- Oui.

760
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,060
- This term?
- Peut-etre.

761
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,720
Wait. Isn’t it your birthday next
Thursday?

762
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,110
Might be.

763
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,590
Oh, my God! Your birthday!

764
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:15,570
I would not like to be you. All
those suppers you’ve had off him.

765
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,470
Ouch.

766
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,570
You've such a Victorian attitude to
sex, you two.

767
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,410
Your parents wouldn't let you
swan off like that, would they?

768
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,060
They don’t know yet.

769
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,560
David will come up with some story.
He usually does.

770
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,180
Yeah. I’ve noticed that.

771
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,380
Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume.

772
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,090
Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick.

773
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,320
Those funny cigarettes you were
smoking. Sobranies.

774
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,820
Ten packets each.

775
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,810
How much is that Chanel perfume?

776
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,450
Oh, are you the girl going to Paris,
or are you not? Because...

777
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,900
Tina, top button.

778
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,890
Jenny, the headmistress wants a word
with you.

779
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,960
The legend of Mr. Rochester may have
travelled further than you intended.

780
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:00,980
Come.

781
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,210
Ah. Miss Mellor.

782
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,390
We’re all very excited about your
forthcoming trip to Paris.

783
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,340
Our excitement, indeed, knows no
bounds.

784
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,840
Some of us can talk of little else.
An older man, I understand.

785
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,760
A word of warning, Miss Mellor.

786
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,170
There may well have been the odd
sixth-form girl who has lost

787
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,030
an important part of herself---
perhaps the best part---

788
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,240
while under our supervision. These
things happen, regrettably.

789
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,150
If, however, we are made aware of
that loss,

790
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,210
then of course the young lady in
question

791
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,880
would have to continue her studies
elsewhere,

792
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,560
if she still has any use for
"A" levels.

793
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,410
Did I make myself clear?

794
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,960
- Can I go now?
- If you want.

795
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,360
What are you doing in there?

796
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,160
But I imagine she's lighting the
candles on my cake.

797
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,960
You're seventeen, not two hundred
and fifty.

798
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:17,390
- Thanks for inviting me. - That was
Marjorie's idea, not mine.

799
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,150
Not even Jenny's for that matter.
- Dad?

800
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,520
Cake!

801
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,900
Well. Blow them out before the house
burns down!

802
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,800
Okay--- Don't worry.

803
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,930
Bravo.

804
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,320
- Who'd like a piece?
- Me, please.

805
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,520
Come on! Come on! Presents!

806
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,840
Oops!

807
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,250
It's a new Latin dictionary.

808
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,800
Thank you. I needed a new one.

809
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,620
Oh dear.

810
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,070
Snap!

811
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,140
<i>Oh, good grief!</i>

812
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,520
<i>Jenny, you should see this.</i>

813
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,590
<i>it's a special day.</i>

814
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,990
<i>- She’s a special girl.
- I know it.</i>

815
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,840
Bit of help?

816
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,090
Makes your dictionary look
a bit feeble, eh, Graham?

817
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,990
Gosh!

818
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,310
These are for you--- Hello, young
man.

819
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,200
- Oh. David. - Hey, David, would you
like a drink?

820
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,750
I'd love one.

821
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:36,330
I’d best be going because I have a
stack of homework to do. So...

822
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,120
All right.

823
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,840
Thank you. Bye.

824
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,930
Cheers.

825
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,370
- Good bye, Mr. Mellor.
- Ah. See you, young man.

826
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,520
Thank you.

827
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,540
Wonderful to see you, Graham.

828
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,100
- Good bye, Jenny.
- Bye, Graham.

829
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,270
- Little something warming?
- You know me so well.

830
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,220
- Can I open anything yet?
- Wait for me.

831
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,440
Before you open that lot, I got
a surprise.

832
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,950
Next weekend, we’re all going to
Café de Flore

833
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,290
to celebrate Jenny’s birthday.

834
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,630
Ah. Lovely.

835
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,960
Café de Flore is on the boulevard
Saint-Germain. In Paris.

836
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,370
- What do you mean, Paris?
- You know the one, Dad.

837
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,280
No. No. No, no, no.

838
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,860
No. We don't have any French money.
And besides it's just...

839
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,720
Well. I don’t think it would agree
with me.

840
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,370
Dad!

841
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,320
The French don't like us, Jenny. You
know that.

842
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,120
John Sutton form work, he went there
last year.

843
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,470
They were very rude to him.

844
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,810
I don’t want to spoil anyone’s fun,
but it’s just not for me, Europe.

845
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,750
You'll have to go another time.

846
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,770
You’ve just said you don’t like
Europe.

847
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,020
So, what’s going to change?
It’ll have to be Europe, won’t it?

848
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,670
Because it certainly won't be you.

849
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,480
I'll take her.

850
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,350
- To the continent?
- Why not?

851
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,550
- And leave me here on my own?
- Oh, for God’s sake.

852
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,990
What do you think?

853
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,740
You know, what Jenny likes about
France, Jack?

854
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,170
French films, and books, and music.

855
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,150
Of course I do.

856
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,650
Sorry. Yes, 'cause without saying
she's your daughter.

857
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,120
Jenny likes the joke about how you're
the stick in the mud

858
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:20,620
and all the rest of it, but I know
that's not who you are.

859
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,650
Otherwise, she wouldn't be, who she
is.

860
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,650
No.

861
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,400
But I can also see that I've acted
out of turn and...

862
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,760
I'm sorry.

863
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,700
What about your Aunt Helen?

864
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,150
<i>An hour late.</i>

865
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,120
<i>We'll make it. I promise.</i>

866
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,160
<i>Okay. There's a flight at eight in
the morning.</i>

867
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,060
Good.

868
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,050
There’s no bed.

869
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,050
Ah. I pushed the boat out and got
us a suite.

870
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,100
A suite!

871
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,690
Well, if work stops us getting to
Paris until tomorrow,

872
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,190
then we can buy us a nice hotel room.

873
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,250
Anyway, it’s a special occasion,
isn’t it?

874
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,580
I would thought tonight of all
nights we only need a bed.

875
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,050
Hold on a second. I’ve got
something.

876
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,040
I thought we might practice with
this.

877
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,050
With a banana?

878
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,300
I thought we might get the messy bit
over with first.

879
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,260
David, I don’t want to lose my
virginity to a piece of fruit.

880
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,970
I’m sorry.

881
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,840
Okay.

882
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:35,950
I think the moment might have gone.
I think we should wait until Paris.

883
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,120
I’m sorry. Um... Minnie.

884
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,250
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

885
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,940
David, if tomorrow night does
happen,

886
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,390
it's only ever going to happen once.

887
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,230
Why will it only happen once?

888
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:57,370
Because the first time can only
happen once.

889
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:03,660
So, no baby-talk. No Minnie.

890
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,060
Just treat me like a grown-up, okay?

891
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,160
I know. Let’s go and sit in our
sitting-room.

892
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,600
All right.

893
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,970
Order some champagne.

894
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,160
Room service!

895
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,800
# Quand doucement tu te penches #

896
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,670
# En murmurant: "C'est dimanche, #

897
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,980
# Si nous allions en banlieue faire
un tour #

898
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,220
# Sous le ciel bleu des beaux
jours?" #

899
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,930
# Mille projets nous attirent, #

900
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,720
# Mais, dans un meme sourire, #

901
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,690
# Nous refaisons le trajet simple et
doux #

902
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,350
# De nos premiers rendez-vous... #

903
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:21,020
# Sur les quais du vieux Paris, #

904
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,500
# Le long de la Seine
Le bonheur sourit, #

905
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,410
# Sur les quais du vieux Paris, #

906
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:34,390
# L'amour se promene
En cherchant un nid. #

907
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:39,950
# Vieux bouquiniste,
Belle fleuriste #

908
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:44,420
# Comme on vous aime,
Vivant poeme ! #

909
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:48,550
# Sur les quais du vieux Paris, #

910
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:55,900
# De l'amour boheme
C'est le paradis... #

911
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,260
Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?

912
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,320
It wasn’t too uncomfortable?

913
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,100
Not after the first bit.

914
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,870
It’s funny, though, isn’t it?

915
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:33,360
All that poetry, and all those songs

916
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,050
about something that lasts no time
at all?

917
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,360
Yeah.

918
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,450
All your exercise books on my desk
in a pile, please.

919
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,910
I bought this for you.

920
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,660
That's very kind of you.

921
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,860
But I can't accept it.

922
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,030
Why not?

923
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,070
It’s because of people like you that
I plough through illiterate essays

924
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,320
by Sandra Lovell about her pony.

925
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,470
But I know where this comes from,
Jenny.

926
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:20,080
And If I took it, I'll feel like I'd
be betraying both of us.

927
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,550
Jenny.

928
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,250
You can do anything you want. You
know that.

929
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,480
You’re clever and you’re pretty...

930
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,680
Is your boyfriend interested in
clever Jenny?

931
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,290
I’m not quite sure what you’re
trying to tell me.

932
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,290
I’m telling you to go to Oxford. No
matter what.

933
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,940
'Cause if you don't, you’ll break my
heart.

934
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,030
Where did you go?

935
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,660
Cambridge.

936
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,420
Well. You’re clever. And you’re
pretty.

937
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,130
So presumably, Clever Miss Stubbs
won.

938
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,680
And here you are with your pony
essays.

939
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,900
I don't know. These last few months,
I’ve eaten in wonderful restaurants,

940
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,000
and went to jazz clubs, and watch
wonderful films,

941
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,270
heard beautiful music...

942
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,770
- Jenny, you're taking precautions.
- Nothing to do with that.

943
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,420
Isn’t it?

944
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:38,420
Maybe will our lives going to end up
with pony essays. Or housework.

945
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,630
And yes, maybe we’ll go to Oxford.

946
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,290
But if we’re all going to die
the moment we graduate,

947
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,940
Isn't it what we do before that
counts.

948
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,890
I’m sorry you think I’m dead.

949
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,810
I don’t think you’re dead. I just...

950
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,610
I think you’d better get to your
next class.

951
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,290
Well done, Jenny.

952
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,040
I haven't won anything before. Not
even at the raffle.

953
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,310
Oh, you've bet on the sweetest
looking one,

954
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,220
and he always comes last.

955
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,250
- Let's go. - Come on. - Oh, can we
do it again? I'm feeling lucky!

956
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,790
Come on. Let's go. I don't want to
miss him.

957
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,340
Pick up your 10 bob on your way out.
- I won ten shillings!

958
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:31,330
Who is this man, anyway?

959
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,880
- Peter Rachman.
- A complete bastard.

960
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,150
Why do you have to see him here?

961
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,400
Because he's not a sort of chap
with an office.

962
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,650
<i>- All right?
- Yeah.</i>

963
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,030
Ladies...

964
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:56,440
A bottle of your finest champagne,
please.

965
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,690
There he is.

966
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,820
Come on, Jenny. Tell them your good
news. Don’t be bashful.

967
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,300
No. Be Sneezy.

968
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,580
Jenny got two A's and a B in her
mock-A levels.

969
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,720
Like everyone else in this
sophisticated establishment.

970
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:13,220
The B was in Latin.

971
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,920
- Seriously. Congratulations.
- Excuse us.

972
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,040
Don’t worry too much.

973
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,420
About what?

974
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,530
Someone told me that in about fifty
years

975
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,400
no one will speak Latin, probably.

976
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,550
Not even Latin people. So don't
worry about your B.

977
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,330
He's even more of a bastard than
I thought!

978
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,410
You don't want him to marry your
sister.

979
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,510
Or want to talk to him in a club,
come to that.

980
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,310
You do know what you’re doing, old
chap? With Jenny?

981
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,490
- This is the one, Danny.
- Right.

982
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,470
You see, she’s different.

983
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,330
I just don’t want to see her hurt.

984
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,140
Have you bought any more paintings
recently?

985
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,590
Have I? Yes.

986
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,470
I picked up a little Piper.

987
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,500
A good one, I think.

988
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,800
I’m still trying to work out what
makes good things good.

989
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:35,910
It’s hard, isn’t it?

990
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,445
The thing is, Jenny, you know,

991
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:43,520
without necessarily being able to
explain why. See, You have taste.

992
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:48,090
That’s not half the battle. That’s
the whole war.

993
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,620
Jenny, we should go. It’s late.

994
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,090
- Really?
- Yeah.

995
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,840
Alas. One day, school will be over
forever,

996
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,760
we can talk about art all night.

997
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,930
You’re all right in a taxi, aren’t
you?

998
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,750
Yeah. I'm fine.

999
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,510
Let's go. Come on.

1000
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,410
Good night.

1001
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,240
Wait here.

1002
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,520
David, what are you looking for?

1003
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,370
It's just...

1004
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,760
What are you doing?

1005
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,220
Will you marry me?

1006
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,680
What were you looking for?

1007
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,830
I thought I had a ring.

1008
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,850
It wouldn’t have been the right one.
But it would have done for tonight.

1009
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,130
Oh, David.

1010
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,330
I’m serious.

1011
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,540
You’re very sweet.

1012
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,420
What do you think?

1013
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,520
Take me home.

1014
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,890
All right.

1015
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,390
<i>They do need some looking after,</i>

1016
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,610
<i>but nothing that will require too
much work.</i>

1017
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,170
<i>Just leave them in your potting shed
for a couple of weeks,</i>

1018
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,520
<i>and they’ll look after themselves.</i>

1019
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,970
Fine. The potting shed.

1020
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,020
Who does he think I am? Prince
Rainier of Monaco?

1021
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:11,560
What if I got married instead of
going to college?

1022
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,780
Married?

1023
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,910
Married.

1024
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,630
Well. It would depend who it was, of
course.

1025
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,070
Would it? That’s interesting.

1026
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,580
Of course it'd. I wouldn’t want you
married off just for the sake of it.

1027
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,280
Thanks.

1028
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:25,830
<i>Has somebody asked you?</i>

1029
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,680
Yes.

1030
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:28,030
Who?

1031
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,570
<i>David?</i>

1032
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,020
No. A man I just met walking his
dog.

1033
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:34,920
What did you tell him?

1034
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,170
Nothing yet.

1035
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,730
Do you have a choice? Or is it too
late.

1036
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:44,700
Of course she’s got a choice.
An interesting one, too, eh?

1037
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,970
This is where you’re supposed to
say, “But what about Oxford?”

1038
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,170
Well. Looked at it another way,

1039
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,160
you wouldn’t really need to go now,
would you?

1040
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:57,080
I wouldn’t need to go. Would you
like to expand on that?

1041
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:59,080
You'd been looking after.

1042
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:04,240
All that Latin! All those essays!
What was the point?

1043
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,010
Why didn’t you just send me prowling
round nightclubs?

1044
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,050
It would have been less trouble. And
I might have had more fun.

1045
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,290
I don’t know about nightclubs.
I know about education.

1046
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,980
Anyway, it looks like it might
have turned out for the best.

1047
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:15,860
How?

1048
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,210
He wouldn’t want you if you were
thick, would he?

1049
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,890
<i>May not an ass know when the cart
draws the horse?</i>

1050
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,040
Sings whoop jug I love thee.

1051
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:30,750
And when it says "Sings", it means
you sing a line.

1052
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,210
Never mind. Right. Lear...

1053
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,030
Does any here know me.
This is not Lear.

1054
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,740
<i>Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?
Where are his eyes?</i>

1055
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:48,580
Ha! Waking? Who is it that can tell
me who I am?

1056
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,750
Ooh. Miss. Me. I can.

1057
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,790
Oh, Jenny.

1058
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,810
What?

1059
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,990
Take it off.

1060
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:04,870
Oh my God. Is that what I think it
is?

1061
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,540
<i>I'm going to be a bridesmaid!</i>

1062
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,650
You know the school rule on jewelry.

1063
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,360
Half the girls in this room are
wearing jewelry.

1064
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,410
Yes. But none of it is going to ruin
their lives.

1065
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,860
We have a difference of opinion
about that.

1066
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,120
How far advanced are these
ridiculous plans?

1067
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:29,220
Have you set a date? Have you
decided on a church?

1068
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,630
We won’t be getting married in a
church. David’s Jewish.

1069
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:38,070
Jewish? He’s a Jew?

1070
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,290
You’re aware, I take it, that the
Jews killed our Lord?

1071
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,590
And you’re aware, I suppose, that
our Lord was Jewish?

1072
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,610
I suppose he told you that.

1073
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,160
We’re all very sorry about what
happened at during the War.

1074
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,360
But that’s absolutely no excuse for
that sort of malicious

1075
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,400
and untruthful propaganda.

1076
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,690
Anyway, I can see you are far more in
need of responsible advice

1077
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,140
than I realised.

1078
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:08,580
Nobody does anything worth doing
without a degree.

1079
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:13,410
Nobody does anything worth doing
with the degree. No woman, anyway.

1080
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,370
So what I do isn’t worth doing.

1081
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,370
Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs
Wilson, or any of us here.

1082
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,140
Because none of us would be here
without the degree,

1083
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,170
you do realise that, don’t you?

1084
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,250
And yes, of course studying is hard,
and boring...

1085
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,250
Boring!

1086
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,270
I’m sorry?

1087
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,900
Studying is hard and boring.
Teaching is hard and boring

1088
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,440
So what you’re telling me is to be
bored, and then bored,

1089
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:34,440
and finally bored again, but this
time for the rest of my life.

1090
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,980
This whole stupid country is bored.

1091
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,750
There’s no life in it, or colour,
or fun.

1092
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,010
It’s probably just as well that the
Russians are going to drop

1093
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,340
a nuclear bomb on us any day now.

1094
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:50,140
So my choice is to do something hard
and boring, or to marry my Jew,

1095
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,610
and go to Paris and Rome and listen
to jazz

1096
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,430
and read and eat good food in nice
restaurants and have fun.

1097
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,450
It’s not enough to educate us any
more, Mrs Walters.

1098
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,150
You’ve got to tell us why you’re
doing it.

1099
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,980
It doesn’t have to be teaching,
you know.

1100
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,930
There’s the Civil Service.

1101
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,590
I don’t wish to be impertinent,
Mrs Walters.

1102
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,450
But it is an argument worth
rehearsing.

1103
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:22,240
You never know. Someone else might
want to know the point of it all,

1104
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,290
one day.

1105
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,300
<i>Where did you find him?</i>

1106
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,420
<i>- I can't tell you that.
- Why?</i>

1107
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,120
<i>I think he likes you--- Do you like
her?</i>

1108
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,200
"I thought you would like her."

1109
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,940
You do... you don't...

1110
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:21,610
You don't remember? It's Jenny! You
remember her from the last time?

1111
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,510
"No. I don't"
Yes, you do.

1112
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,360
You're naughty! You're pardoned?
You're naughty.

1113
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,460
Go stick to your own species.

1114
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,030
He wants to kiss you, I think.

1115
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,470
Isn't that naughty?
- Yes.

1116
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We're engaged.

1117
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,200
<i>Seriously? No. Really?</i>

1118
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,150
- Yeah. - Engaged? - Show her.

1119
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,300
Yes. Look!

1120
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:44,300
Gosh. That’s fantastic news.

1121
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:45,880
Ooh, thank you.

1122
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,530
Congratulations.

1123
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,030
I knew you’d see sense about
university. You’ll stay pretty now.

1124
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,140
Thank you. Can I still read?

1125
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,630
Of course. But it doesn't have to be
books, does it?

1126
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,770
And magazines will do just as well.
And you learn more from them anyway.

1127
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,920
Oh, Helen.

1128
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:03,330
<i>You won’t be laughing, David, when
she gets all speccy and spotty.</i>

1129
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,670
Danny didn’t seem very pleased
about our engagement.

1130
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,170
I've noticed that, too. Thought he
might be a bit jealous.

1131
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,390
Jealous?

1132
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,550
We're going to keep him away from
you.

1133
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,910
I mean, what is supposed to order
for starter, anyway?

1134
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,080
And how will I know what is a
starter, or what is it not?

1135
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,590
We’ve been through this, Dad.

1136
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,290
It’ll be quite clearly marked on
the menu.

1137
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,930
Can’t the three of you just go on
your own. Leave me here.

1138
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,780
I’ll be perfectly happy with a tin
of seven.

1139
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

1140
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:54,010
Ready?
I think you’ll like this place, Jack.

1141
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,040
Their wine list is as good as
anything I’ve seen in London.

1142
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,980
Yes. Someone told me that.

1143
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,830
David, probably. Who else would it
have been?

1144
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:03,900
Madam.

1145
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,000
I was hoping you’d take us in this.

1146
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:08,330
Hey, you won’t want to drive in
anything else after tonight.

1147
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,630
Mind you, it drinks petrol.
- Yes.

1148
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:14,060
I’m afraid We’ll have to stop on the
way in to town.

1149
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,670
- I feel like Eamonn Andrews.
- Is that a good thing?

1150
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,520
Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person
that Jack can imagine being.

1151
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:37,300
How are you tonight, sir?
- Very well.

1152
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,020
You might as well fill her up.

1153
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,690
I'm going to make a quick call. I’ll
be two ticks.

1154
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,850
Do you think I should offer to help
pay for the petrol?

1155
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,630
Would he be insulted, what do you
think?

1156
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,600
I know, he said tonight was his
treat.

1157
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,050
But does that apply to the petrol,
what do you think?

1158
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,240
I'm quiet sure, it does, Jack.

1159
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,370
- Jack!
- Come on! It just came off.

1160
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,720
<i>- Filled my bill?
- Thank you, sir.</i>

1161
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:25,720
Cheers.

1162
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,760
Jenny. Jenny...

1163
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,320
Take us home.

1164
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,710
<i>What’s wrong?</i>

1165
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,490
I'm afraid there’s been--- Jenny's
had a bit of a shock.

1166
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,608
What’s happened? - It’s just another
one of David’s little muddles

1167
01:16:40,658 --> 01:16:42,358
<i>and misunderstandings.</i>

1168
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,110
I don’t want to hear another word
from anybody. Take us home. Now.

1169
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,260
Fine.

1170
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,760
<i>You can take care of this, can’t you,
David?</i>

1171
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,260
Go inside, Dad.

1172
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,860
Mr and Mrs David Goldman,

1173
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,740
Mr and Mrs David Goldman,

1174
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,140
Mr and Mrs David--- You’re married!

1175
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,310
Legally, yes, but...

1176
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,140
When were you going to tell me?

1177
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:20,800
Soon. It just never seemed the right
time.

1178
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,690
You seemed so happy, and I was
happy, and...

1179
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,590
You were living with your wife! All
this time!

1180
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:32,510
Round the corner. Byron Avenue.

1181
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,700
It’s no wonder we kept bumping into
each other, then, is it?

1182
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,250
What number?
- Thirty four.

1183
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:44,970
Don't be like this. Come on.

1184
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:55,720
I have nothing. I didn’t take my
exams. I do--- I left school.

1185
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,720
Where’s it all gone, now?

1186
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,730
I can get a divorce.

1187
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:08,420
Everything will turn out for the
best.

1188
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,710
Go and tell them.

1189
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,550
Go and tell them, then go and tell
your wife.

1190
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:28,110
They won't listen now. All right?

1191
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,350
I'll come round tomorrow. When
everyone’s a bit calmer.

1192
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,410
Please don’t make me tell them on my
own.

1193
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,680
You owe me that much. You owe them
that much.

1194
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,880
I owe them much more than that.

1195
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,100
Hey.

1196
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:08,420
Two minutes. And I’ll come out and
drag you in.

1197
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,100
What’s going on?

1198
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,320
He’s helping himself to some Dutch
courage before facing you.

1199
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,870
Stolen Dutch courage, from the look
of it.

1200
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,900
He has something he has to tell you.

1201
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,880
He just drove off.

1202
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:40,390
Can you tell us?

1203
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:44,190
Jenny? Please?

1204
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:52,400
<i>I wouldn't worry about it too much.</i>

1205
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:57,120
When I found out---
- Not now Helen!

1206
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,360
<i>I tried to tell him.</i>

1207
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,440
I’m not speaking to him now, if
that’s any consolation.

1208
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,020
It's a funny world you people live
in.

1209
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,680
You both watched me carrying on with
a married man,

1210
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,250
you don’t think it’s worth saying
anything about.

1211
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,850
Please, if you want that
conversation...

1212
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:29,050
You watched David and I help
ourselves to a map,

1213
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,300
and you didn’t say much, either.

1214
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,070
Come on you. Let's go. Good boy.

1215
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:09,210
Hello.

1216
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:14,360
Hello. Sorry, I think I have a wrong
number. I was looking for my...

1217
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:16,760
I wanted number of my cello lesson.

1218
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,660
Oh, no. Don’t tell me.

1219
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,160
Good God. You're a child.

1220
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,880
You didn’t know about any of this.
Presumably.

1221
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,470
No. They never do.

1222
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,360
You’re not in the family way, are
you?

1223
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:49,560
Because that’s happened before.

1224
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,520
Thank God for that.

1225
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,080
No, no, you stay here.

1226
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,390
- Did you see her?
- Yes. I saw her.

1227
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,530
I didn’t talk to her. There wasn’t
any need.

1228
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,430
We have to have this out.

1229
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,110
If you won’t do it, I will. I’m
still your father.

1230
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,260
Oh, you’re my father again, are you?

1231
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:29,810
What were you when you encouraged me
to throw my life away?

1232
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:32,910
Silly schoolgirls are always getting
seduced by glamorous older men.

1233
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,510
What about you two?

1234
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:04,210
Jenny?

1235
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:12,080
Jenny?

1236
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,530
Jenny, I'm sorry.

1237
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:29,200
I know I've made a mess of
everything.

1238
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,970
All my life I’ve been scared,
I didn’t want you to be scared.

1239
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:48,000
That’s why I wanted you to go to
Oxford.

1240
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:53,310
<i>And then along came David...
he knew famous writers,</i>

1241
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,360
<i>he knew how to get to classical
music concerts...</i>

1242
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,420
<i>But he wasn’t who he said he was.</i>

1243
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,630
<i>He wasn’t who you said he was,
either.</i>

1244
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,660
The other day, your mother and I
were listening to...

1245
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:22,960
a programme on the radio about
CS Lewis, and they said

1246
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:26,440
that he moved to Cambridge in 1954.

1247
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,520
<i>I said, Well, they’ve got that wrong,</i>

1248
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,300
<i>our Jenny wouldn't have his name
in her book,</i>

1249
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:41,800
<i>if he moved to Cambridge.</i>

1250
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,320
There’s a cup of tea, and some
biscuits out here.

1251
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,980
How do you think we can help?

1252
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:34,010
I want to repeat my last year at
school.  And take my exams.

1253
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,590
I got the impression the last time
we spoke

1254
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,740
that you didn’t see the point of
school.

1255
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:41,940
Or of me, or of any of us here.

1256
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,140
I know. I was stupid.

1257
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:47,750
The life I want, there's no
shortcut.

1258
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,530
I know now, that I need to go to the
university.

1259
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,360
It gives me absolutely no pleasure
whatsoever

1260
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:59,710
to see our young schoolgirls
throwing their lives away.

1261
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,030
Although, of course, you’re not one
of our schoolgirls any more.

1262
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,980
Through your own volition.

1263
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:08,080
I suppose you think I’m a ruined
woman.

1264
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,710
You’re not a woman.

1265
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,100
<i>No, I'm afraid, I think that the
offer of a place at this school</i>

1266
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:17,900
<i>would be wasted on you.</i>

1267
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:43,710
Come in.

1268
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,500
<i>I didn't expect to see you again.</i>

1269
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,550
This is lovely.

1270
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,740
All your books and pictures and...

1271
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,810
Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.

1272
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,100
It’s all you need, isn’t it?

1273
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,490
Just somewhere to...

1274
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,390
I’m sorry I said those silly things.
I didn’t understand.

1275
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:31,230
Let’s forget about it.

1276
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,020
A Burne-Jones.

1277
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:43,530
Do you like him?

1278
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,640
I do. Still.

1279
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:51,380
Still? You sound very old and wise.

1280
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,590
I feel old. But not very wise.

1281
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:05,510
Miss Stubbs, I need your help.

1282
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:14,000
I was so hoping that’s what you were
going to say.

1283
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,850
Thank you, Marjorie.

1284
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,020
It's from Oxford.

1285
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:58,430
<i>It is my pleasure to inform you that
your application to read English</i>

1286
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,660
<i>at Oxford has been accepted.</i>

1287
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,590
<i>On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,
staff of the university...</i>

1288
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,500
<i>So I went to read English books,</i>

1289
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:31,000
<i>and did my best to avoid the speccy,
spotty fate</i>

1290
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:33,050
<i>that Helen predicted for me.</i>

1291
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:36,750
<i>I probably looked as wide-eyed,
fresh, and artless</i>

1292
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,610
<i>as any other student.</i>

1293
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,400
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

1294
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,840
<i>One of the boys I went out with---</i>

1295
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:45,760
<i>and they really were boys,</i>

1296
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,260
<i>once asked me to go to Paris with
him.</i>

1297
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:52,570
<i>And I told him. And I'd love to,
I was dying to see Paris.</i>

1298
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,240
<i>As if I'd never been.</i>
