1
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,935
Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out.

2
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,857
Welcome, my friend.

3
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,109
Great to see you.

4
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,152
Yeah, glad you made it.

5
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,572
This can't be Ajit.
He's a little man already.

6
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,075
- Unbelievable.
- I hope you're hungry, Adrian.

7
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,536
I'm famished. How are you, Aparna?

8
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,205
- I made that fish curry you love.
- I can't wait.

9
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,875
She gets more beautiful
every time I see her. Why is that?

10
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,713
Strange, isn't it?
But her fish curry is still awful.

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,384
You were mysterious on the phone.
Why didn't you attend the conference?

12
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,388
- I will show you, Adrian, sir.
- Satnam, stop "siring" me.

13
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,105
How deep do we need to go?

14
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,648
Eleven thousand feet.

15
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,277
I searched all over India
for this thing.

16
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,238
Used to be the deepest copper mine
in the world.

17
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,203
Remember my brother, Gurdeep?
He's a student now.

18
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,289
Namaste, Dr. Helmsley, sir.

19
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,916
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

20
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,671
Just don't pour too much, huh?

21
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,925
How do you work in this heat?

22
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,802
You've come on a good day,
my friend.

23
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,930
Sometimes it can hit 120 degrees.

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,391
You have to come and meet
Dr. Lokesh...

25
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,353
...a Fellow of quantum physics
at the university in Chennai.

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,480
Dr. Helmsley.

27
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,901
So, what are we looking at?

28
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,778
These are neutrinos acting normally.

29
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,947
Minuscule mass,
no electrical charge.

30
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,617
They pass through ordinary matter
almost undisturbed.

31
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,870
Your message said the count doubled
after the last solar eruptions.

32
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,039
That was last week.

33
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,417
But this happened two days ago.

34
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,092
The biggest Sun eruptions
in human history...

35
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,303
...causing the highest neutrino count
we've ever recorded.

36
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,806
My God.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,686
That's not what worries me, Adrian.

38
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,147
For the first time ever...

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,859
...the neutrinos are causing
a physical reaction.

40
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,489
That's impossible.

41
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,495
That feels very good.

42
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,916
Please, follow me.

43
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,547
You won't believe this.

44
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,844
This water tank goes down
another 6000 feet.

45
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,305
It looks like the neutrinos
coming from the Sun...

46
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,018
...have mutated into a new kind
of nuclear particle.

47
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,527
They're heating up
the Earth's core...

48
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,530
...and suddenly act like microwaves.

49
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,671
Ladies and gentlemen,
as promised, no speech...

50
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,716
...just a thank-you...

51
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,635
...because tonight,
with your extraordinary generosity...

52
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,473
...we have raised $1.7 million.

53
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,893
Have a stiff drink,
because I'm locking the doors...

54
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,146
- ... and passing the hat around again.
- It's okay. It's okay.

55
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,315
- I work for the White House.
- I don't care.

56
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,442
This is a black-tie event.

57
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,361
Scotty.

58
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,239
Hey. Adrian, I thought you were
in India. What's going on?

59
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,075
- I need yourjacket.
- What?

60
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,119
I gotta speak to Anheuser.
Give me your damn jacket, please.

61
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,621
- All right.
- Okay?

62
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,457
- All right, here. Here.
- Hold that for a minute, will you?

63
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,837
Hey! Easy, that's a $600 jacket.

64
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,007
Mr. Anheuser?

65
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,425
Mr. Anheuser.

66
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,595
I need to talk to you.

67
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,849
- Do I know you?
- Sorry, sir.

68
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,434
My name's Dr. Adrian Helmsley.

69
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,563
I'm a deputy geologist at the Office
of Science and Technology Policy.

70
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,108
Excuse me, fellas.

71
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:03,195
You know that this is a fundraiser,
not a frat party, right?

72
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,781
- It's important, sir.
- You know what? It always is.

73
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,450
Make an appointment with my...
You know, even better:

74
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,161
Have your boss bring it up
at the quarterly briefing.

75
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,080
There's a good plan.

76
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,833
I just traveled 20 straight hours
to get here, sir.

77
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,751
I haven't slept in two days.

78
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,463
You need to read this, sir.
You need to read it now.

79
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,055
Let me guess,
national geology crisis?

80
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,224
Excuse me.

81
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,828
- Who do you report to?
- Lee Cavazos.

82
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,955
Not anymore.

83
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,127
Alan, bring the car around.

84
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,546
- You're gonna wish you took a shower.
- Sir?

85
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,423
You're about to meet the president.

86
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,841
What's going on?

87
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,926
Get that to the office.

88
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,935
No G8! No G8! No G8!

89
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,707
Good morning.

90
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,419
I would like to meet privately
with my fellow heads of state.

91
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,050
Mr. Makarenko wishes
to have his interpreters present.

92
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,220
Mr. President, I can assure you...

93
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,891
...your English is more than sufficient
for what I have to say.

94
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,871
Mr. Presidents.

95
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,168
Six months ago...

96
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,464
...I was made aware of a situation
so devastating...

97
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,260
...that, at first, I refused to believe it.

98
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,470
However...

99
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,515
...through the concerted efforts...

100
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,226
...of our brightest scientists...

101
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:43,272
...we have confirmed its validity.

102
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,069
The world as we know it...

103
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,948
...will soon come to an end.

104
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,461
This dam project
will create many newjobs.

105
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,966
The Party and country
will assist in your relocation.

106
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,178
Grandma, give me your hand.

107
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,056
- But where are they taking us?
- It'll be all right.

108
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,520
Brother!

109
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,357
Grandma, I will send you money.

110
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,655
Who can write?

111
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,824
Who can read?

112
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,410
Who can weld?

113
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:15,197
Has His Highness had an opportunity
to study the dossier?

114
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,288
You must understand,
I have a very big family, Mr...?

115
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,374
Isaacs.

116
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,043
One billion dollars is a lot of money.

117
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,049
I'm afraid the amount is in euros,
Your Highness.

118
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,819
I put a lot of faith
into your organization.

119
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,407
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

120
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,118
There are too many fanatics out there
that could damage her.

121
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,664
Just think about the beautiful Buddha
statues they blew up in Afghanistan.

122
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,794
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections...

123
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,797
...from the British Museum
and L'Hermitage.

124
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,141
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away...

125
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:29,521
...hidden in some bunker
in Switzerland.

126
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
Perfectly safe, Roland.

127
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,196
Only infrared analysis
would reveal the difference.

128
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,616
But it's still a fake.

129
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,883
This mass suicide was actually
discovered by a documentary crew...

130
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,344
...here in the ancient Mayan city
of Tikal.

131
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,513
Now, the victims,
and we've seen many...

132
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,391
...are said to have adhered
to the Mayan-Quiche calendar...

133
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,643
...which predicts
the end of time to occur...

134
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,020
...on the 21st of December
of this year...

135
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,231
...due to the Sun's
destructive forces.

136
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,482
Thank you, Mark.

137
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,360
Strangely enough,
scientific records do support the fact...

138
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,615
...that we are heading for the biggest
solar climax in recorded history.

139
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:26,995
Well, yes.

140
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,000
Apparently many people believe
that the Mayan calendar predicts...

141
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,711
...that there's supposed
to be a galactic alignment...

142
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm a dead man.

143
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,923
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

144
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,385
...it's the end of the world in 2012.

145
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,554
Goddamn it.

146
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,353
Hey, Kate. I'm practically
on the freeway right now.

147
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,940
Yes, I'm hurtling toward you
as we speak.

148
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,277
Will you relax?
Yeah, I'll be there any second.

149
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,531
You know it's a vacation
and not a doctor's appointment, right?

150
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,199
That it's supposed to be fun?

151
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,326
You remember fun, don't you, Kate?

152
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,080
Do you remember where you were
when it stopped being fun for you?

153
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,709
Yeah. I got it.

154
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,176
Bug spray? Oh, yeah, because
it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

155
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,930
I got a whole bunch. Okay, I gotta go,
because I'm in a bad-reception area.

156
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,730
Whoa, man.

157
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,690
Would you look at that?

158
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,275
Sick.

159
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,824
Merrill, I told you.

160
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,827
We have to move back
to Wisconsin.

161
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,331
Yeah, but these little mini-quakes
are really getting on my nerves.

162
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,584
A little surface crack? You're not
gonna be inconvenienced by that.

163
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,379
Right, surface cracks.
I got a plastic surgeon for that.

164
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,839
Thank God for those shake-proof
coffee mugs, Lisa.

165
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,092
They show the true nature
of us Californians.

166
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,178
We'll not bow to these inconvenient
things like surface cracks.

167
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,101
If you have a funny mini-quake story
and wanna share it, call 555-1070...

168
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,652
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

169
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,279
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.

170
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,948
Jackson, what is this?

171
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,367
Please don't call me that.
I'm your dad.

172
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,619
Come on.

173
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,247
You're taking them camping
in a limo?

174
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,957
Okay, great.

175
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,750
What happened to your temp job?

176
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,753
Oh, you know, better hours,
more time to write.

177
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,673
What about sleeping? Have you
been doing any of that lately?

178
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,970
I've said it a thousand times, no lipo
on Fridays. It's too messy. Hold on.

179
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,471
- Morning, Jackson.
- Hi.

180
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,806
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

181
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,307
Guys, have a nice trip.

182
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,144
Remember, watch out for the bears.
You know, they're:

183
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,520
Bye, Gordon.

184
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,647
- Love you, honey.
- Bye.

185
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,899
- Okay, so, Lil... Oh, yeah.
- You tell him.

186
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,735
Tell me what?

187
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,487
She needs to put these on
before she goes to sleep.

188
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,322
- Still?
- Yes.

189
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,035
Your 7-year-old still wets her bed.
That's something you should know.

190
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,495
- I love you.
- Love you, Mom.

191
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,998
- Hey.
- You okay?

192
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,586
They've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

193
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,837
I know.

194
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,882
- So don't be on your computer.
- Got it.

195
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,596
Love you.

196
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,686
- So this time, we hit Japan.
- So?

197
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,563
Well, you could visit your boy, Will.

198
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,065
Afternoon, ladies.

199
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,733
- Hello there.
- Hello, handsome.

200
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,276
Are you even listening to me?

201
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,028
Unfortunately, I am, Harry.

202
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,072
I heard from Audrey
you're a grandpa now.

203
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,699
Would you mind keeping your nose
out of my family?

204
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,786
You're cramping my style, baby.
There we are.

205
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,414
So he married a Japanese girl.
How is that the end of the world?

206
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,708
Come on, Tony.
You should at least go see him.

207
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,586
- You see your boy?
- Not as much as I'd like.

208
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,130
D.C. is a long way,
but at least we talk.

209
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,632
About what?

210
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,469
Life, and how short it is.

211
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,453
What the hell was that?

212
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,751
Hello?

213
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,586
Laura.

214
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,755
Laura, can you hear me?

215
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,632
Roland, is that you?

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,759
Laura, they lied to us.

217
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,178
I've arranged a press conference
for tomorrow.

218
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,764
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

219
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,433
What are you talking about?

220
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,143
The art you collected...

221
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,562
...it's not in the Alps.

222
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,105
Those tunnels are empty.

223
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,356
I have proof!

224
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,276
Laura.

225
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,610
Laura, can you hear me?

226
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,364
- I'm losing you. Roland?
- Laura, can you hear me?

227
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,615
Laura.

228
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,475
Break it down.

229
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,314
- I liked that song.
- We lost it.

230
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,276
...going on the West Coast
with all those surface cracks.

231
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,822
I told myself, "Charlie,
get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. "

232
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,659
I don't want to miss all the fun
when it finally blows.

233
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,120
Let me tell you,
there's been government people...

234
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:05,584
...flying in and out all morning,
and trust me, they did not look happy.

235
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,087
- Always remember folks:
- That's weird.

236
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,256
- You heard it first from Charlie.
- Yeah, just when he said that?

237
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,009
What are the odds?

238
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,428
We're not seeing soil liquefaction
we'd expect...

239
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,890
...or any evidence of fracture
propagation within the tectonic plates.

240
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,101
- In English.
- The activity on the coast...

241
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,728
...is not caused by tecto...
By regular earthquakes.

242
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,273
And these surface cracks have
nothing to do with shifting fault lines.

243
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,652
You suggesting this could be the
beginning of the Cho Ming operation?

244
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,155
Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone
this morning to collect more data.

245
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,368
We have been following the schedule
you established, Mr. Helmsley.

246
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,037
The most important schedule
in the history of mankind.

247
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,873
Now you're telling me
we have to throw it out?

248
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,667
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,545
I was wrong.

250
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,593
Do you know how many times
I've heard those words in this office?

251
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,429
Zero.

252
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,057
Did you see this?

253
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,393
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
She insisted.

254
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,894
It's all over the news.

255
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,900
We are learning more
about this deadly car explosion.

256
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,778
The director
of the French National Museums...

257
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,073
...was to hold a press conference
at the Louvre this morning.

258
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,202
Coincidentally, his death took place
in the same Paris tunnel...

259
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,581
...where Princess Diana died
in 1997.

260
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,292
We are continuing to follow this story.
We will...

261
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,588
Laura, I don't believe you've met
Dr. Helmsley.

262
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,008
I just talked to him, Dad,
and he told me...

263
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,594
...that the organization
that I work for is a sham.

264
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,387
I mean, why would he say that?

265
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,061
You look just like your mother
when you get upset.

266
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,520
Did I ever tell you that?

267
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,898
Every time I get upset.

268
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,691
Daddy, a man was killed.

269
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,946
Honey, please sit down.

270
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,626
Only a dozen people
in this administration...

271
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,753
...know what I'm about to tell you.

272
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,005
Dad, what's going on?

273
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:23,472
An unprecedented international
endeavor is underway.

274
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,185
At this point,
46 nations are invested in this thing.

275
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,479
Laura's a smart girl.
She'll understand.

276
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:34,274
That thing in Paris, we're not involved
in any of that, are we?

277
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,861
We? Who the hell is "we"?
What are you talking about?

278
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,823
We need to focus on this timeline.
That's what we need to do.

279
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,409
- When do we let the country know?
- What do you mean?

280
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,037
The people, sir. They need to know.

281
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,790
Well, of course they do.

282
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,378
Listen, yourjob is to figure out
when this is all gonna fall apart.

283
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,838
My job is to figure out...

284
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:59,341
...how to retain some semblance
of government after it falls apart.

285
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,593
Until then,
we don't have time for anything...

286
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,679
...except for doing those jobs. Okay?

287
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,348
Call me the moment you get any news
from Yellowstone.

288
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,516
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,768
Cute girl, huh?

290
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,021
- Sir?
- The First Daughter.

291
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,107
- I saw you looking at her.
- I wasn't looking at her.

292
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,610
Better move fast, kid.
The end is near.

293
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:23,323
Adrian, your chopper's ready.
They're waiting on the South Lawn.

294
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,036
Daddy, where are we going?

295
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,205
Going to this really special place
that I know.

296
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,208
It's a place where your mom and I
used to hang out a lot.

297
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,711
I don't wanna know
where you and Mom had sex.

298
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,422
- I'm not ready for that, Jackson.
- Stop calling me that.

299
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,759
It's creeping me out.
What's wrong with "Dad"?

300
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,886
- Grumpy Grumperson.
- Daddy, look at this.

301
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,056
That wasn't here before.

302
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,350
What do we do?

303
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,435
Go get your hat.

304
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,108
Don't you see the signs?

305
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,826
Used to be a lake here.

306
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,162
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

307
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,915
I know,
the whole damn thing's gone.

308
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,336
- Come on, let's check it out.
- Grwat.

309
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,944
Subjects have now entered
hot zone.

310
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,167
Who is that?

311
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,878
That's the U.S. Army.

312
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,101
All manner of government vehicle
are converging on subjects.

313
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,853
You're in a restricted area, sir.

314
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,689
- We need you to come with us.
- Right. Right.

315
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,983
Okay, we're gonna go
with these guys.

316
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,192
That'll be fun, huh?

317
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,281
This is wild.

318
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,533
This is really wild.

319
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,631
This is unbelievable.
2700 degrees Celsius at 40,000 feet?

320
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,967
I know,
it sounds completely implausible.

321
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,179
Nonetheless, we're ticking off
an increase of almost 0.5 percent.

322
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,431
- Per day?
- No.

323
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,640
Per hour.

324
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,852
Dr. Helmsley. We've arrested
a group of tourists in the hot zone.

325
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,354
Okay, I'll take care of it.

326
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,148
Look, let's get Satnam
on the communications link.

327
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,275
We'll try and cross-reference
the data.

328
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,528
It's a national park. There's not
supposed to be posted fences.

329
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,572
I mean, what's going on here?

330
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,491
We're geologists.

331
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,243
Do you usually go digging
with machine guns?

332
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,081
Major, I'll take care of this.
Thank you.

333
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:20,417
- What happened to the lake?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

334
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,711
We think the entire area
has become unstable.

335
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,923
I think you should take your kids
and leave, Mr. Curtis.

336
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,593
You're not by any chance
the Jackson Curtis...

337
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,137
...who wrote Farewell Atlantis,
are you?

338
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,141
The very same.

339
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,395
It's actually dedicated to my mom.

340
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,563
That's great.

341
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,651
I read a couple of your short stories
when I was in college. Yeah.

342
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,487
You know,
your father is a very talented man.

343
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,989
- Listen up.
- It's amazing. I'm reading your book.

344
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,493
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has
just lost communication with Earth.

345
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,578
You're one of the lucky few
who bought it.

346
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,414
- I didn't buy it.
- No?

347
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,249
My dad gave it to me.

348
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,127
Let me ask you something.

349
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,839
You believe those people
would behave so selflessly...

350
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,133
...knowing that their own lives
were at stake?

351
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,718
I hope so.

352
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:14,179
The critics said I was naive,
an unabashed optimist...

353
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,015
...but what do they know, right?

354
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,349
Well...

355
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,019
- Pleasure.
- It was a great pleasure meeting you.

356
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,439
Major, could you escort these
good people to the campgrounds?

357
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,773
This is yours.

358
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,275
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,443
- Take care.
- Okay.

360
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,819
He was very nice.

361
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,488
You're just saying that
because he liked my book.

362
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:40,456
Looks like that boy of yours
is gonna be smarter than any of us.

363
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,128
What's wrong?

364
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:49,006
I sent Satnam
the temperature reading.

365
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:53,052
My colleagues in Argentina and
Ontario have almost identical data.

366
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,637
It's so hot here,
we've had to seal off the mine.

367
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,474
- Double-checked the numbers?
- Triple-checked, my friend.

368
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,976
I wish we were wrong...

369
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,728
...but we're not.

370
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,814
The Earth's crust is destabilizing.

371
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,279
It's too early.

372
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,991
Adrian,
you have to begin the evacuation.

373
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,328
My God.

374
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,290
All our scientific advances,
our fancy machines...

375
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,335
The Mayans saw this coming
thousands of years ago.

376
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,721
I thought we'd have more time.

377
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,272
Okay.

378
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,358
I want you to pack up your family.

379
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,152
I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you
from Delhi.

380
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,987
Thank you, my friend.

381
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,781
And good luck.

382
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,208
Ajit.

383
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,378
We are going on a big ship.

384
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,217
- That was so cool.
- Yeah, that was intense.

385
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,553
- The helicopters.
- Craziest place I've seen.

386
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,390
- Those helicopters were so cool.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

387
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,559
Wait. Sorry. One question:

388
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:28,981
What did the government guys
say to you?

389
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,737
Well, they don't like us
going over their fences...

390
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,907
...and that the whole area
back there is unstable.

391
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,744
Unstable. They said "unstable"?

392
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:42,995
Yeah, unstable.

393
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,915
That's funny.

394
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,335
Let's go. Have a good one.

395
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,173
Unstable.

396
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,971
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

397
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,766
Temperatures are rising
with incredible velocity...

398
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,517
...in hot zones across the globe.

399
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,978
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Adrian?

400
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,813
Because once we give
these orders...

401
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,149
...there's no going back.
You understand that?

402
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:15,235
I'm afraid there's no longer
any doubt, sir.

403
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:19,782
We have to save what we can.
And we have to move now!

404
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:52,898
There's mosquitoes in here.
Did anybody spray the tent?

405
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,484
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

406
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,654
They just like you
because your blood's so sweet.

407
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,241
Dad, you said you wouldn't work
on your book.

408
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,869
What, Lil'bee? I'm not, I'm not.
I'm just... I'm doing something else.

409
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,331
Let me get you ready for...
Ready for bed.

410
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,166
Okay.

411
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,671
Did you really need all these hats?

412
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,590
- Where are your Pull-Ups, sweetie?
- I have them on.

413
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,516
Who gave you this, Mommy?

414
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,436
No, Gordon gave it to me
for my birthday.

415
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:34,356
A cell phone is something we gotta
talk about, you know, as a family.

416
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,692
What family?

417
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,949
That hurts my feelings
when you say stuff like that.

418
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,202
Just go away.

419
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,292
Adults get...

420
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,253
...hurt feelings too.

421
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,015
We have a listener calling in.

422
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,226
Bill from Cooke City,
you're on the Charlie Frost Show.

423
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,437
Charlie, just wanted to say
I love your show.

424
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,730
No way.

425
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,523
...not afraid to tell the truth.

426
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,525
Thank you, Bill.
What is your question?

427
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,903
I wanted to know,
where is all this gonna start?

428
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:24,406
Well, something like this could only
originate in Hollywood, Bill.

429
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:27,117
They got the Earth
cracking under their asses already.

430
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,204
Our family believes in the gospel
of the Lord Jesus.

431
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,957
- We have nothing to fear, Charlie.
- Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

432
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:38,921
This is Charlie Frost reporting live
from Yellowstone National Park...

433
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:44,176
...soon to become
the world's largest active volcano.

434
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,595
I'll be right back, folks.

435
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,643
Do you mind if I join you?
I wanted to ask you something.

436
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,353
I only got a minute.

437
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,355
Hey. Pickle?

438
00:30:56,731 --> 00:31:00,109
No. I was listening to the broadcast
and I was wondering...

439
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:04,071
...what exactly is it
that's gonna start in Hollywood?

440
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,115
It's the apocalypse.

441
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,033
End of days.

442
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,745
The Judgment Day,
the end of the world, my friend.

443
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:15,374
Christians called it the rapture,
but the Mayans knew about it...

444
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,794
...the Hopis, the I Ching...

445
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,629
...the Bible, kind of...

446
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:22,840
Beer?

447
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,010
- Yeah.
- So look, I gotta eat.

448
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:30,014
Why don't you download my blog.
It's free.

449
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:33,475
Of course,
we do appreciate donations.

450
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:37,813
In ancient times, the Mayan people
were the first civilization to discover...

451
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,482
...that this planet had
an expiration date.

452
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,151
According to their calendar...

453
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,821
...in the year 2012,
a cataclysmic event will unfold...

454
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,866
...caused by an alignment
of the planets in our solar system...

455
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:53,162
...that only happens
every 640,000 years.

456
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,997
Oh, not again.

457
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,917
Pretty neat, huh?
I did all the animation myself.

458
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,338
Just imagine the Earth
as an orange.

459
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:07,217
You lure them in with humor.
Then you make them think.

460
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:11,055
Our sun will begin to emit
such extreme amounts of radiation...

461
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,432
Those little bastards
are called neutrinos.

462
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,269
...that the core of the Earth will melt.
That's the inside part of the orange...

463
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,606
...leaving the crust of our planet
free to shift.

464
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:25,527
In 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood
named it Earth Crust Displacement.

465
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,697
Albert Einstein did support it.

466
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,032
People, we'll get it all.

467
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,077
The forces of Mother Nature
will be so devastating...

468
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:39,124
...it will bring an end to this world
on winter solstice, 12-21-12.

469
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:43,379
Always remember, folks,
you heard it first from Charlie Frost.

470
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,882
You'd have to keep a thing like this
under wraps.

471
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,134
I mean, just think about it, okay?

472
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,887
First, the stock market would go.

473
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:54,348
Then the economy, boom!

474
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,808
The dollar, boom!

475
00:32:55,975 --> 00:33:01,063
And then pandemonium in the streets.
War, genocide, boom, boom, boom!

476
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,817
Bullshit. Nobody could keep
that big a secret, Charlie.

477
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,736
- Somebody would blow the whistle.
- Every once in a while...

478
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,905
...some poor little sucker tries.

479
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,825
Well, like these guys, boom, boom!

480
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,662
Every one of these guys,
dead, dead, dead.

481
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,667
That's Professor Meyers.

482
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,670
He ran the Atlantis shuttle program.
Why, did you know him?

483
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,256
Yeah, he helped me
with research on my book.

484
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:30,009
Well, that must have been
before his "accident. "

485
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,301
Meyers is dead?

486
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,221
Oh, yeah, two months ago.

487
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:37,141
He was one
of my most avid listeners...

488
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,268
...and he had it all figured out.

489
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:42,771
Everything the government was doing,
where and why...

490
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,149
He even sent me a map.

491
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,236
A map for what, Charlie?
What's the map for?

492
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,955
They're building spaceships, man.

493
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,796
Shit, man, I have to go...

494
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:11,258
...because I gotta get back to Earth.

495
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:14,136
- But do you got a traveler for the road?
- This is my last...

496
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:17,473
Oh, that'll be all right. But, anyway,
I really enjoyed most of this.

497
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,807
Thank you so much.

498
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,809
Hey. Hey, guess what.

499
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,687
- They're selling seats.
- Put me down for three.

500
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,981
No, guys like you and me
don't have a chance.

501
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,609
You'd have to be Bill Gates
or Rupert Murdoch...

502
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,778
...or some Russian billionaire
or something.

503
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,654
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

504
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,574
Get them out of Yellowstone.

505
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,993
It's gonna get ugly here.

506
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,166
Why don't we make a baby?

507
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:48,712
We're not making a baby
in the supermarket.

508
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:52,800
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

509
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,471
Honey, women pay me thousands
of dollars to handle their boobs.

510
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,847
You get it for free.

511
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,993
You always act strange
after he shows up.

512
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,372
I'm not acting strange.
I'm looking for the macaroni.

513
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,669
So why did you
stick with him so long?

514
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,964
Can we just give it a rest, please?
He's the father of my children.

515
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,632
Oh, come on, Kate.

516
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,968
You gave up med school
so you could have Noah.

517
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:38,637
You practically raised
him and Lilly by yourself...

518
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,514
...while he sat writing that junk.

519
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,975
It's not junk. He's published.

520
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,768
Oh, published, right, I forgot.

521
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:47,396
Four hundred
and twenty-two copies.

522
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,078
Did you see that?

523
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:05,581
See what? Hey, Kate.

524
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:09,668
Listen, we have to keep
working at this, our relationship.

525
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:14,089
I mean, I don't know, honey. I just feel
like there's something pulling us apart.

526
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,802
Gordon!

527
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,596
Hang on! Hang onto the pole!

528
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:22,681
Kate. Don't let go.

529
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,099
- Oh, my God.
- Hang on!

530
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,267
Gordon!

531
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,104
Do you have anything
for mosquito bites?

532
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,106
Before or after?

533
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,026
I'd get before and after.

534
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,945
Stop scratching.
You're gonna get it all infected.

535
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,281
I had to make a stop
at the grocery store.

536
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,326
It's Mrs. Birnbaum.
She's my teacher, she's on TV.

537
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,538
Here is Grayson's Market, which
was open for business at the time...

538
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:50,125
...but fortunately, there were
no fatalities or injuries reported.

539
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,461
It really is a miracle
that no one got hurt.

540
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:55,005
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

541
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,051
Did you see what happened
to our supermarket?

542
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,472
She wants us to come home.

543
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,807
is this even possible?

544
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,142
We worked every option
through the night.

545
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,480
The good news, consensus is that four
of the arks will be operational in time.

546
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,315
Only four? You call that good news?

547
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,984
We can save over 400,000 people.

548
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:18,237
To me, sir,
that's nothing short of a miracle.

549
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:22,157
But we have to initiate
the boarding process now. Thomas.

550
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,326
We don't have a choice.

551
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,370
You have got to convince them.

552
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,791
Listen, I'll try to keep this brief.

553
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,003
According to the latest information
from Yellowsto...

554
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,172
- Please continue, Adrian.
- Thank you, sir.

555
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,717
The temperature
of the subterranean crust...

556
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:43,637
...that is, the cement that holds
our land mass in place...

557
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:47,099
...is increasing at a rapid rate,
much faster than anticipated.

558
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,352
As a result, we've observed
extreme polar instability.

559
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,313
The magnetic fields have decreased
by more than 80 percent...

560
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,024
...in the last 48 hours.

561
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:58,360
How much time do we have,
Dr. Helmsley?

562
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,364
Two, maybe three days,
if we're lucky.

563
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,869
How can you speak about luck
in such a situation?

564
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,788
Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister. I...

565
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,916
I meant no disrespect.

566
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:18,088
I'm afraid the longer we wait,
the more luck plays its part.

567
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,220
My friends...

568
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,974
...I recommend
we evacuate immediately.

569
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,271
If any of you have objections...

570
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,982
...please speak now.

571
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,568
In the blue corner...

572
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,197
...38 victories, 34 knockouts...

573
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:46,241
...the fighting machine
from the Ukraine...

574
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:50,788
...the undefeated number-one ranked
heavyweight challenger:

575
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:57,628
Mr. Zultan Balashin!

576
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,010
- Yuri!
- Zultan!

577
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,262
I feared you would not come.

578
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,431
He needs to concentrate now,
Mr. Karpov.

579
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,185
You shut up when I talk to my boy,
understand?

580
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,270
Yes, Mr. Karpov.

581
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:18,023
Good. That is good.

582
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,442
Zultan, listen to me...

583
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,612
...we are fighters,
we never go down...

584
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,533
...no matter how hard they hit us.

585
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,286
Kill the bastard.

586
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,623
Kill the bastard, Zultan.

587
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,167
Ladies and gentlemen...

588
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:41,296
...let's get ready to rumble!

589
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,468
Zultan!

590
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,664
Yuri, where are you going?

591
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,294
Yuri?

592
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,343
One, two, three...

593
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,722
Caltech believes that the half-mile
fissure running through Westwood...

594
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,974
...has released
most of the surface tension.

595
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:37,019
"Life will soon return to normal,"
Mayor Gonzales said...

596
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:40,522
- ... at an early news conference.
- Okay, guys. Almost home.

597
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:43,692
Rise and shine.

598
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,330
All right, you're free.

599
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,542
- Thank God.
- Mommy.

600
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,712
Hi, sweetheart.

601
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,093
Gordon!

602
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:12,346
Hey, buddy boy.

603
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,557
Good time? Yeah?

604
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,393
God, I missed you.

605
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Yeah.

606
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,105
- Who wants pancakes? Come on.
- Me.

607
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:28,779
- Thanks for bringing them home early.
- Yeah.

608
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,240
Pancakes?

609
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,410
Late for work.

610
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:48,007
- Yes, hello?
- Curtis, where are you?

611
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:51,760
- Just getting back from vacation, sir.
- Good. That is good.

612
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:54,304
I will send the jet
to pick up Alec and Oleg.

613
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:57,433
Yuri bear, tell him to bring
the raincoat for Caesar.

614
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,935
- It's in the Range Rover.
- Curtis.

615
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,271
- Yeah?
- Get my boys as fast as you can.

616
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,440
I'm hurtling towards you
as we speak, sir.

617
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:05,816
Good. That is good.

618
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,624
Curtis, you're late.

619
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,668
Good morning to you too.

620
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,967
Oh, be careful with our stuff.
Don't get your dirt on it.

621
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,886
Idiot.

622
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,394
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis.

623
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:47,983
What's your problem?

624
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:49,485
Be more careful.

625
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:51,195
He did that on purpose.

626
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,655
Hey, have a safe trip,
you little bastards.

627
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,991
Now you're laughing, Curtis...

628
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,160
...but we have tickets
to go on a big ship.

629
00:42:58,328 --> 00:42:59,912
We will live...

630
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,206
...and you will die.

631
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,678
Folks, did you hear that?

632
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:20,265
The authorities in L.A.
say there's nothing to worry about.

633
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:22,893
I'd love to see their dumb faces...

634
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,521
...when Malibu and Beverly Hills...

635
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:29,316
...get sucked into the gurgling maw
of the Pacific.

636
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,528
Where they gonna plug in
their electric cars then?

637
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,409
- Hey. is this your plane?
- Yes.

638
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:40,035
- Are you a pilot?
- Yeah.

639
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:42,079
I wanna rent it.
I'll give you anything.

640
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:43,997
Here.
This is a very expensive watch.

641
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:47,376
My editor gave it to me when
he thought I was gonna be somebody.

642
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:53,424
I confirmed with my people at Caltech
that in the last 36 hours...

643
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:58,137
...we had basically zero earthquake
activity in Southern California...

644
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:01,098
...which is very rare.
Unlike many of the tough characters...

645
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,600
- ... I've portrayed in my film career...
- Hello?

646
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,936
- Stop what you're doing.
- Jackson?

647
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,731
Listen to me. I've rented a plane.
Pack up the kids.

648
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,567
- I'm gonna be there in five minutes.
- Plane? What?

649
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:15,237
We're gonna do our regular Saturday.
Noah has music and Lil has karate.

650
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,072
Not that we'd expect him
to remember.

651
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,409
Kate, California is going down.
Pack up the kids now!

652
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,244
They just got back.

653
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:26,081
God, you sound like a crazy person.
The governorjust said we're fine now.

654
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:29,084
The guy's an actor.
He's reading a script.

655
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,003
When they tell you not to panic...

656
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,838
...that's when you run!

657
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:35,883
Okay, could you call me back
when you calm down?

658
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,761
Mommy, why is Daddy so crazy?

659
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:41,430
...taking the most severe hit
in Los Angeles.

660
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,974
Finish your pancakes, Al Capone.

661
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:48,020
It seems to me
that the worst is over.

662
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,398
Mommy!

663
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,494
Everyone hold on to each other.

664
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:06,622
- No, Lilly!
- Hold Mommy's hand and stay close.

665
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,042
Daddy!

666
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,502
Let's go! Let's go!

667
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,504
I think it's safer under here!

668
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:17,633
Get in the fucking car right now!

669
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,301
Move your ass! Move!

670
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:20,761
- Come on, kids.
- Get up!

671
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,638
- Move. Quick, quick!
- Move!

672
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:25,474
Go! Now!

673
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:28,811
- Come on, let's go.
- Run! Don't look back!

674
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:31,146
- Come on!
- Take her! Get in, honey, get in.

675
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:34,108
My hats.

676
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,361
Lilly, get in!

677
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:39,488
Get in!

678
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:41,907
- Buckle up!
- Lilly.

679
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,333
Sorry.

680
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,724
Jackson, hurry up. Look behind you.

681
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:10,102
- Holy...!
- Oh, God.

682
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,608
Get out of herw!
Get out of the way!

683
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:19,361
- Move it!
- Hold on to those eggs, dear.

684
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,530
- Come on!
- Come on, you old bags!

685
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:25,367
Sidewalk, sidewalk! Tree! Tree!

686
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:29,538
God. Carwful.

687
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,418
Everybody, hang on.

688
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:39,131
Oh, my God.

689
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:40,758
Careful, careful.

690
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:46,555
Yikes. That stinks.

691
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:54,480
We gotta get to the airport.

692
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:56,940
Well, take the freeway,
it'll be half the time.

693
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,653
Yeah, right.

694
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,411
Jesus.

695
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,415
We gotta get to the other side
of the freeway.

696
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:16,043
Daddy!

697
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:30,849
- Dad, look!
- No. We're not gonna make it! Careful!

698
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,110
- No, Daddy!
- Dad, look. Dad, look.

699
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,029
No, no, no!

700
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,461
It's been upgraded to a 10.9
by the guys at Harvard.

701
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,130
What does Caltech have to say?

702
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:05,467
The whole city of Pasadena
was wiped out just a few minutes ago.

703
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:08,595
This is coming in from Coachella
Valley out near Joshua Tree.

704
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:10,889
That canyon?
That wasn't there this morning.

705
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:15,060
And 400 miles further north,
Point Reyes, same thing.

706
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,605
The San Andreas Fault is shifting.

707
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:21,483
Yes. And all major sister faults
in the Bay Area.

708
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:25,487
The whole Pacific plate
is destabilizing.

709
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,537
Hold my hand. Stay close to me.

710
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,165
Come on!

711
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:38,208
- Who's that?
- Our pilot!

712
00:48:38,376 --> 00:48:41,003
Oh, jeez. It's our pilot.

713
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,088
Gordon. Gordon, you can fly.

714
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:46,717
No, no, I've only had a couple of
lessons in a single-engine plane only.

715
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,510
- You're the guy.
- I am not the guy.

716
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:52,556
- Trust me, you're the guy.
- I'm not being modest about this.

717
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,017
Come on, kids.
Gordon's gonna get us out of here.

718
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,353
That plane has multiple engines.

719
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:00,356
Jackson!

720
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,206
- T's and P's, T's and P's.
- T and P?

721
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,041
- Temperatures and pressures.
- Go!

722
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,794
- I've gotta do my preflight check.
- Let him concentrate.

723
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,295
He has no experience.

724
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,880
Thank you.

725
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:27,883
- Gordon, go.
- Come on.

726
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,094
- Gordon!
- Go, go, go!

727
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:34,973
- We're not there yet.
- Gordon, take off.

728
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,268
- Punch it, punch it!
- I have to get to 85 knots.

729
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:41,063
- Eighty's good.
- Oh, screw it. Here we go.

730
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:47,945
Okay. Okay, we're up.

731
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,831
Higher, higher!

732
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,453
Oh, my God.

733
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,648
Lilly, go sit with your brother.

734
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:14,323
I don't understand. How did you know
this was gonna happen?

735
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:17,034
It is not just California.

736
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,912
It's the whole goddamn world
that's going to shit.

737
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,206
I met this guy in Yellowstone,
this crazy guy.

738
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,042
He's been right about everything
that's happened so far.

739
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,503
And he said the government
is building spaceships.

740
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,838
- I don't know what, but something.
- Ships?

741
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:31,840
Yeah, places where we can be safe.

742
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,843
He knows where they are.
He's got a map.

743
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:36,345
Jackson.

744
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,639
Kate, you gotta just trust me on this,
okay?

745
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,350
Guys, look.

746
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:07,209
There's a twist and a turn
To each lesson you learn

747
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:10,713
First you're up, then you're bust
Livin' life on a crust

748
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,049
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy

749
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:17,052
It's only the end of this song

750
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,639
It's been a gas, been a flip
Been a hell of a trip

751
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:25,728
But it ain't the end of the world

752
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:28,397
Oh, yeah.

753
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:29,648
Thank you.

754
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:31,066
You got fans, Tony.

755
00:52:33,236 --> 00:52:35,821
There's a call for you.
You want me to take a message?

756
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,032
No, that's all right, Kevin. I got it.

757
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:45,414
- Hello.
- Dad?

758
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:46,915
Adrian.

759
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:50,669
Remember when I told you
about that dam in China?

760
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:52,129
Yeah.

761
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,089
It's happening, Dad.

762
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:07,144
They'd probably shoot me
if they knew that I told you.

763
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:11,440
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son.
They need you.

764
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:15,235
The president has ordered us
to clear out the White House.

765
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:17,946
About time somebody cleaned up
that mess.

766
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:22,534
Where are you, Dad?

767
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:26,246
What exactly is the course
of the Genesis right now?

768
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:28,791
It's all good, Adrian.

769
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:31,960
Don't you be worrying
about your old man now.

770
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:35,130
You got more important things
to do now.

771
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,134
You know...

772
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:41,970
...your mom and I, we...

773
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:45,349
We had one hell of a great life, son.

774
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:50,604
And the best part about that...

775
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:54,483
...is we had
one hell of a great kid too.

776
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:59,154
Now, you lookie here.

777
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:01,198
The Genesis...

778
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:03,826
...it's a pretty big ship, son.

779
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:08,497
So don't you write your old man off
just yet.

780
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:09,665
Besides...

781
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:14,420
...you know I couldn't leave
Tony alone.

782
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:19,091
You know that old fool
can't keep decent time by himself.

783
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:23,178
I love you, Dad.

784
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,644
I love you too, son.

785
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,938
God knows I do.

786
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:48,287
Kevin, I want a double.

787
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:52,666
- Harry.
- I need a double right now.

788
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,380
Thank you, son.

789
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:05,929
After 25 years on the wagon,
are you out of your mind?

790
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:23,405
- What are you doing?
- Gotta go.

791
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:26,575
- That's against regulation.
- Careful, careful.

792
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,414
- Anything?
- Yeah, there's fuel.

793
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:34,333
Fill it up. I'm gonna find Charlie.

794
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,168
Daddy, wait. I wanna come with you.

795
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:39,254
- No, no. Lil. Lil, no!
- It's all right. Just fill it up.

796
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,423
- We'll be back.
- Jackson, hurry, please.

797
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,927
I'm standing here
at the highest point...

798
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:50,057
...of what is the rim of the world's
largest super-volcano...

799
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:56,146
- ... Mount Bighorn, elevation 2779 feet.
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

800
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:01,527
I can only hope that all of you
have made your peace with God...

801
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,029
- He's gotta be around somewhere.
- Let's go back.

802
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:06,865
No, no, no. We gotta find Charlie
because he's got a map.

803
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:09,326
It's like a secret map,
like in the Pirate movies.

804
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,286
- We gotta work as a team, okay?
- Okay.

805
00:56:11,454 --> 00:56:13,122
Okay, come on.

806
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:16,125
Call Mommy and tell her
we're gonna be 5 minutes late.

807
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,965
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Mommy.

808
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,300
- It's Lilly.
- Sweetheart, where are you?

809
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:28,012
- Hi, Mommy.
- Let me speak to Daddy, sweetie.

810
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:31,223
He can't talk right now.
He's driving really, really bad.

811
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,853
Any minute now,
the fireworks are gonna start.

812
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,813
Who is that?
Who's speaking in the car?

813
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:41,025
He's not in the car. He's on
a mountain waiting for fireworks.

814
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:44,319
- Fireworks? What fireworks?
- Daddy. Daddy, over there.

815
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:47,031
...to send all of Yellowstone
into outer space?

816
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:48,490
Good job, Lilly. Good job.

817
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,161
Let me talk to Mom.

818
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:55,581
- Kate, we got him.
- Jackson, bring back my child now.

819
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:02,004
Okay. You stay here
and guard the ship...

820
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:04,882
- ... and I'm gonna go talk to the pirate.
- Okay.

821
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,718
...your race, your country, your god.

822
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:12,598
Whether you're a Christian or
a Buddhist or Muslim or Rastafarian...

823
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:16,018
- ... by tomorrow we will all be one!
- Charlie.

824
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,062
- Jackson. What are you doing here?
- Yeah.

825
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:21,065
- I thought you were toast.
- No. Where are the spaceships?

826
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:23,359
There's no way
you can make it there.

827
00:57:23,526 --> 00:57:27,571
We have a plane. You could come
with us, but we gotta leave right now.

828
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:38,040
Fly, birdies.

829
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,042
Fly!

830
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,794
is this your kid?

831
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:43,962
Where's the goddamn map?

832
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,048
- We're going live.
- Where is it?

833
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,967
Charlie. Focus. Where's the map?
Where?

834
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:50,219
It's in the camper.

835
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:51,428
Where in the camper?

836
00:57:51,596 --> 00:57:54,932
In the map section
on the conspiracy shelf.

837
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,017
Dewey decimal system.

838
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:59,603
Between Roswell...

839
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:02,898
...and Marilyn Monroe.

840
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:13,283
It's starting.

841
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,752
You sure you don't wanna come with,
man?

842
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,381
It's so beautiful. I'm gonna stay.

843
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:29,883
Good luck.

844
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:38,600
This marks the last day
of the United States of America.

845
00:58:39,936 --> 00:58:43,272
And, by tomorrow, all of mankind.

846
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,941
And we will be visible
from the Milky Way...

847
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,819
...as a tiny little puff of smoke.

848
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:53,991
I'm watching the earth crumble
before my eyes.

849
00:58:54,951 --> 00:59:00,539
The giant ash cloud
created by this super-volcano...

850
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:02,791
...will first envelop Vegas...

851
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,793
...and then St. Louis...

852
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:07,463
...and then Chicago...

853
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,673
...and then, at long last...

854
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:14,303
...Washington, D.C.
will have its lights go out!

855
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:17,473
- That guy's crazy, right, Daddy?
- I don't think so.

856
00:59:20,352 --> 00:59:21,810
This is ridiculous.

857
00:59:21,978 --> 00:59:24,563
Been over half an hour.
I tell you, the guy's a nut job.

858
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:26,315
Stop it, Gordon.

859
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:28,400
Noah, hand me the phone again.

860
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,549
Daddy, what was that?

861
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:56,011
Nothing. Nothing.

862
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:59,348
I have goose bumps, people.

863
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,415
I wish you could see
what I'm seeing, people.

864
01:00:24,582 --> 01:00:27,126
I wish you could be here with me!

865
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,212
Oh, baby.

866
01:00:31,214 --> 01:00:33,215
Bring it on!

867
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:35,050
Always remember, folks...

868
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:39,096
...you heard it first from Charlie!

869
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,405
Daddy, it's following us.

870
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,073
Don't look! Get on the ground.

871
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,409
Get on the ground and hold on.
Don't look back.

872
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:03,620
Don't look back. Just look at me.
Look at me. Do I look scared?

873
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,961
Now, hold on, baby. Hold on tight.

874
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:19,762
Daddy, we're on fire.

875
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:30,272
There it is! There they are.

876
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:36,987
It's them.

877
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:39,198
It's them. It's them.

878
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:41,700
Mommy!

879
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:46,789
Jeez.

880
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,798
- No, Daddy.
- Hang on, baby. Hang on!

881
01:01:58,843 --> 01:02:00,010
No, Daddy!

882
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:10,479
Oh, my Go...

883
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:13,357
- Mommy.
- Take her, take her. I'll be right back.

884
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:23,033
- Come here, Lil. Grab my hand.
- Come on, Lil. Lilly, you okay?

885
01:02:23,201 --> 01:02:25,536
Aliens, Roswell
and Marilyn Monroe...

886
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:27,246
Maps! Maps!

887
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:30,582
- Everybody on? Are we ready?
- Jackson!

888
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,672
- Kate, where is he? What's he doing?
- I don't know.

889
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,427
No!

890
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:51,603
- Daddy!
- No!

891
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:58,027
- Oh, my God.
- Kate, we have to go.

892
01:02:58,194 --> 01:02:59,778
No. We're not going anywhere.

893
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:03,824
- Kids, buckle up, we're leaving.
- This is my dad. We're gonna wait.

894
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,456
No!

895
01:03:10,623 --> 01:03:12,207
Daddy!

896
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:18,630
Wait!
Wait, Gordon, I see something.

897
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:20,382
Dad!

898
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:26,138
It's Daddy!

899
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,894
Slow down!

900
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,062
Jackson, run!

901
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:36,565
Jackson, take my hand. Jackson.

902
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,942
- Dad, hurry!
- Run!

903
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:42,905
We're running out of runway.
For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up.

904
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:46,617
- Jackson, reach for my hand.
- Dad, you can make it, come on.

905
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,452
Daddy!

906
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:54,583
All right, buckle in. Here we go!

907
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:57,336
Come on, faster. Faster.

908
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:18,816
Hang on.

909
01:04:21,152 --> 01:04:22,986
- Go faster.
- I'm trying.

910
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:41,797
Okay. We're good!

911
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:44,800
- We're good.
- We're okay.

912
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:51,306
So now that you got your map,
where are we going?

913
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:04,737
We're gonna need a bigger plane.

914
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,663
No, you just said that, Mom.
Yeah, you just said that.

915
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:16,832
You don't remember
that you just said that?

916
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,210
That's okay. That's okay.

917
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:24,506
Listen, Ma, I am going to call you
next week, same time.

918
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:26,258
Okay?

919
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:28,677
You take care now.
Take care of yourself.

920
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:33,766
Sir?

921
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,685
I think you need to see this.

922
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,401
I thought for sure
they'd give you an extra ticket, sir.

923
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:45,903
They did.

924
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:48,739
But my mother is almost 89...

925
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:51,867
...she's in a wheelchair,
and she's easily confused.

926
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,828
And I am confident that she
would want to meet her maker...

927
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:56,747
...on her own terms, okay?

928
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:58,707
Yes, sir. Who are you bringing?

929
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:02,419
Nobody. Who, my ex-wife?
Last thing she said to me...

930
01:06:02,587 --> 01:06:04,880
...she never wanted to see me again.
So be it.

931
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,049
We need to bring people
who can contribute.

932
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:09,385
The South American continent
has been ravaged...

933
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:11,261
...by a series of major earthquakes.

934
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:14,515
The death toll is expected
to be well over 2 million people.

935
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:17,935
The devastation in Rio de Janeiro
is beyond imagination.

936
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:21,105
Two 8.5 tremors have left
the people in the streets...

937
01:06:21,272 --> 01:06:23,899
...desperately fighting
for the last remaining resources.

938
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:28,362
In the last hour, we received this video from Globo News, Brazil.

939
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:37,955
Fear and chaos have spread
throughout the globe, as in London...

940
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:40,958
...where the 30th Olympic Games
have just been suspended.

941
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:44,044
Hundreds of thousands are marching
towards 10 Downing Street...

942
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:47,006
...demanding a lift
of the information blackout.

943
01:06:47,173 --> 01:06:49,758
We've had thousands of calls.
We had to shut it down.

944
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:52,511
We're receiving reports
from all across the globe.

945
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,930
Millions upon millions
of distraught masses...

946
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:58,308
...are gathering in public places,
converging in desperate prayer.

947
01:06:58,476 --> 01:07:00,561
Preachers of many
religious denominations...

948
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:02,646
...have taken their message
of the end...

949
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,440
...to the strwets all over the U.S.

950
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:06,942
Repent. There is still time.

951
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,988
Kind of galling when you realize that
nutbags with their signs had it right.

952
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:13,282
All these people out there, sir...

953
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,284
...shouldn't we be
issuing warnings now?

954
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:18,287
Only when the boarding process
is complete. That's the plan.

955
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:21,457
- British Columbia, 2010, remember?
- Sir.

956
01:07:21,624 --> 01:07:23,834
Sir, those plans were drawn up
two years ago.

957
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:27,463
Okay. Everybody out.
Go on, get out.

958
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:28,672
Mary, get the door.

959
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:31,675
Wasn't it decided
that people have the right...

960
01:07:31,843 --> 01:07:33,969
...to fight for their lives
best way they can?

961
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,472
After we get everyone on board,
Adrian.

962
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:37,681
I think that's wrong.

963
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:41,602
Wha...? Just wanna tell everyone
they're doomed?

964
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,895
There'd be anarchy.

965
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:46,315
- You wanna jeopardize the president?
- Come on.

966
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:51,236
Our mission is to assurw
the continuity of our species.

967
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:55,366
My question: Can I count on you?

968
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:56,909
Can I?

969
01:07:57,577 --> 01:07:58,786
What?

970
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:00,579
The Yellowstone caldera
has erupted.

971
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:04,375
The ash cloud will reach Washington
in roughly seven hours.

972
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:07,670
We've got to get
the government airborne.

973
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,713
Where's the president, Sally?

974
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:12,841
Said he wanted some time alone.
I think he's over at the chapel.

975
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:15,386
- He's gotta go to church now?
- He's praying, sir.

976
01:08:15,553 --> 01:08:18,263
Which, under the circumstances,
is not such a bad idea.

977
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:23,519
Mr. President.

978
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:26,605
I need to get you on Air Force One
immediately.

979
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,733
Give me a moment with Adrian.

980
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,027
No disrespect,
but we simply do not have time.

981
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:33,612
Make time.

982
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:49,169
Did you ever meet my wife,
Dorothy?

983
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:52,548
No, sir. I didn't have that honor.

984
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:56,427
She was in and out of it
towards the end.

985
01:08:57,262 --> 01:09:01,265
The night before she passed on,
she took my hand and she told me:

986
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:05,102
"I think you should have a lottery.

987
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:09,732
Everyone should
have a chance to go. "

988
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,236
Maybe that's what
we should have done.

989
01:09:17,907 --> 01:09:22,369
I'll be the last president
of the United States of America.

990
01:09:22,537 --> 01:09:24,580
Do you know how that feels, son?

991
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:28,625
No one could have
saved the country, sir.

992
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:31,420
And I think...

993
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:34,590
I think people have a right to know.

994
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:38,093
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

995
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:41,305
Go on now.

996
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:44,933
Not without you, sir.

997
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:48,103
You get on that plane, son.

998
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,649
It's a brave new world
you're heading to.

999
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:58,030
And a young scientist
is gonna be worth 20 old politicians.

1000
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:18,801
We should go to my parents' house
in the Rockies.

1001
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:23,138
This isn't one of your crazy stories.
How are we gonna make it to China?

1002
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:26,642
Gordon, without Jackson, we wouldn't
have made it out of California.

1003
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,310
Noah, please.

1004
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:38,320
You, be careful
with the landing gear.

1005
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,823
Easy, gringo. I know what I doing.

1006
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:43,492
Attention. The National Guard
has informed us...

1007
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,619
...that an extremely hazardous
ash cloud...

1008
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,204
...is headed for Las Vegas.

1009
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,664
Hey, where are you going?

1010
01:10:48,832 --> 01:10:51,333
Everyone move indoors
immediately.

1011
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:53,711
- Sir, you can't stay here.
- I have plane here.

1012
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:55,087
It's not safe. Move it!

1013
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:57,089
Move it!

1014
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:08,767
So you have
positive confirmation on this?

1015
01:11:10,228 --> 01:11:12,021
Thank you, I understand.

1016
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:24,533
President's not coming.

1017
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:31,040
So...

1018
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:35,711
...the captain doesn't want to abandon
his sinking ship.

1019
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,296
That's his choice.

1020
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:39,548
And a noble one.

1021
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,093
I have also just learned
that the vice-president's chopper...

1022
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,804
...went down in the ash cloud
outside of Pittsburgh.

1023
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:50,642
Fortunately,
we have protocols to follow.

1024
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,728
What about
the Speaker of the House?

1025
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:56,231
- I have no idea. Where is he?
- He's the commander in chief now, sir.

1026
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,735
This is one flight
he shouldn't have been late for.

1027
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,988
- Tell the captain we're taking off.
- You don't have the authority.

1028
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:05,240
Who's got authority?
You've got the authority?

1029
01:12:05,408 --> 01:12:07,284
You couldn't
even keep your mouth shut.

1030
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:09,828
You betrayed top-secret information
last year.

1031
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:12,456
- What are you talking about?
- You told your father...

1032
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:13,957
...put this plan in jeopardy.

1033
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:17,002
Good thing for you the old man
could keep his mouth shut.

1034
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,171
Oh, come on.
Don't look so shocked.

1035
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:22,424
We had to monitor everybody.
How do you think we kept it a secret?

1036
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,927
We just killed anybody
who tried to talk?

1037
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:26,428
Anybody who tried to talk...

1038
01:12:26,596 --> 01:12:29,390
...was not just an enemy of the state,
they're an enemy of humanity.

1039
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:31,809
The director of the Louvre,
an enemy of humanity?

1040
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:33,977
After he called a press conference
he was!

1041
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,022
Jesus. What did you think?

1042
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:41,276
We're all just gonna get on board,
hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"?

1043
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:43,779
Sit down and buckle up.

1044
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:56,083
Oh, excuse me.
is my father in the command center?

1045
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:58,669
President's on the line, Dr. Wilson.

1046
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,380
Thank you.

1047
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:09,179
Where are you?

1048
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:13,308
You never would have gotten
on that plane if I told you.

1049
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,021
But you said that you'd be...

1050
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:18,897
Darling, listen to me.

1051
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:21,734
Do you understand
how much strength it gives me...

1052
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:24,069
...knowing that you'll survive?

1053
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,990
The only thing left to do now...

1054
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:31,452
...is tell the truth to people.

1055
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,580
At least if they know...

1056
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:40,336
...families can say goodbye
to each other.

1057
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:44,381
A mother can comfort her children.

1058
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,177
And a father...

1059
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:53,265
...can ask his daughter
for forgiveness.

1060
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:04,860
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. President.

1061
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,329
My fellow Americans...

1062
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:19,375
...this will be the last time
I address you.

1063
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:21,418
As you know...

1064
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:25,422
...catastrophe has struck
our nation...

1065
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:28,717
...has struck the world.

1066
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:30,719
I wish I could tell you...

1067
01:14:31,262 --> 01:14:34,390
...we could prevent
the coming destruction.

1068
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:36,475
We cannot.

1069
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:39,603
Today, none of us are strangers.

1070
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,231
Today...

1071
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:47,611
...we are one family
stepping into the darkness together.

1072
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:50,989
We are a nation of many religions...

1073
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:57,329
...but I believe these words
reflect the spirit of all of our faiths:

1074
01:14:58,164 --> 01:15:01,291
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall...

1075
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:05,921
People! Keep away
from the doors and windows.

1076
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:08,257
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1077
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:09,633
Dr. Silberman.

1078
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:12,845
- Tamara.
- What are you doing here?

1079
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:15,681
- Excuse me.
- She's a patient, honey.

1080
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:18,642
Excuse me,
I have a private plane out there.

1081
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,102
- Karpov!
- We need help.

1082
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:21,687
- Yuri!
- Takeoffs are canceled.

1083
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:24,481
- Curtis, you're...
- You knew. This whole time you knew.

1084
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:27,526
So you've got a way out of here, right?
You got a plane?

1085
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:29,820
My family, take us with.
Please. Please.

1086
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:31,780
Boss. Boss.

1087
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:33,907
I found us a plane, an Antonov.

1088
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:36,785
They were about to take off,
but the tower didn't let them.

1089
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:39,204
But can you still fly that thing?

1090
01:15:39,372 --> 01:15:42,166
Sure, boss. But I need copilot.

1091
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,294
Gordon's a pilot.

1092
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:47,880
No, I'm not. I'm not.

1093
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:50,049
Yes, he is. Great pilot. Let's go.

1094
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:52,634
Good. Let's go!

1095
01:15:52,802 --> 01:15:55,554
Honey, this is...
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

1096
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:58,057
Hey! Hey, stop!

1097
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,642
You can't go out there. Come back!

1098
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:07,483
Move back, people.

1099
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:09,151
Get away from the glass!

1100
01:16:13,823 --> 01:16:15,824
Wow, that's a big plane.

1101
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:18,827
It's Russian.

1102
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,330
- Let's move, everybody. Come on.
- Run!

1103
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:23,832
- Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Boys, come on.

1104
01:16:27,003 --> 01:16:28,921
- Gordon, where are you?
- Where did you go?

1105
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:32,049
I'm up here in the cockpit.
Hurry up.

1106
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,843
Oh, my God. Not again.

1107
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:44,311
Whoa, look at these.

1108
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:46,855
Las Vegas Auto Show.

1109
01:16:47,023 --> 01:16:49,191
We had VIP tickets for that.

1110
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:51,068
That's fantastic. Let's go.

1111
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:54,154
Check the main bus for hydraulics,
I'll balance the tanks.

1112
01:16:54,322 --> 01:16:55,656
What?

1113
01:16:57,242 --> 01:16:59,910
Okay, okay, okay. I'm trying, okay?
I'm trying.

1114
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:03,122
Tower to Antonov.
What are you doing?

1115
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:05,040
Shut down immediately.

1116
01:17:12,382 --> 01:17:13,716
Caesar.

1117
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:17,136
Okay, when I say go,
you push all this down at once, okay?

1118
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:18,387
- Okay.
- Go!

1119
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:21,890
Antonov, abort takeoff.
You do not have clearance.

1120
01:17:22,058 --> 01:17:24,893
You must abort.
I repeat, you must abort.

1121
01:17:25,061 --> 01:17:26,103
No!

1122
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:35,070
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

1123
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:39,283
- Push.
- Pushing.

1124
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:40,993
Come on!

1125
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,832
We're going down!
We're going down!

1126
01:17:53,381 --> 01:17:55,758
Where are the flaps?
The flaps are not down.

1127
01:17:55,925 --> 01:17:57,885
It must be the pumps. Take over.

1128
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,637
Take over?
What do you mean, take over?

1129
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,099
- Sasha!
- Relax!

1130
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:05,309
Sit down!

1131
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:12,149
God. God. Jesus.

1132
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,612
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I think I got it.

1133
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,531
- Sasha, now!
- Okay, okay. Take a deep breath.

1134
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,950
Pull!

1135
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:26,622
Come on, baby.
Lift your big ass for Sasha!

1136
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,128
- Pull! Pull!
- Come on.

1137
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:46,475
Mommy.

1138
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:50,479
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1139
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,648
I think so.

1140
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:01,907
Ladies and gentlemen...

1141
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:05,077
...we are on our way to China.

1142
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:10,040
Good. That is good, huh?

1143
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:24,346
Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.

1144
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,225
But, great Lama,
Tenzin is my brother.

1145
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:32,229
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

1146
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:39,778
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

1147
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:42,823
What if our world
is indeed coming to an end?

1148
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:56,211
it is full, great Rinpoche.

1149
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,052
Like this cup...

1150
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:07,723
...you are full of opinions
and speculations.

1151
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,393
To see the light of wisdom...

1152
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,605
...you first must empty your cup.

1153
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:33,749
Be careful with the clutch.

1154
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,585
it tends to slip.

1155
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:57,940
- Grandma.
- Grandpa, Nima is here!

1156
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,275
Grandma,
I got a message from Tenzin.

1157
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:03,445
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

1158
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:07,116
He says he can get us on the ships
he's working on.

1159
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:11,370
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

1160
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,291
Grandma...

1161
01:21:16,876 --> 01:21:20,254
...the dam is a ship!
The government lied to us.

1162
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:22,673
There will be a big flood!

1163
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:24,800
We must pack up right away.

1164
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:27,720
Nima, he gave you the truck?

1165
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,640
We took a trip
on the Laem Song ferry once.

1166
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,852
Grandpa threw up the whole way.

1167
01:21:36,354 --> 01:21:37,646
Let's eat first.

1168
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,112
Hey, look. The new Bentley.

1169
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,281
Our father had one on order.

1170
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,533
We were supposed
to get it next year.

1171
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:52,202
But then he canceled it
because of the ships.

1172
01:21:53,204 --> 01:21:55,956
How many cars
does your family have?

1173
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,125
My mom's boyfriend
has a Porsche.

1174
01:21:59,669 --> 01:22:01,462
Our parents are divorced too.

1175
01:22:01,629 --> 01:22:04,006
Yeah, but there's nothing
we can do about that.

1176
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:05,966
Found a hat.

1177
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:07,384
She has a thing for hats.

1178
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:10,512
I was just like that at her age.

1179
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,348
They made me feel safe.

1180
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,518
So how did you meet Dr. Silberman?

1181
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:20,647
As you can see,
not the same way you did.

1182
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,861
My boyfriend asked me
to get them done.

1183
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:27,279
He's not your husband?

1184
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:31,909
Oh, no. We are not married.
And probably never will.

1185
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:41,418
For the boys.

1186
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:48,175
They seem to like each other, huh?

1187
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:50,219
She is adorable.

1188
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:52,429
Yeah, I guess.

1189
01:22:53,723 --> 01:22:56,809
So tell me, Mr. Karpov,
how much did you pay?

1190
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:01,522
One billion euro. Per seat.

1191
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:05,651
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

1192
01:23:06,528 --> 01:23:10,280
You know, Curtis,
I wasn't always businessman.

1193
01:23:10,448 --> 01:23:12,658
I am a boxer.

1194
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:16,453
Was my only playing
when I was boy back in Murmansk.

1195
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:21,041
And my coach,
his name was also Yuri.

1196
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:22,751
He always said:

1197
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:29,717
"If someone wants to beat you,
he has to kill you first. "

1198
01:23:32,762 --> 01:23:34,346
That's very nice.

1199
01:23:34,514 --> 01:23:35,639
Yeah.

1200
01:23:35,932 --> 01:23:41,520
But tell me, what would you have done
if you rich like me?

1201
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:45,566
Look.
They are wonderful children, huh?

1202
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,318
Okay, guys.

1203
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:51,405
The plan is to refuel in Hawaii,
so sit down and buckle up.

1204
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:54,283
Gordon and I will do the rwst.

1205
01:23:56,953 --> 01:23:57,995
Oh, God.

1206
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,623
Go get the guys.

1207
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,671
Guys, there's a...
You might wanna...

1208
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:28,525
What is that?

1209
01:24:28,985 --> 01:24:30,819
The state of Hawaii.

1210
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:35,240
Not good. That is not good.

1211
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,081
How much fuel do we have left?

1212
01:24:42,248 --> 01:24:45,501
Not enough. We're going to
have to make a water landing...

1213
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:47,670
...somewherw in South China Sea.

1214
01:24:47,837 --> 01:24:50,422
Great. At least we're not gonna need
the landing gear.

1215
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:53,717
- What about it?
- Oh, we lost it all. in Vegas.

1216
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,855
Dr. Wilson, may I come in?

1217
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:11,193
I'm not very good company,
I'm afraid, Dr...?

1218
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,946
Please, call me Adrian.

1219
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:22,079
All those people we left behind...

1220
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:25,165
...they don't stand a chance,
do they?

1221
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:30,379
I believe that nature
will choose for itself from itself...

1222
01:25:30,547 --> 01:25:31,714
...what will survive.

1223
01:25:33,842 --> 01:25:37,219
Just like you
preserving those great artworks.

1224
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:41,140
Our culture is our soul,
and that's not dying tonight.

1225
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:42,975
Oh, come on.

1226
01:25:43,476 --> 01:25:45,811
I contributed to this cover-up.

1227
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:49,064
And Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in.

1228
01:25:49,232 --> 01:25:51,525
But you're some nobody,
you don't stand a chance.

1229
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:52,901
That's not...

1230
01:25:53,653 --> 01:25:56,030
That's not necessarily true.

1231
01:25:56,573 --> 01:26:00,909
You ever hear of a writer
called Jackson Curtis?

1232
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:03,287
Wrote a book, Farewell Atlantis.

1233
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:06,498
What do you think the chances are
of an unknown writer...

1234
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:10,502
...who barely sold 500 copies,
making it aboard this plane?

1235
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:12,546
I don't understand.

1236
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:16,884
I mean, call it chance or fate or nature.
it doesn't matter.

1237
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:20,596
This book is part of our legacy now.
Why?

1238
01:26:21,014 --> 01:26:22,931
Because I'm reading it.

1239
01:26:26,603 --> 01:26:30,147
Dr. Helmsley, please report
to the Situation Room immediately.

1240
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:47,081
Hello. I'm sorry. Who is this?

1241
01:26:47,248 --> 01:26:51,043
This is Yoko Delgatto.
Do you wanna speak to my daddy?

1242
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:56,048
Yes, please.

1243
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,467
Who should I say is calling?

1244
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:04,598
Tell him it's his father.

1245
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:06,642
You're my grandpa?

1246
01:27:07,727 --> 01:27:10,062
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

1247
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,858
Daddy, Daddy,
Grandpa's on the phone.

1248
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:19,131
Mr. President, sir.

1249
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:25,637
Mr. President.

1250
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,892
- What's the matter, sweetie?
- She can't find her daddy.

1251
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:34,563
Why don't you two
get comfy on that couch?

1252
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:37,524
Sally, come help them out, okay?

1253
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:40,819
I'll find your daddy.

1254
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,245
Who can help me
with missing persons?

1255
01:28:50,413 --> 01:28:52,956
Sorry, man.
I'm really busy right now.

1256
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:57,086
I mean... Of course, sir.
Sorry, Mr. President.

1257
01:28:57,253 --> 01:29:00,047
Don't worry about it.
You're doing a great job, son.

1258
01:29:26,282 --> 01:29:28,617
- What?
- The capital's been hit by a 9.4.

1259
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,119
We've lost communication.

1260
01:29:30,286 --> 01:29:33,330
- Where's it centered?
- North Chesapeake Bay.

1261
01:29:37,043 --> 01:29:40,713
Mr. Anheuser, the Russian president's
on the line, sir.

1262
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,922
Excuse me.

1263
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:45,300
We just entered Chinese airspace.

1264
01:29:46,594 --> 01:29:48,470
That's affirmative, Mr. President.

1265
01:29:48,638 --> 01:29:53,350
Until communication is restored,
I suppose I am in command.

1266
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:56,895
it appears that all other
heads of state are en route...

1267
01:29:57,063 --> 01:29:59,690
...with the exception
of the Italian prime minister...

1268
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:04,737
...who has also decided
to stay behind and trust in prayer.

1269
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:14,264
The Earth's crust has begun to shift,
Dr. Helmsley.

1270
01:31:14,432 --> 01:31:17,643
- By what degree?
-1.2 degrees, but it's still moving.

1271
01:31:17,811 --> 01:31:19,103
So, what happens next?

1272
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:21,772
Once the movement
of our land masses comes to a halt...

1273
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,732
Let's see a simulation, Scotty.

1274
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,151
...expect the formation
of gigantic tsunamis...

1275
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:29,613
...proportional to the magnitude
of the corresponding quakes.

1276
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:36,662
Pull up the Japanese seaboard,
will you?

1277
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,455
Yes, sir.

1278
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,834
My dad's on a cruise ship out here.

1279
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:45,462
But I guess you already
knew that, huh?

1280
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:49,925
Sir, we recorded
two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2.

1281
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:08,986
From what we have just learned...

1282
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:12,197
...Tokyo seems to have taken
the full force of the earthquake.

1283
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:14,616
At this point,
unconfirmed reports indicate...

1284
01:32:14,784 --> 01:32:17,703
...that large areas of land
are underwater.

1285
01:32:17,871 --> 01:32:20,039
Please stay tuned for further...

1286
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:31,425
Tony...

1287
01:32:31,968 --> 01:32:33,552
I called.

1288
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,932
I was too late.

1289
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,648
Maybe they got out in time.

1290
01:32:46,816 --> 01:32:48,817
You never know. They...

1291
01:33:17,097 --> 01:33:18,472
Harry!

1292
01:34:16,072 --> 01:34:18,741
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

1293
01:34:45,143 --> 01:34:46,602
Anything?

1294
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:51,565
Nothing. Just static.
Not even an emergency signal.

1295
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:06,997
Can't think about
what's going on down there.

1296
01:35:14,422 --> 01:35:16,423
Remember that old Beetle
we used to camp in?

1297
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:18,467
We could never get the roof up.

1298
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:20,219
Yeah.

1299
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,304
We definitely traded up.

1300
01:35:25,266 --> 01:35:27,267
Tried to find our old spot
at Yellowstone...

1301
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:29,645
...when I went camping
with the kids...

1302
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:32,564
...but I couldn't find it.

1303
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,825
Do you think people change?

1304
01:35:43,785 --> 01:35:45,494
By "people," do you mean me?

1305
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:48,914
Yes. Do you think you've changed
since we separated?

1306
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:53,002
I certainly eat a lot more cereal now.

1307
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:59,717
You always had tunnel vision.

1308
01:36:00,468 --> 01:36:03,637
You could just block everything out
and write.

1309
01:36:07,225 --> 01:36:09,018
You blocked us out.

1310
01:36:18,486 --> 01:36:19,903
Do you love him?

1311
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:24,575
I love him enough.

1312
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:40,299
All global ground communication
has ceased, sir.

1313
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:46,347
The only signals our satellites
are picking up...

1314
01:36:46,514 --> 01:36:48,891
...are coming from the vessels
in Cho Ming.

1315
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:51,643
Well, there's a piece of good news.

1316
01:36:51,811 --> 01:36:53,062
Any updates, doctor?

1317
01:36:53,229 --> 01:36:56,398
We expect the tsunamis
to reach landfall in every continent.

1318
01:36:56,566 --> 01:37:00,069
The Cho Ming area will be impacted
in approximately six hours.

1319
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:04,865
it looks like the crust has shifted
by almost 23 degrees...

1320
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:06,825
...to the southwest.

1321
01:37:07,035 --> 01:37:11,914
The data also shows the Earth's poles
have reversed their magnetic fields.

1322
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,499
These are their new positions.

1323
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:15,918
So you're...

1324
01:37:16,711 --> 01:37:19,129
You're telling me
that the North Pole...

1325
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:21,924
...is now somewhere in Wisconsin?

1326
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,426
Actually, that's the South Pole now.

1327
01:37:33,186 --> 01:37:35,479
Engine failure.
Two of the six are down.

1328
01:37:35,647 --> 01:37:37,564
We must get ready.

1329
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,528
- How long do we have?
- Fifteen minutes. Maybe.

1330
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:46,990
- Better wake up the kids.
- Yeah.

1331
01:38:26,531 --> 01:38:28,657
Why do you hate Gordon?

1332
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:34,288
Hey.

1333
01:38:34,664 --> 01:38:36,248
Come on.

1334
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,668
What are you talking about?

1335
01:38:39,836 --> 01:38:41,170
I don't hate him.

1336
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:42,921
Well, you don't like him, either.

1337
01:38:43,506 --> 01:38:46,258
Well, that's just because
I don't know him that well, maybe.

1338
01:38:46,426 --> 01:38:47,718
Yeah, but I do.

1339
01:38:47,886 --> 01:38:50,179
He's really nice
once you get to know him.

1340
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:51,972
You should talk to him more often.

1341
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:55,017
You guys would get along
really, really well.

1342
01:38:58,438 --> 01:39:00,230
You like him a lot, huh?

1343
01:39:08,865 --> 01:39:10,574
I'll do my best, I promise.

1344
01:39:11,034 --> 01:39:12,409
Okay?

1345
01:39:13,578 --> 01:39:17,456
I'm really proud of you.
Really, really proud of you.

1346
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,376
is it time?

1347
01:39:22,295 --> 01:39:23,587
Yeah.

1348
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,635
- Dad, what's wrong?
- Well, Sasha said we gotta land...

1349
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:33,514
...and it's gonna be a little bumpy
and maybe a little wet.

1350
01:39:33,682 --> 01:39:34,723
Daddy?

1351
01:39:41,106 --> 01:39:42,314
Hold her steady.

1352
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:02,710
Daddy,
I'm not a really good swimmer.

1353
01:40:02,877 --> 01:40:06,964
Hey, no, that's all right.
That's what you got this for. Right?

1354
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:10,217
it's like being in a swimming pool,
only it's got more cool stuff.

1355
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:13,637
Look, it's got a whistle,
and a light thing. Right?

1356
01:40:13,805 --> 01:40:15,931
I thought we were going to China.

1357
01:40:16,933 --> 01:40:19,018
No, we gotta land here.

1358
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:24,273
So we're just all gonna
stay together, right?

1359
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:27,401
- No, we're not, we're gonna die.
- No. We're not.

1360
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:29,570
Promise?

1361
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:31,822
I promise you
we're gonna all stay together...

1362
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:35,617
...no matter what happens, okay?

1363
01:40:48,798 --> 01:40:50,257
Jackson.

1364
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,134
Yuri.

1365
01:40:53,303 --> 01:40:55,095
I think you better come up here.

1366
01:40:55,805 --> 01:40:57,264
I'm gonna go check this out.

1367
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:59,433
- Dad. Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1368
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:02,519
- You said you'd stay with us.
- We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

1369
01:41:03,813 --> 01:41:06,023
Okay, don't ask me
how that happened...

1370
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:07,649
...but there is no more ocean...

1371
01:41:07,817 --> 01:41:09,860
...and we're close
to where we wanted to go.

1372
01:41:10,028 --> 01:41:12,237
it's like the world shifted
by 1000 miles.

1373
01:41:12,405 --> 01:41:14,990
One thousand five hundrwd
and seventy-eight to be exact.

1374
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:17,534
it's called
Earth Crust Displacement Theory.

1375
01:41:17,744 --> 01:41:19,828
Professor Hapgood, 1958.

1376
01:41:20,705 --> 01:41:21,747
Way to go, Charlie.

1377
01:41:25,835 --> 01:41:27,169
What was that?

1378
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:30,381
We just lost our last two engines.

1379
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:52,277
I'm gonna shoot for that glacier.
it's gonna get rocky.

1380
01:41:52,445 --> 01:41:56,699
Listen, this is gonna sound crazy,
but here's what you have to do.

1381
01:42:00,328 --> 01:42:02,496
Unbuckle.
Come on, come on, come on.

1382
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,916
Yuri! What are we doing?

1383
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:08,585
We are taking the Bentley.

1384
01:42:10,171 --> 01:42:12,715
Not yet. Not yet.

1385
01:42:12,882 --> 01:42:14,425
it has to be perfect.

1386
01:42:14,592 --> 01:42:16,176
Almost there.

1387
01:42:16,344 --> 01:42:18,887
- Come on.
- Get in the car.

1388
01:42:28,898 --> 01:42:31,650
Okay, go. Now. Pull.

1389
01:42:36,573 --> 01:42:39,074
No, no, no!

1390
01:42:42,078 --> 01:42:43,495
Go. Go, Jackson.

1391
01:42:43,663 --> 01:42:46,165
No, we gotta wait
for Sasha and Gordon.

1392
01:42:46,332 --> 01:42:49,960
Go. Make sure everybody gets out
of the plane before I touch down.

1393
01:42:50,128 --> 01:42:51,170
What about you?

1394
01:42:51,338 --> 01:42:55,841
I'll be fine.
I have to touch this baby down.

1395
01:42:56,551 --> 01:42:58,260
What are you waiting for?

1396
01:42:58,428 --> 01:43:01,180
Go! Go!

1397
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:16,987
There he is. I see him.

1398
01:43:17,155 --> 01:43:19,740
- Wherw is Sasha? Wherw is Sasha?
- Come on. Let's go.

1399
01:43:19,908 --> 01:43:23,035
He said he's fine. We should get
out of here before he touches down.

1400
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:25,371
No, no, no. Don't go.
We have to wait for him.

1401
01:43:25,914 --> 01:43:27,831
Go, Jackson. Go.

1402
01:43:27,999 --> 01:43:31,669
- Don't go!
- it won't start. it won't start.

1403
01:43:31,836 --> 01:43:35,339
Just shut up, everybody!

1404
01:43:36,299 --> 01:43:37,758
Engine...

1405
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:39,551
...start.

1406
01:43:42,972 --> 01:43:45,391
Voice control. Sold me on it.

1407
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,868
Hey! Hey!

1408
01:45:48,765 --> 01:45:50,974
Welcome to
the People's Republic of China.

1409
01:45:51,559 --> 01:45:53,727
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

1410
01:45:53,895 --> 01:45:54,978
- Hi.
- Hi.

1411
01:45:55,146 --> 01:45:56,772
What color are your passes?

1412
01:45:58,441 --> 01:46:00,984
What color
are your boarding passes?

1413
01:46:02,696 --> 01:46:03,862
I have green card.

1414
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:06,949
For my boys and me.

1415
01:46:07,117 --> 01:46:08,617
What?

1416
01:46:12,038 --> 01:46:14,206
Yuri. Yuri.

1417
01:46:14,374 --> 01:46:17,751
Yuri, it's a mistake. A joke, right?

1418
01:46:17,919 --> 01:46:19,420
What?

1419
01:46:19,754 --> 01:46:23,132
You think I didn't know
about you and Sasha?

1420
01:46:24,884 --> 01:46:27,928
May God bless
that poor bastard's soul.

1421
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,395
I'm sorry, guys. Good luck.

1422
01:46:37,814 --> 01:46:39,565
Come on, boys.

1423
01:46:41,192 --> 01:46:43,235
- Does anybody have any money?
- I do, I do.

1424
01:46:43,403 --> 01:46:44,862
You got a billion euros?

1425
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:50,909
Dr. Wilson?

1426
01:46:51,828 --> 01:46:54,413
I'm Captain Michaels,
skipper of the American ship.

1427
01:46:54,581 --> 01:46:56,832
Please accept my condolences
for your father.

1428
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,751
Thank you, captain.

1429
01:47:00,128 --> 01:47:02,880
Mr. Anheuser,
your party is the last to arrive.

1430
01:47:07,135 --> 01:47:09,470
There've been reports
of severe damage, captain.

1431
01:47:09,637 --> 01:47:11,513
What's the status of Ark Number 3?

1432
01:47:11,681 --> 01:47:14,016
We haven't done
a complete assessment yet...

1433
01:47:14,184 --> 01:47:16,477
...but it looks like we lost it.

1434
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:28,697
No toothbrush. Only books.

1435
01:47:29,616 --> 01:47:33,035
Yeah, when I was a kid,
my dad was on the road a lot.

1436
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:35,913
He would always leave me
a box full of books...

1437
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:38,040
...call me every night and quiz me.

1438
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:41,585
I'd get an ice-cream cone
for every book I read...

1439
01:47:41,753 --> 01:47:42,920
...so I was a fat kid.

1440
01:47:44,547 --> 01:47:46,215
I find that very hard to believe.

1441
01:47:46,383 --> 01:47:47,633
No, it's true.

1442
01:47:47,801 --> 01:47:51,303
My high school career
was 2000 books...

1443
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,180
...and zero girlfriends.

1444
01:47:54,641 --> 01:47:57,559
I didn't even kiss a boy
till I was in college.

1445
01:47:57,936 --> 01:48:00,396
They were all too scared
of my dad.

1446
01:48:47,944 --> 01:48:49,778
Leave it to the Chinese.

1447
01:48:49,946 --> 01:48:51,780
I didn't think it was possible.

1448
01:48:51,948 --> 01:48:53,615
Not in the time we had.

1449
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,659
That's Ark Number 3, sir.

1450
01:48:56,578 --> 01:48:59,872
The roof collapsed on it
during the shifting of the Earth's crust.

1451
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:02,291
Jesus Christ.

1452
01:49:03,501 --> 01:49:06,962
Boarding of Ark Number 3 will be
delayed due to technical difficulties.

1453
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:08,630
- Excuse me.
- We paid a fortune!

1454
01:49:08,798 --> 01:49:11,800
Please be patient
as we keep you updated.

1455
01:49:11,968 --> 01:49:13,802
Hey, what's going on here?

1456
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:16,513
I have a green card
for my boys and me.

1457
01:49:16,723 --> 01:49:18,766
I want to speak to a supervisor.

1458
01:49:18,933 --> 01:49:20,059
I am the supervisor.

1459
01:49:20,226 --> 01:49:23,771
Get back with the other green cards
or I'll have you detained.

1460
01:49:25,732 --> 01:49:27,900
What he said about you and Sasha,
is it true?

1461
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:31,820
Sasha was worth
100 times a man like Yuri.

1462
01:49:31,988 --> 01:49:34,406
I should have listened to you,
Dr. Silberman.

1463
01:49:34,574 --> 01:49:39,536
I actually liked the way I looked
before that monster talked me into it.

1464
01:49:39,704 --> 01:49:41,997
Did you know he asked me
for a discount?

1465
01:49:42,165 --> 01:49:44,124
And he paid in installments.

1466
01:49:44,292 --> 01:49:45,876
Cheap bastard.

1467
01:49:46,044 --> 01:49:47,628
You hear that?

1468
01:49:50,382 --> 01:49:52,257
Over therw!

1469
01:49:53,802 --> 01:49:55,344
- Hey!
- Hey!

1470
01:49:55,512 --> 01:49:57,721
- Stop! Stop! Please!
- Hey! Hold it!

1471
01:50:01,726 --> 01:50:03,477
Hey! Hey!

1472
01:50:03,978 --> 01:50:06,730
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1473
01:50:08,024 --> 01:50:09,650
Help!

1474
01:50:18,993 --> 01:50:20,119
Hey!

1475
01:50:39,472 --> 01:50:41,056
How were all these people chosen?

1476
01:50:41,224 --> 01:50:43,892
Same way your art was:
By experts from all over the world.

1477
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:47,062
We had geneticists determine
the perfect gene pool to repopulate.

1478
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:49,064
These people
were chosen by geneticists?

1479
01:50:49,232 --> 01:50:52,609
All green-card holders,
please proceed to Gallery D-4.

1480
01:50:52,777 --> 01:50:54,945
Looks like their checkbooks
got them onboard.

1481
01:50:55,113 --> 01:50:58,073
Right. Without billions of dollars
from the private sector...

1482
01:50:58,241 --> 01:50:59,908
...this would've been impossible.

1483
01:51:00,076 --> 01:51:02,161
We sold tickets.

1484
01:51:02,328 --> 01:51:05,789
And what about all these workers?
They all get passes?

1485
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:10,377
What, life isn't fair? is that it?

1486
01:51:10,545 --> 01:51:13,464
You wanna donate your passes
to a couple of Chinese workers...

1487
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:15,549
...you be my guest.

1488
01:51:16,009 --> 01:51:19,553
Captain, I want a prelaunch briefing.
All international teams present.

1489
01:51:54,714 --> 01:51:56,548
What the hell?

1490
01:51:59,719 --> 01:52:03,389
What is this?
You could fit 10 people in here.

1491
01:52:10,146 --> 01:52:11,480
Satnam, where are you?

1492
01:52:11,648 --> 01:52:14,441
- On the Nampan Plateau.
- What?

1493
01:52:15,652 --> 01:52:17,986
There's a tidal wave
coming from the east.

1494
01:52:18,154 --> 01:52:21,323
- it's gigantic.
- Satnam, what happened?

1495
01:52:21,491 --> 01:52:23,617
We never got picked up, Adrian.

1496
01:52:23,785 --> 01:52:25,994
The airlift never came.

1497
01:52:27,497 --> 01:52:29,248
Goodbye, my friend.

1498
01:52:29,874 --> 01:52:35,796
Satnam.

1499
01:52:57,694 --> 01:53:00,612
- The flooding is coming this way?
- Mary. Where are we set up?

1500
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,239
Over therw.

1501
01:53:05,869 --> 01:53:07,995
Get me the satellite images
from Nampan, India.

1502
01:53:08,163 --> 01:53:09,872
- Okay, right away.
- What's happening?

1503
01:53:11,166 --> 01:53:13,792
No. Satnam was talking
about another wave...

1504
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,461
...coming from the east.

1505
01:53:19,049 --> 01:53:21,508
- Holy mother.
- The flooding is gonna hit earlier?

1506
01:53:21,676 --> 01:53:24,386
is that what you're telling me?
The second wave is closer?

1507
01:53:24,554 --> 01:53:26,513
- Plug in the new data.
- Okay.

1508
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:29,933
- Satnam didn't get picked up.
- What?

1509
01:53:30,352 --> 01:53:33,187
A lot of people didn't get picked up
in this chaos.

1510
01:53:33,355 --> 01:53:34,980
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley.

1511
01:53:35,398 --> 01:53:38,442
Your predictions haven't exactly
panned out, have they, doctor?

1512
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:40,527
it's ready. it's ready.

1513
01:53:42,447 --> 01:53:44,448
Oh, God. it's 1500 meters high.

1514
01:53:45,992 --> 01:53:49,161
When's it gonna get here? Talk to me,
Helmsley. When's it gonna hit?

1515
01:53:49,329 --> 01:53:50,996
Adjust the countdown.

1516
01:54:07,138 --> 01:54:10,015
Twenty-eight minutes,
10 seconds to impact.

1517
01:54:10,183 --> 01:54:11,433
Oh, my God.

1518
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:15,062
Captain, I need to speak to the other
heads of state immediately.

1519
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:18,023
- Right away. Taylor?
- Aye, captain. Standing by.

1520
01:54:18,191 --> 01:54:20,776
Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by.

1521
01:54:20,944 --> 01:54:23,612
- Carl Anheuser, acting CIC, Ark 4.
- Yes, sir.

1522
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:26,073
Requesting emergency conference,
T-99.

1523
01:54:47,095 --> 01:54:49,555
He thinks the world of you,
you know that?

1524
01:54:51,474 --> 01:54:53,225
He's a great little man.

1525
01:54:54,102 --> 01:54:55,644
Yeah.

1526
01:55:03,653 --> 01:55:06,280
I always wanted to have a family
of my own.

1527
01:55:09,868 --> 01:55:12,119
You're a lucky man, Jackson.

1528
01:55:12,787 --> 01:55:14,663
Don't ever forget it.

1529
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,764
Who are they?

1530
01:55:31,931 --> 01:55:33,640
We found them along side
of the road.

1531
01:55:34,309 --> 01:55:35,351
Send them back!

1532
01:55:41,858 --> 01:55:43,400
I am a follower...

1533
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:46,028
...of our great Lama Rinpoche.

1534
01:55:46,821 --> 01:55:48,238
You know I cannot do that.

1535
01:55:48,406 --> 01:55:49,948
What's the problem?

1536
01:55:50,116 --> 01:55:51,784
You don't have to take all of us.

1537
01:55:51,951 --> 01:55:53,911
Just take my children.
I'm begging you.

1538
01:55:54,412 --> 01:55:56,080
Why should I do that?

1539
01:55:56,247 --> 01:55:59,458
The same reason
you sent for your family.

1540
01:55:59,626 --> 01:56:00,668
Please.

1541
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:03,253
Just the children.
You don't have to take us.

1542
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:04,546
Please!

1543
01:56:07,384 --> 01:56:09,551
Please. Oh, my God.

1544
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:17,059
Please. I don't know
if you can understand what I'm saying.

1545
01:56:17,227 --> 01:56:19,311
As a mother, I'm begging you.

1546
01:56:19,479 --> 01:56:21,230
Please take them.

1547
01:56:22,107 --> 01:56:23,482
Please.

1548
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:29,655
We are all children of the earth.

1549
01:56:29,823 --> 01:56:33,325
My plan will not work for so many,
Grandma.

1550
01:56:33,493 --> 01:56:37,413
We will take them all.

1551
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:41,667
Please.

1552
01:56:43,586 --> 01:56:46,296
Thank you. Thank you.

1553
01:56:53,263 --> 01:56:56,098
Attention: All construction workers,
off deck.

1554
01:56:56,516 --> 01:56:59,393
All crew members, onboard now.

1555
01:56:59,561 --> 01:57:01,311
They're opening the mountain.

1556
01:57:01,771 --> 01:57:04,523
They are leaving without us.

1557
01:57:04,691 --> 01:57:07,985
Step back. Get back.
What did I tell you?

1558
01:57:08,153 --> 01:57:11,071
They are leaving you behind too.
Look, idiot.

1559
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:13,323
Please be patient.

1560
01:57:15,952 --> 01:57:17,453
Let's go.

1561
01:57:20,498 --> 01:57:27,171
Follow me.

1562
01:57:33,803 --> 01:57:34,928
We have to hurry!

1563
01:57:35,555 --> 01:57:36,764
They are leaving!

1564
01:57:39,434 --> 01:57:41,435
initiate security procedures.

1565
01:57:41,603 --> 01:57:46,231
Time to impact:
17 minutes, 42 seconds.

1566
01:57:47,233 --> 01:57:49,777
Oh, excuse me.
Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

1567
01:57:49,944 --> 01:57:51,362
He's on the bridge. This way.

1568
01:57:55,825 --> 01:57:56,825
Tenzin wait!

1569
01:57:58,411 --> 01:58:00,412
Grandma, we're almost there.

1570
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:02,498
Green lights on pressure,
Mr. Anton?

1571
01:58:02,665 --> 01:58:04,708
Green lights across the board,
captain.

1572
01:58:16,471 --> 01:58:17,846
Why do they have anchors?

1573
01:58:18,014 --> 01:58:21,308
Because they're not spaceships,
buddy. They're arks.

1574
01:58:21,476 --> 01:58:23,060
Let's go.

1575
01:58:35,365 --> 01:58:36,407
Mr. President.

1576
01:58:37,367 --> 01:58:38,450
You've got to see this.

1577
01:59:08,064 --> 01:59:09,106
Stop.

1578
01:59:09,274 --> 01:59:10,899
Stop! Stop!

1579
01:59:12,318 --> 01:59:13,360
Stop!

1580
01:59:19,951 --> 01:59:21,452
Engage the support mechanisms.

1581
01:59:21,619 --> 01:59:23,829
Aye, aye, captain.
Engaging bow-anchor supports.

1582
01:59:23,997 --> 01:59:26,790
How long are these things expecting
to hold us in place?

1583
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:29,918
They're just meant to withstand
the first impact of the waves.

1584
01:59:49,647 --> 01:59:51,982
Down there Oleg, you go first!

1585
01:59:56,488 --> 02:00:15,714
Caesar.

1586
02:00:18,551 --> 02:00:20,010
Good. Good boy.

1587
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:22,638
Come to Mommy. Caesar!

1588
02:00:23,932 --> 02:00:25,808
Mom, where's Tamara?

1589
02:00:28,103 --> 02:00:29,353
Daddy look!

1590
02:00:30,772 --> 02:00:32,856
Come on. Caesar, come on.

1591
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,733
- Tamara!
- I'm coming.

1592
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:44,326
Take him.

1593
02:01:11,062 --> 02:01:12,896
Oh, my God.
What's happening out there?

1594
02:01:13,064 --> 02:01:14,565
Anheuser.

1595
02:01:15,108 --> 02:01:18,694
Anheuser convinced
the other heads of state to launch.

1596
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:23,490
Mr. Anheuser.

1597
02:01:25,201 --> 02:01:27,661
We have to stop this madness.

1598
02:01:28,204 --> 02:01:30,539
Make sure the other bridges
can see me.

1599
02:01:30,874 --> 02:01:34,376
- What do you think you're doing?
- I know what I'm doing. Turn it on.

1600
02:01:35,462 --> 02:01:37,755
Ladies and gentlemen,
this Dr. Adrian Helmsley...

1601
02:01:37,922 --> 02:01:40,549
...chief science advisor
to the late President Wilson.

1602
02:01:40,717 --> 02:01:43,761
Could you please turn up the volume,
Mr. Hoffmann?

1603
02:01:44,012 --> 02:01:46,388
We've all been forced
to make difficult decisions...

1604
02:01:46,556 --> 02:01:48,307
...to save our human civilization.

1605
02:01:48,475 --> 02:01:51,018
But to be human
means to care for each other...

1606
02:01:51,186 --> 02:01:55,105
...and civilization means
to work together to create a better life.

1607
02:01:55,273 --> 02:01:57,733
If that's true,
then there's nothing human...

1608
02:01:57,901 --> 02:02:01,195
...and nothing civilized
about what we're doing here.

1609
02:02:01,363 --> 02:02:03,697
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable.

1610
02:02:03,865 --> 02:02:07,826
But I will remind you that we have very
limited resources and limited time.

1611
02:02:07,994 --> 02:02:12,498
Ask yourselves, can we really stand by
and watch these people die?

1612
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:15,250
I read a quote two days ago.

1613
02:02:15,418 --> 02:02:18,003
The author is probably dead by now,
but he said:

1614
02:02:18,171 --> 02:02:20,381
"The moment we stop fighting
for each other...

1615
02:02:20,548 --> 02:02:23,676
...that's the moment
that we lose our humanity. "

1616
02:02:23,843 --> 02:02:25,177
To save the human race...

1617
02:02:25,345 --> 02:02:27,680
...we have an obligation
to stick to this plan...

1618
02:02:27,847 --> 02:02:30,516
...which every nation on this flotilla
has signed up for.

1619
02:02:30,684 --> 02:02:33,727
- We have to let these people in!
- They're in God's hands now.

1620
02:02:35,397 --> 02:02:37,064
Officer, you turn that off.

1621
02:02:38,942 --> 02:02:40,442
That is an order. Turn it off!

1622
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:42,111
Don't you dare touch that button.

1623
02:02:42,278 --> 02:02:45,114
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1624
02:02:45,281 --> 02:02:48,617
Look at the clock.
We have barely 15 minutes left.

1625
02:02:48,785 --> 02:02:51,787
Do you wanna be responsible
for the extinction of the human race?

1626
02:02:51,955 --> 02:02:53,414
Can you handle that, Adrian?

1627
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:55,749
There's a young astrophysicist
from India...

1628
02:02:55,917 --> 02:02:58,585
- ... who's the reason we're all here.
- Oh, for God's sake.

1629
02:02:59,254 --> 02:03:02,631
He's the one who discovered it all.
He connected all the dots.

1630
02:03:02,799 --> 02:03:05,300
We all owe him our lives.

1631
02:03:05,468 --> 02:03:07,928
I just learned
that he was killed with his family...

1632
02:03:08,096 --> 02:03:10,889
...in a tsunami in eastern India.

1633
02:03:12,809 --> 02:03:14,184
He was my friend.

1634
02:03:15,478 --> 02:03:17,396
And he died in vain.

1635
02:03:18,023 --> 02:03:21,275
Everybody out there
has died in vain...

1636
02:03:21,443 --> 02:03:25,738
...if we start our future
with an act of cruelty.

1637
02:03:26,781 --> 02:03:28,907
What will you tell your children?

1638
02:03:30,326 --> 02:03:32,411
What will they tell theirs?

1639
02:03:34,748 --> 02:03:38,375
If my father were here,
he would open the gates.

1640
02:03:45,675 --> 02:03:47,051
The people of Russia...

1641
02:03:49,262 --> 02:03:50,429
...along with China...

1642
02:03:52,682 --> 02:03:55,684
...and Japan, agree.

1643
02:03:56,728 --> 02:03:58,645
Open the gates.

1644
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:04,735
The United Kingdom,
Spain, France, Canada, Germany...

1645
02:04:04,903 --> 02:04:09,365
...and I believe I may also speak
for the Italian prime minister...

1646
02:04:09,532 --> 02:04:12,284
...we vote to let these people
come in.

1647
02:04:18,375 --> 02:04:20,042
Captain Michaels.

1648
02:04:21,586 --> 02:04:22,753
Please.

1649
02:04:26,675 --> 02:04:28,217
This is the captain.

1650
02:04:28,385 --> 02:04:30,969
in a few moments,
we will open the gates...

1651
02:04:31,137 --> 02:04:32,930
...and get you people in.

1652
02:04:33,098 --> 02:04:36,642
Please step back
and clear the platform.

1653
02:04:39,104 --> 02:04:41,438
P- yew, it stinks.

1654
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:02,751
- They are opening the gates.
- Go. Go.

1655
02:05:02,919 --> 02:05:05,254
Climb! Don't look down! Climb! Go!

1656
02:05:05,422 --> 02:05:07,089
Noah. Noah.

1657
02:05:07,257 --> 02:05:08,424
Get down.

1658
02:05:18,435 --> 02:05:20,227
Mom. Mom, something happened.

1659
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:21,603
Hold on! Hold on!

1660
02:05:24,441 --> 02:05:25,482
Hold on!

1661
02:05:27,902 --> 02:05:30,195
Gordon, hold on, goddamn it!
Give me your hand!

1662
02:05:30,363 --> 02:05:31,905
- Give me your hand. Reach!
- Help!

1663
02:05:32,073 --> 02:05:34,199
- Reach for it! Gordon!
- Please. Please. Please.

1664
02:05:34,868 --> 02:05:36,368
Gordon! Gordon!

1665
02:05:37,495 --> 02:05:38,662
Gordon!

1666
02:05:39,706 --> 02:05:40,956
No!

1667
02:05:41,916 --> 02:05:43,417
God.

1668
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:56,472
Pull me up.

1669
02:05:57,432 --> 02:05:58,849
Come on!

1670
02:06:23,541 --> 02:06:24,875
What's wrong with the gate?

1671
02:06:25,043 --> 02:06:28,045
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle.
We're checking, captain.

1672
02:06:28,755 --> 02:06:29,838
Hold it.

1673
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:31,882
Hold it, people.

1674
02:06:36,471 --> 02:06:39,014
Four minutes to impact.

1675
02:07:22,934 --> 02:07:24,476
Go to the lower deck. Let's go.

1676
02:07:24,644 --> 02:07:27,479
- We are loaded, captain.
- Well, then let's lock it up. Now.

1677
02:07:37,699 --> 02:07:40,743
Oleg. Grab my hand.

1678
02:07:41,161 --> 02:07:42,202
Oleg.

1679
02:07:43,163 --> 02:07:44,455
No, no.

1680
02:07:53,006 --> 02:07:55,841
Papa! Papa!

1681
02:08:00,347 --> 02:08:01,847
Papa!

1682
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:16,487
- Something's jamming the hydraulics.
- Then get it out, for Chris sake.

1683
02:08:16,654 --> 02:08:19,656
I can't fire up the engines
till we get a good seal on that gate.

1684
02:08:19,824 --> 02:08:22,201
Captain, we have a breach
in the zoological bay.

1685
02:08:22,369 --> 02:08:24,661
- Can you zoom in?
- Yeah.

1686
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,833
I know those kids.

1687
02:08:30,001 --> 02:08:32,002
What is happening?
What's going on?

1688
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:34,129
Where did they come from?

1689
02:08:36,091 --> 02:08:37,883
There.
Through the hydraulic chamber.

1690
02:08:38,051 --> 02:08:39,802
Captain,
I think we found the problem.

1691
02:08:39,969 --> 02:08:41,470
- Who are these people?
- No, wait.

1692
02:08:42,472 --> 02:08:44,598
He's injured.
Something must have gone wrong.

1693
02:08:44,766 --> 02:08:47,518
Something must have gone wrong?
Something must have gone...?

1694
02:08:47,686 --> 02:08:50,229
Are you kidding me?
Of course something went wrong!

1695
02:08:50,397 --> 02:08:52,272
You know,
congratulations to both of you.

1696
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:55,984
Might of gotten us killed, but as long
as your conscience is clean.

1697
02:08:56,152 --> 02:08:59,530
Let's get a team down there. I'll meet
them at the hydraulics chamber.

1698
02:08:59,698 --> 02:09:00,864
- You know your way?
- Yeah.

1699
02:09:01,032 --> 02:09:03,951
- Let's go!
- One minute to impact.

1700
02:09:17,674 --> 02:09:21,260
Captain,
Cho Ming Airfield's been hit.

1701
02:09:21,428 --> 02:09:23,178
Put me on emergency com,
Mr. Taylor.

1702
02:09:23,346 --> 02:09:25,681
Aye. You're on, captain.

1703
02:09:25,849 --> 02:09:27,266
This is the captain speaking.

1704
02:09:28,351 --> 02:09:31,020
We expect to be impacted
by water shortly.

1705
02:09:31,187 --> 02:09:33,313
- We need to go this way.
- All new passengers:

1706
02:09:33,481 --> 02:09:35,941
- Hit the deck, brace yourselves.
- Okay, let's go!

1707
02:09:36,109 --> 02:09:39,111
Excuse me. Excuse us. Excuse us.
Brace yourselves!

1708
02:09:39,279 --> 02:09:40,487
Coming through, excuse me.

1709
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:56,837
All stations, prepare for impact.

1710
02:10:27,077 --> 02:10:28,535
Come on, boys. Go, go, go!

1711
02:10:28,703 --> 02:10:31,163
This way! Let's go! Go, go!

1712
02:10:42,592 --> 02:10:44,843
Collision pressure
just below 80 pascal, captain.

1713
02:10:45,011 --> 02:10:47,554
0.2 mil surface compression
on bow sensors, captain.

1714
02:10:47,722 --> 02:10:51,058
- All right, track Dr. Helmsley.
- There.

1715
02:10:53,186 --> 02:10:54,228
Come on.

1716
02:10:54,396 --> 02:10:55,854
- I got you!
- Get out of the way!

1717
02:10:56,022 --> 02:10:57,898
- We have to get through here.
- Excuse me.

1718
02:10:59,109 --> 02:11:00,984
Tenzin, almost there.

1719
02:11:02,112 --> 02:11:03,654
Nima, what happened?

1720
02:11:05,740 --> 02:11:08,784
Tamara. Will you take the kids
to the stairs, please?

1721
02:11:09,494 --> 02:11:12,496
- Which way?
- We can't get there.

1722
02:11:12,664 --> 02:11:14,957
Water has penetrated the stern.

1723
02:11:15,125 --> 02:11:18,711
The rear of the ship is starting to seal
itself up one compartment at a time!

1724
02:11:19,546 --> 02:11:21,296
Wherw's Gordon?

1725
02:11:22,132 --> 02:11:23,215
No?

1726
02:11:23,758 --> 02:11:25,134
No.

1727
02:11:25,301 --> 02:11:29,346
We gotta go back. We gotta go back!
We need to go back!

1728
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:33,308
- No! Lilly!
- Mommy!

1729
02:11:33,768 --> 02:11:36,729
- Lilly!
- Help, Daddy!

1730
02:11:38,273 --> 02:11:40,733
Run, Lilly! Run!

1731
02:11:41,276 --> 02:11:44,445
Lilly, run! Go, go!

1732
02:11:45,447 --> 02:11:46,989
Go over, Lilly.

1733
02:11:49,951 --> 02:11:51,577
Caesar. Lilly, take him.

1734
02:11:54,622 --> 02:11:55,873
Mommy!

1735
02:11:57,834 --> 02:11:59,877
Oh, no.

1736
02:12:03,048 --> 02:12:05,799
Sir, is there another way
to the hydraulics chamber?

1737
02:12:05,967 --> 02:12:08,635
- Where does this ladder go?
- To the zoological bay!

1738
02:12:08,803 --> 02:12:10,637
Okay, okay, let's go.

1739
02:12:16,144 --> 02:12:17,186
Professor...

1740
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:19,855
...it's Air Force One.

1741
02:12:37,457 --> 02:12:39,958
- The mid-ship anchor is hit.
- We're destabilizing.

1742
02:12:40,126 --> 02:12:41,418
The bow anchor's giving in.

1743
02:13:01,022 --> 02:13:02,898
Captain,
the turbine's not responding.

1744
02:13:03,066 --> 02:13:05,901
So override it. Hit the override button
and start the engines.

1745
02:13:06,069 --> 02:13:09,196
We can't start the engine
until we close that gate.

1746
02:13:26,798 --> 02:13:28,841
Help me! Help!

1747
02:13:34,014 --> 02:13:37,349
Tamara!

1748
02:13:38,435 --> 02:13:41,145
- You okay?
- My mommy's in there. Help her.

1749
02:13:41,312 --> 02:13:43,772
We'll get to your mommy.
They're doing everything they can.

1750
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:46,400
- Can we talk to them?
- I'm gonna try and connect us.

1751
02:13:46,568 --> 02:13:50,487
- We have to stop the bleeding.
- Mom, how about my belt?

1752
02:13:50,655 --> 02:13:53,032
Mr. Curtis! Jackson!

1753
02:13:53,199 --> 02:13:54,366
Hey!

1754
02:13:54,534 --> 02:13:56,577
Help! Hey!

1755
02:13:56,745 --> 02:13:58,746
it's Adrian Helmsley.
We met at Yellowstone.

1756
02:13:58,913 --> 02:14:01,040
That's great!
Open the goddamn door!

1757
02:14:01,207 --> 02:14:02,499
Your daughter is with me!

1758
02:14:02,667 --> 02:14:05,085
- Lilly!
- Lilly!

1759
02:14:05,253 --> 02:14:08,088
- Where's Noah?
- I'm right here, Lil.

1760
02:14:08,631 --> 02:14:10,174
impact warning.

1761
02:14:10,342 --> 02:14:12,217
Thirty degrees west.

1762
02:14:12,385 --> 02:14:14,136
Forty-five degrees east.

1763
02:14:14,304 --> 02:14:17,806
Target elevation, 29,035 feet.

1764
02:14:17,974 --> 02:14:20,768
Twenty-nine thousand feet?
What the hell is at 29,000 feet?

1765
02:14:20,935 --> 02:14:23,187
We're headed straight
for the north face...

1766
02:14:23,355 --> 02:14:25,522
...of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.

1767
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:30,277
And if we can't start our engines,
we will not survive the impact.

1768
02:14:40,163 --> 02:14:43,082
Jackson, you're sealed off.
We can't get to you!

1769
02:14:43,249 --> 02:14:45,167
There's something blocking
the hydraulics.

1770
02:14:45,335 --> 02:14:48,587
If you can't get it out,
none of us are gonna make it.

1771
02:14:49,089 --> 02:14:51,507
Dr. Helmsley, look at this.

1772
02:14:51,966 --> 02:14:53,676
it is completely submerged
down there.

1773
02:14:53,843 --> 02:14:55,469
There'd be no way to get any air.

1774
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:59,848
- There's no other way.
- But it's a suicide mission, sir.

1775
02:15:06,898 --> 02:15:09,525
I know where it is, I'll give it a try.

1776
02:15:15,949 --> 02:15:18,784
- Dad. Wait, I wanna go with you.
- No, Noah.

1777
02:15:18,952 --> 02:15:21,829
- Dad. I wanna help you.
- No, no. You are helping me, buddy.

1778
02:15:21,996 --> 02:15:23,038
Dad, please.

1779
02:15:23,206 --> 02:15:25,290
Remember when Lilly was born...

1780
02:15:25,458 --> 02:15:27,960
...and you wanted to be introduced
as her big brother?

1781
02:15:28,128 --> 02:15:31,213
Well, she's scared now,
and she needs you more than ever.

1782
02:15:31,381 --> 02:15:32,381
And if you're safe...

1783
02:15:32,549 --> 02:15:34,925
...I know that she's safe.
Do you understand?

1784
02:15:41,433 --> 02:15:43,934
You can help me out the next time.

1785
02:15:44,102 --> 02:15:45,352
Come on.

1786
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:48,272
Kate, we caused this thing,
it was us.

1787
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:51,025
- Gotta go check it out.
- Okay.

1788
02:16:03,413 --> 02:16:04,830
I love you.

1789
02:16:19,304 --> 02:16:22,264
Please! Can you hear me?

1790
02:16:26,436 --> 02:16:31,690
Help!

1791
02:16:54,214 --> 02:16:57,716
Press down.
Press down with your hand.

1792
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:06,975
Don't stop. Keep pressing.

1793
02:17:24,577 --> 02:17:25,619
Noah!

1794
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:34,211
Distance to impact: 1850 meters.

1795
02:17:37,298 --> 02:17:38,465
There he is!

1796
02:17:39,843 --> 02:17:41,510
Captain, we have a visual!

1797
02:17:41,678 --> 02:17:44,847
- I think we found the problem.
- Show us the hydraulic chamber!

1798
02:18:02,198 --> 02:18:04,575
Goddamn it,
I told you to stay up there with Mom.

1799
02:18:04,743 --> 02:18:06,160
I just wanted to help.

1800
02:18:06,327 --> 02:18:07,995
All right, all right.

1801
02:18:08,163 --> 02:18:09,288
You hold the light...

1802
02:18:09,456 --> 02:18:11,957
...but from right here,
right in the air pocket, okay?

1803
02:18:12,459 --> 02:18:14,376
You're a crazy little dude.

1804
02:18:19,049 --> 02:18:20,466
Grandma, Grandpa.

1805
02:18:20,967 --> 02:18:22,593
I'm sorry.

1806
02:18:23,011 --> 02:18:26,889
- I could not save us.
- He has gone back in. He will fix it.

1807
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,517
There's no way.

1808
02:18:31,728 --> 02:18:33,729
Don't lose your faith, brother.

1809
02:19:01,341 --> 02:19:03,008
Dad!

1810
02:19:09,557 --> 02:19:13,143
No, we lost him.
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

1811
02:19:34,374 --> 02:19:36,959
Great job.
You light the way, I'll go for the cable.

1812
02:19:37,127 --> 02:19:38,168
Okay.

1813
02:19:38,336 --> 02:19:41,213
Distance to impact: 400 meters.

1814
02:19:41,381 --> 02:19:44,216
Underwater ridge ahead.
We're going to run aground, captain.

1815
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:03,402
Yeah!

1816
02:20:14,664 --> 02:20:17,249
- Sir, the gate is sealed.
- That's affirmative, captain.

1817
02:20:17,417 --> 02:20:19,293
Anton, start the engine.

1818
02:20:19,461 --> 02:20:21,211
Aye, aye, captain. Full reverse.

1819
02:20:30,138 --> 02:20:34,350
- Too fast! We're not gonna make it.
- Distance to impact: 50 meters.

1820
02:20:35,018 --> 02:20:36,268
Forty meters.

1821
02:20:59,959 --> 02:21:02,086
Reverse motion activated.

1822
02:21:02,253 --> 02:21:05,714
Distance to impact: 10 meters.

1823
02:21:06,341 --> 02:21:07,508
Twenty meters.

1824
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:17,434
Yes!

1825
02:21:22,315 --> 02:21:24,608
- Hard to port.
- Aye, captain. Hard to port.

1826
02:21:35,995 --> 02:21:38,038
We did it. We did it. We did it.

1827
02:21:39,082 --> 02:21:41,417
- Where's your dad?
- He was right behind me.

1828
02:21:42,836 --> 02:21:45,713
Any word from the hydraulic chamber?
Where is he?

1829
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:47,589
I thought you said
he was behind you.

1830
02:21:47,757 --> 02:21:49,299
- He was.
- Are you sure?

1831
02:21:49,467 --> 02:21:51,635
Yeah. He was right there.

1832
02:22:00,228 --> 02:22:03,772
Dad.

1833
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:05,649
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

1834
02:22:10,113 --> 02:22:13,240
Please, God. Please, please.

1835
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:17,286
Please, please, please.

1836
02:22:17,996 --> 02:22:19,621
Come on, Jackson.

1837
02:22:24,336 --> 02:22:25,794
Oh, my...

1838
02:22:34,971 --> 02:22:36,472
- He did it!
- Daddy!

1839
02:22:36,639 --> 02:22:40,225
- He did it!
- He did it.

1840
02:23:36,449 --> 02:23:39,618
"Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day.

1841
02:23:39,786 --> 02:23:42,663
All we can hear is the sound
of our own breathing...

1842
02:23:42,831 --> 02:23:48,502
...that reminds us we are still sharing
our memories, hopes and ideas.

1843
02:23:48,712 --> 02:23:52,339
And isn't it funny, just this morning,
we worked it out:

1844
02:23:52,507 --> 02:23:57,094
Somehow or another,
we all have relatives in Wisconsin.

1845
02:23:59,639 --> 02:24:01,056
The end. "

1846
02:24:11,067 --> 02:24:12,401
it's good.

1847
02:24:13,278 --> 02:24:15,237
I thought you'd like it.

1848
02:24:16,656 --> 02:24:17,865
Tell me, Dr. Wilson...

1849
02:24:18,033 --> 02:24:21,326
...apart from books and art...

1850
02:24:22,495 --> 02:24:28,042
...do you think there's anything else
we might possibly share in the future?

1851
02:24:29,127 --> 02:24:33,130
Are you asking me out on a date,
Dr. Helmsley?

1852
02:24:33,798 --> 02:24:36,425
Because, you know,
my diary is pretty full.

1853
02:24:37,802 --> 02:24:39,345
Actually...

1854
02:24:42,265 --> 02:24:44,099
...yes, I was.

1855
02:24:48,271 --> 02:24:50,773
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please.

1856
02:24:51,232 --> 02:24:52,608
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge.

1857
02:24:55,487 --> 02:24:57,029
Come herw.

1858
02:25:03,119 --> 02:25:06,163
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Michaels speaking.

1859
02:25:06,331 --> 02:25:09,792
in a few minutes I will give orders
to unseal the decks.

1860
02:25:09,959 --> 02:25:13,087
- Come on.
- At 2345 last night...

1861
02:25:13,254 --> 02:25:17,424
...our sister arks, Numbers 6 and 7,
have joined our course.

1862
02:25:18,927 --> 02:25:20,636
For the first time on ourjourney...

1863
02:25:20,804 --> 02:25:23,806
...we'll have clear skies
and moderate-to-good air quality.

1864
02:25:23,973 --> 02:25:27,267
As you know, our passenger count
is way over capacity.

1865
02:25:27,435 --> 02:25:29,895
So please be careful
when you step out.

1866
02:25:30,063 --> 02:25:33,816
And of course, enjoy the fresh air.

1867
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:36,985
Can I hold him?

1868
02:25:37,696 --> 02:25:40,322
Sure. He can be your dog too,
if you like.

1869
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:41,657
Thanks.

1870
02:25:45,745 --> 02:25:49,123
- Where have you been all my life?
- Gift shop.

1871
02:26:45,972 --> 02:26:48,390
Oh, Adrian, excellent.

1872
02:26:48,808 --> 02:26:51,560
I called because we just got
our first satellite feed.

1873
02:26:51,728 --> 02:26:54,229
The equalization
of the oceanic seabeds...

1874
02:26:54,397 --> 02:26:56,899
...has not turned out
to be as extreme as we expected.

1875
02:26:57,067 --> 02:27:00,736
The waters are receding much faster
than we thought, thank God.

1876
02:27:00,904 --> 02:27:02,696
And this is hard to believe...

1877
02:27:02,864 --> 02:27:05,908
...but the Himalayas
are no longer the roof of the world.

1878
02:27:06,076 --> 02:27:09,328
it's now the Drakensberg mountains
of KwaZulu-Natal.

1879
02:27:09,496 --> 02:27:11,580
The entire African continent
has risen.

1880
02:27:11,748 --> 02:27:14,708
Several thousand feet,
and it likely never even flooded.

1881
02:27:14,876 --> 02:27:17,252
That's why they call it
the Cape of Good Hope.

1882
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:19,213
We've already set course for it.

1883
02:27:26,388 --> 02:27:28,305
Daddy,
when will we go back home?

1884
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:30,432
Well, we talked about that.

1885
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:34,269
We're gonna find a new home
out here somewhere, right?

1886
02:27:34,437 --> 02:27:37,189
I mean, wherever we're all together,
that's home.

1887
02:27:37,357 --> 02:27:39,650
Right? Don't be scared.

1888
02:27:39,818 --> 02:27:41,443
I'm not.

1889
02:27:43,238 --> 02:27:44,780
No more Pull-Ups.

1890
02:27:48,118 --> 02:27:49,576
Nice.
