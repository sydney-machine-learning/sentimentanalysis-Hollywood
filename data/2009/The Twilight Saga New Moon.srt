1
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,769
"These violent delights
have violent ends,

2
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,315
"and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

3
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,903
"which, as they kiss, consume."

4
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,356
Gran?

5
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,375
Edward, don't! She'll see you.

6
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,382
Hmm.

7
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,262
Okay.

8
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,817
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

9
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,181
Happy birthday, Bella.

10
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,612
Happy birthday.

11
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,994
I thought we agreed, no presents.

12
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,622
Well, the one from me's not wrapped,
so it doesn't count.

13
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,129
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

14
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,383
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

15
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,719
Well, she coordinated me.

16
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:45,057
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

17
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,769
Senior year.

18
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,357
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-l didn't. It's not that old.

19
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,235
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

20
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,321
No. No way.

21
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,035
Happy birthday.

22
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,536
That's really funny.

23
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,999
Another missing
hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.

24
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,792
Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...

25
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,048
Situation's a!! critica!

26
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,968
You've got to look first before you go

27
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,970
It's Bella. Bella!

28
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,889
-Hi.
- I'm...

29
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,185
Today's the big day, Bella.

30
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,854
A and J essay due.

31
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,316
-Oh, yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?

32
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,442
)

33
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,321
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like,

34
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,530
a scrapbook full of memories.

35
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,615
Oh.
Cool. Yeah.

36
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,033
I take them. I'm not in them.

37
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,493
-No, no, no, come here.
- Well, you are today.

38
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,953
You'll photoshop this
if my nose looks big, right?

39
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,831
Don't worry, I’m in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

40
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,333
That's good.

41
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,086
Oh, good. Cullen's here.

42
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,132
Well, talk to you later.

43
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,824
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.

44
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,908
Mmm.

45
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,162
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

46
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,957
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?

47
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,087
I think 18 is a little young
to start worrying about that.

48
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,797
Its one year older than you.

49
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,425
No, it isn't. I’m 109.

50
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,845
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating
such an old man.

51
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,473
-Mmm.
-It’s gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

52
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,558
Uh-huh.

53
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,738
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.

54
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,036
Wait a second.

55
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,705
Someone wants you.

56
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,291
- Bella!
-Jacob!

57
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,084
What?

58
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,921
I'll leave you to talk.

59
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,888
Hello, biceps! You know,
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

60
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,349
Well, I’m just filling out, Bella.

61
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,853
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

62
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,231
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

63
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,777
I’m all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

64
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,863
They let any old riffraff into this place.

65
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,032
-I see. Then why are you slumming it?
-Mmm-hmm.

66
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,576
l was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

67
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,204
You should really come
take a ride when it's done.

68
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,663
Is it fast?

69
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,790
Um.

70
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,666
It’s decent.

71
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,128
-I’m kidding.
-Okay. Good.

72
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,964
Hey, happy birthday.

73
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,676
Your dad told my dad, so...

74
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,304
Yeah, of course he did.

75
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,432
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

76
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,811
Catches bad dreams.

77
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,856
That's kind of perfect.

78
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,401
Thank you.

79
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,403
No problem.

80
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,782
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I’ll see you later.

81
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,991
Bye.

82
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,163
So how come Jacob Black
gets to give you a gift and I don't?

83
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,209
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

84
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,712
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

85
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,299
See? Thank you.

86
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,969
-That's all l want.
- Bella!

87
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,847
-Happy birthday!
-Shh, shh!

88
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,643
I thought I said no presents.

89
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,854
I've already seen you open it,
and guess what,

90
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,355
you love it.

91
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,233
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

92
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,988
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

93
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,994
-Okay. All right.
-Great!

94
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,204
Okay, I’ll see you at 7:00.

95
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,209
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

96
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,294
)

97
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,380
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

98
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,091
Never mind.

99
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,638
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

100
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,683
O my love! My wife!

101
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,644
Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath

102
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,147
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

103
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,192
Thou art not conquered.

104
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,572
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

105
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,242
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

106
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,286
I hate being celebrated.

107
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,915
There are worse tragedies.
l mean, look at Romeo.

108
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,959
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

109
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,962
Yeah.

110
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,632
Though l do envy him one thing.

111
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,552
Juliet is, like, perfect.

112
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,889
lf you like
that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

113
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,145
Not the girl, the suicide.

114
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,318
It’s nearly impossible for...

115
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,405
For some people.

116
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,328
For humans, a little poison,

117
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,415
a dagger to the heart.

118
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,294
There's so many different options.

119
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,466
Why would you say that?

120
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,262
Because I had to consider it once.

121
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,516
I didn't know if I’d get to you in time.

122
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,311
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

123
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,273
What was the plan?

124
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,818
That I’d go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

125
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,862
-The what?
-The Volturi.

126
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,408
.  Now, who'd like to repeat
the last few lines of iambic pentameter

127
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,035
just to show they were paying attention?

128
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,870
Mr. Cullen?

129
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,542
Yes, Mr. Berty.

130
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,132
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

131
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,305
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

132
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,016
"Eyes, look your last.

133
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,893
"Arms, take your last embrace!

134
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,731
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

135
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,736
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless
bargain to engrossing death!"

136
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,073
Eyes on the screen, people.

137
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,077
Thus with a kiss I die.

138
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,667
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

139
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,921
l guess they're the closest thing
to royalty my world has.

140
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,716
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.

141
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,094
He lived with them for a few decades.

142
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,766
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course,

143
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,145
but a respect for the arts and the sciences,
at least.

144
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,231
And the law.

145
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,984
Above all, the law.

146
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,989
Vampires have laws?

147
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,159
Not very many.

148
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,163
And only one that's regularly enforced.

149
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,125
What is it?

150
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,296
That we keep the existence
of our kind a secret.

151
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,800
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

152
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,221
and we don't kill conspicuously.

153
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,602
Unless, of course, you want to die.

154
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,077
You gotta stop talking about that.

155
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,956
I can't even think
about someone hurting you.

156
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,629
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me
is you.

157
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,467
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

158
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,635
That's not true.

159
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,849
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

160
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,271
Alice will see when she decides,
and we'll be ready.

161
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,440
I could protect you

162
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,192
if you change me.

163
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,279
Bella, you already do protect me.

164
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,241
You're my only reason

165
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,661
to stay alive,

166
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,164
if that's what I am.

167
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,793
But it's my job to protect you.

168
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,467
From everyone except my sister.

169
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,761
It’s time! It’s time. It’s time. It’s time!

170
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,267
Your lips are nettles

171
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,394
Your tongue is wine

172
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,481
You're left as liquid
But your body's pine

173
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,232
.  Sorry about all this.

174
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,152
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.

175
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,738
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.

176
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,660
I found it in your bag. You mind?

177
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,663
Dating an older woman. Hot.

178
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,084
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.

179
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,049
It’s a necklace. Alice picked it out.

180
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,675
Thanks.

181
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,096
Show me the love.

182
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,810
This one's from Emmett.

183
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,774
Already installed it in your truck.

184
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,275
Finally a decent sound system

185
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,736
-for that piece of...
-Hey! Don't hate the truck.

186
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,862
)

187
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,114
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

188
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,868
.  Just a little something
to brighten your day.

189
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,955
Yes, you've been looking
kind of pale lately.

190
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,211
Ow.

191
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,297
Paper cut.

192
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,117
Jaz, Jaz. It’s okay. It’s just a little

193
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,829
blood.

194
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,254
.  Get Jasper out of here.

195
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,304
I’m sorry, I can't.

196
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,392
I’ll have to stitch this up in my office.

197
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,313
Check on Jasper.

198
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,565
I’m sure he's very upset with himself,

199
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,110
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

200
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,403
Edward.

201
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,376
l never wanted to have a party.
.  It’s not your fault.

202
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:07,549
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

203
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,926
How do you do it?

204
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,055
Years and years of practice.

205
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,434
Did you ever think
of just doing it the easy way?

206
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,354
No.

207
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,941
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

208
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,446
It brings me happiness,
even if l am damned regardless.

209
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,283
Damned?

210
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,995
Like hell?

211
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,879
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

212
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,548
You couldn't. It’s impossible.

213
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,676
Thank you, Bella.

214
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,888
You've always been very gracious about us.

215
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,229
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

216
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,693
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

217
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,197
If you believed as Edward does,

218
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,784
could you take away his soul?

219
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,851
You can't protect me

220
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,646
from everything.

221
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,066
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

222
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,404
It’s gonna be an accident or illness

223
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,990
or old age,

224
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:01,121
as long as I’m human.
And the only solution is to change me.

225
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,334
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

226
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,046
You're not gonna want me
when I look like a grandmother.

227
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,560
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you at all?

228
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,064
Carlisle told me

229
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,320
how you feel about your soul.

230
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,698
I don't believe that.

231
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,035
So don't worry about mine.

232
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,996
You should go inside.

233
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,638
It’s still my birthday.

234
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,268
So can I ask one thing?

235
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,065
Kiss me?

236
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:46,893
I love you.

237
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,008
Up with your turret

238
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:24,264
Aren't we just terrified?

239
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,446
Shale, screen your worry

240
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,492
From what you won't ever find

241
00:20:53,878 --> 00:21:02,177
Don't let it fool you

242
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,888
Down

243
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,018
Hey.

244
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,358
Just come take a walk with me.

245
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,050
We have to leave Forks.

246
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,554
Why?

247
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,645
Carlisle's supposed to be 1 0 years older
than he looks,

248
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,106
and people are starting to notice.

249
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,779
Okay, I’ve gotta think of something to say
to Charlie.

250
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,459
When you say "we"...

251
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,966
I mean my family and myself.

252
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,724
Edward, what happened with Jasper,
it's nothing.

253
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,768
You're right. It was nothing,

254
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,898
nothing but what l always expected

255
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,112
and nothing compared
to what could have happened.

256
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,954
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

257
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,711
I belong with you.

258
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,798
No. You don't.

259
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,761
I’m coming.

260
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,971
Bella,

261
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,725
I don't want you to come.

262
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,026
You don't want me?

263
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:29,908
No.

264
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,998
That changes things a lot.

265
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,960
But if it's not too much to ask,

266
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,173
can you just promise me something?

267
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,761
Don't do anything reckless.

268
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,307
For Charlie's sake.

269
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,686
And I’ll promise something to you in return.

270
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,606
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

271
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,817
I won't come back,

272
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:08,196
and you can go on with your life
without any interference from me.

273
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,784
It will be like l never existed, I promise.

274
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,958
lf this is about my soul, take it.
l don't want it without you.

275
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,085
It’s not about your soul.

276
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,549
You're just not good for me.

277
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,094
Not good enough for you.

278
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,973
I’m just sorry l let this go on for so long.

279
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,184
Please...

280
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,020
Don't...

281
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,652
Goodbye.

282
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:24,105
Edward.

283
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,443
Edward!

284
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,619
Edward.

285
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,945
I’m gonna try the Cullens' place again.

286
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,741
- The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.

287
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,534
Where'd they go?

288
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,412
We'll find her, Charlie.

289
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,831
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!

290
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,207
Hey.

291
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,087
She's all right.

292
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,425
I got her. Thank you, Sam.

293
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:52,188
There's a possibility

294
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,653
All that I had

295
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,323
Was all I’m gonna get

296
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,665
Alice, you've disappeared,

297
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,253
like everything else.

298
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,215
Now who else can I talk to? I’m lost.

299
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,932
When you left,

300
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,519
and he left,

301
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,107
you took everything with you.

302
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,237
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.

303
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,123
It’s like a huge hole has been punched
through my chest.

304
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,880
Bella.

305
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,023
But in a way I’m glad.

306
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,651
The pain is my only reminder
that he was real,

307
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,403
that you all were.

308
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,331
All right. That's it.

309
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,210
What?

310
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,922
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

311
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,218
I’m not leaving Forks.

312
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,389
Bells, he's not coming back.

313
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,727
I know.

314
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,773
It’s just not normal, this behavior.

315
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:03,277
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell out of me
and your mother.

316
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,281
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

317
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:12,370
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

318
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,121
I like my old friends.

319
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,958
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.

320
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:24,715
I’m gonna go shopping tomorrow
with Jessica.

321
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,719
-You hate shopping.
-I...

322
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,598
I need a girls' night out.

323
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,229
All right. Girls' night.

324
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,982
Shopping.

325
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,486
I like it. Go buy some stuff.

326
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,830
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

327
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,958
Yeah, Bella Swan.

328
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,423
I don't know why you want to
sit through

329
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,759
all those zombies eating people
and no hot guys kissing anybody.

330
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,388
It’s gross. Like... And why are there
that many zombie movies anyway?

331
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,057
'Cause if it's supposed to, like,
draw a parallel about leprosy,

332
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,102
my cousin had leprosy.
It’s not funny, you know?

333
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,105
And, like, is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

334
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,357
Because don't be so pleased
with your own, like,

335
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,068
self-referential cleverness, you know?

336
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,614
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

337
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,700
Although I was surprised
you even called at all. You know?

338
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,911
Like, your depression thing,
I get it. I’m totally, totally worried.

339
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:36,996
But after a while it's like,

340
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,581
-you're still bumming...
- You want a ride, girls?

341
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,625
...and I’m going through stuff, too.
You know? Like Mike deciding

342
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,792
he just wants to be friends.

343
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,835
What's up? Look what we found.

344
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,128
It’s hard, you know?

345
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,504
Like, and since when does "just friends"...

346
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,131
1 : What's up guys?
2: Look what we found.

347
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,258
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going?

348
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,309
Keep walking.

349
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,104
This is dangerous.

350
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,241
-Dude, come on.
- Come here for a sec!

351
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,414
I think I know those guys.

352
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,334
We got beer! We got bikes!

353
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,504
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

354
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,757
I’m just gonna see something.

355
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,259
Hey, girlie!

356
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,392
All right, all right. We got a taker.

357
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,519
Turn around.

358
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,577
2: Shut up!
3: You shut up!

359
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,085
I’m sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

360
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,004
No, that's cool.
I’ll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

361
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,757
So, what do you say?

362
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,889
You promised me, nothing reckless.

363
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:26,063
You promised it would be
as if you never existed.

364
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,321
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?

365
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,906
You know what? Never mind.

366
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,676
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

367
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,606
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

368
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,357
Just curious.

369
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,779
-l thought that l saw something.
-You... Oh.

370
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,491
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

371
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,577
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

372
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,040
I was about to end up in an
interview room like some lame  show.

373
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,375
God, that was such a rush.

374
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,630
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?

375
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,964
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

376
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,301
You don't get on the back
of some random loser's motorcycle.

377
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,552
Crazy.

378
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,726
Alice, I saw him.

379
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,648
Maybe I’m crazy now. I guess that's okay.

380
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,028
If a rush of danger
is what it takes to see him,

381
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,364
then that's what I’ll find.

382
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,619
Bella!

383
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,789
Where the hell have you been, loca?

384
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,295
I brought you something.

385
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,590
-Okay.
-It’s a little crazy.

386
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,721
Wow.

387
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,307
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

388
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,601
I saved it from the junkyard.

389
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:33,732
I think they'll probably cost more to fix
than they're worth,

390
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,235
but then I thought that
if l had a mechanic friend

391
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,570
-to help me out then...
-Ah!

392
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,031
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.

393
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,244
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.

394
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,503
I get it if you think that
this is really stupid and reckless.

395
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,631
Yeah, I mean,
it's completely stupid and reckless.

396
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,261
When do we start?

397
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,514
Um.

398
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,641
Now.

399
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,311
-Please?
- All right.

400
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:17,109
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...

401
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,700
Jake, you're, like, buff.

402
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,036
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

403
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,456
Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?

404
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,087
It feels like that sometimes.

405
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,017
That song's good. You don't like it?

406
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:55,522
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

407
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,692
Okay. No more music.

408
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,948
So I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this every day,

409
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,866
and hopefully we will,

410
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,661
we have to, like,
fit some homework in there somewhere.

411
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,789
I don't want Billy thinking that
I’m a bad influence on you.

412
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,000
You? Influence me? Please.

413
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,880
Are you... I’m older than you,

414
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,300
so that makes me the influencer
and you the influence.

415
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,969
No, no, no.

416
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,806
My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you

417
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,392
because of your general paleness
and lack of know-how.

418
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,978
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

419
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,606
Don't you think that makes you
kind of young and naive?

420
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,900
Okay. So where do we stand?

421
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,862
-I’m 35. And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.

422
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,659
- Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It’s okay. It’s just my boys.

423
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,495
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

424
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,123
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.

425
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,583
I’m Quil Ateara.

426
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,587
So the bike building story is true.

427
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,756
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I taught him everything he knows.

428
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,634
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

429
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,261
Uh...

430
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,179
We're friends, you know.

431
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,889
- Burn.
-Actually,

432
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,851
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

433
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,811
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

434
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,854
Nope.

435
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,440
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.

436
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,236
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

437
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,030
Yeah, that's still a riot.

438
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,074
You want funny, Black? I’ll give you funny.

439
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,702
Jeez.

440
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,120
Hey, that hold's illegal!

441
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,205
I got five bucks on Quil.

442
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,915
You're on.

443
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,422
All of the astronauts
Champagne in plastic cups

444
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,801
Waiting for the big hero to show

445
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:52,973
Outside the door he stands
His head in his hands

446
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,226
And his heart in his throat

447
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,354
What can he tell them now

448
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:00,939
Dear Alice,

449
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,400
I wish I had your real address.

450
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,403
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

451
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,864
He makes me feel better.

452
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,493
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

453
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,164
The hole in my chest,

454
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:22,294
well, when I’m with Jake,
it's like it's almost healed

455
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,755
for a while.

456
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:29,343
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.

457
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,844
Oh.

458
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:35,516
Well, I’m really not into
the whole cougar thing. You know?

459
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
What's up with you and age?

460
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,148
I mean,
how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

461
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,612
But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.

462
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,997
Hey, hey, hey!

463
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,874
Wake up, Bella.

464
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,627
You're okay. You're okay.

465
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:19,143
I thought this thing was starting to work,
but I guess not.

466
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,568
Can I ask you something?

467
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,488
Hanging out with Jacob,

468
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:36,118
that seems to take your mind
off things a bit, doesn't it?

469
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,916
You know, sometimes

470
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,963
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

471
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,716
You know what I mean?

472
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,262
Of course, what do I know?

473
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,931
I’m just a terminal bachelor.

474
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,227
Famous ladies' man.

475
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,898
Okay.

476
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,401
I’m gonna go to bed.

477
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,111
Uh...

478
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,030
I love you.

479
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:23,707
lf l told you l couldn't have fixed
these bikes, what would you have said?

480
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,545
Are you doubting your mad skills?

481
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:32,591
No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.

482
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,968
It’s just,

483
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,682
maybe if I was smart,
I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

484
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:49,816
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,

485
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,779
but that we're just gonna
have to find something else to do.

486
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,661
Is that Sam Uley?

487
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,039
Yeah. Him and his cult.

488
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,377
Oh, my God.

489
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,173
Did you see that?

490
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,766
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

491
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,352
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

492
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,441
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.

493
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,861
We leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

494
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:40,367
You have some kind of beef with him
or something?

495
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,036
l don't know.

496
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,706
They just think they run this place.

497
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,001
Embry used to call them
hall monitors on steroids.

498
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,545
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?

499
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,716
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?

500
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,759
He missed some school.

501
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:01,930
Now all of a sudden, he started
following Sam around like a little puppy.

502
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,850
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

503
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,602
Sam keeps giving me this look,

504
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,399
like he's waiting for me or something.

505
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,403
It’s kind of starting to freak me out.

506
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,905
Well, you should just avoid him.

507
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,242
I try.

508
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,719
Okay.

509
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,932
-You look scared.
-I’m not.

510
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,685
All right.

511
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,771
-Brake?
-That one.

512
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,484
Clutch?

513
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,777
Good.

514
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,236
Gas?

515
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,990
Ready?

516
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,203
Now, slowly release the clutch.

517
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,414
Bella.

518
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Stop.

519
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,838
Whoa!

520
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,884
You all right?

521
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,970
I’m gonna go again.

522
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,555
Okay.

523
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,153
Ah!

524
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:42,614
Whoa!

525
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,826
Hit the brake!

526
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,425
I wanna go again.

527
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,260
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

528
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,887
-No. l want to go again.
-No. Forget it.

529
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,348
No more bikes.

530
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,851
Man, your head.

531
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,477
Ow.

532
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,148
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, I’m sorry.

533
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,026
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

534
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,989
Yeah. I guess I am.

535
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,742
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

536
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,291
There.

537
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,924
What are you staring at?

538
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,430
You're sort of beautiful.

539
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,648
How hard did you hit your head?

540
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,151
I don't know.

541
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,905
Let's go.

542
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,826
I did see something in the woods.

543
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,745
Totally. Baby, l believe you.

544
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,122
No, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.

545
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,544
No, okay. It was jet black and huge.

546
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,464
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.

547
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,715
A bear, maybe?

548
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,259
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.

549
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,679
Well, I saw it.

550
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,432
You know, you're not the only one.

551
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,894
My dad's been getting reports at the station.

552
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,897
Like, five hikers have been killed
by some bear.

553
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,107
But they can't find the bear.

554
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,192
Hmm.

555
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,155
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

556
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:48,865
Um...

557
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,744
So? I mean,

558
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,205
Bella's back?

559
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,585
Yeah, I guess so.

560
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,255
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

561
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,342
So, listen, now that you're talking

562
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:13,515
and eating again, which, you know,
you've got to get that protein in there,

563
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:19,854
I was just wondering if you wanted to go
see a movie with me.

564
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,528
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, l do.

565
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,656
Cool.

566
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,242
Let me see, we could check out

567
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,078
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

568
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,248
You know, it's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy.

569
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,167
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No. No romance.

570
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,341
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?

571
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,595
I mean, that's an action movie.

572
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,513
Yeah, that's perfect.

573
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,182
Guns, adrenaline.

574
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,268
That's my thing.

575
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,519
Okay.

576
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:04,190
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?

577
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,483
Face Punch, yeah!

578
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,068
Mike, hey,
we were supposed to watch that.

579
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,695
Remember, the trailer's like...

580
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,989
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.

581
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,783
Yeah!
Movie night with Bella.

582
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,872
So Face Punch, huh?

583
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,541
You like action movies?

584
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,960
Not really.

585
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,716
I heard it sucks. Bad.

586
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,095
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

587
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,806
I mean, you know, without,
like, adult supervision.

588
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,808
Right, yeah, well,
she's buying my ticket for me.

589
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,852
She's buying it. Okay.

590
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,898
Jessica bailed,
and Angela got the stomach flu,

591
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,233
so Eric's taking care of her.

592
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,403
-It’s just us three.
-Great!

593
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,031
-Great.
-Yeah.

594
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,494
1   Put your gun down.

595
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,288
2   Put your gun down
or I’m gonna blow your frickin' head off.

596
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,832
3   Both of you put both
of your guns down

597
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,627
or I’m gonna blow both
of your frickin' heads off.

598
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,505
1   All right, forget it,
let's do this!

599
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,442
Okay, I think I’m gonna throw up.

600
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,950
He's...

601
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,119
What a marshmallow!

602
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,707
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

603
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,252
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

604
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,170
Yeah. I’ll keep my eye open for that.

605
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,802
I feel bad. He probably has
that flu that's going around.

606
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,474
What? I can't hold your hand?

607
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,601
No, of course you can.

608
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:10,483
I just think it means, you know,
something a little different to you. So...

609
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:16,072
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?

610
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,580
And you think I’m sort of beautiful?

611
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:28,293
Jacob, please, don't do this.

612
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,176
Why?

613
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,390
Because you're about to ruin everything.

614
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,853
And I need you.

615
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,237
Well, I’ve got loads of time.

616
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,282
I’m not gonna give up.

617
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,036
I don't want you to,

618
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,500
but it's just 'cause I don't want you
to go anywhere.

619
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,296
And that's really selfish.

620
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:20,053
You know,
I’m not like a car that you can fix up.

621
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:28,228
I’m never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

622
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,899
It’s because of him, right?

623
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,410
Look,

624
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,498
I know what he did to you.

625
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:54,087
But, Bella, l would never ever do that.

626
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,009
I won't ever hurt you. l promise.

627
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,429
I won't let you down.

628
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,266
You can count on me.

629
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,108
Well,

630
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,282
I need to go home.

631
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:32,292
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?

632
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,838
What is your problem?

633
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,173
Right now? You're my problem.

634
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:43,177
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

635
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,139
You want me to put you in the hospital?

636
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,559
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

637
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,604
You're really hot.

638
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,442
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

639
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,737
I don't know what's happening.

640
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,198
I gotta go.

641
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,997
That dude is weird.

642
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,170
Jake,
your dad says you have mono.

643
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,924
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

644
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,098
Hey, it's me again. I just...

645
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,061
I’m sorry about what I said
at the movie theater.

646
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,357
I just wanted to hear your voice,
so no pressure.

647
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:41,903
Jacob, please...

648
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,239
Call me.

649
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,951
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.

650
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,167
Hey.

651
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,087
Look, l don't have to go fishing today.

652
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,588
Yes, you do.

653
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,591
Yeah, you do.
Go. What are you talking about?

654
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,343
Just be careful.

655
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,886
Always am.

656
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,057
Those bears won't get the drop on me,
Bella.

657
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,142
My kung fu is strong.

658
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,552
Jake!

659
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,804
Hey!

660
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,602
You cut your hair off?

661
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,274
And got a tattoo?

662
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,820
Bella.

663
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,865
l thought you were too sick to come outside

664
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,493
or pick up the phone when l call.

665
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,079
Go away.

666
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:17,582
What?

667
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,585
Go away.

668
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,714
What happened to you? What's...

669
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,091
Hey! What happened?

670
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33,097
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

671
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,476
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

672
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,063
But if you want somebody to blame,

673
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,150
how about those filthy bloodsuckers
you love, the Cullens?

674
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,492
l don't know what you're talking about.

675
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,286
No, you know exactly
what I’m talking about.

676
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,164
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

677
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,502
But you can't lie to me.

678
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,755
-Not anymore, Bella.
- Jacob!

679
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,757
Jacob!

680
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,306
Look, Bella,

681
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,851
we can't be friends anymore.

682
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:23,523
Look, Jake,
l know that I’ve been hurting you.

683
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,194
It’s killing me. It kills me.

684
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,282
l just need... Maybe give me, like,

685
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,368
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.

686
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,870
It’s not you.

687
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,668
It’s not you, it's me, right? Really?

688
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,921
It’s true. It is me.

689
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,009
I’m not good.

690
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:58,015
l used to be a good kid.

691
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,726
Not anymore.

692
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,522
This doesn't even matter. All right?

693
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,815
This is over.

694
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,067
You can't break up with me.

695
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,237
l mean...

696
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,907
l mean, you're my best friend.

697
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,162
You promised me.

698
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,956
l know.

699
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,543
l promised l wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

700
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,921
And this is me keeping that promise.

701
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,048
Go home

702
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,219
and don't come back
or you're gonna get hurt.

703
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,067
Alice,

704
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,612
things are...

705
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,115
Things are bad again.

706
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:00,453
Without Jake, l just... l can't stand it.

707
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,083
l don't see Edward anymore.

708
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,463
Will it really feel like he never existed?

709
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,140
l will find the place
where l can see him again.

710
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:17,613
Bella.

711
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:19,907
Laurent.

712
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,412
l didn't expect to find you here.

713
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,876
l went to visit the Cullens,
but the house is empty.

714
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,715
I’m surprised they left you behind.

715
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,925
Weren't you sort of

716
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,678
a pet of theirs?

717
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,180
Yeah. You could say that.

718
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,599
Do the Cullens visit often?

719
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:51,814
Lie.

720
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,696
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

721
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,323
Lie better.

722
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:03,034
I’ll tell them that you stopped by.

723
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,828
But l probably shouldn't

724
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,956
tell Edward,

725
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,126
'cause he's pretty protective.

726
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,420
But he's far away, isn't he?

727
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,050
Why are you here?

728
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:23,512
I came as a favor to Victoria.

729
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,517
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see

730
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:32,188
if you were still under
the protection of the Cullens.

731
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:35,691
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate,

732
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,902
given he killed hers.

733
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,779
An eye for an eye.

734
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,614
Threaten him.

735
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,201
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

736
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,162
l don't think he will.

737
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,333
After all, how much could you mean to him

738
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,294
if he left you here unprotected?

739
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,633
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you,

740
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,718
but l can't help myself.

741
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,762
You are so mouth-watering.

742
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,557
-Please, don't. l mean, you helped us.
-No, no, no, no.

743
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,020
Don't be afraid. I’m doing you a kindness.

744
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,981
Victoria plans on killing you
slowly,

745
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,609
painfully,

746
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,821
whereas I’ll make it quick.

747
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,531
l promise.

748
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:26,534
You will feel nothing.

749
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,916
Edward, l love you.

750
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,962
l don't believe it.

751
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,573
-Dad! l saw them.
-What's the matter?

752
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,659
-In the woods. They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?

753
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,495
Bell, what the hell
were you doing out in the woods?

754
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,290
They're wolves.
l mean, they're like huge wolves.

755
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,209
Are you sure about that, Bella?

756
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:01,504
Yeah! l just saw them.
They were after something.

757
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:03,923
Wolves?

758
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,592
You saw them?

759
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:11,764
All right, well, Harry,

760
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:16,393
feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

761
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,896
Sure, yeah, I’ll just...

762
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,483
By now, those wolves will be dead,

763
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,154
and Laurent would have told her
I’m unprotected.

764
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,489
Victoria.

765
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,700
l should go to the station.

766
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,245
Yeah, you should. You should go.

767
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,248
Can you just stay in the house?

768
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:03,524
Bella!

769
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,611
You scared me.

770
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:11,156
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up. I’m coming up.

771
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,628
Hey.

772
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:28,507
Look, I’m sorry.

773
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,850
-For what?
-l wish l could explain.

774
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,061
But l literally can't.

775
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:53,198
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone,

776
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,577
one that wasn't yours to share?

777
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,041
Well, that's what it's like for me.

778
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,626
But worse.

779
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:08,380
You have no idea how tight I’m bound.

780
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,008
l hate this.

781
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,927
l hate what they've done to you.

782
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,487
l mean, the killer part is, you already know.

783
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:40,287
Bella, do you remember
when we walked on the beach at La Push?

784
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,123
The...

785
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,797
The story. The story about

786
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,758
the cold ones.

787
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:58,222
l guess l understand
why that's the only part you remember.

788
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:09,066
There's gotta be something that you can do.

789
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,193
No. I’m in it for life.

790
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,239
Well, maybe we should just
get out of here for a while.

791
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,199
Just leave,

792
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,909
just you and me.

793
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:20,953
You'd do that?

794
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,041
l would do it for you.

795
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,676
It’s not something
l can just run away from, Bella.

796
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:40,139
But l would run away with you

797
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,811
if l could.

798
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,152
l gotta go.
They'll start wondering where l am.

799
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,824
Come here.

800
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,371
Please,

801
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,207
try to remember.

802
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,961
It'd be so much easier

803
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:13,797
if you knew.

804
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,802
I’ll try. But, Jake...

805
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,347
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

806
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,647
Jake.

807
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,291
Edward, I’m scared.

808
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,502
You should be.

809
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,467
Really, it's just like an old story.

810
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,427
I’m not really supposed
to say anything about it.

811
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:04,306
Did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?

812
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,405
Bella?

813
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,574
l need to see him.

814
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,827
He's not in.

815
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,790
-Okay, I’m sorry, l really need to see him.
-Bella!

816
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,432
What did you do?

817
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,476
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.

818
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:50,936
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!

819
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,062
He didn't want this.

820
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,523
What did we do? What did he do?
What'd he tell you?

821
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,024
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.

822
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:59,194
He tells me nothing
because he's scared of you.

823
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,243
-Too late now.
- Bella, get back!

824
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,163
Paul, calm down, now!

825
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,048
Bella!

826
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,426
Run!

827
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:26,972
Jake, run!

828
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,333
Paul!

829
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,679
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

830
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,767
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

831
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:20,651
Alice, is it possible that everything
is true?

832
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,737
The fairy tales and horror stories?

833
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:27,366
Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane or normal at all?

834
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,453
Hey, l think we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

835
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,164
l hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

836
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,041
No way. Jacob's a natural.

837
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,836
You see him phase on the fly?
l got five says Paul doesn't touch him.

838
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,381
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

839
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,466
Speak for yourself.

840
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:47,636
l done me wrong

841
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,930
And done all wrong

842
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,142
All the wrong I’ve done
I’m sure I’ll live quite long

843
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:58,814
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

844
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,151
Why would l stare?

845
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,321
Are you guys hungry? Like l have to ask.

846
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,330
Who's this?

847
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,249
Bella Swan. Who else?

848
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:19,960
Hmm.

849
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,295
So, you're the vampire girl.

850
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,426
So, you're the wolf girl.

851
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,680
Guess so.

852
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,349
Well, I’m engaged to one.

853
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:42,232
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

854
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,735
Sure. Thanks.

855
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:48,321
Leave it to Jacob to find a way
around Sam's gag order.

856
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,033
He didn't say anything to me.

857
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,284
That's a wolf thing.

858
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,870
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want them to or not.

859
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,205
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.

860
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,126
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it!

861
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,795
This chick runs with vampires.

862
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,382
You can't really run with vampires.

863
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,219
'Cause they're fast.

864
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:14,222
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

865
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,309
Freaked out yet?

866
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,396
You're not the first monsters I’ve met.

867
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,316
Jake's right. You're good with weird.

868
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,277
Hey.

869
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,006
Sorry.

870
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,356
So you're a werewolf?

871
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,527
Yeah. Last time l checked.

872
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,865
A few lucky members
of the tribe have the gene.

873
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,036
A bloodsucker moves into town
and the fever sets in.

874
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,706
Mono.

875
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,001
Yeah. l wish.

876
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:32,342
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

877
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,888
l mean, it's wrong.

878
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,018
It’s not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

879
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,147
l was born this way. l can't help it.

880
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:48,400
You're such a hypocrite. What,
I’m not the right kind of monster for you?

881
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,402
It’s not what you are.

882
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,197
It’s what you do. They never hurt anybody.

883
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,034
You've killed people, Jake.

884
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,537
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

885
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:03,999
Then who is?

886
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:07,043
What we're trying
to protect you people from,

887
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:09,421
the only thing we do kill,

888
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,091
vampires.

889
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:15,677
Wait, Jake, you can't.

890
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,013
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens

891
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,557
unless they violate the treaty.

892
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,268
That's not what I’m saying.

893
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,104
You can't kill vampires. They'll...

894
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:28,273
They'll kill you.

895
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:31,860
Really? We took out that leech
with the dreads easy enough.

896
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:37,407
Laurent?

897
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,160
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

898
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,995
Victoria's here?

899
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,081
Was. We chased her all the way
to the Canadian border the other night.

900
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,585
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

901
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,003
l do.

902
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,507
Me.

903
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:06,478
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

904
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,606
She won't get near you or Charlie.

905
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,900
Look, you've got to be careful.

906
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:15,070
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

907
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:19,032
You know, your lack of confidence in us
is a little insulting.

908
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,410
All right, I’d better go.

909
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,330
You gotta go?

910
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:27,415
Yeah.

911
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,293
Got a vampire to kill.

912
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,476
Alice, I’m all right.

913
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,896
Until I’m alone.

914
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,650
And lately, that's all the time.

915
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,778
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

916
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,114
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

917
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:00,865
And you're gone.

918
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,618
And so is Edward.

919
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,000
And there's just nothing now.

920
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,046
You got something, Harry?

921
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,882
Nope. Nothing.

922
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,475
But l realize where l have to go,

923
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,103
what l have to do to see him again.

924
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,451
A tear in my brain

925
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,543
Allows the voices in

926
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:03,261
They wanna push you off the path

927
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,478
With their frequency wires

928
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,614
And you can do no wrong

929
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:35,460
In my eyes

930
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:41,174
You can do no wrong

931
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:54,145
In my eyes

932
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:58,149
A drunken salesman

933
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,151
Your hearing damage

934
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,112
Your mind is restless

935
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,280
They say you're getting better

936
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,617
But you don't feel any better

937
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,751
Your speakers are blowing

938
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:18,920
Your ears are wrecking

939
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,922
Your hearing damage

940
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:25,510
You wish you felt better

941
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,355
You can do no wrong

942
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:53,538
In my eyes

943
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,616
Don't do this.

944
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,706
You wanted me to be human.

945
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,543
Watch me.

946
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:44,589
Please.

947
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:46,883
For me.

948
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,636
You won't stay with me any other way.

949
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,265
Bella, please.

950
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:03,167
This constant noise all the time

951
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:19,517
Even though you're the only one l see

952
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,730
Breathe!

953
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,524
Breathe!

954
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,236
Come on, Bella, breathe!

955
01:22:37,328 --> 01:22:39,954
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?

956
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,670
Jake?

957
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,506
Come here.

958
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:58,264
What the hell were you thinking?

959
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,601
l just wanted to see something.

960
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,772
Get her home!
I’m gonna go help out over at Harry's place.

961
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,818
What happened at Harry's?

962
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,738
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

963
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,991
Charlie and my dad
are over at his place with his family.

964
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:18,576
Is he okay?

965
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,080
He's gone.

966
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:29,337
Come on. I’ll get you something dry
and drive you home.

967
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:43,101
1 08 degrees over here.

968
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:46,187
God!

969
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,273
My hands are freezing.

970
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,945
It must be nice, never getting cold.

971
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,988
It’s a wolf thing.

972
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,116
It’s not.

973
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,618
It’s a Jacob thing.

974
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,954
You're just warm.

975
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:07,291
You're like your own sun.

976
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,590
This is better, now that you know about me.

977
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:19,137
But...

978
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:26,811
You saw what happened to Emily.

979
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:31,733
Sam got angry.

980
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,861
Lost it for a split second.

981
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,364
Em was standing too close.

982
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,494
He'll never be able to take that back.

983
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,166
What if l got mad at you?

984
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,053
Sometimes,

985
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,184
l feel like I’m gonna disappear.

986
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:15,026
Okay, not that you need me

987
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,029
to tell you something like this,

988
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:23,242
but l always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

989
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,331
l wouldn't let that happen.

990
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:31,834
How?

991
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,590
I’ll tell you all the time

992
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,221
how special you are.

993
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,909
Thank you. For everything.

994
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:13,125
Wait.

995
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,630
There's a vampire.

996
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,799
How do you know?

997
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:23,094
l can smell it. I’m getting you out of here.

998
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,471
That's Carlisle's car.

999
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,516
They're here.

1000
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,436
Bella, it's a trick! Stop!
You gotta come with me!

1001
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,608
They won't hurt me.

1002
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:41,112
lf a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

1003
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,948
Treaty says we can only defend
on our own lands.

1004
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:48,119
-l can't protect you here.
-Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

1005
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,373
You're about to cross a line.

1006
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,375
Then don't draw one.

1007
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:55,960
Please?

1008
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,061
Alice?

1009
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,939
-Oh, my God! What are you...
-Bella!

1010
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:21,736
I’m sorry, l just,
l can't believe you're here. Is...

1011
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,156
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

1012
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:26,908
What?

1013
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:30,161
l saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff.

1014
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:33,247
Why in the hell
would you try and kill yourself?

1015
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,457
l mean, what about Charlie?

1016
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,293
-What about...
-l didn't try to kill myself.

1017
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:38,836
I was cliff jumping.

1018
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,671
Recreationally.

1019
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,173
It was fun.

1020
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:48,387
l have never met anyone
more prone to life-threatening idiocy.

1021
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,019
Does...

1022
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,605
Did you tell him?

1023
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:58,773
No.

1024
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:03,194
He only calls in once every few months.

1025
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,031
He said he wants to be alone.

1026
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:16,248
Bella, what is that
God-awful wet dog smell?

1027
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,709
Um...

1028
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,295
That's probably me.

1029
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,548
Or it's Jacob.

1030
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,218
Jacob who?

1031
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,680
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1032
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,393
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.

1033
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:38,562
Speak for yourself.

1034
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,569
l had to see you were safe.

1035
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,907
l thought you couldn't protect me here.

1036
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,909
Guess l don't care.

1037
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,915
Well, I’m not gonna hurt her.

1038
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,419
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1039
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,922
I’m talking about the other bloodsucker
who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1040
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,048
Victoria?

1041
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:08,259
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1042
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,094
l didn't see her.

1043
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:14,140
l didn't see you
get pulled out of the water, either.

1044
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:18,019
l can't see past you and your pack of mutts.

1045
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,229
Don't get me upset...

1046
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:24,483
-Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1047
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,782
I’ll give you a minute.

1048
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:38,873
Hey.

1049
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,543
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,

1050
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:45,421
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.

1051
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:55,806
Is he...

1052
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,479
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here

1053
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,731
and how long are they staying?

1054
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:04,940
No.

1055
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,568
It’s just Alice.

1056
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:14,992
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1057
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:19,789
Well, are the rest coming back?

1058
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:27,171
No.

1059
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,424
Not that l know of.

1060
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,177
Anything else?

1061
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:38,849
That's it.

1062
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,688
Well, if that's all,
then you'd better go run back to Sam.

1063
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,568
I’ve done it again.

1064
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:52,696
l keep breaking my promise.

1065
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:00,704
We don't have to do this to each other.

1066
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,710
Yes, we do.

1067
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:19,890
Bella...

1068
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:44,415
Swan residence.

1069
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:52,256
He's not here right now.

1070
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:54,884
He's arranging a funeral.

1071
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,443
Who was that?

1072
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:13,777
What?

1073
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,654
Always in the way.

1074
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:19,033
Who was that?

1075
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,743
Bella, step back.

1076
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:24,038
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

1077
01:32:24,623 --> 01:32:28,042
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why l came here.

1078
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,963
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1079
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,215
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.

1080
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,885
-l don't care!
-Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi.

1081
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,471
He wants to die, too.

1082
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,517
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1083
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:49,063
No, I’m not gonna let him kill himself
out of guilt.

1084
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:51,607
What about your dad?

1085
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:55,527
I’m 1 8.
I’m legally free to go, and l left a note.

1086
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,031
Please, Bella,

1087
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,576
just stay here.

1088
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,829
For Charlie.

1089
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,209
Or for me.

1090
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:12,795
l have to go.

1091
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,511
I’m begging you.

1092
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,556
Please.

1093
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:27,935
Goodbye, Jacob.

1094
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:37,653
Okay.

1095
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:48,080
)

1096
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,425
So you've made up your minds.

1097
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:44,136
I’m afraid your particular gifts

1098
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:47,598
are too valuable to destroy.

1099
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:53,437
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.

1100
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:58,275
We would be delighted to utilize
your skills.

1101
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:01,779
Won't you consider staying with us?

1102
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:05,908
You know it will happen anyway.

1103
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,910
Not without cause.

1104
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:13,749
Such a waste.

1105
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,758
I’m guessing you didn't rent this car?

1106
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:24,885
l figured you wouldn't be opposed
to grand theft auto.

1107
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,345
Not today.

1108
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:31,350
What? What do you see?

1109
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,310
They refused him.

1110
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:35,813
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.

1111
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,982
-Show himself to the humans.
-No! When?

1112
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:43,070
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at its highest.

1113
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,032
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1114
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:48,992
There's Volterra.

1115
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:16,603
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.

1116
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,481
They're commemorating
the expulsion of vampires from the city.

1117
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:20,899
It’s the perfect setting.

1118
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:23,527
The Volturi will never let him get far enough
to reveal himself.

1119
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,320
We have five minutes.

1120
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:27,698
l know, Bella, just breathe.

1121
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:34,788
Alice!

1122
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:37,040
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1123
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:40,210
lf l go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I’m lying. He'll rush into it.

1124
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:44,298
-Where do l go?
-He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

1125
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,078
Don't!

1126
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,290
Heaven.

1127
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:43,041
You have to move.

1128
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:46,670
Open your eyes. Look at me. I’m alive.

1129
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49,172
You have to move.

1130
01:38:50,008 --> 01:38:51,258
Bella.

1131
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,851
-You're here.
-I’m here.

1132
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:04,896
You're alive.

1133
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,568
Yes.

1134
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:21,622
l needed to make you see me once.

1135
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:23,957
You had to know that l was alive,

1136
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:27,169
that you didn't have
to feel guilty about anything.

1137
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:32,633
l can let you go now.

1138
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,556
l never acted out of guilt.

1139
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:45,520
l just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1140
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,940
-But you said...
-l lied.

1141
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:52,736
l had to lie. But you believed me so easily.

1142
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,995
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1143
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:08,293
l mean, I’m nothing. I’m human. I’m nothing.

1144
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:13,090
Bella, you're everything to me.

1145
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,760
You're everything.

1146
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,538
l won't be needing your services after all,
gentlemen.

1147
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:46,707
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1148
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,041
No rules were broken.

1149
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:52,295
Nonetheless, we should take this
conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1150
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,630
Fine.

1151
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,300
Bella, why don't you go
and enjoy the rest of the festival?

1152
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:58,719
The girl comes with us.

1153
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,512
No. You can go to hell.

1154
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,474
Come on, guys.

1155
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:08,145
It’s a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1156
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,397
We wouldn't.

1157
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:12,107
Enough.

1158
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:14,818
Jane.

1159
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:18,613
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.

1160
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,623
Just do as she says.

1161
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:42,554
Go ahead.

1162
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:48,226
Don't be scared.

1163
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:50,520
Are you?

1164
01:41:51,481 --> 01:41:52,564
No.

1165
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,271
-Is she human?
-Yes.

1166
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,068
Does she know?

1167
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,736
Yes.

1168
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:41,863
Then, why would...

1169
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,283
She wants to be.

1170
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,160
And so she will be.

1171
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:48,662
Or dessert.

1172
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:00,966
Sister. They send you out to get one
and you bring back two.

1173
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,176
And a half.

1174
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:05,720
Such a clever girl.

1175
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,722
What a happy surprise!

1176
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:11,434
Bella is alive after all.

1177
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:14,980
Isn't that wonderful?

1178
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,983
l love a happy ending.

1179
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,068
Ah.

1180
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:24,281
They are so rare.

1181
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:33,623
Her blood appeals to you so much

1182
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,751
it makes me thirsty.

1183
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:39,796
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1184
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:42,966
-It’s not without difficulty.
-Yes, l can see that.

1185
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,259
)

1186
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,973
Aro can read every thought
I’ve ever had with one touch.

1187
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:53,184
And now you know everything.

1188
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,604
So get on with it.

1189
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:01,943
You are quite a soul reader yourself,
Edward.

1190
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:07,824
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1191
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,704
Fascinating.

1192
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:21,630
l would love to see
if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.

1193
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:26,509
Would you do me the honor?

1194
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:48,782
Interesting.

1195
01:44:49,158 --> 01:44:50,158
Hmm.

1196
01:44:50,952 --> 01:44:52,535
l see nothing.

1197
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:03,421
l wonder if...

1198
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,217
Let us see if she's immune
to all our powers.

1199
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:10,261
Shall we, Jane?

1200
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,890
-No!
-Pain.

1201
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,241
Stop!

1202
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:33,827
Stop! Please! Stop!

1203
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:37,747
Stop! Just stop hurting him!
Please! Please!

1204
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:40,709
Jane?

1205
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:43,795
Master?

1206
01:45:48,384 --> 01:45:50,093
Go ahead, my dear.

1207
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,809
This may hurt just a little.

1208
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:15,452
Remarkable!

1209
01:46:17,663 --> 01:46:19,914
She confounds us all.

1210
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:24,127
So what do we do with you now?

1211
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:27,797
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1212
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:30,633
She knows too much.

1213
01:46:31,177 --> 01:46:32,969
She's a liability.

1214
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:35,305
Hmm.

1215
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,475
That's true.

1216
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:43,646
Felix?

1217
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:48,610
No!

1218
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:53,258
Please! No! No! Please, please!

1219
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:59,264
Kill me! Kill me! Not him.

1220
01:48:10,276 --> 01:48:12,819
How extraordinary.

1221
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:18,950
You would give up your life
for someone like us.

1222
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:21,411
A vampire.

1223
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:25,248
A soulless monster.

1224
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:27,333
Just get away from her!

1225
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:35,884
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1226
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:49,189
This is a sadness.

1227
01:48:51,317 --> 01:48:54,903
lf only it were your intention
to give her immortality.

1228
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:05,079
Wait!

1229
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,791
Bella will be one of us.

1230
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:12,003
I’ve seen it.

1231
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,715
I’ll change her myself.

1232
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:51,125
Mesmerizing.

1233
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:55,964
To see what you have seen
before it has happened.

1234
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:03,346
Your gifts will make for an intriguing

1235
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:06,015
immortal,

1236
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:08,643
Isabella.

1237
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:14,941
Go now.

1238
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,610
Make your preparations.

1239
01:50:18,404 --> 01:50:20,405
Let us be done with this.

1240
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:24,534
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1241
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:29,789
Thank you for your visit.

1242
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,416
We will return the favor.

1243
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,460
l would advise that you follow through
on your promise soon.

1244
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,879
We do not offer second chances.

1245
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:41,634
Goodbye, my young friends.

1246
01:50:48,017 --> 01:50:49,809
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1247
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:52,145
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1248
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:53,938
Save some for me.

1249
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:57,734
This way, please. Stay together.

1250
01:51:12,374 --> 01:51:13,916
Stop! Stop!

1251
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:26,304
You're here.

1252
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:29,932
You can sleep.

1253
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:36,356
I’ll still be here when you wake up.

1254
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:42,987
Bella, the only reason l left

1255
01:51:44,782 --> 01:51:47,700
was because l thought
l was protecting you.

1256
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:51,204
l needed you

1257
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:55,249
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1258
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:01,714
It was so easy for you to leave.

1259
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,970
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I’ve done in 1 00 years.

1260
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,312
And l swear,

1261
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:20,316
l will never fail you again.

1262
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,153
I’m so sorry.

1263
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:28,491
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.

1264
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:33,037
You okay?

1265
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,706
I’m fine.

1266
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:41,003
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1267
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:43,506
You know, last time you said that,
you took off.

1268
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,758
l didn't see you for three days.

1269
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:49,345
I’m really sorry, Dad.

1270
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:54,851
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1271
01:52:57,688 --> 01:52:58,771
Ever.

1272
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:03,151
And you're grounded

1273
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,736
for the rest of your life.

1274
01:53:06,905 --> 01:53:08,072
Okay.

1275
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:21,169
I’m not technically
breaking any of his rules.

1276
01:53:24,173 --> 01:53:27,383
He did say
l couldn't take a step inside the door.

1277
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:30,178
l came in through the window.

1278
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:36,309
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1279
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:40,062
l know.

1280
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:43,483
Can you?

1281
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:48,821
l hope you can,

1282
01:53:49,615 --> 01:53:52,825
'cause l honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1283
01:53:57,164 --> 01:53:58,581
Come here.

1284
01:54:16,225 --> 01:54:19,185
Once Alice changes me,

1285
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,273
you can't get rid of me.

1286
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:27,777
She won't need to change you.

1287
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:31,906
There are always ways
to keep the Volturi in the dark.

1288
01:54:33,617 --> 01:54:35,993
No. No.

1289
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:44,794
You all know what l want.

1290
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:49,966
And l know how much I’m asking for.

1291
01:54:52,219 --> 01:54:55,721
The only thing that l can think of
for it to be fair is to just vote.

1292
01:54:55,806 --> 01:54:59,141
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.

1293
01:55:00,769 --> 01:55:01,978
Alice?

1294
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:04,981
l already consider you my sister.

1295
01:55:08,777 --> 01:55:10,403
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1296
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:11,988
l vote "yes."

1297
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:16,909
It would be nice to not
want to kill you all the time.

1298
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:19,787
Hmm.

1299
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:21,247
I’m sorry.

1300
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:26,294
I’m really sorry to both of you
for how I've acted,

1301
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,963
and I’m really grateful
that you were brave enough

1302
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:31,173
to go and save my brother.

1303
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:36,137
But this isn't a life
l would have chosen for myself.

1304
01:55:38,682 --> 01:55:42,351
And l wish that there'd been someone
to vote "no" for me.

1305
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,647
So, no.

1306
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:49,984
I vote "Hell, yeah."

1307
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:54,238
And we can pick a fight
with these Volturi some other way.

1308
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:57,283
I already consider you a part of the family.

1309
01:55:57,909 --> 01:55:59,160
Yes.

1310
01:56:05,042 --> 01:56:07,251
Why are you doing this to me?

1311
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:10,296
You know what this means.

1312
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:14,258
You've chosen not to live without her,
which leaves me no choice.

1313
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:16,886
I won't lose my son.

1314
01:56:23,101 --> 01:56:27,146
I’ll wait until after graduation
to make it easier on Charlie.

1315
01:56:32,152 --> 01:56:35,071
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1316
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:44,163
He wants to talk to me.

1317
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:48,918
So you're still alive for now.

1318
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:51,462
He thinks it's me keeping
you away.

1319
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:54,048
You stay the hell out of my head.

1320
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:58,636
Jacob, I know you have something
to say to me.

1321
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:04,892
But l want to say something to you first,
if that's all right.

1322
01:57:06,019 --> 01:57:07,436
Thank you.

1323
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:13,943
Thank you for keeping Bella alive
when I didn't.

1324
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,612
No. You didn't.

1325
01:57:18,615 --> 01:57:21,242
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1326
01:57:21,326 --> 01:57:23,202
I’m still grateful.

1327
01:57:23,787 --> 01:57:24,995
But I’m here now.

1328
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,790
I’m not gonna leave her side
until she orders me away.

1329
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,208
We'll see.

1330
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:34,255
Hey, my turn to talk.

1331
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:42,346
I’m here to remind you
about a key point in the treaty.

1332
01:57:42,514 --> 01:57:44,390
I haven't forgotten.

1333
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:46,016
What key point?

1334
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:48,561
lf any of them bites a human,

1335
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:51,105
the truce is over.

1336
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:54,316
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1337
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:56,444
No. No, I won't let you.

1338
01:57:58,029 --> 01:58:00,448
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1339
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:02,450
It’s not up to you.

1340
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,494
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

1341
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,246
Bella, please, come.

1342
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:08,497
Wait.

1343
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,085
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1344
01:58:20,427 --> 01:58:21,761
Jake,

1345
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:29,810
I love you.

1346
01:58:34,524 --> 01:58:36,192
So, please,

1347
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:42,823
don't make me choose,

1348
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,539
'cause it'll be him.

1349
01:58:53,877 --> 01:58:55,753
It’s always been him.

1350
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,553
Bella...

1351
01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:15,481
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!

1352
01:59:20,237 --> 01:59:22,238
Bella, get out of here.

1353
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:25,407
Stop!

1354
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:28,869
Stop!

1355
01:59:28,954 --> 01:59:32,039
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1356
01:59:51,059 --> 01:59:52,184
Jake.

1357
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:08,659
He's right.

1358
02:00:09,786 --> 02:00:12,246
You shouldn't become what l am.

1359
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,128
I can't do this alone.

1360
02:00:21,798 --> 02:00:23,757
Then, please, just wait.

1361
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:33,392
Just give me five years.

1362
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:40,649
That's too long.

1363
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,572
Then three?

1364
02:00:51,286 --> 02:00:53,078
You're so stubborn.

1365
02:00:54,956 --> 02:00:57,041
What are you waiting for?

1366
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,844
l have one condition

1367
02:01:11,348 --> 02:01:13,807
if you want me to do it myself.

1368
02:01:17,938 --> 02:01:19,772
What's the condition?

1369
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:22,066
And then forever.

1370
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:25,736
That's what I’m asking.

1371
02:01:37,082 --> 02:01:38,749
Marry me, Bella.

1372
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:17,199
White demon love song down the hall

1373
02:04:18,868 --> 02:04:23,205
White demon shadow on the road

1374
02:04:24,415 --> 02:04:28,544
Back up your mind, there is a call

1375
02:04:29,921 --> 02:04:33,632
He isn't coming after all

1376
02:04:33,716 --> 02:04:35,926
Love this time

1377
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:40,180
She likes the way he sings

1378
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:44,977
White demon love song's in her dreams

1379
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:53,443
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?

1380
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:59,116
White demon sorrow will arrange

1381
02:05:00,285 --> 02:05:04,454
Let's not forget about the fear

1382
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:11,170
Black invitation to this place
that cannot change

1383
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:16,466
While strangely holy

1384
02:05:16,718 --> 02:05:19,928
Come for a rain

1385
02:05:25,435 --> 02:05:30,480
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1386
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:36,361
White demon, who let your friend go?

1387
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:41,325
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1388
02:05:41,951 --> 02:05:48,749
White demon, who let your friend go?

1389
02:05:51,628 --> 02:05:57,049
-Let us be in love
-Let us be in love

1390
02:05:57,133 --> 02:06:02,554
-Let's do old and gray
-Let's do old and gray

1391
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:08,060
-I won't make you cry
-I won't make you cry

1392
02:06:08,144 --> 02:06:13,565
-I will never stray
-I will never stray

1393
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:19,112
-I will do my part
-I will do my part

1394
02:06:19,197 --> 02:06:24,743
Let us be in love tonight

1395
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:30,082
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1396
02:06:30,166 --> 02:06:35,337
White demon, who let your friend go?

1397
02:06:35,755 --> 02:06:40,842
White demon, widen your heart's scope

1398
02:06:41,302 --> 02:06:47,933
White demon, who let your friend go?

1399
02:07:03,992 --> 02:07:08,203
Stand it anymore, darling

1400
02:07:09,372 --> 02:07:10,706
Stand it

1401
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:23,635
Meet me on the equinox

1402
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,471
Meet me halfway

1403
02:07:26,556 --> 02:07:29,850
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1404
02:07:29,934 --> 02:07:33,687
In the middle of the day

1405
02:07:33,771 --> 02:07:37,190
Let me give my love to you

1406
02:07:37,734 --> 02:07:40,444
Let me take your hand

1407
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:44,323
As we walk in the dimming light

1408
02:07:44,407 --> 02:07:47,576
Oh, darling, understand

1409
02:07:47,994 --> 02:08:00,630
That everything, everything ends

1410
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:09,639
Meet me on your best behavior

1411
02:08:09,724 --> 02:08:12,601
Meet me at your worst

1412
02:08:12,685 --> 02:08:16,229
For there will be no stone unturned

1413
02:08:16,314 --> 02:08:19,274
Or bubble left to burst

1414
02:08:19,942 --> 02:08:23,528
Let me lay beside you, darling

1415
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:27,032
Let me be your man

1416
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:30,535
And let our bodies intertwine

1417
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:34,122
But always understand

1418
02:08:34,207 --> 02:08:46,968
That everything, everything ends

1419
02:08:48,262 --> 02:08:54,976
That everything, everything, everything ends

1420
02:08:58,898 --> 02:09:01,483
A window

1421
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:06,154
An opened tomb

1422
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:08,990
The sun crawls

1423
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:12,702
Across your bedroom

1424
02:09:13,162 --> 02:09:15,330
A halo

1425
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:20,210
A waiting room

1426
02:09:20,294 --> 02:09:23,213
Your last breaths

1427
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:25,882
Moving through you

1428
02:09:25,967 --> 02:09:31,221
As everything, everything ends

1429
02:09:32,807 --> 02:09:38,395
As everything, everything, everything

1430
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:44,901
Everything, everything, everything ends

1431
02:09:50,741 --> 02:09:54,536
Meet me on the equinox

1432
02:09:54,912 --> 02:09:57,497
Meet me halfway

1433
02:09:57,582 --> 02:10:01,042
When the sun is perched at its highest peak

1434
02:10:01,127 --> 02:10:04,379
In the middle of the day

1435
02:10:04,922 --> 02:10:08,842
Let me give my love to you

1436
02:10:08,926 --> 02:10:11,470
Let me take your hand

1437
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:15,307
And as we walk in the dimming light

1438
02:10:15,391 --> 02:10:18,560
Oh, darling, understand

1439
02:10:18,728 --> 02:10:22,728
That everything, everything ends
