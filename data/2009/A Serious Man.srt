1
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,548
Dora!

2
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,621
Fagle!

3
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,094
Fagle!

4
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,193
Huh?

5
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,840
All right.
Hold still now.

6
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,350
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

7
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,464
Well...
Oh, sorry.

8
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,761
No, thanks.

9
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,302
Well, you're
in good health.

10
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,029
So how's Judith
and the kids?

11
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,769
Good. Everyone's good,
you know.

12
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,606
Danny must be, what?
About to be bar mitzvahed?

13
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,907
Two weeks.

14
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,972
Well, mazel tov!

15
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,414
They grow up fast,
don't they?

16
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,001
Hmm...

17
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,272
Hmm...

18
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,484
Yeah, you put the...

19
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,518
That's right, you put the...

20
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,984
You following this?

21
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:14,879
Okay?

22
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,381
So...

23
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,583
This part is exciting.

24
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,190
So, am I right?

25
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,728
So, okay So...

26
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,734
So, if that's that,
then we can do this.

27
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,896
And that's SchrÃ¶dinger's Paradox, right?

28
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,597
Is the cat dead?

29
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,673
Or is the cat
not dead?

30
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:38,936
Messages,
Professor Gopnik.

31
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,444
Thank you, Natalie.

32
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,781
Oh, Clive, come in.

33
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,112
So, what can I do for you?

34
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,687
Dr Gopnik, I believe the results

35
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,853
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

36
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
Uh-huh? How so?

37
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,928
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

38
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,263
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

39
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,034
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

40
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,698
Yes, but that is not just.

41
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,910
I was unaware to be
examined on the mathematics.

42
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,141
Well, you can't do physics without
mathematics, really, can you?

43
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,706
If I receive the failing
grade, I lose my scholarship,

44
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,082
and I feel shame.

45
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,819
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

46
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,484
But you can't really
understand the physics

47
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,322
without understanding
the math.

48
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,160
The math tells how it really
works That's the real thing.

49
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,827
The stories I give you in
class are just illustrative.

50
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,770
They're like fables, say,
to help give you a picture.

51
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,137
I mean...

52
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,809
Even I don't understand
the dead cat.

53
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,777
The math is how
it really works.

54
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,178
Very difficult.

55
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,671
Very difficult.

56
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,774
Well, I'm sorry, but I...

57
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,944
What do you propose?

58
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,146
- Passing grade.
- No, no.

59
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,449
Or perhaps I can
take the midterm again.

60
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,286
I know now it cover
the mathematics.

61
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,088
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that, would they?

62
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,688
If one student gets to retake the
test until he gets a grade he likes?

63
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,432
- Secret test
- No...

64
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,133
- Hush-hush.
- No.

65
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,761
That's just not workable.

66
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,864
I'm afraid we'll just have to bite
the bullet on this thing, Clive...

67
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,339
Very troubling.

68
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,303
Very troubling.

69
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,456
Sy Ableman.

70
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,620
Hello, Sy
Larry Gopnik.

71
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,531
Larry. How are you,
my friend?

72
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,289
Good How you been, Sy?

73
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,200
Fine Can
we talk, Larry?

74
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,964
What? You...
Uh...

75
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,305
Hello? Larry?

76
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,635
Call back!

77
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,869
Clive!

78
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,018
That was Sy Ableman.

79
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,490
He said he
got disconnected.

80
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,684
Out in a minute.

81
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,993
I gotta wash my hair.
I'm going out tonight.

82
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,089
I'll be out in a minute.

83
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,667
Jesus Christ!

84
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,428
Why is Uncle Arthur
always in the bathroom?

85
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,769
He has to drain his
sebaceous cyst. You know that.

86
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,898
Will you set the table?

87
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,239
Why can't he do it in the
basement or out in the garage?

88
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,715
I had 20 bucks in it,
too. Inside the case.

89
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,274
Twenty bucks?
How come?

90
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,545
Bought a lid from Mike
Fagle a couple of weeks ago.

91
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,714
Still owed him 20.

92
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,451
He already
gave you the pot?

93
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,888
Yeah. But a couple of weeks
ago, my funding got cut off.

94
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,730
Fagle said he'd pound the crap
out of me if I didn't pay up.

95
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,062
What funding got cut off?
Where do you get your money?

96
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,101
What happened?

97
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,066
Rabbi Turchik took his
radio Had money in it.

98
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,399
That fucker!

99
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,268
Yeah. I think he said
he was confiscating it.

100
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,204
He's a fucker. Where
do you get your money?

101
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,799
Mike Fagle's
gonna kick his ass.

102
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,378
Last week he pounded the
crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer.

103
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,708
He's a fucker!

104
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,942
- Fagle or Seth Seddlemeyer?
- They're both fuckers!

105
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:05,908
Out in a minute!

106
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,077
Are you still in there?

107
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,984
Yeah,
I'll be out in a minute!

108
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,004
Arthur!

109
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,604
- Yeah?
- Dinner!

110
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,745
Okay,
out in a minute!

111
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,978
We should wait.

112
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,314
Are you kidding?

113
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,426
Mr. Brandt keeps mowing
part of our lawn.

114
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:52,961
Does that matter?

115
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,357
What?

116
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,967
Is it important?

117
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,801
It's just odd.

118
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,635
Mom, how long is Uncle
Arthur staying with us?

119
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,265
Ask your father.

120
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,151
Honey.

121
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,217
Honey.

122
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,555
Did you talk to Sy?

123
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,257
Sy?

124
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,227
Sy Ableman That's
right, he called But I...

125
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,858
- You didn't talk to him?
- No.

126
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,405
You know the problems that
you and I have been having?

127
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,531
Mmm-hmm.

128
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,236
Well, Sy and I
have become very close.

129
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,744
In short, I think it's time that
we start talking about a divorce.

130
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,549
Sy Ableman?

131
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
This is not about Sy.

132
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,718
You mentioned Sy!

133
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,887
Don't twist my words,
Larry.

134
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,523
A divorce? What have I done?
I haven't done anything.

135
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,464
Larry, don't be a child.

136
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,298
You haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

137
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,567
Yes! Yes, we haven't
done anything.

138
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,632
And I'm probably
about to get tenure.

139
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,145
Nevertheless, there have
been problems, as you know...

140
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,579
- Well...
- ...and things have changed.

141
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,480
And then, Sy Ableman.

142
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,249
Sy has come into
my life, and I...

143
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,416
Come into your... What does
that mean? You barely know him.

144
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,618
Oh, please We've known the
Ablemans for 15 years, Larry!

145
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,321
Yes, but you said
we hadn't done anything.

146
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,121
I haven't done anything.

147
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,162
This is not some
flashy fling, Larry.

148
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,067
This is not about
woopsy-doopsy.

149
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,635
Sy Ableman?

150
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,601
- I'll be out in a minute!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

151
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,269
Look, I didn't know any other
way of breaking it to you

152
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,144
except to just tell you
and treat you like an adult.

153
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,739
Is that so wrong?

154
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,845
Where do I sleep?

155
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,078
- What?
- Arthur's on the couch.

156
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,780
Look, Sy feels
that we should...

157
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,290
Esther is barely cold!

158
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,293
Esther died three years ago,

159
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,795
and it was a loveless marriage.

160
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,965
Sy wants a get.

161
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,660
- A what?
- A ritual divorce.

162
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,363
He says it's very important.

163
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,499
Without a gett,
I'm an aguna.

164
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,701
A what?

165
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,369
What are you
talking about?

166
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,879
You always act
so surprised.

167
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,472
I have begged you
to see the Rabbi.

168
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,823
Messages,
Professor Gopnik.

169
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,762
Yes, thanks for coming,
Clive. Have a seat.

170
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,108
We had, I think, a
good talk the other day,

171
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,236
...but you left something...
- I didn't leave it.

172
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,046
Well, you don't even know
what I was going to say.

173
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,551
I didn't leave anything.

174
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,053
I'm not missing anything.

175
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,918
I know where everything is.

176
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,122
Well then, Clive...

177
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,585
Where did this come from?

178
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,459
This is here, isn't it?

179
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,401
Yes, sir.
That is there.

180
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,563
This is not nothing.

181
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,970
This is something.

182
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,806
Yes. That is something.

183
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,238
- What is it?
- You know what it is, I believe.

184
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,909
- And you know I can't keep it, Clive.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,883
I'll have to pass it on
to Professor Finkle,

186
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,750
along with my suspicions
about where it came from.

187
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,618
Actions have consequences.

188
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,747
Yes. Often.

189
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,258
No, always! Actions
always have consequences!

190
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:51,228
In this office, actions
have consequences.

191
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,992
- Yes, sir.
- Not just physics,

192
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,326
...morally.
- Yes.

193
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,162
And we both know
about your actions.

194
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,236
No, sir.
I know about my actions.

195
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,933
I can interpret, Clive I know
what you meant me to understand.

196
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,634
Meer sir my sir.

197
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,080
"Meer sir my sir"?

198
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,515
Mere surmise, sir.

199
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,009
Very uncertain.

200
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,482
You little brat fucker!

201
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,682
You snuck 20 bucks
out of my drawer!

202
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,854
Studying Torah,
asshole.

203
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,893
You little brat!
I'm telling Dad!

204
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,355
You gonna tell him you've been
sneaking it out of his wallet?

205
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,661
You know what I'm gonna do, you
little brat, if you don't give it back?

206
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,663
Dad?

207
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,333
Dad, you've
gotta fix the aerial.

208
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,396
Hello, Larry. Have you
thought about a lawyer?

209
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,804
- Dad!
- Honey, please!

210
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:10,967
We're not getting
channel four at all.

211
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,340
Can we
discuss it later?

212
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,571
I can't get F Troop.

213
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,010
Larry, the
children know.

214
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,479
Do you think
this is some secret?

215
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,072
Do you think this is something
we're going to keep quiet?

216
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,741
Dad, Uncle Arthur is
in the bathroom again,

217
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,012
and I'm going
to the Hole at 8:00.

218
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,348
- Out in a minute!
- Ow! Stop!

219
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,412
- She keeps doing that!
- What's going on?

220
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,346
Arthur?

221
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:55,777
Yes?

222
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,589
What are you doing?

223
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,185
Working on the Mentaculus.

224
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,899
Any luck, um,

225
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,026
looking for an apartment?

226
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,397
No.

227
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,489
- Sy.
- Good to see you, Larry.

228
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,317
I'll get Judith.

229
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,331
No, listen, actually, I'm
here to see you, if I might.

230
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,898
Such a thing
Such a thing.

231
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,994
Shall we go
in the kitchen?

232
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:50,838
You know, Larry, the way we
handle ourselves in this situation,

233
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,108
so important.

234
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,907
- Uh-huh?
- Absolutely.

235
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,504
Judith told me that she
broke the news to you,

236
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,641
and she said that
you were very adult.

237
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,619
- Did she?
- Absolutely.

238
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,081
The respect she has
for you...

239
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,686
- Yes?
- Do you drink wine?

240
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,287
Because this is
an incredible bottle.

241
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,622
This is not
Mogen David, Larry.

242
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,425
This is a wine A Bordeaux.

243
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,125
- You know, Sy...
- Open it.

244
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,793
Let it breathe.
Ten minutes.

245
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,337
Letting it breathe,
so important.

246
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,201
Thanks, Sy,
but I'm not...

247
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,797
Listen, I insist, Larry.
There's no cause for discomfort.

248
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,935
I'd be uncomfortable
if you didn't take it.

249
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,138
Larry, listen.
These are signs.

250
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,475
Tokens, Larry.

251
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,947
I'm just...
I'm not ungrateful.

252
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,278
I just don't know
a lot about wine,

253
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,875
...and given our...
- It's okay.

254
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,647
...respective...
- It's okay.

255
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,349
Larry, we're
going to be fine.

256
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,567
Want some of this,
fucker?

257
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,427
Fuck.

258
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,562
Would you read this?
Tell me what you think?

259
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,625
Okay.

260
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,033
Boy! You should have
worn a hat.

261
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,429
Let's see
some hustle, Mitch.

262
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,503
Larry?

263
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,012
Hi, Arlen.

264
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:07,812
Larry, I feel that as head of the
tenure committee, I should tell you this.

265
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,624
Though it should be no cause for concern,
and you should not at all be worried.

266
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,016
Okay.

267
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,651
But I feel
I should mention it,

268
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,688
even though it will carry
no weight in our decision

269
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,358
on whether or not
to grant you tenure.

270
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,130
So again,
no cause for concern.

271
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,638
Okay, Arlen
Give what any weight?

272
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,240
Well...

273
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,402
We've received
a number of letters

274
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:38,510
denigrating you
and urging us not to...

275
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,244
Not to grant you tenure.

276
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,055
From who?

277
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,682
Well, they're anonymous,
so we dismiss them completely.

278
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,160
Well, what do they say?

279
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,757
Well, they
make allegations...

280
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,889
Well, allegations...
Assertions.

281
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,868
And though we give them
no credence at all, Larry.

282
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,194
Well, I'm not really
at liberty

283
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,867
to discuss the specifics of
the committee's deliberations.

284
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,673
But I think you're saying these won't
play any part in your deliberations?

285
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,043
None whatsoever.

286
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,081
So what are they?

287
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,014
Moral turpitude,
you could say.

288
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,181
Uh-huh. Can I ask? Are they...

289
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,281
- Are they idiomatic?
- Hmm?

290
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:24,192
The reason I ask, I have a
Korean student. South Korean.

291
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,130
A disgruntled South Korean, and I
meant to talk to you about this...

292
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:33,398
Oh, no, no They're competently,
even eloquently written.

293
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,066
A native English speaker.
There's no question about that.

294
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,542
- Uh-huh.
- Let me reiterate.

295
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,078
No cause for concern.

296
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:45,981
I only speak because I
would feel odd concealing it.

297
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,711
- Yes.
- Yeah.

298
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,812
Best to Judith.

299
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,994
I gotta get
my radio back.

300
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,293
Maybe the fucker lodged
it up his fucking asshole.

301
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,733
I gotta get it back, or Mike Fagle's
gonna pound the crap out of me.

302
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,270
Way up his asshole.

303
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,679
Good afternoon.

304
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:27,747
Go scrub up, Mitch.

305
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,953
Been hunting?

306
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,968
Is that a...

307
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,470
It's gonna be
a boat shed.

308
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,835
Uh-huh.

309
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,929
That's great.

310
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,976
- Mr. Brandt...
- I said scrub up, Mitch!

311
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,316
Isn't this a school day?

312
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,444
I took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad.

313
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,554
Uh, Mr Brandt,

314
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,627
that's just about at
the property line there.

315
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,059
I don't think
we're supposed to get

316
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,789
...within, what, 10 feet...
- Property line's the poplar.

317
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,294
- The...
- Poplar.

318
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,630
- Well, even if it is, you're just
about over it. - Measure.

319
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,706
- I don't have to measure, you
can tell it's... - Line's the poplar.

320
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,200
What's going on?

321
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,667
Nothing.

322
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,177
- Larry?
- Yeah?

323
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,841
Did you go to
Sieglestein Schlutz?

324
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,009
No, I...
Not yet.

325
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,143
Larry.

326
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,481
Appointment Monday.

327
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,851
Where are you going?

328
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,184
I'm going to the Hole.

329
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,849
What? At 5:00?

330
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,416
We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's
house so I can wash my hair.

331
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,052
Hi, Mr Gopnik.

332
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,591
- You can't wash it here?
- Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

333
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,257
I'll be out
in a minute!

334
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,425
- Are you ready?
- Huh?

335
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,025
- We're meeting Sy at Embers.
- I am?

336
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,435
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

337
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,669
Larry.

338
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,104
How are you?

339
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,940
Sy.

340
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,543
Hello, Judith.

341
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,609
Hello, Sy.

342
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,088
Larry, I want to
thank you for coming.

343
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,921
It's so important that we be
able to discuss these things.

344
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,726
I'm happy to come
to Embers, Sy.

345
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,290
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

346
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,733
these discussions
to the lawyers.

347
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,636
Of course Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

348
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,731
You don't mix
apples and oranges.

349
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,241
I have begged you
to see the lawyer.

350
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,572
I told you,
I'm going Monday.

351
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,306
Monday is timely.
This is not...

352
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,077
Please, Embers is not the forum
for legalities You're so right.

353
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,811
No, Judith and I wanted
merely to discuss, uh,

354
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,090
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

355
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,259
After all, this is an issue
where no one is at odds.

356
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,490
Living arrangements?

357
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,896
I think we all agree
that the children

358
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,063
not being contaminated
with the tension,

359
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,265
the most important.

360
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,331
We shouldn't put the kids
in the middle of this, Larry.

361
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,466
The kids aren't...

362
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,476
I'm saying "we."
I'm not pointing fingers.

363
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,274
No one is playing
the blame game, Larry.

364
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,440
I didn't say
anyone was.

365
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,484
Well, let's not play "He
Said, She Said," either.

366
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,609
- I wasn't! I...
- All right. Look, look, look.

367
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,452
Let's just take a step back and
we can diffuse the situation.

368
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,153
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

369
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,924
if I count to 10...

370
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,924
One,

371
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,191
two,

372
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,762
three,

373
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,435
four...

374
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,707
Or silently.

375
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,813
Really, to keep things
on an even keel

376
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,787
leading up to
Danny's bar mitzvah...

377
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,653
A child's
bar mitzvah, Larry.

378
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,455
Sy and I think it's best if
you move out of the house.

379
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,785
Move out?

380
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,331
- Well, it makes eminent sense.
- Things can't continue as they...

381
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,867
Move out?
Where would I go?

382
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:00,028
Well, for instance, the
Jolly Roger is quite livable.

383
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,400
It's not expensive.

384
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,066
The rooms are
eminently habitable.

385
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,665
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

386
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,836
There's convenience in its
favor They've got a pool.

387
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,574
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to move in with Sy?

388
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,642
Larry.

389
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,180
Larry, you...
You are jesting.

390
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,021
I think, really,
the Jolly Roger

391
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,152
is the appropriate
course of action.

392
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,693
Listen here,

393
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,429
you little fucker,
I want my money!

394
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,832
Stop it!
I'm gonna get it!

395
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,862
Give it back!

396
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,566
You owe me 20 bucks,
you little shit!

397
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,608
- Don't worry about it!
- Give it, brat fucker!

398
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,211
- I'm gonna get it! I'm gonna get it!
- Brat! Fucker!

399
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,940
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

400
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,342
- What was that?
- Nothing.

401
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,076
How's the Torah
portion coming?

402
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,554
Can you maybe
use the hi-fi?

403
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,886
- What?
- Can I borrow this?

404
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,860
I'm taking some stuff to,
you know, the Jolly Roger.

405
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,055
- Dad!
- Sure, Dad.

406
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,121
Dad! Chinese guy!

407
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,691
Culture clash.

408
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,596
Culture clash.

409
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,708
With all respect, Mr. Park,
I don't think it's that.

410
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,072
- Yes.
- No,

411
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,738
it would be a culture clash if
it were the custom in your land

412
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,246
to bribe people
for grades.

413
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,441
Yes.

414
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,145
So, you're saying
it is the custom?

415
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,552
No, this is defamation.
Ground for lawsuit.

416
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,249
Let me get this straight.

417
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,919
You're threatening to sue
me for defaming your son?

418
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,120
Yes.

419
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,993
- But it would...
- Is this man bothering you?

420
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,963
Is he bothering me? No.

421
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,166
I, uh...

422
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,843
See, look...

423
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,608
If it were defamation,
there would have to be

424
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,775
someone I was defaming him to, or I...

425
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,909
All right,
let's keep it simple.

426
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:58,422
I could pretend the money never
appeared That's not defaming anyone.

427
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,855
Yes. And passing grade.

428
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,153
- Passing grade?
- Yes.

429
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,754
Or you'll sue me?

430
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,956
For taking money.

431
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,794
So he did leave the money?

432
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,128
This is defamation!

433
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,463
It doesn't make sense. Either
he left the money or he didn't.

434
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,871
Please.
Accept the mystery.

435
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,041
Give me that, fucker.

436
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,616
He's very
good with numbers.

437
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,055
I think his social skills
have held him back.

438
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,149
Such a sweet man, though.

439
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,524
Arthur has
a good heart.

440
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,029
And he never complains,
unlike me.

441
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,000
Sometimes I don't
give him enough credit.

442
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,834
He tried to tell me about this
thing he's working on, this...

443
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,736
The Mentaculus.

444
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:56,070
He says it's a probability
map of the universe.

445
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,413
Does he go out
socially at all?

446
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,509
He tries. He's been going to the
singles mixers at Hillel House.

447
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,055
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

448
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,689
How is Judith?

449
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,526
Fine. She's fine.

450
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:20,371
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

451
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:24,340
And it can take a while before
you feel what was always there.

452
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,775
- For better or worse.
- I never felt it!

453
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,077
It was a bolt
from the blue.

454
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,375
What does that mean?

455
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:35,215
Everything that I thought was
one way turns out to be another.

456
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:40,918
Then, it's an opportunity to
learn how things really are.

457
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,692
I don't mean to sound glib.

458
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,794
It's not always easy deciphering
what God is trying to tell you,

459
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,531
but it's not something you have
to figure out all by yourself.

460
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,301
We're Jews.

461
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,710
We've got that well of tradition
to draw on, to help us understand.

462
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,075
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

463
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,879
that have been handed down from
people who had the same problems.

464
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,912
Have you talked to
Rabbi Nachtner?

465
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,627
Why not see him?

466
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,388
What's the Rabbi
gonna tell me?

467
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,491
If I knew,
I'd be the Rabbi.

468
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:24,563
The air out
here is magnificent.

469
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,167
I'm telling you, if someone
could bottle this air,

470
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,071
they'd make
a million dollars.

471
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,760
Hello, Larry.
Good to see you.

472
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,193
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

473
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,658
I thought I was going
to see Rabbi Nachtner.

474
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,859
He was called away
on an etz monim.

475
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,666
Ruth Brynn's mother is in the
hospital and she isn't doing well.

476
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:05,037
Rabbi Nachtner asked me to
cover for him. Come on in.

477
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,122
And she wants a gett.

478
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,221
A what?

479
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,697
- She wants a...
- Oh, a gett.

480
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,359
Uh-huh. Sure.

481
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,833
I feel like the carpet's
been yanked out from under me.

482
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,171
I don't
know which end is up.

483
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,039
I'm not even sure
how to react.

484
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,475
I'm too confused.

485
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,576
What reasons did she
give for the rupture?

486
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,243
She didn't give reasons
Just that,

487
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,582
you know, things
haven't been going well.

488
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,746
And is that true?

489
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,913
I guess.
I don't know.

490
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,186
She's usually right
about these things.

491
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,728
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could...

492
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,255
That he would...
He would... Yes?

493
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,595
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

494
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,528
No offense.

495
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:08,766
No, of course
not I am the junior rabbi.

496
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,206
And it's true, the point of
view of somebody who's older

497
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:17,714
and perhaps had similar
problems might be more valid.

498
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,842
And you should see the senior
rabbi as well, by all means.

499
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,112
Or even Marshak,

500
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,383
if you can get in.

501
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,049
He's quite busy,
but maybe...

502
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,919
Can I share
something with you?

503
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,198
Because I, too, have had
the feeling of losing track

504
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,065
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

505
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,402
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

506
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,532
and when that happens,
you think,

507
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,602
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone."

508
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,471
But that's not the case.

509
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,974
You just need to
remember how to see him.

510
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,383
Am I right? I mean...

511
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,479
The parking lot here.

512
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,926
Not much to see.

513
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,258
But if you imagine
yourself a visitor,

514
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,001
somebody who isn't familiar
with these autos and such,

515
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,663
somebody still with
the capacity for wonder.

516
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,935
Someone with
a fresh perspective.

517
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,806
That's what it is, Larry.

518
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,935
Because with
the right perspective,

519
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:25,471
you can see Hashem, you
know, reaching into the world.

520
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,313
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

521
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,923
It sounds to me like you're looking
at the world, looking at your wife,

522
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,925
through tired eyes.

523
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,189
It sounds like she's
become a sort of thing...

524
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,455
A problem.

525
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,126
A thing.

526
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,328
She is seeing Sy Ableman.

527
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,973
- Oh.
- They're planning...

528
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,511
That's why
they want the gett.

529
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,842
Oh I'm sorry.

530
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,471
It was his idea.

531
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:03,987
Well, they do need a gett
to remarry in the faith.

532
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,214
But... This is life.

533
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,060
You have to see these things
as expressions of God's will.

534
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,064
You don't have to
like it, of course.

535
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,831
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

536
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,699
That's right!

537
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,532
Things aren't so bad.

538
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,903
Look at
the parking lot, Larry.

539
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,806
Just look at
that parking lot.

540
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,089
Are we eating already?

541
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,595
Sarah's going out.

542
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,561
Ow! Cut it out!

543
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,894
What's going on?

544
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,196
Isn't Dad eating?

545
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,605
He's at
the Jolly Roger.

546
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,905
Oh, yeah.

547
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,375
How are you, Larry?

548
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,942
Jesus, I am so sorry

549
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,578
- to be seeing you under these
circumstances. - Oh, well...

550
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,250
I always thought you
and Judy were rock solid.

551
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,590
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

552
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:20,061
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

553
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,692
it's an opportunity for me to
really sit down and figure things out

554
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:28,034
and look at the world afresh
instead of just, you know,

555
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,041
settling for the routine, tired
old way of looking at things.

556
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:34,937
Really?

557
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,714
I don't know,
maybe not.

558
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,716
Well, legally,
I have to warn you,

559
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,255
it's never easy
for the husband.

560
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,155
Unless, of course,
there's some question

561
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,491
of the wife having violated
the marriage contract?

562
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,621
Oh, no, no
Nothing like that.

563
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,292
Although she is planning to
marry Sy Ableman, but they...

564
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,766
Sy Ableman!

565
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,931
- Yes. But they...
- Esther is barely cold!

566
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,072
She passed
three years ago.

567
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:09,340
Well... Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

568
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,179
Sy Ableman.

569
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,080
Not in the sense that... T
here hasn't been hanky-panky.

570
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,243
To my knowledge.

571
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,617
- Oh? - No I'm fairly
certain this is not an issue.

572
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,852
And in fact,
Judith wants a gett.

573
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,520
A what?

574
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,187
A ritual divorce.

575
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,426
- Oh.
- So that they can remarry in the faith.

576
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,765
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh...

577
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,862
Well, not really
a legal issue.

578
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,036
Okay, um...

579
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,974
Good. Good.

580
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,474
Well...

581
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,983
On the other thing, the
neighbor's property line,

582
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,679
I've asked Solomon
Schlutz to take a look.

583
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:53,154
There's very little to do with
real estate that'll get by Sol.

584
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,987
Okay Good
How do you...

585
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,549
I guess
I'm a little worried.

586
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,821
How do you...
I have money pressures...

587
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,989
Our fee structure?
We bill by the hour.

588
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:04,330
Dave Sieglestein and
Solomon Schlutz bill at 110.

589
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,234
The associates, me,
for instance, bill at...

590
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,806
Call for Mr Gopnik
Danny at home.

591
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,899
You can take it here.

592
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:15,204
0809.

593
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,136
Danny?

594
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,842
- Hey, Dad.
- Are you all right?

595
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:20,906
Are you all...

596
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,383
F Troop is fuzzy.

597
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,517
What?

598
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,352
F Troop is still fuzzy.

599
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,092
- Dad?
- Is everything okay?

600
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:59,838
Clive?

601
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,109
Clive!

602
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,788
You little bastard! You
gonna send your mother next?

603
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,692
Little bastard!
I want to see you!

604
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:22,527
Hold on.

605
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,999
Professor Gopnik,
it's Dick Dutton again.

606
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,867
Dick Dutton.

607
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:29,970
Hello?

608
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,605
Hello, Mr Gopnik?

609
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:34,378
This is Dick Dutton from
the Columbia Record Club.

610
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,511
I'm calling because
it's now four months,

611
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,987
and we have yet to
receive your first payment.

612
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,983
There's some mistake.

613
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:46,393
I'm not a member
of the Columbian Record Club.

614
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:50,194
Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik
of 8419 Fern Hill Road?

615
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,995
No, I live
at the Jolly Roger.

616
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,161
Excuse me?

617
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,134
No, I...

618
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,201
Well, yes, okay.

619
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,208
- Yes, you are Lawrence Gopnik?
- Okay.

620
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:01,969
"Okay" means...

621
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,310
Okay, yes,
Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

622
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay, well, you received
your 12 introductory albums,

623
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,979
and you've been receiving the monthly
main selection for four months now...

624
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,682
The monthly main selection?
Is that a record?

625
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,519
I didn't ask
for any records.

626
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,754
To receive the monthly main
selection, you do nothing. You...
