1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,668
I am, beyond a doubt,
the last of the old-timers.

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,006
My name is Jack Crabb.

3
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:25,843
And I am the sole white survivor

4
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:29,096
of the Battle
of Little Big Horn...

5
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:31,098
uh... uh...

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,896
popularly known
as Custer's Last Stand.

7
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,939
Well...

8
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:42,818
Mr. Crabb, I'm more interested

9
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:46,447
in the primitive lifestyle
of the Plains Indian

10
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:49,741
than I am in the...

11
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:54,871
tall tales about Custer.

12
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:58,333
Tall tales?!

13
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,627
Are you calling me a liar?

14
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:01,711
- No, no...
- Huh?

15
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:04,381
No, it's just that...

16
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:08,176
I'm interested
in the way of life

17
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:13,680
of the Indian rather than,
shall we say, adventure.

18
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:18,685
You think the Battle of Little
Big Horn was... was a...

19
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,647
...was an adventure?

20
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:24,316
Oh, shit.

21
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:29,238
Little Big Horn was not
representative of...

22
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:32,700
encounters between Whites
and Indians, Mr. Crabb.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,954
You see the...
near genocide of the Indian...

24
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:39,872
The... the... the near what?!

25
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:40,998
Near genocide.

26
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:47,296
It means: "extermination;

27
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:52,385
the killing off
of an entire people."

28
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:56,514
That's practically
what we did to the Indian.

29
00:01:56,556 --> 00:02:01,519
But of course, I wouldn't expect
an old Indian fighter like you

30
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:07,816
to agree with me.

31
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:09,067
Turn that thing on.

32
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,819
I beg your pardon?

33
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,821
I said, turn that thing on

34
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:15,449
and shut up.

35
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,873
Now you just set there,
and you'll learn something.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,172
I knowed General
George Armstrong Custer

37
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:34,842
for what he was.

38
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:41,932
And I also knowed the Indians...
for what they was.

39
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:54,778
111 years ago,
when I was ten years old,

40
00:02:54,778 --> 00:03:02,619
my family...
in crossin' the Great Plains...

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,709
was wiped out
by a band of wild Indians.

42
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:54,502
Everybody was killed or drug off
by them murderin' varmints,

43
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,714
except me
and my sister Caroline.

44
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,820
Good-bye, Jack.

45
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:52,740
I'll see you in heaven.

46
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,784
Good-bye, Caroline.

47
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:28,442
We didn't know
the difference then,

48
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:30,819
but it was a band of Pawnee
what attacked us before.

49
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:35,198
I ain't had no use for Pawnee
ever since.

50
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,242
But this one wasn't a Pawnee.

51
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,162
He was a Cheyenne brave.

52
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:43,622
I later got to know him well.

53
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:46,584
His name was
Shadow That Comes In Sight.

54
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:24,454
At first sight
of an Indian camp,

55
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:29,666
what you think is, "I see
their dump, where's the camp?"

56
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,519
He brought us to their chief.

57
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:53,898
His name was Old Lodge Skins,
who later become my granddaddy.

58
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,493
What do they want, Caroline?

59
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:09,080
It's as plain as day
what they want, Jack.

60
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,206
What?

61
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:13,084
Me.

62
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,420
To show good manners,

63
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:21,133
Old Lodge Skins smoked
with our oldest male survivor.

64
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:06,134
They didn't know I was a woman.

65
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:11,431
That explains why
they didn't rape me right off.

66
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:14,726
I don't think they're gonna
bother you, Caroline.

67
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:19,606
No such luck, Jack.

68
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:24,194
They'll get me tonight,
for sure.

69
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:40,834
Poor Caroline never did
have no luck with men.

70
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:08,152
I reckoned she figured
we both couldn't get away,

71
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,322
and she'd send help back
to rescue me.

72
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:17,245
Next morning, I found myself
in that Indian camp all alone.

73
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:28,005
But the Cheyenne, who call
themselves the "Human Beings,"

74
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:31,216
had no idea to hurt me.

75
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,676
I was an honored guest,

76
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:36,346
and they gave me a real treat
for breakfast: Boiled dog.

77
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,765
Dog ain't bad, neither.

78
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,476
Now dog is greasy, I'll admit,
but you'd be surprised

79
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:44,228
how downright delicate
the flavor is,

80
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,689
especially when you're starving.

81
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:51,027
You see, the Human Beings
adopted me as one of their own.

82
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,863
Shadow That Comes In Sight
taught me the bow and arrow

83
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,532
and how to stalk game.

84
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,784
Burns Red In The Sun

85
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,580
showed me how to protect
my pale skin from sunburn.

86
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,833
It's a little known fact that
some Indians, like Burns Red,

87
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,085
will sunburn their own selves.

88
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,714
But my real teacher
was my adopted grandpa,

89
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,799
Old Lodge Skins.

90
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,762
He taught me to read a trail,
the Cheyenne language,

91
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,264
and lots of other things.

92
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,857
For a boy,
it was a kind of paradise.

93
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,026
I wasn't just playing Indian,

94
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,236
I was living Indian.

95
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:47,956
Only one thing bothered me.

96
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,792
I was small for my years.

97
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,460
In fact, a durn near runt.

98
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,253
The Pawnee stole
seven of our ponies.

99
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,089
There's gonna be a war party.

100
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,257
But you can't go.

101
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,301
You're too little
and weak like a girl.

102
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:06,265
Run away now or I'll kick you.

103
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,022
The Indians had never heard
of fistfightin',

104
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,525
and it plum amazed 'em.

105
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,943
How did you do that?

106
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,531
I'm sorry, Younger Bear.

107
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,949
I didn't mean to hurt you.

108
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,661
The Indian way...
you should never feel sorry

109
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:30,080
about beating an enemy unless
having conquered his body,

110
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:33,959
you want his spirit as well.

111
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:37,921
I had made the first
real enemy of my life.

112
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:44,553
There once was a Human Being,
and he was very small,

113
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,971
but he won a name:

114
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,806
Little Man.

115
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,224
You've heard of him.

116
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,517
No, Grandfather.

117
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:58,190
He went on a war party
against the Pawnees.

118
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:01,861
But the Pawnees were many.

119
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:06,073
One by one, the Human
Beings were rubbed out.

120
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:09,493
Little Man was very brave.

121
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,662
The Pawnees called out to him,

122
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:15,874
"If you will quit fighting,
we will let you go."

123
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:22,505
But Little Man answered,
"It's a good day to die."

124
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,549
Finally, they cut off his head.

125
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:28,678
But he kept fighting
without his head.

126
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,182
He rode among the Pawnees
like a whirlwind.

127
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:35,685
And his head...
it was stuck on a spear...

128
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,520
started to shout the war cry.

129
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:54,286
The Pawnees could take no more,
and they ran away.

130
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:55,663
When they looked back,

131
00:13:55,704 --> 00:14:01,502
they saw the body of Little Man
lie down among his friends.

132
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:08,049
Little Man was small,
but his bravery was big.

133
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:34,282
The Human Beings don't require

134
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:37,077
a boy to be a warrior
if he ain't got

135
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,787
the temperament for it,

136
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,497
and Little Horse didn't.

137
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:44,501
If he wanted to stay behind
with the women

138
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:47,671
that was all right
with the Human Beings.

139
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:11,152
We will leave the ponies here.

140
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:12,820
You two will hold them.

141
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:15,489
No! I don't want to stay here.

142
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,449
I want to go to the Pawnee camp.

143
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,096
You!

144
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:43,098
You aren't even a Human Being!

145
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,601
You're white.

146
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,853
He didn't believe it himself.

147
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,813
Younger Bear was just trying

148
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,940
to hand me
the worst possible insult.

149
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,554
Little white man.

150
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:27,100
Fool poor Pawnee.

151
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:33,897
Big fooling.

152
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,482
You want to eat?

153
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:39,444
Shit, Pawnees was always
sucking up to whites.

154
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:41,905
Little white man not mad, huh?

155
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,371
See? Pawnee friend.

156
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:52,708
See?!

157
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,960
Fixes bad Injun
for little white man.

158
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,888
I always felt kind of bad
about that poor Pawnee.

159
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,767
I didn't mean to kill him.

160
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,978
I just meant to distract him.

161
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,817
I had made a real enemy
of Younger Bear.

162
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,568
I give you these ponies...

163
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,113
but... I owe you a life.

164
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:28,366
Saving his life
was the final insult.

165
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,828
This boy is no longer a boy.

166
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:33,121
He's a brave.

167
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:38,251
He is little in body,
but his heart is big.

168
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:42,422
His name shall be
"Little Big Man."

169
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,361
I don't understand it,
Grandfather.

170
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:52,114
Why would they kill
women and children?

171
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,408
Because they are strange.

172
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,873
They do not seem to know
where the center

173
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,208
of the Earth is.

174
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:26,896
We must have
a war on these cowards

175
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:29,482
and teach them a lesson.

176
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:58,010
This will be the first time,
my son,

177
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:00,804
I face the whites as an enemy.

178
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:06,268
I don't know
whether you remember

179
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,021
before you became a Human Being,

180
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:12,941
and as dear a son to me as those

181
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,985
I made with Buffalo Wallow
Woman and the others...

182
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:21,449
But I won't speak of
that unfortunate time.

183
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:25,912
I just want to say,
if you believe

184
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:29,874
riding against these
white creatures is bad,

185
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,585
you can stay out of the fight.

186
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,838
No one will think the worse.

187
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:42,260
Grandfather,

188
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:44,971
I think it's a good day to die.

189
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:51,478
My heart soars like a hawk.

190
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:00,904
I'm sorry to say
that Old Lodge Skins' war

191
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:03,240
against the whites
was kind of pitiful.

192
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,868
Not that the Human Being
wasn't brave.

193
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,328
No warrior ever
walked the earth

194
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,039
more brave than a Human Being.

195
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:21,841
Old Lodge Skins' idea of war
and the whites' idea of war

196
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:23,968
were kind of different.

197
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,595
Half our party
didn't even use weapons.

198
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,597
What they done was "take coup,"

199
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:30,890
hit the enemy
with a little stick.

200
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,934
Humiliate them.

201
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:35,729
That was how the Human Beings
taught a coward a lesson

202
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,147
and won a war.

203
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:38,773
Shadow!

204
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,775
Look at 'em go!

205
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,611
We got 'em runnin', boys!

206
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,488
Go get that black bastard!

207
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:54,289
Shooting rifles
against bow and arrow.

208
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:57,624
I never could understand
how the white world

209
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,377
could be so proud of winning
with them kind of odds.

210
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,856
God bless George Washington!

211
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:25,652
Before I knowed it, them words
just popped out of my mouth.

212
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:27,737
God bless my mother!

213
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:33,951
You murdering fool!

214
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:38,414
Got to cut your throat to get it
through your head

215
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:39,457
I'm a white man.

216
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:40,625
White?

217
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:45,671
Sure I'm white.

218
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:47,964
Didn't you hear me say
"God bless George Washington"?

219
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:48,965
"God bless my mother"?

220
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:50,759
I mean, now, what kind
of Indian would say

221
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:51,802
a fool thing like that?

222
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:55,347
Lend me that
to get off this paint.

223
00:22:58,183 --> 00:22:59,935
Yeah.

224
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:02,104
The troopers took me
under their wing

225
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:05,232
and turned me over
to the Reverend Silas Pendrake

226
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:06,441
for moral guidance

227
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:08,944
and a Christian upbringing.

228
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:11,237
Can you drive a buggy, boy?

229
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,279
Oh, yes, sir.

230
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:13,322
I can do it.

231
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:14,615
You're a liar, boy.

232
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:16,784
If you was reared by the Indians

233
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:19,286
how could you learn
to drive a buggy?

234
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:22,289
We shall have to beat
the lying out of you.

235
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,141
Oh, dear Jack.

236
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:44,769
Welcome to your new home.

237
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:51,401
Your travail is over,
enfolded now as you are

238
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:53,361
in Christian love.

239
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:56,990
Well, boy,
are you unable to converse?

240
00:23:57,032 --> 00:23:59,658
Huh?

241
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,161
No, I'm glad to meet
your daughter, sir.

242
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,788
You are addressing my wife, boy.

243
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:06,999
Poor boy.

244
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,626
Poor darling.

245
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:12,004
Think of the years
of suffering,

246
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:16,216
deprivation and hardship
among those awful savages.

247
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:19,637
The boy's deprivation, my dear,

248
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,473
has been more spiritual
than physical.

249
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:25,183
The Indians know nothing of God

250
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,018
and moral right.

251
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,354
They eat human flesh,

252
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,314
fornicate,

253
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:32,732
adulterize,

254
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:36,986
misogynize and
commune constantly

255
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,655
with minions of the devil.

256
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:43,534
It must be our task,
nay, our Christian duty,

257
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:45,203
to beat the misery out...

258
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:47,038
Beat the poor boy?

259
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,539
Not while there's
a breath left in my body.

260
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:50,999
I could have kissed her.

261
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,877
Well, I didn't mean
beat him literally, my dear.

262
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,255
I meant to beat him
symbolically.

263
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,340
Poor boy.

264
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:01,385
He hasn't even had
a proper bath.

265
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:04,346
His darling neck is so...
I detect the odor of food.

266
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:06,139
I shall wash this poor,
dirty boy.

267
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,140
It's suppertime!

268
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:08,934
Silas,

269
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:11,979
it is my Christian duty
to give this boy an immediate

270
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,063
thorough bath.

271
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:15,231
Take off your clothes, dear.

272
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,565
Take my clothes off?

273
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:17,608
Yes.

274
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,734
All of them?

275
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,487
E-Every stitch.

276
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:26,617
But I shall avert my eyes
at the necessary moment.

277
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,915
Bringing in

278
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:35,209
The sheaves

279
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:38,837
Bringing in the sheaves

280
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:42,632
We shall come rejoicing

281
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:46,303
Bringing in the sheaves.

282
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:50,223
Greatest bath
I ever had in my life.

283
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:56,771
Shall we gather at the river,

284
00:25:56,813 --> 00:26:04,153
The beautiful,
the beautiful river?

285
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:14,872
You do realize,
don't you, dear Jack,

286
00:26:14,913 --> 00:26:19,626
that the Reverend Pendrake
is not altogether wrong.

287
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:20,711
What?

288
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:22,463
What, ma'am?

289
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:26,925
Well, Jesus is your savior.

290
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:30,470
You do realize that,
don't you dear Jack?

291
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:33,056
Oh, Lordy, yes, Mrs. Pendrake.

292
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,808
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?

293
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,185
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am.

294
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:38,227
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,813
But you musn't fib to me,
you know.

296
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:43,816
Oh, no, I love Jesus and Moses
and all of them...

297
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:49,113
There's quite a difference.

298
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:55,827
Moses was a Hebrew,
but Jesus was a gentile,

299
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,954
like you and me.

300
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,499
Aren't you done
washing that boy yet?

301
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,544
I'm giving the child important
religious instruction, Silas.

302
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:05,837
I want to eat!

303
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:11,134
Looks like a pretty well-growed
child, if you ask me.

304
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:14,346
All right now, dear,

305
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:20,893
please stand up
and let me dry you off.

306
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:25,856
I shall avert my eyes,
of course.

307
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:30,194
Fine... now step
out of the tub...

308
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:32,238
and...

309
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:42,747
Actually, you are
rather well grown, Jack.

310
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:47,002
You're small but...
nice-Iooking.

311
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:49,546
Did you know that?

312
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:52,048
No, ma'am.

313
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,216
Well, you are.

314
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:56,636
All the more reason
for you to receive

315
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,514
complete religious
instruction.

316
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:03,393
The girls, I'm sure,
will all be after you.

317
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:04,561
And Jack...

318
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,271
Ma'am?

319
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:10,107
That way lies madness.

320
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,692
What way, ma'am?

321
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:20,868
You, you'll understand these
things better when you're older.

322
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,495
The point is, my dear boy

323
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:28,751
that we all
must resist temptation.

324
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:34,672
Purity is its own reward.

325
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,885
Dear Jack.

326
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,740
Welcome to your new home.

327
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,828
Now dress...

328
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,374
and come in to supper.

329
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,586
I went to school
and learned all over

330
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,214
how to read and write
and cipher.

331
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,300
It was strange at first,
but Mrs. Pendrake tutored me,

332
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,302
and I learned fast.

333
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,471
But there was one thing I didn't
know nothing about,

334
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,557
and that was a thing called sin.

335
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,185
Aha! I caught you
at the gates of hell!

336
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,186
Boy!

337
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,312
The hand of God

338
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,899
must smite the carcass of man!

339
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,321
It's worth it, dear, Jack.

340
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:47,367
It's worth it a million times
over to be pure and good.

341
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:50,870
To walk in the paths
of righteousness.

342
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:53,623
There's no happiness like it.

343
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:55,959
Do you believe me, Jack?

344
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:57,627
Do you believe me?

345
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:59,004
Yes, ma'am.

346
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:00,338
I sure do.

347
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:03,383
Amazing grace, how sweet...

348
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:06,845
So it was I entered
my religion period.

349
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:09,723
I was a great
little hymn singer.

350
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:12,391
And I wasn't fooling, neither.

351
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,809
I'd been saved!

352
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:16,895
I baptize you in the name
of the Father and the Son

353
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:18,188
and the Holy Spirit!

354
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,732
Oh, Lord, look down upon

355
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:21,692
this poor boy who lived
among the heathen,

356
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:24,194
and cleanse him
of the corruption

357
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,197
of their foul and pagan ways.

358
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,658
And make him white
again as the snow.

359
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,077
Let him be reborn
and repurified

360
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:33,162
in Thy name.

361
00:30:33,203 --> 00:30:34,371
I baptize you

362
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:35,539
in the name of the Father

363
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:37,999
and the Son
and the Holy Spirit!

364
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,042
Amen.

365
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:43,296
Mrs. Pendrake was right
about temptation.

366
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:45,006
Jack...

367
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:46,341
I wasn't having nothing

368
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,426
to do with them Jezebels.

369
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:51,888
I told her all about my triumph
over temptation,

370
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,767
and we read the Bible
for about an hour, to celebrate.

371
00:30:57,393 --> 00:31:02,064
As the weeks went by,
I fell more and more

372
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:04,066
in love with Mrs. Pendrake.

373
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:06,693
Spiritually, of course.

374
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,403
Well...

375
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:10,656
I shall be off on
my Wednesday shopping.

376
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:12,157
The boy's doing so poor
these days,

377
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,992
why don't you
take him along and air him?

378
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:18,580
He'd be bored with shopping.

379
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:19,581
No, I wouldn't, ma'am.

380
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:24,169
All right, then,
you come with me, Jack.

381
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:33,469
Good morning, Mr. Kane.

382
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:35,346
Ma'am.

383
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,640
This is Jack,

384
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,558
my adopted son.

385
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,147
What's your pleasure, ma'am?

386
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:47,984
Well, let's see...

387
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:54,572
I think I shall have
a sassafras flip.

388
00:31:58,326 --> 00:32:00,370
How about you, buster?

389
00:32:00,412 --> 00:32:02,247
Huh?

390
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,416
Oh, yeah, I'll have the same.

391
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:18,178
Never mind for me, Mr. Kane.

392
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:19,888
I must be off
with my shopping.

393
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,016
It would bore you terribly,
Jack, dear.

394
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:23,851
You stay here
and have some cake.

395
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:25,978
I'll take care of him,
Mrs. Pendrake.

396
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,649
Thank you very much,
I'm sure, Mr. Kane.

397
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:55,131
That soda shop was something.

398
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,468
Especially that
elephant-head spigot.

399
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,305
I was playing with it,
and enjoying myself,

400
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,599
then, all of a sudden,
an awful feeling

401
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:07,893
run through me.

402
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,394
Where had that fellow gone to?

403
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:19,071
Don't...

404
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:21,198
Don't...

405
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,075
No, don't...

406
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:24,576
Oh, yeah...

407
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:26,161
No, don't!

408
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,372
You beast...

409
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,539
Do-Don't...

410
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:32,708
Pagan beast! Oh!

411
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,876
Help!

412
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:38,297
Oh, oh, you devil!

413
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:42,385
You filthy, dirty devil!

414
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,429
Heathen!

415
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,514
Yes! No!

416
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:47,723
Ye... Ye... Ye...

417
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:49,058
Oh! Yeah, yeah...

418
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,060
Yeah, yeah...

419
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:52,019
No... Help!

420
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:53,270
Help! Help! I'm dying...

421
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:56,481
She was calling him a devil
and moaning for help,

422
00:33:56,523 --> 00:34:00,068
but I didn't get no idea
she wanted to be rescued.

423
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:11,121
That was the end
of my religion period.

424
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:15,917
I ain't sung a hymn
in 104 years.

425
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:19,671
After starving awhile,
I took up with a swindler.

426
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:22,172
Name of
Allardyce T. Meriweather.

427
00:34:22,214 --> 00:34:23,674
After Mrs. Pendrake,

428
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:26,427
his honesty was
downright refreshing.

429
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:28,304
At no cost to you,
it is my mission

430
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,306
to pass on to you
Dead Man's Potion...

431
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:35,894
Meriweather was one of the
smartest men I ever knowed.

432
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:36,937
But he tended

433
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:40,107
to lose parts of himself.

434
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:43,193
When I joined him,
his left hand and his left ear

435
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:45,069
were already gone.

436
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:46,696
...might be able
to see a miracle,

437
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:49,449
one I have witnessed
many times before.

438
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,868
The power of this
elixir has been proven

439
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,786
to reverse men's ills...

440
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,498
It'll cure your sores and...

441
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,876
During my years with
Meriweather,

442
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,711
he lost an eye as a result

443
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:04,422
of a fifth ace
dropping out of his sleeve

444
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:05,840
in a poker game.

445
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,134
It didn't faze him, though.

446
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,802
Deception was his life's blood,

447
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,763
even if it caused him

448
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:16,642
to get whittled down
kind of gradual-like.

449
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:18,185
Thank you.

450
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,478
You're improving, Jack.

451
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,271
You just can't seem to get rid

452
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:23,190
of that streak of honesty
in you.

453
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:27,194
The one that ruined you was
that damned Indian, old Tepee.

454
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:29,071
You mean Old Lodge Skins.

455
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:33,033
He gave you a vision
of moral order in the universe,

456
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:34,617
and there isn't any.

457
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:38,829
Those stars twinkle
in a void, there, boy,

458
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:42,833
and the two-legged creature
schemes and dreams beneath them,

459
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:47,171
all in vain.

460
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,298
All in vain, Jack.

461
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,633
You hear anything?

462
00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:51,759
Listen to me!

463
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,262
Two-legged creature
will believe anything,

464
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:57,598
and the more preposterous,
the better.

465
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,851
Whales speak French
at the bottom of the sea.

466
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,438
The horses of Arabia
have silver wings.

467
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,484
Pygmies mate with elephants
in darkest Africa.

468
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:10,485
I have sold

469
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:13,238
all those propositions.

470
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:26,250
Or maybe we're all fools,
and none of it matters.

471
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:29,336
Ah.

472
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,851
You stay
with Allardyce Meriweather,

473
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:46,103
and you'll wear silk.

474
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,815
But I don't know as
I want to wear silk.

475
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,777
My dear boy, what else

476
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,904
can a man of parts wear
than silk?

477
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:58,615
Tar and feathers,

478
00:36:58,656 --> 00:37:00,533
I reckon!

479
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:01,868
All right.

480
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:03,161
Sit right there.

481
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:04,996
Don't make no moves

482
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:07,749
unless you want a little
daylight in your liver.

483
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,376
What, may I ask, brings you out

484
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:13,171
into the wilds
at this hour, sir?

485
00:37:13,212 --> 00:37:15,047
- Is them the ones?
- That's them.

486
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:17,924
I see'd this young 'un
somewhere before.

487
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,968
I never been in this country.

488
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,095
You look mighty familiar, bub.

489
00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:26,975
Oh! Sir!

490
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:30,270
What's you got in there?

491
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:31,438
Lye?

492
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,231
Well, sir, now you can hardly
expect me

493
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:35,025
to reveal its constituents.

494
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,401
Sir, please, you're... you know

495
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:38,320
you're-you're wasting
precious medicine.

496
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:39,737
Seven folks are half dead

497
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,364
because of this
precious medicine.

498
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,531
What's in it?

499
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,201
Why, nothing harmful,
I assure you.

500
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:46,077
What?!

501
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:48,120
Mostly water.

502
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,750
Whiskey, a little pepper,

503
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,835
oil of cloves, um, um...

504
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:57,755
...ginger root...

505
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,839
Whew!

506
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:04,260
Ugh, what's that?

507
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,721
What's what?

508
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,475
Oh, that.

509
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:13,186
It's a dozen snake heads

510
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:15,188
to give it strength.

511
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,732
All right, boys!

512
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:21,611
Let's burn them feathers.

513
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:23,947
Yee-ha!

514
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:30,995
Got caught, Jack, that's all.

515
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:34,415
Life contains a particle
of risk.

516
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:37,251
Mr. Meriweather, you don't know
when you're licked.

517
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:38,419
Licked?

518
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,045
I'm not licked.

519
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:43,215
I'm tarred and feathered,
that's all.

520
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,218
All right, boys.

521
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,012
I reckon
they've been run enough.

522
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:58,563
I know I see'd you somewhere.

523
00:38:58,605 --> 00:38:59,606
What's your name, son?

524
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,651
Jack Crabb.

525
00:39:03,693 --> 00:39:06,029
Lord above!

526
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,280
I've tarred

527
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,907
and feathered my own brother!

528
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,913
It's wonderful, Jack.

529
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:18,040
I can give you something

530
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:19,708
you never had before.

531
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,084
And something

532
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,878
I never had before neither.

533
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,714
A real...

534
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,341
family life.

535
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:28,508
Yeah.

536
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,767
You are back in the bosom
of your family, Jack.

537
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,730
Okay,

538
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:43,397
now you.

539
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,649
Caroline, I mean, I don't...

540
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,733
I don't know anything
about guns.

541
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:47,026
I mean,
I never even carried none.

542
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,694
Oh,

543
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,906
Lord, what kind of upbringing
did them Injuns give you?

544
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:54,075
Never carried no gun?

545
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:58,162
Why, a man ain't complete
without a gun.

546
00:39:58,204 --> 00:39:59,538
Go snake-eyed.

547
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:00,748
Do what?

548
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:04,251
Like this...

549
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:07,546
Like this!

550
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:14,552
All right.

551
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:17,389
Now, draw and shoot

552
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,473
that bottle,

553
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,517
before you touch the gun.

554
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:23,353
But Caroline, how can
I draw and shoot the gun

555
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:25,355
before I touch it?

556
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:27,232
Concentrate. Try it.

557
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:39,660
Oh!

558
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:42,413
Hot damn!

559
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:43,789
Yeah.

560
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:45,582
Caroline was right.

561
00:40:45,624 --> 00:40:49,712
It is possible to shoot a gun
before you touch it.

562
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:54,091
Of course,
it takes lightning reflexes,

563
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:58,344
and considerable
snake-eyed concentration.

564
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,814
Throw up three.

565
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,486
Why, Hickok hisself
can't hit three.

566
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:17,989
Throw up three.

567
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:40,260
Natural born gunfighter.

568
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:46,974
So it was
I entered my gunfighter period.

569
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:21,299
You're crowding me.

570
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:25,762
Oh, Kid... I didn't
s-see you; I'm sorry.

571
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:28,306
It's stupid of me
to take up all the room.

572
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:29,683
I was just talking here.

573
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:30,892
Set me up with a sody-pop.

574
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:32,060
Yes, sir.

575
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:33,853
Right away, Kid.

576
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:37,982
The Soda Pop Kid,
that's what they called me.

577
00:42:41,694 --> 00:42:42,736
Sody-pop, he wants.

578
00:43:00,963 --> 00:43:03,673
Anything wrong with that,
stranger?

579
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:05,592
Oh, not a thing, friend.

580
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,010
In fact, I admire

581
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,428
the style of it.

582
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:11,139
Might I ask
who I are addressing?

583
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,849
I'm Wild Bill Hickok.

584
00:43:17,312 --> 00:43:19,355
Well, I'm...

585
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,611
I'm pleased to meet you,
I'm sure.

586
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:26,862
The pleasure's mutual, friend.

587
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:29,531
Bring your soda pop over here
and sit for a while.

588
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:20,914
I can break three bottles
throwed in the air.

589
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:26,252
That's shootin'.

590
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:36,972
How many men have you...

591
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:39,015
gunned down?

592
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:44,770
I don't rightly recollect.

593
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:46,355
How many have you?

594
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:50,359
Oh, about...

595
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,403
two dozen.

596
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:57,074
Is that a fact?

597
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:59,410
No, it wasn't a fact at all.

598
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:04,331
During my gunfighter period,
I was an awful liar.

599
00:45:04,331 --> 00:45:07,959
I wouldn't have estimated
your total that high.

600
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,919
No offense intended, old Hoss,

601
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:13,464
but you don't have the look
of murder in your eye.

602
00:45:13,506 --> 00:45:15,967
Like, for example,
that buzzard over there.

603
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:17,010
Him?

604
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:20,680
Well, he's just a common drunk.

605
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:46,246
What you so nervous about?

606
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,542
Gettin' shot.

607
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:54,671
I got a full house!

608
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,005
I got a...

609
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:57,256
I got a full house.

610
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:00,551
Now you got me doing it.

611
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,972
Sorry.

612
00:46:05,014 --> 00:46:07,058
Hold the fort a while,
old horse,

613
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,643
while I get another bottle.

614
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:35,252
Did you know the man, Bill?

615
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,212
Never saw the gent before.

616
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:43,635
Mr. Hickok,
that man is really dead.

617
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,928
Got him through the lungs
and heart both.

618
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,772
Selling your gunfighter outfit.

619
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,440
Turning in

620
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,693
your gun.

621
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,819
Well, I'm sorry, Caroline...

622
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:06,282
There ain't nothin'
in this world more useless

623
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,285
than a gunfighter
who can't shoot people.

624
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,125
Men!

625
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:17,875
Hyah-ha!

626
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:25,383
There went the bosom
of my family.

627
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:30,555
Having tried religion,
the snake oil business,

628
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,558
and gunfightin', without
no great amount of success,

629
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,475
I took me a partner,

630
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:37,019
become a respectable
storekeeper,

631
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,187
and married Olga,

632
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:42,357
a Swedish girl who couldn't
hardly speak no English.

633
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:44,901
Preserve the moment.

634
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:46,278
Yes.

635
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:55,954
Olga, shall I carry you
over the threshold?

636
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:57,247
Ja.

637
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:02,793
It-it... it's a custom.

638
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:04,295
Ja.

639
00:48:19,435 --> 00:48:20,937
Well, it ain't much now, Olga,

640
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:25,482
but me and my partner,
we got... we got big plans.

641
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:30,153
Free enterprise
and honest sweat.

642
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:36,660
Ja. Ja.

643
00:48:47,045 --> 00:48:49,130
I don't understand
this bill of lading.

644
00:48:49,172 --> 00:48:50,923
It looks like
I'm being charged twice

645
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:52,383
for the same goods.

646
00:48:52,424 --> 00:48:55,219
Ja, the bills of the store.

647
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:57,263
It must be
a bookkeeping error.

648
00:48:57,304 --> 00:48:59,223
Honest Jack Applebaum
wouldn't do that to me.

649
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:01,809
Ja, enough the bills.

650
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:03,143
Come and get some rest.

651
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:07,523
I must be making the mistake.

652
00:49:07,564 --> 00:49:09,066
Ja!

653
00:49:09,108 --> 00:49:11,986
The rest. The body.
You needs it.

654
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:14,946
Yeah.

655
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:17,031
Maybe I do.

656
00:49:38,886 --> 00:49:40,387
Rest!

657
00:50:22,178 --> 00:50:25,264
Olga... Olga, come on.

658
00:50:25,306 --> 00:50:27,183
We'll get out of this
somehow.

659
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,976
One little thing about
my new business partner...

660
00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:31,436
he was a thief.

661
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:35,607
...25 cents for this
musical instrument.

662
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:37,108
This glorious
musical instrument

663
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,819
this glorious musical instrument
that I present to you now.

664
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:40,820
I want you to take a look

665
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:42,322
at this beautiful
musical instrument.

666
00:50:42,364 --> 00:50:44,866
Who will take this beautiful
instrument? Who will take it?

667
00:50:46,952 --> 00:50:48,286
That is a pathetic scene.

668
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:49,746
Yes, sir.

669
00:50:49,788 --> 00:50:51,331
A ruined and desolate family

670
00:50:51,373 --> 00:50:54,166
wiped out
by economic misfortune.

671
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,960
- I find it touching.
- Yes, sir.

672
00:50:56,001 --> 00:51:00,089
I'll never forget
the first time I set eyes

673
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:05,469
on General
George Armstrong Custer.

674
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:07,680
Ruined! That what we is, Jack!

675
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:09,473
Ruined!

676
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,227
Do you have another trade,
my good man?

677
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:16,981
Well, General, I...
not exactly.

678
00:51:17,022 --> 00:51:20,400
Then take my advice: Go west.

679
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:23,945
West! Oh! Oh!

680
00:51:24,028 --> 00:51:26,239
My wife, she... she's
awful scared of Indians.

681
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:28,199
My dear woman,
you have nothing to fear

682
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:30,159
from the Indians;
I give you

683
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:31,327
my personal guarantee.

684
00:51:36,332 --> 00:51:39,127
Olga! Olga!

685
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,547
Hit him! Hit him!

686
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:43,797
Sorry, brother.

687
00:51:56,518 --> 00:51:57,978
I think we're going to get away!

688
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:09,196
Let me at the savages!

689
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:10,531
I got a gun!
Let me at 'em!

690
00:52:10,573 --> 00:52:11,741
Let me at 'em!
Let me at 'em!

691
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:12,783
I got a gun here!

692
00:52:12,867 --> 00:52:14,911
We must be civilized!

693
00:52:14,952 --> 00:52:17,204
Hey! Hey!

694
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:19,081
"And it came to pass,
after the plague,

695
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,626
"that the Lord stayed,
and then He said..."

696
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:32,720
Grab the reins!
Grab the reins!

697
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:33,511
Shoot him!

698
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:37,766
Give me... give me
that shotgun!

699
00:52:37,807 --> 00:52:40,352
No, it's mine!

700
00:54:12,274 --> 00:54:14,108
Get back in! Get back!

701
00:54:17,194 --> 00:54:19,530
I'll protect you!

702
00:54:33,294 --> 00:54:34,086
Olga!

703
00:54:36,297 --> 00:54:37,797
Olga!

704
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:40,008
Ow!

705
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,011
Olga...

706
00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:52,312
I covered most of three states
and hundreds of square miles

707
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:56,233
looking for Olga,
with no luck at all.

708
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,235
Hey, Crabb!

709
00:54:58,235 --> 00:54:59,361
Whiskey...

710
00:54:59,402 --> 00:55:00,528
Crabb!

711
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,529
Whiskey...
Whiskey...

712
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:02,780
For a drink of whiskey,

713
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,823
they'll give you
one of their squaws.

714
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:05,824
Whiskey...

715
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:06,992
Sure save you
a lot of looking.

716
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:18,087
Whiskey...

717
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,839
I looked everywhere for my wife

718
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:22,841
but couldn't find her.

719
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:27,345
Finally, I had to go
deeper into Cheyenne country.

720
00:55:27,387 --> 00:55:31,933
I didn't figure
for me it was dangerous...

721
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:34,852
speaking Cheyenne and having
once been a Human Being myself.

722
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,111
Let's kill him.

723
00:55:43,152 --> 00:55:44,696
I didn't steal
your father's ponies, brother.

724
00:55:44,737 --> 00:55:46,239
Why do you keep calling me
brother?

725
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:48,408
I want you to stop doing that.

726
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:49,784
I am not your brother.

727
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:51,035
I am a Human Being.

728
00:55:51,077 --> 00:55:53,412
I suppose you will say
you have never heard

729
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:54,413
of Little Big Man.

730
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,877
Little Big Man was my brother,

731
00:56:00,919 --> 00:56:02,629
but you're not him.

732
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:05,257
He fought beside me
in battle and was killed

733
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:07,301
after rubbing out
many bluecoats.

734
00:56:07,342 --> 00:56:08,594
Did you see the body?

735
00:56:10,345 --> 00:56:13,473
No, he turned into a swallow
and flew away.

736
00:56:13,515 --> 00:56:14,600
Let's kill him and go home.

737
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:15,392
Shadow!

738
00:56:15,434 --> 00:56:16,143
You were shot there.

739
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:17,810
I picked you up

740
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:18,936
and put you on a pony.

741
00:56:18,978 --> 00:56:20,229
I saved you.

742
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:21,981
Dirt on the Nose.

743
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:24,108
Do you still have the black pony

744
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,484
I gave you
up at the Powder River?

745
00:56:25,526 --> 00:56:27,486
No, the Pawnee stole him,

746
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:31,616
when we camp at the Old
Women Butte, five snows ago.

747
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:44,628
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.

748
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:52,427
There is a pain between my ears.

749
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:24,583
My son.

750
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:28,837
To see you again causes my heart
to soar like a hawk.

751
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,339
Sit here

752
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:32,048
beside me.

753
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,025
Grandfather, I brought you

754
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,027
this present.

755
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,572
Is this the hat I used to own,

756
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:58,490
except grown softer of skin

757
00:57:58,532 --> 00:57:59,866
and fatter?

758
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:02,536
No, Grandfather, it's another.

759
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:12,337
We must smoke to your return.

760
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:23,389
I saw you in a dream.

761
00:58:23,431 --> 00:58:26,100
You were drinking from a spring

762
00:58:26,142 --> 00:58:29,812
that came from the long nose
of an animal.

763
00:58:29,896 --> 00:58:32,773
I did not recognize the animal.

764
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:37,570
Alongside his nose,
he grew two horns,

765
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:44,911
and the water that gushed
from his nose was full of air.

766
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,082
I can't explain it,

767
00:58:51,124 --> 00:58:54,961
but he was talking about
that elephant-head spigot

768
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:57,380
in the soda shop.

769
00:58:57,422 --> 00:59:00,759
And this wasn't the only time
Old Lodge Skins had dreams

770
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,887
that turned out true.

771
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:05,388
Don't be angry,

772
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:06,598
my son,

773
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,935
with Burns Red, Shadow,
and the others.

774
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:14,688
They had many a bad experience
with the white man last year.

775
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:19,193
I have thought and talked
and smoked on this matter

776
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:22,905
and my decision is...

777
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:26,283
Little Big Man has returned.

778
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:33,791
It was quite a homecoming.

779
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,542
Little Big Man.

780
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:39,337
It was Little Horse,

781
00:59:39,337 --> 00:59:44,801
the boy who didn't want
to fight the Pawnee.

782
00:59:49,347 --> 00:59:50,932
Don't you remember me?

783
00:59:52,684 --> 00:59:55,812
This hurts me in my heart.

784
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:59,482
I think I'll cry.

785
00:59:59,524 --> 01:00:01,316
He'd become a Heemanah,

786
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:04,486
for which there ain't
no English word.

787
01:00:04,528 --> 01:00:06,363
And he was a good one, too.

788
01:00:06,405 --> 01:00:09,199
The Human Beings
thought a lot of him.

789
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:36,058
Hello, Younger Bear.

790
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,560
Good-bye.

791
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:40,354
It was the boy
whose life I had saved,

792
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:42,356
to his mortal embarrassment.

793
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:46,861
Did you catch rabbits
on your hunting trip?

794
01:00:46,903 --> 01:00:48,070
No.

795
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:49,196
Then don't give the rabbits

796
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:50,530
you didn't catch

797
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:51,990
to Buffalo Wallow Woman.

798
01:00:52,032 --> 01:00:53,575
You see,
Younger Bear had become

799
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:58,955
a Contrary, the most dangerous
of all Cheyenne warriors

800
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,292
because the way they live
drives them half crazy.

801
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:03,877
Except for battle,

802
01:01:04,002 --> 01:01:06,588
a Contrary
does everything backwards.

803
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,507
He says good-bye
when he means hello,

804
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:12,844
yes when he means no,
walks through bushes

805
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:15,638
instead of on trails,
and washes with dirt,

806
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:17,890
and dries with water
and so forth.

807
01:01:17,932 --> 01:01:19,558
I thought you were dead.

808
01:01:23,103 --> 01:01:24,688
Why have you come back

809
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,441
when nobody
wants to see you?

810
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,944
You mustn't speak
to Little Big Man like that.

811
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:31,278
You owe him a life.

812
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:37,785
I'm glad I said it. Hello.

813
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:39,619
That was supposed to mean

814
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:41,829
he was sorry he said it,
good-bye.

815
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:47,126
But that warrior wasn't sorry.
He hated me still.

816
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:50,046
Grandfather,

817
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:52,382
I have a white wife.

818
01:01:52,423 --> 01:01:54,759
You do?

819
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:57,637
That's interesting.

820
01:01:57,637 --> 01:02:01,641
Does she cook
and does she work hard?

821
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:03,351
Oh, yes, Grandfather.

822
01:02:03,393 --> 01:02:05,769
That surprises me.

823
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:10,232
Does she show pleasant
enthusiasm when you mount her?

824
01:02:11,984 --> 01:02:14,570
Well, sure, Grandfather.

825
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:17,239
That surprises me even more.

826
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:18,865
I tried one of them once

827
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:24,162
but she didn't show
any enthusiasm at all.

828
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:34,255
Well, Grandfather,
all the whites aren't crazy.

829
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:39,135
I'm glad to hear that, my son.

830
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:41,512
I thought they were.

831
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:42,513
Oh, no.

832
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:50,187
I know of one who is
as brave as any Human Being.

833
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:53,816
I'd like to meet this man
and smoke with him.

834
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:55,567
What is he called?

835
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:58,445
He's called General Custer.

836
01:02:58,486 --> 01:03:01,573
General Custer.

837
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:05,035
What does the name mean, my son?

838
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:08,747
Well, it, it means...

839
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:10,624
long hair.

840
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,834
Good name.

841
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,544
How did he win it?

842
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:16,796
He won it in the war

843
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:20,758
of the whites
to free the black men.

844
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,719
Oh, yes.

845
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,555
The black white man.

846
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:28,807
I know of them.

847
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:33,729
It is said a black white man
once became a Human Being.

848
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:36,649
But mostly they are
strange creatures.

849
01:03:39,193 --> 01:03:46,407
Not as ugly as the white, true,
but they're just as crazy.

850
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,170
Don't worry, my son.

851
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:01,256
You'll return
to the Human Beings.

852
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:03,258
I dreamed it last night.

853
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,635
I saw you and your wives

854
01:04:05,677 --> 01:04:07,971
as you crawled
from one to the other

855
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:09,471
in your tepee.

856
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,390
Wives, Grandfather?

857
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,599
Oh, yes.

858
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,893
Three or four.

859
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,229
It was dark

860
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,565
and they were hidden
under buffalo robes.

861
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:20,899
But it was

862
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,068
a great copulation, my son.

863
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:28,907
Grandfather,
the Human Beings

864
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,742
only take one wife.

865
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,244
How could I have three or four?

866
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:35,913
I don't know.

867
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,416
It worries me.

868
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:04,441
I was sure
I'd never see him again.

869
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:06,610
Sir, I expect being a scout

870
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:09,696
is the best way for me
to find my wife, General.

871
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,324
She was captured by the Cheyenne
due to our going west,

872
01:05:12,365 --> 01:05:13,950
just like you advised.

873
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,869
I advised? That's impossible.

874
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:17,829
I've never set eyes
on you before.

875
01:05:17,871 --> 01:05:20,498
Oh, I wouldn't figure
you'd remember me, sir.

876
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,876
Furthermore, you don't
look like a scout to me.

877
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:24,460
Not a bit.

878
01:05:24,501 --> 01:05:26,754
A scout has
a certain appearance.

879
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:28,881
Kit Carson, for example.

880
01:05:29,006 --> 01:05:30,799
But you don't have it.

881
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:31,842
You look like...

882
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:33,552
a mule skinner.

883
01:05:33,594 --> 01:05:35,012
Well, I don't know

884
01:05:35,012 --> 01:05:36,722
anything about
mules, sir.

885
01:05:36,764 --> 01:05:37,848
It's a remarkable thing,

886
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,600
but I can tell
the occupation of a man

887
01:05:39,642 --> 01:05:40,809
merely by looking at him.

888
01:05:40,851 --> 01:05:41,852
Notice the bandy legs.

889
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:42,895
Hmm?

890
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:44,313
Strong arms.

891
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:47,650
This man has spent years
with mules.

892
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:50,318
Isn't that correct?

893
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,486
Well, I...

894
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:54,489
Yes, sir.

895
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:57,575
Hire the mule skinner!

896
01:05:57,617 --> 01:05:59,077
Yes, sir.

897
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,041
Over here.

898
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,251
Come on.

899
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:09,629
Did you just hear what he said?

900
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:10,964
Supposed to hire you.

901
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:14,550
I wouldn't want
no wife of mine back

902
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:16,218
after she'd been
with the Injuns.

903
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,845
Kindest thing,
a bullet in the brain.

904
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:21,139
Well, I don't agree.

905
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:23,183
And I want my wife back.

906
01:06:23,225 --> 01:06:25,227
Well...

907
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:27,563
one of the Pawnee located

908
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:29,273
a band of the vermin

909
01:06:29,314 --> 01:06:31,358
camped down the river.

910
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,151
We ride in the morning!

911
01:06:35,153 --> 01:06:37,697
Is-Is there, is there
any white women with them?

912
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:55,131
Now my advice to you

913
01:06:55,172 --> 01:06:57,216
is to get yourself
a little revenge

914
01:06:57,258 --> 01:06:58,801
on them bucks.

915
01:07:01,095 --> 01:07:02,430
All right.

916
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:04,055
Spare the females and children,

917
01:07:04,097 --> 01:07:05,056
if possible.

918
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:06,558
Let's go.

919
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,581
No!

920
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:34,251
Hey!

921
01:07:34,293 --> 01:07:35,002
No!

922
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:36,629
Hey!

923
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,258
He said spare the women
and children!

924
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,593
Give me that!

925
01:07:42,635 --> 01:07:43,761
Let go of my rifle!

926
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:44,845
The hell I will.

927
01:07:55,647 --> 01:07:56,856
You've killed
the women and babies!

928
01:07:56,898 --> 01:07:58,733
You bastard!
You son of a bitch!

929
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,151
Let go of my horse!

930
01:08:00,193 --> 01:08:01,319
Call 'em back, sir!

931
01:08:02,487 --> 01:08:04,948
You'll hang for this!

932
01:08:39,565 --> 01:08:41,983
It was downright discouraging.

933
01:08:42,024 --> 01:08:44,986
If it wasn't the Indians
trying to kill me for a white,

934
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:49,240
it was the whites trying
to kill me for an Indian.

935
01:08:52,368 --> 01:08:54,412
It made me sick.

936
01:08:54,453 --> 01:08:56,956
The Pawnee scouts
and soldiers both

937
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,208
was killing
everything in sight.

938
01:09:12,888 --> 01:09:13,680
Shadow!

939
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:15,515
Brother, let's talk.

940
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,458
You'll be took care of later.

941
01:09:42,499 --> 01:09:45,252
I'm saving you for the hanging.

942
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:49,381
There's no describing
how I felt.

943
01:09:49,423 --> 01:09:52,343
An enemy had saved my life
by the violent murder

944
01:09:52,384 --> 01:09:55,554
of one of my best friends.

945
01:09:55,596 --> 01:10:00,558
The world was too ridiculous
even to bother to live in.

946
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:42,349
That was why Shadow was there,

947
01:10:42,391 --> 01:10:44,768
and that was why
he'd fought so hard.

948
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,728
I sat there
and watched that baby

949
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,439
come into this world.

950
01:10:53,317 --> 01:10:56,988
Except for her breathing,
that woman never made a sound.

951
01:10:57,071 --> 01:10:58,447
If woman she was.

952
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:02,785
She didn't look
more than a girl.

953
01:11:18,681 --> 01:11:21,684
I couldn't take my eyes

954
01:11:21,684 --> 01:11:24,602
off of that girl and her baby.

955
01:11:28,106 --> 01:11:30,358
All right,
let's get the hell out.

956
01:11:30,358 --> 01:11:31,608
Let the Pawnee clean up.

957
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,527
Bugler, assemble our troop!

958
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:37,156
Listen to me.

959
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:43,161
If you are kin to Shadow...
then you know of Little Big Man.

960
01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:47,123
I was a friend
of the Human Beings

961
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:50,417
until they stole my wife.

962
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,589
Are you Shadow's wife?

963
01:11:58,174 --> 01:12:01,010
His daughter?

964
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,807
Where is your husband?

965
01:12:07,849 --> 01:12:10,727
Killed.

966
01:12:17,691 --> 01:12:20,027
What's your name?

967
01:12:20,027 --> 01:12:22,070
Sunshine.

968
01:12:22,153 --> 01:12:25,656
I'm going to
take you with me...

969
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:27,408
and trade you

970
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,534
for my wife.

971
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:38,334
Clear them bushes, Younger.

972
01:12:44,673 --> 01:12:46,925
Move on. Nobody here.

973
01:12:46,966 --> 01:12:49,803
Let's get the hell out.

974
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:28,712
Wait here, woman.

975
01:13:33,425 --> 01:13:34,926
Hello, Grandfather.

976
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:39,471
Greetings, my son.

977
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:41,932
Do you want to eat?

978
01:13:50,106 --> 01:13:51,566
Grandfather?

979
01:13:51,607 --> 01:13:55,861
What happened to your neck,
Grandfather?

980
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:57,654
It's a wound.

981
01:13:57,696 --> 01:13:59,072
It cut the tunnel

982
01:13:59,114 --> 01:14:01,365
through which light travels
to the heart.

983
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:09,706
You... you mean you're blind?

984
01:14:09,748 --> 01:14:11,624
Oh, no.

985
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:14,836
My eyes still see.

986
01:14:14,878 --> 01:14:18,047
But my heart no longer
receives it.

987
01:14:21,967 --> 01:14:24,428
How did it happen?

988
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,471
White man.

989
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:32,602
Where's Buffalo Wallow Woman?

990
01:14:32,643 --> 01:14:34,811
Rubbed out.

991
01:14:34,853 --> 01:14:37,814
And White Elk Woman, too.

992
01:14:37,856 --> 01:14:40,150
And Dirt on the Nose.

993
01:14:40,192 --> 01:14:41,360
And High Wolf.

994
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:43,277
And many others.

995
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:44,987
And Burns Red?

996
01:14:46,322 --> 01:14:47,573
Yes.

997
01:14:49,408 --> 01:14:51,159
Burns Red in the Sun?

998
01:14:51,201 --> 01:14:54,204
Rubbed out.

999
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:58,208
His wife... his children...

1000
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,834
and many more.

1001
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,920
Do you hate them?

1002
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,296
Do you hate

1003
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,507
the white man now?

1004
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:15,556
Do you see this fine thing?

1005
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:19,142
Do you admire
the humanity of it?

1006
01:15:19,184 --> 01:15:22,229
Because the Human Beings,
my son,

1007
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:25,314
they believe
everything is alive.

1008
01:15:25,356 --> 01:15:30,820
Not only man and animals,

1009
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:33,029
but also water, earth, stone,

1010
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:39,202
and also the things from them,
like that hair.

1011
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:42,871
The man
from whom this hair came,

1012
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,458
he's bald on the other side

1013
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,794
because I now own his scalp.

1014
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:55,758
That is the way things are.

1015
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,345
But the white men,

1016
01:16:00,387 --> 01:16:04,516
they believe
everything is dead:

1017
01:16:04,558 --> 01:16:07,143
Stone, earth, animals,

1018
01:16:07,184 --> 01:16:08,853
and people.

1019
01:16:08,894 --> 01:16:11,939
Even their own people.

1020
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:18,236
If things keep trying to live,
white man will rub them out.

1021
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:24,700
That is the difference.

1022
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:40,922
You will stay with us...

1023
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:42,966
my son.

1024
01:16:56,019 --> 01:17:00,774
A year later,
I was still with 'em.

1025
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:04,360
After wandering all over,
in constant danger

1026
01:17:04,401 --> 01:17:08,697
of being killed by white
settlers or white soldiers,

1027
01:17:08,739 --> 01:17:13,785
we come to a place
knowed as the Indian Nations.

1028
01:17:13,826 --> 01:17:18,206
It was a tract of land
by the Washita River

1029
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:23,085
that had been gived forever
to the Indians by the Congress

1030
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:26,421
and the President
of the United States.

1031
01:17:26,463 --> 01:17:30,049
We was safe there.

1032
01:17:30,091 --> 01:17:34,845
This was Indian land.

1033
01:17:34,887 --> 01:17:38,848
As long as grass growed
and wind blow

1034
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,769
and the sky is blue.

1035
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:49,900
Your new son's
kicking a lot today.

1036
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:52,069
I think he wants to come out
and see his father.

1037
01:17:54,112 --> 01:17:58,783
Tell him to wait
until I finish my dinner.

1038
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:01,661
I'll tell him, but I don't think
he's going to wait much longer.

1039
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,835
It's a good thing
I have a strong, brave husband

1040
01:18:10,876 --> 01:18:12,420
who brings in so much

1041
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:13,963
game and food.

1042
01:18:13,963 --> 01:18:16,549
Mm-hmm.

1043
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:17,800
My strong husband

1044
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:19,968
brings in much more
than we need.

1045
01:18:38,026 --> 01:18:39,485
There are many
Human Beings here.

1046
01:18:39,527 --> 01:18:40,862
Many bands

1047
01:18:40,903 --> 01:18:42,405
from many places.

1048
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:44,990
But it's sad.

1049
01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:47,034
Many husbands
have been rubbed out

1050
01:18:47,075 --> 01:18:48,160
by the white man.

1051
01:18:49,494 --> 01:18:51,330
It is sad because women

1052
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,705
sleep alone and cry.

1053
01:18:52,747 --> 01:18:54,081
Be quiet now.

1054
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:56,625
I'm digesting.

1055
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:07,010
Yes, but I think
my sisters are here.

1056
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:09,136
Your what?!

1057
01:19:11,555 --> 01:19:13,432
My sisters.

1058
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:14,641
Digging Bear, Little Elk

1059
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:15,809
and Corn Woman.

1060
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,226
I think they're here.

1061
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,687
What do you mean,
you think they're here?

1062
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,230
I believe they are.

1063
01:19:21,272 --> 01:19:22,398
You bring in

1064
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,858
much more food than we need.

1065
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:26,568
It is very sad.

1066
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,528
They have no husbands

1067
01:19:28,528 --> 01:19:29,780
and they cry.

1068
01:19:29,821 --> 01:19:31,698
Well, that's too bad;
I'm sorry.

1069
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,325
Digging Bear had a baby
and lost it.

1070
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:36,494
And so did Corn Woman.

1071
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:38,537
But Little Elk
had no baby at all.

1072
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:40,748
All right, what do you want me
to do about it?

1073
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:44,250
I knew you'd understand.

1074
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:08,230
It was Old Lodge Skins' dream
trying to come true.

1075
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:26,246
I was determined to stay out
of them buffalo robes.

1076
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:29,416
Three young and healthy women

1077
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:33,794
with no man
for who knows how long. Mmm.

1078
01:20:33,836 --> 01:20:37,214
The very idea kind of shrunk me

1079
01:20:37,256 --> 01:20:40,217
like a spider on a hot stove.

1080
01:20:40,259 --> 01:20:42,385
Why, it's Little Big Man!

1081
01:20:42,427 --> 01:20:45,763
Oh, Little Big Man!

1082
01:20:47,015 --> 01:20:50,308
Younger Bear,
it's Little Big Man!

1083
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,396
He's not a Contrary anymore.

1084
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:55,731
He has a wife.

1085
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:01,569
She's plump, she works hard,
but she henpecks him.

1086
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,238
Just when I think you are dead,
and the buzzards have eaten you,

1087
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,613
you always come back.

1088
01:21:05,655 --> 01:21:08,491
Yes, and I always will
till you pay me

1089
01:21:08,533 --> 01:21:10,285
the life you owe me.

1090
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:13,579
I've heard you.

1091
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:20,419
Now, come to my tepee

1092
01:21:20,461 --> 01:21:22,295
and eat.

1093
01:21:22,337 --> 01:21:25,048
We was caught
in Cheyenne hospitality.

1094
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,675
I'm a very important man.

1095
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,302
More important than you.

1096
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:33,513
I have a wife
and four horses.

1097
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:38,060
I have a horse
and... four wives.

1098
01:21:39,977 --> 01:21:42,480
Well, that may be.

1099
01:21:42,521 --> 01:21:47,984
But... my wife,
she's a very good one.

1100
01:21:47,984 --> 01:21:49,152
See?

1101
01:21:53,573 --> 01:21:54,866
Oh, so

1102
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:57,368
there you are,
you crawling coyote.

1103
01:21:57,409 --> 01:21:58,619
What are we going to eat, huh?

1104
01:21:58,661 --> 01:21:59,703
This starved duck?

1105
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:05,625
Oh...

1106
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:07,168
Oh, who's the foolish beggar

1107
01:22:07,168 --> 01:22:09,796
you brought to steal
what little food we have?

1108
01:22:09,837 --> 01:22:12,172
Clean it, clean it!

1109
01:22:12,172 --> 01:22:13,507
Ooh!

1110
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:16,051
It was Olga.

1111
01:22:16,093 --> 01:22:18,387
I had found her at last.

1112
01:22:18,428 --> 01:22:20,388
One duck.

1113
01:22:20,429 --> 01:22:22,348
Olga never did learn
much English

1114
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,684
but she sure in hell
had learned Cheyenne.

1115
01:22:24,684 --> 01:22:28,478
I, I, I just
don't understand it.

1116
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,481
Usually, this woman is...

1117
01:22:31,523 --> 01:22:33,650
gentle as a dove.

1118
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,198
My words were not the words

1119
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,992
to speak to a stranger.

1120
01:22:43,033 --> 01:22:44,660
You stay and eat.

1121
01:22:48,871 --> 01:22:51,207
You see what a good wife she is?

1122
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:53,875
It's because
I'm a wonderful lover.

1123
01:22:53,917 --> 01:22:55,502
Go in my tepee.

1124
01:22:55,544 --> 01:22:56,920
She will cook this duck for you.

1125
01:22:56,962 --> 01:22:58,839
That's all right;
I'm not hungry.

1126
01:23:03,259 --> 01:23:05,594
You've humiliated him again.

1127
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:12,684
Good-bye, Younger Bear.

1128
01:23:17,063 --> 01:23:19,315
You look tired, Little Big Man.

1129
01:23:19,356 --> 01:23:21,817
Do you want
to come into my tepee

1130
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:25,696
and rest on soft furs?

1131
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:29,073
Why don't you live with me,
and I'll be your wife?

1132
01:23:29,115 --> 01:23:32,076
Thank you for inviting me.

1133
01:23:34,995 --> 01:23:39,333
Well, I've got to fix my hair
to sing tonight.

1134
01:23:39,374 --> 01:23:42,753
Good-bye, Little Big Man.

1135
01:23:42,753 --> 01:23:45,755
Good-bye, Little Horse.

1136
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:51,093
And so I finally found Olga.

1137
01:23:51,135 --> 01:23:54,846
I'd lost her long ago
to the Human Beings,

1138
01:23:54,846 --> 01:24:00,142
and I saw no good reason
to reveal myself to her now.

1139
01:24:02,394 --> 01:24:03,479
Grandfather!

1140
01:24:05,522 --> 01:24:07,858
Why have you moved your tepee
so far from our band?

1141
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,485
The ponies are trying
to tell me something.

1142
01:24:17,449 --> 01:24:20,035
Last night I had a dream.

1143
01:24:20,118 --> 01:24:22,746
The ponies were dying.

1144
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:25,873
I heard them scream.

1145
01:24:28,334 --> 01:24:31,921
I'd learned to respect
Old Lodge Skins' dreams,

1146
01:24:31,963 --> 01:24:34,923
but for once,
we were in a safe place,

1147
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:36,800
give to us by a treaty.

1148
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,117
Why do you hate my sisters?

1149
01:25:07,076 --> 01:25:10,246
I don't hate your sisters, I...

1150
01:25:10,288 --> 01:25:13,582
It... it's just that...

1151
01:25:13,624 --> 01:25:15,583
the Great Spirit...

1152
01:25:17,627 --> 01:25:20,964
tells me...

1153
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:25,009
Where are you going?

1154
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:28,304
Your son won't wait any longer.

1155
01:25:28,345 --> 01:25:30,597
He wants to come out
and see his father.

1156
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:40,939
Sunshine, Indian style,
was going off to have her baby.

1157
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:47,696
As I watched her walk away,
it come over me

1158
01:25:47,738 --> 01:25:54,285
that the Great Spirit wanted me
to go in that tepee.

1159
01:26:18,181 --> 01:26:20,516
Who wants to be first?

1160
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:34,445
Who's this here?

1161
01:26:34,487 --> 01:26:35,655
It's me.

1162
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:39,824
Well, I...

1163
01:26:39,866 --> 01:26:42,494
guess you'll do as well as any.

1164
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:45,038
I figured
she was the littlest one,

1165
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:48,040
and it would be easy.

1166
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:53,170
But Lord help us,
them young girls is deadly.

1167
01:26:54,796 --> 01:26:58,841
However, the Great Spirit
was with me...

1168
01:26:58,883 --> 01:27:00,802
and I survived.

1169
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,097
Only thing was,

1170
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:08,558
just as I was about
to drift off real peaceful...

1171
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,902
No, you stay.

1172
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,112
Not yet.

1173
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:24,114
Maybe I can get back later.

1174
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:27,367
Idle boasting, I assure you.

1175
01:27:29,952 --> 01:27:31,120
Who's this here?

1176
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:35,416
It's me, Digging Bear.

1177
01:27:43,298 --> 01:27:46,925
Well, she wasn't called
Digging Bear for nothing,

1178
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:48,927
I can tell you that.

1179
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:03,315
Stay here.

1180
01:28:03,356 --> 01:28:05,400
Corn Woman's too tired.

1181
01:28:05,442 --> 01:28:06,568
Oh.

1182
01:28:09,362 --> 01:28:12,615
She don't sound tired to me.

1183
01:28:12,656 --> 01:28:13,824
That's not her.

1184
01:28:13,866 --> 01:28:15,326
That's Little Elk.

1185
01:28:15,367 --> 01:28:16,994
That's both of them.

1186
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:18,578
Little Elk, you go on to sleep.

1187
01:28:19,871 --> 01:28:22,123
You, too.

1188
01:28:22,123 --> 01:28:24,334
Digging Bear!

1189
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,716
Corn Woman, where are you?

1190
01:28:37,678 --> 01:28:42,141
I was lucky
I come across her last.

1191
01:28:58,322 --> 01:29:00,490
The others, too?

1192
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:04,118
Yes.

1193
01:29:13,001 --> 01:29:15,170
I knew you were a good man.

1194
01:29:22,927 --> 01:29:25,011
Here's your new son.

1195
01:29:32,394 --> 01:29:34,853
I reckon right then

1196
01:29:34,853 --> 01:29:37,898
I come pretty close
to turning pure Indian,

1197
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:41,651
and I probably would have spent
the rest of my days

1198
01:29:41,693 --> 01:29:44,028
with Sunshine and her sisters.

1199
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:48,658
But sometimes grass don't grow,
wind don't blow...

1200
01:29:50,575 --> 01:29:52,369
...and the sky ain't blue.

1201
01:29:53,412 --> 01:29:54,997
Something's wrong
with the ponies.

1202
01:29:55,122 --> 01:29:56,999
Wolves.

1203
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,708
Grandfather's d... Here!

1204
01:29:58,749 --> 01:29:59,917
Go inside.

1205
01:29:59,959 --> 01:30:03,296
Don't leave the tepee.

1206
01:30:19,226 --> 01:30:21,687
Grandfather,
what's wrong with the ponies?

1207
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,688
Don't you hear that, my son?

1208
01:31:45,594 --> 01:31:48,096
I wonder why I didn't see them
in my dream.

1209
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:51,099
Sunshine!

1210
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:53,393
Sunshine!

1211
01:32:13,618 --> 01:32:16,997
Grandfather,
you've got to get inside.

1212
01:32:17,038 --> 01:32:18,915
Why bother, son?

1213
01:32:18,957 --> 01:32:20,040
It's a good day to die.

1214
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:29,173
We've got to get
to the riverbank!

1215
01:32:32,844 --> 01:32:33,469
I am blind.

1216
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:34,846
I cannot fight.

1217
01:32:36,305 --> 01:32:38,181
But I won't run.

1218
01:32:38,223 --> 01:32:39,016
If it's

1219
01:32:39,057 --> 01:32:40,017
my day to die,

1220
01:32:40,058 --> 01:32:41,935
I want to do it here
within a circle.

1221
01:32:44,186 --> 01:32:46,272
Grandfather...

1222
01:32:46,314 --> 01:32:50,818
the river is part
of the great circle

1223
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:53,612
of the waters of the Earth.

1224
01:32:53,653 --> 01:32:55,071
That's true,

1225
01:32:55,113 --> 01:32:56,489
but the soldiers would kill us

1226
01:32:56,531 --> 01:32:57,991
before we could get
to the river.

1227
01:32:58,033 --> 01:33:01,452
The sol...? Grandfather,
you didn't see any soldiers

1228
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,163
in your dream,
and-and that means that...

1229
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:06,165
that they can't see you now.

1230
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,208
You think so?

1231
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,542
Yes, yes.

1232
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,044
What else did your dream mean?

1233
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,462
I think you're right.

1234
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:15,006
Then let's go to the great
circle of the river!

1235
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:16,549
Invisible.

1236
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,884
I never been invisible before.

1237
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:22,512
It's too late.

1238
01:33:22,554 --> 01:33:23,680
We're cut off.

1239
01:33:23,722 --> 01:33:24,765
It doesn't matter.

1240
01:33:24,806 --> 01:33:26,307
We're invisible.

1241
01:33:26,349 --> 01:33:28,726
Grandfather, wait!

1242
01:33:33,898 --> 01:33:34,689
Grandfather!

1243
01:33:41,154 --> 01:33:42,947
I know it sounds ridiculous

1244
01:33:42,988 --> 01:33:47,076
but them soldiers never
lifted a hand to stop us.

1245
01:33:47,201 --> 01:33:50,079
I reckon it was so crazy,
they couldn't figure it out.

1246
01:33:50,204 --> 01:33:51,955
Or maybe they thought

1247
01:33:51,996 --> 01:33:54,916
we was prisoners
or even friendlies

1248
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:56,834
since Old Lodge Skins
was grinning at them

1249
01:33:56,876 --> 01:33:58,503
like a raccoon.

1250
01:34:05,634 --> 01:34:09,929
Or maybe
we really was invisible.

1251
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:11,973
All I knowed is we walked

1252
01:34:12,014 --> 01:34:14,559
right through 'em to the river.

1253
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:45,627
Circle the camp!
Circle the camp, boys!

1254
01:34:46,878 --> 01:34:48,463
That was extremely enjoyable.

1255
01:34:48,505 --> 01:34:49,630
Glad you liked it

1256
01:34:49,672 --> 01:34:50,715
Grandfather.

1257
01:34:53,718 --> 01:34:55,887
Captain!

1258
01:34:59,598 --> 01:35:00,974
Captain...

1259
01:35:01,975 --> 01:35:03,643
...shoot the Indian ponies.

1260
01:35:03,685 --> 01:35:05,145
I beg your pardon, sir?

1261
01:35:05,145 --> 01:35:06,395
That is my decision.

1262
01:35:06,437 --> 01:35:08,606
- I shall shoot the ponies.
- But, sir!

1263
01:35:08,647 --> 01:35:10,316
- Sunshine...
- Go and do it!

1264
01:35:10,316 --> 01:35:11,317
Yes, sir.

1265
01:35:15,153 --> 01:35:17,614
Young man,
your self-righteous piety

1266
01:35:17,655 --> 01:35:19,490
is commencing to annoy me.

1267
01:35:19,532 --> 01:35:21,826
But l-I didn't
say anything, sir.

1268
01:35:21,868 --> 01:35:24,411
You think it's shocking
to shoot a few ponies?

1269
01:35:24,453 --> 01:35:25,871
Well, let me tell you,

1270
01:35:25,913 --> 01:35:28,832
the women are far more important
than the ponies.

1271
01:35:28,874 --> 01:35:30,958
The point is,
they breed like rats,

1272
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,669
however, Lieutenant,
this is a legal action.

1273
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:38,007
And the men are under strict
orders not to shoot the women.

1274
01:35:38,049 --> 01:35:41,509
Unless, of course,
they refuse to surrender.

1275
01:35:44,095 --> 01:35:45,180
Isn't that correct?!

1276
01:35:45,222 --> 01:35:46,306
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

1277
01:36:40,019 --> 01:36:41,688
Sunshine!

1278
01:36:43,106 --> 01:36:45,275
Run! Run!

1279
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:51,321
Run!

1280
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:53,739
No!

1281
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:55,741
No!

1282
01:38:02,217 --> 01:38:03,676
Where you going, soldier?

1283
01:38:03,718 --> 01:38:05,511
Message for the General.

1284
01:38:05,553 --> 01:38:06,596
Wait a minute.

1285
01:38:06,638 --> 01:38:08,931
What's that on your face?

1286
01:38:09,014 --> 01:38:11,183
Oh, mud, sir.

1287
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:12,184
That's not mud,
that's Indian paint.

1288
01:38:15,562 --> 01:38:17,355
And that's an Indian knife.

1289
01:38:17,396 --> 01:38:19,524
What's your company?

1290
01:38:19,565 --> 01:38:21,025
My company, sir?

1291
01:38:21,067 --> 01:38:23,569
Yes, and the name of
your commanding officer.

1292
01:38:23,611 --> 01:38:24,987
What's the trouble, Captain?

1293
01:38:25,029 --> 01:38:26,863
I think we've got

1294
01:38:26,905 --> 01:38:28,240
a renegade, General.

1295
01:38:28,281 --> 01:38:29,366
He's wearing Indian paint

1296
01:38:29,407 --> 01:38:30,909
and he doesn't know
his commanding officer

1297
01:38:30,951 --> 01:38:32,035
or his company.

1298
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,286
Take him away and hang him.

1299
01:38:34,328 --> 01:38:35,412
General!

1300
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:38,249
General, don't you remember me?

1301
01:38:39,375 --> 01:38:40,960
I'm Jack Crabb,
the mule skinner!

1302
01:38:41,001 --> 01:38:43,419
Mule skinner?

1303
01:38:43,461 --> 01:38:44,420
Yes, sir!

1304
01:38:44,462 --> 01:38:46,589
I applied for a job as scout,

1305
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:47,632
but you could tell

1306
01:38:47,674 --> 01:38:49,717
my true occupation
just by looking at me.

1307
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:55,305
Yes, yes, I believe
I do remember that.

1308
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,058
How did you become a renegade?

1309
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,812
General...
I ain't no renegade!

1310
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:06,440
I was captured by the Cheyenne
and held prisoner!

1311
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:10,318
Why, they...
they took cactus thorns

1312
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,695
and stuck them in me!

1313
01:39:11,736 --> 01:39:12,863
But I just laughed

1314
01:39:12,904 --> 01:39:14,364
and begged them

1315
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:16,824
to keep on doing it!

1316
01:39:16,866 --> 01:39:19,243
You... laughed?

1317
01:39:19,285 --> 01:39:20,578
I laughed my head off!

1318
01:39:20,619 --> 01:39:22,413
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

1319
01:39:28,209 --> 01:39:32,337
Gentlemen, it is difficult
to admit to an error.

1320
01:39:32,379 --> 01:39:33,672
Captain?

1321
01:39:40,177 --> 01:39:42,680
Captain, your summary judgment

1322
01:39:42,722 --> 01:39:44,432
was wholly mistaken!

1323
01:39:44,473 --> 01:39:46,684
Now aren't you glad I saw fit

1324
01:39:46,726 --> 01:39:49,227
to question this
man more closely?

1325
01:39:49,269 --> 01:39:50,270
Yes, sir.

1326
01:39:52,898 --> 01:39:56,359
Please be more careful
in the future, Captain.

1327
01:41:08,798 --> 01:41:10,591
I'll drink the tea now,
Corporal.

1328
01:41:10,633 --> 01:41:11,716
Yes, sir.

1329
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:24,520
What are you doing
up here, mule skinner?

1330
01:41:24,562 --> 01:41:29,649
Nothing, I...
just brought you tea, General.

1331
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:41,660
And I wanted to...
thank you again

1332
01:41:41,702 --> 01:41:44,413
for sparing my life.

1333
01:41:48,332 --> 01:41:52,378
Why are you standing
to the side?

1334
01:41:54,045 --> 01:41:55,839
Turn this way.

1335
01:42:21,904 --> 01:42:27,867
You came up here
to kill me, didn't you?

1336
01:42:28,993 --> 01:42:30,828
And you lost your nerve.

1337
01:42:34,707 --> 01:42:37,667
Well, I was correct, in a sense.

1338
01:42:37,709 --> 01:42:39,252
You are a renegade,

1339
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:42,506
but you are no Cheyenne brave.

1340
01:42:44,006 --> 01:42:46,217
Custer was right.

1341
01:42:46,258 --> 01:42:50,763
I was a total failure
as an Indian.

1342
01:42:50,804 --> 01:42:53,765
Do I hang you?

1343
01:42:53,806 --> 01:42:54,933
I think not.

1344
01:42:54,974 --> 01:42:56,643
Get out of here.

1345
01:42:59,895 --> 01:43:02,064
You're not going to hang me?

1346
01:43:02,105 --> 01:43:04,691
Your miserable life
is not worth

1347
01:43:04,733 --> 01:43:07,611
the reversal
of a Custer decision.

1348
01:43:12,073 --> 01:43:17,160
That was the worst thing
he could have done to me.

1349
01:43:22,499 --> 01:43:25,960
There was nothing left
of my self-respect at all.

1350
01:43:31,799 --> 01:43:34,467
I couldn't go back
to the Indians

1351
01:43:34,509 --> 01:43:38,721
so I went back among
the whites and become a drunk.

1352
01:43:47,646 --> 01:43:51,065
Boy, you're a sad sight, Hoss.

1353
01:43:51,149 --> 01:43:53,359
You should have stuck
to sody-pop.

1354
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:03,118
How are things with you, Bill?

1355
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,119
Fine.

1356
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,996
I've changed my ways, Hoss.

1357
01:44:06,121 --> 01:44:08,706
That's good.

1358
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,001
Say, Bill,

1359
01:44:12,084 --> 01:44:15,128
I need a drink worse than
a breath of life itself.

1360
01:44:17,547 --> 01:44:19,257
- Here's $20.
- Oh!

1361
01:44:19,299 --> 01:44:21,718
Get gloriously drunk.

1362
01:44:21,759 --> 01:44:24,678
But first, go across
the street to the barber,

1363
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,556
and have yourself a bath,
and buy some clothes.

1364
01:44:27,598 --> 01:44:29,016
Then come see me in the saloon.

1365
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:32,935
One thing I do know, Hoss,

1366
01:44:32,977 --> 01:44:35,855
any damn fool
can drink himself to death.

1367
01:44:43,737 --> 01:44:45,530
Come on. Come on!

1368
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:10,344
Bill, I want to...

1369
01:45:10,385 --> 01:45:12,262
Hoss, I'd like to ask you
a confidential favor.

1370
01:45:12,304 --> 01:45:16,307
It's a delicate matter
involving a-a widow.

1371
01:45:24,064 --> 01:45:27,526
She needs a train ticket
out of town.

1372
01:45:27,567 --> 01:45:29,402
You give her this.

1373
01:45:29,527 --> 01:45:30,361
Sure, Bill.

1374
01:45:30,402 --> 01:45:32,363
See, my new, beautiful wife

1375
01:45:32,404 --> 01:45:34,532
is violently jealous,

1376
01:45:34,573 --> 01:45:39,327
and... and this widow,
oh, she's quite a widow.

1377
01:45:39,369 --> 01:45:42,539
I think I know
what you mean, Bill.

1378
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:43,581
Her name was Lulu Kane.

1379
01:45:43,623 --> 01:45:44,999
Right now, Bill.

1380
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:47,000
Good.

1381
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,520
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1382
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:09,563
Get out of the way!

1383
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:10,564
Bill! Bill...

1384
01:46:10,605 --> 01:46:12,148
He killed my daddy!

1385
01:46:12,189 --> 01:46:14,775
He killed my daddy!
He killed my daddy!

1386
01:46:14,817 --> 01:46:16,735
He's never gonna shoot
nobody again!

1387
01:46:16,735 --> 01:46:17,611
Took me seven years

1388
01:46:17,653 --> 01:46:18,863
to get him, but I got him!

1389
01:46:31,582 --> 01:46:33,250
Who was he anyhow?

1390
01:46:33,292 --> 01:46:35,085
Some boy.

1391
01:46:38,838 --> 01:46:41,966
Hoss...

1392
01:46:43,092 --> 01:46:46,553
...you know that matter
we discussed?

1393
01:46:46,595 --> 01:46:47,637
The widow?

1394
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,097
Yes, Bill.

1395
01:46:49,139 --> 01:46:53,225
Don't tell my wife.

1396
01:46:53,267 --> 01:46:56,520
That'd really get me in trouble.

1397
01:47:09,157 --> 01:47:15,245
You've got me down
in this goldang water!

1398
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,920
Come in, stranger.

1399
01:47:23,961 --> 01:47:25,171
Whatever it is you want,

1400
01:47:25,213 --> 01:47:27,839
we've got it.

1401
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:32,844
Miss Pendrake?

1402
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:47,190
You've mistaken me
for someone else, stranger.

1403
01:47:47,232 --> 01:47:50,026
My name is Lulu.

1404
01:47:52,611 --> 01:47:53,737
Your name ain't Lulu.

1405
01:47:53,779 --> 01:47:55,531
You're Louise Pendrake.

1406
01:47:59,742 --> 01:48:01,410
Who-who are you?

1407
01:48:01,452 --> 01:48:04,956
Well, I am Jack Crabb.

1408
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,960
Miss Pendrake,
don't you remember me?

1409
01:48:10,001 --> 01:48:13,588
Jack Crabb?

1410
01:48:16,632 --> 01:48:18,259
My God.

1411
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:26,850
Jack.

1412
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:28,184
Well, this is quite

1413
01:48:28,226 --> 01:48:29,853
a pleasant surprise.

1414
01:48:29,894 --> 01:48:33,147
Th-this room
is more commodious.

1415
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:36,441
And now, wh-what have you
been doing with yourself?

1416
01:48:36,483 --> 01:48:38,110
Lulu! What the hell
are you doing in here

1417
01:48:38,152 --> 01:48:39,820
sitting on your ass?

1418
01:48:39,862 --> 01:48:41,696
There's a
gentleman waiting.

1419
01:48:41,737 --> 01:48:43,823
I have a gentleman
in here, too.

1420
01:48:43,865 --> 01:48:46,451
Oh, I didn't see you, stranger.

1421
01:48:46,492 --> 01:48:47,493
Is everything
all right?

1422
01:48:47,535 --> 01:48:49,162
- Oh, everything's fine.
- Need anything?

1423
01:48:49,203 --> 01:48:50,203
If you do, just ring the bell.

1424
01:48:50,245 --> 01:48:51,788
Our motto here is

1425
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:54,291
"Whatever you want,
we've got it."

1426
01:49:02,965 --> 01:49:04,633
Well, Jack.

1427
01:49:04,675 --> 01:49:06,217
Now you know.

1428
01:49:07,385 --> 01:49:14,475
This is a house of ill fame,
and I'm a fallen flower.

1429
01:49:14,516 --> 01:49:17,853
That widow hadn't lost
her style one bit.

1430
01:49:17,895 --> 01:49:20,314
"A fallen flower."

1431
01:49:20,355 --> 01:49:22,899
Chokes me up to think about it.

1432
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:27,487
This life is not only wicked
and sinful,

1433
01:49:27,528 --> 01:49:30,656
it isn't even any fun.

1434
01:49:30,698 --> 01:49:33,950
No, I reckon, I reckon not,
Miss Pendrake.

1435
01:49:33,992 --> 01:49:35,285
If I was married

1436
01:49:35,327 --> 01:49:38,246
and could come here
once or twice a week,

1437
01:49:38,288 --> 01:49:39,914
well, it might be fun.

1438
01:49:39,955 --> 01:49:43,375
But every night?
It's just boring.

1439
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:46,337
Oh, I can understand that.

1440
01:49:47,379 --> 01:49:49,714
I can't seem to save any money.

1441
01:49:49,756 --> 01:49:52,592
Well, if I could just
save a few dollars

1442
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:54,010
I could go to visit

1443
01:49:54,052 --> 01:49:57,221
my-my maiden aunt in Washington.

1444
01:49:57,262 --> 01:50:01,183
New clothes, a carriage.

1445
01:50:01,225 --> 01:50:03,894
And who knows,
I might even marry a senator.

1446
01:50:03,936 --> 01:50:07,647
Oh! You'd make a good wife
for a senator

1447
01:50:07,688 --> 01:50:09,190
Miss Pendrake.

1448
01:50:09,232 --> 01:50:13,193
You always were a sweet boy.

1449
01:50:18,073 --> 01:50:20,033
Do you know,

1450
01:50:20,075 --> 01:50:23,536
I often had wicked thoughts
about you?

1451
01:50:23,577 --> 01:50:24,578
Huh?

1452
01:50:24,578 --> 01:50:26,038
Oh, yes.

1453
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,040
Several times.

1454
01:50:28,082 --> 01:50:32,168
I almost gave in to temptation.

1455
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:35,380
And now... here we are.

1456
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:43,720
Miss Pendrake,
what are you doing?

1457
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:47,557
Do you know that once
I tiptoed into your room,

1458
01:50:47,598 --> 01:50:51,436
and stood over you
for the longest time?

1459
01:50:51,436 --> 01:50:55,772
It was the most awful
temptation to wake you up.

1460
01:50:58,275 --> 01:51:01,236
I wish that I had.

1461
01:51:01,278 --> 01:51:05,781
It would have been
deliciously wicked.

1462
01:51:07,241 --> 01:51:09,743
Is anything
the matter, Jack?

1463
01:51:09,785 --> 01:51:11,244
No.

1464
01:51:11,286 --> 01:51:14,497
Then I'll wait for you in the...

1465
01:51:14,539 --> 01:51:17,167
place of retirement.

1466
01:51:37,225 --> 01:51:39,895
You should have
woke me up that night

1467
01:51:39,895 --> 01:51:41,897
years ago, Miss Pendrake.

1468
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:48,569
This is from Wild Bill.

1469
01:51:48,611 --> 01:51:50,070
It was his last wish

1470
01:51:50,154 --> 01:51:52,697
that you go to Washington
and live with your maiden aunt.

1471
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:56,993
His last wish

1472
01:51:57,035 --> 01:52:00,371
was to save me?

1473
01:52:04,082 --> 01:52:05,709
Oh, Jack.

1474
01:52:05,793 --> 01:52:09,128
I must honor that wish.

1475
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:11,589
You can do it, Miss Pendrake.

1476
01:52:11,631 --> 01:52:13,716
Yes, I can...

1477
01:52:13,758 --> 01:52:16,552
and I will.

1478
01:52:16,594 --> 01:52:17,886
I got to go now.

1479
01:52:18,929 --> 01:52:20,555
Good-bye, Miss Pendrake.

1480
01:52:20,597 --> 01:52:22,224
Oh, good-bye, Jack.

1481
01:52:22,265 --> 01:52:26,227
And thank you ever so much.

1482
01:52:26,268 --> 01:52:27,728
Oh, and Jack...

1483
01:52:30,981 --> 01:52:32,233
...if you're ever

1484
01:52:32,274 --> 01:52:38,238
in Washington, do look me up.

1485
01:52:49,123 --> 01:52:50,623
How are things with you,

1486
01:52:50,665 --> 01:52:51,958
Mr. Meriweather?

1487
01:52:51,958 --> 01:52:53,126
Splendid.

1488
01:52:57,713 --> 01:52:58,964
Well, now, look at that.

1489
01:52:58,964 --> 01:53:00,132
Buffalo hides.

1490
01:53:00,173 --> 01:53:01,591
There's a world of money

1491
01:53:01,633 --> 01:53:03,760
chewing grass
on those plains, Jack.

1492
01:53:03,844 --> 01:53:09,348
There goes
Buffalo Bill himself.

1493
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:10,850
Oh...

1494
01:53:10,891 --> 01:53:12,435
Yes, sir.

1495
01:53:12,476 --> 01:53:14,145
Multiply that by thousands.

1496
01:53:14,186 --> 01:53:16,980
Little Jack, the buffalo
is getting scarce.

1497
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:18,231
You were raised by Indians.

1498
01:53:18,273 --> 01:53:19,774
You should
know how to track them.

1499
01:53:19,858 --> 01:53:21,276
Yeah, but...

1500
01:53:21,317 --> 01:53:22,861
We could make a killing, Jack.

1501
01:53:34,996 --> 01:53:36,956
Haven't changed a bit, Jack.

1502
01:53:36,998 --> 01:53:38,624
Neither have you.

1503
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:40,792
You'd better watch out,
Mr. Meriweather.

1504
01:53:40,834 --> 01:53:43,003
They're whittlin' you down
pretty serious.

1505
01:53:43,003 --> 01:53:46,006
You can't afford to lose
any more of your parts.

1506
01:53:46,131 --> 01:53:49,717
Every business
has a particle of risk.

1507
01:53:49,759 --> 01:53:52,136
Bye, dear boy.

1508
01:54:02,562 --> 01:54:04,481
That was my low.

1509
01:54:04,522 --> 01:54:06,356
I had reached the bottom.

1510
01:54:12,696 --> 01:54:14,906
I'd become a hermit.

1511
01:54:14,947 --> 01:54:19,077
I went deep in the wilderness,
as far away as I could get.

1512
01:54:37,218 --> 01:54:38,552
Then one day,

1513
01:54:38,552 --> 01:54:42,889
I found something
trappers see fairly regular.

1514
01:54:42,931 --> 01:54:47,643
An animal had gnawed off
its own foot

1515
01:54:47,684 --> 01:54:50,687
to escape from the trap.

1516
01:54:54,733 --> 01:54:56,275
Something snapped in my head.

1517
01:54:56,317 --> 01:55:02,156
I decided
life wasn't fit to live

1518
01:55:02,198 --> 01:55:03,865
and the only thing to do

1519
01:55:03,907 --> 01:55:06,743
was to mingle
with the twinkling stars.

1520
01:55:14,208 --> 01:55:17,711
Good-bye, Jack.

1521
01:55:17,753 --> 01:55:20,880
Good-bye, Little Big Man.

1522
01:55:20,922 --> 01:55:21,881
At that moment,

1523
01:55:21,965 --> 01:55:24,426
I really was crazy

1524
01:55:24,467 --> 01:55:27,929
and I was darn near
off that cliff when...

1525
01:55:52,743 --> 01:55:58,247
The time had come
to look the devil in the eye

1526
01:55:58,289 --> 01:56:01,542
and send him to hell
where he belonged.

1527
01:56:02,876 --> 01:56:04,627
The only question was,

1528
01:56:04,627 --> 01:56:07,172
how to get him there?

1529
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:13,302
Sergeant, take this man...

1530
01:56:15,804 --> 01:56:18,098
...and give him some clothes.

1531
01:56:24,312 --> 01:56:27,147
This man will be invaluable
to me, Major.

1532
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:29,066
Invaluable, sir?

1533
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:31,985
I almost hanged that man
as a renegade.

1534
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:34,863
Now, he asks me for a job
as a scout.

1535
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:36,822
Oh, his game

1536
01:56:36,822 --> 01:56:39,700
is very obvious... to lead me
away from his Indian friends.

1537
01:56:39,742 --> 01:56:43,703
I still don't quite
follow you, General.

1538
01:56:46,164 --> 01:56:49,542
Anything that man tells me
will be a lie.

1539
01:56:49,584 --> 01:56:53,587
Therefore, he will be
a perfect reverse barometer.

1540
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:00,176
Isn't that correct?

1541
01:57:00,218 --> 01:57:01,677
Of course, General.

1542
01:57:14,689 --> 01:57:17,691
Move them out, men. Ho!

1543
01:57:31,955 --> 01:57:34,748
In my belief,
Custer's hate for the Indians

1544
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:38,335
and his ambition
had combined on him.

1545
01:57:38,377 --> 01:57:42,296
He figured he needed one more

1546
01:57:42,338 --> 01:57:44,549
dramatic victory
over the Indians

1547
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:47,969
to be nominated for
President of the United States.

1548
01:57:48,052 --> 01:57:50,554
That is a true historical fact.

1549
01:57:50,595 --> 01:57:52,723
Men, hold!

1550
01:57:52,764 --> 01:57:54,558
We will take brief refreshment.
Water only!

1551
01:57:54,558 --> 01:57:56,309
Dismount!

1552
01:57:56,351 --> 01:57:58,894
Water break!

1553
01:58:09,237 --> 01:58:10,864
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.

1554
01:58:10,905 --> 01:58:13,908
It's the celibacy of the saddle.

1555
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:15,409
I had muscle spasms all night.

1556
01:58:17,995 --> 01:58:19,872
The poison from the goo-nads.

1557
01:58:19,913 --> 01:58:21,373
Poison from the what, sir?

1558
01:58:22,666 --> 01:58:26,377
Goo-nads.
That's medical terminology.

1559
01:58:26,419 --> 01:58:27,754
General, it's my duty as your...

1560
01:58:35,052 --> 01:58:36,928
The poison rises
from the goo-nads

1561
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:40,056
to the throat and then seeps
down to various muscles.

1562
01:58:40,097 --> 01:58:42,641
General...

1563
01:58:42,683 --> 01:58:43,851
the Crows want to know

1564
01:58:43,893 --> 01:58:46,520
if you're going down
in the Medicine Tail Coulee.

1565
01:58:46,562 --> 01:58:48,646
Oh, they do, do they?

1566
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:50,273
Yes, sir, they do.

1567
01:58:50,315 --> 01:58:53,109
They claim they want time
to sing their death song.

1568
01:58:53,151 --> 01:58:56,570
Tell the Crows they're women!

1569
01:58:56,612 --> 01:58:59,531
But, sir...

1570
01:58:59,573 --> 01:59:01,450
if the hostiles
come in behind us,

1571
01:59:01,492 --> 01:59:04,495
and if they're
waiting for us down below,

1572
01:59:04,536 --> 01:59:05,787
we'll never get out of there.

1573
01:59:05,828 --> 01:59:07,830
Hostiles behind us?

1574
01:59:07,872 --> 01:59:09,415
I see no hostiles behind us.

1575
01:59:09,457 --> 01:59:11,250
Do you see any hostiles
behind us, Major?

1576
01:59:11,292 --> 01:59:12,335
No, sir, not at the moment...

1577
01:59:12,377 --> 01:59:13,668
Then, then, then...

1578
01:59:14,628 --> 01:59:16,296
...stop trying to cause

1579
01:59:16,338 --> 01:59:18,715
a reversal
of a Custer decision.

1580
01:59:18,757 --> 01:59:22,301
But, sir, wouldn't it...
wouldn't it be best

1581
01:59:22,343 --> 01:59:24,387
to send a squad down
Medicine Tail Coulee?

1582
01:59:24,428 --> 01:59:25,638
No, it wouldn't.

1583
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,139
But, sir...

1584
01:59:27,181 --> 01:59:30,850
may I ask, sir, why it wouldn't?

1585
01:59:30,892 --> 01:59:34,562
Because Major, it would cost us
the vital element of surprise.

1586
01:59:34,604 --> 01:59:37,732
Surprise? General,
they know we're here.

1587
01:59:37,774 --> 01:59:38,982
Yes, but they don't know

1588
01:59:39,108 --> 01:59:41,485
that I intend to attack them
without mercy.

1589
01:59:41,527 --> 01:59:43,987
But, General,
that's no surprise.

1590
01:59:44,113 --> 01:59:45,114
Of course it is.

1591
01:59:45,155 --> 01:59:46,989
Nothing is this world
is more surprising

1592
01:59:47,031 --> 01:59:48,491
than the attack without mercy.

1593
01:59:50,201 --> 01:59:51,369
General...

1594
01:59:51,369 --> 01:59:55,706
General, I must protest
this impetuous decision.

1595
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:05,756
A Custer decision, impetuous?

1596
02:00:05,798 --> 02:00:10,136
Grant called me impetuous, too!

1597
02:00:10,177 --> 02:00:11,678
The drunkard.

1598
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:13,513
Sitting there
in the White House,

1599
02:00:13,555 --> 02:00:15,765
calling me impetuous!

1600
02:00:15,807 --> 02:00:20,185
General, General,
I implore you to reconsider.

1601
02:00:20,185 --> 02:00:24,857
Think of the men
whose lives depend upon you.

1602
02:00:34,615 --> 02:00:38,243
What do you think
I should do, mule skinner?

1603
02:00:38,285 --> 02:00:40,203
Sir, that man
doesn't know anything.

1604
02:00:42,039 --> 02:00:44,832
What do you say, mule skinner?

1605
02:00:44,874 --> 02:00:49,962
Should I go down there
or withdraw?

1606
02:00:50,004 --> 02:00:53,673
I had him.

1607
02:00:53,715 --> 02:00:55,258
But this time

1608
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,011
what I held in my hand
wasn't a knife

1609
02:00:58,053 --> 02:00:59,846
but the truth.

1610
02:00:59,888 --> 02:01:01,722
Well?

1611
02:01:01,764 --> 02:01:03,557
What's your answer,
mule skinner?

1612
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:09,979
General...

1613
02:01:10,021 --> 02:01:12,190
you go down there.

1614
02:01:16,694 --> 02:01:19,571
You're advising me
to go into the Coulee?

1615
02:01:19,613 --> 02:01:20,572
Yes, sir.

1616
02:01:20,614 --> 02:01:23,784
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?

1617
02:01:23,825 --> 02:01:25,702
I didn't say that.

1618
02:01:25,744 --> 02:01:30,373
There are thousands
of Indians down there.

1619
02:01:30,414 --> 02:01:32,708
And when they get done with you,

1620
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:35,627
there won't be nothing left
but a greasy spot.

1621
02:01:35,668 --> 02:01:39,881
This ain't the Washita
River, General.

1622
02:01:39,923 --> 02:01:44,385
And them ain't helpless women
and children waiting for you.

1623
02:01:44,426 --> 02:01:47,513
They're Cheyenne brave
and Sioux.

1624
02:01:50,057 --> 02:01:54,227
You go down there
if you got the nerve.

1625
02:01:54,268 --> 02:01:58,981
Still trying to outsmart me,
aren't you, mule skinner?

1626
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:04,820
You want me to think that you
don't want me to go down there,

1627
02:02:04,861 --> 02:02:06,446
but the subtle truth is,

1628
02:02:06,488 --> 02:02:09,782
you really don't want me
to go down there.

1629
02:02:11,575 --> 02:02:15,329
Well, are you
reassured now, Major?

1630
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:27,965
Men of the seventh!

1631
02:02:28,048 --> 02:02:34,762
The hour of victory
is at hand!

1632
02:02:34,804 --> 02:02:41,852
Onward to Little Big Horn
and glory!

1633
02:03:28,018 --> 02:03:30,145
We've caught them napping!

1634
02:03:30,187 --> 02:03:32,271
Sound the charge!

1635
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:59,754
We have them on the run, men!

1636
02:04:02,715 --> 02:04:04,966
Take no prisoners!

1637
02:04:30,906 --> 02:04:33,409
Now we've got them, men!

1638
02:05:46,264 --> 02:05:47,682
Men, Custer's with you!

1639
02:05:47,724 --> 02:05:49,934
Custer's honor!
Stay with me!

1640
02:05:55,481 --> 02:05:57,066
What are they doing?

1641
02:05:57,107 --> 02:05:58,067
Why aren't they charging?

1642
02:05:58,108 --> 02:06:00,152
There's nowhere to charge to!

1643
02:06:04,155 --> 02:06:07,116
Fight! Stand up and fight!

1644
02:06:11,953 --> 02:06:14,498
Fools! They're shooting
their own horses.

1645
02:06:14,539 --> 02:06:16,750
Arrest them! Arrest them!

1646
02:06:16,792 --> 02:06:19,460
Bugler! Sound the charge!

1647
02:06:19,502 --> 02:06:21,337
We've got to make breast-works!

1648
02:06:21,379 --> 02:06:22,880
I know all about that, Major.

1649
02:06:22,922 --> 02:06:25,174
Don't try to tell me
my business.

1650
02:06:25,216 --> 02:06:28,343
Make breast-works, men!

1651
02:06:46,734 --> 02:06:48,486
Show them no mercy!

1652
02:06:50,321 --> 02:06:52,739
I said, give them a volley!

1653
02:06:54,324 --> 02:06:56,702
We're running out of ammunition,
General.

1654
02:06:56,702 --> 02:06:57,828
Right!

1655
02:06:57,869 --> 02:06:59,245
Now, we are running

1656
02:06:59,286 --> 02:07:00,997
out of ammunition.

1657
02:07:01,038 --> 02:07:02,039
I told him

1658
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:03,374
this would happen.

1659
02:07:03,374 --> 02:07:06,711
But he just sat there...
in the White House

1660
02:07:06,711 --> 02:07:08,253
and laughed at me!

1661
02:07:08,294 --> 02:07:10,255
That damn Cossack.

1662
02:07:15,343 --> 02:07:16,343
This is horrible...

1663
02:07:17,469 --> 02:07:18,554
We're being wiped out!

1664
02:07:20,139 --> 02:07:24,642
For Christian America...

1665
02:07:24,684 --> 02:07:27,478
Let your arrows fly, savages!

1666
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,522
I am unbowed!

1667
02:07:36,236 --> 02:07:38,822
Mr. President...

1668
02:07:38,864 --> 02:07:40,198
Mr. President...

1669
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:42,616
Distinguished visitors...

1670
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:46,120
honored members of the Senate!

1671
02:07:46,162 --> 02:07:48,205
Taking the Indian
as we find him,

1672
02:07:48,247 --> 02:07:50,957
- waiting...
- Oh, why don't you shut up?

1673
02:07:50,999 --> 02:07:54,252
Mr. President, you are drunk.

1674
02:07:55,462 --> 02:07:58,547
We can't have a man like you
in the White House!

1675
02:07:59,506 --> 02:08:02,176
Get on your feet
and face the enemy!

1676
02:08:02,217 --> 02:08:04,762
Go away, General.

1677
02:08:04,803 --> 02:08:06,304
All right.

1678
02:08:06,346 --> 02:08:08,389
The sentence is death.

1679
02:09:08,943 --> 02:09:11,404
All right...

1680
02:09:11,445 --> 02:09:13,446
then you know you and I
are even at last.

1681
02:09:13,488 --> 02:09:15,490
I paid you the life I owe you.

1682
02:09:15,532 --> 02:09:16,700
And the next time we meet,

1683
02:09:16,741 --> 02:09:19,411
I can kill you
without becoming an evil person.

1684
02:09:34,048 --> 02:09:36,718
He goes to dance his joy.

1685
02:09:37,843 --> 02:09:39,386
Grandfather.

1686
02:09:39,428 --> 02:09:42,973
I am glad to see you.

1687
02:09:43,015 --> 02:09:46,809
Glad to see you,
too, my son.

1688
02:09:46,851 --> 02:09:50,688
My heart soars like a hawk.

1689
02:09:50,688 --> 02:09:53,649
Do you want to eat?

1690
02:09:53,691 --> 02:09:56,401
I won't eat with you,

1691
02:09:56,443 --> 02:09:58,695
because I'm going to die soon.

1692
02:09:58,737 --> 02:10:01,906
Die, Grandfather?

1693
02:10:01,948 --> 02:10:03,157
Yes, my son.

1694
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:05,909
I want to die
in my own land

1695
02:10:05,951 --> 02:10:10,080
where Human Beings
are buried in the sky.

1696
02:10:12,874 --> 02:10:16,502
Well, why do you
want to die, Grandfather?

1697
02:10:16,544 --> 02:10:18,421
Because there's no other way

1698
02:10:18,463 --> 02:10:20,839
to deal with the white man,
my son.

1699
02:10:20,881 --> 02:10:24,009
Whatever else
you can say about them

1700
02:10:24,092 --> 02:10:25,927
it must be admitted:

1701
02:10:25,969 --> 02:10:28,387
You cannot get rid of them.

1702
02:10:33,017 --> 02:10:38,021
No, I suppose not, Grandfather.

1703
02:10:38,063 --> 02:10:41,858
There is an endless supply
of white man

1704
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:43,859
but there always has been

1705
02:10:43,901 --> 02:10:46,528
a limited number
of Human Beings.

1706
02:10:46,570 --> 02:10:49,907
We won today.

1707
02:10:53,076 --> 02:10:55,912
We won't win tomorrow.

1708
02:11:06,672 --> 02:11:10,758
Snake Woman, get me
my Elk burial robe.

1709
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:18,765
Come, my son.

1710
02:11:18,765 --> 02:11:20,767
We will go.

1711
02:11:26,355 --> 02:11:28,440
It makes my heart sad.

1712
02:11:28,482 --> 02:11:33,112
A world without Human Beings
has no center to it.

1713
02:11:33,153 --> 02:11:35,613
Go where, Grandfather?

1714
02:11:35,655 --> 02:11:37,782
To the mountain.

1715
02:11:37,824 --> 02:11:39,284
To the top.

1716
02:12:45,675 --> 02:12:48,219
Come out and fight!

1717
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:50,971
It is a good day to die!

1718
02:12:52,806 --> 02:12:57,143
Thank you for making me
a Human Being!

1719
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:04,108
Thank you for helping me
to become a warrior.

1720
02:13:06,318 --> 02:13:12,115
Thank you for my victories...
and for my defeats.

1721
02:13:13,658 --> 02:13:17,161
Thank you for my vision...

1722
02:13:17,286 --> 02:13:22,540
and the blindness
in which I saw further.

1723
02:13:25,543 --> 02:13:27,170
You make all things

1724
02:13:27,212 --> 02:13:31,298
and direct them in their ways,
oh, Grandfather.

1725
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:36,512
And now, you have
to silence the Human Beings!

1726
02:13:36,553 --> 02:13:40,348
We'll soon walk a road...

1727
02:13:43,851 --> 02:13:47,229
...that leads nowhere.

1728
02:14:04,703 --> 02:14:12,668
I am going to die now,
unless death wants to fight.

1729
02:14:12,710 --> 02:14:15,963
And I ask you for the last time

1730
02:14:16,005 --> 02:14:22,844
to grant me my old power
to make things happen.

1731
02:14:40,943 --> 02:14:44,155
Take care of my son, here.

1732
02:14:44,196 --> 02:14:47,866
See that he doesn't go crazy.

1733
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,451
Grandfather?

1734
02:15:50,630 --> 02:15:53,590
Am I still in this world?

1735
02:15:53,632 --> 02:15:55,592
Yes, Grandfather.

1736
02:16:04,267 --> 02:16:06,560
I was afraid of that.

1737
02:16:08,436 --> 02:16:16,319
Well, sometimes the magic works,
sometimes it doesn't.

1738
02:16:43,843 --> 02:16:47,680
Let's go back to the tepee
and eat, my son.

1739
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:51,308
My newest snake wife
cooks dog very well.

1740
02:16:51,349 --> 02:16:53,476
All right, Grandfather.

1741
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:58,772
She also has
a very soft skin.

1742
02:16:58,814 --> 02:17:03,152
The only trouble
with snake women

1743
02:17:03,193 --> 02:17:08,656
is they copulate with horses,
which makes them strange to me.

1744
02:17:08,698 --> 02:17:12,869
She says she doesn't,
that's why I call her

1745
02:17:12,869 --> 02:17:14,912
"Doesn't Like Horses."

1746
02:17:15,037 --> 02:17:18,206
But of course, she's lying.

1747
02:17:19,708 --> 02:17:22,294
Of course, Grandfather.

1748
02:17:24,587 --> 02:17:31,635
Well, that's the story
of this old Indian fighter.

1749
02:17:33,053 --> 02:17:36,598
That's the story
of the Human Beings,

1750
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:41,894
who was promised land where they
could live in... peace.

1751
02:17:41,936 --> 02:17:45,105
Land that would be theirs...

1752
02:17:45,147 --> 02:17:48,733
as long as grass grow...

1753
02:17:48,775 --> 02:17:52,111
wind blow...

1754
02:17:52,153 --> 02:17:54,113
and the sky is blue.

1755
02:17:54,155 --> 02:18:00,494
Mr. Crabb, I didn't know...

1756
02:18:00,535 --> 02:18:03,163
Get out, get out.
