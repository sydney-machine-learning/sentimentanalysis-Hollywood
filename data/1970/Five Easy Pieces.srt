1
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,658
I'm gonna play it again.

2
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:17,725
You play that thing one more time and
I'm gonna melt it down into hair spray.

3
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,547
Let me play that side then.

4
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:22,418
No, Rayette, it's not
a question of sides.

5
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,533
It's a question of musical integrity.

6
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,783
Then let me sing one for you.

7
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:30,265
-When there's a fire...
-Hold it.

8
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:33,555
Bobby!

9
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:34,817
You quit that now!

10
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,150
You said you're gonna
help me pick a song.

11
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:41,764
I'm gonna cut off
your damn water, Bobby. I swear.

12
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,934
Selfish.

13
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,737
You play on the piano...

14
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,685
...and your whole family can play
on some type of musical instrument.

15
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:58,843
All I'm asking is for you
to help me improve my musical talent.

16
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:01,217
You would think you would.

17
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:05,156
Why don't you take
that sign off your tit...

18
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:09,076
...and let's you and me go out
and have some real good time?

19
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:12,082
Where are we going?

20
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,823
I don't know. I'll holler up
to Elton and Stoney.

21
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,698
Bobby, now listen a minute.

22
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,516
You know, I'll go out with you...

23
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,788
...or I'll stay in with you...

24
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,720
...or I'll do anything
that you'd like for me to do...

25
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,896
...if you would tell me
that you love me.

26
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,087
You can sing the song.

27
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:53,539
You are never satisfied.

28
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,344
That's right.

29
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:04,257
-Honey, I'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

30
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,847
All right. Here it is.

31
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,041
They were all set up right for you.

32
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,379
Get it right in there, Dipesto.

33
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,572
All you gotta do, just relax, honey.

34
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,687
Keep that left foot forward.

35
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,449
Set her down!

36
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,504
Not too much of a match, is it, EI?

37
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,294
Don't lead out with your right foot.

38
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:53,202
-ln the gutter. Isn't that wonderf ul?
-lt's just heavy for me.

39
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,965
The pins, you know. I can't see them.

40
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,687
Just squint. I squint.

41
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,107
There they are right down there.
All these little boards.

42
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,775
You notice them leading down?
Just spot...

43
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:04,962
But there's so many.

44
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:06,201
What's that for?

45
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:07,620
That's for luck.

46
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,913
-Get on out there.
-Great, he slobbered on me.

47
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,453
Yeah, ain't the first time.

48
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,697
Watch this.

49
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,569
There she is. She's doing a little
variation on "The Apache Shift"!

50
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,327
I taught her that.

51
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:25,946
-Are you mad at me?
-No, I'm not mad at you.

52
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,184
-lt'll be all right.
-Tell me you're not mad at me.

53
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,356
I'm not mad at you.

54
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:36,864
Go on, beat it.

55
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,989
-I'll show you how it's done.
-Don't talk about it. Do it!

56
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:41,236
Isn't he pretty?

57
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:47,632
Good one!

58
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,345
Show me a little something now.
Give me spirit!

59
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:05,349
It's just the thing
just goes off cocky-wobbly.

60
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,281
Just do what I tell you.

61
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,116
I did, didn't l, EI?

62
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,392
You got another ball coming.

63
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,237
-Come on, Rayette!
-Just relax.

64
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,493
That's a boy, Ray!

65
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,284
That was real good, wasn't it?

66
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:29,130
I finally did it.

67
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:32,604
Great! You throw
the big Z's for 19 f rames...

68
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:36,665
...and then you throw a strike
on the last ball of the losing game.

69
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:40,360
Wonderf ul, just wonderf ul.
Wasn't that wonderf ul, ladies?

70
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,074
Are you talking to us?

71
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:43,737
Wonderf ul.

72
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,457
I guess I'll go wait in the car.

73
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:50,158
Why don't you go
wait in the car, Rayette?

74
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,868
I will. I'll wait there right now.

75
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,173
One minute, honey,
and I'll go with you.

76
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,541
Me and Stoney got to get on home.
Relieve the sitter.

77
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,902
Why don't you and Ray
just come on by the place?

78
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,486
All right, why don't you go on?

79
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:15,259
Here. I'll take care of the beers.

80
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,936
And would you walk Rayette
along with you?

81
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:20,198
-Sure.
-Thanks, EI.

82
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:42,050
What do we owe you?

83
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:43,784
Four dollars, sir.

84
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:47,089
Ex cuse me.

85
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,645
Here's a five. Thanks very much.

86
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,359
We've been wanting to ask you...

87
00:08:57,697 --> 00:09:00,416
...you're on the TV, aren't you?

88
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,558
Am I?

89
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:05,864
She says you're the guy
that sells all the cars...

90
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,966
...on TV.

91
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,082
I might've sold a few cars.

92
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,697
I told you!

93
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:19,122
My name's Shirley, but they
call me Betty. And her name's Twinky.

94
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,532
-Twinky?
-Yeah, because she's so "twinky"!

95
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,123
Boy, oh, boy!

96
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,742
Well, Betty and Twinky,
it sure is nice talking to you girls.

97
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:32,140
I wish I had some more time.

98
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:34,594
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?

99
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:37,171
I told her that you're wearing a wig...

100
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:40,879
...because on the TV
you're mostly all...

101
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:42,988
...bald up there.

102
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,839
Hey, your little f riend's real sharp.

103
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,632
I don't...

104
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:52,307
I don't wear the wig on TV.
If you're gonna be out there...

105
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:56,094
...in f ront of 2 million people,
you got to be sincere.

106
00:09:56,498 --> 00:10:00,047
I like to wear it in bowling alleys
and slipping around.

107
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,021
It gives me a little class.
What do you think?

108
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:06,728
Yeah, but I can see
a little bitty of a net up there.

109
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,844
That's what gave it away.

110
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:10,746
A little net?

111
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,100
Well, I...

112
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:16,698
I wish I had more time
to talk to you girls, but...

113
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,248
I have to... I'll...

114
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,465
Come on, Ray.
We're gonna go over to Elton's.

115
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,382
I'm not.

116
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,071
You're just gonna sit here?

117
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,814
Yes.

118
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,663
Okay, I hope no one hits on you.

119
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,423
I hope they do.

120
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:53,514
See you later.

121
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:23,175
No one would want to hit on you.
You look too pathetic.

122
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:28,638
Come on, Dipesto,
we can still have a good time.

123
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:33,051
You're the pathetic one. Not me.

124
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,020
I'm going over to Elton's.

125
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,512
I am not a piece of crap.

126
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,025
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,955
You treat me like I was.

128
00:11:56,896 --> 00:12:01,128
Go slip around,
right before my face...

129
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:05,344
...and in f ront of Elton
and Stoney that way.

130
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:10,128
What do you imagine they think
of somebody you treat like that?

131
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:12,289
Now, now, Ray.

132
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,249
Now, sweetheart, Elton and Stoney
know that I love you.

133
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,256
They're just gonna think that
I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not...

134
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:30,507
...and that you're a hell of a good person
for putting up with me, that's all.

135
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:34,362
You'll just find me dead one time.

136
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,146
You'll just kill me.

137
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:43,953
Come on, be a good girl.

138
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,957
If you ever really
get up and leave me...

139
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,467
...you'll read about it
in the newsprint.

140
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,731
I'm not gonna get up and leave you.

141
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:01,927
Now come on.

142
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:05,397
Let's go over to Elton's
and have a good time.

143
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:10,242
You love me, Bobby?

144
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,435
What do you think?

145
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,395
You got banana on your face.

146
00:13:58,753 --> 00:13:59,947
I do?

147
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:06,694
I still ain't figured out how
you got me working back out here.

148
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:10,040
I got you to come out here?

149
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,977
I ain't figured out how you let me
get you to work on these rigs.

150
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:17,980
I never worked on these things before.
You worked on them before.

151
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,313
I can't figure out how
you let me get us out here.

152
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,046
Somebody had to look out for you.

153
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:27,438
You're a mess.

154
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:31,442
You're crazy.

155
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,688
-I'm gonna bet $2 right off.
-I'm in.

156
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,761
You're bullshitting me now.

157
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:56,408
-I have to see it.
-I got a pair of nine.

158
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:57,518
Can you beat two pair?

159
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:00,837
-There's three aces, right there.
-Piss on you.

160
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,284
I got me a hand there!

161
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,560
It's time for me to go home.
See you in the morning, boys.

162
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,849
See you, Glen.

163
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,224
I don't know if I'm going
out there tomorrow at all, man.

164
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,525
I got a lot of money tied up,
and everything I got telling me to...

165
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:20,228
I don't want no chains
going around, and all this.

166
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:24,770
I prefer card playing. Where is it?
What the hell is going on in this game?

167
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,720
People talking...
We got money here, or what?

168
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,953
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

169
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:33,853
To Banbury Cross we go

170
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:39,180
When I was 4, just 4 years old...

171
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:43,285
...I went to my mother and I said,
"What's this hole?"

172
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,797
I saw this dimple in my chin.
I didn't know what it was.

173
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:48,775
And my mother says:

174
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,290
"When you're born, you go
on an assembly line past God.

175
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:56,318
If He likes you, He says, 'You cute
little thing, ' and you get dimples.

176
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:59,728
And if He doesn't like you,
He goes, 'Go away."'

177
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:04,108
So about six months later
my mother found me saying my prayers.

178
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,886
And I was going,
" Now I lay me down to sleep."

179
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:10,200
She says, "What're you
covering up your chin for?"

180
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:13,610
And I said,
" Because if I cover up the hole...

181
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,751
...maybe He'll listen to me."

182
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,970
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

183
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:24,967
To Banbury Cross we go

184
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:38,464
Do you wanna buy a ticket
To a raffle of a dog

185
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,900
That comes a runnin' licking
When you whistle, holler, "Claude"

186
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:47,199
A big brown dog just as sound as a ring

187
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,722
He'll be 8 years old
If he lives to the spring

188
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,683
Unfit! Do I look unfit to you, Elton?

189
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,150
I'm fit! I'm fit!

190
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,251
If you haven't got your ticket yet

191
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,411
Well, you better order it

192
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,327
He'll wet your carpet
And he'll fertilize your grass

193
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,874
And he's got three white feet
And a hole in his ass

194
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:15,102
Don't you know no songs
about women or nothing?

195
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:19,751
Yeah, but I'm just too loaded
to think of them now.

196
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,830
Watch out for all this traffic.

197
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,202
Watch out for all this traffic.

198
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:25,031
-God!
-I ain't in no hurry.

199
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:29,354
Can you believe starting off your day
like this, going to work?

200
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,954
Unbelievable.
Let me have a drink, will you?

201
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,719
Thanks, Elton.

202
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,889
Boy! That's tough in the morning.

203
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:45,015
What the hell are
these people doing here?

204
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,721
Isn't this some goddamn thing, Elton?

205
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,439
Jesus Christ!

206
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:03,952
What does he want? What I can't stand
is sitting on this goddamn f reeway.

207
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,515
Why don't you flash your lights so as we
can see what else you got for Christmas?

208
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:19,306
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

209
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:21,678
Where are you going?

210
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:29,766
Why don't we all line up
like a goddamn bunch of ants...

211
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,596
...in the most beautif ul
part of the day and gas ourselves?

212
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,008
Hey, get off my car!

213
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,235
Hey, Bobby!

214
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,882
Shit! What's he doing?

215
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,123
Play it!

216
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,670
Bob, quit fooling around! Come on!

217
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:01,483
Bobby!

218
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:03,534
He's turning!

219
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:53,222
I was with Elton last night, Ray.

220
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,352
It's the truth.

221
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,046
Rayette?

222
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,695
Son of a bitch!

223
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:54,746
Now reach for it.
Come on, reach for it!

224
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:56,455
Come on!

225
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:59,587
Good boy!
Come on, let's go see Bob.

226
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:01,649
I can't see!

227
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,315
Isn't he sweet?

228
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:14,294
Can't see the set well.

229
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,450
You take him for a while now.

230
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:18,186
Go ahead now.

231
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,930
How you doing?

232
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,561
You ought to get yourself
one of them, Bob.

233
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:34,853
That's it. Just crush that one too,
then I won't get any.

234
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:38,572
Well, bless my soul,
it's a new harmonica!

235
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,083
That's for your birthday.

236
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:43,906
Well, how do you know
when my birthday is?

237
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:45,502
Bye, Stoney.

238
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,329
Bye, Stoney.

239
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,081
Kitchen's on fire, Stoney.

240
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,482
Your mother just died, Stoney.

241
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,373
Bye-bye.

242
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:01,806
See you out in the field, Bob.

243
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,799
Okay, thanks a lot.

244
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,408
Honey, you just love
that little baby, don't you?

245
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:14,161
Well? What if she was, Bob?

246
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:17,102
I can't see nothing so bad in that.

247
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:21,372
What if I let you in
on a little secret, that she is?

248
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:23,918
That's right.

249
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,693
She told me.

250
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:29,307
She's all torn up about it too,
which I hate to see.

251
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:33,522
Isn't it something
you just have to face up to?

252
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:37,530
Somewhere along the line,
you even get to liking the whole idea.

253
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,060
When Stoney first gave me the news,
I could've shit!

254
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,402
Well, isn't that nice?

255
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,748
It's ridiculous! I'm here,
listening to some cracker asshole...

256
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:56,474
...lives in a trailer park,
compare his life to mine!

257
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:04,429
Keep on telling me about the good life,
because it makes me puke.

258
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:09,171
If you think you're something better
than what I am, that's something else.

259
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:14,510
I can't say much of someone who could
leave a woman in a situation like this.

260
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:16,624
That's all I have to say.

261
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:21,683
I'm glad that's all, because I'm
as tired of your mouth as I am...

262
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:24,662
...working on this goddamn job!

263
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:30,837
Shit-ass!

264
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,306
Hey! Longcipher!

265
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,804
Hey! Longcipher!

266
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,339
I'm quitting!

267
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:58,085
Do you hear me? I said I'm quitting.

268
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,467
I don't give a damn what you do.

269
00:26:00,807 --> 00:26:03,844
I'm glad to get rid
of the both of you dumb guys.

270
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:21,022
Hey!

271
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:23,528
What's going on?

272
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:33,619
What's going on?

273
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:40,869
Don't do that, Bob!
Don't mix in!

274
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:44,103
They got the right, Bob! It's the law!

275
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,300
It's the law!

276
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,676
Don't you think you could
just leave him?

277
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:10,502
If he'd have known who you were,
he wouldn't have done that. Bob?

278
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:12,924
What the hell's going on?

279
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:14,857
All right, let him go.

280
00:27:17,124 --> 00:27:18,603
What's going on, Elton?

281
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:23,468
I got accused of robbing
the filling station. Didn't I tell you?

282
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,349
I just got wild and jumped my bail.

283
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:30,709
And here they come running at me a whole
year later. Isn't that something?

284
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:35,327
Hey, tell Stoney for me, you hear?

285
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:52,026
Hi.

286
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,482
Miss Dupea?

287
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,704
Upstairs.
It's upstairs and to the right.

288
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:47,435
There she goes again.

289
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:51,639
My 1 -year-old can
carry a tune better than that.

290
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,726
Miss Dupea?

291
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:12,321
I'd like to remind you again that this
is not an opera or a musical comedy.

292
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,423
I'm sorry. Was I singing again?

293
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,952
If you wanna call it that.

294
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,437
You have simply to tell me.
That's all.

295
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,030
That's exactly what I am doing again.

296
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,312
You let me get 2l3 of the way through
the movement... This is tiring me.

297
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:35,732
I have another suggestion.
Why don't we take a break?

298
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,160
For pity's sake!

299
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:38,654
Is she gonna cry again?

300
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:40,565
I don't want to take a break.

301
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:41,881
Some coffee?

302
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,933
What would you like
in your coffee, Miss Dupea?

303
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:47,662
-Tea.
-One tea.

304
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:49,296
Tell her Bobby's here.

305
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:51,242
Bobby's here.

306
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:57,060
Oh, my goodness!

307
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:02,277
Robert Eroica.

308
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:14,978
I can't look at you.

309
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,507
Well, don't, then.

310
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,153
You always do this to me.

311
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,182
I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.

312
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,626
Thank you.

313
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:32,460
-Don't put it there.
-Why? What's wrong?

314
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,929
This is a very special CB-275.

315
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,826
No kidding?

316
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:44,505
It has absolutely
no objectionable idiosyncrasies.

317
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:55,028
Robert, I have to talk seriously to you.

318
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:58,130
Everybody still living up on the island?

319
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:04,348
At the moment, there's really
just Daddy, Carl and myself...

320
00:32:04,795 --> 00:32:06,023
...and Van Oost.

321
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,888
-Who's Van Oost?
-Catherine.

322
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:10,846
She's a pianist.
She's working with Carl.

323
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:13,817
Carl's a fiddler.
What's he doing coaching piano?

324
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:16,221
Well, 11 months ago...

325
00:32:16,554 --> 00:32:20,911
...he was on his bicycle on his way
to the post office in the village.

326
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:25,390
And he ran straight into a Jeep
and sprained his neck.

327
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:28,160
Strained his neck?

328
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,568
That's not f unny.
He permanently sprained his neck.

329
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:36,737
And since then it's been extremely
painf ul for him to tuck the violin.

330
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:40,234
Crashes into a Jeep
and totals his neck!

331
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,314
Robert?

332
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,885
I have...
I have to tell you.

333
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,838
Daddy's very ill.

334
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:01,037
What's...

335
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,671
-What?
-He's had two strokes.

336
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:13,506
He's not...

337
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:18,621
They feel he...
He might not recover f rom it.

338
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,934
Don't tell me about this.

339
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:31,202
But don't you think it's right
that you should see him at least once?

340
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:34,324
-Miss Dupea?
-Just a minute, please!

341
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:36,978
Don't you think it's right
you should see him?

342
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:39,007
Yeah, I guess so.

343
00:33:39,336 --> 00:33:41,975
I'm going back tonight.
Will you come with me?

344
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:43,866
No.

345
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:47,189
I'd rather drive up.

346
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:50,305
Maybe I'll go into Canada after.

347
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:55,217
I'm not gonna stay long, Tita.
One week at the most.

348
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,794
I know.

349
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,132
Well...

350
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,087
Come on, I'll walk you out.

351
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,428
I'll be back in two minutes.

352
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:12,694
We've had our break, Miss Dupea.

353
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,591
They hate me, I feel.

354
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,025
Maybe you better stay.

355
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:22,420
I want to talk to you
about so many things.

356
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,347
I'll be seeing you in a couple of days.

357
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,304
I'm so glad.

358
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,399
Me too.

359
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:33,202
Bye.

360
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,169
Hello?

361
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,946
You got the day off?

362
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:40,503
Are you sick?

363
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:50,291
I guess you heard about Elton.

364
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:56,077
I got your point.

365
00:36:56,385 --> 00:37:00,424
I hope you didn't strain yourself
getting in here before I hit the door.

366
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,433
I have to go home.

367
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,226
My father's sick.

368
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:21,335
I'll be gone for two or three weeks.

369
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,935
You'll be gone, period.

370
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,813
I'll try and call you f rom up there.

371
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,658
Come on, Dipesto.

372
00:37:57,939 --> 00:38:01,136
I never told you that
it would work out to anything.

373
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:03,929
Did I?

374
00:38:09,032 --> 00:38:11,990
I'll send you some money.
That's all I can do.

375
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:18,260
I'll try and call you f rom up there.

376
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:24,348
Bye, Ray.

377
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:15,425
You wanna go with me?

378
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:10,917
There's been hot spells and cold spells
Ever since we met

379
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:15,900
I've seen your big fires, small fires
But I won't give up yet

380
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,048
Oh, someday you'll yearn
Because your heart's gonna burn

381
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:25,111
For that old familiar glow

382
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:27,594
You'll be burnt...

383
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:30,676
-Like it?
-I love it.

384
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:34,668
You'll be burnt out or smoked out

385
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:36,790
And come back to me

386
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:37,951
I know

387
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,030
-What the hell are they doing?
-ls that...

388
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,411
Is that an accident?

389
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,036
Who was driving?

390
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:50,493
Who was driving? You were driving!

391
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:52,832
Hey, what the hell's going on?

392
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,371
Rotate, mac!

393
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:58,891
Look at my car! Look at my car!

394
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:02,216
I just bought it brand-new
f rom the used-car lot!

395
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,879
You're lucky nobody was hurt.

396
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:05,134
Give us a lift?

397
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:06,632
Terry, we got a ride!

398
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:09,452
You gonna give those people a lift?

399
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:14,048
-I can't just leave them here.
-I'd like to punch that son of a bitch!

400
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:16,960
Jesus! What a rude person!

401
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,644
What's your name?

402
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:23,670
Palm Apodaca.

403
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:26,532
What's your name?

404
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:28,310
Terry Grouse.

405
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,153
What?

406
00:41:31,878 --> 00:41:33,869
How far are you going to?

407
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:35,768
Washington.

408
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:39,874
We'll get off in Washington.
We'll hook a ride.

409
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,026
Where are you going?

410
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:43,581
Alaska.

411
00:41:44,222 --> 00:41:45,291
Alaska?

412
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:47,077
What are you? On vacation?

413
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:50,110
She wants to live there
because it's cleaner.

414
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:51,483
Cleaner?

415
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,488
Cleaner than what?

416
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:59,410
Don't tell everybody. Soon they'll all
go there, and it won't be so clean.

417
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:02,639
What makes you think it's cleaner?

418
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,941
I saw a picture of it.

419
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:09,639
Alaska's very clean.
It appeared to look very white to me.

420
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:11,837
Don't you think?

421
00:42:12,538 --> 00:42:15,735
Yep. That was before the big thaw.

422
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,020
Before the what?

423
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,126
I had to leave because
I got depressed seeing all the crap.

424
00:42:40,229 --> 00:42:42,299
And they're making more crap,
you know?

425
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:45,166
They got so many stores
f ull of crap...

426
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:46,799
...I can't believe it.

427
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:47,941
Who?

428
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,192
Who?

429
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:51,038
Man, that's who.

430
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,549
Pretty soon,
there won't be any room for man.

431
00:42:56,285 --> 00:43:01,120
They're selling more crap that people
go and buy than you can imagine. Crap!

432
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,522
Everybody should have a big hole
where they burn the stuff.

433
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:09,756
They'd never find
a hole big enough. Never.

434
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,488
Now, take me. Look at me.

435
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:15,393
When I was just one person,
before I was with Bobby...

436
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,760
...I was collecting onto me
more garbage every day...

437
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,289
...till I was thinking
that I should get a disposal.

438
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,835
Disposal?

439
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,374
What's that but more crap!
I've never seen such crap!

440
00:43:27,729 --> 00:43:29,321
Mass production does it.

441
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:31,683
To be honest,
you're not clean either.

442
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:34,414
I'm not that neat maybe,
but I am clean.

443
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:36,096
Well, you're not that bad.

444
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:38,159
But some people.

445
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,697
People's homes. Just filth!
I've been in homes...

446
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:45,193
I think that more people
are neat than are clean.

447
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:50,493
In my personal thing, I don't see that.
I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth.

448
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:54,193
What they need to do every day
is a cockroach thing...

449
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:56,703
...where they spray the homes...

450
00:43:57,047 --> 00:44:00,357
Can you imagine if their doors were
a pretty colour, with a pot outside?

451
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,875
-Could be adorable.
-And they picked up!

452
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:06,055
It wouldn't be filthy
without Coke bottles and whiskey...

453
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:09,630
...and those signs everywhere.
They should be erased!

454
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:12,531
All those signs
selling you crap and more crap!

455
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:16,448
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't even want to talk about it.

456
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:19,309
It's just filthy! People are filthy!

457
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:22,290
That's the biggest thing
that's wrong with people!

458
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:26,844
I think if they were clean
they wouldn't have anybody to pick on.

459
00:44:27,907 --> 00:44:29,260
Dirt!

460
00:44:29,576 --> 00:44:33,649
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad.
It's filth! Filth is bad.

461
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,639
That's what starts maggots and riots.

462
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:40,502
Follow that truck.
They know the best places to stop.

463
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:42,993
That's an old maid's tale.

464
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,176
Bullshit!

465
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:47,414
Truck drivers know the best places.

466
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:51,547
Salesmen and cops know. If you'd
ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.

467
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:52,963
Don't call me " honey, " mac.

468
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:55,822
Don't call me "mac, " honey!

469
00:44:58,476 --> 00:45:01,195
I wouldn't be a waitress.
They're f ull of crap.

470
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:03,966
You just hold on to your tongue!

471
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:05,751
Hold on to this.

472
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:08,709
If you think you can...

473
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:10,134
Shut up!

474
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:11,802
All of you!

475
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:20,841
I'd like a plain omelette,
no potatoes, tomatoes instead...

476
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:23,441
...a cup of coffee and wheat toast.

477
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,859
No substitutions.

478
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:28,006
You don't have any tomatoes?

479
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:29,727
Only what's on the menu.

480
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:33,879
You can have a plain omelette.
Comes with cottage f ries and rolls.

481
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:37,170
I know what it comes with,
but it's not what I want.

482
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:39,384
I'll come back
when you make up your mind.

483
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:40,907
I have made up my mind.

484
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:44,586
I'd like a plain omelette,
no potatoes on the plate.

485
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:47,402
A cup of coffee
and a side order of wheat toast.

486
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:50,002
We don't have any side orders of toast.

487
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:52,543
I'll give you a muffin
or a coffee roll.

488
00:45:52,857 --> 00:45:56,975
You don't make side orders of toast?
You make sandwiches, don't you?

489
00:45:58,195 --> 00:45:59,833
Wanna talk to the manager?

490
00:46:00,114 --> 00:46:01,069
Hey, mac!

491
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:02,683
Shut up!

492
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:05,904
You've got bread
and a toaster of some kind?

493
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:07,597
I don't make the rules.

494
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,589
Okay, I'll make it
as easy for you as I can.

495
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:15,666
I'd like an omelette, plain, and
a chicken-salad sandwich on wheat toast.

496
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:19,677
No mayonnaise, no butter,
no lettuce and a cup of coffee.

497
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:22,284
A number two, chicken-salad sand.

498
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:26,751
Hold the butter, the lettuce
and the mayonnaise, and a cup of coffee.

499
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,089
Anything else?

500
00:46:28,347 --> 00:46:31,783
Yeah, now hold the chicken,
bring me the toast...

501
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:35,976
...give me a check for the sandwich,
and you haven't broken any rules.

502
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:38,390
You want me to hold the chicken, huh?

503
00:46:38,814 --> 00:46:42,011
I want you to hold it
between your knees.

504
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:44,721
You see that sign, sir?

505
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:49,723
You all have to leave. I'm not taking
any more of your smartness and sarcasm!

506
00:46:50,158 --> 00:46:52,069
You see this sign?

507
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:56,755
Fantastic that you could
figure that all out...

508
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,197
...so that you could come up
with a way to get your toast!

509
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:01,895
I didn't get it, did I?

510
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,283
No, but it was very clever.
I would've just punched her out.

511
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,330
People! Shit!

512
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,631
Animals are not like that.

513
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:21,305
They're always cleaning themselves.
Do you ever see pigeons?

514
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,204
He's always picking
on himself and his f riends.

515
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:28,640
Always picking bugs out of their hair.

516
00:47:28,942 --> 00:47:33,379
Monkeys too. Ex cept they do something
out in the open that I don't go for.

517
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:42,660
You know, I read where they
invented this car that runs on...

518
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:44,971
...that runs on...

519
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,484
When you boil water?

520
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:49,536
Steam.

521
00:47:49,793 --> 00:47:52,466
A car that you could ride in
and not cause a stink.

522
00:47:52,796 --> 00:47:56,027
But do you know they
will not even let us have it?

523
00:47:56,383 --> 00:47:57,975
Can you believe it?

524
00:47:58,259 --> 00:47:59,248
Why?

525
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:00,546
Man!

526
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,722
He likes to create a stink!

527
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:06,005
I mean, I've seen filth
that you wouldn't believe.

528
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,783
What a stink!

529
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:10,479
I don't even wanna talk about it.

530
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,927
You depressed about your daddy, hon?

531
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,935
No.

532
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,962
I imagine it's me then, isn't it?

533
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,510
Is what you?

534
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,398
Are you depressed I come along?

535
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,191
Who says I'm depressed?

536
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,940
Is that a happy face I see?

537
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:38,804
Because if it is,
I'll just catch a Greyhound back.

538
00:49:40,808 --> 00:49:44,847
Oh, you're not gonna kill yourself
this time. I wish I'd known.

539
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:01,728
Well...

540
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:05,948
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to get to sleep.

541
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:08,507
Hint, hint.

542
00:50:14,421 --> 00:50:17,219
Guess I'll have to count the sheep.

543
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:19,156
One...

544
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:20,661
...two...

545
00:50:20,968 --> 00:50:22,287
...three...

546
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:23,997
...four...

547
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:25,708
...five...

548
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,334
...six...

549
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,752
...seven...

550
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:35,978
Look at this old cold shoulder.

551
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:40,979
What am I going to do about it?

552
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:51,360
You know, if you wouldn't open your
mouth, everything would be just fine.

553
00:50:55,499 --> 00:50:56,898
Take a look.

554
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,665
Why can't I come out with you
to your family's house?

555
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:14,171
I have to see what's going on first.

556
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:19,112
My father's sick. They wouldn't be
prepared for my bringing anyone.

557
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:21,910
How long do I have to sit in that place?

558
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:24,267
If you can't do what I'm asking you...

559
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:28,122
...why don't you take the money
and go on back south with it?

560
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:30,413
Don't talk like that.

561
00:51:30,697 --> 00:51:34,167
Try to understand
this is not something that I wanna do.

562
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:37,294
Jesus Christ, you ought to
know me well enough for that!

563
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:39,860
All right, honey.

564
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:44,372
It'll be all right.
I mean, there's stuff for me to do.

565
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,269
They got magazines in there
and TV, right?

566
00:51:48,879 --> 00:51:51,677
I'll try and call you
in a couple of days.

567
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:54,502
All right.

568
00:51:55,635 --> 00:51:56,829
Bye.

569
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:39,788
He doesn't even know who the hell I am.

570
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:05,193
-Remember, mother used to say, " Bobby..."
-Ex cuse me.

571
00:56:05,606 --> 00:56:07,358
-Go ahead.
-Ex cuse me.

572
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:11,358
I was going to ask Robert how long
it had been since he'd been away.

573
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:13,450
Three years.

574
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:15,929
No, it's more like two years, isn't it?

575
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:17,874
It's been more than that.

576
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,515
Tita, you have no sense of timing
away f rom the piano, dear.

577
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,519
I don't think that's true.

578
00:56:23,872 --> 00:56:25,066
It's true.

579
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:26,889
What have you been doing?

580
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:30,898
Odd jobs. I work here and there.
Nothing too interesting.

581
00:56:31,837 --> 00:56:33,270
You no longer play at all?

582
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:35,269
Before my misfortune...

583
00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:38,017
I'm not sure
you're aware of my accident.

584
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:40,022
Tita was telling me about it.

585
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:41,257
It's difficult...

586
00:56:41,512 --> 00:56:43,230
...for me to turn my neck.

587
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:45,944
This way especially.
If I look at Catherine...

588
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:49,221
...I shift the whole base
of my body around this way.

589
00:56:49,603 --> 00:56:51,958
I was real sorry to hear about it, Carl.

590
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:55,074
I said, I was real sorry
to hear about it.

591
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,469
Anyways...

592
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:59,482
Catherine, what was I saying?

593
00:57:06,618 --> 00:57:11,294
Yes, just after I'd come off tour
with the Betenthaller Quartet.

594
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:14,219
Father, Herbert and I
had a summit conference.

595
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:15,816
A summit conference?

596
00:57:16,126 --> 00:57:18,560
Where was I?
Polishing silver behind the coal bin?

597
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:21,677
Well, I don't know where you were,
penis envy.

598
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:23,408
I hope I didn't hear that.

599
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:28,877
They wanted a detective to ferret
you out, and I talked them out of it.

600
00:57:29,263 --> 00:57:31,777
Whatever you were doing,
you had a right to do...

601
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:36,933
...no matter how nonsensical your
ventures may be. It was that simple.

602
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:38,794
I really appreciate it, Carl.

603
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:42,976
I don't think you ought to imply
that Daddy was wrong in f ront of Daddy.

604
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,323
Don't force him that way.

605
00:57:47,237 --> 00:57:48,670
How long have you been here?

606
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:51,130
Only two months.

607
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:56,140
Well, satiety is my father and mother!

608
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,774
Carl?

609
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:04,086
If you're finished,
I think I'd like to go do some work.

610
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:05,651
Certainly, dear.

611
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:08,279
Ex cuse me. See you later.

612
00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:11,212
I hope you feel right at home.

613
00:58:11,509 --> 00:58:13,101
I feel fine.

614
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,507
He has ways of communicating, Robert.

615
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:53,623
I can tell when he's expressing approval
or disapproval. Just f rom his eyes.

616
00:58:54,045 --> 00:58:55,683
Yeah.

617
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:57,316
Some range.

618
00:58:58,717 --> 00:59:02,630
I can't take much more of seeing him
sitting there like a stone.

619
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:04,217
It's not that bad.

620
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:05,995
Yes, it is.

621
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:08,966
Will you stay a while?

622
00:59:13,812 --> 00:59:15,245
I don't know.

623
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:50,163
Breathe!

624
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,373
All right!

625
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:56,730
Now once more, once more...

626
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:11,484
Hello.

627
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:14,774
Hi. I've been
looking all over for you.

628
01:00:15,118 --> 01:00:16,756
You have? I went riding.

629
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:17,946
Riding?

630
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,075
That's dangerous, you know.

631
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:21,983
Riding?

632
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:26,170
Play the piano all day and then
jump on a horse, you can get cramps.

633
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,592
Well, I like to ride.

634
01:00:29,881 --> 01:00:33,760
Rain or shine, I do it any chance
I can get. It's very invigorating.

635
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,131
-ls it?
-Yes.

636
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:40,068
Well, I don't like to get
too invigorated, myself.

637
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:41,792
You don't?

638
01:00:42,308 --> 01:00:43,866
What else do you do?

639
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:47,187
Well, there's fishing, boating.

640
01:00:48,188 --> 01:00:51,100
There's concerts on the mainland.

641
01:00:52,192 --> 01:00:54,706
I feel silly telling you this.
This is your home.

642
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,018
You know what there is to do.

643
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,515
Nothing.

644
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:01,412
Nothing?

645
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,019
Nothing.

646
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,360
It must be very boring for you here.

647
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,262
That's right.

648
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,493
I find that hard to comprehend.

649
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,783
I don't think I've ever been bored.

650
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:15,564
Ex cuse me.

651
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:23,269
What're you doing right now?

652
01:01:23,552 --> 01:01:27,545
Right now, I plan to take a hot tub
and soak myself.

653
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:29,733
Then after that?

654
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,453
After that...

655
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:34,479
...I plan to read some music
and rest for a while.

656
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:36,605
Tomorrow, then?

657
01:01:37,815 --> 01:01:40,648
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow's a f ull practice day.

658
01:01:40,985 --> 01:01:43,374
But the day after tomorrow
I will be f ree.

659
01:01:43,944 --> 01:01:46,583
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.

660
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:48,350
The day after tomorrow?

661
01:01:48,658 --> 01:01:49,807
Will you be f ree?

662
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:52,646
Yeah, I'll probably be f ree.

663
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:15,713
One thing I find...

664
01:02:15,974 --> 01:02:17,930
...very difficult to imagine...

665
01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:22,199
...is that one could have this
incredible background in music...

666
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:24,998
...and walk away f rom it
without a second thought.

667
01:02:25,357 --> 01:02:26,676
I gave it a second thought.

668
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:33,604
I mean, how could you no longer play
at all? I think that's very strange.

669
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,981
I played a little bit here and there.

670
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:40,117
As a matter of fact,
once I was a rehearsal pianist.

671
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:41,940
For ballet? An opera?

672
01:02:42,622 --> 01:02:44,772
Las Vegas musical revue.

673
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,003
-You don't call that music!
-Oh, yes, I do.

674
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,606
It's music, you know.

675
01:02:56,717 --> 01:02:58,947
Bring on the girls
I'm singing you a song

676
01:03:16,234 --> 01:03:17,553
Are you feeling better?

677
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,811
I feel great.

678
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,132
More gingerbread?

679
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,444
No, thank you.

680
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:39,237
Applesauce?

681
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:49,662
You know what I suggest, Ray?

682
01:04:50,026 --> 01:04:51,982
Well, that's what I suggest...

683
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,471
...because I don't know
how long it's gonna be.

684
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,126
I have to go now.

685
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:04,884
I have to get off now, Ray.

686
01:05:12,088 --> 01:05:13,726
Yeah, well...

687
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:16,800
I'll try and call you
in a couple of days.

688
01:05:17,175 --> 01:05:19,484
If you're gone, you're gone.

689
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:21,038
Bye.

690
01:05:24,056 --> 01:05:27,366
Robert, my playing put father to sleep.

691
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:29,720
Would you help me with this, please?

692
01:05:32,146 --> 01:05:33,499
That's it.

693
01:05:39,862 --> 01:05:42,422
You sure you should be playing, Carl?

694
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:46,022
What do you mean?
I'm in superb shape, ex cept for my neck.

695
01:05:46,366 --> 01:05:49,483
There's something f unny
about the way you move.

696
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:53,097
Well, I'm not aware of...
What do you mean?

697
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:54,404
Two-eighteen.

698
01:05:57,628 --> 01:06:01,018
I'd hate to see you walk
across a concert stage like that.

699
01:06:03,632 --> 01:06:04,508
Two-nineteen.

700
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:10,564
I'd get somebody to coach you
on how to walk, if I was you.

701
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:12,964
I think it's a substantial problem.

702
01:06:15,143 --> 01:06:16,462
Damn it!

703
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:19,590
Look at that.

704
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:21,500
Why are you being so mean?

705
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:23,093
Mean? I'm not being mean.

706
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,997
He does walk f unny. Don't you see that?

707
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:32,299
I don't think I'd notice.
I'm so used to Carl.

708
01:06:32,658 --> 01:06:33,613
Yeah, well...

709
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:35,062
Bobby?

710
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,760
Do you think Spicer is attractive?

711
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:44,772
I think he's got a terrific personality.

712
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:47,467
Spicer was formerly a sailor.

713
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:49,188
Look. Don't you see that?

714
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:51,456
Look at that. The guy is...

715
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,537
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

716
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:58,474
You see, there's nothing wrong
with my walk. Now, where were we?

717
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,641
At game, Carl.

718
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:11,920
Well, that's three games to Z, Carl.

719
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:14,863
What do you say about a rematch?

720
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:18,752
I thought you're going to the mainland.
You'll miss the ferry.

721
01:07:19,408 --> 01:07:23,686
Just when I was hitting my stride. Say
goodbye to Catherine for me, will you?

722
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:27,775
Can I play now?

723
01:07:28,165 --> 01:07:31,282
Tell her I'll be back sometime
tomorrow probably, will you?

724
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,672
Where is she, anyway?

725
01:07:35,005 --> 01:07:36,199
Who?

726
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:39,187
Shopping in the village.
My turn!

727
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:42,311
Why don't you and Spicer play?

728
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,119
Spicer?

729
01:08:08,868 --> 01:08:10,301
What's the matter?

730
01:08:11,078 --> 01:08:12,397
Nothing.

731
01:08:14,414 --> 01:08:15,733
Robert...

732
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:20,708
...would you do something for me?

733
01:08:23,047 --> 01:08:24,400
Would you play for me?

734
01:08:25,424 --> 01:08:27,574
Catherine, your game!

735
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:36,419
Catherine?

736
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:40,150
Will you?

737
01:11:13,322 --> 01:11:15,313
That was beautif ul. I'm surprised.

738
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:17,572
Thank you.

739
01:11:18,035 --> 01:11:19,832
I was really very moved, but...

740
01:11:22,747 --> 01:11:23,543
What's wrong?

741
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:28,466
Nothing. It's just I picked the easiest
piece that I could think of...

742
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:33,356
...and I first played it when I was 8
years old, and I played it better then.

743
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:37,325
Can't you understand it was the feeling
I was affected by?

744
01:11:37,677 --> 01:11:38,666
I didn't have any.

745
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:41,059
You had no inner feeling?

746
01:11:41,346 --> 01:11:42,540
None.

747
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:45,905
Well, then, I must
have been supplying it.

748
01:11:46,226 --> 01:11:50,014
Maybe if you supply a little more,
it might rub off on me. Who knows?

749
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,793
I doubt it.

750
01:11:53,691 --> 01:11:55,283
I could get interested.

751
01:11:56,026 --> 01:11:57,584
Well, I couldn't.

752
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:17,288
What does it have to be with you?
Grim and serious?

753
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,605
Look, you played.

754
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:23,400
I honestly responded.

755
01:12:24,009 --> 01:12:27,524
And you made me feel embarrassed
for having responded to you.

756
01:12:30,307 --> 01:12:31,535
It wasn't necessary.

757
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:35,437
Yeah, it was. I faked a little Chopin,
you faked a big response.

758
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,529
I don't think that's accurate.

759
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:41,852
All I've been getting f rom you is
meaningf ul looks at the dinner table...

760
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:44,748
...and vague suggestions about the day...

761
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,788
I am not conscious
of having given you any looks.

762
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,424
As for the day after tomorrow,
this is the day after tomorrow!

763
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:54,293
And I am, unfortunately, seeing you.

764
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,054
If you'll ex cuse me,
I'd like to take a bath.

765
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,681
-What do you want anyway?
-Some bath oil.

766
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,796
Some bath oil?

767
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,839
How about some avocado? Or this?

768
01:13:03,127 --> 01:13:05,163
Or some of this jasmine?
How about this?

769
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:06,532
What are you doing?

770
01:13:06,839 --> 01:13:10,070
What are you doing screwing around
with all this crap?

771
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:15,703
I do not find your language
very charming.

772
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:18,459
It isn't. It's direct.

773
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,408
I'd like you to leave...

774
01:13:20,726 --> 01:13:22,637
...so that I can take a bath.

775
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:24,338
Is that direct?

776
01:13:31,777 --> 01:13:32,971
Serious?

777
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:35,880
Is that what's important to you?
Serious?

778
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,195
Yes.

779
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:38,768
Let's be serious. Sit down!

780
01:13:39,033 --> 01:13:40,785
-Don't do that!
-Shut up!

781
01:13:41,661 --> 01:13:43,538
No inner feeling?

782
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:14,341
I told him the truth, finally.

783
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:18,683
He was my husband
and I loved him very much.

784
01:14:19,068 --> 01:14:23,983
But, it wasn't working any better
the second time than it did the first.

785
01:14:24,866 --> 01:14:26,504
He was a cellist.

786
01:14:26,826 --> 01:14:28,259
And there was I...

787
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:31,614
...no longer 17, looking up at him.

788
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:33,670
And I said to him:

789
01:14:33,957 --> 01:14:37,472
"Joseph, you're f ull of beans!"
And I left him.

790
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:39,788
Is that what you said to him?

791
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:41,881
Something like that.

792
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:46,386
As a matter of fact, Joseph introduced
me to Carl right around then.

793
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:49,282
How are you?

794
01:14:50,347 --> 01:14:51,905
Incredible.

795
01:14:55,184 --> 01:14:58,460
Carl restored me. He really did.

796
01:14:58,813 --> 01:15:02,488
He's much more substantial
than you give him credit for being.

797
01:15:04,776 --> 01:15:08,007
Do you think you could discreetly
move across the hall now?

798
01:15:09,114 --> 01:15:13,471
Yes, I think I could discreetly
move across the hall now.

799
01:15:25,628 --> 01:15:26,697
Robert?

800
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:33,143
I have some f ree time tomorrow morning
before Carl gets back, if you'd like.

801
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:35,689
Of course I'd like it.

802
01:15:42,392 --> 01:15:44,428
Bananas! Bananas!

803
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:06,449
You certainly do have a beautif ul piece
of real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.

804
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,774
Can he hear me?

805
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:12,916
He's not hard of hearing.

806
01:16:13,254 --> 01:16:15,131
That's a blessing at least.

807
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:21,238
This certainly is an improvement
on the motel and the coffee shop.

808
01:16:21,928 --> 01:16:24,488
How could you ever leave
such a beautif ul place?

809
01:16:24,805 --> 01:16:26,158
I don't know.

810
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,325
You've been staying
in a motel all this time?

811
01:16:30,643 --> 01:16:34,352
For two weeks there wasn't hardly
nobody there to talk to, but me.

812
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:38,898
But why did you stay at the motel?
There's plenty of room here.

813
01:16:39,276 --> 01:16:40,834
Well, I was going to...

814
01:16:41,112 --> 01:16:44,388
...but Bobby had to come up here
and feel it up here first.

815
01:16:45,323 --> 01:16:46,642
But then it took so long.

816
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:48,306
I run flat out of money.

817
01:16:48,617 --> 01:16:51,131
You didn't leave me
any number or anything, honey.

818
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:56,538
And I had to, you know,
get in a taxi and come on out here...

819
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:59,749
...in the hopes that I would not
be intruding myself.

820
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:04,504
No, not at all.
You're perfectly welcome to stay here.

821
01:17:05,258 --> 01:17:07,010
Well, thank you.

822
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:10,444
That's a very nice thing for you to say.

823
01:17:11,346 --> 01:17:12,415
Not at all.

824
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,040
You have a beautif ul head of hair.

825
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:19,130
Thank you.

826
01:17:20,312 --> 01:17:21,665
Is it natural?

827
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,891
-Rayette?
-What?

828
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,621
Just finish eating.

829
01:17:27,277 --> 01:17:28,596
Am I holding up dessert?

830
01:17:28,862 --> 01:17:31,456
No, not at all.
Take all the time you want.

831
01:17:31,989 --> 01:17:34,298
I do eat slow as a bird...

832
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:37,771
...whereas Bobby can pack it away
like a speed swing.

833
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:42,052
Is there any ketchup around?

834
01:17:42,373 --> 01:17:43,408
For God's sake!

835
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,338
Please, let's not be rude.

836
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:49,695
That's okay.
He didn't mean anything by that.

837
01:17:50,046 --> 01:17:51,445
I don't, huh?

838
01:17:56,344 --> 01:18:01,099
Bobby's just about the moodiest man
I've ever been with.

839
01:19:41,228 --> 01:19:42,502
Are you all right?

840
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:43,647
Where are you going?

841
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:46,134
To pick up some f riends
of Carl's and mine.

842
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:47,510
I wanna talk to you.

843
01:19:47,818 --> 01:19:48,694
I'll be back later.

844
01:19:48,943 --> 01:19:50,934
I wanna talk right now.
I wanna explain...

845
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:54,430
-No, it isn't necessary!
-Yes, it is!

846
01:19:54,782 --> 01:19:56,340
Come on! Move it!

847
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:57,493
Will you shut up?

848
01:19:57,742 --> 01:19:58,538
Come on!

849
01:19:58,785 --> 01:20:00,696
This is impossible. I have to go!

850
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:02,755
Will you just wait one minute?

851
01:20:04,999 --> 01:20:07,354
I haven't been being fair to Carl.

852
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,860
I have to tell you that.

853
01:20:11,588 --> 01:20:13,260
What? I can't hear you!

854
01:20:15,216 --> 01:20:18,174
I'm sorry everything's
been so conf using.

855
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:20,900
I'll see you later this evening.

856
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:32,157
You see, man is born into the world with
his existent adversary f rom the first.

857
01:20:32,564 --> 01:20:35,032
It is his historic, mythic inheritance.

858
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:37,998
Is this startling?
Aggression is prehistoric.

859
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,311
An organism behaves
according to its nature...

860
01:20:40,655 --> 01:20:43,772
...which derives f rom the circumstances
of its inheritance.

861
01:20:44,117 --> 01:20:47,951
Fact remains that primitive man took
delight in tearing his adversary apart.

862
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:51,885
That is where, I think,
the core of the problem resides.

863
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,047
Doesn't that seem apocalyptic?

864
01:20:55,001 --> 01:20:56,593
I do not make poetry.

865
01:20:57,044 --> 01:20:58,841
Is there a TV in the house?

866
01:21:01,758 --> 01:21:02,986
I remarked to John...

867
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:06,808
...that rationality is not
a device to alter facts.

868
01:21:07,178 --> 01:21:10,250
I think of it
as an extraneous tool, a gadget...

869
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,318
...somewhat like the television.

870
01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:16,282
To look at it any other way
is ridiculous.

871
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:18,481
There's some good things on it.

872
01:21:19,856 --> 01:21:20,766
I beg your pardon?

873
01:21:21,025 --> 01:21:23,823
The TV. There's some
good things on it sometimes.

874
01:21:24,152 --> 01:21:28,304
I have strong doubts.
Nevertheless, I am not discussing media.

875
01:21:28,698 --> 01:21:30,097
But there is always hope.

876
01:21:30,367 --> 01:21:32,358
-For the few.
-What about love?

877
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,490
What about it?

878
01:21:34,036 --> 01:21:38,552
Wouldn't you say that more ill has been
done f rom love than f rom abomination?

879
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:40,884
No. No, I wouldn't.

880
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:44,527
Well, you are a romantic, Catherine.

881
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,876
And once more about to be married.

882
01:21:47,172 --> 01:21:48,525
So you can be ex cused...

883
01:21:48,841 --> 01:21:51,275
...f rom objective discussions.
But ask Carl.

884
01:21:51,593 --> 01:21:55,472
Ask him if even the institution
of marriage is completely f ree f rom it.

885
01:21:55,846 --> 01:21:56,995
Ask him.

886
01:21:57,307 --> 01:22:02,142
I think these cold,
objective discussions are aggressive.

887
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:03,471
Ex cuse me.

888
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:04,684
That's reactive!

889
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,790
If I may say, without dampening
the spirit of your adventure...

890
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:11,107
You haven't dampened my spirit.

891
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:12,994
-Ex cuse me.
-I should hope not.

892
01:22:13,278 --> 01:22:17,430
But it's still open to some dispute that
there seems to be less aggression...

893
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:19,585
...or violence, if you like...

894
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,105
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.

895
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:23,810
...and loftier natures...

896
01:22:24,121 --> 01:22:26,077
What kind of doggy is this?

897
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,887
This is a Border collie.

898
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:31,603
I had a pussycat once.
It was a little fluffy thing.

899
01:22:32,003 --> 01:22:35,154
Bobby gave it to me. Remember, Bobby?

900
01:22:35,924 --> 01:22:38,119
The little pussycat you gave me?

901
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,625
Yeah.

902
01:22:40,178 --> 01:22:42,487
Had two little white f ront paws.

903
01:22:42,846 --> 01:22:45,314
And I was crazy after her.

904
01:22:45,683 --> 01:22:47,560
We left it at some f riends' house...

905
01:22:47,893 --> 01:22:51,522
...and she got squashed flat
as a tortilla outside their mobile home.

906
01:22:51,895 --> 01:22:53,886
There! Do you see what I mean?

907
01:22:54,774 --> 01:22:58,926
The choice of words juxtaposed
with the image of a fluffy kitten!

908
01:22:59,361 --> 01:23:03,354
The enchantment of words,
"squashed, " "flat, " etcetera...

909
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,537
Well, she was.

910
01:23:05,825 --> 01:23:08,703
Perhaps. But it was just
what I was trying to point out.

911
01:23:09,036 --> 01:23:10,515
Don't sit there pointing at her.

912
01:23:11,412 --> 01:23:12,322
I beg your pardon?

913
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:14,651
I said, don't point at her, you creep!

914
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:15,993
But I was just...

915
01:23:16,251 --> 01:23:20,881
Where do you get the ass to tell anybody
about class or what she typifies?

916
01:23:21,339 --> 01:23:23,807
You shouldn't even be
in the same room with her!

917
01:23:24,175 --> 01:23:25,403
This is really too much.

918
01:23:25,676 --> 01:23:27,906
-Just calm down!
-You're f ull of shit!

919
01:23:29,512 --> 01:23:31,343
You're all f ull of shit!

920
01:23:35,309 --> 01:23:36,503
Catherine!

921
01:23:44,234 --> 01:23:45,428
Catherine?

922
01:23:57,162 --> 01:23:59,722
I can't talk to you.
Leave me alone.

923
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:05,225
What the hell's going on?

924
01:24:05,544 --> 01:24:07,375
-What're you doing?
-What's...

925
01:24:07,713 --> 01:24:09,704
Hey, where...
Where's Catherine?

926
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:12,237
I don't know where Catherine is!

927
01:24:13,593 --> 01:24:15,072
I'm talking to you, Tita!

928
01:24:15,344 --> 01:24:18,575
I told you just to take
your hands off my sister, nurse!

929
01:24:18,931 --> 01:24:20,205
Move out!

930
01:24:20,516 --> 01:24:21,471
Stop it!

931
01:24:22,309 --> 01:24:23,981
Stop it! Stop it!

932
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:25,629
Hold it, will you?

933
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:28,090
Hold it! Take it easy!

934
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:30,343
Take it easy, will you?

935
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,880
Stop it! Let him go!

936
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,408
You give up?

937
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,466
Do you give up? Do you?

938
01:24:41,784 --> 01:24:43,376
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

939
01:24:43,702 --> 01:24:44,930
-Give up?
-Stop!

940
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,476
Give up! Give up! Give up!

941
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:53,612
Bobby!

942
01:25:02,886 --> 01:25:05,002
I just wanted to talk to you.

943
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:11,489
It's useless.

944
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:15,637
Look, give me a chance.

945
01:25:15,982 --> 01:25:18,257
I'm trying to be delicate with you...

946
01:25:18,608 --> 01:25:21,042
...but you just won't understand.

947
01:25:21,653 --> 01:25:25,885
I couldn't go with you. Not because
of Carl, but because of you.

948
01:25:30,369 --> 01:25:33,122
You're a strange person, Robert.

949
01:25:35,415 --> 01:25:37,326
I mean, what would it come to?

950
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,919
A person who has no love for himself,
no respect for himself...

951
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:47,458
...no love of his f riends,
family, work, something.

952
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,443
How can he ask for love in return?

953
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,359
Why should he ask for it?

954
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,729
Living here in this rest-home asylum,
that's what you want?

955
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:01,344
Yes.

956
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:03,603
That'll make you happy?

957
01:26:04,941 --> 01:26:06,852
I hope it will. Yes.

958
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:14,256
I'm sorry.

959
01:26:45,268 --> 01:26:46,462
Okay.

960
01:27:06,037 --> 01:27:07,436
Are you cold?

961
01:27:27,305 --> 01:27:29,136
I don't know if you'd be...

962
01:27:29,474 --> 01:27:32,989
...particularly interested
in hearing anything about me.

963
01:27:34,228 --> 01:27:37,459
My life, I mean.
Most of it doesn't add up to much...

964
01:27:37,815 --> 01:27:42,047
...that I could relate as a way
of life that you'd approve of.

965
01:27:44,071 --> 01:27:46,187
I move around a lot.

966
01:27:47,907 --> 01:27:51,536
Not because I'm looking
for anything, really...

967
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,398
...but because I'm getting away
f rom things that get bad...

968
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:59,551
...if I stay.

969
01:28:01,753 --> 01:28:04,267
Auspicious beginnings,
you know what I mean?

970
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,255
I'm trying to imagine you're...

971
01:28:22,813 --> 01:28:25,373
...you're half of this conversation.

972
01:28:28,484 --> 01:28:30,793
My feeling is, I don't know...

973
01:28:32,029 --> 01:28:35,942
...that if you could talk,
we wouldn't be talking.

974
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:42,214
It's pretty much the way
that it got to be before I left.

975
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:47,326
Are you all right?

976
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:53,745
I don't know what to say.

977
01:29:00,304 --> 01:29:02,420
Tita suggested that we try to...

978
01:29:02,765 --> 01:29:03,914
I don't know.

979
01:29:04,224 --> 01:29:06,260
I think that she feels...

980
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:09,287
I think that she feels that we've got...

981
01:29:09,646 --> 01:29:12,285
...some understanding to reach.

982
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,498
She totally denies the fact...

983
01:29:17,778 --> 01:29:22,010
...that we were never that comfortable
with one another to begin with.

984
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:37,090
The best that I can do is apologize.

985
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,969
We both know that I was never
really that good at it anyway.

986
01:29:54,185 --> 01:29:56,301
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

987
01:30:03,527 --> 01:30:04,721
Bobby!

988
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:07,792
You're leaving?

989
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:11,469
Yeah. I said a week.
I think I overstayed myself.

990
01:30:11,825 --> 01:30:14,385
You were going without
saying goodbye to me.

991
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:17,345
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.

992
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,097
But what about me?

993
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:23,814
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

994
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,399
Oh, Robert!

995
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,197
Watch the birdie!

996
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,040
Bye.

997
01:30:38,682 --> 01:30:39,478
Come on, Ray.

998
01:30:39,724 --> 01:30:42,682
I want to take a picture
of us in f ront of the place.

999
01:30:43,061 --> 01:30:44,255
Not now, Ray.

1000
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:49,040
Listen, I never got to
thank you all for your hospitality.

1001
01:30:49,442 --> 01:30:54,357
Tell Carl if any of you wanna come to
our place, you'll be more than welcome.

1002
01:30:56,614 --> 01:30:58,047
Bye, now.

1003
01:31:17,134 --> 01:31:21,127
Your kiss is like a drink

1004
01:31:22,346 --> 01:31:25,144
When I am thirsty

1005
01:31:26,975 --> 01:31:31,890
Oh, and I'm thirsty for you

1006
01:31:33,355 --> 01:31:35,915
With all my heart

1007
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:42,057
But don't love me then pretend

1008
01:31:42,822 --> 01:31:46,098
As though we've never kissed

1009
01:31:48,244 --> 01:31:50,155
Don't touch me

1010
01:31:58,252 --> 01:32:00,163
Don't touch me

1011
01:32:11,055 --> 01:32:12,488
Cut it out!

1012
01:32:13,266 --> 01:32:15,177
Son of a bitch, Bobby!

1013
01:32:15,476 --> 01:32:17,706
You quit pushing me away like that!

1014
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:21,372
I've had enough of that
to last me an entire lifetime!

1015
01:32:22,148 --> 01:32:24,946
Why don't you just
be good to me for a change?

1016
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:36,375
There isn't anybody gonna look
after you and love you as good as I do.

1017
01:32:43,084 --> 01:32:44,802
Did you hear me?

1018
01:32:45,085 --> 01:32:46,279
Baby?

1019
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,312
I'm going to that café for some coffee.

1020
01:33:13,944 --> 01:33:15,662
You want anything?

1021
01:33:19,366 --> 01:33:20,481
No.

1022
01:33:20,742 --> 01:33:22,334
You got any change?

1023
01:33:31,335 --> 01:33:33,166
You don't have any change?

1024
01:33:45,347 --> 01:33:47,736
Sure you don't want anything?

1025
01:33:49,309 --> 01:33:50,708
Fill it up, will you?

1026
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:35,394
Hey, wait!

1027
01:35:58,673 --> 01:36:00,982
Don't you got a jacket
or anything with you?

1028
01:36:01,509 --> 01:36:02,703
No.

1029
01:36:03,052 --> 01:36:04,246
Jesus!

1030
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,039
Got burned up.

1031
01:36:06,304 --> 01:36:09,501
Everything in the car
got the shit burned out of it.

1032
01:36:10,058 --> 01:36:10,888
Everything.

1033
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:13,139
All I got is what I got on.

1034
01:36:13,436 --> 01:36:15,666
I got one behind the seat
if you want it.

1035
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,493
No, it's okay.

1036
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:19,396
Suit yourself.

1037
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,048
Tell you one thing.

1038
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:24,036
Where we're going
it's gonna get colder than hell.

1039
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:25,597
That's okay.

1040
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:28,183
I'm fine.

1041
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,894
I'm fine.
