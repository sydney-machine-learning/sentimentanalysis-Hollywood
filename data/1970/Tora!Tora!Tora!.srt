1
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,194
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief
isn't the coward they say he is.

2
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,650
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is
the kind of leader we need.

3
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,881
He believes in the value
of the airplane.

4
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,322
But why a Vice-Navy Minister
for such an important position?

5
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:13,841
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was
detrimental to Yamamoto's health.

6
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:19,370
The Army is against him for
opposing their policies.

7
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:26,513
So he runs away to sea. Now he
has the entire fleet to guard him.

8
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,290
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.

9
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,617
The Imperial fleet consists of...

10
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,950
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.

11
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,120
You haven't changed!

12
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,500
With the Army controlling politics...

13
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,960
...your job as Navy Minister
will be difficult.

14
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,930
Thank God you're here.

15
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,890
We know your life
has been threatened.

16
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm not that easy to kill.

17
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:25,560
Army hotheads are demanding
an alliance with Germany.

18
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,780
That would be tragic for Japan.

19
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,247
As Navy Minister I will...

20
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,700
...continue to fight with the Army.

21
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,660
You are our last hope, Yoshida.

22
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,830
The Navy must stand firm
against the alliance.

23
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,850
America is against the war
we are waging in China...

24
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:05,051
...and angry that we are
negotiating with the Germans.

25
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,831
Now we are threatened with an embargo
of the raw materials we need.

26
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:16,643
Either we improve relations with the U.S.
and withdraw from China...

27
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,461
...or find another source of
raw materials here in Indo-China.

28
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,000
Why worry about threats
from America?

29
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:31,624
President Rooseveltâ€™s attention
is on Europe...

30
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:36,183
...where Germany is winning a
quick victory over the Allied Armies.

31
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,704
Now is the time to strike.

32
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:49,492
The British, the Dutch and the French
are withdrawing their forces...

33
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,373
...from Southeast Asia to
strengthen their armies in Europe.

34
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,931
We must be careful.

35
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,078
The Americans have an Army
in the Philippines...

36
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:14,760
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.

37
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:24,038
Yes, and that fleet is a knife
leveled at Japan's throat.

38
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,940
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.

39
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,650
Thank you.

40
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,900
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.

41
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900
You know that.

42
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,330
When Nomura took over as ambassador...

43
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,660
...I had some hopes of settling
our differences.

44
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,830
But our meetings so far
have been unproductive.

45
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,500
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.

46
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,300
He brings me counterproposals,
and so on.

47
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,350
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.

48
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,930
That's what he's doing,
at our expense.

49
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,230
The president believes him
to be a man of honor...

50
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,150
...that we can trust and deal with.

51
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,190
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.

52
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,860
It is always a pleasure.

53
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,830
I assume you know Mr. Stimson,
the head of our War Department.

54
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh, yes, of course.

55
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,370
Mr. Ambassador.

56
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,750
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...

57
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,515
...your presence here
does not indicate anything ominous.

58
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,090
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.

59
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,260
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?

60
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,010
Thank you.

61
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,230
Well, since our last talk
a week ago...

62
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,730
...I have received certain...

63
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,230
...shall we say...

64
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,286
...questions from my government...

65
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:43,610
...to put to you
to clarify certain matters.

66
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,800
Good morning, Colonel.

67
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,810
There it is.

68
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,610
This machine let's us intercept
every word between Tokyo...

69
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,642
...and all Japanese embassies.

70
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,030
The coded material is fed
into that machine.

71
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,950
It goes round and round in there...

72
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,708
...and comes out here,
decoded in Japanese.

73
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,460
All we have to do is translate it.

74
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,510
We decode this quicker than
the Japanese embassy...

75
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,470
...right here in Washington.

76
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,350
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."

77
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,270
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.

78
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Things are getting a little
hotter in the Pacific.

79
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,460
As long as we're sharing
this assignment...

80
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,170
...take a look at this.

81
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,296
Behold the 12 apostles.

82
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,560
The chosen few are authorized
to see the magic intercepts.

83
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,890
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps,
isn't on the list.

84
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,980
No, and not one of our
overseas commanders.

85
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,440
Excellent!

86
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,989
Who is in command of
those torpedo planes?

87
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:38,082
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir,
from the carrier Akagi.

88
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:41,655
Send him this message from me.

89
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,717
"Congratulations on brilliant
torpedo attack."

90
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:08,280
If we are forced into
a war with America...

91
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,150
...Japan's only hope...

92
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,830
...is to annihilate the American Pacific
fleet at the outset.

93
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:20,910
I wonder if we could use
torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?

94
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,840
Stand by.

95
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,100
Execute.

96
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,950
Look at that entrance to the harbor.

97
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,870
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel
and you've bottled up our whole fleet.

98
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,800
You know as well as I do,
this harbor is a mousetrap.

99
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,970
Fleet should have stayed
in San Diego where it belongs.

100
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,640
I made the mistake to point
that out to Roosevelt.

101
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,084
We're expected to obey orders.

102
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,900
We're also expected to exercise
our own good judgement.

103
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,567
I didn't ask for the job.

104
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,070
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command,
and it's become habit...

105
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,020
...to worry about the security
of the fleet.

106
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,040
The British, flying some
old biplanes...

107
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,500
...torpedoed and sank three Italian
battleships at Taranto.

108
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,540
- Harbor very much like this one.
- Well...

109
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,590
...I share your concern, but CNO
doesn't think it can happen here.

110
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,140
Why not?

111
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,499
A torpedo dropped
from a plane plunges...

112
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,260
...to a depth of 75 feet or more
before it levels off.

113
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,560
I know, and Pearl is only
40 feet deep.

114
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,647
I'm still worried, Kim.

115
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:21,700
Frankly, sir, I was stunned
when I heard of your proposal.

116
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,370
You think the plan is reckless?

117
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:28,723
You suggest using torpedo planes
against the American Fleet...

118
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,357
...but Pearl Harbor is
too shallow for that.

119
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,550
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...

120
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:38,871
...but the British torpedoed and sank
three Italian battleships there.

121
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,890
I know as well as you do
that my plan is a gamble.

122
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:48,607
And it's risky,
but we have no choice.

123
00:17:49,454 --> 00:17:52,770
What I need immediately is
a plan for such an attack.

124
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,961
Then we should consult with Genda...

125
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:04,410
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi,
a superb strategist.

126
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,750
Yes, I remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.

127
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,823
Glad to see you, Genda.

128
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,342
So this is the new Zero?

129
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,458
Type 21, with folding wings.

130
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,130
This means we can carry
more fighters now.

131
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,652
This Zero is fast, manoeuvrable
and has a long cruising range.

132
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,286
Better than the Messerschmitt
or Spitfire?

133
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,952
Definitely. I've seen both
in combat over London.

134
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,632
You outrank me, so it must be true.

135
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,690
Now that you're Staff Officer here,
things will be tough.

136
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,563
You don't have to worry,
you won't be here.

137
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:24,870
You're going to the Third Fleet
with a promotion.

138
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,997
The Commander-in-Chief
must think you're good!

139
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,067
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!

140
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,801
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?

141
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,280
Ten-hut!

142
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,837
Do the planes have to be
parked like that?

143
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,920
Way at the edge of the field.

144
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,130
Standard dispersal procedure, General.

145
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,930
In case of enemy air attack.

146
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,510
There are 130,000 Japanese
on this island.

147
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,810
Our main problem is sabotage.

148
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,361
It'd be too easy for enemies
to sneak in at night...

149
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,150
...and blow up every one of them
if they're left out there.

150
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,661
Make a note, Fielder.
We'll have to make changes.

151
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,900
Yes, sir.

152
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,740
Ten-hut.

153
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,830
- Yes?
- Admiral Halsey's here to see you.

154
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,670
Send him in, please.

155
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,301
Blast me, break me, court-martial me,
draw and quarter me...

156
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:06,010
...if you think they're gonna
send my ships...

157
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,615
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.

158
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,810
Kim, I think they've
gone nuts in Washington.

159
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,550
How will I fight
a task force if they send ...

160
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,091
...my ships to the Atlantic?

161
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:20,440
That damn ocean is a swimming hole
compared to the Pacific.

162
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,193
What are we, a fighting fleet,
or are these toy boats out here...

163
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,781
...so the Japs
can buy them at Christmas?

164
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,330
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.

165
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,700
They asked for some
of our tankers too.

166
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,456
How do they expect to feed
these wagons...

167
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,590
...parked out here on
this land-locked duck pond?

168
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,710
You're still planning on rotating
half of them at sea?

169
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:45,191
I was.

170
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:49,640
Look, Kim, you've got to make them
understand what's going on out here.

171
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,680
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.

172
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,646
Even go to the president.

173
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,302
By God, I knew there was
at least one man...

174
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,893
...in this man's Navy
who hadn't gone nuts.

175
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:48,190
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.

176
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,633
A strange man, he works in his
cabin like a hermit.

177
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,245
But he should be here.

178
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,216
Watanabe, go and ask him
to join us.

179
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:09,592
When "Gandhi" concentrates on
a plan, he is lost to this world.

180
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:19,900
Please don't bother me!
This is important...

181
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,527
...so I'm not going.

182
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,820
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...

183
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,821
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!

184
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:36,600
He stresses the importance
of combat aircraft.

185
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,808
Just think of it.

186
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,345
We use six aircraft carriers...

187
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:53,277
...torpedo planes...

188
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,760
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.

189
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,577
Zero fighters for cover...

190
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:06,152
...go by the northern route,
use the new torpedoes...

191
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,650
...we attack on a weekend.

192
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,163
Genda has thought of everything...

193
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,120
...refuelling...

194
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,853
...the weather....

195
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:34,089
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan ...

196
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:38,470
...has never preceded hostile action
by a declaration of war.

197
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,544
We have concluded it possible
that a fast-rated ...

198
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,782
...Japanese carrier force may arrive
in Hawaii with no prior warning...

199
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
...from our intelligence service.

200
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,400
The most favourable time
to the enemy would be dawn.

201
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,820
He probably would employ
a maximum of six carriers...

202
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,780
...strike on a weekend.

203
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:59,275
- We recommend that the Air Corps..."
- I read it.

204
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,790
Yes, sir.

205
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,438
I appreciate the work that you
and General Martin have put in.

206
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,260
These reports are very useful
to General Short and myself.

207
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,510
General Martin, you don't pull
any punches, do you?

208
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,313
"We recommend that the Air Corps...

209
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,314
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...

210
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,060
...of the Hawaiian area
during daylight.

211
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,280
This will require a force of
180 B-17 airplanes."

212
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,027
We can't search the sea approaches...

213
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:39,620
...unless we have the planes, sir.

214
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,870
One hundred and eighty B-17s?

215
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,380
For God's sakes, that's more than
the number existing in the States.

216
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,800
It looks fine on paper, but that's
not a paper fleet out there.

217
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,130
Squadron from the Enterprise.

218
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,800
Bill Halsey's working
the tails off his men.

219
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,100
Wish we had more like him.

220
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,526
Makes the most of what he's got.

221
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,560
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.

222
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:32,500
Well, not one bomb anywhere
near the target for the past hour.

223
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,300
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.

224
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,180
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.

225
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,190
Now, that's more like it.

226
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,480
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- I hope so, sir.

227
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,110
Who's next?

228
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,700
Lieutenant Dickenson.

229
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...

230
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,385
...he couldn't hit a bull
in the butt with a bass fiddle.

231
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,965
Yes, sir.

232
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,340
Ten-hut.

233
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,520
- Carry on.
- Carry on.

234
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:33,804
This it?

235
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:35,719
Yes, sir. Our new radar.

236
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:38,150
It's a remarkable
scientific achievement...

237
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,771
...capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air...

238
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,089
...and at quite a range.

239
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,410
- Now, listen, Colonel,
as you know, we're short on patrol planes.

240
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,250
We're gonna have to rely on this...

241
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,260
...thing to detect the enemy.

242
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,170
General, radar should do the job.

243
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,231
What's it doing here, not set up?

244
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,590
We're about to truck it up
that mountain.

245
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,905
That peak up there is the ideal spot
to put our main radar post.

246
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:09,067
At that height, we'd be clear
of all interference.

247
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,600
Obviously.

248
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,560
But, sir, we can't get permission
to put her up there.

249
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:16,626
Permission?

250
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,421
From the National Park Service
Department of Interior.

251
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:23,740
See, all of this belongs
to the Hawaiian National Park.

252
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,110
The Hawaiian National Park?

253
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,631
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.

254
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,540
And we can't get permission?

255
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,960
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.

256
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,050
Fight them? You're damn right
we're gonna fight them.

257
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,590
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,300
Wildlife Preservation Society.

259
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,991
I feel like a damn fool.

260
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,221
Without even consulting me...

261
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,610
...our Army has decided
to occupy Indo-China.

262
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,537
There is no hope for peace now.

263
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:15,431
I've said it before
and Iâ€™ll keep on saying it...

264
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,590
...if we fight the Americans, we can't
stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.

265
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:22,166
We'll have to march
into Washington...

266
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:26,312
...and dictate peace terms
in the White House!

267
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:33,185
Army hotheads who speak so lightly
of war should think about that!

268
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:40,217
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.

269
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,563
I'm sorry.

270
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:52,015
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.

271
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,132
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.

272
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,035
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.

273
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,097
He took it up with General Marshall.

274
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:15,220
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra List.

275
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,140
Incredible.

276
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,520
Withholding information
from the president.

277
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,610
Security found a copy of an intercept
in a wastebasket at the White House.

278
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:30,360
Truth is, the brass don't trust some
men close to the president.

279
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:32,951
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?

280
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,273
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?

281
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:41,250
Come to think of it, I believe I do.

282
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,909
Part two of No. 1390, Colonel.

283
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,360
Tokyo to embassies
in Washington and Berlin.

284
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:49,050
Thank you, Miss Cave.

285
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:57,230
The Japanese are moving south
to occupy French Indo-China.

286
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,940
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.

287
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,780
Well, ultra list or not...

288
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:08,950
...someone has to tell
the president about this one.

289
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,591
"Therefore, we will impose
a full embargo...

290
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,960
...on all trade with Japan.

291
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,471
We do not anticipate immediate
hostile action by Japan...

292
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,189
...but you get this information...

293
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,610
...so you may take appropriate
precautionary measures."

294
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,948
"Appropriate precautionary measures."

295
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,674
What the hell does that mean?

296
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,570
Now, this is signed jointly
by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.

297
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,570
Until we know how the Japanese will
react, we're not gonna take chances.

298
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,830
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.

299
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,500
Stark says they don't anticipate
hostile action.

300
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Why send a warning at all?

301
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,960
Damn it.

302
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,760
Damn it, why can't Washington
give us the full inside story?

303
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,600
I'd sooner form my own opinion.

304
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,994
"Don't anticipate hostile action."

305
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,190
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.

306
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,860
Increase air and sub patrols,
alert senior commanders.

307
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,082
Maybe out of this we can find out
how well we can function.

308
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,830
Kaminsky.

309
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,210
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.

310
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:47,880
Yes, captain.

311
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,780
We're going on full alert.

312
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,880
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.

313
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,100
What the hell is going on here?

314
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,753
What are you doing?

315
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,258
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.

316
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,142
All aircraft not ready
for flight from now on...

317
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,412
...will be parked in the center...

318
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,314
...so they can be kept under guard.

319
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,963
Suppose there's an air raid.

320
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,964
They hit one plane, and it all
goes up in flames.

321
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,552
I'm sorry. General's orders.

322
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,193
Today's war games...

323
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,683
...of a theoretical attack
on Pearl Harbor...

324
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:04,260
...clearly show the need for
six carriers in the attack force.

325
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,617
The General Staff...

326
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,977
...wants to limit us to only
three carriers.

327
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,978
We must have six!

328
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,900
If we reduce our striking force...

329
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,870
...from six carriers to only three...

330
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,355
...our mission will fail.

331
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:30,777
Before attacking anything else,
we should attack our General Staff.

332
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,847
We believe in aircraft,
but they cling to the ancient theory...

333
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,735
...that decisive naval engagements
must be fought between battleships.

334
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,470
Unless we dispel this myth...

335
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,706
...we'll never get their approval.

336
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,287
They are not the only believers
in the "battleship theory."

337
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,648
Many officers here today
also support the idea.

338
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,764
I'm one of them. We'll soon have
two new unsinkable battlewagons...

339
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,758
...each with a displacement of
65,000 tons and huge guns.

340
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,614
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.

341
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,340
The war in Europe is being
decided by the airplane.

342
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,010
There can be no Î½ictory on land or sea,
without control of the air!

343
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,068
I have been chosen to command
this task force.

344
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,890
And I consider this operation risky.

345
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,185
How can we travel 3500 miles
to Hawaii without being detected?

346
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:36,560
This mission will fail unless
we achieve complete surprise.

347
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,477
My ships can't carry fuel
for a trip there and back.

348
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:44,196
Stopping to refuel increases
the possibility of detection.

349
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:51,848
I am confident that our ships
will reach Hawaii safely.

350
00:36:52,535 --> 00:36:56,880
You are too cautious. The case
for using six carriers is sound.

351
00:36:57,162 --> 00:37:00,667
To criticize the plan is defeatist!

352
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:24,789
No more bickering! As long
as I am Commander-in-Chief...

353
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,950
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!

354
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,144
I am aware that this is
a dangerous gamble.

355
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,167
But we can't afford the luxury
of playing it safe now!

356
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:49,510
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this
plan or not is no longer an issue.

357
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:54,478
Let us now decide how best
to carry it out.

358
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,080
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!

359
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,213
Fuchida! What a surprise!

360
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,550
I'm your new Air Commander,
so treat me well.

361
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,130
You're joking. How did you
rate another promotion?

362
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,060
Well, exceptional people get
exceptional treatment!

363
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,171
This ship is crawling with Admirals.

364
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:50,623
Something important
must be happening.

365
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,200
We have called you here...

366
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,080
...to explain the purpose of
a new training program.

367
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,741
This, of course, is a matter
of strictest secrecy.

368
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,260
It looks just like Pearl Harbor,
doesn't it?

369
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,050
And that area down there
looks like Ford island, eh?

370
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,090
Beautiful!

371
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,486
Navy pilots attract geisha girls
but they frighten the fish.

372
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:18,300
It's not an ideal radar sight,
but at least we got a permit.

373
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,390
Let's get the other units working.

374
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,890
Easier said than done.

375
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,140
What do you mean?

376
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,770
We have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters.

377
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
That means training men to operate
an information center...

378
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,570
...so they know what to do
with the information.

379
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,150
Take it easy, Murph.

380
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,330
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

381
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,910
Don't just stand there.

382
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,040
You know how to operate this thing.

383
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,250
We know the theory.

384
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Let's put that theory into practice.

385
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,340
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,430
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

387
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,390
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

388
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,430
Excuse me, sir,
but what are we watching for?

389
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,810
Anything unusual.

390
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,230
Any large blip coming from the sea.

391
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,230
Colonel, if we do spot something,
what do we do?

392
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,030
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

393
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,570
- How, sir?
- What?

394
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,610
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

395
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,080
There's a gas station
a mile down the road.

396
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,740
They must have a phone.

397
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,930
We got 183 combat planes
on this base, General.

398
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,492
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon...

399
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,060
...could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade.

400
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,015
General Short gave the order.

401
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:50,730
Come in.

402
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,860
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.

403
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,884
You two men get in your planes
and fly over to Haleiwa.

404
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,500
Yes, sir.

405
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,670
What are our orders when we get there?

406
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,750
Just sit tight.

407
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,380
Listen for the phone. That's all.

408
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,880
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

409
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,020
Haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields.

410
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,900
We send those two up there,
two more here.

411
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,020
Only way I know to disperse
a few of the planes.

412
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,780
If I'd get away with it, I'd send
all to the neighbour islands.

413
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,040
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.

414
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,410
- Been winning too often.
- Yeah.

415
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,170
Some sucker loses his shirt,
so he bitches to the General.

416
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,380
That's it.

417
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,970
It's hard to believe
the Emperor agreed...

418
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,695
...to fix a date by which the
final decision must be made...

419
00:44:05,994 --> 00:44:07,628
...between war and peace.

420
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:12,060
His majesty's signature
is a mere formality.

421
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,360
The cabinet is responsible for
all matters of national policy.

422
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:23,450
The Emperor recently read a poem
to his Ministers to show how he feels.

423
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,870
"If all people are brethren...

424
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,250
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

425
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:38,710
"If all people are brethren...

426
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,590
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

427
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:50,869
This clearly shows how much
the Emperor wants to avoid a war.

428
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:57,889
Yes, he has urged us to solve our
differences with Washington.

429
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,872
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?

430
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:06,933
Perhaps. But if we fail...

431
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,740
...if war does come...

432
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,120
...tell me frankly,
from the Navy's Viewpoint...

433
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,460
...what are our chances
against the Americans?

434
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:23,962
If we must, we can raise havoc
with them for a year.

435
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,736
After that, I can guarantee nothing.

436
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,770
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you
will continue the negotiations.

437
00:45:36,596 --> 00:45:39,310
Please remember, there is
no last word in diplomacy.

438
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,252
Tokyo has ignored
my repeated inquiries...

439
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:02,486
...and still has made no reply...

440
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,340
...to the compromise proposals
offered by Secretary Hull.

441
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,874
The war that I have dreaded
for so long...

442
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,570
...may soon become a reality.

443
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:30,424
Nomura has offered
his resignation several times.

444
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,048
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

445
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,620
Instead they're sending a second
ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.

446
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,300
Do you really think
this Kurusu can do any good?

447
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,220
Well, I doubt it, Frank.

448
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,800
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

449
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,180
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

450
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,220
...he signed the Axis Pact
on behalf of Japan.

451
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,150
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay
on November 26 under my strict orders.

452
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,730
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka"
will be confirmation to go on.

453
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,180
We have tentatively set
the date for the attack...

454
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,580
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.

455
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:23,331
But you must understand that we
are still negotiating in Washington.

456
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,795
If a peaceful solution is found...

457
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:30,930
...the fleet will be recalled at once.

458
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,223
Once at sea, to turn back
would be a disgrace!

459
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,900
It would destroy the morale of the men!

460
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:48,139
They're in a high state of readiness,
physically and psychologically.

461
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,498
Enough! If any commander is inclined
to reject an order to return...

462
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:56,769
...when the path for peace is open...

463
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:00,635
...let him resign now!

464
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,680
Finally, gentlemen...

465
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,430
...many misinformed Japanese...

466
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:22,980
...believe that America is a
nation divided, isolationist...

467
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:27,560
...and that Americans are
only interested...

468
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,749
...in enjoying a life of Luxury...

469
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,490
...and are spiritually
and morally corrupt.

470
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,740
But that is a great mistake.

471
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,830
If war becomes inevitable...

472
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:50,803
...America would be the most formidable
foe that we have ever fought.

473
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,640
I've lived in Washington
and studied at Harvard...

474
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,749
...so I know the Americans are
a proud and just people.

475
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,360
- You sick or something?
- No.

476
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,780
I've been piecing together this
batch of new intercepts.

477
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,790
- A frightening picture is taking shape.
- Oh?

478
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,460
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu
asked their government...

479
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,630
...to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between Japan and America.

480
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,670
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

481
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,890
Now, according to this latest
intercept...

482
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,640
...Tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us...

483
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,810
...no later than November 29...

484
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,560
...after which, and I quote:

485
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,520
"Things are automatically
going to happen."

486
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,070
Now...

487
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,200
...look at this intelligence report
from the British.

488
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,330
Five Japanese troop transports
with naval escort...

489
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,910
...were sighted off Formosa,
heading south.

490
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,380
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

491
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,710
I'm not so sure.

492
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,350
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.

493
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,560
Japan is going to attack us.

494
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,060
The 29th is only four days off.

495
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,780
The 30th is on a Sunday.

496
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,530
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday,
the 30th of November.

497
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,250
The pieces fit together.

498
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,460
But can you prove it?

499
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,630
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.

500
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,760
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.

501
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:03,930
Oh, General Marshall's
at Fort Benning, sir.

502
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,811
Then get me the secretary of war.

503
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,093
I've got the evidence, AI.

504
00:51:14,543 --> 00:51:17,972
And I'm gonna make the brass
around here admit I'm right.

505
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:30,580
Bratton's analysis makes sense.

506
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,420
His facts are undeniable.

507
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:41,510
Henry, I'm washing my hands
of the whole matter.

508
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,260
From now on, it's in your hands...

509
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,180
...and in those
of the Navy Department.

510
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,509
I'll call the president.

511
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,210
A message declaring a full alert
will be sent out.

512
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,670
Sir?

513
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,670
General Marshall anticipated
an emergency like this.

514
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,090
Before he left to attend manoeuvres...

515
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,340
...he made out this alert order.

516
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,210
As you know, after the Cabinet
decided to send Japan to war...

517
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,590
...they held an Imperial Conference
at the palace.

518
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,260
His Majesty, who participated
in this conference...

519
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,680
...which is a mere formality...

520
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,600
...was depressed and silent
all through the meeting.

521
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:18,190
Today His Majesty will ask
the customary questions about the war...

522
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,360
...and you will make
the traditional replies.

523
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,490
There can be no more tragic ritual
than this conversation...

524
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,290
...between His Majesty
who does not want war...

525
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:34,160
...and Your Excellency,
who has opposed it so vigorously.

526
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,500
As Minister of the Imperial Household...

527
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,800
...I am not allowed to attend this ritual.

528
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,800
Fortunately for me...

529
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,140
...I won't have to witness
this tragic ceremony.

530
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,980
I can go no farther.

531
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,780
The Military AttachÃ© will
take you from here.

532
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,900
Sir, a message!

533
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,833
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...

534
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,515
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...

535
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,312
...climb Mount Niitaka."

536
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:49,300
Hostilities will begin
on December 7th...

537
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:54,796
...exactly as scheduled.

538
00:56:02,298 --> 00:56:03,886
Read this back to me.

539
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,990
"Japanese future action unpredictable.

540
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,660
But hostile action possible
at any moment.

541
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,315
If hostilities cannot be avoided...

542
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,420
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."

543
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,290
Wait a minute. Read that again.

544
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,840
"If hostilities cannot be avoided,
the United States desires...

545
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,850
...that Japan commit
the first overt act.

546
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,640
This shouldn't be construed
as restricting you...

547
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:45,650
...to a course of action
jeopardizing your defense.

548
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,820
Prior to hostile Japanese action...

549
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,940
...you are directed to undertake
reconnaissance...

550
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,240
...and other measures
as you deem necessary.

551
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,668
These measures should be
carried out...

552
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,160
...so as not to alarm
the civil population ...

553
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,830
...or disclose intent. By order
of General George C. Marshall."

554
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,340
"Not to alarm the civil population."

555
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,050
What do you make of it?

556
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,180
Well...

557
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,390
...if you ask me, sir,
it's double talk.

558
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,520
But the chief of staff doesn't go in
for double talk.

559
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,101
- We're going on alert.
- Again?

560
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,070
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.

561
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,240
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.

562
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,990
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

563
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,540
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo.

564
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:45,742
This dispatch is to be considered
a war warning."

565
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,590
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

566
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,220
You now have
as much information as I do.

567
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,890
That's the second warning
in three days.

568
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,850
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

569
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,100
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo."

570
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,430
They don't mention us.

571
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,560
That's correct. I think it should be
considered significant.

572
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,190
Well, gentlemen...

573
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,860
...we have a job to do.

574
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:19,700
Washington wants us to send
a squadron of fighters to Midway.

575
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,330
And another squadron to Wake.

576
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,250
When can you sail?

577
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:30,080
Well, the Enterprise can sail
tomorrow morning.

578
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:36,380
I'll need a day or two. We're just
completing repairs on the Lexington.

579
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,442
Hurry things along, John.

580
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,430
I want you out there to probe.

581
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,478
I want planes up in the air
morning and afternoon.

582
00:58:43,578 --> 00:58:47,230
I want a report on any sign
of hostile ships.

583
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,480
Understood.

584
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,440
Do you want battleships along?

585
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,440
Hell, no. They're too slow.

586
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,610
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.

587
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,990
We don't want anything holding us up.

588
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,740
You're right, but I'm not ready
to commit them myself.

589
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,780
Not until I know when and where.

590
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:06,330
Do you plan to keep half the fleet
at sea while the carriers are gone?

591
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
No, it's too risky.

592
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,250
I'll have to keep the fleet
here at Pearl while you're away.

593
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,300
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.

594
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,630
I don't like the idea of having my
battleships without air cover.

595
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,600
Yes, sir.

596
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,350
Admiral.

597
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:33,980
Kim.

598
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,860
Level with me.

599
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,990
I want a clear directive.

600
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,280
If I run into a Jap ship,
what action do I take?

601
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,910
Use your common sense.

602
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,000
That's the best damn order I ever had.

603
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,640
If I see so much as a sampan there...

604
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,430
...I'll blow it out of the water.

605
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,240
"Intelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...

606
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,700
...six battleships, three light cruisers...

607
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,697
...16 destroyers and one
aircraft carrier."

608
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,543
No information about
the other American carriers.

609
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,470
You know today's date?

610
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,390
December 1st.

611
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,640
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.

612
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,900
When we cross
the International Date Line...

613
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,610
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...

614
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:03,530
...and turn the calendar back a full day,
making today yesterday.

615
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,660
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!

616
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:17,370
You're not too intelligent
but I'll try to explain...

617
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:21,996
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?

618
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,430
So why are we making supper
at this hour?

619
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,720
1300? It should be lunchtime.

620
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:37,440
Right! And the Date Line makes up
for that time difference...

621
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,030
...by turning today into yesterday.

622
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,320
I don't quite understand, but if we
see the enemy across that line...

623
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,371
...I guess it would be useless
to shoot at them.

624
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:56,120
Because how can today's shells
hit yesterday's enemy?

625
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,360
What is it this time,
getting me over here?

626
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,405
Tokyo has alerted their embassy
to stand by...

627
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:26,070
...for a very long message
in 14 parts.

628
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,070
Look, Rufe, you scared me
and everybody else last week.

629
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,620
We're not doing that again, are we?

630
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:33,950
You should see this.

631
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,670
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.

632
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,840
Remember those troop ships?

633
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,470
They're still heading south
with an escort...

634
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,970
...only 14 hours
from the coast of Malaya.

635
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,930
What about their aircraft carriers?

636
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,640
We don't know.

637
01:02:57,350 --> 01:03:00,900
Intelligence was keeping track
of them until recently.

638
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,940
Now we've lost them.

639
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,400
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself
in their minds.

640
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:11,780
Where do you think I have been
the past week, night and day?

641
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,950
I am still convinced
they're going to attack us.

642
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,250
What can we do
that we aren't doing already?

643
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:25,380
I don't know about you,
but I know what I'm gonna do.

644
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,800
Where is everybody?

645
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,680
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.

646
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,906
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?

647
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,970
Yes, on the weekend.

648
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,814
"Only specially screened members
of your communications staff...

649
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:49,118
...are to be permitted to process
the 15-part message...

650
01:03:49,509 --> 01:03:53,606
...and prepare the typed translation."

651
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,580
It will be difficult without
the help of a skilled typist.

652
01:04:03,064 --> 01:04:05,960
The situation right now
is extremely delicate.

653
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,010
We must be prepared...

654
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:13,140
...to have each part of the message
decoded as soon as it comes in.

655
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,180
I'll alert the code room.

656
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,900
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.

657
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,670
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.

658
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,040
So this is the sound of Hawaii?

659
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:33,760
Disappointing news, our main targets,
the American carriers...

660
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:36,550
...have left Pearl Harbor.

661
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,020
This completes 13 parts?

662
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:49,860
Yes, Tokyo is holding
the final part till morning.

663
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,280
I wonder why.

664
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,610
It's almost 9.

665
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,700
Harry, I'm going to make the
rounds with what we have here.

666
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,080
Thank God the president's
back on the list.

667
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,620
Have Brotherhood call me
when the missing part is in.

668
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,250
Right.

669
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,650
You're late.

670
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,110
- Well, I was...
- Please, take me to the White House.

671
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,670
If you told me we were invited to the
White House, I would've dressed.

672
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,920
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

673
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,460
She's informal personally,
but a stickler for protocol...

674
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:58,590
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

675
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:38,840
Once more!

676
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,586
Steady.

677
01:08:04,862 --> 01:08:07,080
Great! We just sank the Nevada!

678
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,264
Pennsylvania!

679
01:08:17,864 --> 01:08:20,074
Oklahoma!

680
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,185
Enterprise!

681
01:08:24,285 --> 01:08:27,890
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!

682
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,306
Well?

683
01:08:44,606 --> 01:08:46,660
Captain Wilkinson's.

684
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,750
Did you see the president?

685
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,670
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.

686
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,090
And did he read the whatever it is?

687
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,640
No, he doesn't have the key.

688
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,217
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.

689
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:10,426
He took it in to the president.

690
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,810
And the president has a key,
I suppose?

691
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,940
Of course he has.

692
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,320
And did Lieutenant Schulz
say anything?

693
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,110
He said, "Thank you."

694
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,070
Darling, step on it, will you?

695
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:36,830
If we can see nothing, then neither
can American patrol planes.

696
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,090
I'm more concerned about
a submarine detecting us.

697
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,690
Dead on schedule.

698
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:08,620
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?

699
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,870
It's after 10, General Marshall
always retires early.

700
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:26,050
I see no reason to disturb Marshall
with something that's incomplete.

701
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:31,220
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.

702
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,924
If you're so concerned...

703
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:36,180
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?

704
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:39,020
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

705
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,360
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.

706
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,000
The president has already
discussed it with me.

707
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,210
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

708
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,710
But when the final part of this
comes in, I'd like to see it then.

709
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,300
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.

710
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,900
I was starved. I'll bet you are.

711
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,270
Oh, thank you, dear.

712
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,940
Can't you tell me anything?

713
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,610
Even a hint?

714
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,200
You'd think the world
was falling apart.

715
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:40,290
Admiral Stark talked to the president.

716
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,380
What did the president say?

717
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,630
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

718
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,290
Gordy. Ed.

719
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,630
We got those B-17s coming in
from California in the morning.

720
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,590
Honolulu radio will stay on
the air all night...

721
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,260
...so the planes can home in.

722
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,260
You and I had better be in that
control tower at 7:30 sharp.

723
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,390
- Yes, sir.
- Dear.

724
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,440
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.

725
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:51,530
Report to the new radar center
at Fort Shafter at 0400.

726
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,676
At 4:00 in the morning?

727
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,530
From 4 to 7 a.m.

728
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:58,910
Our marvel of science
only operates for three hours.

729
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,007
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!

730
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,689
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.

731
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,850
Just fine, Mr. Young.

732
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:26,230
In fact, I think
I'll turn in for a while.

733
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,950
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

734
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:46,420
The Commander-in-Chief
has sent a message...

735
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,483
...wishing us good luck.

736
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,420
That, plus the Imperial Proclamation...

737
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:58,250
...has undoubtedly stirred
your loyalty to the Empire.

738
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:01,930
The success of this mission...

739
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,407
...depends on surprise.
If we achieve it...

740
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,190
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora,"
will be sent out.

741
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,780
Now that the hour for battle
draws near...

742
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:20,573
...I will not burden you
with the usual pep talk.

743
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:26,119
Instead I shall hoist
the famous "Z" flag...

744
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:32,380
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to Victory...

745
01:14:32,862 --> 01:14:35,785
...in the historic battle
against the Russians.

746
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,480
Here you are.

747
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,440
Kramer.

748
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:32,190
AI, listen to this.

749
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,980
The fourteenth part.

750
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:36,860
"Will the ambassadors please
submit our reply...

751
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:40,820
...to the United States government
at precisely 1p.m...

752
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,990
...December 7th, your time."

753
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:44,950
1p.m.?

754
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,080
"Precisely 1p.m., your time."

755
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,050
I'll be right over.

756
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:14,360
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.

757
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,400
As you know, communications
have been delayed ...

758
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,320
...and frequently garbled lately.

759
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:22,240
Or deliberately interfered with.

760
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,910
Gene, call the foreign minister.

761
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,330
Tell him I want an immediate
audience with the emperor.

762
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,999
Why is this so important?

763
01:16:41,183 --> 01:16:43,890
Does this Roosevelt message
say anything new?

764
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:56,073
It merely proposes
a heart-to-heart exchange...

765
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,400
...between the two Chiefs of State.

766
01:17:00,652 --> 01:17:03,482
It could start negotiations afresh.

767
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,058
It's too late for that.

768
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,133
It's just as well the message
didn't come a day or two earlier.

769
01:17:24,977 --> 01:17:27,922
What do I tell Ambassador Grew?

770
01:17:28,567 --> 01:17:30,310
You are Foreign Minister!

771
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:34,270
Report to the palace alone
with the message.

772
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,440
"After deciphering...

773
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:44,990
...part 14...

774
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:48,620
...destroy at once...

775
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:55,120
...your cipher machine...

776
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,840
...all codes...

777
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:04,170
...and secret documents."

778
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,220
Translate this immediately.

779
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,010
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.

780
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,020
I've got to get the hell out of here.

781
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,748
Hey, look at this.

782
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,230
Finally got one.

783
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,492
Communication center.

784
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,770
It even works.

785
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,230
That's great.

786
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,070
Opana Point, communications check.

787
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,280
Are you reading us?

788
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,580
Coming in loud and clear.

789
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,620
Where's the General?

790
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,790
It's Sunday, sir.

791
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,060
This is Colonel Bratton.

792
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:22,270
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.

793
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,650
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.

794
01:20:30,278 --> 01:20:33,320
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.

795
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,780
Yes, Colonel Bratton.

796
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:39,500
I'm sorry, sir,
the General isn't here.

797
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:43,533
Where he always is
this time Sunday morning.

798
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,440
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.

799
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,690
He left this for you, sir.

800
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,220
Here is another part of the message, sir.

801
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:58,740
We are instructed to submit
the message at 1:00 p.m. today.

802
01:22:01,225 --> 01:22:02,910
One p.m.?

803
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,040
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...

804
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:12,210
...indicates to me
the Japanese are going to attack.

805
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,430
None of us doubt that war is coming.

806
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:20,220
We know they have
an expeditionary force heading south.

807
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:24,560
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...

808
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,100
...I recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel ...

809
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,060
...in Hawaii.

810
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:48,290
No.

811
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:52,880
I better call the president first.

812
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,380
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?

813
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:00,510
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

814
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:19,547
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.

815
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:25,346
Yes, they are eager because they
do not know the taste of battle.

816
01:27:09,577 --> 01:27:13,310
The mechanics asked me to give you
this for good luck at Pearl Harbor.

817
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,920
Bring her into the wind.

818
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:09,251
"The Japanese government regrets
to have to notify...

819
01:32:09,351 --> 01:32:11,230
...the American government...

820
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,520
...that, in view of the attitude
of the American government...

821
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:17,780
...it cannot but consider
that it is impossible to reach...

822
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,280
...an agreement
through further negotiations."

823
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:21,530
- Sir.
- Hm?

824
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:24,870
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.

825
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:39,340
Gentlemen, I am convinced
the Japanese intend to attack...

826
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,010
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.

827
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,821
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.

828
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,900
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.

829
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:00,780
Take this to communications center.

830
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,677
We will follow that ship
into Pearl Harbor.

831
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:35,270
Come in.

832
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,110
Captain, can you come to the bridge?

833
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,900
Very well.

834
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:46,120
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?

835
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,780
- We're not sure.
- What ship?

836
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:50,120
The Navy tug Antares.

837
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:52,960
Look astern of her, captain.

838
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:56,000
She's towing a target raft.

839
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:58,710
Look between the ship
and the raft, sir.

840
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:10,760
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.

841
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:14,310
She's sneaking through the net
into the harbor. General Quarters.

842
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,425
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.

843
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:39,840
Come left 15 degrees, sir.

844
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:43,050
- Tell Antares we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.

845
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,640
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.

846
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,360
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.

847
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:24,335
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.

848
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,800
Roll one.

849
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:41,230
Roll two.

850
01:35:55,580 --> 01:36:00,040
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges
on a sub in our security zone.

851
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,750
Aye, aye, sir.

852
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,742
Captain Earle speaking.

853
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:26,860
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.

854
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:32,950
"Have dropped depth charges on sub
operating in our security zone."

855
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,490
We've had so many of these
false sightings, Kaminsky.

856
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,500
But this is the real thing, sir.

857
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,670
Closer than any previous sighting.

858
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,380
Just off the harbor entrance.

859
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,670
You and I know the skipper
of that destroyer is a green kid.

860
01:36:47,826 --> 01:36:49,345
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.

861
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:53,510
With all due respect, sir, I think
we should alert all commanders.

862
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:59,310
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.

863
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:26,130
The sunburst reminds me
of our flag, a good omen.

864
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:52,360
Ed, this is hot.

865
01:37:52,570 --> 01:37:56,240
General Marshall wants it sent to
all commanders by the fastest route.

866
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,950
Right.

867
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:04,960
The General's handwriting,
it's hard to read.

868
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:09,170
You're gonna have to help me
with it, Rufe.

869
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,641
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu
on the radio.

870
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,921
Check your direction-finder dial.

871
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:14,719
It's coming from five degrees
to port, sir.

872
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:18,838
Okay, keep riding that beam.

873
01:39:42,127 --> 01:39:45,786
Major, I picked up
some great music from Honolulu.

874
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,560
That's fine, pipe it through.

875
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:53,127
Okay.

876
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,500
Where's the damn chow truck?

877
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:16,170
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.

878
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,300
Hey, Joe, come here.

879
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:20,510
What do you make of that?

880
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,680
I've been watching it for minutes.

881
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,680
It's moving in, fast.

882
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:27,020
I've never seen anything that big.

883
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:30,340
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, I got it.

884
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:35,747
I make that about 140 miles north,
three degrees east.

885
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,490
Don't make sense,
we got no planes out that far.

886
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:41,915
We gotta contact
the information center.

887
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,200
Our problem is over at 7:00.

888
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:47,040
The center might make
some sense out of it.

889
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,700
Okay, suit yourself.

890
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,380
Information center.

891
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:06,260
Yeah? I don't know, Mac,
we're all closed down here.

892
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:09,270
Is that right? Hang on a minute.

893
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,230
Lieutenant, sir.

894
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,900
Lieutenant Tyler.

895
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:22,650
Sir, this is Private Elliot,
Opana Point.

896
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,041
There's a large formation
of planes coming in...

897
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:28,290
...140 miles, three degrees east.

898
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,080
Yeah?

899
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,540
Well, don't worry about it.

900
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,090
The boys at Opana Point must have
picked up the B-17s...

901
01:41:40,253 --> 01:41:41,920
...coming in from the mainland.

902
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,390
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.

903
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:59,440
Colonel, I sent this to Manila,
the canal zone and San Francisco...

904
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:02,280
...but the direct channel
to Hawaii is out.

905
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:04,110
Atmospherics again?

906
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,070
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.

907
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,490
We could give it to the Navy.

908
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:12,750
What makes you think
their atmospherics are better?

909
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,130
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.

910
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:30,698
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.

911
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:35,507
I hope everything is on schedule.

912
01:42:35,807 --> 01:42:37,532
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...

913
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:40,708
...that we follow the rules
of the Geneva Convention.

914
01:42:40,984 --> 01:42:43,424
Our declaration of war
will be delivered...

915
01:42:43,654 --> 01:42:46,968
...at 1:00 p.m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.

916
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:15,021
The typing still isn't finished.

917
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:19,980
We'll have to postpone our 1:00
appointment with Secretary Hull.

918
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:26,990
Do you mean a submarine was
sighted over half an hour ago...

919
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,370
...and that it's taken
this long to report it to me?

920
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:34,700
I don't care if it
still hasn't been confirmed.

921
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:38,670
I should've been informed after
the ward radioed a first report.

922
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:42,710
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.

923
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,710
Get the confirmation,
all the reports to my office.

924
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:49,300
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.

925
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,050
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...

926
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:54,220
...should I tell General Short
you'll miss the golf date?

927
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:57,390
No, damn it, get my car.

928
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:05,650
A message for the General
at Fort Shafter.

929
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:08,400
- Is it marked urgent?
- No.

930
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,870
It's a little bumpy, Davey...

931
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:05,420
...but you have to fly
in all kinds of weather.

932
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:07,946
Sure, Miss Fort.

933
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,940
Don't let the nose drop.

934
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:31,280
That's better.
You're doing just fine.

935
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:53,340
I'm taking over, Davey.

936
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:19,030
Warrant Officer Mizuki,
signal all planes, "prepare to attack."

937
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:28,500
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack."

938
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:16,300
Everything is strangely quiet.

939
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:22,100
The American anti-aircraft
batteries haven't fired a shot!

940
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,706
And no enemy fighters
over the harbor, sir!

941
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:36,780
We've done it!

942
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:44,849
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

943
01:47:48,945 --> 01:47:51,170
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

944
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:53,810
Stand by.

945
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:01,799
Execute.

946
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,650
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.

947
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:38,520
Come on!

948
01:51:44,150 --> 01:51:47,752
Alert all commands:

949
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:50,990
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.

950
01:51:51,502 --> 01:51:54,290
This is no drill."

951
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:27,380
General Quarters. General Quarters.

952
01:52:27,587 --> 01:52:31,200
Man your stations. Man your stations.

953
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:38,910
Sir.

954
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:58,770
Battle stations. Battle stations.

955
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,780
Fire your gun. Fire at will.

956
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:13,130
That bastard!

957
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:33,090
Station six, man your pump.

958
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:45,946
Plane to starboard.

959
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,520
You bastard!

960
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:02,240
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.

961
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,000
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.

962
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,790
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

963
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,300
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

964
01:54:52,961 --> 01:54:55,220
What in the hell is going on?

965
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:58,260
Why wasn't the Army notified?

966
01:54:58,510 --> 01:55:02,626
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.

967
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:05,390
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.

968
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,190
Alert the territorial guard.

969
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:09,254
Open a command post
at Aliamanu Crater.

970
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,230
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.

971
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:19,280
Oh, my God.

972
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,405
The island's under attack.

973
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:24,080
Those bastards will kill us all.

974
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:28,080
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.

975
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,781
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

976
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,260
- Operator.
- Duarte Air Field.

977
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:41,550
All the phone lines are jammed.

978
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,843
Well, try the radio again.

979
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:15,738
Hose down that plane.

980
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:30,996
Run for it.

981
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:32,860
Run, run!

982
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:41,660
There's Hickam.

983
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:44,990
Major, I heard something
funny on the Honolulu radio.

984
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:51,620
What kind of traffic control is this?

985
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:54,090
The radio said
something about an attack.

986
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:55,840
They're Japs, sir.

987
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:03,720
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.

988
01:57:03,970 --> 01:57:05,810
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.

989
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:09,020
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.

990
01:57:09,230 --> 01:57:12,690
Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam,
try Bellows or Wheeler.

991
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:26,330
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.

992
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,990
They shot one circuit box.

993
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,200
The landing light isn't working.

994
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:32,540
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.

995
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,070
- Major.
- Yeah.

996
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,440
One wheel is stuck.

997
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:02,400
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.

998
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,740
- I tried.
- Try again!

999
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,780
Here they come. Fire!

1000
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:20,090
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.

1001
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:29,904
Major, no go, sir.

1002
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:34,645
Like I said, it's a hell of a way
to fly into a war.

1003
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,260
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!

1004
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,050
Tower to B-17,
there's a Jap on your tail.

1005
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:11,236
Goose your engine and get out.

1006
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:52,570
Have damage control report
all damages.

1007
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:55,240
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.

1008
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:57,750
Okay, sergeant,
let's get the men down.

1009
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:00,042
All right, you guys, let's go.

1010
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,750
Where the hell are our fighters?

1011
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:29,780
Captain, the main fuel tanks
are fractured.

1012
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:32,360
Lower deck's flooded,
we're listing eight degrees.

1013
02:01:32,570 --> 02:01:34,815
Counter flood, counter flood.

1014
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,800
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.

1015
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,800
There's your confirmation!

1016
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:59,470
"Oklahoma, capsized.

1017
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:03,770
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward
and is down to a head.

1018
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:08,110
West Virginia, subjected to six
torpedo hits and several deck fires.

1019
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,820
Raleigh and Helena
damaged and listing."

1020
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:15,990
The California, two torpedoes, fires
all around, temporarily abandoned.

1021
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,200
I've just come from her.

1022
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:32,190
It's spent, sir.

1023
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:42,240
Would've been merciful had it killed me.

1024
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:55,130
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.

1025
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:59,773
"Have inflicted serious damage
on numerous battleships."

1026
02:04:17,655 --> 02:04:19,726
Better than we had dreamed!

1027
02:04:26,791 --> 02:04:28,839
Where are our priority targets...

1028
02:04:30,381 --> 02:04:32,290
...the American carriers?

1029
02:04:36,525 --> 02:04:38,420
Mr. Secretary.

1030
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:44,810
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."

1031
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:48,400
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.

1032
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:51,810
No, sir. It's Pearl.

1033
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:56,320
Get me the White House,
the direct line.

1034
02:04:56,570 --> 02:04:57,990
Yes, sir.

1035
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:07,660
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you
in a moment. Please be seated.

1036
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:15,302
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?

1037
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:19,380
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed ...

1038
02:05:19,630 --> 02:05:22,782
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.

1039
02:05:23,725 --> 02:05:25,470
They're waiting outside.

1040
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:31,315
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.

1041
02:06:31,450 --> 02:06:35,066
George, get a hold of a car,
a truck, anything.

1042
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:38,590
I'm calling Haleiwa to get them
to start our planes. Go.

1043
02:06:38,748 --> 02:06:39,920
Right!

1044
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:41,730
Battleship on the left, sir!

1045
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,390
It's the Nevada. She's making
a run for the sea!

1046
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:57,655
If we sink her in the channel,
the harbor will be blocked for months!

1047
02:09:08,070 --> 02:09:10,610
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.

1048
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:14,454
- Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
- Stay at 2-3-0, sir.

1049
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:02,206
Take cover!

1050
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:20,755
More hose! More hose!

1051
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:38,990
- More water. More! More water.

1052
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:42,540
- Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

1053
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:59,050
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!

1054
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:06,020
Can't get through
the outer channel in this shape.

1055
02:11:06,190 --> 02:11:09,082
She goes down here,
she'll block the south channel.

1056
02:11:09,289 --> 02:11:11,844
We'll have to beach her there
so she's clear.

1057
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:59,696
File these.

1058
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:14,270
G-5.

1059
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:22,610
- I need five copies each.

1060
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:26,700
Messenger.

1061
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:31,450
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.

1062
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:34,561
File these.

1063
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:49,300
Corporal.

1064
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:51,800
This has to be decoded
for the General.

1065
02:15:51,970 --> 02:15:54,970
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.

1066
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:56,520
Yes, sir.

1067
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,490
Run!

1068
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,540
Run for it!

1069
02:16:25,765 --> 02:16:28,550
Drop the hose
and get the ladders and axes.

1070
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:30,890
What are you waiting for?

1071
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,198
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?

1072
02:16:33,350 --> 02:16:36,028
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.

1073
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:39,140
The tanker in the ocean there
is full of aviation fuel.

1074
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:41,506
If it goes, we'll blow up
half the harbor.

1075
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:43,347
Come on, hurry up!

1076
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:03,967
Get out of the way!

1077
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:47,967
Hey, look out!

1078
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:12,280
In all my 50 years
of public service...

1079
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:18,120
...I have never seen a document
so crowded with infamous falsehoods...

1080
02:18:18,229 --> 02:18:20,120
...and distortions...

1081
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:22,924
...on a scale so huge...

1082
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:26,031
...that I never imagined until today...

1083
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:29,644
...that any government
on this planet...

1084
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:32,337
...was capable of uttering them.

1085
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:47,916
Mr. Hull.

1086
02:18:49,988 --> 02:18:51,440
Go.

1087
02:19:56,550 --> 02:20:02,041
What's the matter? Why in hell
doesn't the next wave take off?

1088
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:05,724
But, sir, no one has given the order.

1089
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:24,364
We've knocked out
the American airfields...

1090
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:28,000
...sunk four battleships,
heavily damaged three more.

1091
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:37,919
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's
carrier has signaled!

1092
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:41,624
"Attack group ready for takeoff."

1093
02:20:51,565 --> 02:20:55,846
Unfortunately, the American
carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.

1094
02:20:57,894 --> 02:20:59,942
Since we don't know where they are...

1095
02:21:00,679 --> 02:21:03,820
...we can't use our limited
supply of fuel to look for them.

1096
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:10,574
We must not forget that enemy
submarines will be searching for us.

1097
02:21:12,484 --> 02:21:14,486
We have been lucky so far.

1098
02:21:17,248 --> 02:21:18,928
No take-off signal yet?

1099
02:21:19,050 --> 02:21:20,953
There is a signal now!

1100
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:30,434
It says, "All ships head for Japan
as soon as our planes return."

1101
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:40,860
It can't be!

1102
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:45,700
It must be a mistake!

1103
02:21:51,491 --> 02:21:53,908
We cannot turn back now.

1104
02:21:55,242 --> 02:21:59,684
We must destroy the American
carriers and their dry docks...

1105
02:21:59,822 --> 02:22:01,019
...no matter how long it takes!

1106
02:22:01,157 --> 02:22:06,010
You're wrong. Our mission has
been completely accomplished.

1107
02:22:07,969 --> 02:22:13,515
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.

1108
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:24,492
This war is just beginning.

1109
02:22:27,415 --> 02:22:29,325
We have a long way to go.

1110
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:54,179
Yes, all right.

1111
02:22:54,409 --> 02:22:58,730
This came from the decoding room,
a cablegram from the War Department.

1112
02:23:11,715 --> 02:23:13,970
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.

1113
02:23:31,736 --> 02:23:32,933
Pardon me, admiral.

1114
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:35,770
- From Washington.
- Thank you.

1115
02:23:43,151 --> 02:23:44,940
Gentlemen.

1116
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:54,496
"The Japanese are presenting
at 1p.m...

1117
02:23:54,818 --> 02:23:57,420
...Eastern Standard Time today...

1118
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:00,111
...what amounts to an ultimatum.

1119
02:24:02,666 --> 02:24:07,800
Just what significance the hour set
may have, we do not know...

1120
02:24:10,007 --> 02:24:12,810
...but be on alert accordingly."

1121
02:24:14,195 --> 02:24:15,810
Signed ...

1122
02:24:16,404 --> 02:24:20,770
...George C. Marshall,
chief of staff.

1123
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:31,780
My God.

1124
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:51,108
This leaves the Navy with only two
combat groups in the Central Pacific.

1125
02:24:51,292 --> 02:24:53,760
Ours and the Lexington.

1126
02:24:54,054 --> 02:24:56,286
We don't want to get caught
like they did.

1127
02:24:56,390 --> 02:24:59,770
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?

1128
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:03,075
We can fuel and provision
and be under way before dawn.

1129
02:25:03,282 --> 02:25:06,400
Good. That's good.

1130
02:25:16,837 --> 02:25:21,002
Here is an announcement from the
Navy Department released December 7th.

1131
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:26,502
"Before daybreak today,
the Imperial Navy successfully launched...

1132
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:31,312
...a large-scale air raid against
the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."

1133
02:25:31,957 --> 02:25:34,600
We salute the Commander-in-Chief
of our Fleet...

1134
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:37,203
...Admiral Yamamoto.

1135
02:25:54,486 --> 02:25:58,467
I had intended to deal a fatal blow
to the American fleet...

1136
02:25:58,766 --> 02:26:01,080
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...

1137
02:26:01,828 --> 02:26:05,250
...immediately after Japan's
official declaration of war.

1138
02:26:10,273 --> 02:26:14,840
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...

1139
02:26:15,865 --> 02:26:18,760
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...

1140
02:26:18,995 --> 02:26:22,562
...was delivered in Washington.

1141
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:28,362
I can't imagine anything...

1142
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:32,504
...that would infuriate
the Americans more.

1143
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:39,450
I fear all we have done...

1144
02:26:40,719 --> 02:26:45,414
...is to awaken a sleeping giant
and fill him with a terrible resolve.
