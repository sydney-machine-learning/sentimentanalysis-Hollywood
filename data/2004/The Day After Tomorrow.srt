1
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,050
You see how it's done?

2
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,770
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

3
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,880
You better.

4
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,580
The boss will chew my head off
if these cores get messed up.

5
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,450
Don't worry.

6
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,470
We're at 26 feet.

7
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,430
You let Jason operate the drill?

8
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,670
Yeah, he can handle it.

9
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,550
I didn't do anything.

10
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,110
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!

11
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,510
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!

12
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,030
You're not gonna make it!

13
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,190
Jack!

14
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,710
Jack! Give me your hand!

15
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,950
I've got you!

16
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,110
What were you thinking?

17
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,470
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!

18
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,790
That's what's happening!

19
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,520
What we have found

20
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,410
locked to these ice cores is evidence
of a cataclysmic climate shift

21
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,600
that occurred around
10,000 years ago.

22
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,030
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores

23
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,550
indicates that runaway warming
pushed the planet into an ice age

24
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,990
which lasted two centuries.

25
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,190
I'm confused.

26
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,500
I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.

27
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,950
Yes, it is a paradox, but global
warming can trigger a cooling trend.

28
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,150
Let me explain.

29
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,800
The northern hemisphere
owes its temperate climate

30
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,550
to the North Atlantic current.

31
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,510
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

32
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,310
But, global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

33
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,030
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...

34
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,110
there goes our warm climate.

35
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,030
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

36
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,970
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years,
maybe in 1000.

37
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,880
But what I do know is that
if we do not act soon,

38
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,590
it is our children and our grandchildren
who will have to pay the price.

39
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,390
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

40
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,430
It will cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

41
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,050
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President,

42
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,040
the cost of doing nothing
could be even higher.

43
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,550
Our climate is fragile.

44
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,950
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment,

45
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,350
the ice caps will soon disappear.

46
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,870
Professor, um, Hall...

47
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,070
our economy is every bit
as fragile as the environment.

48
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,560
Perhaps you should
keep that in mind

49
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,870
before making
sensationalist claims.

50
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,220
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off

51
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,350
was about the size of
the state of Rhode Island.

52
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,310
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

53
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,910
<i>Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!</i>

54
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,270
I'm here at the global warming
conference in New Delhi,

55
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,360
where,
if you can believe your eyes,

56
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,270
it's snowing.

57
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,710
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos,

58
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,630
with hundreds of homeless people
freezing to death.

59
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,830
Taxi!

60
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,150
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.

61
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,830
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

62
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,260
Quite. I was wondering
if I could talk to you

63
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,850
about your theory on
abrupt climate shift.

64
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,310
The name's Rapson.
Terry Rapson.

65
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,960
Professor Rapson?

66
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,780
- Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.

67
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,470
I've read your work on
ocean currents.

68
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,310
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.

69
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,950
Over here.

70
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,800
<i>Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where Manchester United</i>

71
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,460
<i>leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic.</i>

72
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,740

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,770
<i>We return to the action
63 minutes into the second half</i>

74
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,760

75
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,700
<i>Let's get back to our
commentator</i>

76
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,630
<i>Donald MacFarland.</i>

77
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,070
What? Yeah.

78
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,190
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.

79
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,750
The baby kept us awake all night.

80
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,900
<i>And still.</i>

81
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
Good!

82
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,610
Dennis?

83
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,850
NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing
a temperature drop of 13 degrees.

84
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,190
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's...

85
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,230
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.

86
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,110
Must have knocked it about.

87
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,790
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!

88
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,430
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!

89
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,430
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?

90
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,390
Hello, professor.
How was India?

91
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,150
Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.

92
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,270
All dancing girls,
wine and parties.

93
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,510
<i>The fury of Hurricane Noelani
stunned weather experts yesterday</i>

94
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,840
<i>slamming into
the unprepared island chain</i>

95
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,810
<i>with a cataclysmic force

96
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,160
<i>Meteorologists already believe

97
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
<i>ever recorded.</i>

98
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,830
Are you gonna get that?

99
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,180
Hello?

100
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,620
I just saw that Sam
got an F in calculus.

101
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,230
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

102
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,510
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.

103
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,750
All right, I don't have time
to talk about this right now.

104
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,550
Well, maybe you ought to
make time.

105
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,470
Excuse me, I'm not the one

106
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,420
who's away for months
and months at a time.

107
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,830
I just don't understand.

108
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,620
I'll let him explain it to you.

109
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,270
Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

110
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,080
Sam's getting on a plane?

111
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,800
He joined the Scholastic
Decathlon Team.

112
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,470
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?

113
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,310
- Yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.

114
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,230
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?

115
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,620
I gotta go because
I'm on call tonight.

116
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,730
Jack, please don't be late.
I don't want him taking a taxi again.

117
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,910
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.

118
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,380
<i>This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level four,</i>

119
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,530
<i>conference room B.</i>

120
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,510
Jack?

121
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,520
I know you have an innate talent

122
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,510
for rubbing people
the wrong way Jack, but why?

123
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,570
Why, for the love of god,

124
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,090
would you aggravate
the vice president?

125
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,540
Because my 17-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

126
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,070
Perhaps. But your 17-year-old kid
does not control our budget.

127
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,830
- It doesn't matter if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.

128
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,040
You're missing the point.

129
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,180
What I'm trying to tell you is,

130
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,560
- if Raymond Becker pulls our budget...
- Oh, shit!

131
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,840
- Wait... Will you...?
Jack.

132
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,350
Oh, my god.

133
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,310
- Hi Sam. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, it's fine. The cab's already here.

134
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,190
That's okay. I'll take care of it.

135
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,630
- What are you gonna...?
- Here you go.

136
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,390
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

137
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,790
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- Sam, how can there be two sides?

138
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,040
Hey look. I got every question
right on the final.

139
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,860
And the only reason
why Mr. Spengler failed me

140
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,540
was because I didn't write
out the solutions.

141
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Why not?

142
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,110
I do them in my head.

143
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,220
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.

144
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,180
He said that if he can't do them
in his head, then I must be cheating.

145
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,640
Oh, that's ridiculous.

146
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,940
How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

147
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,310
That's what I said.

148
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,230
You did?

149
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,470
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?

150
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,590
Oh, yeah.

151
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,870
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.

152
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,030
I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

153
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,760
We're gonna get this
whole thing straighten out.

154
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,390
Hey, you can't park there.

155
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,830
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?

156
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,310
Sam.

157
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,510
<i>Parker, this is Houston.</i>

158
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,390
<i>We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.</i>

159
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,230
<i>It doesn't look like
you're coming back this week.</i>

160
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,430
<i>Your wife's gonna give
me an earful.</i>

161
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,230
Roger that.

162
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,720
Hey, come take a look at
this storm system.

163
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
It's enormous.

164
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,750
You all right?

165
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,310
He's afraid of flying.

166
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,230
I'm fine.

167
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,770
You know statistically,

168
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,170
the chance of a plane going down
because of turbulence is less than,

169
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,100
what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

170
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,150
- I can't remember if it's a...
- Shut up, Brian.

171
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,750
Listen, Sam...

172
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,830
don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

173
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,790
They're still serving drinks.

174
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,440
<i>Hey folks, it appears we're gonna
have a little bit of a bumpy ride here</i>

175
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
<i>for the next few minutes.</i>

176
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,630
<i>Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables</i>

177
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,470
<i>and seatbacks in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.</i>

178
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,550
Grab it. Watch out!

179
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,510
Sam?

180
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,230
Sam.

181
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,870
Can I have my hand back?

182
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,670
I can't believe I'm spending
two weeks alone with my mom.

183
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,070
Be patient with her.

184
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,860
She's been looking forward to
this holiday for months.

185
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,630
I know.

186
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,950
I love you.

187
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,070
I love you too.

188
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,150
Hey.

189
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,270
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

190
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,400
<i>The cause of this extreme
weather remains a mystery,</i>

191
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,850
<i>although some meteorologists
believe sunspots are to blame.</i>

192
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,920
<i>Hundreds are missing...</i>

193
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,210
This is very odd.

194
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,150
There's a buoy here registering
a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.

195
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,430
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

196
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,540
I'll put a call in,

197
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,610
see if there are any ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

198
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,790
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.

199
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,950
What?

200
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,180
What are the odds of
two buoys failing?

201
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Remote.

202
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,590
Make that three.

203
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,760
Just another typical day
in New York City.

204
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,340
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.

205
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,650
Lookie here, Buddha.

206
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,020
These people, and their cars,
and their exhaust

207
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,950
and they're just polluting
the atmosphere.

208
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,750
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

209
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,150
We're almost there.

210
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,470
- We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.

211
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,750
What's gotten into them?

212
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,430
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

213
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,790
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro

214
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,650
defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

215
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,850
What is his name?
Time.

216
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,190
Montezuma.

217
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,110
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

218
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,230
It's, like, Anta-something.

219
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,070
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!

220
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,230
Time's up. Correct answers, please.

221
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:23,830
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

222
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,390
Next question.

223
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:34,190
In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

224
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,550
This place is so retro,

225
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,100
it might actually be cool
if it were on purpose.

226
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,150
Yeah, look at all these nerds.

227
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,310
Hey.

228
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,870
Hey.

229
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,070
You look beautiful.

230
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,950
Thanks. This place is incredible.

231
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,110
Do you believe that
this is their cafeteria?

232
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,070
You played a great first round.

233
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,230
So did you.

234
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,150
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

235
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,390
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.

236
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,470
- Your school's amazing.
- Would you like... would you like a tour?

237
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,590
Sure. That'd be great.

238
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,750
Could you hold this for a sec?

239
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,630
Yeah, sure.

240
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,310
Thanks.

241
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,790
Man, you got some
serious competition.

242
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,750
Please.

243
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,110
- I bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.

244
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,430
Who is it?

245
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,200
<i>Terry Rapson here.</i>

246
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,390
<i>Sorry to call you so early.</i>

247
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,670
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

248
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,060
Well, we've found something
extraordinary.

249
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,540
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

250
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,670
You recall what you said
in New Delhi

251
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,290
about how polar melting might
disrupt the North Atlantic Current?

252
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,390
Yes.

253
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,030
Well...

254
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,670
I think it's happening.

255
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,390
What do you mean?

256
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,590
<i>One of our NOMAD buoys
registered a 13-degree drop</i>

257
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,160
<i>in surface temperature
the other day.</i>

258
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,710
<i>I've sent you an e-mail.</i>

259
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,470
Hold on.

260
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,470
<i>At first we thought
it was a malfunction.</i>

261
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,140
<i>But there are four more
across the North Atlantic</i>

262
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,390
<i> showing the same thing.</i>

263
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,070
This is unbelievable.

264
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,510
You predicted it would happen.

265
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,350
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

266
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,410
<i>There are no</i>

267
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,870
forecast models remotely capable
of plotting this scenario,

268
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,510
<i>except yours.</i>

269
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,030
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

270
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,070
It's not a forecast model.

271
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,510
<i>It's the closest thing we have.</i>

272
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,350
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

273
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,710
At least not in the last
10,000 years.

274
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,590
<i>As I predicted yesterday,</i>

275
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,590
the swell off Hurricane
Noelani is incredible.

276
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,110
<i>These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.</i>

277
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,540
Shouldn't you be monitoring
the weather or something?

278
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,290
This is L.A. What weather?

279
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,070
Wait. What's that noise?

280
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,110
What noise?

281
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,390
Honey, I'll be right back.

282
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,100
<i>The Coast Guard has
closed the beaches,</i>

283
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,090
<i>as waves have grown too big for...</i>

284
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,220
L.A. Weather Center.

285
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,610
<i>It's Tommy.
I'm down at the beach.</i>

286
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,270
I'm in the middle of something,
Tommy. What do you need?

287
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,180
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

288
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,980
<i>A low-pressure system moving
along the California coastline</i>

289
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,590
<i>is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.</i>

290
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,090
<i>Yeah? Hello?</i>

291
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,780
Hey boss, turn on The Weather
Channel right away.

292
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,490
<i>I think we have to issue
a tornado warning.</i>

293
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,990
What are you talking about?

294
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,390
<i>Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess of 70 miles...</i>

295
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,510
Hold on a second.

296
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,030
<i>...conditions that are highly
unusual for California.</i>

297
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,510
Tom, we're building a forecast model,
we're gonna need... what?

298
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,910
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

299
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,950
- Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.

300
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,150
You know I would say that
you've lost your mind

301
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,460
but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

302
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,960
Tom, this is important.

303
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,530
What's this forecast model
you're building,

304
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,780
if you don't mind my asking?

305
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,920
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.

306
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,540
Janet's a hurricane specialist
with NASA.

307
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,340
Jack's a paleoclimatologist,

308
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,390
and I have absolutely no idea
what he's up to.

309
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,510
Booker. What's going on here?

310
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,550
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

311
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,750
<i>Breaking news as we prepare
to go live to Los Angeles.</i>

312
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,390
<i>- Mixed reports are coming in about...
- Report is just coming out.</i>

313
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,540
<i>some extreme weather
occurring in the area.</i>

314
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,670
<i>Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.</i>

315
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,510
<i>We have live coverage now
from our Fox 11 chopper.</i>

316
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,770
<i>Are you there, Bart?</i>

317
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,060
Uh, yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast...

318
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,350
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my god.

319
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,050
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

320
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,790
This tornado just came and
erased the Hollywood sign.

321
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,070
<i>The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.</i>

322
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,320
<i>Bart, what can you see?
Is anyone hurt?</i>

323
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,120
<i>I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage down there.</i>

324
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,990
And there are people down there,
taking pictures.

325
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,940
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

326
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,250
Go for cover!

327
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,830
You can't stay here!
Get out of here!

328
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,200
What you're seeing are
two actual tornados

329
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,500
striking Los Angeles
International Airport.

330
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,520
Wait. Wait.

331
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,930
It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

332
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,630
- Tommy!
- Oh, my god!

333
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,830
Holy shit!

334
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,370
<i>I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away from the areas...</i>

335
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,980
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on Yucca and Vine.

336
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,110
- I'm on my way there now.
- You're on TV. Right in the middle of it.

337
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,510
God! Oh, my god!

338
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,950
You gotta get out of there, man.

339
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,950
<i>That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!</i>

340
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,390
<i>Oh, my god.
I hope no one was in that car.</i>

341
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,170
<i>For our national audience
just joining us now</i>

342
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,090
<i>we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now.</i>

343
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,930
Tommy?

344
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,870
<i>If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.</i>

345
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,510
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

346
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,790
It's one of many tornados
that are destroying our city.

347
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,230
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

348
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,070
<i>It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.</i>

349
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,910
What's happening?

350
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,790
It- it- it looks like some sort of

351
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,190
huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing...

352
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,350
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

353
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,770
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening Raymond?

354
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,270
I'll call you back.

355
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,430
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

356
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,110
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

357
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,280
What do you think we should do?

358
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Until we can figure it out
what's going on here I...

359
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,510
I don't think we have
much choice, sir.

360
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,590
<i>What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.</i>

361
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,310
Hey, man, I just got off
the phone with my mom.

362
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,430
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

363
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,810
<i>The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.</i>

364
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,300
<i>Unfortunately, the order came
too late for two planes</i>

365
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,510
<i>that were brought down by
severe turbulence in the Midwest.</i>

366
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,670
- The first flight...
- So much for "one in a billion."

367
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,440
All right.
All right, listen up, everybody.

368
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,660
Listen up, please.

369
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,790
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time

370
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,370
so let's get started, please.
Vorsteen?

371
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,750
All our grid models are worthless.

372
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,870
I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

373
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,400
The Canadians are reporting
tremendous circulation

374
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,610
moving down from the Arctic.

375
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,830
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure
system unlike anything we've seen,

376
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,190
and Australia just saw the strongest
typhoon ever recorded.

377
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,650
Hang on. Are you saying that
these things are interconnected?

378
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,010
We have to consider the possibility.

379
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,910
The only force strong enough to
affect global weather is the sun.

380
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,940
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.

381
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,670
Solar output is normal.

382
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,700
What about the
North Atlantic Current?

383
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
What about it?

384
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,670
I got a call last night...

385
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,150
from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

386
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,790
He thinks the current has changed.

387
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,150
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

388
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,670
The current depends upon a delicate
balance of salt and freshwater.

389
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,430
- We all know that.
- Yes.

390
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,310
But no one has taken into account

391
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,840
how much freshwater has been
dumped into the ocean

392
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,590
because of melting polar ice.

393
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,430
I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

394
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,990
It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

395
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,950
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

396
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,760
They've asked me to feed it into
my paleoclimate model

397
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,420
to track the next set of events.

398
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,250
Hold on Jack.

399
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,420
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

400
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,910
Not just continue. Get worse.

401
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,010
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

402
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,590
Tom. What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

403
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,780
What do you expect me
to tell them?

404
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,480
The government has to start making
long term preparations, now.

405
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,840
Jack, all you have is a theory.

406
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,740
Well, then give me the mainframe.
And let me prove it.

407
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
No.

408
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,430
You have 48 hours.

409
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,990
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.

410
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,070
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.

411
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,710
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

412
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,590
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

413
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,200
Can the model you're working on
factoring in storm scenarios?

414
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,790
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.

415
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,630
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

416
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,790
Hi, I'm Jason.

417
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,990
Hi.

418
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,170
Do you have the results of
Peter's CT scan?

419
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,870
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.

420
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,830
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.

421
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,670
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.

422
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,830
Good.

423
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,190
Let me listen here.

424
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,790
Can you read that?

425
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,310
No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.

426
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,990
You do?

427
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,310
My mother used to read it to me.

428
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,790
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

429
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,510
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

430
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,070
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

431
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,990
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

432
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,870
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

433
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,830
Maybe I'll try to shut
my eyes for a while.

434
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,150
Call me when you get the results.

435
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,780
Frank, is he always so obsessive?

436
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,710
- Yeah.
- Yes.

437
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,190
Does he ever lighten up?

438
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,030
- Not really.
- No.

439
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,090
How long have you been
working together?

440
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,070
Well, Frank's been working with
him since the Stone Age,

441
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,550
but I've only had to endure
two years of servitude.

442
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,270
Jack.

443
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,990
Jack, we got the results.

444
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,750
Six to eight months?
That can't be.

445
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,550
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.

446
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,750
<i>Widespread flooding has
slowed transportation</i>

447
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,070
<i>and caused numerous closures,</i>

448
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,030
<i>including the Lincoln and
Holland Tunnels.</i>

449
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,130
The plumbing in the school
is really old.

450
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,980
And I guess seeing with all this rain,
the sewage got stopped up.

451
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,580
Where are you staying tonight?

452
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,310
<i>They're finding a place for us to stay
with kids here in New York City.</i>

453
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,110
Are you sure you can't get home
any sooner than tomorrow?

454
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,110
Well, look, dad, I would if I could,
you know. I just...

455
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,150
This smell is unbearable, dad.

456
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,500
Stop kidding around!
I want you home.

457
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,150
<i>Dad, I'll be on the train.</i>

458
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,570
Do me a favor okay.
Just don't worry about me.

459
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,820
I'll figure it out.

460
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,670
All right, son.
I'll see you tomorrow.

461
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,790
Hey, Sam, guess what?

462
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,150
We got a place to stay.

463
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,390
Great.

464
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,440
<i>So far, the terrible weather
hasn't hit D.C. area,</i>

465
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,030
<i>but local residents aren't
taking any chances</i>

466
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,960
<i>as people stock up for
what is already being billed</i>

467
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,280
<i>as the worst storm
season on record.</i>

468
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,470
You better be sure about this Jack.

469
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,790
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.

470
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,310
And I hope to god it's wrong.

471
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,430
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.

472
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,270
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.

473
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,610
Professor Hall has some
new information

474
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,810
I think you should
take a look at it.

475
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,670
We just got these results
from our simulation model.

476
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,800
They explain what's causing
this severe weather.

477
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,230
Look, I have to read this later.

478
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,320
I have a meeting with the
director of FEMA right now.

479
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,630
This is very urgent sir.

480
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,540
Our climate is changing violently.

481
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,990
And it's going to happen over
the next six to eight weeks.

482
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,790
I bet you said this wouldn't happen
for another 100 years or so.

483
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,630
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

484
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,760
I wish that I were,

485
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,090
but I'm sure that you're aware of
what's happening all around the world.

486
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,160
We're making all the necessary
preparations for this storm.

487
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,470
What more do you expect?

488
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,510
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

489
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,430
Especially in the Northern states.

490
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,150
- Evacuations?
- Yes.

491
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,830
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.

492
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,610
Mr. Vice President!

493
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,990
If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

494
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,030
Come on, Jack.

495
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,030
Hey. Thanks for bringing us here.

496
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,520
I couldn't let you leave New York

497
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,740
without seeing the
Natural History Museum.

498
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,040
Of course not.

499
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,280
It's the world's finest
collection of stuffed animals.

500
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,590
Hey, guys, check this out.

501
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,100
"The body of this mammoth
was found

502
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,050
perfectly preserved
in the Siberian tundra

503
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,390
with food still in its mouth
and stomach

504
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:23,750
indicating that it froze
instantly while grazing."

505
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,140
<i>It's been 24 hours now since
the snow started falling</i>

506
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,310
<i>across the British Isles
and over Northern Europe.</i>

507
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,190
<i>It shows no signs of letting up.</i>

508
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,150
No, no, no. You've got to
stop worrying. No, no.

509
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,070
It's fine. We've got plenty of
supplies. We're just snowed in.

510
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,910
Yeah. No, it's all right.
It's all right.

511
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,110
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.

512
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,190
Yeah, I love you too.
Okay, bye.

513
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,470
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.

514
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,590
The ferry just landed.

515
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,540
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.

516
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,430
<i>An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter</i>

517
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,270
<i>to airlift the royal family to safety.</i>

518
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,590
Yeah, you think they'll come get us
since we got snowed in?

519
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,690
Not likely.

520
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,720
Luckily we've got our
own genny,

521
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,920
enough tea and biscuits
to sink a ship.

522
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,630
Oh, we'll be fine.

523
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,270
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

524
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,660
<i>We've got zero visibility.</i>

525
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,640
- Maintain heading and speed.
- What's our heading?

526
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,110
035, sir.

527
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:50,190
Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmoral Castle.

528
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,990
<i>We've lost visual contact with you.</i>

529
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,870
<i>- This gauge here can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.</i>

530
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,030
<i>We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.</i>

531
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,680
What the hell is going on?

532
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
The bloody fuel lines
are starting to freeze.

533
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,480
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.

534
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,190
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

535
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,790
Prepare for crash landing.

536
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,830
Select emergency fuel.

537
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,550
Come on, you bastard!

538
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,710
Come on!

539
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,030
What I'm about to tell you
is supposed to be confidential.

540
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,910
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

541
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,550
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

542
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,590
<i>- At what temperature does...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

543
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,110
<i>We had to look it up.</i>

544
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,750
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

545
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,630
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

546
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,440
Can you get me a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

547
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,350
Yeah.

548
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,110
We've got mountains of data

549
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,120
but nowhere near enough
computer power to analyze it.

550
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
Can you help us?

551
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,390
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

552
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,590
<i>Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.</i>

553
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,070
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

554
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,790
This thing looks just like a hurricane.

555
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,950
Only hurricanes don't form over land.

556
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,830
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.

557
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,750
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.

558
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,870
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.

559
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,430
Wow.

560
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,230
You live here?

561
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,130
Just on the weekends.
It's...

562
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,110
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so...

563
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,670
Where is he?

564
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,990
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.

565
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,510
Is this you and your brother?

566
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,830
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

567
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,350
It's been raining like this
for three days now.

568
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,350
Come on, hurry up.

569
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,550
I'm just standing here.

570
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,550
You can't stay here.

571
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,990
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.

572
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,710
<i>It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.</i>

573
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,840
<i>Over half the platforms
are flooded</i>

574
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,200
<i>and service has been
suspended on all trains.</i>

575
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,390
<i>With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service</i>

576
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,270
<i>that's bad news for the...</i>

577
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,400
Hey, Victor's coming to pick me up.

578
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,930
You guys want a ride
to the train station?

579
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,990
Not anymore.

580
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:00,590
<i>In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.</i>

581
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,350
<i>What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.</i>

582
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,630
<i>The cold front moving down
from the Arctic</i>

583
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,470
<i>has created an enormous
storm system in Canada.</i>

584
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,060
<i>Which, incredible as it sounds,</i>

585
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,510
<i>looks more and more like
a tropical hurricane...</i>

586
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,670
Well, I gotta go pick up
my little brother.

587
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,050
Do you guys want me to
give you a ride?

588
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,180
Where is he?

589
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,030
He's in a boarding school
in Philadelphia.

590
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,070
<i>If this system moves south</i>

591
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,390
<i>we could see a wind-driven
storm surge</i>

592
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,840
<i>that could threaten
the entire Eastern Seaboard.</i>

593
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,030
Okay, bye.

594
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,710
Victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

595
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,420
It'll be easier to head straight out of
town if we just meet him over there.

596
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,280
All right.

597
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,070
You mean walk?
No, not in this.

598
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,710
We should take the stairs.

599
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,510
We're on the top floor.

600
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,110
I guess we're walking.

601
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,150
Maybe we should just stay here.

602
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,950
I think the young lady is right sir.

603
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,790
No. We need to get home.

604
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,430
Hey, Cesar, come here.

605
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,670
What are you doing?

606
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,470
The wolves, they're gone.

607
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,830
<i>Just to give you an idea
of the situation</i>

608
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,150
<i>which seems to be becoming
worse with each passing minute.</i>

609
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:57,870
<i>At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.</i>

610
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:01,440
<i>We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out</i>

611
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,110
<i>to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.</i>

612
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,630
<i>Car accidents, at least two hundred.</i>

613
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,490
<i>And lower Manhattan,
we've been told,</i>

614
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,190
<i>is virtually inaccessible.</i>

615
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,710
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

616
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:36,950
Hey.

617
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,790
That dog can't come in here.

618
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,430
Come on, man.
It's pouring out there.

619
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,830
I don't care. Read the sign.

620
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,590
It's supposed to be a public library.

621
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,870
Come on, guys, this way.

622
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,150
Excuse me. You're bad.

623
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,550
Goddamn 1500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.

624
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,590
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.

625
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,270
That's because it's New York.

626
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,270
Hey! Hey!

627
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,110
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.

628
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,390
It's out of service.

629
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,820
No, no. I'll give you 100 dollars
to put it in service.

630
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,730
You don't have to do that.

631
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,270
No, no, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it. I won't have it.

632
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,340
Oh god, I love buses.
This is so much fun.

633
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,890
This is gonna be the bomb.

634
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,710
Hello?

635
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,680
I can't reach my driver.

636
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,990
- I lost the signal.
- This is insane.

637
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,660
We're not gonna be able to
drive anywhere.

638
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,920
We should just go back to
your apartment.

639
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,030
Yeah, I vote for that.

640
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,280
What? Are you kidding?
We have to get higher!

641
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,070
Come on.

642
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,470
Up to the library.

643
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,630
Calm down.

644
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,350
I can't understand what you're saying.

645
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,350
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.

646
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,950
The door is jammed!

647
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,310
I don't speak French!

648
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,190
Hey, where's Laura?

649
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,350
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?

650
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,030
What is she doing?

651
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,840
Tell them to cover their eyes.

652
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,190
<i>There is a wall of water
coming towards New York City.</i>

653
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,290
<i>Everybody...</i>

654
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,810
What? What's the problem?

655
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,750
She left her bag in the cab.
Their passports.

656
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,990
Forget about it.

657
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,310
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.

658
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,150
Oh, my...

659
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,510
Laura!

660
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,350
Laura!

661
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,750
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!

662
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,150
Laura! Laura, look!

663
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,950
Come on. Come!

664
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,350
Come on!

665
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,830
Sam!

666
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,530
No!

667
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,750
Professor.

668
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,150
Thank you.

669
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,910
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.

670
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,870
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.

671
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,990
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

672
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,350
God. I can't believe
Neville's 6 already.

673
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,150
You won't believe
how fast they grow.

674
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,310
Professor.
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.

675
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,870
They've run the data
we've sent them.

676
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,950
Here he is.

677
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:03,270
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

678
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,440
Yes. The storm's rotation is
pulling super-cooled air

679
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,630
all the way down
from the upper troposphere.

680
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,530
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

681
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,150
<i>It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.</i>

682
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,630
Is this an isolated incident?

683
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,110
I'm afraid not.

684
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,410
We've located two other super cells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

685
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,430
There is one over Northern Canada

686
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,630
<i>and another one over Siberia.</i>

687
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,390
And do we know
their projected paths?

688
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,360
<i>Yes.</i>

689
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,310
<i>Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren't even close.</i>

690
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,990
<i>This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.</i>

691
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,030
<i>Here's a projection of 24 hours out.</i>

692
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,030
This is 48 hours out.

693
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,710
<i>And in seven to ten days...</i>

694
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,070
<i>When this storm is over</i>

695
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,070
<i>we'll be in a new Ice Age.</i>

696
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,470
My god.

697
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,070
Professor...

698
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,270
It's time you got out of there.

699
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,430
I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

700
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,750
What can we do?

701
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,510
Save as many as you can.

702
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,470
Jack.

703
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,550
Something's happened in New York.

704
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,040
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.

705
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,230
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.

706
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,990
What?

707
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,790
This is the last one. Enjoy it.

708
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,350
Greedy.

709
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:52,030
<i>All circuits are busy at this time.</i>

710
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,190
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

711
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,710
It was really brave.

712
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,190
I guess I better return her bag.

713
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,510
Sam?

714
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,430
Just tell her how you feel.

715
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,470
Yeah.

716
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,380
Did you reach your
little brother yet?

717
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,260
No, there's still no service.

718
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,910
Damn cell phones.

719
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,380
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

720
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,480
Are there any pay phones
on the upper floors?

721
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,690
No, no, no.

722
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,730
Ah. But there are some
on the mezzanine.

723
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:01,510
Great.

724
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:04,590
- Oh, but I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.

725
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,270
Older payphones draw their power
directly from the telephone line.

726
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,990
<i>There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads...</i>

727
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,630
Oh, god. I've been
trying to reach Sam.

728
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:15,850
So have I.

729
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,870
I tried to call you
but I couldn't get through.

730
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,350
It's been a madhouse around here.
Come on.

731
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,230
Are you sure about this?

732
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,590
It works.

733
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,470
I love that picture.

734
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,870
Yeah, so do I.

735
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,190
Where was that taken?

736
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,550
Miami.

737
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,510
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.

738
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,470
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska,

739
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,550
doing research on your doctorate.

740
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:09,310
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

741
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,990
Everything was "one more."

742
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,640
One more bedtime story.

743
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,940
One more ride on my shoulders.
"One more, daddy."

744
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:23,190
Jack. Sam's on the phone.
Line four.

745
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,230
- Sam?
- Dad!

746
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:26,620
<i>Where are you?
Are you all right?</i>

747
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,570
I'm all right.
We're at the Public Library.

748
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,260
<i>Sam, it's Mom.</i>

749
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,810
- I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.

750
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,270
Can you call Laura and
Brian's parents

751
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,770
and tell them we're all right?

752
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,550
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

753
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,950
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?

754
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,430
Sam?

755
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,950
<i>What is going on out there, dad?</i>

756
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,310
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

757
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,870
Listen very carefully.

758
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,150
Forget what I said about
trying to head south.

759
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,510
It's too late for that.
The storm is just gonna get worse.

760
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,770
<i>It's gonna turn into
a massive blizzard</i>

761
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,470
<i>with an eye in the center of it,
just like a huge hurricane.</i>

762
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,570
Uh huh.

763
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:06,910
Only the air is gonna be so cold.
You could freeze to death in seconds.

764
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,750
Sam?

765
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,290
Well, what should we do?

766
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,690
Listen to me, son.

767
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,950
Do not go outside.

768
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,740
Just burn whatever you can
to stay warm,

769
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,990
and try to wait it out.

770
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:22,570
I will come for you.
Do you understand me?

771
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,920
I will come for you.

772
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,390
Sam?

773
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,200
- Sam, come back!

774
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,420
- Sam?
- Sam?

775
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,390
<i>Sam, did you hear me?</i>

776
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,830
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

777
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,430
Sam?

778
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:45,030
- Tell me he's gonna be okay...
- He's gonna be all right.

779
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,230
He's gonna be all right,
do you understand me?

780
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,950
I thought you'd drowned.

781
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,550
Let's find some dry clothes
for you. Come on.

782
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,270
Where'd you store
the arctic gear?

783
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,270
You can't make it
to New York, Jack.

784
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:38,790
I've walked that far before
in the snow.

785
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,350
This is not the same.

786
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:45,790
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

787
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,310
I have to do this.

788
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:53,870
I know.

789
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,270
My hands are shak...

790
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:06,870
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.

791
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,990
Here. Come here.

792
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,550
What are you doing?

793
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,190
I'm using my body heat
to warm you.

794
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,590
If we let the blood

795
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,540
from your arms and legs rush
back to your heart too quickly

796
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,270
your heart could fail.

797
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,790
Where did you learn that?

798
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:38,830
Some of us were actually
paying attention in health class.

799
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,190
How are you feeling?

800
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,430
Much better.

801
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,790
Frank told me about Sam.

802
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,820
I'm not gonna try to
talk you out of going,

803
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,740
but there's something I need
for you do first.

804
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,010
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

805
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,070
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.

806
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,910
You're gonna brief
the President directly.

807
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,670
- Is that the last of it?
- Yeah. Pretty much.

808
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:15,870
Okay.

809
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,670
We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.

810
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,790
Let me see it.

811
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,050
Buddha, keep quiet.

812
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,950
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

813
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,950
Come on, guys.

814
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,790
Oh, my god.

815
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,800
The basic rule of storms
is that they continue

816
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,310
until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

817
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,230
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

818
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:14,330
This superstorm will last
seven to ten days.

819
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,410
When it's over,

820
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:19,150
ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

821
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,310
The ice and snow
will reflect sunlight.

822
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,610
The Earth's atmosphere
will restabilize

823
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,110
but with an average temperature
close to that of the last Ice Age.

824
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,350
Well, what can we do about this?

825
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,870
Head as far south as possible.

826
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,150
That is not amusing, professor.

827
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,590
Where do you suggest they go?

828
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:43,190
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

829
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,230
Texas. Parts of Florida
that aren't flooded.

830
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,040
Mexico would be best.

831
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,830
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

832
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,510
Well, we tried that approach.

833
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,140
You didn't want to hear
about the science

834
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,790
when it could have
made a difference.

835
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,970
What exactly are you proposing,
professor?

836
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:13,210
Evacuate everyone south of that line.

837
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,210
What about the people in the North?

838
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,930
I'm afraid it's too late for them.

839
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,250
If they go outside

840
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,330
the storm will kill them.

841
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,490
At this point

842
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,330
their best chance is
to stay inside.

843
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,530
Try to ride it out.

844
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,330
Pray.

845
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,370
What do you think he'll do?

846
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,410
I don't know.

847
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:54,570
Jack.

848
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,170
Thanks...

849
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,690
and good luck.

850
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,490
You too.

851
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,810
We're all gonna need it.

852
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,340
We can't evacuate half the country

853
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,490
because one scientist
thinks the climate is shifting.

854
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,980
Every minute we delay
is costing lives.

855
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,640
What about the other half
of the country?

856
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,210
If Professor Hall is right
about this storm pattern

857
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,990
sending troops north will
create more victims.

858
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,340
We need to save the people
we can right now.

859
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,570
We take the same approach
in triage on the battlefield.

860
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,790
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices...

861
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:33,880
I don't accept that abandoning
half the country is necessary.

862
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,310
Maybe if you would've listened to
him sooner, it wouldn't be.

863
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,600
Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

864
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,390
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.

865
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:46,940
I just thought that
you should know that

866
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,690
before you start
questioning his motives.

867
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,550
We're going to follow Hall's plan.

868
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,310
- General.
- Sir?

869
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,780
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate the southern states.

870
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,630
Yes, sir.

871
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,750
Vivian...

872
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,750
get me my wife.

873
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:43,150
Sorry, mates, but we're
just about out of petrol.

874
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,470
Hey.

875
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,990
Is there any chance...

876
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,070
that it'll run...

877
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,990
on this?

878
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:57,030
Are you mad?

879
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,550
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.

880
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,630
Gentlemen.

881
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,710
To England.

882
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,470
To mankind.

883
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,430
To Manchester United.

884
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,550
I just...

885
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,630
I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?

886
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,150
The important thing is
he will grow up.

887
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,150
Amen.

888
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,270
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that, you know.

889
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:21,710
Sir, I am president of the
Electronics Club

890
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:24,150
the Math Club
and the Chess Club.

891
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,390
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.

892
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:32,710
I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

893
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,990
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

894
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,990
Look, there's nobody around.

895
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,140
OK. You know what?

896
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,290
I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.

897
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,190
What?

898
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,430
Hey, man, there is people out there.

899
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,970
I was walking my dog.

900
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:03,350
There is hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

901
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,570
Where they all going?

902
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:15,910
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

903
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:21,630
All right, everybody. Quiet down.

904
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,890
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

905
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,950
Well, I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

906
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,990
They're being
evacuated to the South.

907
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,530
We should get moving too.

908
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:34,510
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

909
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,870
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

910
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:41,630
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

911
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,310
- We shouldn't go.
- We're leaving in five minutes.

912
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,350
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

913
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:48,190
When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

914
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,110
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.

915
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,030
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.

916
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:59,710
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

917
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,790
What? Listen son, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

918
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,550
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.

919
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:08,190
If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!

920
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,830
Okay, what is this nonsense?

921
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,670
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

922
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:17,270
The people who are caught outside
they will freeze to death.

923
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,230
- Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.

924
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,990
- He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?

925
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,830
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

926
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,150
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

927
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,910
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies...

928
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:33,150
- It's a risk, yeah...
- An unnecessary risk.

929
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,550
No, no. It's not.

930
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:37,150
We've wasted enough time talking about this.
Come on, people

931
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,390
Let's go.

932
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,610
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody...

933
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:42,740
- One second.
- Let's get going.

934
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,790
The storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.

935
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,070
You're not gonna
be able to survive it.

936
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,670
Believe me.

937
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:55,110
Sir, please just stay.
Just stay.

938
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,110
Just don't...

939
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:30,350
She's set to go.
Come on, straight to the back, guys.

940
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,410
<i>It'll be impossible to reach each other.</i>

941
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:35,330
<i>Leave a message for me at the
American Embassy in Mexico City.</i>

942
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,830
Okay, I will.

943
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,950
I love you.

944
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,750
I love you, Jack.

945
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,510
Tell Sam I love him so much.

946
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:52,950
God be with you.

947
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,150
- Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.

948
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,710
We haven't been able to
reach Peter's parents.

949
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:08,430
- I'm gonna try it later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

950
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:17,630
I got it.

951
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,270
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

952
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:23,520
I've been watching your back
for 20 years.

953
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,890
You think I'd let you go alone?

954
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,350
All these years I thought
I was watching your back.

955
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,270
Where are the keys?

956
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,190
In the truck.

957
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,190
Where do you think you're going?

958
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:38,790
Neither one of you knows how to
navigate worth a damn.

959
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,950
Without me,
you'll end up in Cleveland.

960
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:46,350
I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

961
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,870
Good luck, Jack.

962
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,310
Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.

963
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,710
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border

964
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:12,750
in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south

965
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,670
in the wake of the
approaching storm.

966
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:18,230
These people came here in
anticipation of crossing into Mexico.

967
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,490
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

968
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:24,110
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration

969
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,830
thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

970
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,660
The scene that unfolding
here behind me

971
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,730
is one of desperation
and frustration.

972
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:35,350
People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings

973
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:40,110
and they are wading across
the river illegally into Mexico.

974
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,110
Here it is.

975
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,990
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 100 years.

976
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,430
All right.

977
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,710
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we're gonna burn?

978
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:06,230
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.

979
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,150
You wanna freeze to death?

980
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:13,310
I'll go get some more.

981
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:14,990
I'll help you.

982
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,550
I'm going with them.

983
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,250
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

984
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:24,350
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

985
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,790
We're not gonna last very long
on MandM's and potato chips.

986
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:37,150
What about the garbage cans?

987
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:39,830
There's always something
to eat in the garbage.

988
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:46,630
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can not burn Nietzsche.

989
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,830
He was the most important
thinker of the 19th century.

990
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:52,950
Please. Nietzsche was a chauvinist
pig who was in love with his sister.

991
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,750
He was not a chauvinist pig.

992
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,230
But he was in love
with his sister.

993
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,070
Excuse me? you guys?

994
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,800
Yeah, there's a whole section
on tax law down here

995
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,900
that we can burn.

996
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:07,070
<i>After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly</i>

997
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,300
<i>from the United States into Mexico.</i>

998
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,190
<i>This is only possible because the
president was able to negotiate a deal</i>

999
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:17,990
<i>to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.</i>

1000
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:22,310
<i>Now, multitudes of American
families are feeling a rush of relief...</i>

1001
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,990
Lucy?

1002
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,070
Is Peter's ambulance here?

1003
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,230
No.

1004
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:44,590
- Why?
- They've all gone.

1005
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,350
- What?
- In the confusion...

1006
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:47,660
I don't know what happened.

1007
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,040
People just started to panic,
and they left, and...

1008
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,640
- God.
- Now there's a policeman with a snowplow.

1009
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:55,270
- He's waiting outside.
- God.

1010
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,870
Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.

1011
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:02,950
I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.

1012
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:11,590
Okay.

1013
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:16,830
Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.

1014
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,670
Lucy, no.

1015
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,670
- No.
- No, you should go.

1016
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:22,790
He's not gonna wait forever.

1017
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,830
It's okay.

1018
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:29,390
I'm sorry.

1019
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:33,070
- It's okay.
- All right.

1020
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:02,990
You all right?

1021
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:06,150
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I cut my leg the other day.

1022
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:11,630
Did you get a signal?

1023
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,870
Yeah, for a minute.

1024
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,030
And?

1025
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,510
Man, this storm is everywhere.

1026
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,110
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.

1027
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:27,350
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow

1028
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:30,270
and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

1029
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:33,590
I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

1030
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,030
No, he'll make it.

1031
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,670
He'll make it.

1032
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:53,030
<i>The White House has ordered
the following national disaster alert</i>

1033
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,380
<i>for all Northern states.</i>

1034
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,510
<i>Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.</i>

1035
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:00,190
<i>Remain indoors and
take all measures to stay warm,</i>

1036
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,910
<i>burning any fuel sources
until the storm is over. </i>

1037
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,500
<i>The Roads are impassable
across New York State</i>

1038
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,660
<i>as far south as Pennsylvania...</i>

1039
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,190
Where are we?

1040
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:15,070
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.

1041
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,950
Look out!

1042
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,030
You guys okay?

1043
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:27,590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1044
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:35,240
<i>Once again, the roads across the...</i>

1045
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,340
Sorry, boss.

1046
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,990
Unpack the snowshoes.

1047
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:42,110
We're walking from here.

1048
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:46,510
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

1049
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:51,390
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

1050
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:54,000
What for? Half the city's
frozen under water.

1051
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,230
There's nothing to go back to.

1052
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,510
Time to get up and keep moving.

1053
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,480
What we should've done
is stayed in the library.

1054
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:59,580
Come on, man.

1055
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,230
Okay, guys, let's get moving.

1056
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,390
Wake up.

1057
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,830
What are you doing?

1058
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:36,670
Insulating.

1059
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:39,310
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

1060
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,360
You know, you spend some
years on the streets

1061
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,830
and you learn how to keep warm.

1062
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:45,590
Hey.

1063
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,070
Thanks.

1064
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:59,150
I got one.

1065
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:01,390
Your favorite vacation.

1066
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,030
Besides this one?

1067
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,900
All right.

1068
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,590
I went to Greenland with my dad

1069
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:10,840
on one of his research trips
a few years ago...

1070
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:18,630
and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

1071
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:22,270
And it rained constantly.

1072
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,430
That sounds really boring.

1073
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,110
But actually really nice, you know?

1074
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:33,710
Just me and my dad
hanging out for 10 days.

1075
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,510
Frank!

1076
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:50,030
Are you all right?

1077
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,390
I'm fine.

1078
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,870
I just dropped in
to do a little shopping.

1079
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:58,750
I gotta lose this sled.

1080
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,830
Hold on! We'll pull you up.

1081
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,270
Jason! you've got to support
Frank's weight.

1082
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:26,230
Okay, I'll try.

1083
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,230
Okay, I think I have his weight now.

1084
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,110
I'm coming to you.

1085
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:52,470
The glass is breaking!

1086
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,110
Too much weight.

1087
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:01,510
It's not gonna hold.

1088
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,590
No. No.

1089
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,910
Frank. I can get you out.

1090
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:19,790
Don't do it!

1091
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:22,390
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!

1092
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:25,230
Frank!

1093
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:11,310
What have you got there?

1094
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:14,590
A Gutenberg Bible.

1095
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,110
It was in the rare books room.

1096
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:20,110
You think god's gonna save you?

1097
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:23,630
No. I don't believe in god.

1098
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:26,990
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

1099
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:29,150
I'm protecting it.

1100
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:36,150
This Bible is the first book
ever printed.

1101
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:41,950
It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

1102
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,270
As far as I'm concerned,

1103
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,580
the written word is mankind's
greatest achievement.

1104
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,230
You can laugh.

1105
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:52,390
But if Western civilization
is finished

1106
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:56,990
I'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.

1107
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,870
We heard somebody
was left behind.

1108
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:40,510
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank god.

1109
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:45,710
Thank you so much for coming.

1110
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:07,670
Hey.

1111
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,310
Hey, are you all right?

1112
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:14,710
You look like you have a fever
or something.

1113
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,990
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

1114
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:26,470
My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.

1115
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,400
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.

1116
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:34,030
I guess you just haven't had
time to adjust yet.

1117
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,390
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?

1118
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:42,910
Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for

1119
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:47,070
has all been preparation for
a future that no longer exists.

1120
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:54,590
I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.

1121
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,710
You were right.

1122
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:01,310
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I...

1123
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:06,510
No, I just... I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

1124
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:09,550
Truth about what?

1125
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:16,990
About why I joined the team.

1126
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,270
I joined it because of you.

1127
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,390
Hey.

1128
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,070
I know.

1129
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,950
I know.

1130
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:10,190
- Mr. President.
- All right.

1131
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,350
I'm sorry, sir,
we can't wait any longer.

1132
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:15,870
We're the last ones.

1133
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:18,350
All right.

1134
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,880
<i>Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.</i>

1135
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,220
<i>We've got an urgent message
for high command.</i>

1136
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,070
<i>Request priority
for landing zone one.</i>

1137
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:45,190
<i>Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.</i>

1138
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:51,670
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.

1139
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:53,990
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.

1140
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:08,670
Madam Secretary.

1141
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:19,830
Raymond.

1142
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:23,270
The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.

1143
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:29,950
They didn't make it.

1144
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:38,430
And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. I...

1145
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,480
I mean last night
she only had a fever.

1146
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,550
I don't understand.

1147
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:43,790
She's awfully pale.

1148
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:44,870
Well guys, look.

1149
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:46,710
None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.

1150
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:49,670
- I'm telling you it's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?

1151
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:52,090
- We've all been in...
- Look maybe it's just the flu, you guys.

1152
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:54,390
No, no, it's not the flu.

1153
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:56,790
And how do you know?

1154
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,320
Books can be good for
something other than burning.

1155
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,860
All right,
let's go for her symptoms?

1156
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,290
I told you that she has
a fever and her...

1157
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:04,410
She's got a really cold sweat.

1158
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:05,750
How's her pulse?

1159
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:09,700
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?

1160
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,270
Like a cut or something that
might have gotten infected?

1161
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:15,950
She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

1162
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,350
I didn't think anything of it.

1163
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,510
Oh, my gosh.

1164
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,870
That's blood poisoning.
Uh, Septicemia.

1165
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:32,190
She could go into septic shock.

1166
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,980
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.

1167
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,290
She needs a massive dose
of penicillin...

1168
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:40,430
or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or...

1169
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,790
Or what?

1170
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:09,910
I've never seen anything like it.

1171
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:13,750
There's no point of reference.
All I could see is cloud cover.

1172
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:15,430
What are you doing?

1173
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:17,950
Taking infrared image of
thermal currents.

1174
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:22,830
Send to Houston, Korolev,
your weather service.

1175
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,590
I'll help you.

1176
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:28,110
Tom? Tom, wake up.

1177
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:30,620
I just received some satellite
images from the space station.

1178
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,720
You better take a look.

1179
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,710
How big is this thing?

1180
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:47,910
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.

1181
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:51,750
And growing. The two cells
over Europe and Asia are even bigger.

1182
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:53,230
Good god.

1183
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:56,350
This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.

1184
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:14,030
Jason!

1185
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,110
Are you all right?

1186
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:17,790
Jason!

1187
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:35,430
What are you doing?

1188
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,730
There's gotta be medicine
on that ship.

1189
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:41,350
I thought you said it was too
dangerous to go outside.

1190
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,830
I know I did.

1191
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:51,550
Where did you find those chairs?

1192
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:53,910
Why?

1193
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:56,670
I'm going with you.

1194
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,550
Me too.

1195
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,030
Come on, damn it!

1196
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,150
- It's all in Russian. I...
- I know.

1197
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:59,790
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?

1198
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:02,590
Because it says "penicillin"
on the bottle.

1199
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,670
Hey, wait a minute.
This is the mess hall.

1200
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,110
We should find some food
while we're here.

1201
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:12,160
No. We don't have time.

1202
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,460
Listen, none of us are gonna survive
much longer without food, okay?

1203
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,560
Including Laura.

1204
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:18,630
Okay.

1205
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:26,390
- Sam, over here.
- What?

1206
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,150
Bingo.

1207
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:40,910
Brian?

1208
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:44,750
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

1209
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,740
All I did was open up
the cupboard.

1210
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:51,110
- Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.

1211
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:55,210
Run!

1212
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:06,030
Pull him in, Brian!

1213
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:11,950
- You all right?
- Oh, my god, there's more.

1214
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:15,550
My leg.

1215
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,710
Here, use this.

1216
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,310
It should be over
New York by now.

1217
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:33,340
Satellite readings are showing

1218
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,890
a temperature drop of
10 degrees per second.

1219
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:53,670
You guys...

1220
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,910
I think we're in the eye of it.

1221
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:58,870
We gotta get back right now.

1222
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:02,140
Look, I'm gonna go outside,

1223
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,090
and I'm gonna lure
the wolves out of the room.

1224
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:06,910
When they leave,
you lock the door.

1225
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:08,710
Good luck.

1226
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:17,270
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.

1227
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:19,950
Come on, hurry!

1228
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,870
Brian! Brian, open the door!

1229
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:38,550
We have to get out of here now.

1230
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,870
Brian, get the supplies.

1231
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,990
Let's go!

1232
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:41,910
Pull, Brian!

1233
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:20,230
Take the medicine to Laura.

1234
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:54,670
We're almost there.
Come on!

1235
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:58,630
Brian! Close the door!

1236
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:12,150
Don't let the fire go out!

1237
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:14,070
What's happening?

1238
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,510
Buddha,
come away from the door.

1239
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:25,150
Come, Buddha, come!

1240
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:28,630
More books! More books!

1241
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:24,430
How long have I been
out of it?

1242
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:27,270
Couple hours.

1243
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:28,950
How do you feel?

1244
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:31,990
Okay. What happened?

1245
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,780
Well, we had to get inside
in kind of a hurry,

1246
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,690
so I, uh... sort of pushed you in.

1247
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:40,070
I should be used to you
pushing me around.

1248
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,550
Good to have you back.

1249
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:50,550
What are you doing?

1250
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:53,460
The eye of the storm
has passed,

1251
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,940
and we're 40 miles
from Manhattan.

1252
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,750
Jack, shouldn't we wait
one more day?

1253
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:03,150
Sam may not have one more day.

1254
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:17,710
What do you think's gonna
happen to us?

1255
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:19,910
What do you mean?

1256
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:25,710
I mean us. Civilization.
Everybody.

1257
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:30,990
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.

1258
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:34,430
We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

1259
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:39,230
All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.

1260
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:45,110
I sure as hell would like
a chance to learn from mine.

1261
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:48,550
You did everything you could.

1262
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:53,710
I was thinking about Sam.

1263
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:02,630
Jack, you know the
chances of Sam...

1264
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:16,670
I made my son a promise.

1265
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:19,830
I'm going to keep it.

1266
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:46,390
<i>Parker, this is Houston.
Do you read?</i>

1267
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,550
Roger, mission control.
Go ahead.

1268
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,100
<i>We're getting scattered reports</i>

1269
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,850
<i>that the storm is dissipating
over North America.</i>

1270
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:54,950
<i>Can you confirm?</i>

1271
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:59,870
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.

1272
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:01,970
We're over Europe right now.

1273
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:05,350
I can see landmass
for the first time in days.

1274
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:58,070
How much further is it
to the library?

1275
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:00,070
It should be...

1276
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:04,670
right here.

1277
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:10,990
I'm sorry, Jack.

1278
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:49,750
Sam?

1279
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:01,350
Who is that?

1280
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,150
My father.

1281
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:15,390
You made it.

1282
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:21,710
Of course I did.

1283
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:14,590
Mr. President.

1284
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:19,990
I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.

1285
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:22,190
He made it to New York.

1286
01:51:22,910 --> 01:51:24,750
He says there are survivors.

1287
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:28,270
Thank you, Tom.

1288
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:30,870
That's...

1289
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:33,670
That's good news.

1290
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:48,190
<i>These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility</i>

1291
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:51,630
<i>in the face of nature's
destructive power.</i>

1292
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:55,510
<i>For years, we operated under
the belief that we could continue</i>

1293
01:51:55,670 --> 01:52:01,310
<i>consuming our planet's natural
resources without consequence.</i>

1294
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:03,950
<i>We were wrong.</i>

1295
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:07,230
<i>I was wrong.</i>

1296
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:09,870
<i>The fact that my first
address to you</i>

1297
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:12,240
<i>comes from a consulate
on foreign soil</i>

1298
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:16,110
<i>is a testament to our
changed reality.</i>

1299
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:18,190
<i>Not only Americans</i>

1300
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:21,910
<i>but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations</i>

1301
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:24,870
<i>we once called
The Third World.</i>

1302
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:29,350
<i>In our time of need, they have
taken us in and sheltered us.</i>

1303
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:33,590
<i>And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.</i>

1304
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:57,220
<i>We mourn the loss of
a spirited leader</i>

1305
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,130
<i>whose courageous order
to evacuate...</i>

1306
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:04,190
Peter? Hey.
You feeling okay today?

1307
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:07,340
<i>For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people</i>

1308
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,750
<i>who are trapped in the North.</i>

1309
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:13,430
<i>Today, there is cause for hope.</i>

1310
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:15,780
<i>Only a few hours ago,</i>

1311
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:20,030
<i>I received word that a small group
of people survived in New York City</i>

1312
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:23,960
<i>against all odds and in the face
of tremendous adversity.</i>

1313
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:27,090
<i>I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission</i>

1314
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:31,430
<i>to bring them home and
to look for more survivors.</i>

1315
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,270
Jack!

1316
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:07,710
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.

1317
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:05,030
Look at that.

1318
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:06,350
What?

1319
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:10,950
Have you ever seen
the air so clear?
