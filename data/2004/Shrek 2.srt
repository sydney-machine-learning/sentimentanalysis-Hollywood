1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, far away,

2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,600
the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

3
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,200
And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...

4
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,100
until the sun went down

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,100
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment

6
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,100
that took hold each and every night.

7
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,900
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,

9
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,700
there to await the kiss...
of the handsome Prince Charming.

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
It was he who would chance
the perilous journey

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,200
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,500
traveling for many days and nights,

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,700
risking life and limb

14
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,200
to reach the Dragon's keep.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,800
For he was the bravest,

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,400
and most handsome...

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
in all the land.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,600
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,800
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,500
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,800
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her...

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,900
What?

24
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,500
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,600
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,000
# So she said
what's the problem, baby?

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,700
# What's the problem?
I don't know

29
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
# Well, maybe I'm in love

30
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,200
# Think about it
every time I think 'bout it

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,500
# Can't stop thinking 'bout it

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
# How much longer
will it take to cure this?

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,100
# Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,400
# If it's love, love

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
# Makes me wanna turn around
and face me

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,300
# But I don't know nothing
'bout love

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,100
# Oh, come on, come on

38
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,300
# Turn a little faster

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,700
# Come on, come on

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
# The world will follow after

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,400
# Come on, come on

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,100
# Everybody's after love

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,700
# So I said
I'm a snowball running

44
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,500
# Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
# Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
# Shimmering love

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,500
# Well, baby, I surrender

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
# To the strawberry ice cream

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,500
# Never ever end of all this love

50
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,400
# Well, I didn't mean to do it

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,700
# But there's no escaping your love

52
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,400
# These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,400
# Never alone, no, no

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,000
# Come on, come on

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,900
# Jump a little higher

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
# Come on, come on

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,300
# If you feel a little lighter

58
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,400
# Come on, come on

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,800
# We were once upon a time in love

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Hyah!

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,500
# We're accidentally in love

62
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,300
# Accidentally in love

63
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,000
# Accidentally in love

64
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,400
# Accidentally in love

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,700
# Accidentally in love

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,100
# Accidentally in love

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,600
# Accidentally

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,900
# I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love

69
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,700
# I'm in love, I'm in love

70
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,200
# Accidentally in love

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,900
# I'm in love

72
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
# I'm in love?

73
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,800
It's so good to be home!

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,300
Just you and me and...

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,700
- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,400
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

77
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,600
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

78
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,900
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Donkey, what are you doing here?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,900
Taking care of your love nest for you.

81
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,400
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

82
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,200
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,300
You do now. I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,100
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

85
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,800
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,700
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,800
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,800
Oh, yeah, that.

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,500
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
I thought I'd move in with you.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,700
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

92
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,500
But Fiona and I are married now.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,700
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,700
Just with each other.

95
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,100
Alone.

96
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,700
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

98
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,400
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,700
You're bothering me.

100
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,300
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,100
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,000
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh.

105
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,800
I think I remember.

106
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,400
Donkey!

107
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,500
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
What do you want me
to tell these other guys?

109
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,000
Enough, Reggie.

110
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,600
"Dearest Princess Fiona.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,600
"You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

112
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,300
"for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

113
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
"at which time the King

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,300
"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your..."

115
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
uh... "Prince Charming.

116
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,000
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

117
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,300
"aka Mom and Dad."

118
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,600
Mom and Dad?

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,000
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
- We're not going.
- What?

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,700
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

122
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
shocked to see you like this?

123
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,100
Well, they might be
a bit surprised.

124
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,300
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

125
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,400
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

126
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah, right.

127
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,200
Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome
at the country club.

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
Stop it.
They're not like that.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,500
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

130
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,800
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

131
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

132
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,700
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

133
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,800
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,100
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

135
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Who says I want
to be part of this family?

136
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,100
You did!
When you married me!

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
Well, there's some fine print for you!

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,100
So that's it. You won't come?

139
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,400
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

140
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,600
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,900
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

142
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Hey, wait for me. Oof!

143
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,400
# Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!

144
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,700
# Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!

145
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,000
# Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,400
# Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
# Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!

148
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,900
# Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,500
# Rawhide!?
Yee-haw!

150
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,300
- Are we there yet?
- No.

151
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,100
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,200
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,900
- Are we there yet?
- No!

154
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
- Really?
- No!

156
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,700
- Are we there yet?
- No!

157
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,500
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

158
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,100
- Are we there yet?
- No!

159
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Are we there yet?

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
That's not funny. That's really immature.

161
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,400
This is why nobody likes ogres.

162
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Your loss!

163
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,000
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,600
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

165
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,300
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

166
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,500
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

167
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
away!

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,600
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,200
Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.

170
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,500
For five minutes...

171
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Could you not be yourself...

172
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,900
...for five minutes!

173
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,300
Are we there yet?

174
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,000
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

175
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Wow!

176
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,800
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

177
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,500
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

178
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,300
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

179
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,500
Halt!

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,500
Hey, everyone, look.

181
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Swimming pools!
Movie stars!

183
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,900
Announcing the long-awaited return

184
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,400
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

185
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,700
Well, this is it.

186
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
- This is it.
- This is it.

187
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,900
This is it.

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,100
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

189
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,100
So...

190
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,100
you still think
this was a good idea?

191
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,500
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

192
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,600
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that's our little girl.

193
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,900
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

194
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,100
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

195
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,300
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

196
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,800
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

197
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

198
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,500
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

199
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
That was for my own...

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

201
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,900
Harold, we have to be...

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,900
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

203
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

204
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,200
A disaster! There is no way...

205
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,800
- You can do this.
- I really...

206
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,300
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...

207
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Here!

208
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,300
Mom... Dad...

209
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,400
I'd like you to meet my husband...

210
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,200
Shrek.

211
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,300
Well, um...

212
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,600
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

213
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
Excuse me.

214
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,900
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?

215
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,900
That's good.

216
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,500
I guess not.

217
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,000
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

218
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,500
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

219
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,000
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

220
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,600
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

221
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,100
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.

222
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

223
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh, boy.

224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

225
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,200
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.

226
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Mmm!

227
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
No, no. Darling.

228
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,900
Oh!

229
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,300
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

230
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
Well...

231
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,100
Shrek owns his own land.

232
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,400
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

233
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,200
It's in an enchanted forest

234
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,900
abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

235
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,100
What?

236
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

237
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,500
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

238
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,300
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

239
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,900
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

240
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,900
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

241
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

243
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,000
I got to go to the bathroom.

244
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,600
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,100
Bon appetit!

246
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.

247
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,200
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

248
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,500
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

249
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,300
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

250
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,600
Ogres, yes!

251
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

252
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,300
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

253
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,500
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

254
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Dad!

255
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,900
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

256
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,500
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.

257
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,700
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

258
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,900
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

259
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,900
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

260
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,400
- Harold!
- Shrek!

261
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,400
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

262
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,800
- Mom!
- Harold...

263
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Donkey!

264
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

265
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,600
You're all grown up.

266
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

267
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm your fairy godmother.

268
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,800
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

269
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,100
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.

270
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
With just a...

271
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,200
# Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone

272
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,000
# With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash

273
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
# A high-priced dress
made by mice no less

274
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,000
# Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,900
# Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse

276
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,600
# Confide in your very own
furniture friends

277
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
# We'll help you set a new fashion trend

278
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,700
- # I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- # The kind of girl a prince would date!

279
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,000
# They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...

280
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,100
# "For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!"

281
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,000
# A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle

282
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,500
# Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away

283
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,200
# And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!'

284
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,900
# Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair

285
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,300
# Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush

286
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
# Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay

287
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,300
# You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune

288
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,900
# Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
# Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!

290
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,100
# Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair?

291
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,200
Stop!

292
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,900
Look...

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

294
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,500
but I really don't need all this.

295
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,200
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

296
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,300
Fiona? Fiona?

297
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

298
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,700
Oh, uh...

299
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

300
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,100
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

301
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,700
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

302
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,300
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

303
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,300
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

304
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,000
She's just trying to help.

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

306
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,600
- What?
- I don't want to leave.

307
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,300
When did you decide this?

308
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,800
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

309
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,200
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

310
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,500
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me...

311
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
happiness...

312
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,300
is just a teardrop away.

313
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,900
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

314
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,700
Happy, happy, happy...

315
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,900
So I see.

316
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,700
Let's go, Kyle.

317
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,800
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

318
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,600
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

319
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,100
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

320
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,700
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

321
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,500
even if I did want it.

322
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

323
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,900
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

324
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,700
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

325
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

326
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,900
Here's a news flash for you!

327
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,000
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!

328
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,100
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

329
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

330
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,200
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
I knew this would happen.

332
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
You should.
You started it.

333
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

334
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,700
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

335
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,000
This is Fiona's choice.

336
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,100
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

337
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,200
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

338
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

339
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,600
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

340
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,100
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

341
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,900
Don't you remember when
we were young?

342
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,900
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

343
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,000
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,300
It's not the same!

345
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

346
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,700
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

347
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,500
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

348
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!

349
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

350
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,800
Hello, Harold.

351
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

352
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

353
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,500
I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

354
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
You better get in.
We need to talk.

355
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,600
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

356
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,100
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

357
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,000
So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

358
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,700
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

359
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,800
So, what's new?

360
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,500
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

361
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,000
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

362
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,000
When did you get back?

363
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

364
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,500
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

365
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

366
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Mommy can handle this.

367
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,900
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

368
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,800
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

369
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,800
And what does he find?

370
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,600
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

371
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
is already married.

372
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,800
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

373
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,500
Stop the car!

374
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Harold.

375
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,200
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

376
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,000
Where are we?

377
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,100
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Er... okay.

379
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo... chili rings...

380
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,300
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

381
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

382
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,000
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

383
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,700
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

384
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,900
There you are, dear.

385
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,900
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

386
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
Indeed not.

387
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,600
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

388
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,100
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,500
Not only for your daughter...

390
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,700
but for your Kingdom.

391
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
What am I supposed to do about it?

392
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Use your imagination.

393
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,800
Oh...

394
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Come on in, Your Majesty.

395
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,200
# I like my town

396
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,500
# With a little drop of poison

397
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,700
# Nobody knows...

398
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Excuse me.

399
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,100
Do I know you?

400
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,900
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

401
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,600
Uh... excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

402
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,900
Ah! There you are. Right.

403
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,200
You see, I need to have
someone taken care of.

404
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,400
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

405
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
Um... He's an ogre.

406
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,500
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

407
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,800
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

408
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,800
he don't like to be disturbed.

409
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,500
Where could I find him?

410
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Hello?

411
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,700
Who dares enter my room?

412
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,300
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to

413
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,000
about an ogre problem?

414
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,200
You are told correct.

415
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,000
But for this, I charge
a great deal of money.

416
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,000
Would... this be enough?

417
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,700
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

418
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,900
Just tell me where
I can find this ogre.

419
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,700
# Everyone says
I'm getting down too low

420
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,300
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go

421
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,800
# You just gotta let it go

422
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,100
# I need some sleep

423
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,500
# Time to put the old horse down

424
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,200
# I'm in too deep

425
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,500
# And the wheels keep spinning round

426
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,300
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go?

427
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,500
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go?

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,900
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

429
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,400
Dear Diary...

430
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,100
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

431
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,900
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

432
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,400
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

433
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,600
Must be like some finishing school.

434
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,400
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

435
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,100
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

436
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,600
and bring me back to my family,

437
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,800
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

438
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,500
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

439
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,700
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

440
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

441
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,400
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

442
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,500
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

443
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,000
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

444
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

445
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,300
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.

446
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,700
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

447
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

448
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,800
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

449
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,100
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

450
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,600
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

451
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
A little father-son time?

452
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,600
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

453
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

454
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.

455
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,000
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

456
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,300
"Head to the
darkest part of the woods..."

457
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
"Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches."

458
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,600
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

459
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,300
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

460
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,700
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

461
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
and I end up lost
in the woods with you!

462
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.

463
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,800
I know! I know.

464
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,400
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

465
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,500
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

466
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,300
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

467
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,200
Well, well, well, Donkey.

468
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,800
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

469
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
What? I ain't purring.

470
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,800
Sure. What's next? A hug?

471
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,900
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...

472
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,400
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!

473
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,700
Look! A little cat.

474
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,000
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

475
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,800
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

476
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

477
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,600
Whoa!

478
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,800
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

479
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh, God. Oh...

480
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
No!

481
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,900
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

482
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
Shrek! Hold still!

483
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,900
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.

484
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,900
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

485
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,200
Puss... in Boots!

486
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,700
I'll kill that cat!

487
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,000
Ah-ha-ha!

488
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,800
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

489
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,600
What should we do with him?

490
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,900
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

491
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,200
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!

492
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,000
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Senor.

493
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
I was doing it only for my family.

494
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,600
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

495
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,000
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

496
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

497
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,200
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

498
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,100
The rich King? Sí.

499
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

500
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,000
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

501
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Gee, thanks.

502
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,800
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

503
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,100
That's what the King said.

504
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,700
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question
was directed at me.

505
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

506
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,700
Well, it's not like
I wouldn't change if I could.

507
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I just... I just wish
I could make her happy.

508
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,100
Hold the phone...

509
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,700
"Happiness."

510
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,600
"A tear drop away."

511
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,400
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

512
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,900
Aw, man, where do I begin?

513
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,200
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

514
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,900
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

515
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going "Pinata!"

516
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,200
What is a pinata, anyway?

517
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,600
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

518
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't go projecting on me.

519
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,200
I know you're feeling bad,
but you got to...

520
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,400
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

521
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,300
What? Is it on? Is it on?

522
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,200
This is Fairy Godmother.

523
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

524
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,000
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

525
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,700
Have a "happy ever after."

526
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
Oh...

527
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,000
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

528
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,500
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

529
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,000
# Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!

530
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,500
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

531
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,200
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life

532
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,100
as you have spared me mine.

533
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,400
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

534
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,300
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

535
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,000
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

536
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,700
in his wee little boots.

537
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,100
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

538
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,800
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

539
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,500
Ahh!

540
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,400
Listen. He's purring!

541
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,500
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

542
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,000
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

543
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,600
Shrek!

544
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Shrek?

545
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,000
They're both festive, aren't they?

546
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,900
What do you think, Harold?

547
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,100
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.

548
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,600
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

549
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,900
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.

550
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,200
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

551
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,100
Mom. Dad.

552
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,800
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

553
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,400
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

554
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,100
I haven't.
You should ask your father.

555
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,700
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

556
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,000
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

557
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,500
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

558
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,600
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

559
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,300
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

560
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,300
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

561
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,100
I'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

562
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,300
You know, after your
little spat last night.

563
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,500
Oh. You heard that, huh?

564
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,200
The whole kingdom heard you.

565
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,000
I mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

566
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,500
well, a bit of a brute.

567
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,800
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

568
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,100
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

569
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Shrek loves me for who I am.

570
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,200
I would think you'd be happy for me.

571
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

572
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,800
Maybe you should do the same.

573
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,300
No, really?

574
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,100
Shh...

575
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,400
Oh...

576
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,100
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

577
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,000
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

578
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,400
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

579
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,900
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

580
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
He makes me laugh.

581
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,000
Hi. I'm here to see the...

582
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

583
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,800
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

584
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,200
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

585
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,900
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

586
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,000
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

587
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
The union?

588
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,500
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

589
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,100
Oh! Oh, right.

590
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,100
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

591
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,800
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.

592
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,400
They don't even have dental.

593
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,800
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

594
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,900
Oh. By the way.

595
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,200
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

596
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,300
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

597
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,500
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

598
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,300
A drop of desire.

599
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,100
Naughty!

600
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
A pinch of passion.

601
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,100
And just a hint of...

602
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,800
lust!

603
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,100
Excuse me.

604
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,800
Sorry to barge in like this...

605
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,900
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

606
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,900
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

607
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,100
Oh-ho-ho!

608
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,700
And there's some question
as to why that is?

609
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,600
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

610
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,000
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.

611
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,200
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...

612
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,200
No ogres!

613
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,600
Let's see. Snow White.

614
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,400
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

615
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,600
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

616
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,700
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

617
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,700
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

618
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,300
No, no, no, no, no!

619
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,700
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

620
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
All right, look, lady!

621
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,800
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

622
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,800
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

623
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,300
Oh! Sorry.

624
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Ah... that's okay.

625
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,800
We were just leaving.

626
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,400
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

627
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
Just... go.

628
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,500
Come on, guys.

629
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,600
TGIF, eh, buddy?

630
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

631
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,300
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

632
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Man, that stinks!

633
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,400
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

634
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,700
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!

635
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Already our minds are becoming one.

636
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,500
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

637
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

638
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,200
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

639
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,500
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

640
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives,

641
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,400
I was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

642
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,700
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

643
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,100
Shrek, are you off your nut?

644
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,600
Donkey, keep watch.

645
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,700
Keep watch?
Yeah, I'll keep watch.

646
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

647
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,500
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.

648
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,200
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

649
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,300
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems.

650
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,100
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.

651
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,600
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."

652
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,900
Sorry. No handsome.

653
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

654
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,100
Well, what does it do?

655
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,400
It says "Beauty Divine."

656
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,800
In some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

657
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,200
Especially us talking ones.

658
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,400
Donkey!

659
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,800
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

660
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,200
Can we get on with this?

661
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,900
Hurry!

662
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,500
Nice catch, Donkey!

663
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,600
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

664
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,700
Come on!

665
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,100
# You spurn my natural emotions

666
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,800
# You make me feel like dirt
and I'm hurt

667
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,400
# And if I start a commotion

668
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,000
# I run the risk of losing you
and that's worse

669
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,100
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

670
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,500
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

671
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,800
# In love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

672
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

673
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,100
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

674
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,500
# With someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

675
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,600
# Fallen in love with

676
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,400
# Ever fallen in love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with?

677
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,600
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

678
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,300
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

679
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,600
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

680
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,000
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

681
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,000
Whoa, what happened here?

682
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,100
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

683
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,600
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

684
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,000
I will smite him where he stands!

685
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

686
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,400
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

687
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,900
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

688
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,900
Pardon. Um...

689
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,100
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

690
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
What?

691
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh...

692
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,000
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

693
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,300
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

694
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,800
"For you and your true love.

695
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,500
"If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

696
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,300
"Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine."

697
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,000
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

698
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,500
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

699
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,400
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

700
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,800
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

701
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,600
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

702
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,000
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

703
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,900
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

704
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,800
allow me to take the first sip.

705
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,300
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

706
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,300
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

707
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,900
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.

708
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,900
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

709
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,700
How do you feel?

710
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,900
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

711
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,900
You still look like an ass to me.

712
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,900
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

713
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,700
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

714
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,300
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.

715
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,100
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.

716
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,800
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!

717
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,200
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!

718
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,000
But I love Fiona more.

719
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,700
Shrek, no! Wait!

720
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,300
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

721
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,000
Maybe it's a dud.

722
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,100
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

723
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,000
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

724
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,300
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!

725
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,600
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

726
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
I'm melting!

727
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,500
It's just the rain, Donkey.

728
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
Oh.

729
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,400
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

730
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,000
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hitman to whack you.

731
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,100
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

732
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,100
# The sun'll come out...

733
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,900
# Tomorrow

734
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,500
# Bet your bottom...?

735
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,400
Bet my bottom?

736
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,700
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

737
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
Donkey?

738
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,300
Are you all right?

739
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,200
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?

740
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,500
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

741
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,100
What is it, darling?

742
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,800
Dad...

743
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,200
I've been thinking
about what you said.

744
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,900
And I'm going to set things right.

745
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,400
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

746
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,100
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

747
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,800
I'm going to go out and find him.

748
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

749
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,600
Fiona, please!

750
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

751
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,500
Fiona!

752
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,600
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

753
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,200
Good morning, sleepyhead.

754
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,800
Good morning!

755
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,300
We love your kitty!

756
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,000
- Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

757
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,600
Thanks.

758
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Uhh!

759
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
Aahh!

760
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Oh...

761
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,900
A cute button nose?

762
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,900
Thick, wavy locks?

763
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,700
Taut, round buttocks?

764
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,900
I'm... I'm...

765
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,300
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.

766
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,000
I'm Jill. What's your name?

767
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,100
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

768
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,400
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.

769
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,200
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.

770
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,700
Get in line.

771
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,600
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

772
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,300
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

773
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,300
I can whinny.

774
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,400
I can count.

775
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,600
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!

776
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,300
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

777
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,300
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."

778
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,400
Pah!

779
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,000
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

780
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,500
"Not intended for heart patients
or those with... nervous disorders."

781
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,500
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!

782
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,600
What?

783
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,200
Senor? "To make the effects
of this potion permanent,

784
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,700
"the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight."

785
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,000
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?

786
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,800
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.

787
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,200
I'll be true... enough.

788
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,600
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

789
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,700
Oh...

790
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,200
And take it from me, Boss.

791
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,400
You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

792
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,900
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

793
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,300
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

794
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,200
- Easy.
- ... cantankerous, foul,

795
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,100
angry ogre you always been.

796
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,300
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

797
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,800
Yeah.

798
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,400
Well...

799
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,800
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

800
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,600
First things first.

801
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,100
We need to get you out of those clothes.

802
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,300
- Ready?
- Ready!

803
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Driver, stop!

804
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,100
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

805
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,700
I'm blind! Tell the truth.

806
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,500
Will I ever play the violin again?

807
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,200
You poor creature!

808
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,400
Is there anything
I can do for you?

809
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,600
Well, I guess there is one thing.

810
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,600
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

811
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,700
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

812
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,500
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?

813
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,400
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.

814
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,800
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

815
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,300
# Oh, yeah

816
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,900
# Turn and face the strange

817
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,000
# Ch-Ch-Changes

818
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,800
# Don't wanna be a richer one

819
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,500
# Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

820
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,100
# Turn and face the strange

821
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,000
# Ch-Ch-Changes

822
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
# Just gonna have to be
a different man

823
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,400
# Time may change me

824
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,600
# But I can't trace time

825
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Halt!

826
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,100
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

827
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,700
# Still don't know what
I was looking for

828
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:59,200
# And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets

829
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,100
# Every time I thought
I'd got it made

830
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,700
# It seemed the taste
was not so sweet

831
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,700
# Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

832
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,200
# Turn and face the strange

833
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,800
- Shrek?
- # Ch-Ch-Changes

834
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,500
# Don't wanna be a richer one

835
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,300
# Time may change me

836
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,900
# But I can't trace time

837
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,900
Fiona?

838
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,900
Hello, handsome.

839
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,900
Shrek!

840
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,300
- Princess!
- Donkey?

841
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,400
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

842
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,700
What potion?

843
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,900
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

844
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,000
Now, we're sexy!

845
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,200
Shrek?

846
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,800
For you, baby... I could be.

847
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,100
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

848
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,500
He went inside looking for you.

849
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,100
Shrek?

850
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,600
Fiona! Fiona!

851
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,600
You want to dance, pretty boy?

852
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,900
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

853
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,000
Fiona?

854
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,500
Shrek?

855
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,400
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

856
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,000
What happened to your voice?

857
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,200
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

858
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,700
But not the way I feel about you.

859
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,200
Fiona?

860
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,800
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

861
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,600
Dad. I was so hoping
you'd approve.

862
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,100
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

863
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,500
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

864
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,900
but, well, what do you think?

865
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,500
Fiona! Fiona!

866
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,700
Fiona!

867
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,700
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

868
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,100
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

869
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,900
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

870
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,700
I just wanted her to be happy.

871
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,000
And now she can be.

872
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,900
Oh, sweetheart.

873
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,800
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

874
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,800
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.

875
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,000
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

876
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,100
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

877
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,000
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

878
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
But...

879
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,300
I love her.

880
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,200
If you really love her...

881
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,200
you'll let her go.

882
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Shrek?

883
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,000
Senor.

884
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,100
What's going on?
Where are you going?

885
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,300
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

886
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,700
# People just ain't no good

887
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,200
# I think that's well understood

888
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,700
There you go, boys.

889
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,600
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

890
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,100
Hey. Why the long face?

891
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,400
It was all just a stupid mistake.

892
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,100
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

893
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,900
I hate Mondays.

894
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,700
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

895
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,100
What choice do I have?

896
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,600
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

897
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

898
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,100
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

899
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,300
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

900
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,900
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

901
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,100
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

902
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,700
Look, guys.
It's for the best.

903
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,000
Mom and Dad approve,

904
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,400
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

905
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,100
Everybody wins.

906
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,300
Except for you.

907
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,700
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

908
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,000
Aye.

909
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,400
And that's why
I have to let her go.

910
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,100
Excuse me, is she here?

911
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,300
She's, uh... in the back.

912
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,100
Oh, hello again.

913
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,300
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

914
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,600
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

915
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:51,300
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

916
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,700
- FYl, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

917
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,500
I mean,
how charming can I be

918
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,800
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

919
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,900
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

920
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,200
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

921
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,500
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

922
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,600
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!

923
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,000
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

924
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,800
which will be Charming.

925
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,800
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

926
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,100
I can't. I won't do it.

927
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,600
Oh, yes, you will.

928
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,300
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

929
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,700
And I can take it away
just as easily.

930
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,900
Is that what you want? Is it?

931
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,200
- No.
- Good boy.

932
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,900
Now, we have to go.

933
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,200
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

934
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,400
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

935
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

936
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,800
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

937
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,600
Mother?

938
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,900
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

939
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,700
The ogre!

940
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,500
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

941
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

942
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,300
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

943
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,300
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

944
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,100
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

945
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,000
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

946
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,500
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

947
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,500
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

948
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,800
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

949
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,400
What the heck are the crumbs for?

950
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,400
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

951
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,100
Oh, aren't they adorable!

952
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,200
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

953
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,100
Tired old thing.

954
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,500
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

955
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,600
Oh. It's the one, it's the only...

956
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,200
It's the Fairy Godmother!

957
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,400
Hello, Far, Far Away!

958
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,600
Can I get a whoop whoop?

959
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,200
May all your endings be happy and...

960
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:59,200
Well, you know the rest!

961
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,100
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

962
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,000
after these messages.

963
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,600
I hate these ball shows.

964
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,800
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

965
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,400
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

966
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,900
Whizzes on you guys.

967
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,000
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

968
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,200
No, to your left. Your left!

969
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,200
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!

970
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,600
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

971
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,600
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

972
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,300
their "devil may mare" attitudes
just won't fly.

973
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,300
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

974
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

975
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!

976
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,900
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

977
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,800
You capitalist pig dogs!

978
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,700
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

979
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,800
Find Princess Fiona!

980
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,400
I'm a donkey!

981
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,100
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!

982
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,600
Quick! Rewind it!

983
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,000
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!

984
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,600
Darling?

985
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,500
Ah. I thought I might
find you here.

986
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,100
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

987
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,400
I'm not going.

988
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,500
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

989
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,500
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

990
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,100
I mean, look at him.

991
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,700
Yes, he is a bit different,

992
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,800
but people change
for the ones they love.

993
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,000
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

994
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,700
Change?

995
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,900
He's completely lost his mind!

996
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,400
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

997
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,200
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

998
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,400
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

999
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,400
I'd give anything to have him back.

1000
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

1001
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,300
Otherwise I'm up all night.

1002
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,500
Thanks.

1003
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,400
I got to get out of here!

1004
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,000
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

1005
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,400
What about my Miranda rights?

1006
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,200
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.

1007
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,400
Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!

1008
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,900
You have the right to remain silent.

1009
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,500
What you lack is the capacity.

1010
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,000
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

1011
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,300
Shrek? Donkey?

1012
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,500
Too late.

1013
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,900
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

1014
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh...

1015
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,900
Fire in ze hole!

1016
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,100
Look out below!

1017
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,500
Quick! Tell a lie!

1018
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,200
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

1019
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,200
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"

1020
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,300
I am wearing ladies' underwear.

1021
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,500
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!

1022
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,600
It looks like you
most certainly am are!

1023
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,200
- I am not!
- What kind?

1024
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,700
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!

1025
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,100
- Are not.
- Are too!

1026
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,800
- Are not!
- Are too!

1027
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,600
Here we go. Hang tight.

1028
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,900
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!

1029
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,400
Ow!

1030
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,900
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1031
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,000
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

1032
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,900
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

1033
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,700
We've got to stop that kiss!

1034
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,600
I thought you was going
to let her go.

1035
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,800
I was, but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

1036
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,000
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

1037
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,800
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.

1038
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,800
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

1039
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,600
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

1040
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,300
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1041
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,700
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

1042
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,100
Because we're gonna need flour.

1043
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,200
Lots and lots of flour.

1044
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,700
Gingy!

1045
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,100
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

1046
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,700
It's alive!

1047
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,300
Run, run, run,
as fast you can!

1048
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,200
Go, baby, go!

1049
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,600
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

1050
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,900
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

1051
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,900
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

1052
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,700
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

1053
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,200
Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!

1054
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,800
Pretty pony.

1055
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,300
Ladies and gentlemen.

1056
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:05,100
Presenting Princess Fiona
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1057
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,300
Shrek, what are you doing?

1058
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,500
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1059
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,400
Is that glitter on your lips?

1060
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,300
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

1061
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,000
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

1062
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,000
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

1063
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

1064
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,800
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

1065
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,100
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

1066
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,800
Fiona, my Princess.

1067
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,300
Will you honor me with a dance?

1068
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,300
# Where have all the good men gone

1069
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,100
# And where are all the gods?

1070
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,100
Dance!

1071
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,900
# Where's the streetwise Hercules

1072
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,400
# To fight the rising odds?

1073
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,900
Since when do you dance?

1074
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,700
Fiona, my dearest,
if there's one thing I know,

1075
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,900
it's that love is full of surprises.

1076
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,400
# Late at night I toss and I turn

1077
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,900
# And I dream of what I need

1078
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,800
Hit it!

1079
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,100
# I need a hero

1080
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,200
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

1081
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,200
Man the catapults!

1082
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,900
Aim! Fire!

1083
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,900
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

1084
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,100
Not the gumdrop button!

1085
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,900
Incoming!

1086
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,500
Ha-ha! All right!

1087
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:06,000
# Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

1088
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,500
Go, Mongo! Go!

1089
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,200
Man the cauldrons!

1090
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,700
After you, Mongo.

1091
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,500
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

1092
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,300
Shrek!

1093
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,800
More heat, less foam!

1094
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,600
# Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

1095
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,500
# Out where the lightning
Splits the sea

1096
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:46,300
# I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

1097
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,900
Heave! Ho!

1098
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,100
No...!

1099
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,800
Come on!

1100
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,100
Look out!

1101
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,900
Be good.

1102
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,400
He needs me!
Let me go!

1103
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,300
Donkey!

1104
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,600
Puss!

1105
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,900
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

1106
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,900
Today, I repay my debt.

1107
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,000
On guard!

1108
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,100
# He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

1109
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,600
# And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight

1110
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,400
- # I need a hero?
- Stop!

1111
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,200
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

1112
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,500
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

1113
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,600
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

1114
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,700
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

1115
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,500
I see London! I see France!

1116
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,900
Whah!

1117
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,400
I'm a real boy!

1118
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,100
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!

1119
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,700
Catch!

1120
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,100
Donkey!

1121
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,500
Oh!

1122
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,500
I'm a real boy. Aah!

1123
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,100
Oh!

1124
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,100
- Ha!
- Ah.

1125
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,000
That's mine!

1126
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,400
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

1127
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,100
And Donkey!

1128
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,100
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

1129
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,100
No!

1130
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,100
Hi-ya!

1131
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,300
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

1132
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,300
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

1133
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,000
Well, I guess I gave her
the wrong tea.

1134
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,400
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1135
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,600
I told you.

1136
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,800
Ogres don't live happily ever after.

1137
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,900
Woo!

1138
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,700
Ha!

1139
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
Oh, Dad!

1140
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,900
- Is he...?
- Yup.

1141
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,800
He croaked.

1142
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,200
Harold?

1143
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,100
Dad?

1144
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,300
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

1145
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,600
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

1146
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,800
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry.

1147
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,700
To both of you.

1148
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,600
I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

1149
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,800
But I can see now...

1150
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,400
she already has it.

1151
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,500
Shrek, Fiona...

1152
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:13,400
Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

1153
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,000
and my blessing?

1154
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,300
Harold?
I'm sorry, Lillian.

1155
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,800
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

1156
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,100
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

1157
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,900
warts and all.

1158
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,000
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

1159
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,100
Midnight!

1160
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,700
Fiona. Is this what you want?

1161
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,700
To be this way forever?

1162
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,400
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

1163
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,900
we can stay like this.

1164
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,800
You'd do that?

1165
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,800
- For me?
- Yes.

1166
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,000
I want what any princess wants.

1167
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,700
To live happily ever after...

1168
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,200
with the ogre I married.

1169
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,900
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!

1170
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,000
You cannot make me cry!

1171
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,500
Whoa!

1172
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,400
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.

1173
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,000
Oh, no.

1174
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:12,300
Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

1175
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,800
Now, where were we?

1176
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,000
Oh. I remember.

1177
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,700
Hey! Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

1178
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,400
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

1179
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,600
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

1180
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,400
# She's into superstitions

1181
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,000
# Black cats and voodoo dolls

1182
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,600
- Sing it, Puss!
- # I feel a premonition

1183
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,100
# That girl's gonna make me fall

1184
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,500
Here we go!

1185
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,300
# She's into new sensations

1186
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,800
# New kicks in the candlelight

1187
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,400
# She's got a new addiction

1188
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,800
# For every day and night

1189
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,000
# She'll make you take your clothes off

1190
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,200
# And go dancing in the rain

1191
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,100
# She'll make you live her crazy life

1192
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,700
# But she'll take away your pain

1193
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,000
# Like a bullet to your brain

1194
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,500
# Upside inside out

1195
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,800

Are you serious?
