1
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,295
Oh, fuck.

2
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:54,496
- Uh, yeah?
- Miles, can you move your car, please?

3
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,499
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

4
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,002
- You didn't park too good. Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

5
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,087
Hold on.

6
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,776
Sorry. Sorry, gentlemen.

7
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,987
Sorry.

8
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,104
Oh, fuck me!

9
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,358
I know I said
I would be there by noon...

10
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:08,278
but, uh, there's all of this work
going on at my building...

11
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:10,781
and it's just a total nightmare.

12
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:14,284
I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning...

13
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,286
but I'm on my way.

14
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,872
I'm out the door right now.

15
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,182
- Hi, Simon.
- Hey, Miles.

16
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,184
- Triple espresso, please?
- For here?

17
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,187
Uh, no, actually.
I'm running late. Make it to go.

18
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,190
And give me a New York Times
and a spinach croissant.

19
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,859
Thank you.

20
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,969
- Ah!
- Well, hello!

21
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:58,305
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?
- Come on in.

22
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:01,308
- Thank you. Is Jack still here?
- Yes.

23
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,190
Shot on the way to the 118.

24
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,694
Look what the cat dragged.

25
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,697
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.
- Hey.

26
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,699
Somebody finally arrived.

27
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,701
You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.

28
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,704
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?
- Hi. How are you?

29
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,208
We were thinking maybe you went
the wrong way,you went to Tijuana...

30
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,210
- Right.
- and they don't let you back.

31
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,212
- Yes! Yes!
- Daddy!

32
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,215
- I had to bribe them.
- Hey, Miles.

33
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,217
Hey. How are you, Christine?

34
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,219
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.

35
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,222
Unbelievable.
It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.

36
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,225
People getting an early start
on the weekend, I guess.

37
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,227
Granted, I got a late start, but--

38
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,729
Well, we're just glad you made it.

39
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,232
Christine, why don't you
ask Miles about the cake?

40
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,234
- Oh, good idea. Come with me.
- What's this?

41
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,237
We don't really have time for that,
'cause we gotta hit the road.

42
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,532
- Oh, come on.!
It's just gonna take a second.!
- Yeah.

43
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:01,076
Mmm.

44
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,370
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.

45
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:06,373
- Uh--
- Yes, congratulations.

46
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:10,210
Yes, well, uh,
it's not exactly finalized yet.

47
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:13,755
- So-- There has been some interest, and--
- Your friend is modest.

48
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:17,050
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

49
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:20,387
- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What is the subject of your book?

50
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,723
- Nonfiction?
- Uh, no. It's-- It's a novel.

51
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:25,058
- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.

52
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:28,103
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life...

53
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:31,106
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.

54
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,400
Good. I like nonfiction.

55
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,944
There is so much to know
about this world.

56
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:39,448
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

57
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,910
That's an interesting perspective.

58
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:46,371
- So, which one do you like better?
- Oh, well, I like them both.

59
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,917
But, um, if pressed, I would have to say
that I prefer the dark.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,419
Told ya.!

61
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,713
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

62
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:03,805
- Bye.
- Bye.

63
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,730
Bye.

64
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:14,733
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

65
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:17,945
- We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.

66
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,989
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

67
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,617
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.

68
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:27,454
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

69
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,499
Why did you tell them
that my novel was being published?

70
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:34,211
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

71
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:37,631
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

72
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:41,677
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors
was passing it to a senior editor.

73
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,179
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

74
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:46,181
No. It's a long shot.

75
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,768
Besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.

76
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:51,770
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

77
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:53,772
You know? I've stopped caring.

78
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,775
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.

79
00:06:56,859 --> 00:07:00,028
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.

80
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,531
I think this is the one. Huh?

81
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,533
I'm really proud of you, man.

82
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,660
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?

83
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:10,873
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?

84
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,500
- I've been saving it. Don't--
- All right. I won't open it.

85
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,544
Jack!

86
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:17,713
Half of it gone.

87
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,216
Hey, shut up. Okay?

88
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,219
Here's to a great week.

89
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,305
Come on.

90
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,183
Yes. Absolutely.

91
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,185
Despite your crass behavior...

92
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,479
I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.

93
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:36,481
Yeah. Me too.

94
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:39,484
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

95
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:42,571
- Was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!

96
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,573
That's 1 00% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.

97
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,575
They don't even make it anymore.

98
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,535
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,579
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh,Jesus.

100
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,581
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

101
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:55,918
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
-Just tell me.

102
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,921
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.

103
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,882
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run...

104
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:04,927
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation--

105
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,931
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

106
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,933
- Oh,yeah.yeah.
- And?

107
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,935
It's great.

108
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,938
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

109
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,357
Just seems-- I don't know,
more congealed or something.

110
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,903
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

111
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:27,574
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

112
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,576
There is no new ending.

113
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,579
Page 7 50 on is exactly the same.

114
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:37,167
Well, maybe it just seemed new...

115
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,920
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

116
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,964
Yeah! That must be it!

117
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,719
Whoa. Why are we getting off?

118
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,722
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

119
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,725
- I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

120
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,727
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Okay?

121
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:59,064
- And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
- Okay.

122
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,984
- It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
- Okay.!

123
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,987
I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?

124
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:08,073
Uh, oh... 70-something.

125
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:17,165
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.

126
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,975
Thank you.

127
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:47,905
- Surprise.!
- Surprise!

128
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,907
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

129
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:53,744
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!

130
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:57,247
What a surprise!

131
00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:01,210
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

132
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,212
Happy birthday, Mom.

133
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,214
They're from both of us.

134
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:10,010
- A famous actor
bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!

135
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:13,680
- Don't I feel special?
- And champagne.!

136
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,934
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!

137
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,936
Isn't that nice.

138
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:22,356
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...

139
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,400
marrying no less
than Derek Sommersby.

140
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:29,404
Gosh, that was, like, 1 1 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

141
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:33,534
Well,you were wonderful in that show.!

142
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:38,872
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

143
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:41,416
Oh, now, Miles...

144
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,546
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

145
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,548
Look how I'm dressed!

146
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:50,050
I've gotta run and put my face on.

147
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,052
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

148
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,679
Oh, stop it!

149
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:55,681
Make yourselves comfortable.

150
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:58,684
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

151
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,603
Along with the battle casualties...

152
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,605
Just a snack.

153
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,607
the Germans lost almost a million men.

154
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,111
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.

155
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,285
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

156
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,787
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.

157
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,789
I-Is this chicken?

158
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,791
I could have made something fancier...

159
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,794
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...

160
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,882
was coming for a visit
and bringing a certain special friend.

161
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,633
It was a surprise, Mom.

162
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,136
And I could've already put clean sheets...

163
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,221
on the other bed and the foldout.

164
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,265
You are staying.

165
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:43,228
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up
at 1 1 :30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

166
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:45,522
They do a magnificent job there.

167
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,525
- You talked to Wendy?
-Just now.

168
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,111
She's thrilled! And the twins--

169
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,614
No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.

170
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:57,659
Well, you know,Jack is pretty eager
to, uh, to get up to, um--

171
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,828
You know.

172
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,123
Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.

173
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:08,128
Well, you boys do what you want.

174
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:11,924
I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.

175
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:14,259
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

176
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,096
I'll be right back.

177
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,604
And what was that other one you did?

178
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:51,106
The one where you were the jogger.

179
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,026
Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.

180
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,028
Spray 'n Wash! That's the one!

181
00:13:56,111 --> 00:14:00,199
Gosh. I remember the girl that was
in it with me. She was somethin'.

182
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:03,202
I just remember you jogging.

183
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,704
Whoo-hoo!

184
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:08,207
So, when's the wedding?

185
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,376
Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.

186
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,379
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond.
My main man.

187
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:17,341
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?

188
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,803
I just got divorced, Phyllis.

189
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,972
Two years ago, buddy.

190
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,975
You should get back together...

191
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,311
with Victoria.

192
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,105
She was good for you.

193
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,983
She was good for you!

194
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,486
And so beautiful, and so intelligent.

195
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,488
You knew her, right?

196
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,366
Oh,yeah. Real well. Still do.

197
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,869
I'm worried about you, Miles.

198
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,416
Do you need some money?

199
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:55,837
Jack.

200
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,466
Jack.

201
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,468
Jack, come on.

202
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:10,644
A rubber bag food slinger?

203
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,646
Are you kidding me?

204
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,648
Our super-amazing tree house...

205
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:17,651
brought about by our
two-by-four technology--

206
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:20,904
Jack! No, no, no, no. She'll wake up.

207
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,906
Who did this?

208
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,909
- I did!
- What?

209
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,911
She was tired, silly.

210
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,913
Our ship was so high!

211
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,915
They need a vacation!

212
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,501
Hamster holiday! Fun for all!

213
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,393
Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.
You know what I mean?

214
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,855
Oh. She's a kid, for God's sake.

215
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,858
As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us in the first place.

216
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:01,486
Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks
looking at me all the time. All ages.

217
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,488
Dudes too.

218
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:06,366
Well, it's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.

219
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,745
- It's never free.
- You need to get laid, Miles.

220
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,539
- That's gonna be my best-man gift
to you this week.

221
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,875
I'm gonna get you laid.

222
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,752
Wonderful.

223
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:20,672
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate
or a penknife or any of that other horseshit.

224
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:22,883
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.

225
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:25,677
You have been officially depressed
for, like, two years now.

226
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,680
You're a negative guy anyway,
even back in college.

227
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:30,682
- Mm-hmm.
- And now it's worse.

228
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:34,061
You're wasting away. Teaching English
to fucking eighth-graders?

229
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:37,064
When they oughta be reading what you wrote.
Your books, Miles.

230
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,942
- I'm working on it.
- Not working hard enough.

231
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,445
- Are you still seeing that shrink?
- I saw him on Monday.

232
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,406
I spent most of the time
helping him with his computer.

233
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:51,078
Well, I say fuck therapy and--
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?

234
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,247
And Lexapro, yes.

235
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,708
Well, I say fuck that too.
You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.

236
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,628
Okay,Jack--Jack--

237
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:03,215
This week is not about me.
It is about you.

238
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:07,261
I'm gonna show you a good time.

239
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:10,764
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf...

240
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,767
we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...

241
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,187
and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frere.

242
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:20,107
And get your bone smooched.

243
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:38,417
You know what?

244
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,129
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first. Okay?

245
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:44,673
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

246
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,676
These guys make top-notch pinot
and chardonnay.

247
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,178
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

248
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:53,181
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

249
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:56,935
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.

250
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:00,856
- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

251
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:04,860
You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

252
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:08,322
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

253
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:10,908
and it just cools down the berries.

254
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,827
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

255
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:17,456
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

256
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,461
Let me show you how this is done.

257
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,464
First thing-- hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

258
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,716
You're looking for color and clarity.

259
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,219
-Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

260
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,347
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

261
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,307
- Okay?
- Okay.

262
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,309
Now tip it.

263
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:41,855
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

264
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,900
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

265
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,902
It's usually
more important with reds.

266
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:48,904
- Okay?
- Okay.

267
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,906
Now stick your nose in it.

268
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,408
- Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

269
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,744
Really get your nose right in there.
Really--

270
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:59,414
Mmm. A little citrus.

271
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:02,543
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

272
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,380
Passion fruit. Mmm.

273
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,424
And-- Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...

274
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:13,053
soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--

275
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:16,139
There's a--just a flutter of, like, a--

276
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:19,059
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

277
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,186
Wow.

278
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,188
Mmm!

279
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:25,190
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

280
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,401
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

281
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,445
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

282
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,447
Oxygenating it opens it up.

283
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:35,200
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

284
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:37,619
Smell again.

285
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,622
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of'em.

286
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,208
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.

287
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,921
Mmm! Ahh.

288
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,552
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?

289
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:56,305
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities...

290
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,307
but this one is pretty damn good.

291
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:02,311
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
-Just released two months ago.

292
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:04,313
- Nice job.
- We like it.

293
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:06,648
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

294
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:09,651
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

295
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,488
Are you chewing gum?

296
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,487
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

297
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,489
Whoa!

298
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:58,992
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

299
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,411
I mean, you've been there.

300
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:05,415
Well, you know, I-- I think that you
waited for some good reason...

301
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,418
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

302
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:10,921
so I think it's great.

303
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:12,923
It's time.

304
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:15,926
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

305
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:19,930
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

306
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:22,933
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

307
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:26,937
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

308
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:30,941
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

309
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,943
So I'm thinking about it.

310
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,945
But I don't know.

311
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,947
Might get a little incestuous.

312
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,950
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

313
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,452
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

314
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:45,289
This would just provide some stability.

315
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:49,042
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

316
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:52,045
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

317
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,047
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

318
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:55,757
No. No.

319
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:03,932
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.

320
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,934
- Miles!
- Sir.

321
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,437
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

322
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,440
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

323
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:14,443
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.

324
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:16,904
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

325
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:19,948
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

326
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:22,951
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

327
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:24,953
Absolument.

328
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:27,956
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

329
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,000
Very special. Thank you.

330
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:35,005
Mmm!

331
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,592
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

332
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:44,556
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

333
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,017
Pour us a couple, will ya.

334
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,228
Yeah. It's tight.

335
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,815
There you are, gentlemen.

336
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,902
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

337
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:01,573
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

338
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:03,575
It's gonna be great.

339
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,661
Here's to us.

340
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,086
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,588
Check out that chick.

342
00:23:16,672 --> 00:23:19,299
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

343
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:22,302
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

344
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:25,973
- You know that chick?
- Yes.Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

345
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,308
You know?
It's practically my office.

346
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:31,311
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

347
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:35,315
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year,year and a half.

348
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,317
She's incredibly hot.

349
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:39,653
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

350
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,697
Check out the rock.

351
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,699
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

352
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:45,701
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

353
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:48,495
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

354
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,498
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

355
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:56,503
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

356
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:59,965
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

357
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:02,968
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

358
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,179
Calm down. Let's just eat.

359
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,518
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

360
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:14,521
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

361
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:17,232
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

362
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,944
Uh... no, actually.

363
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,863
But... thank you.

364
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:25,407
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

365
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,409
You guys been out tasting?

366
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,703
Oh, you know it. You know it.

367
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:31,872
Oh, this is my friend,Jack.Jack, Maya.

368
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:33,916
- Hiya.
- Hi.

369
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:36,585
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

370
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,171
Oh. Back to work.

371
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:44,259
-Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

372
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:46,261
And she's obviously into you.

373
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,263
What else do you know about her?

374
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,516
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

375
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,561
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

376
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:57,564
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

377
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:00,108
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton,Jack.

378
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,110
How is that ever gonna work out?

379
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:04,530
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

380
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:08,367
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

381
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,079
You're blind, dude. Blind.

382
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:16,124
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

383
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,256
Hey, Gary.

384
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:24,258
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

385
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:26,260
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

386
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:28,262
Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

387
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:30,264
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

388
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:32,724
Please. Light up, light up.

389
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,313
In fact, would you like to join us?

390
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:42,901
Sure.

391
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:48,740
So, how's that book coming, Miles?

392
00:25:48,824 --> 00:25:51,743
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

393
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:56,164
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

394
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,166
It's getting published.

395
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:01,587
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

396
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,172
Well, congratulations.

397
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,174
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

398
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,260
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

399
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,346
Are you a writer too?

400
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:13,348
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

401
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:15,851
Really. What kind of stuff?

402
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:17,853
Mmm, a lot ofTV.

403
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:21,356
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

404
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:26,028
But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

405
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:28,030
Anything I might know?

406
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,699
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

407
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:35,120
Now with a low, low
5.8% A.P.R. financing!

408
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:37,122
That's hilarious!

409
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:40,125
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

410
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,127
- You are not.
- He is.

411
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:44,379
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

412
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:46,381
Side effects may include oily discharge...

413
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,383
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.

414
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:51,553
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble...

415
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,555
you're dead, asshole!

416
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,557
Yeah.

417
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,809
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

418
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:01,063
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

419
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:06,193
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

420
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:10,239
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

421
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,366
- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

422
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:14,409
Uh, the Windmill.

423
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:16,453
Windmill.

424
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:19,414
The girl is looking to party...

425
00:27:19,498 --> 00:27:22,417
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

426
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,419
-Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired,Jack.

427
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,880
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

428
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:28,882
She lit up like a pinball machine...

429
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:31,385
when she found out
your novel was getting published.

430
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,887
Now I have another lie to live down.

431
00:27:34,012 --> 00:27:36,890
- Thanks,Jack.
-Just trying to get you a little action.

432
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:39,393
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

433
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:42,896
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

434
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,399
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

435
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:48,443
And, by the way, I was right--
she's not married.

436
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:50,571
- How do you know?
- No rock.

437
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:54,324
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

438
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,619
Oh.

439
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:19,266
What's the plan for today, Miles?

440
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,268
Aha.

441
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,937
Good. Um, we head up north--

442
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,939
Begin the grape tour up there...

443
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:27,941
work our way south...

444
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,943
so that the more we drink...

445
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:32,112
the closer we get to the motel.

446
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,452
What's your problem?

447
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:46,168
What is it?

448
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:51,340
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles...

449
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:54,343
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...

450
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:59,097
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.

451
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:01,016
Oh.

452
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:04,144
Well, now the cards are on the table.

453
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,188
Yes, they are.

454
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:09,775
- Ah.
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.

455
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:14,530
I am going to get laid before I get married
on Saturday. Do you read me?

456
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:17,950
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

457
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,952
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.

458
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:22,287
It's, uh,your party, evidently.

459
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,289
Why don't you just, uh--

460
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:28,293
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

461
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:30,295
No, Miles!

462
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,881
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

463
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:34,841
We should both be cutting loose.

464
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:38,804
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

465
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:42,599
It's something we should share.

466
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:18,135
This is our Syrah.

467
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,220
Okay.

468
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:23,599
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

469
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,559
That's a big one.

470
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:38,113
But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

471
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:41,575
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

472
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,245
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

473
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:48,165
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

474
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,793
Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

475
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:18,445
This is our estate chardonnay.

476
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,615
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

477
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,659
Stephanie.

478
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:25,702
Stephanie. Nice.

479
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:29,456
So, what do you think?

480
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,458
Mmm. Quaffable.

481
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,794
But, uh, far from transcendent.

482
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:35,796
I like it. Tastes great.

483
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:37,798
Oak-y.

484
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,758
This is a cabernet franc.

485
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:42,761
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

486
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:45,430
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

487
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,432
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

488
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:50,435
and it was a silver medal winner...

489
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,437
at Paso Robles last year.

490
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,107
Hmm.

491
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,150
Mmm.

492
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,152
Well, I will tell you something.

493
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:02,573
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

494
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:05,576
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--

495
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:08,078
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.

496
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:10,539
So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

497
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:14,209
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

498
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,712
We're just over in Buellton.

499
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:18,714
The Windmill Inn.

500
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,716
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

501
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:23,719
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

502
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,722
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

503
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:29,349
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

504
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,351
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

505
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,353
Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?

506
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,439
Sure.

507
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:39,359
This is our estate Syrah.

508
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:45,407
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

509
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:48,493
I know. I need to be spanked.

510
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:51,747
Excuse me.

511
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:56,084
The Syrah?

512
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:07,888
Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.

513
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,932
- You have the keys.
- I do?

514
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:11,934
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

515
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:13,936
- So, we're on.
- What?

516
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:18,065
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.

517
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,067
- Wi-- With Maya?
- Yeah.

518
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:22,569
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.

519
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:24,571
This chick Stephanie?

520
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:27,574
She's got it all goin' on.

521
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:29,576
Well, she is cute, yeah.

522
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:31,578
Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.

523
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:35,541
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?
What's the matter with you?

524
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:49,429
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

525
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:52,641
Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

526
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:55,811
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

527
00:33:55,894 --> 00:33:58,230
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

528
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:01,775
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

529
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,613
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

530
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:10,576
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

531
00:34:11,994 --> 00:34:15,372
Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.

532
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,624
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

533
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:21,128
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

534
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:23,797
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

535
00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:26,800
She got remarried.

536
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:28,844
She what?

537
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:32,472
When?

538
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:35,100
About a month ago.

539
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:37,102
Maybe six weeks.

540
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:40,981
To that guy--
that guy with the restaurant?

541
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:51,325
Miles?

542
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:53,368
Miles.

543
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:57,748
I'd like to go home now.

544
00:34:57,873 --> 00:34:59,750
Miles, get out of the car.

545
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,294
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

546
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:04,296
You know--

547
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:06,798
She bringing him to the wedding?

548
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,884
What do you think?

549
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:13,013
Why didn't you tell me
about this before,Jack?

550
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:16,892
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

551
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:19,895
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

552
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,315
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party, man.

553
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:25,317
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.

554
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,319
Persona non grata.

555
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:31,907
Everybody's gonna be holding their breath,
waiting to see if I get drunk and make a scene.

556
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:34,701
No, no. No. Look.

557
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:36,203
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

558
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,079
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

559
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,081
She's cool. Everybody's cool.

560
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,667
I'm sorry. You've been talking--

561
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,670
Behind my back...

562
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,755
you've been talking about it?

563
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:50,342
What are you doing?

564
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,594
Come back here.

565
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,680
Miles!

566
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:59,726
- Come here. Give me that bottle.
- Back off,Jack.

567
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,728
- Come on--
- Back off, man!

568
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,898
- Give me that bottle.
- No.

569
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,694
Miles.

570
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:11,864
Miles!

571
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:21,892
A lot of people
out there think they can make it.

572
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:25,896
What better thing in life is to chase the
dream and not be afraid of going after it?

573
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:30,400
James Lepp next to play.
Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.

574
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:35,322
I'm gonna go for a swim,
get the blood flowing. You wanna come?

575
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:37,950
No. I wanna watch this.

576
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:40,494
Okay.

577
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:45,040
Should start this ball one or two inches
outside the left edge.

578
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,294
Go in.

579
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:54,800
- Great putt.
- Absolutely. Great speed.

580
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:01,014
Miles.

581
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:04,184
Miles.

582
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:07,354
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.

583
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,194
This fuckin' chick in theJacuzzi--

584
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:16,196
Oh, dude!

585
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:20,200
This place is wide open.
I'm goin' fuckin' nuts up here, man.

586
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,870
- Hey, what should I wear?
- I don't know.

587
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:25,914
Something casual, but nice.
They think you're a writer.

588
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,083
Right. Okay.

589
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,210
Mmm.

590
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:34,715
Do you have any other shoes?

591
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,675
Uh-uh.

592
00:38:36,758 --> 00:38:38,760
Hmm.

593
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,644
Hey, honey.

594
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:50,189
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.

595
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:53,192
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

596
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:56,403
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

597
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:59,323
Yeah. I miss you too.

598
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:02,409
Yeah. I love you too.

599
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,288
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

600
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:09,291
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

601
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,293
People love that guy.

602
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:14,296
And don't forget--
your novel is coming out in the fall.

603
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:17,299
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

604
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,384
Come here, Miles. Come here.

605
00:39:23,972 --> 00:39:25,891
Do not sabotage me.

606
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:28,894
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

607
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:31,897
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

608
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,900
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

609
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:38,403
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

610
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:40,906
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

611
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:42,908
Jesus. No merlot.

612
00:39:42,991 --> 00:39:45,118
Did you bring your Xanax?

613
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:48,705
All right.

614
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,707
Come here.

615
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:53,377
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

616
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:56,380
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

617
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:59,299
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

618
00:40:03,387 --> 00:40:06,306
Hi.Just looking for some friends.

619
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,778
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

620
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:21,780
- Hi, Miles.
- Good. How are you?

621
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:25,284
Hello, Maya.

622
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:28,287
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- Thank you.

623
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,998
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

624
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,000
So, what's good here?

625
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:36,336
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

626
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,381
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

627
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:42,384
- What time did you close up at Ka-- Is it--
- Kalyra.

628
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:46,555
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.

629
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,558
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were--

630
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:52,060
- That's nice.
- It's aged 1 2 months in oak.

631
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:54,062
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

632
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,064
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

633
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,359
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

634
00:40:59,443 --> 00:41:02,571
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

635
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:06,867
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

636
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:08,994
- Right.
-Just... small stuff.

637
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:10,996
Uh, hints of clove.

638
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,998
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

639
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:15,334
Yeah. Mmm.

640
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,336
Sorry. It's good.

641
00:41:17,419 --> 00:41:19,713
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

642
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:21,715
Good. Okay.

643
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:23,717
Oh, that's-- that--

644
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,553
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

645
00:41:26,637 --> 00:41:28,555
I didn't hear him say that.

646
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,060
- Whenever I say something he said--
- Very good.

647
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:35,562
No, actually-- No. That one.
N-Not this one--

648
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,943
I'm having that too.

649
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,237
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

650
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:44,947
That's what I'm saying.

651
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:46,949
For our soup we have corn chowder...

652
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:50,452
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

653
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:53,622
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

654
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,624
And finally--

655
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:58,627
- I have to explain my credentials.
- Yes.!

656
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:01,088
Miles, what does this remind you of?.

657
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:04,091
"Red wine. Red wine."

658
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:07,469
He was brought up on a lot of charges.

659
00:42:09,054 --> 00:42:11,431
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

660
00:42:11,557 --> 00:42:13,433
Right.

661
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,436
After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

662
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:18,438
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

663
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:20,148
Wow, Miles.!

664
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:22,401
- Ohh.!
- Well, in that case--

665
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:35,873
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

666
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,129
Ancient way of treating the grape.

667
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:45,299
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

668
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:49,678
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

669
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:52,431
So everyone's going back to that.

670
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:05,819
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

671
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:08,822
- It's not a-- It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:10,824
Your lips look soft.

673
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:15,829
- The whole area is--
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

674
00:43:15,954 --> 00:43:18,916
What do they call the--

675
00:43:23,587 --> 00:43:26,507
Malibu-- It's Malibu Canyon.

676
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:32,638
I don't know what the hell
I'm trying to say.

677
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:07,089
Hello?

678
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:09,174
Victoria?

679
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:12,886
Miles?

680
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:16,473
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?

681
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,602
What-- Uh-- What's on your mind?

682
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:22,604
Oh, nothin'. I--

683
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,898
Just heard that you got remarried.

684
00:44:25,023 --> 00:44:27,234
Congratulations. I, uh--

685
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:30,237
Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.

686
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,239
Oh, Miles, you're drunk.

687
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:35,242
Oh,just a little local pinot,
you know.

688
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:39,246
A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.

689
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,749
- Where are you?
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.

690
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,752
New owners. Cozy ambience, uh--

691
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:49,047
Excellent food too.
You should, uh-- You should try it.

692
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:53,427
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.

693
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:57,222
Hello?

694
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:59,474
- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's--

695
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,436
All right, I just--
I wanted to let you know...

696
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:06,440
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

697
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:12,070
so just in case you were dreading some sort of,
you know, run-in or something like that...

698
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:14,114
well, you worry no more...

699
00:45:14,198 --> 00:45:16,116
because I'm not gonna be there.

700
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,745
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

701
00:45:19,828 --> 00:45:22,122
What is his name?

702
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:25,292
Ken.

703
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,294
Ken! Right.

704
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,296
Ken.

705
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:31,298
I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.

706
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:34,718
No-- You know, it's just--
I-I-I heard about this...

707
00:45:34,843 --> 00:45:37,471
for the first time, uh, today.

708
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:39,473
Uh, your getting remarried, that is.

709
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:43,977
And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.

710
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:47,147
Just... hard to believe.

711
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:53,195
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...

712
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,197
for us somewhere down the road.

713
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:57,699
And I just, uh--

714
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,701
- Miles.
- Huh?

715
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:02,704
Maybe it is better
if you don't come to the wedding.

716
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:08,377
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.

717
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:10,462
You're the boss.

718
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:23,308
Huh? I don't know.

719
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:26,186
Welcome back.

720
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,188
Take it easy.

721
00:46:30,357 --> 00:46:33,026
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes. I'm fine.

722
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,070
Thank you.

723
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:40,951
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Excuse us.

724
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:42,995
Sure.

725
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:45,414
- Mmm.
- All right.

726
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,916
Yeah. Don't take too long.

727
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:51,420
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, girls.

728
00:46:51,545 --> 00:46:54,089
What the fuck?
What is up with you?

729
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:56,091
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah--

730
00:46:56,216 --> 00:46:59,219
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

731
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:00,929
Where were you?

732
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:03,015
Bathroom.

733
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:06,059
Did you drink and dial?

734
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:07,853
Hmm?

735
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:10,230
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

736
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:12,733
Victoria is gone. Gone.

737
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:15,235
Poof!. In the wind.

738
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:18,405
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.

739
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,407
Maya-- Fuckin' Maya-- She's great!

740
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:23,410
She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.

741
00:47:23,535 --> 00:47:25,871
What is this morose, come-down bullshit?

742
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:28,373
These girls wanna party with us.

743
00:47:28,457 --> 00:47:30,500
Huh?

744
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:33,754
And what was that 1 0-minute lecture
on, what, Vouvrays?

745
00:47:33,837 --> 00:47:36,507
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

746
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:39,927
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

747
00:47:40,052 --> 00:47:42,930
Have you forgotten all the bad times
you had with Victoria...

748
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:45,557
how small she could make you feel?

749
00:47:45,682 --> 00:47:48,602
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?

750
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:50,604
Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.

751
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:52,773
Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?

752
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:55,776
Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.

753
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,237
Reel her in.
Let's ratchet this up a notch.

754
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,032
Here. Drink some agua fria.

755
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:06,620
Hey!

756
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:08,622
- Hey!
- Mmm.

757
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:13,252
Ah. Well, so, uh,
shall we get some dessert?

758
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:17,256
Uh, well, we were thinking, um, uh,
why don't we go back to my place?

759
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:20,092
I've got wine, some insane cheeses,
music, whatever.

760
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:22,094
Yeah!

761
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:27,474
Waiter!

762
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:43,490
Come here.

763
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:45,492
Uh-huh.

764
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:47,828
- One for you, three for me.
- Mmm.

765
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,998
You sure you wanna do this?

766
00:48:57,588 --> 00:48:59,506
- We're here!
- Hey.!

767
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,925
- Hey!
- Where were you guys?

768
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,263
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.

769
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,390
- Hi.
- Hi.

770
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:10,392
- Oh, Miles.
- Yeah?

771
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:13,395
- Maya's in the back,just past the kitchen.
- Okay.

772
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,397
Thanks.

773
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:26,366
Hi.

774
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,493
Hey.

775
00:49:28,577 --> 00:49:31,371
- Oh, has she got anything good?
- Oh,yeah.

776
00:49:31,455 --> 00:49:34,333
Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.

777
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,335
- Hey, Steph!
- Yeah?

778
00:49:36,418 --> 00:49:40,214
- Can we really open anything we want?
- Yeah,yeah. Anything.

779
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:42,633
Uh, except the Richebourg.

780
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:46,178
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel.

781
00:49:46,303 --> 00:49:48,222
I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.

782
00:49:48,305 --> 00:49:51,558
Oh, good Lord. Um, look at that.

783
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:57,856
I think... this guy's more our speed.

784
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,858
Andrew Murray.

785
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:02,361
Well, okay. All right.

786
00:50:04,988 --> 00:50:07,908
So, what gems do you have
in your collection?

787
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:11,119
Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.

788
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:14,122
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.

789
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:17,125
No, I've never really had the wallet for that.

790
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:19,628
I just have to live bottle to bottle.

791
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:22,130
I've got things I'm saving, definitely.

792
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:26,635
I guess the star would be
a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

793
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,638
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,
and it's just sitting there?

794
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,640
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.

795
00:50:31,765 --> 00:50:33,642
- Okay.
- I'm serious! Hurry!

796
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,644
All right. I would, I would.

797
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:38,730
The '61 s are peaking right now, aren't they?
That's what I've read.

798
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:40,774
No, that's right, yeah.

799
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:43,777
It might be too late already.
What are you waiting for?

800
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:47,781
Oh, I don't know.
A special occasion with the right person.

801
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:52,160
- It was supposed to be for
my 1 0th wedding anniversary, but--
- Mmm.

802
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:55,581
You know, the day you open
a '6 1 Cheval Blanc...

803
00:50:55,664 --> 00:50:57,624
that's the special occasion.

804
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:04,089
So, uh, how long
have you been into wine?

805
00:51:04,173 --> 00:51:07,009
I got serious about seven years ago.

806
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:10,470
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- '88 Sassicaia.

807
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:12,848
- Ah.! Well, congratulations.
- Mmm.

808
00:51:12,973 --> 00:51:14,850
- Yeah.
- That's very good.

809
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:17,227
- Well--
- That would do it. Yeah.

810
00:51:17,352 --> 00:51:19,229
Hmm.

811
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:21,315
Mmm.

812
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:25,903
Oh, wow, that's nice.
That's very good.

813
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:28,906
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.

814
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:30,991
How about you?

815
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:35,996
I think they overdid it a little.

816
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,373
Too much alcohol.
It overwhelms the fruit.

817
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,459
Huh.

818
00:51:44,546 --> 00:51:46,465
Yeah. Yeah.

819
00:51:46,548 --> 00:51:48,967
I'd say you're right on the money.

820
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:51,470
Very good. Nice.

821
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:53,514
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

822
00:51:54,932 --> 00:51:57,851
Mmm! Is that Stephanie's kid?

823
00:51:57,935 --> 00:51:59,853
Oh. Yeah. That's Siena.

824
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:02,731
- Oh, she's a sweetie.
- Cute. Cute.

825
00:52:02,856 --> 00:52:04,733
Where is she?

826
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:06,735
- She's at her grandmother's.
- Oh.

827
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,071
Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.

828
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,073
You got kids?

829
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,075
Uh, me? No. No.

830
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,578
No, I'd just fuck 'em up.

831
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:21,250
No, that was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce-- no kids.

832
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,252
Yeah. Same here.

833
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:25,254
Good.

834
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,339
Let's go in there.

835
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:33,512
Now, for a low, low
4.8% A.P.R. financing--

836
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:47,609
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

837
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:50,112
Yeah, I would say that.

838
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:52,698
Yeah.

839
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:55,701
So, what's your novel about?

840
00:52:55,784 --> 00:52:57,703
What's my-- Oh, brother.

841
00:52:57,786 --> 00:53:01,206
Well, it's, uh--
it's difficult to summarize.

842
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,208
Um...

843
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:06,211
it starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...

844
00:53:06,295 --> 00:53:09,590
about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.

845
00:53:09,673 --> 00:53:12,926
- Oh.
- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.

846
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,928
But only-- only loosely.

847
00:53:15,012 --> 00:53:16,930
What's the title?

848
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:18,932
The Day After Yesterday.

849
00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:21,435
Oh. You mean today.

850
00:53:23,478 --> 00:53:27,065
Um... uh, yeah.
I mean, r-right. But it's more--

851
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:30,777
So it's about, like,
death and mortality, or--

852
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:33,447
Uh, yeah--

853
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:35,449
Y-- Not really.

854
00:53:35,574 --> 00:53:38,452
I, uh-- It de-- It jumps around a lot.

855
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:41,413
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

856
00:53:41,496 --> 00:53:44,416
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.

857
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:47,920
And, uh, a lot of other things happen--
parallel narratives.

858
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,922
It's kind of a mess.

859
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:52,925
And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves...

860
00:53:53,008 --> 00:53:54,927
or devolves...

861
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,304
into this sort of
Robbe-Grillet mystery.

862
00:53:57,429 --> 00:53:59,306
You know?

863
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,433
But no real resolution.

864
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:03,852
- Wow.
- It--

865
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,939
Well, I think it's really great
you're getting it published.

866
00:54:07,064 --> 00:54:10,025
Really. I mean, I know how hard it is
just to write it, even.

867
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,027
Yeah.

868
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:15,322
I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday...

869
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:18,325
and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.

870
00:54:18,408 --> 00:54:20,452
- A paper, huh?
- Yeah.

871
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:23,497
I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.

872
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,958
Sorta chipping away on it.

873
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:28,710
- Horticulture? Really?
- Mmm.

874
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:31,839
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.

875
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:35,342
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.

876
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:37,970
Horticulture? Wow.

877
00:54:38,095 --> 00:54:41,056
So, do you want to work
in a winery or something?

878
00:54:42,182 --> 00:54:43,684
Maybe.

879
00:54:44,893 --> 00:54:46,854
Oh.

880
00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:51,066
Hmm.

881
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:53,193
So, when can I read your book?

882
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,449
Well, I-- You know, I-- Well, I do happen
to have a manuscript in my car.

883
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:01,368
Um, it's not proofed or anything...

884
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:03,704
so it's-- it's full of typos.

885
00:55:03,787 --> 00:55:06,373
- If you don't mind typos--
- Oh, no. Who cares?

886
00:55:06,498 --> 00:55:08,375
I'm the queen of typos.

887
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,460
Okay.

888
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:43,243
Mmm.

889
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,329
Ahh.

890
00:55:47,164 --> 00:55:51,084
You know, can I ask you
a personal question, Miles?

891
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:53,086
Sure.

892
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,088
Why are you so into pinot?

893
00:55:55,172 --> 00:55:58,342
I mean, it's like a thing with you.

894
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:02,221
Uh... I don't know. I don't know.

895
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:06,558
Um... it's a hard grape to grow.

896
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:08,810
As you know. Right?

897
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:11,230
It's, uh-- It's thin-skinned...

898
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:14,066
temperamental, ripens early.

899
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:17,110
It's-- You know, it's not a survivor...

900
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:19,112
like cabernet...

901
00:56:19,238 --> 00:56:21,114
which can just grow anywhere...

902
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,117
and thrive even when it's neglected.

903
00:56:24,243 --> 00:56:27,955
No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?

904
00:56:28,038 --> 00:56:30,457
And, in fact, it can only grow...

905
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:34,461
in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.

906
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,507
And-- And only...

907
00:56:38,632 --> 00:56:43,512
the most patient
and nurturing of growers...

908
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:46,139
can do it, really.

909
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:49,268
Only somebody
who really takes the time...

910
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:53,188
to understand pinot's potential...

911
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:56,191
can then coax it
into its fullest expression.

912
00:56:56,316 --> 00:56:59,653
And then? I mean--

913
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:02,865
Oh, its flavors, they're just
the most haunting and brilliant...

914
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,535
and thrilling and subtle and...

915
00:57:07,786 --> 00:57:10,581
ancient on the planet.

916
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:18,505
No, I mean, you know, cabernets
can be powerful and exalting too...

917
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:22,176
but they seem prosaic to me,
for some reason, by comparison.

918
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:24,636
I don't know. I don't know.

919
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,638
What about you?

920
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:28,640
What about me?

921
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:32,060
I don't know.
Why are you into wine?

922
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:36,565
Oh, I-- I think I--

923
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:40,068
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.

924
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:44,031
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

925
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:46,033
- You know?
- Right.

926
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:49,870
- But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:57:49,995 --> 00:57:51,872
And the more I drank...

928
00:57:51,997 --> 00:57:54,917
the more I liked
what it made me think about.

929
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:56,919
Like what?

930
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:58,921
Like what a fraud he was.

931
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,215
Wow.

932
00:58:01,298 --> 00:58:04,843
No, I mean, I like to think
about the life of wine.

933
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,845
Yeah.

934
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:08,889
How it's a living thing.

935
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:12,559
I like to think about...

936
00:58:12,643 --> 00:58:16,063
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing...

937
00:58:16,146 --> 00:58:18,482
how the sun was shining...

938
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:20,567
if it rained.

939
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:23,654
I like to think about...

940
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:27,115
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...

941
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:31,703
and, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.

942
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:37,417
I like how wine continues to evolve.

943
00:58:37,543 --> 00:58:40,420
Like,
if I opened a bottle of wine today...

944
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:44,550
it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

945
00:58:44,675 --> 00:58:49,096
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

946
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:54,142
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

947
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:58,230
That is, until it peaks...

948
00:58:58,355 --> 00:59:00,274
like your '61 .

949
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:04,820
And then it begins its steady...

950
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:07,823
inevitable decline.

951
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:10,450
Hmm.

952
00:59:11,577 --> 00:59:14,705
And it tastes so fucking good.

953
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:34,474
Yeah.

954
00:59:34,558 --> 00:59:37,102
But you know, I-- I, uh--

955
00:59:37,227 --> 00:59:39,646
I like other wines besides pinot too.

956
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,441
I mean, lately
I've been really into Rieslings.

957
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:45,777
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?

958
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:47,613
Mm-hmm.

959
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:52,075
There's a bathroom in the back?

960
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:54,870
- Yeah. It's through the kitchen.
- I'll be right back.

961
01:00:07,758 --> 01:00:11,011
God, you are such a fuckin' loser.

962
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:14,223
You make me so fuckin' sick.

963
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:17,434
Oh, God. Ah, come on.

964
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:37,496
Hi.

965
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:39,540
- I was just getting some water.
- Okay.

966
01:00:39,665 --> 01:00:41,667
- You want some water?
- No.

967
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:44,336
Okay. It's getting kind of late.

968
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,681
I should really go.

969
01:01:26,962 --> 01:01:29,423
So you know how to get to the Windmill?
Two rights and a left.

970
01:01:29,548 --> 01:01:31,508
- Got it.
- Okay.

971
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:34,094
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.

972
01:01:34,178 --> 01:01:37,055
Good. So did I.

973
01:01:38,307 --> 01:01:42,186
- Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.
- Um--

974
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,148
Did you still want to read my novel?

975
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:48,984
Oh, yeah. Of course.

976
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,782
Yeah.

977
01:01:57,451 --> 01:01:59,828
- Great.
-Just a sec.

978
01:02:03,207 --> 01:02:06,001
- Here.
- Oh, wow.

979
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:08,086
Well, I hope you like it.

980
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:12,925
And feel free to stop reading it any time.
I will not be offended.

981
01:02:13,008 --> 01:02:15,135
Okay.

982
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,888
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.

983
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:06,061
Oh, fuck.

984
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:16,196
Oh, fuck.

985
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:42,347
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.
Unbelievable!

986
01:03:42,431 --> 01:03:44,683
Whoo! Boy.

987
01:03:44,808 --> 01:03:48,187
Ohh, she is nasty, Miles.

988
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,356
Nasty, nasty, nasty.!

989
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:54,610
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
- Yeah, baby.

990
01:03:54,735 --> 01:09:25,851
Congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

991
01:04:01,523 --> 01:04:03,648
Oh, hi, Miles!

992
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,417
Hi.

993
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:09,981
- Hey, you didn't invite Stephanie
to come with us, did you?

994
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,062
Oh, listen, man. Change of plans.

995
01:04:12,163 --> 01:04:16,119
Stephanie's off today, so, you know,
I'm thinkin' about goin' on a hike.

996
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:18,632
We were supposed to play golf.

997
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:22,100
You know what? You go, man.
You go. In fact, use my clubs.

998
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:25,197
- They're brand-new.
They were a gift from Christine's dad.

999
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,774
Here, I'll pay for it. Right there.

1000
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:31,174
And then later, the three of us,
we can go to The Hitching Post.

1001
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,246
We could sit at one of Maya's tables.

1002
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:35,315
She'll bring us some great wine,
you know?

1003
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:38,814
- Then the four of us will do something.
- No. Count me out.

1004
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,217
Oh, I see.

1005
01:04:41,323 --> 01:04:43,983
Didn't go so great last night, huh?
What a shocker.

1006
01:04:44,091 --> 01:04:47,786
You mean getting drunk and calling
Victoria didn't put you in the mood?

1007
01:04:49,162 --> 01:04:51,754
Dumb fuck.

1008
01:04:51,864 --> 01:04:56,321
- Later, man.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should
check your messages first.

1009
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,871
Oh, boy.

1010
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:11,639
Yeah, she's been leaving
messages here too.

1011
01:05:13,184 --> 01:05:15,083
Yeah. Okay.

1012
01:05:15,185 --> 01:05:18,482
- You should call her.
- I will. I'll see you.

1013
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:21,213
- Right now!
- Okay. Fuck!

1014
01:05:21,323 --> 01:05:24,518
- What are you, my mom?
- Well.

1015
01:05:33,134 --> 01:05:35,533
Would you mind waiting outside?

1016
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:44,170
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah. Good food.

1017
01:05:44,276 --> 01:05:48,335
Hey, I-I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.

1018
01:05:48,447 --> 01:05:50,413
You should call her.

1019
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:01,748
- Where's Jack?
- Uh, had to make a phone call.

1020
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:04,347
Oh.

1021
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,694
Miles. Miles.

1022
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:14,897
Hey, man, uh, do you have
that other condom?

1023
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:17,368
In my jacket.

1024
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,403
What did, uh, Christine say?

1025
01:06:19,506 --> 01:06:23,736
Lucked out. Got voice mail.
Everything's cool.

1026
01:06:23,843 --> 01:06:26,639
- Ha, ha.! Here I am.
- Hi.!

1027
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:35,618
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1028
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:26,785
Cannonball!

1029
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:29,989
Please dial your password and press pound.

1030
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:36,068
You have no messages at this time.

1031
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:38,695
To send a message, press 2--

1032
01:08:08,565 --> 01:08:12,055
Uh--

1033
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,227
Not now. Not now!

1034
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:18,466
Yeah.

1035
01:08:29,686 --> 01:08:31,652
Hey, there you are.

1036
01:08:31,753 --> 01:08:34,219
- Yup.
- Hey, man.

1037
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:36,584
What are you drinking?

1038
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:38,657
Is it any good?

1039
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:42,091
Can-- Can I get a glass, please?

1040
01:08:42,195 --> 01:08:45,162
Thanks.

1041
01:08:45,266 --> 01:08:48,461
Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

1042
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:50,533
God, it was so awesome.

1043
01:08:50,636 --> 01:08:53,933
I think I'm really starting to get
a handle on the whole process.

1044
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:56,597
The soil to the vine, and the--
what do you call it?

1045
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:58,901
The selection to the harvest.

1046
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,977
Then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it?

1047
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,377
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1048
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:07,141
Then we ate pinot grapes
right off the vine.

1049
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,307
They were a little sour...

1050
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:12,180
but showing excellent potential
for structure...

1051
01:09:12,288 --> 01:09:14,187
down the line, I think.

1052
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:17,416
Stephanie, man.
She really knows her shit.

1053
01:09:17,524 --> 01:09:19,990
Hmm. Where is Stephanie?

1054
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:23,894
Uh, she's upstairs cleaning up.

1055
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:26,123
What the fuck are you doing?

1056
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:31,428
- What?
- With this chick.

1057
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:33,799
What?

1058
01:09:33,905 --> 01:09:36,133
Does she know about Saturday?

1059
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:38,707
Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

1060
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:40,777
I haven't told her I'm available.

1061
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,346
She knows this trip
is only for a few days.

1062
01:09:43,448 --> 01:09:46,108
Besides, I just--

1063
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:50,448
- Besides what?
- I'm-- Well, you know--

1064
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:52,520
- The wedding.
- What?

1065
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:57,522
I-- I've just been doing
some thinking about it.

1066
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:00,423
Oh, you've been thinking. And?

1067
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:07,222
Might have to put
the wedding on hold, is all.

1068
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:10,791
Look, I know that
that could be tricky...

1069
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:13,928
- for certain people to accept at first.
- Yeah.

1070
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,507
All right?
But life is short, Miles.

1071
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:20,567
I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

1072
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:23,145
You know what?
That's not just for my sake.

1073
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:26,444
I'm looking out
for Christine's feelings too.

1074
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:30,349
I mean, being with Stephanie
has completely opened my eyes.

1075
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:33,252
She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

1076
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,917
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

1077
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,994
- She fucks different.
- Okay.

1078
01:10:39,095 --> 01:10:41,392
She fucks like an animal.

1079
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:44,623
I gotta tell you, man.

1080
01:10:44,734 --> 01:10:47,860
I went deep last night.

1081
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:49,868
Deep.

1082
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:52,700
Deep.

1083
01:10:52,808 --> 01:10:56,264
I thought I'd get a little understanding
from you, but I'm not gonna get that.

1084
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,843
Understanding about what,Jack?

1085
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:04,642
I might be in love with another woman.

1086
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,649
In love? Really?

1087
01:11:06,754 --> 01:11:10,710
Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer
chick, and you're fuckin' in love.

1088
01:11:10,823 --> 01:11:13,790
Come on! And you're gonna
give up everything?

1089
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:17,994
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

1090
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:21,529
You and me, we move up here,
we buy a vineyard.

1091
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:25,087
You design the wine.
I'll handle the business side.

1092
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:28,295
You get inspired, maybe write
another novel, one that can sell.

1093
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:30,304
Oh, my God. No, no.

1094
01:11:30,407 --> 01:11:32,806
As for me, if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s right there, man.

1095
01:11:32,909 --> 01:11:35,375
- It's two hours away. Not even.
-Jesus Christ. You're crazy.

1096
01:11:35,478 --> 01:11:37,910
You've gone crazy.

1097
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:43,848
All I know is that I'm an actor.

1098
01:11:43,952 --> 01:11:46,578
All I have is my instinct.

1099
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:50,977
You're asking me to go against it.

1100
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:54,422
Hi, guys.!

1101
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:57,255
Hi. Hi.

1102
01:11:57,362 --> 01:12:00,329
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

1103
01:12:00,434 --> 01:12:02,559
Where?

1104
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:05,634
I know where all the drivers go.

1105
01:12:05,737 --> 01:12:10,069
Huh? All right. Here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice.

1106
01:12:10,174 --> 01:12:13,073
Nice. Okay, it's the bridge.

1107
01:12:13,176 --> 01:12:17,008
Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.

1108
01:12:19,549 --> 01:12:22,516
You know, it's a thing-- I mean,
I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?

1109
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:25,279
- Mm-hmm.
- Stephanie's heard this a thousand times...

1110
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:28,719
but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance...

1111
01:12:28,824 --> 01:12:31,757
I would've made a fortune
when they put in that, uh--

1112
01:12:31,858 --> 01:12:33,949
- Home Depot.
- Home Depot.

1113
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,891
And those stores.
And your father knew about it too.

1114
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:38,897
He's such a fuckin' chickenshit.

1115
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:42,694
Always was.
Just a fuckin'chickenshit.

1116
01:12:42,801 --> 01:12:45,132
Just too scared.

1117
01:12:45,237 --> 01:12:48,204
- Is this bothering you? You sure?
- It's fine. Yeah.

1118
01:12:50,942 --> 01:12:53,909
Hey, man. I'm gonna just make sure
that Siena and Stephanie get home safe.

1119
01:12:54,013 --> 01:12:56,479
- Okay.
- All right. Maybe we'll hook up with you later.

1120
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,046
Sure. Whatever. Maybe I'll
go catch a movie or something.

1121
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:02,015
- See you later, Miles.
- Thanks, Stephanie. See you.

1122
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:04,018
- Bye, Siena.
- Bye.

1123
01:13:04,121 --> 01:13:06,520
- Caryl, very nice meeting you.
- I loved talking with you.

1124
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:10,486
- Thanks.
- If you go out later, call me on my cell.

1125
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:13,219
Okay!

1126
01:13:24,837 --> 01:13:27,463
- Okay. That's it?
- Yeah.

1127
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:31,339
Actually, could I get a, uh--
a Barely Legal, please?

1128
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:35,003
Thank you. No, actually--
Sorry. The new one.

1129
01:13:35,112 --> 01:13:37,011
Okay.

1130
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,116
Thanks.

1131
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:02,927
What-- Oh.

1132
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:54,201
- Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?
- Hey.

1133
01:14:54,314 --> 01:14:57,406
Oh, you know me. I love it up here.

1134
01:14:57,518 --> 01:15:00,485
- How 'bout you?
- Busy for a Tuesday night.

1135
01:15:00,587 --> 01:15:03,315
We had a busload of old folks
on a wine tour.

1136
01:15:03,422 --> 01:15:06,389
Usually they're not too rowdy,
but tonight something was going on.

1137
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:09,459
I don't know. A full moon or something.
Anyway, what can I get you?

1138
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,288
- Highliner.
- Glass or bottle?

1139
01:15:12,397 --> 01:15:15,592
- Bottle.
- You got it.

1140
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:17,998
Say, is, uh, Maya working?

1141
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:21,399
Maya? Uh, no, I haven't seen her.

1142
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:23,802
I think she's off tonight.

1143
01:15:35,817 --> 01:15:38,784
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1144
01:16:16,586 --> 01:16:19,348
Ah, crap.

1145
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:22,183
- Did you ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
- Nope.

1146
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,189
- Hmm?
- No.

1147
01:16:24,294 --> 01:16:26,954
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie'll tell you.

1148
01:16:27,061 --> 01:16:29,687
- Could you just give me a little room? Please?
- Yeah.

1149
01:16:29,796 --> 01:16:31,695
Thank you.

1150
01:16:31,798 --> 01:16:35,254
In life, you gotta strike
while the iron's hot. Iron is hot.

1151
01:16:35,368 --> 01:16:37,994
Sage advice,Jack.

1152
01:16:38,104 --> 01:16:40,832
- Now, remember, sit back on your heels.
- Mm-hmm.

1153
01:16:40,939 --> 01:16:44,304
All right?
Turn through the abdomen.

1154
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:46,876
Abdomen.

1155
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:49,605
- Oh, for cryin'--
- Nice.

1156
01:16:49,713 --> 01:16:52,179
What about your agent?
You hear anything yet?

1157
01:16:52,283 --> 01:16:55,216
- Nope.
- What do you think's going on?

1158
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:58,285
- Could be anything.
- You been checking your messages?

1159
01:16:58,387 --> 01:17:01,047
- Obsessively.
- Huh.

1160
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:04,182
Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss off
another three years of my life.

1161
01:17:04,293 --> 01:17:06,486
But you haven't heard anything yet...

1162
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:10,154
so don't you think your negativity's
a little premature?

1163
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:14,164
Hmm? All right. You know,
fuck the New York publishers.

1164
01:17:14,268 --> 01:17:16,734
Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in.

1165
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:19,667
Just get it out there.
Get it reviewed.

1166
01:17:19,774 --> 01:17:23,071
Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.

1167
01:17:28,981 --> 01:17:31,004
Don't come over the top.

1168
01:17:31,115 --> 01:17:33,308
- Stay still.
- Shut up.

1169
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:37,009
It's all about stillness.

1170
01:17:37,122 --> 01:17:40,556
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1171
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:43,453
Jesus Christ, man!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1172
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,392
Please,just shut up! Fuck!

1173
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,793
- God.
- What's with the hostility, man?

1174
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,456
I know you're a little frustrated
with your life right now...

1175
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:56,333
but you can choose to be less hostile.

1176
01:17:59,973 --> 01:18:02,462
The fucker hit into us.

1177
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,237
Hurry it up, will ya?

1178
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:08,676
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1179
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:12,476
Hey, that's not cool, asshole!

1180
01:18:24,427 --> 01:18:27,394
Nice shot.Jackoffs.

1181
01:18:27,497 --> 01:18:31,659
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oops. Look out.

1182
01:18:33,136 --> 01:18:35,898
Uh? Uh-huh.

1183
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:39,631
Oh. Oh, check it out.

1184
01:18:39,741 --> 01:18:43,038
- This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.
- Go to it.

1185
01:18:51,952 --> 01:18:55,408
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool, smart
chicks like that require persistence.

1186
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,988
I don't wanna talk about it, please.

1187
01:18:58,091 --> 01:19:00,717
All I know is that she's beautiful,
a lot of soul.

1188
01:19:00,825 --> 01:19:02,791
She's perfect for you.

1189
01:19:02,894 --> 01:19:06,157
I'm just not gonna feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

1190
01:19:06,265 --> 01:19:09,994
Don't you want to feel that cozy little box
grip down on your johnson?

1191
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:12,967
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

1192
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:15,436
A woman finds out how I live...

1193
01:19:15,538 --> 01:19:18,903
that I'm not a published author,
that I'm a liar, essentially...

1194
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:22,566
any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.

1195
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:26,306
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not even in the game anymore.

1196
01:19:26,415 --> 01:19:30,008
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

1197
01:19:30,118 --> 01:19:34,074
- Abattoir. What is that?
- Slaughterhouse.

1198
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:37,212
Abattoir. Huh.
But you know what?

1199
01:19:37,323 --> 01:19:39,289
You are gonna be
a published author...

1200
01:19:39,393 --> 01:19:42,622
because you're gonna get the good news
this week about your book.

1201
01:19:42,729 --> 01:19:46,322
I know you are. I can feel it.

1202
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,330
Huh. Stephanie.

1203
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:51,195
Hey, honey. Yeah.

1204
01:19:51,302 --> 01:19:53,768
Yeah. Yeah.

1205
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:55,770
Yeah!

1206
01:20:00,443 --> 01:20:02,466
- Hey.
- Hi.

1207
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:11,146
Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped by
the restaurant to see me last night.

1208
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:13,584
Oh, yeah. No. I mean, uh, yeah.

1209
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:16,316
I stopped by for a drink.
I didn't see you.

1210
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:18,324
- I had class.
- Oh.

1211
01:20:18,426 --> 01:20:21,052
Well, nice to see you now.

1212
01:20:21,161 --> 01:20:23,127
It's good to see you too.

1213
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:34,666
Syrah.

1214
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:38,572
Oldest Syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.

1215
01:20:38,677 --> 01:20:41,838
Did you know that?

1216
01:20:41,947 --> 01:20:43,970
You didn't know that?

1217
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:49,175
The pinot noir grape
has been cultivated perhaps...

1218
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:52,652
since antiquity in Burgundy.

1219
01:20:52,756 --> 01:20:55,450
And it is precisely this ancient...

1220
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:58,821
and inherited winemaking
knowledge...

1221
01:20:58,928 --> 01:21:01,486
that has contributed to its success.

1222
01:22:04,851 --> 01:22:07,182
- I was, like, 1 6, 1 7.
- Really?

1223
01:22:07,285 --> 01:22:09,410
Yeah. I'm gonna die!

1224
01:22:09,522 --> 01:22:11,954
- Oh, God. What a drag.
- Mom?

1225
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,956
- Oh.
- Oh, hey. Hi.

1226
01:22:14,058 --> 01:22:17,025
Is it too loud?

1227
01:22:17,127 --> 01:22:20,754
Sorry. Oh, UncleJack
will put you back to bed.

1228
01:22:20,865 --> 01:22:22,831
Come here, little sister. Ooh!

1229
01:22:22,933 --> 01:22:25,900
We'll be more quiet, okay?

1230
01:22:26,002 --> 01:22:29,958
- Good night. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1231
01:22:30,072 --> 01:22:33,470
My favorite, as far as ice cream--

1232
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:34,241
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey.!

1233
01:22:34,243 --> 01:22:36,540
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey.!

1234
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:03,395
You guys should come by
the restaurant for lunch today.

1235
01:25:03,504 --> 01:25:06,960
- Great. What's the latest we can get there?
- About 2:30.

1236
01:25:10,075 --> 01:25:12,871
Did you hear about this Bordeaux
tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara...

1237
01:25:12,977 --> 01:25:14,876
on Saturday night?

1238
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:19,109
It's kind of pricey,
but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.

1239
01:25:19,217 --> 01:25:21,683
Why don't you just stay
for the weekend?

1240
01:25:21,786 --> 01:25:24,981
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

1241
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:27,055
What rehearsal dinner?

1242
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,357
Who's getting married?

1243
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:34,621
- Were you ever gonna say anything?
- Yes, of course I was.

1244
01:25:34,731 --> 01:25:37,197
Just now I could've told you
some story, but I didn't.

1245
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:41,165
- I told you the truth. Maya!
- Don't touch me!

1246
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,236
Just take me home.

1247
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:47,361
Do you have any idea
what he's been saying to her?

1248
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:51,169
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

1249
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,407
How she's the only woman that's ever
rocked his world, how he adores Siena...

1250
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:59,813
how he wants to move here and
get a place with the two of them
and commute when he has to.

1251
01:25:59,919 --> 01:26:02,647
I'm sure he believed every word of it.

1252
01:26:02,754 --> 01:26:05,085
Please believe me.

1253
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:08,088
I was on the verge
of telling you last night, but--

1254
01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:11,286
But you wanted to fuck me first.

1255
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:15,226
Oh, Maya. No.

1256
01:26:15,332 --> 01:26:17,231
Yeah.

1257
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:31,970
You know, I've just spent
the last three years of my life...

1258
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,344
trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception...

1259
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,416
and I'm doing just fine.

1260
01:26:40,286 --> 01:26:44,914
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce...

1261
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:47,993
so this has been a big deal for me,
Maya.

1262
01:26:48,094 --> 01:26:52,358
Hanging out with you and, uh--
and last night.

1263
01:26:52,465 --> 01:26:55,796
I really like you, Maya...

1264
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,356
and I am notJack.

1265
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:02,437
I'm-- I'm--

1266
01:27:02,539 --> 01:27:06,735
I'm his freshman year roommate
from San Diego State.

1267
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:34,798
There's my boy!

1268
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:37,866
There he is.
But who's your daddy?

1269
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:40,767
- Who is your daddy? Oh!
-Jack, come on.

1270
01:27:40,873 --> 01:27:43,431
- Oh, let me love you.
- Let go. Oh!

1271
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:46,337
Let me down,Jack.

1272
01:27:46,444 --> 01:27:49,411
I am so proud of you.
Ah. Mmm. Mmm.

1273
01:27:49,513 --> 01:27:52,105
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. All right. Details.

1274
01:27:52,214 --> 01:27:55,147
- I love details.
- No.

1275
01:27:55,252 --> 01:27:59,117
- What?
-Jesus. It's private.

1276
01:27:59,221 --> 01:28:02,347
You better tell me what happened,
or I'll tie your dick in a knot.

1277
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:05,755
Let's just leave it, okay?

1278
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:10,317
You didn't get any, did you?

1279
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:13,557
- You're a homo.
- Yeah, right. Yup, I'm a homo.

1280
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,567
Yeah. Yeah.

1281
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:18,898
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened.

1282
01:28:19,005 --> 01:28:21,972
Write out my gay confession,
and I'll sign it.

1283
01:28:22,075 --> 01:28:25,736
Okay? Just stop pushing me
all the time.

1284
01:28:25,844 --> 01:28:27,901
You're an infant,Jack.

1285
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:31,343
- This is all a big party for you...
- Okay.

1286
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:33,781
- but not for me.
- Come on.

1287
01:28:33,884 --> 01:28:35,850
I'm sorry, man.

1288
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,753
Did you have trouble performing?

1289
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:45,350
Yeah, that's it.

1290
01:28:45,461 --> 01:28:48,428
Don't answer it.

1291
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:50,430
Don't answer it.

1292
01:28:50,532 --> 01:28:53,930
- Jack.
- Hello.

1293
01:28:54,035 --> 01:28:56,797
Yeah.

1294
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:59,201
Uh-huh. It's Christine.

1295
01:28:59,306 --> 01:29:03,604
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1296
01:29:03,709 --> 01:29:05,675
Hey, let me call you right back.

1297
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,474
Miles and I are kinda
in the middle of something.

1298
01:29:08,582 --> 01:29:13,073
Nah, it's nothing serious.Just--
He's having one ofhis freak-outs. Yeah.

1299
01:29:13,185 --> 01:29:16,949
I love you too. I'll call you back.

1300
01:29:17,054 --> 01:29:21,284
This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1301
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:24,620
I just want to go home.

1302
01:29:25,996 --> 01:29:28,063
I know what you need.

1303
01:29:28,065 --> 01:29:28,758
I know what you need.

1304
01:29:28,865 --> 01:29:31,331
How 'bout this one?
We didn't hit this one.

1305
01:29:31,435 --> 01:29:33,993
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

1306
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:38,400
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1307
01:30:13,336 --> 01:30:15,962
It tastes like the back
of a fucking L.A. school bus.

1308
01:30:16,072 --> 01:30:18,504
Now, they probably didn't de-stem...

1309
01:30:18,608 --> 01:30:21,074
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

1310
01:30:21,176 --> 01:30:23,473
Crushed it up with leaves and mice...

1311
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:27,377
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1312
01:30:27,482 --> 01:30:29,448
Fuckin' Raid.

1313
01:30:30,984 --> 01:30:32,973
Tastes pretty good to me.

1314
01:30:33,087 --> 01:30:36,213
Hmm. Look.
They have a reserve pinot.

1315
01:30:36,323 --> 01:30:39,085
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

1316
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:42,523
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.
- Okay.

1317
01:30:46,298 --> 01:30:48,264
Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

1318
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,355
- Hi,Jennifer. It's Miles again.
- Oh, hi, Miles.

1319
01:30:51,471 --> 01:30:53,370
- Hi.
- Let me see if I can get her.

1320
01:30:53,471 --> 01:30:55,437
Okay.

1321
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:58,836
- You're in luck. I'll put you through.
- Okay.

1322
01:31:01,444 --> 01:31:03,637
- Hi, Miles.
- Hi, Evelyn.

1323
01:31:03,745 --> 01:31:05,644
It's your favorite client.

1324
01:31:05,747 --> 01:31:08,373
- How's the trip?
- Oh, it's good, it's good.

1325
01:31:08,485 --> 01:31:11,179
You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

1326
01:31:11,287 --> 01:31:13,753
- It's very nice.
- Right.

1327
01:31:13,855 --> 01:31:16,515
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

1328
01:31:16,624 --> 01:31:18,613
Well, actually, there is word.

1329
01:31:18,726 --> 01:31:21,192
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman
this morning.

1330
01:31:21,294 --> 01:31:23,193
Right. And?

1331
01:31:23,296 --> 01:31:25,819
And... they're passing.

1332
01:31:27,501 --> 01:31:31,833
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.

1333
01:31:31,937 --> 01:31:35,996
They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.

1334
01:31:36,108 --> 01:31:39,166
He said it was a really tough call.

1335
01:31:40,744 --> 01:31:42,643
Oh. Right.

1336
01:31:42,745 --> 01:31:45,371
I'm sorry, Miles.

1337
01:31:45,483 --> 01:31:47,676
So I don't know where that leaves us.

1338
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:52,344
I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.

1339
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:56,549
I think it's one of those unfortunate cases
in the business right now--

1340
01:31:56,658 --> 01:32:00,683
a-a fabulous book with no home.

1341
01:32:00,796 --> 01:32:03,524
The whole industry's gotten gutless.

1342
01:32:03,632 --> 01:32:06,292
It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.

1343
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,593
It's only about the marketing.

1344
01:32:13,072 --> 01:32:16,870
- Excuse me. Could I get
a, uh, pour down here, please?
- Sure.

1345
01:32:16,975 --> 01:32:20,908
There's a, uh, special
on the Syrah by the case.

1346
01:32:22,148 --> 01:32:24,114
Hit me again.

1347
01:32:28,152 --> 01:32:30,118
Thanks.

1348
01:32:31,555 --> 01:32:34,021
Excuse me.
Could you just pour me a full glass?

1349
01:32:34,124 --> 01:32:36,090
I'll pay for it, okay?

1350
01:32:37,694 --> 01:32:41,059
Sir, this is a winery, not a bar.

1351
01:32:41,163 --> 01:32:43,288
Oh. Come on.

1352
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:45,991
Just give me a full goddamn pour.

1353
01:32:47,703 --> 01:32:49,794
Excuse me.

1354
01:32:49,904 --> 01:32:53,360
Why don't you buy a bottle,
then go outside?

1355
01:32:56,778 --> 01:32:59,745
- What are you doing?
- I told you I need a drink,
so I'm going to help myself.

1356
01:32:59,845 --> 01:33:02,244
- Okay, pal? What do you think?
- Put the glass down.

1357
01:33:02,347 --> 01:33:04,813
Let go of the fucking glass, fucker!

1358
01:33:10,854 --> 01:33:13,514
Mmm.

1359
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:17,923
- That's that.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.

1360
01:33:18,028 --> 01:33:19,994
- It's okay.
- Get him out ofhere.

1361
01:33:20,097 --> 01:33:23,895
- Thanks a lot!
- It's okay. His, uh-- His mother just died.

1362
01:33:27,903 --> 01:33:30,870
So you'll write another one.
You've got lots of ideas, right?

1363
01:33:30,974 --> 01:33:33,532
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

1364
01:33:33,642 --> 01:33:36,165
I'm a middle school English teacher.

1365
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,078
Ah, the world doesn't give a shit
what I have to say.

1366
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:43,148
I'm unnecessary.

1367
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:47,048
I'm so insignificant,
I can't even kill myself.

1368
01:33:47,153 --> 01:33:49,619
Miles, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1369
01:33:49,723 --> 01:33:51,622
Come on, man. You know.

1370
01:33:51,725 --> 01:33:54,886
Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.

1371
01:33:54,993 --> 01:33:57,960
You can't kill yourself
before you've even been published.

1372
01:34:00,631 --> 01:34:04,429
- What about the guy that wrote
Confederacy Of Dunces?

1373
01:34:04,535 --> 01:34:09,060
He committed suicide before he
was published. Look how famous he is.

1374
01:34:10,906 --> 01:34:12,805
Thanks.

1375
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:20,110
Just don't give up. All right?
You're gonna make it.

1376
01:34:20,215 --> 01:34:22,738
Half my life is over...

1377
01:34:22,851 --> 01:34:26,807
and I have nothing
to show for it, nothing.

1378
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:30,355
I'm a thumbprint
on the window of a skyscraper.

1379
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:34,413
I'm a smudge of excrement
on a tissue...

1380
01:34:34,527 --> 01:34:38,655
surging out to sea
with a million tons of raw sewage.

1381
01:34:38,763 --> 01:34:41,457
See? Right there.

1382
01:34:41,567 --> 01:34:44,090
Just what you just said?
That is beautiful.

1383
01:34:44,202 --> 01:34:47,829
"A smudge of excrement
surging out to sea."

1384
01:34:47,938 --> 01:34:51,064
- Yeah.
- I could never write that.

1385
01:34:51,175 --> 01:34:54,142
Neither could I, actually.
I think it's Bukowski.

1386
01:35:18,633 --> 01:35:22,761
Hey, baby.

1387
01:35:24,237 --> 01:35:26,703
- Look what I got for our favorite girl.
- Motherfucker!

1388
01:35:26,806 --> 01:35:31,434
-Jesus Christ!
- You fucking lying piece of shit!

1389
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:35,636
You're getting married on Saturday?
What's with all that shit you said to me?

1390
01:35:35,747 --> 01:35:38,213
- Stephanie, stop!
- I can explain.!

1391
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:40,941
- You said you loved me!
- I do.!

1392
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,211
- I hope you die!
- Stop it, Stephanie!

1393
01:35:52,261 --> 01:35:55,820
Fuckface! You too!

1394
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:57,418
Me?

1395
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,460
- You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
- No, I did not.

1396
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,536
No, I did not.

1397
01:36:04,637 --> 01:36:07,069
It must have been Gary
at The Hitching Post.

1398
01:36:07,172 --> 01:36:09,638
I think we mentioned it to him
the first night.

1399
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:13,303
Oh, did we mention it?
You mentioned it, asshole!

1400
01:36:13,412 --> 01:36:16,004
I'm fucking hurting over here.

1401
01:36:16,115 --> 01:36:18,104
Keep it elevated.

1402
01:36:22,919 --> 01:36:26,875
No, I don't want anything.

1403
01:36:31,594 --> 01:36:33,822
Uh, it's Miles.

1404
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:38,886
I had to call and, uh, tell you again...

1405
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,297
how much I enjoyed
our time together...

1406
01:36:41,402 --> 01:36:44,335
and, uh, how sorry I am...

1407
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,407
that things turned out
the way they did.

1408
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:52,807
I think you're great, Maya.

1409
01:36:52,913 --> 01:36:56,869
Uh, I always have from the first time
that you, uh, waited on me.

1410
01:36:59,351 --> 01:37:02,716
Uh, and while I'm at it...

1411
01:37:02,822 --> 01:37:06,483
uh, I guess maybe you
should know that my book...

1412
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:09,854
is not getting published.

1413
01:37:09,961 --> 01:37:13,917
I thought this one, uh, had a chance,
but I was wrong again.

1414
01:37:15,231 --> 01:37:17,823
Once again.

1415
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:20,695
So you see, uh...

1416
01:37:20,804 --> 01:37:23,930
I'm not really much of a writer.

1417
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,007
I am not much of anything, really.

1418
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:42,909
I'm gonna have to have an operation,
maybe even a couple of'em.

1419
01:37:43,022 --> 01:37:46,319
They're gonna wait for my nose to heal first,
then they break it again.

1420
01:37:46,425 --> 01:37:49,620
Oh, Christ. Good thing
you have a voice-over career.

1421
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:53,422
It's gonna fuck that up too.
I oughta sue her ass.

1422
01:37:53,531 --> 01:37:56,020
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.

1423
01:37:56,134 --> 01:37:58,362
- That's thoughtful.
- Yeah.

1424
01:38:02,471 --> 01:38:05,029
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?

1425
01:38:05,142 --> 01:38:07,439
We didn't get into that with Gary.

1426
01:38:09,345 --> 01:38:12,540
Huh. That's-- Yeah, let me think.

1427
01:38:12,648 --> 01:38:17,276
- You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
- Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.

1428
01:38:17,385 --> 01:38:20,409
And just what are you implying,Jack?

1429
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:24,182
I'm really pissed off at you about all this,
if you want to know the truth.

1430
01:38:24,291 --> 01:38:28,350
What is Maya going to think of me now,
just for associating with you?

1431
01:38:31,898 --> 01:38:35,423
I don't know. Sure seems fishy.

1432
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:37,558
Well.

1433
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:42,159
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat...

1434
01:38:42,274 --> 01:38:44,399
I'll be there.

1435
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:47,703
Wherever there's a cop
beating up a guy...

1436
01:38:47,812 --> 01:38:50,643
I'll be there.

1437
01:38:50,748 --> 01:38:54,204
I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.

1438
01:38:54,317 --> 01:38:56,283
What's this look like to you?

1439
01:38:57,887 --> 01:39:01,252
Uh, it looks like you were
in a bad car accident.

1440
01:39:01,356 --> 01:39:06,553
When the people
are eating the stuff they raised--

1441
01:39:06,662 --> 01:39:09,094
I'm hungry.

1442
01:39:12,532 --> 01:39:15,294
Here we go.

1443
01:39:15,402 --> 01:39:18,335
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1444
01:39:18,437 --> 01:39:21,962
- And here is your Handi Wipes.
- Oh.

1445
01:39:22,073 --> 01:39:26,667
So that's what those are. For a minute
I thought you were promoting safe sex.

1446
01:39:26,778 --> 01:39:29,711
That's a good one.
I'll have to remember that one.

1447
01:39:29,813 --> 01:39:33,008
- I'll be right back with your corn bread.
- All righty.

1448
01:39:36,586 --> 01:39:39,052
Bet you that chick's two tons of fun.

1449
01:39:39,155 --> 01:39:41,781
- You know, the grateful type?
- Mm-mmm.

1450
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:44,257
I don't know.
I wouldn't know about that.

1451
01:39:47,929 --> 01:39:49,895
Mmm.

1452
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,098
- Hmm.
- Here you go.

1453
01:39:54,834 --> 01:39:57,528
Nice technique there... Cammi.

1454
01:39:57,636 --> 01:40:00,603
Thank you. All in the wrist.

1455
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:03,504
You know,
you look really familiar to me.

1456
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:06,839
- Are you from around here?
- Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?

1457
01:40:06,947 --> 01:40:10,472
I don't know.
You just seemed really familiar to me.

1458
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:13,810
- Never mind. Enjoy your meal.
- Hang on. Hang on.

1459
01:40:13,918 --> 01:40:17,647
Um, did you ever know
a Derek Sommersby?

1460
01:40:17,756 --> 01:40:22,054
Dr. Derek Sommersby
from One Life To Live?

1461
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:27,826
Just have to imagine him
with a bandage and shorter hair.

1462
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:34,364
No way!

1463
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:37,198
No way! Oh, my gosh!

1464
01:40:37,305 --> 01:40:41,238
That's great.! Oh, my goodness.!

1465
01:40:41,342 --> 01:40:43,808
Could you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

1466
01:40:43,911 --> 01:40:47,538
Oh, yeah. It's right over there,
right past the buffalo. Wow!

1467
01:40:47,648 --> 01:40:51,673
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
you're sitting at my table.

1468
01:41:17,172 --> 01:41:20,401
Listen, man, Cammi gets off
in an hour, so I was thinking...

1469
01:41:20,508 --> 01:41:23,475
I'd just hang around, have a drink.

1470
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:27,137
You know, make sure she gets home safe.

1471
01:41:27,249 --> 01:41:30,148
You're joking, right?

1472
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:32,774
No.

1473
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:34,785
Un-fucking-believable.

1474
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:40,323
Can't we just go back to the motel
and hang out...

1475
01:41:40,426 --> 01:41:43,484
get up early,
play nine holes of golf...

1476
01:41:43,595 --> 01:41:45,561
before we head home?

1477
01:41:49,466 --> 01:41:52,433
Listen, man, you're my friend...

1478
01:41:52,536 --> 01:41:55,503
and I know you care about me.

1479
01:41:55,606 --> 01:41:58,266
I know you disapprove,
and I respect that.

1480
01:41:58,374 --> 01:42:03,036
But there are some things that I have to do
that you don't understand.

1481
01:42:03,147 --> 01:42:07,946
You understand literature,
movies, wine...

1482
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:10,516
but you don't understand my plight.

1483
01:42:30,002 --> 01:42:32,594
Yeah?

1484
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:36,035
- Holy shit!Jesus Christ!
- Fuck. Fuck.

1485
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:39,403
God, it's fucking freezing out there!

1486
01:42:39,511 --> 01:42:42,478
- God, yeah.
- Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin?

1487
01:42:42,579 --> 01:42:44,545
Uh--

1488
01:42:47,117 --> 01:42:50,107
Oh.

1489
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:52,118
Here.

1490
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,119
Oh. Oh.

1491
01:42:57,626 --> 01:42:59,923
Fucking chick's married, man.

1492
01:43:00,028 --> 01:43:02,325
What?

1493
01:43:02,429 --> 01:43:04,918
Her husband works the night shift, and he
comes home and catches me on the floor...

1494
01:43:05,033 --> 01:43:07,124
with my cock in his wife's ass.

1495
01:43:07,234 --> 01:43:11,190
Oh,Jesus Christ.Jesus.Jack!

1496
01:43:11,304 --> 01:43:14,635
- And you walked all the way from Solvang?
- No, ran.

1497
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:16,707
Twisted my ankle too.

1498
01:43:16,808 --> 01:43:20,003
- That's five klicks,Jack.
- Fuckin'-A right, it's five klicks.

1499
01:43:20,112 --> 01:43:23,204
At one point I had to cut
through an ostrich farm.

1500
01:43:23,315 --> 01:43:26,612
Those fuckers are mean.

1501
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:35,090
Whoo!

1502
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:40,991
- Oh.!
- We gotta go back.

1503
01:43:41,096 --> 01:43:43,962
What?

1504
01:43:44,065 --> 01:43:47,260
We gotta go back. I left my wallet.

1505
01:43:47,367 --> 01:43:49,333
Credit cards, cash, my fucking I.D.

1506
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:51,904
- Everything. We gotta go back.
- Big deal. It's fine.

1507
01:43:52,005 --> 01:43:55,200
Don't worry about it. We'll call now
and we'll cancel your cards.

1508
01:43:55,308 --> 01:43:58,139
No, Miles,you don't understand.
The wedding rings.

1509
01:43:58,244 --> 01:44:00,143
The wedding rings are in my wallet.

1510
01:44:00,246 --> 01:44:05,180
Fine, they're in your wallet, and you
left your wallet in some bar, okay?

1511
01:44:05,283 --> 01:44:07,875
- Christine will understand.
- She had to order them special.

1512
01:44:07,987 --> 01:44:09,886
It took her forever to find 'em.

1513
01:44:09,988 --> 01:44:14,150
They've got this design of dolphins
and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

1514
01:44:14,259 --> 01:44:17,818
We gotta go back, man.
Christine will fucking crucify me, Miles.

1515
01:44:17,928 --> 01:44:19,951
No way, no way, no way.

1516
01:44:20,062 --> 01:44:22,051
Please. Please!

1517
01:44:22,165 --> 01:44:25,428
Forget it.
Your wallet was stolen in some bar.

1518
01:44:25,536 --> 01:44:28,503
- It happens every day.
- No, we gotta go back and get my wallet, Miles.

1519
01:44:28,604 --> 01:44:32,265
I'm telling you,
those rings are irreplaceable.

1520
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:35,501
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.

1521
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:37,575
- But you've gotta help me.
- Yeah.

1522
01:44:37,678 --> 01:44:41,271
You've gotta help me, Miles,
please.! Please.!

1523
01:44:41,382 --> 01:44:43,679
I can't lose Christine, Miles.

1524
01:44:43,784 --> 01:44:46,444
I just-- I can't.
I can't lose Christine.

1525
01:44:46,553 --> 01:44:48,746
- Mm-hmm.
- I know I fucked up.

1526
01:44:48,855 --> 01:44:52,754
I know I did a bad thing, all right?
And I know I'm a bad person.

1527
01:44:52,858 --> 01:44:57,292
I know I am. But you gotta help me!
You have to help me, Miles.

1528
01:44:57,395 --> 01:45:00,851
Okay? Tell me you'll help me.

1529
01:45:00,965 --> 01:45:03,727
If I lose Christine, I-I-I--

1530
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:05,924
I'm nothing.

1531
01:45:06,036 --> 01:45:09,470
I just have-- I'm nothing.

1532
01:45:09,573 --> 01:45:11,596
God.

1533
01:45:11,707 --> 01:45:14,139
- Did she tell you she was married?
- Yeah.

1534
01:45:14,242 --> 01:45:16,208
So what the fuck were you thinking?

1535
01:45:16,313 --> 01:45:19,872
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6:00.
Fucker rolls in at 5:00.

1536
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:23,005
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

1537
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:25,413
- This is the block.
- You sure?

1538
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,486
Yeah.

1539
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,789
That's it. That's it.

1540
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:34,857
That's the one right there.

1541
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:37,053
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1542
01:45:37,163 --> 01:45:39,129
Okay.

1543
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:46,657
All right.
Okay, so what's the plan?

1544
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:49,259
Uh, the plan is...

1545
01:45:49,372 --> 01:45:51,271
you go.

1546
01:45:51,376 --> 01:45:54,434
- Me?
- 'Cause of my ankle.

1547
01:45:54,544 --> 01:45:57,511
Still hurts.Just go explain
the situation, Miles.

1548
01:45:57,614 --> 01:46:00,206
Explain the situation. Yes.

1549
01:46:00,316 --> 01:46:04,580
"Excuse me, sir. My friend was the one
balling your wife a couple of hours ago.

1550
01:46:04,685 --> 01:46:07,811
"Really sorry. He seems to
have left his wallet behind.

1551
01:46:07,922 --> 01:46:10,889
I was wondering if I could come in
and just poke around. I don't know."

1552
01:46:10,992 --> 01:46:14,118
- Yeah,just like that. That's good.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

1553
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:20,825
Oh, fuck it! I'll go.
I guess I have to do everything.

1554
01:46:20,934 --> 01:46:24,424
No. Hold on.

1555
01:48:10,493 --> 01:48:13,460
You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now.

1556
01:48:13,564 --> 01:48:16,690
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.!

1557
01:48:16,799 --> 01:48:19,288
You picked him up and you fucked him,
didn't you, bitch?

1558
01:48:19,402 --> 01:48:23,097
Yeah, I picked him up and I fucked him.
I'm a bad girl.!

1559
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:25,865
You liked fucking him,
didn't you, you little whore?

1560
01:48:25,973 --> 01:48:30,135
I liked it when you caught me fucking him!
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!

1561
01:48:30,244 --> 01:48:32,143
You are a bad bitch.

1562
01:48:32,246 --> 01:48:34,712
- Yeah, you caught me.
- You're such a whore.

1563
01:48:34,815 --> 01:48:37,146
Oh,yeah.!

1564
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:40,046
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, it's so good.!

1565
01:48:42,222 --> 01:48:44,121
I fucked him.

1566
01:48:44,223 --> 01:48:47,452
- You're so bad.
- I am. Yeah.

1567
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:53,290
You are such a whore.

1568
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:57,924
- What the fuck.!
- The wallet.! He's got Derek's wallet.!

1569
01:48:58,035 --> 01:49:00,934
I think they
were surprised by the level of protest...

1570
01:49:01,037 --> 01:49:03,765
that was really happening
within the company.

1571
01:49:03,873 --> 01:49:08,807
The injustice may be their plan,
and they said, "Well, we can'tjust go--"

1572
01:49:08,911 --> 01:49:12,810
- Oh! Here's your wallet! Oh, shit!
- Motherfucker!

1573
01:49:12,914 --> 01:49:15,380
Open the goddamn door!

1574
01:49:15,484 --> 01:49:17,450
- I'm gonna kill your ass.!
- You got it.! You got my wallet.!

1575
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:22,350
I'll find you! I will find you, bub!
I'll find your ass!

1576
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:25,581
You're mine, man! You're mine!

1577
01:49:25,693 --> 01:49:28,319
Fuck you.! I'm gonna get your ass.!

1578
01:49:59,355 --> 01:50:03,983
- You wanna let me drive?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

1579
01:50:04,091 --> 01:50:07,547
Hey, you know, you oughta
invite Maya to the wedding.

1580
01:50:07,662 --> 01:50:09,561
Hmm.

1581
01:50:09,663 --> 01:50:12,425
Somehow I think
inviting Maya to the wedding...

1582
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:15,589
is not the right move
at this juncture.

1583
01:50:15,701 --> 01:50:17,600
I don't know.

1584
01:50:17,704 --> 01:50:19,670
In fact,
after all of your shenanigans...

1585
01:50:19,772 --> 01:50:22,796
it's gonna be hard for me
to ever go to The Hitching Post again.

1586
01:50:22,907 --> 01:50:25,874
You know, there was a nice way
to respond to that.

1587
01:50:25,978 --> 01:50:29,434
- Come on. Let me drive.
- No, I got it. You should rest.

1588
01:50:29,546 --> 01:50:32,412
You know what? I feel like driving.

1589
01:50:32,515 --> 01:50:34,414
Okay.

1590
01:50:34,519 --> 01:50:37,680
Uh... hey, put on your seat belt, okay?

1591
01:50:37,788 --> 01:50:40,119
I was just about to.
What's the problem?

1592
01:50:40,223 --> 01:50:44,680
-Just want to remind you to be safe.
- We missed the entrance.

1593
01:50:44,794 --> 01:50:47,420
What are you doing,Jack?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1594
01:50:47,529 --> 01:50:49,995
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on.

1595
01:50:50,097 --> 01:50:52,394
Jack!

1596
01:50:52,502 --> 01:50:54,401
What the fuck!

1597
01:50:54,502 --> 01:50:57,333
- You said it looked like an accident.
- What the fuck!

1598
01:50:57,437 --> 01:50:59,336
I'll pay for it.

1599
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:04,396
Jesus. Christ,Jack!
Oh, for Ch-- Look at this!

1600
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:07,945
- Huh.
- Oh.

1601
01:51:08,045 --> 01:51:09,944
I don't know.

1602
01:51:10,048 --> 01:51:13,777
Doesn't look like anyone
was injured in this one.

1603
01:51:13,885 --> 01:51:15,784
No. No.

1604
01:51:15,887 --> 01:51:18,513
- Watch your head.
- Yeah.

1605
01:51:18,623 --> 01:51:21,818
Boy, you broke a couple of'em,
you know.

1606
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:24,892
- Whatever. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not "whatever."

1607
01:51:24,994 --> 01:51:27,586
You fuckin' derelict.

1608
01:51:27,698 --> 01:51:29,597
You ready?

1609
01:51:29,698 --> 01:51:32,859
Just get it over with.

1610
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:17,832
Okeydoke. All right.

1611
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:20,770
Well, I guess that's about it.

1612
01:52:20,876 --> 01:52:25,607
- Want to come inside?
- Uh, no. No, you're on your own.

1613
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:29,574
All right. I guess
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

1614
01:52:29,684 --> 01:52:31,650
Yup.

1615
01:52:32,953 --> 01:52:35,146
I love you, man.

1616
01:52:35,255 --> 01:52:37,620
Yeah. Back at ya.

1617
01:52:37,722 --> 01:52:42,179
- Miles, don't drive away until they see the car.
- I know, I know, I know.

1618
01:52:42,294 --> 01:52:45,125
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?

1619
01:52:45,229 --> 01:52:48,685
'Cause you were wearing your seat belt.

1620
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:53,167
Nicely done.

1621
01:53:13,856 --> 01:53:15,822
- Hi.
-Jack.

1622
01:53:15,923 --> 01:53:17,822
- Yeah.
- Uh, Christine, Mike!

1623
01:54:06,434 --> 01:54:08,400
Amen.

1624
01:55:30,971 --> 01:55:33,870
Hey, Miles.

1625
01:55:33,974 --> 01:55:38,431
Hi, Vicki.
Wow, you look beautiful.

1626
01:55:38,546 --> 01:55:40,445
Thanks.

1627
01:55:40,546 --> 01:55:43,240
Um, this is Ken Cortland,
my husband.

1628
01:55:43,349 --> 01:55:45,248
- How are you?
- How are you?

1629
01:55:45,351 --> 01:55:47,340
- Good, thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.

1630
01:55:47,452 --> 01:55:50,850
- You're a lucky guy.
- Yes, I am. Thank you.

1631
01:55:50,955 --> 01:55:53,012
Yeah.

1632
01:55:53,125 --> 01:55:56,024
Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.

1633
01:55:56,128 --> 01:55:59,095
- It was great meeting you, Miles.
- Ken.

1634
01:56:02,832 --> 01:56:06,425
- Well, that was big of him.
- Yeah, he's good that way.

1635
01:56:06,536 --> 01:56:10,469
- He's very considerate.
- That's great.

1636
01:56:10,573 --> 01:56:12,972
So how are you doing?

1637
01:56:13,075 --> 01:56:15,837
Since the last time we spoke?
I don't know.

1638
01:56:15,944 --> 01:56:19,241
Could be better. Could be worse.

1639
01:56:19,348 --> 01:56:23,873
- So what's happening with your book?
- Um, universally rejected.

1640
01:56:23,984 --> 01:56:28,112
- Strike three.
- Oh, Miles, that's awful.

1641
01:56:28,222 --> 01:56:30,916
What are you gonna do?

1642
01:56:31,024 --> 01:56:34,253
Back to the drawing board,
I guess. Or not.

1643
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,986
I don't know.

1644
01:56:37,096 --> 01:56:40,063
So, anyway, you're married.

1645
01:56:40,165 --> 01:56:43,394
Congratulations. You look happy.

1646
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,899
- I am.
- Good.

1647
01:56:46,005 --> 01:56:48,733
Seems like everybody's getting married.

1648
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:52,739
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.

1649
01:56:52,843 --> 01:56:55,810
- Cyclical, I guess.
- I guess.

1650
01:57:01,248 --> 01:57:04,374
Well, uh, what do you say
we hit the reception?

1651
01:57:04,486 --> 01:57:07,510
Have some champagne,
toast the newlyweds, huh?

1652
01:57:07,622 --> 01:57:09,521
Not me. I'm not drinking.

1653
01:57:09,623 --> 01:57:13,717
You quit drinking. Really?

1654
01:57:13,828 --> 01:57:15,794
I'm pregnant.

1655
01:57:17,729 --> 01:57:19,695
I see.

1656
01:57:21,067 --> 01:57:23,533
Yes, I see. Great.

1657
01:57:25,637 --> 01:57:28,604
Well, congratulations again, Vicki.

1658
01:57:28,706 --> 01:57:31,605
Boy, that's wonderful news.

1659
01:57:33,344 --> 01:57:35,970
- See you over there, Miles?
- Yeah.

1660
01:59:40,252 --> 01:59:42,151
Hmm.

1661
01:59:47,826 --> 01:59:51,385
"'The marrow ofhis bone, '
I repeated aimlessly.

1662
01:59:51,495 --> 01:59:53,961
"This, at last, penetrated my mind.

1663
01:59:54,065 --> 01:59:57,089
"Phineas had died
from the marrow of his bone...

1664
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:00,496
"flowing down his bloodstream
to his heart.

1665
02:00:00,603 --> 02:00:03,866
"I did not cry then or ever about Finny.

1666
02:00:03,973 --> 02:00:07,168
"I did not cry even when I stood...

1667
02:00:07,275 --> 02:00:11,073
"watching him being lowered into
his family's straitlaced burial ground...

1668
02:00:11,179 --> 02:00:13,078
"outside of Boston.

1669
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:16,637
"I could not escape the feeling
that this was my own funeral...

1670
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:20,343
and you do not cry in that case. "

1671
02:00:20,454 --> 02:00:23,580
Should I keep reading
the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

1672
02:00:23,689 --> 02:00:27,487
Uh, no, no.
We'll pick up there Monday.

1673
02:01:14,534 --> 02:01:17,400
One new message.

1674
02:01:17,503 --> 02:01:21,631
Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

1675
02:01:21,739 --> 02:01:24,205
Thanks for your letter.

1676
02:01:24,308 --> 02:01:26,297
I-I would have called sooner...

1677
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:29,377
but I think I needed some time to think
about everything that happened...

1678
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:32,936
and what you wrote to me.

1679
02:01:33,050 --> 02:01:35,744
Another reason, um,
I didn't call you sooner...

1680
02:01:35,851 --> 02:01:39,307
is because I wanted to finish your book,
which I finally did last night.

1681
02:01:39,422 --> 02:01:42,446
And I think it's really lovely, Miles.

1682
02:01:42,557 --> 02:01:45,023
You're so good with words.

1683
02:01:45,126 --> 02:01:47,592
Who cares
if it's not getting published?

1684
02:01:47,695 --> 02:01:51,925
There are so many beautiful
and... painful things about it.

1685
02:01:53,233 --> 02:01:55,995
Did you really go through all that?

1686
02:01:56,103 --> 02:01:58,729
Must have been awful.

1687
02:01:58,838 --> 02:02:03,772
And the sister character--
geez, what a wreck.

1688
02:02:03,877 --> 02:02:08,334
But I have to say that, well,
I was really confused by the ending.

1689
02:02:08,447 --> 02:02:11,903
I mean, did the father
finally commit suicide, or what?

1690
02:02:12,016 --> 02:02:13,982
It's driving me crazy.

1691
02:02:16,553 --> 02:02:18,678
Anyway...

1692
02:02:18,788 --> 02:02:22,687
it's turned cold and rainy here lately...

1693
02:02:22,792 --> 02:02:25,418
but I like winter.

1694
02:02:25,528 --> 02:02:30,327
So, listen, if you ever do decide to come
up here again,you should let me know.

1695
02:02:30,433 --> 02:02:33,229
I would say stop by the restaurant,
but to tell you the truth...

1696
02:02:33,335 --> 02:02:35,801
I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be working there...

1697
02:02:35,902 --> 02:02:37,993
because I'm going to graduate soon.

1698
02:02:38,105 --> 02:02:40,628
So I'll probably want to relocate.

1699
02:02:40,741 --> 02:02:42,707
I mean, we'll see.

1700
02:02:44,177 --> 02:02:48,133
Anyway, like I said,
I really loved your novel.

1701
02:02:48,248 --> 02:02:53,148
Don't give up, Miles.
Keep writing.

1702
02:02:53,251 --> 02:02:55,217
I hope you're well.

1703
02:02:56,523 --> 02:02:58,489
Bye.
