1
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,479
<i>Come to Los Angeles.</i>

2
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,647
<i>The sun shines bright.</i>

3
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,025
<i>The beaches are wide and inviting.</i>

4
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:37,112
<i>And the orange groves stretch</i>
<i>as far as the eye can see.</i>

5
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>There are jobs aplenty. Land is cheap.</i>

6
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,702
<i>Every workingman</i>
<i>can have his own house.</i>

7
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:48,290
<i>And inside every house,</i>
<i>a happy all-American family.</i>

8
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,959
<i>You can have all this, and who knows?</i>

9
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:53,754
<i>You could even be discovered...</i>

10
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:57,257
<i>... become a movie star,</i>
<i>or at least see one.</i>

11
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,885
<i>Life is good in Los Angeles.</i>

12
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,888
<i>It's paradise on earth.</i>

13
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,809
<i>That's what they tell you, anyway.</i>

14
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:08,852
<i>Because they're selling an image.</i>

15
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,690
<i>They're selling it through</i>
<i>movies, radio and television.</i>

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,777
<i>In the hit show,</i> Badge of Honor,
<i>the L.A. Cops walk on water...</i>

17
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,904
<i>... as they keep the city clean</i>
<i>of crooks.</i>

18
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,950
<i>You'd think this place</i>
<i>was the Garden of Eden.</i>

19
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:24,952
<i>But there's trouble in paradise...</i>

20
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:30,082
<i>... and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,</i>
<i>Mickey C to his fans.</i>

21
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,960
<i>Local L.A. Color to the nth degree.</i>

22
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:35,462
<i>And his number one bodyguard...</i>

23
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,423
<i>... Johnny Stompanato.</i>

24
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:40,467
<i>Mickey C's the head of organized crime</i>
<i>in these parts.</i>

25
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,054
<i>He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.</i>

26
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,889
<i>He kills a dozen people a year.</i>

27
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:49,059
<i>And the dapper little gent</i>
<i>does it in style.</i>

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,438
<i>And every time his picture's</i>
<i>on the front page...</i>

29
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:55,691
<i>... it's a black eye for the</i>
<i>image of Los Angeles.</i>

30
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,610
<i>Because how can organized crime exist...</i>

31
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,947
<i>... in the city with the best</i>
<i>police force in the world?</i>

32
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,741
<i>Something has to be done.</i>

33
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,994
<i>But nothing too original</i>
<i>because this is Hollywood.</i>

34
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:10,289
<i>What worked for Capone</i>
<i>would work for the Mickster.</i>

35
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,249
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

36
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,793
Non-payment of federal income tax.

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,048
<i>But all is not well. Sending Mickey up</i>
<i>has created a vacuum.</i>

38
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,008
<i>And it's only a matter of time...</i>

39
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:24,887
<i>... before someone with balls</i>
<i>of brass tries to fill it.</i>

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,681
Remember, dear readers...

41
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,267
...you heard it here first...

42
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,978
...off the record...

43
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,397
...on the Q.T...

44
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:37,441
...and very...

45
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,485
<i>... Hush-Hush.</i>

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,880
You're like Santa Claus with that list.

47
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:02,424
Except everyone on it's been naughty.

48
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,345
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

49
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,514
Leave it for later.

50
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,850
We got to pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

51
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,105
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

52
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:20,275
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

53
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:23,320
Parole violation: Assault arising
from a family dispute.

54
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,239
We won't be here but
they'll see him.

55
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,041
Quit your whining!

56
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,544
Quit whining all the time!
It makes me sick!

57
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:39,878
Shut up!

58
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,395
Who the hell are you?

59
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,814
The ghost of Christmas past.

60
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,233
Dance with a man for a change?

61
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,027
You a smart ass?

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,878
You'll be out in a year and a half.
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.

63
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:25,174
Touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie-raper beef.

64
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:29,470
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.

65
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:40,522
You got someplace you can go?

66
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,734
Go get yourself fixed up.

67
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:49,865
Merry Christmas.

68
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,035
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Let's go, Bud.

69
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:54,536
The guys are waiting.

70
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,126
What do you do on <i>Badge of Honor</i>?

71
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,004
I'm the technical advisor.

72
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:07,591
I teach Brett Chase how to
walk and talk like a cop.

73
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,386
Brett Chase doesn't walk
and talk like you.

74
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:12,846
That's because he's the
television version.

75
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,557
America isn't ready for the real me.

76
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:18,519
Is it true you arrested Bob Mitchum?

77
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:23,774
The <i>Badge of Honor</i> guys like to pretend,
but the real thing must be a thrill.

78
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:28,237
Why don't we go someplace quiet?
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.

79
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,823
Big V. Jack Vincennes.

80
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,992
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

81
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,327
This is Sid Hudgens,
<i>Hush-Hush</i> magazine.

82
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:38,122
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello yourself.

83
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,791
What that's about?

84
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,586
Her name was in a piece we did,
"Ingenue Dikes in Hollywood."

85
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,466
My friend just sold reefer
to Matt Reynolds.

86
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:52,845
He's tripping the light fantastic
with Tammy Jordan.

87
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,265
Sorry, I lost you for a second.

88
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:00,894
Contract players, Metro. Pinch them,
I do you up a nice feature next issue.

89
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:03,605
- Plus your usual $50 cash.
- I need another $50.

90
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:07,151
Two 20s for two patrolmen,
a dime for the watch commander.

91
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,652
It's Christmas.

92
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,196
No, it's not.

93
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,615
It's felony possession of marijuana.

94
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:18,537
Actually, it's circulation 36,000
and climbing.

95
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:21,665
There's no telling where this will go.
Radio, television...

96
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:25,794
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.

97
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,969
Sgt. Ed Exley, son of the
legendary Preston Exley.

98
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,846
Must be a hard act to follow.

99
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:40,642
Why not make a mark elsewhere?
Why become a cop?

100
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,895
I like to help people.

101
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,689
We heard 2 officers
were assaulted this evening.

102
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,692
- What do you think of that?
- Goes with the job.

103
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,778
Luckily, they're okay.

104
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,946
Aren't you young to be
watch commander?

105
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:54,114
It's only tonight.

106
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,159
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

107
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,286
That's a good lead for the story.

108
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,038
Merry Christmas, Captain.

109
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,124
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.

110
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,003
- It's Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
- I got the story's title.

111
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:11,006
I'm calling it
"Silent Night with the LAPD."

112
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,716
That's grand.

113
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:16,637
Remember that's "Smith"
with an "S."

114
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,475
Thank you, Merry Christmas.

115
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:22,976
Hold on, lads.

116
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,648
Merry Christmas.

117
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:33,153
I saw the results
on the lieutenant's exam.

118
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:35,114
First out of 23.

119
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:39,118
What'll it be, then? Patrol Division?
Internal Affairs? What?

120
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,036
Detective Bureau.

121
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,669
You're a political animal.

122
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,964
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.

123
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,300
You're wrong, sir.

124
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:59,263
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

125
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,348
...to insure an indictment?

126
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,642
- We've been over this.
- Yes or no?

127
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:08,981
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?

128
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,192
Would you shoot a hardened
criminal in the back...

129
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:15,571
...in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer...

130
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:17,865
Then for the love of God...

131
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:19,825
...don't be a detective.

132
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,703
Stick to assignments where you don't
have to make those choices.

133
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,289
Dudley, I know you mean well...

134
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:29,251
...but I don't need to do it
the way you did... or my father.

135
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,588
At least get rid of the glasses.

136
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:35,507
I can't think of a man
in the Bureau who wears them.

137
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,810
If I ever get held up,
you better be here.

138
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:53,942
Hi, Nick.

139
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:55,611
I need a delivery.

140
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,405
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

141
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:01,116
Sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.

142
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:21,220
Merry Christmas.

143
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,015
Merry Christmas, Officer.

144
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:28,769
That obvious?

145
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,897
It's practically stamped
on your forehead.

146
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,024
There you go.

147
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,976
See what he wants, Buzz.

148
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:16,025
Get lost, why don't you?

149
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,492
Down!
Get your fucking head down.

150
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,536
I got a license for that.

151
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:34,585
Cut me some slack.
I used to be a cop.

152
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,837
"Leland Meeks"?
Never heard of you.

153
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,589
They call me Buzz.

154
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,052
I don't give a rat's ass.
Keep your head down.

155
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,095
And stay there... Buzz.

156
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,391
You okay?

157
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,809
She's fine.

158
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:52,603
I'm not asking you.

159
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:55,647
Who hit you?

160
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,900
It's not what you think.

161
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,363
What, then?

162
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:05,074
You got the wrong idea.
I'm fine.

163
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,744
But it's nice to know you care.

164
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:18,837
Drive safely.

165
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:21,840
What's going on?

166
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:26,929
You know him?

167
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,098
Yeah, I've seen him around.

168
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,518
He used to be a cop.

169
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,236
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.

170
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,446
Put your camera right there.

171
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:48,993
When I walk out, get the
movie premiere in the background.

172
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:52,121
I like it, I like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

173
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:55,332
I don't want those goddamn
floodlights of yours in my eyes.

174
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,127
Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

175
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,671
Come on. Get down.

176
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,509
Go! Pop them!

177
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:11,181
Freeze! Police!

178
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:13,308
Jesus Christ!

179
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,894
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

180
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:17,229
My family's coming...

181
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,774
- It'll be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

182
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,026
Over here.

183
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,236
- Just turn.
- Hold it. Got it!

184
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,366
- The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
- Take them. I'll get the evidence.

185
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,173
"It's Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels.

186
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:47,551
And while decent citizens sleep
the sleep of the righteous...

187
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,470
...hopheads prowl for marijuana...

188
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,766
...not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

189
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,478
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.

190
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:02,024
Scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere."

191
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,734
You like it?

192
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,655
Yeah, subtle.

193
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:10,115
What took you?

194
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,410
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.

195
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:15,663
His priorities are all screwed up.

196
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,207
Up to your old tricks again?

197
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,587
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

198
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,506
What are you doing here?

199
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:27,716
You know, keeping the streets safe.

200
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,344
Get these two dressed
and book them.

201
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,222
- The party's upstairs.
- I'll be right up.

202
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:40,479
What's that for?

203
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,190
Aren't you watch commander tonight?

204
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,316
Yeah. So?

205
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,193
It's from <i>Hush-Hush</i> magazine.

206
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:48,112
Buy yourself some loafers.

207
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,823
No thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.

208
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,741
I'm not interested.

209
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,292
What's this?

210
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:03,669
Six spics.

211
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:07,339
The Mexicans who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.

212
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,426
I hear Helenowski bled 6 pints,
Brown's in a coma.

213
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:12,386
They've got bruises
and muscle pulls.

214
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:13,721
It's not what I heard.

215
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,264
Lock them up.

216
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:20,352
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

217
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:26,066
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.

218
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:31,113
Should make for a very
merry Christmas for them.

219
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:32,197
Hey, guys.

220
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,449
Guys.

221
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:35,534
They brought the Mexicans in.

222
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,245
They're downstairs.

223
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:43,417
- Let's do it.
- Come on. Let's get them.

224
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:48,005
The party's upstairs.

225
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:51,383
This doesn't concern you.

226
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,510
Come on, guys.

227
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:54,887
You got work?

228
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,263
Go back.

229
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,809
- Come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
- Move it!

230
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,270
I just got a few more questions.

231
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,064
You don't have to be here.

232
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,482
Go!

233
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:12,404
You better get your partner
before he kills somebody.

234
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,576
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!

235
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,829
This is for ours, Poncho.

236
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:24,583
Let me through!

237
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:27,878
He didn't do nothing!

238
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,922
What are you looking at?

239
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:34,009
- Tell that Mexican to shut up!
- Move!

240
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:35,427
You're sick!

241
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:38,764
Stens!

242
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,310
- Come on!
- Don't break it up!

243
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,229
Get back! Get back!

244
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,147
Fuck your mother!

245
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:48,357
Fuck you!

246
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,404
Stop! That's an order!

247
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:03,956
You're all in my report!

248
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,394
"Bloody Christmas."

249
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:27,730
The press love to label.

250
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,026
This is bigger than the police board.

251
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:36,447
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.

252
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,073
Will you testify?

253
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:39,325
No, sir.

254
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:43,495
District Attorney Loew?

255
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:48,250
You and Officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.

256
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,377
Stensland was already drunk.

257
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,091
Appearing as a witness against him
could offset the damage to yourself.

258
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,428
I won't testify against him
or anyone else.

259
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,097
This man is a disgrace.

260
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,060
Your badge and gun, officer.
You're suspended from duty.

261
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,562
Dismissed.

262
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,876
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the Department.

263
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:34,296
Justice has to be served.
Of course I'll testify.

264
00:17:37,383 --> 00:17:40,427
I'm glad you feel that way.
Most of the men don't.

265
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:43,305
They think silence and integrity
are the same.

266
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:46,350
Not exactly the image of...

267
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,727
...the new LAPD we're creating.

268
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:51,897
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

269
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:54,775
- May I make a suggestion?
- By all means.

270
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:59,238
The public will expect the Department
to sweep this under the carpet.

271
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:01,156
Don't.

272
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,576
Shift the guilt to men with
secure pensions.

273
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,453
Force them to retire.

274
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:09,832
But somebody has to swing.

275
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:15,129
So indict, try and convict
Richard Stensland and Bud White.

276
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:17,339
Secure them jail time.

277
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,174
The message will be clear.

278
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,680
The new LAPD will not tolerate officers
who think they're above the law.

279
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,684
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.

280
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:32,938
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every C.O. He's ever served under.

281
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,190
But White is a valuable officer.

282
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,026
White's a mindless thug.

283
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:43,198
He's just a man who can say "yes" to the
questions I asked you the other day.

284
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,744
The Department and the public
need role models.

285
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:50,039
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

286
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:52,541
Sergeant...

287
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,793
...I'll promote you...

288
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,545
...to Lieutenant.

289
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:59,840
- Effective immediately.
- Detective Lieutenant.

290
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,677
Ed, you're 30.

291
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:07,473
Your father didn't make lieutenant
until he was 33.

292
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:11,602
I know. I also know when he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

293
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,229
Before we start polishing our laurels...

294
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,024
...it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

295
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,986
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

296
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,821
Jack Vincennes.

297
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,407
He hit one of the Mexicans.

298
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:29,828
A veteran like Vincennes might
admit his own culpability...

299
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:32,539
...but not a fellow officer's.

300
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,085
Jack's the technical advisor
on <i>Badge of Honor.</i>

301
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:37,836
He lives for it.

302
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,755
That's how to get to him.

303
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,427
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

304
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:50,641
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

305
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,851
Bright kid.

306
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,062
You may well reap the benefit...

307
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,107
...but are you prepared to be despised?

308
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,275
Yes, sir, I am.

309
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,278
So be it.

310
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:11,870
Sergeant, we'll get right to it.

311
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:16,500
Nine civilian witnesses identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

312
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,089
But we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back...

313
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,424
...after being hit.

314
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:26,051
You'll testify against 3 officers...

315
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:31,015
...who've already earned their pension,
and plead ignorance about the rest.

316
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,392
No thanks. I'm not a snitch.

317
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:37,062
I'll guarantee a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension...

318
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:40,607
...followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

319
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:43,777
Transfer out of Vice,
you're back on the show.

320
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,742
The show?

321
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:51,952
<i>Badge of Honor.</i>

322
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,415
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

323
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:03,088
I doubt you've ever taken
a stupid breath. Don't start now.

324
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:04,923
Okay, I'll do it.

325
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:10,262
The grand jury hears...

326
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:12,639
...your testimony tomorrow.
Dismissed.

327
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,944
And so it goes...

328
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,197
...Detective Lieutenant.

329
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,409
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow.

330
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:35,454
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace them.

331
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:37,456
And Ed...

332
00:21:37,748 --> 00:21:39,375
...lose the glasses.

333
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:52,513
So you're the stellar witness.

334
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:56,308
I should have known.
What's the Chief throwing you?

335
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:57,601
Throwing me?

336
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,770
What's the payoff?

337
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:03,399
You're the payoff expert.
I'm just doing my duty.

338
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:07,152
Come on. You're playing an
angle here, college boy...

339
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:10,572
...so you don't have to hobnob
with the rank and file...

340
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:12,491
...who'll hate you for snitching.

341
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,452
If they make you detective, watch out.

342
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:20,165
Some Bureau guys'll burn in this and
you'll be working with their friends.

343
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,250
What about you?

344
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:26,255
I'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be
fishing in Oregon next week.

345
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:28,507
Next to you, I'm clean...

346
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:29,925
...and smart.

347
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,720
<i>Edmund J. Exley to chambers.</i>

348
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:35,973
And remember...

349
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:39,893
...Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life.

350
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,274
Captain, what do you want?

351
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:47,609
Call me Dudley.

352
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:49,903
Dudley...

353
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:51,280
...what do you want?

354
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:56,118
Look, lad, I admire
your refusal to testify...

355
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,537
...and your loyalty to your partner.

356
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,748
I admire you as a policeman...

357
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:05,502
...and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

358
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:09,048
And I'm impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

359
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,216
Do you hate them?

360
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,012
What do you want?

361
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:21,018
They're yours.

362
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,145
Take them.

363
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:28,359
There's no bill on me?

364
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,070
- 4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
- Why?

365
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,655
They had a change of heart.

366
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:33,656
And Stensland?

367
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:35,741
Your partner's through.

368
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:38,077
Scapegoat on the Chief's orders.

369
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,245
A year from his pension.

370
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:46,585
- Exley?
- Exley got what he wanted.

371
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:50,214
As a politician he exceeds even myself.

372
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,842
The Department needs
smart men like Exley...

373
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:55,761
...and direct men...

374
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,554
...like you.

375
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:03,018
Look lad, I need you for
an assignment the Chief's given me.

376
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:05,688
A duty few men are fit for...

377
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,439
...but you were born for.

378
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:10,776
You'd be working
out of Homicide at City Hall.

379
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:12,236
Homicide?

380
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:14,697
Working cases?

381
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:18,492
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

382
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,619
It's a muscle job.

383
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,041
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

384
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:28,919
In Technicolor, sir.

385
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,675
<i>"Meet Tony Brancato</i>
<i>and Anthony Trombino...</i>

386
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,387
<i>... two rising lieutenants</i>

387
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:41,515
<i>With the dapper little gent in prison...</i>

388
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:45,019
<i>... who knows how far they'll go?</i>
<i>The sky's the limit.</i>

389
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:52,693
<i>Oh, well. "</i>

390
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:10,294
<i>"Meet Deuce Perkins,</i>
<i>Mickey Cohen 's narcotics lieutenant.</i>

391
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:11,920
<i>Could he be behind the hits?</i>

392
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:15,466
<i>Is he consolidating</i>
<i>organized crime power?</i>

393
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:23,265
<i>I suppose not.</i>

394
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:30,314
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>

395
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:33,776
<i>2- man triggers are punching the tickets</i>
<i>on the Mickster's muscle. "</i>

396
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,997
<i>"Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...</i>

397
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:52,044
<i>... has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon</i>

400
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,679
<i>Off the record, on the Q.T...</i>

401
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:03,597

403
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,771
<i>With Mickey Cohen in prison,</i>
<i>Los Angeles is organized-crime-free.</i>

404
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:12,856
<i>The Chief wants to keep it that way.</i>

405
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:17,194
In Cleveland, you're an
organized crime associate...

406
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:21,198
...in desperate need of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

407
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:25,452
I hear things.

408
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,621
Like those 2-men shooter teams.

409
00:26:27,871 --> 00:26:29,915
They're 86ing Cohen's lieutenants.

410
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,667
What do you want?

411
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:34,294
We want you to go home.

412
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:40,592
Picture-book smut, men.

413
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:44,513
There's been a bunch of this
found at crime scenes lately.

414
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:47,725
Quality ranges from piss-poor...

415
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:49,810
...to very well done.

416
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,813
Look who's back from suspension.

417
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:55,607
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

418
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:59,236
Look at that.
The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.

419
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,780
Is there someplace you'd rather be?

420
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:05,534
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

421
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:09,872
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

422
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:13,208
You should've thought of that
before Bloody Christmas.

423
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:17,963
Make a major case. It's the only way
you'll get out of here.

424
00:27:19,631 --> 00:27:21,008
Dismissed, gentlemen.

425
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:31,185
Go get the facts, Jack.

426
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:33,187
Just the facts.

427
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:42,112
<i>Whatever you desire.</i>

428
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:45,115
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.

429
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:46,408
<i>I don 't know you.</i>

430
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:51,455
A friend just gave me this number
and I wanted to find out if there was...

431
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:56,418
Would you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

432
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,629
Crestview-2239.

433
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:08,222
<i>Hush-Hush, off the record, on the Q.T.</i>

434
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,307
Sid, it's Vincennes.

435
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:13,936
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.

436
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:16,188
I have something going with Vice.

437
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:17,982
Something juicy for the Sidster?

438
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,442
<i>Tracking porn.</i>
<i>Arty, high-class stuff.</i>

439
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:23,737
Know about <i>Fleur-de-Lis</i>?
Slogan's "Whatever you desire."

440
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:25,614
<i>No, I've heard</i> bupkes.

441
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,451
Get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.

442
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:33,580
Shvartze <i>jazz musicians and movie stars.</i>
<i>You like it?</i>

443
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:35,249
I'll talk to you later.

444
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:38,002
- What do you got?
- The number's not assigned.

445
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:39,294
Thanks, Ginger.

446
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:42,464
A bootleg.

447
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:52,766
Take it easy.

448
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:54,476
Tough break, Stens.

449
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:56,812
We're going to miss you.

450
00:28:57,187 --> 00:28:58,731
Raw deal, Stensland.

451
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,902
Here comes the snitch.

452
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:16,707
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.

453
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,517
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

454
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,272
I got some time.
I'll buy you a drink.

455
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:42,566
Rain check. I got a hot date.

456
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,779
Who is she and
what did you arrest her for?

457
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,572
It's confidential.

458
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:53,744
Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. <i>Hush-Hush.</i>

459
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:56,747
I'll see you later in the week.

460
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:59,249
We'll do the town, on me.

461
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,503
Yeah. I'll bring
my wallet just in case.

462
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,051
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on a minute.

463
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:11,345
I'll walk down with you.

464
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:22,564
Punk kid. Who is he
trying to impress?

465
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:24,733
Yeah, I wonder.

466
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,319
Got himself a real career going.

467
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,909
<i>Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.</i>

468
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:36,829
<i>Sergeant Williams?</i>

469
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:42,876
<i>Is there anybody up there in Homicide?</i>

470
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:45,462
<i>Anybody there?</i>

471
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,841
Lieutenant Exley.

472
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:51,093
<i>You've got a homicide downtown.</i>

473
00:30:51,468 --> 00:30:54,221
<i>- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.</i>
- I got it.

474
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:55,556
It's mine.

475
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:09,945
At least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee...

476
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:12,990
No one comes through
the front door. Understand?

477
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:53,173
I want barricades both ends
of the street. Make sure...

478
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:55,551
I took the call. It's my case.

479
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,303
You don't want it and you can't have it.

480
00:32:58,679 --> 00:32:59,555
I took the call.

481
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,931
It's mine.

482
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:03,892
I'll make you my second-in-command.

483
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:05,894
Captain, over here, please.

484
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:14,570
The cook drew a gun and set it off.
The rest died in the men's room.

485
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:24,121
We got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

486
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:28,500
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

487
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:31,712
Excuse me, we got an I.D.
on one of the victims.

488
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:33,589
It's Dick Stensland.

489
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,802
At first, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

490
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:40,512
Yeah, me too.

491
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:52,316
Hell of a way to avoid prison.

492
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:04,286
What happened?

493
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:07,331
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.

494
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:10,501
The guy at the register pulled a.38,
so they killed him.

495
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,711
Then they killed everyone else.

496
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:18,676
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl I.D.

497
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:26,141
Is this your daughter?

498
00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:28,560
I don't know.

499
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:31,939
We know this is difficult.
Take your time.

500
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:35,943
It seems like my Susan.

501
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:39,071
But my Susan was a blonde,
not a redhead.

502
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,198
When was the last time you saw her?

503
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:43,659
Just before Christmas.

504
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:47,204
We'd fought.
I didn't like her boyfriend.

505
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,914
Mrs. Lefferts...

506
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:51,667
...does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks?

507
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:55,671
<i>You got the wrong idea, mister.</i>
<i>I'm fine.</i>

508
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:59,675
She has a birthmark on her hip.

509
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,057
It's her.

510
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,893
My baby.

511
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,898
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

512
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,485
Who's in charge of this investigation?

513
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,446
Captain Smith and myself. Why?

514
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:24,450
<i>"The Nite Owl Massacre."</i>

515
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:26,452
Hyperbole aside...

516
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:30,331
...this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.

517
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:32,291
Six victims.

518
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,252
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

519
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:39,757
He was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

520
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:42,092
Robbery is the likely motive.

521
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:46,847
We have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics...

522
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:50,809
...tend toward a trio of shooters.
We do have one hot lead.

523
00:35:51,393 --> 00:35:53,187
Three Negro juveniles...

524
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:56,982
...were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

525
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:01,320
A park ranger I.D.'d them as driving
a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe...

526
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:02,863
...maroon in color.

527
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,034
An hour ago a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor...

528
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:10,954
...who saw a maroon Merc coupe
parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a.m.

529
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:15,209
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

530
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:20,964
48 two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

531
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:24,218
Interrogations will be led by
Lt. Edmund Exley.

532
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,098
Enough on that!

533
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:35,980
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

534
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:39,441
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

535
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,235
Dismissed.

536
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,657
Why not just put a bounty on them?

537
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:57,126
- Ready to roll?
- You take them. I got something to do.

538
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,253
What if one of these names...?

539
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:01,005
Get somebody else.

540
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,049
I got our assignments, Big V.

541
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:07,302
If we go by this list,
we'll never make this collar.

542
00:37:07,678 --> 00:37:11,682
I got a guy who knows what happens
south of Jefferson. He'll put us at 50-50.

543
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,645
What are you doing? That's the same
thing that got you in trouble before.

544
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:18,272
I'll take those odds.

545
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:23,861
We got it from here.

546
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,574
You should bring along
a photographer.

547
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:36,999
I need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

548
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:39,084
- That's all I got to go on?
- Yeah.

549
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:41,837
You already know who I mean,
so cough it up.

550
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:45,424
<i>There's a billing address</i>
<i>and a delivery address.</i>

551
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,869
Are you Pierce Patchett?

552
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,246
I am.

553
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:22,378
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.

554
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,714
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

555
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,268
What can I do for you?

556
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:42,898
- Where were you last night?
- I was here hosting a party.

557
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,318
Tell me about Dick Stensland.

558
00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:48,737
I don't know him, Mr...?

559
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,447
Officer White.

560
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,783
You know Sue Lefferts?

561
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,452
You know I do.
You saw me with her.

562
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:58,789
How did you find me?

563
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:03,585
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

564
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:05,421
Of course.

565
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:10,467
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

566
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,761
I'm investigating.

567
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:16,473
Everything all right?

568
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,809
Fine, Phillip, thank you.

569
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:25,482
What happened to the other guy?
Buzz.

570
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:28,110
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

571
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:30,821
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn't act it. Why?

572
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:35,284
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is... was...

573
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:36,827
...a big doubles fan.

574
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:40,664
You're a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.

575
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:45,794
- Want to go downtown to discuss it?
- Is this official?

576
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:51,175
Somehow I have the feeling
this is more personal with you.

577
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:55,971
All right, then...

578
00:39:56,972 --> 00:40:01,226
...are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders?

579
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:04,855
- Not at the moment.
- So you're not obligated to report them.

580
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:09,401
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

581
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,488
I needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.

582
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:13,822
What little studio?

583
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:17,701
Well, there's Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner...

584
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:20,204
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

585
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:23,165
I use girls that look like movie stars.

586
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,001
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.

587
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:29,046
When the work was done,
that's when you saw us.

588
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,674
It's why her mom couldn't I.D. her.

589
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,718
Jesus fucking Christ.

590
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:36,887
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.

591
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:42,768
I sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all I'm saying.

592
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,229
If you persist,
we'll meet with my attorney.

593
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,524
Would you like Lynn Bracken's address?

594
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:50,401
I got her address.

595
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,737
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

596
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,407
I'll give you a handsome reward.

597
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:02,663
Whatever you desire!

598
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,923
<i>I know you're not asleep.</i>

599
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:17,219
<i>What do you want?</i>

600
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,096
<i>My 5 bucks.</i>

601
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:21,682
<i>It was the only one I had.</i>

602
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:23,058
Right now?

603
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:26,020
Hey, dollface,
tell him to leave us alone.

604
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:28,564
I understand.
Okay, fine.

605
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:31,233
Oh, baby...

606
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:33,902
...bad news.

607
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:35,237
You have to go.

608
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:36,613
Go?

609
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:40,409
Something very important has come up
and you have to go.

610
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:42,494
I'll make it up to you.

611
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,247
I will, I promise.
Excuse me.

612
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,293
Is it the cops?

613
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:55,049
Miss Bracken...

614
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:56,258
...I'm Officer White.

615
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:59,094
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

616
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,930
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.

617
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:05,267
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

618
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:06,518
Hit the road.

619
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:10,481
Maybe I will...

620
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:12,483
...maybe I won't.

621
00:42:12,941 --> 00:42:16,445
LAPD, shitbird. Get out or
I'll have your wife come get you.

622
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,588
- Officer.
- Councilman.

623
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:56,694
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.

624
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:06,161
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

625
00:43:06,662 --> 00:43:07,830
Know what I mean?

626
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,915
You sorry she's dead?

627
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,210
Of course I am.

628
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,379
What kind of question is that?

629
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:19,800
You know why Pierce
is humoring you?

630
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:22,428
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

631
00:43:22,845 --> 00:43:23,846
But do you know?

632
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:25,347
Yeah, I know.

633
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:28,183
Patchett's running whores...

634
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:31,478
...cut to look like movie stars.

635
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:35,107
And judging by his address,
something bigger on the side.

636
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,234
He doesn't want any attention.

637
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:41,071
That's right. Our motives are selfish
so we're cooperating.

638
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,199
So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

639
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,161
I don't know. I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

640
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:48,370
How'd she meet Patchett?

641
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:50,247
Pierce meets people.

642
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:54,418
Sue had dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

643
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:58,714
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

644
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:01,592
Tell me about Pierce.

645
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:04,011
He's waiting for you to mention money.

646
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:08,390
- Want some advice, Miss Bracken?
- It's Lynn.

647
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,059
Miss Bracken...

648
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,395
...don't ever try to fucking bribe me...

649
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:16,065
...or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

650
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:19,610
I remember you from Christmas Eve.

651
00:44:20,903 --> 00:44:23,989
You have a thing
for helping women, don't you?

652
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:26,575
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

653
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:30,245
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.

654
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:34,083
There's blood on your shirt.
Is that an integral part of your job?

655
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,959
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it?

656
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:37,169
When they deserve it.

657
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:38,921
Did they deserve it today?

658
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:41,590
I'm not sure.

659
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,300
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.

660
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:46,303
Like the half dozen guys
you screwed today.

661
00:44:47,763 --> 00:44:49,682
Actually, it was only two.

662
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,019
You're different, Officer White.

663
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:58,774
You're the first man in years who didn't
tell me I look like Veronica Lake.

664
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:00,776
You look better than Veronica Lake.

665
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,366
Pierce Patchett?

666
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:11,829
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

667
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:15,165
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

668
00:45:15,624 --> 00:45:19,378
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

669
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,757
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.

670
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:25,009
No.

671
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:28,554
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

672
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:32,975
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

673
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,186
It's nice meeting you.

674
00:45:40,983 --> 00:45:43,193
- I'd like to see you again.
- For a date...

675
00:45:43,485 --> 00:45:44,653
...or an appointment?

676
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,781
I don't know.

677
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,744
- If it's a date, what's your first name?
- Forget I asked.

678
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,371
It was a mistake.

679
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:16,393
Leonard Bidwell?

680
00:46:17,645 --> 00:46:19,521
Come down here and talk to us.

681
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,858
How's the left these days?

682
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:24,443
What's it to you?

683
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,362
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.

684
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:28,364
I like your style.

685
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,743
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

686
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:36,038
You got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.

687
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:37,289
Until 1970.

688
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:39,583
How'd you like to make it 1960?

689
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,211
I know the judge,
and Lieutenant Exley...

690
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:44,630
...is good friends with the D.A.

691
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:50,594
We're looking for 3 colored guys
who like to pop off shotguns.

692
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:52,930
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

693
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:56,392
- Want me to snitch?
- Want to buy your brother 10 years?

694
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,477
- It was 10 years?
- 10 years.

695
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:01,939
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

696
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:03,774
...and point.

697
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:08,112
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

698
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:09,905
Sugar Ray Collins.

699
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,408
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

700
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,618
Beautiful ride.

701
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,456
Don't know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.

702
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:21,083
He's righteous trash.

703
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:24,628
Look at that. It's five minutes
from here. Thanks.

704
00:47:26,922 --> 00:47:28,298
I'll hear from you...

705
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:30,718
...about my brother?

706
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,262
Keep it up, Lenny. Up.

707
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,520
There it is.
It's in the back.

708
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:01,457
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here.

709
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:08,797
Damn it.

710
00:48:09,465 --> 00:48:10,716
My glasses.

711
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:12,176
You're kidding.

712
00:48:13,802 --> 00:48:15,679
Just don't shoot me.

713
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:26,315
What are you doing here?

714
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:29,026
We were in the neighborhood.

715
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:32,863
- What do you got?
- Three 12-gauge pumps.

716
00:48:33,155 --> 00:48:33,864
And cash.

717
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:38,786
So long, Vice.
<i>Badge of Honor,</i> here I come.

718
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:40,829
Fuck you! This is our collar.

719
00:48:41,205 --> 00:48:42,206
Quiet!

720
00:48:42,581 --> 00:48:46,001
I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.

721
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:52,383
Right.

722
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:54,843
How many ways in?

723
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,346
Only one. Up the stairs.

724
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:00,724
He's very serious.

725
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:16,240
Police!

726
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,491
Don't shoot!

727
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:21,578
- Don't move.
- Shut up!

728
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:22,997
Anxious, aren't you?

729
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:24,373
Don't kill them.

730
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:28,168
Back, back, back!

731
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:30,713
Get off me!

732
00:49:32,047 --> 00:49:33,424
Against the wall!

733
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:35,467
- Put your hands up!
- Get over there.

734
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,387
Shut up!
Hands behind your back!

735
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:40,639
So...

736
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,892
...how's it feel
getting out of the office?

737
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:51,567
This came from forensics.

738
00:49:51,942 --> 00:49:53,319
"Burning clothes...

739
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:56,572
...Casitas Youth Camp..."

740
00:50:00,117 --> 00:50:01,827
It's crowded in here, White.

741
00:50:02,494 --> 00:50:04,204
These guys killed Stensland.

742
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:23,641
The ejection marks on the shells
fired from the shotguns...

743
00:50:24,016 --> 00:50:26,977
...are identical to those on the
shell casings found at the Nite Owl.

744
00:50:27,436 --> 00:50:29,271
I want confessions, Edmund.

745
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,732
A night's stewing
has softened them up.

746
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:34,485
I'll break them, sir.

747
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:57,716
Are you sure golden boy
is up to the task, Cap?

748
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:01,345
I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

749
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:05,724
You're 22, aren't you, Ray?

750
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,982
Did an officer work you over?

751
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:18,112
- You're 22, right?
- Why do you keep asking that?

752
00:51:18,487 --> 00:51:20,823
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.

753
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:23,534
You should've pulled this 2 years ago.

754
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:27,079
Get life, do a little
Youth Authority jolt...

755
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:29,081
...transfer to Folsom a big man.

756
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:31,291
Get yourself a sissy.

757
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:33,544
I don't truck with sissies.

758
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:37,548
Louis.

759
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,258
What?

760
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:43,470
You did the Casitas
Youth Camp with Louis.

761
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:47,516
Why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

762
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:51,103
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.

763
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,441
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.

764
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:57,359
Said they called you Sugar...

765
00:51:57,943 --> 00:52:00,154
...because you gave it out so sweet.

766
00:52:01,238 --> 00:52:05,284
<i>Louis gave it up at Casitas.</i>
<i>I was the boss jock in my dorm!</i>

767
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:06,535
He was the sissy!

768
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:10,914
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
He ain't got the sense of a dog!

769
00:52:12,124 --> 00:52:13,542
You like to shoot dogs.

770
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,045
Dogs got no reason to live.

771
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:19,506
What about people?

772
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:21,467
What you trying to say?

773
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:23,302
We got the shotguns.

774
00:52:23,677 --> 00:52:25,054
I don't own shotguns.

775
00:52:25,304 --> 00:52:27,640
Why were you throwing clothes
in the incinerator?

776
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:28,891
Say what?

777
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:33,812
A neighbor said she saw you
throwing clothes in the incinerator.

778
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:35,189
Doesn't look good.

779
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:37,608
I ain't talking till I see a judge.

780
00:52:37,983 --> 00:52:41,320
Were you on hop? You were
passed out when we arrested you.

781
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:44,073
Ty and Louis fuck
with that shit, not me.

782
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,075
Where do they get their stuff?

783
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:48,535
Come on.

784
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,206
Give me one to feed the D.A.
It'll make me look good...

785
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:56,085
...and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk
like his sissy partners.

786
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:05,094
Tell me where Jones and Fontaine...

787
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,804
...get their drugs.

788
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,266
Roland Navarette.

789
00:53:13,686 --> 00:53:15,479
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

790
00:53:15,854 --> 00:53:17,773
And he sells red devils.

791
00:53:18,691 --> 00:53:20,192
Exley's good, I'll give him that.

792
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:21,485
I'll take a break.

793
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:28,450
You know, I'm talking
about the gas chamber...

794
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:31,870
...and you haven't asked me
what this is about.

795
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:35,249
You got a big "guilty" sign
around your neck.

796
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:41,755
That was masterful.

797
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:43,257
He's ready to go.

798
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:53,642
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.

799
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:56,312
Take the cuffs off so he can read it.

800
00:53:56,812 --> 00:54:00,399
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

801
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:04,987
I think it was Ray's idea.
You talk, I think I can save your life.

802
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:08,657
6 people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.

803
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:11,869
Now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.

804
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:15,873
Louis, he called you queer.

805
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,044
- He said you took it up the ass.
- I didn't kill nobody!

806
00:54:22,504 --> 00:54:23,505
Son...

807
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:27,926
...you know what'll happen
if you don't talk.

808
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:31,096
You'll go to the gas chamber.
So admit what you did.

809
00:54:32,348 --> 00:54:33,932
I didn't mean to hurt her.

810
00:54:34,308 --> 00:54:37,061
- Maybe she's okay.
- Okay?

811
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:41,607
They're in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

812
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,403
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.

813
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,198
She don't die, so I don't die.

814
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:52,076
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

815
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:54,286
Who are you talking about?

816
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:56,664
Was she at the Nite Owl?

817
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,625
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?

818
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:09,385
- This newspaper ain't shit!
- Where's the girl?

819
00:55:09,718 --> 00:55:10,469
You kill her?

820
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,891
Louis lost his cherry, but things
got out of hand. You made her bleed.

821
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:18,394
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

822
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:19,561
Who said that?!

823
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:22,356
Now, listen to me.

824
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:25,192
If she's alive, she's your
only chance.

825
00:55:25,442 --> 00:55:26,610
I think she's alive.

826
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:28,487
Where is she now?

827
00:55:28,904 --> 00:55:30,614
You leave her someplace?

828
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:33,701
Tell me where she is!

829
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:37,454
What're you doing?!

830
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:38,872
Don't.

831
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,958
White!

832
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,253
1 in 6! Where's the girl?

833
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:46,005
I have this under control!

834
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:47,631
Where's the girl?

835
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:59,310
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

836
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:02,604
...brown corner house, upstairs.

837
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:17,369
- Just give me one minute.
- You got it.

838
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:24,960
<i>Nobody moves.</i>

839
00:56:25,544 --> 00:56:27,504
We're going in the front.
Stay put...

840
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,214
<i>... until I give the word.</i>

841
00:58:54,777 --> 00:58:56,487
He went around back!

842
00:58:58,072 --> 00:59:02,159
I'm Lieutenant Exley. I'm sorry,
I need to know what time they left.

843
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:04,703
Get her to the hospital.
Excuse me.

844
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:06,705
Give your career a rest.

845
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:08,332
Leave her alone.

846
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:11,377
A naked guy with a gun?
Who'll believe that?

847
00:59:11,627 --> 00:59:13,337
Get the fuck away from me.

848
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:18,342
- How will that look in your report?
- Like justice. That's what the man got.

849
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:21,804
- Justice.
- You don't know the meaning of the word.

850
00:59:22,638 --> 00:59:25,849
You think it means getting
your picture in the paper.

851
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,310
Go after criminals for a change.

852
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,688
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.

853
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:47,663
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

854
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,415
His blood's always up.

855
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,002
Perhaps you should
avoid him altogether.

856
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:57,089
<i>Raymond Collins, Ty Jones</i>
<i>and Louis Fontaine.</i>

857
00:59:57,464 --> 01:00:00,009
<i>They are considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

858
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:02,970
<i>Repeat. The Nite Owl</i>
<i>suspects have escaped.</i>

859
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:05,347
How'd they get out the window?

860
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:07,433
They jumped from the 2nd floor.

861
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:11,812
Girl said they left her at 12.
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.

862
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:16,233
The question was,
where did they get their drugs?

863
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:18,444
I haven't gotten that far yet.

864
01:00:18,861 --> 01:00:22,364
"Roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill.
He runs a hole-up..."

865
01:00:24,742 --> 01:00:26,076
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

866
01:00:28,203 --> 01:00:29,621
Is something up?

867
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:31,749
I need backup. Come on.

868
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:51,226
- What?
- Nothing. Let's go.

869
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,111
This should be it.

870
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:06,700
404.

871
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:29,431
Nobody moves!

872
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:31,642
Stay right there!

873
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:33,769
- You're under arrest.
- Don't shoot!

874
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:35,562
Please don't shoot!

875
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:36,897
Don't move!

876
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:29,658
<i>There he is.</i>

877
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:32,119
You did good, kid.

878
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:35,622
You should've seen this place.
Blood everywhere.

879
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,667
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

880
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:41,170
Somebody get him cleaned up.

881
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:42,421
Come on.

882
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:49,595
<i>Edmund J. Exley</i>
<i>has amassed a brilliant record...</i>

883
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:52,306
...in his 7 years with the
Los Angeles Police Department.

884
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:55,601
Recently, he evinced
spectacular bravery in the line of duty.

885
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:58,687
It is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:

886
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:00,689
The Medal of Valor.

887
01:03:01,065 --> 01:03:03,192
- What kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.

888
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:06,153
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.

889
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:09,573
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?

890
01:03:09,948 --> 01:03:13,619
Light. And that's really
all I remember, Officer.

891
01:03:14,662 --> 01:03:16,538
Thank you.
You've been a big help.

892
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:18,707
Cut!
That's a print.

893
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,417
Big Jack!

894
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:22,002
He's back!

895
01:03:22,378 --> 01:03:24,213
Jack's back.

896
01:03:57,454 --> 01:04:00,958
Tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention
of changing my vote.

897
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:17,349
It may surprise some that an official
would admit to making a mistake...

898
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:20,602
...but after due consideration...

899
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:24,440
...I am changing my position
on the matter before the council.

900
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,528
"Go west, America"
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.

901
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:33,449
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs...

902
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:35,993
...no traffic signals, from downtown...

903
01:04:36,368 --> 01:04:38,329
...to the beach in 20 minutes.

904
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:11,403
What were you going to start with?

905
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:14,948
Prostitution?

906
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:17,951
Gambling?

907
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:25,501
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...

908
01:05:25,793 --> 01:05:27,878
...and you haven't got any wings.

909
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:53,028
Nice to see you again.
Take care.

910
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:33,652
I wondered when you'd
knock on my door again, Officer White.

911
01:06:34,403 --> 01:06:35,404
It's Bud.

912
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:38,115
Bud.

913
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:08,687
Why me?

914
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:11,940
I don't know.

915
01:07:48,686 --> 01:07:49,770
This election...

916
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:53,273
...is about the future of
law enforcement in Los Angeles.

917
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,610
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

918
01:07:57,027 --> 01:07:58,612
So let's dig deep...

919
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:02,574
...and get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.

920
01:08:06,787 --> 01:08:09,748
Thank you, Brett Chase.
The talented star of <i>Badge of Honor.</i>

921
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:14,795
Let me tell you,
I am so thrilled to be here.

922
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:17,589
Big V.

923
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,593
Good to see you back.

924
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:24,596
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.

925
01:08:24,972 --> 01:08:26,724
You tight with the D.A., Jackie?

926
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:30,436
He tried to throw me
off the force last Christmas.

927
01:08:30,811 --> 01:08:32,271
How about some payback, big-time?

928
01:08:32,646 --> 01:08:37,234
Plus the usual $50 donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

929
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,863
- Did you know the D.A. Was a swish?
- No kidding?

930
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:46,577
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?

931
01:08:46,952 --> 01:08:49,413
- He just got off the honor farm.
- What's he doing here?

932
01:08:50,414 --> 01:08:52,791
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

933
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:55,377
I'm getting him
to fuck the D.A. For $ 100.

934
01:08:55,753 --> 01:08:58,547
That's twice the $50
you got for wrecking his career.

935
01:09:00,341 --> 01:09:02,801
- Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him...

936
01:09:07,848 --> 01:09:09,433
That's D.A. Loew right there.

937
01:09:14,813 --> 01:09:15,981
You need a drink?

938
01:09:16,982 --> 01:09:17,900
Yeah.

939
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:20,110
Look after him.

940
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:24,198
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.

941
01:09:29,662 --> 01:09:31,914
- How you doing?
- I'm okay. How're you?

942
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:33,290
I'm good.

943
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,212
Have we met before?

944
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:41,632
Yeah.

945
01:09:42,925 --> 01:09:44,093
Was it at a party?

946
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:46,261
It was something like that.

947
01:09:47,972 --> 01:09:49,515
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

948
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:51,892
Right.

949
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:54,103
Fleur-de-Lis.

950
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,689
"Whatever you desire."

951
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:59,608
Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars...

952
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,944
...Pierce Patchett has it all.

953
01:10:03,028 --> 01:10:04,738
You could say that again.

954
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:07,491
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.

955
01:10:09,326 --> 01:10:10,494
I dig him...

956
01:10:12,204 --> 01:10:13,038
...but you know...

957
01:10:14,289 --> 01:10:15,624
...he scares me too.

958
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,501
Really?

959
01:10:18,168 --> 01:10:19,044
How?

960
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:24,967
When I came out to L.A. This isn't
exactly where I saw myself ending up.

961
01:10:26,427 --> 01:10:27,511
Yeah, well...

962
01:10:27,886 --> 01:10:28,971
...get in line.

963
01:10:29,596 --> 01:10:31,557
Dutch courage, kid. Drink up.

964
01:10:36,562 --> 01:10:38,647
I don't think I should do this.

965
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:41,317
It's not like you don't know how.

966
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:46,071
Jack's connected to <i>Badge of Honor.</i>
Pull this off, you'll get a part.

967
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:49,199
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?

968
01:10:51,952 --> 01:10:53,037
The D.A.'s free.

969
01:10:53,454 --> 01:10:55,914
Go introduce yourself. Go on.

970
01:10:56,415 --> 01:10:58,959
Tell him about the opening on the show.

971
01:11:00,252 --> 01:11:02,421
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part.

972
01:11:04,256 --> 01:11:09,386
But that's later on. Tonight, just
go over and pretend it's an acting job.

973
01:11:09,762 --> 01:11:11,013
Like show biz.

974
01:11:11,388 --> 01:11:12,473
Acting, that's it.

975
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:13,599
Right.

976
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:15,559
No one's going to know about this?

977
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:16,560
No.

978
01:11:18,937 --> 01:11:20,439
It'll be our secret.

979
01:11:25,235 --> 01:11:27,613
- Show biz.
- That's it. Go on.

980
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:32,868
Show biz.

981
01:11:34,953 --> 01:11:37,206
If Reynolds works his charms,
and he will...

982
01:11:37,456 --> 01:11:40,250
...they'll be at the Hollywood
Center Motel, room 203.

983
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:42,586
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

984
01:11:43,754 --> 01:11:46,799
Maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.

985
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:49,802
You know Pierce Patchett?

986
01:11:51,637 --> 01:11:53,180
I know what you know.

987
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:57,810
He's rich. Invested in the freeways,
which'll make him richer. Why?

988
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:01,146
I keep hearing rumors.

989
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:04,775
High-class porn, drugs, hookers
that look like movie stars.

990
01:12:05,901 --> 01:12:09,113
Patchett's what I call twilight.
He ain't queer or red.

991
01:12:09,613 --> 01:12:13,283
He cannot help me in my quest
for prime <i>sinnuendo.</i>

992
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:23,002
As though <i>Badge of Honor</i> would
touch that guy with a 10-foot pole...

993
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:26,422
...after he's been <i>Hush-Hush</i>
cover boy twice in one year.

994
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:27,798
See you soon.

995
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:32,094
Midnight. I guarantee all kinds
of illegal activity.

996
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:06,545
Another, Jack?

997
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:53,008
Kid?

998
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:03,477
Come on, you don't have to do this...

999
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:37,594
Thank you for what you did for me...

1000
01:14:37,928 --> 01:14:40,472
...for killing those animals
who raped me.

1001
01:14:40,889 --> 01:14:43,642
Will you thank Officer White
for me, please?

1002
01:14:43,892 --> 01:14:44,893
Sure.

1003
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:50,399
Seeing him come through the door
is about the only thing I remember.

1004
01:14:50,649 --> 01:14:51,650
Thank God.

1005
01:14:52,776 --> 01:14:55,696
You remember what time
the Negroes left you?

1006
01:14:55,946 --> 01:14:59,074
In your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

1007
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:00,409
They might have.

1008
01:15:05,956 --> 01:15:07,291
They "might" have?

1009
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:11,086
I don't know what time they left me.
I wanted them dead.

1010
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:14,923
Would anyone care that they
raped a Mexican girl...

1011
01:15:15,257 --> 01:15:18,177
...if they hadn't killed those
white people at the Nite Owl?

1012
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:21,513
I did what I had to do for justice.

1013
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:23,682
Exley, over here.

1014
01:15:23,974 --> 01:15:24,975
Smile, Inez.

1015
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:28,479
Is he your hero?

1016
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:33,484
Fellas, how about this? "Rape Victim
Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero."

1017
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:41,367
All they get is Veronica Lake.

1018
01:15:43,702 --> 01:15:45,913
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

1019
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:58,133
"Bisbee"?

1020
01:16:00,511 --> 01:16:01,929
I grew up there.

1021
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:08,519
I'm going back in a couple of years,
open up a dress shop.

1022
01:16:10,646 --> 01:16:13,732
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

1023
01:16:19,405 --> 01:16:20,906
Where'd this come from?

1024
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:26,578
I was 12. My dad went after my mother
with a bottle. I got in the way.

1025
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:30,207
So you saved her.

1026
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,918
Not for long.

1027
01:16:36,171 --> 01:16:39,300
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- He tied me to the radiator.

1028
01:16:40,217 --> 01:16:43,304
I watched him beat my mother to death
with a tire iron...

1029
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:47,266
...and he left me there.

1030
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:52,771
Three days before
a truant officer found us.

1031
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:57,818
They never found the old man.

1032
01:17:07,286 --> 01:17:09,163
Is that why you became a cop?

1033
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:11,290
To get even?

1034
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,043
Maybe.

1035
01:17:16,086 --> 01:17:17,463
Do you like it?

1036
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:22,134
I used to.

1037
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:27,014
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting duck stuff.

1038
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:34,563
If I could get a chance to work
Homicide like a real detective...

1039
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:39,610
That prick, Exley.
He shot the wrong guys.

1040
01:17:40,277 --> 01:17:44,823
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.

1041
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:47,368
Something's wrong
with the Nite Owl.

1042
01:17:47,785 --> 01:17:49,828
I just can't prove it, that's all.

1043
01:17:51,163 --> 01:17:52,998
I'm not smart enough.

1044
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:58,295
I'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

1045
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:02,967
You're wrong.

1046
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:06,303
You found Patchett. You found me.

1047
01:18:06,845 --> 01:18:08,555
You're smart enough.

1048
01:18:20,317 --> 01:18:23,362
Bud White. What brings you
down to the basement?

1049
01:18:27,157 --> 01:18:29,076
A couple of Nite Owl questions.

1050
01:18:29,326 --> 01:18:32,413
Don't know if you read the papers,
but that case is closed.

1051
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:36,250
Anything bother you about it?

1052
01:18:37,001 --> 01:18:40,671
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't
hauled this shit out of here yet.

1053
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:49,388
The suspects' 3 shotguns match
the strike marks on the shell casings.

1054
01:18:50,514 --> 01:18:52,182
What more do you want?

1055
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:05,904
There's blood on the wall here.

1056
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,991
I thought everyone got shot
in the men's room.

1057
01:19:09,241 --> 01:19:11,535
That is Stensland's blood.

1058
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:17,541
Blow to the head. Probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.

1059
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:20,544
They hit anyone else?

1060
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:24,006
No, but he was a cop.
Probably tried to do something.

1061
01:19:27,926 --> 01:19:31,472
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone was sitting next to him.

1062
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:37,311
2 of the victims were women?

1063
01:19:37,603 --> 01:19:41,440
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

1064
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:47,946
Susan Lefferts.

1065
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:51,075
What about her?

1066
01:19:54,286 --> 01:19:55,537
You're welcome!

1067
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,878
Mrs. Lefferts?

1068
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:05,089
I'm Officer White, LAPD.

1069
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:11,345
Tell me about the boyfriend.
The one you mentioned at the coroner's.

1070
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:13,889
Susie, I told you
I didn't approve.

1071
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:18,852
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.

1072
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:23,023
They came here one day
when I wasn't home.

1073
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:25,275
Mrs. Jensen next door said...

1074
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:29,071
...she saw Susie's boyfriend
and another man...

1075
01:20:29,446 --> 01:20:31,115
...and she heard a ruckus.

1076
01:20:31,907 --> 01:20:32,992
What was his name?

1077
01:20:33,283 --> 01:20:35,828
We weren't properly introduced.

1078
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:38,747
He had a nickname, Muns or Luns.

1079
01:20:39,123 --> 01:20:41,583
Stens? Was it Stens?

1080
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:42,918
Maybe.

1081
01:20:43,294 --> 01:20:45,296
- I don't know.
- Look at this picture.

1082
01:20:49,133 --> 01:20:50,217
That's him.

1083
01:20:50,634 --> 01:20:51,635
That's him.

1084
01:20:57,016 --> 01:20:59,351
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.

1085
01:20:59,935 --> 01:21:00,853
Outside?

1086
01:21:01,103 --> 01:21:02,021
Inside?

1087
01:21:03,314 --> 01:21:04,481
Outside.

1088
01:21:04,857 --> 01:21:08,694
And then Mrs. Jensen said
they kept going under the house.

1089
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:15,200
You have to leave now, Officer.

1090
01:21:16,535 --> 01:21:19,913
- What's through here?
- Just a room full of old things.

1091
01:21:20,164 --> 01:21:21,999
Don't move that.

1092
01:21:24,501 --> 01:21:28,088
Don't mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.

1093
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:30,883
My Susie was a good girl.

1094
01:21:31,634 --> 01:21:34,678
She was never in any
kind of trouble at all.

1095
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:48,294
<i>"Leland Meeks."</i>
<i>Never heard of you.</i>

1096
01:22:48,711 --> 01:22:50,170
<i>They call me Buzz.</i>

1097
01:22:57,261 --> 01:22:58,429
Was it a rat?

1098
01:22:59,388 --> 01:23:01,140
Yeah, a great big one.

1099
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:04,560
Here.

1100
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:07,479
Compliments of the Police Department.

1101
01:23:24,621 --> 01:23:27,416
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

1102
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:31,253
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.

1103
01:23:31,503 --> 01:23:33,881
Hell of a last supper,
don't you think?

1104
01:23:34,131 --> 01:23:37,051
Anything bothering you
about the Nite Owl case?

1105
01:23:37,593 --> 01:23:39,553
The fact that you guys
won't let it go.

1106
01:23:40,763 --> 01:23:44,350
- What do you mean?
- Bud White grilled me on it today.

1107
01:23:45,517 --> 01:23:46,602
Bud White?

1108
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:49,313
He's not as dumb as I thought.

1109
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:54,318
Did he say where he was going?

1110
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:08,624
Let my daughter rest in peace!

1111
01:24:08,874 --> 01:24:11,001
I just want to ask a few questions.

1112
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,629
Officer White already checked
under the house.

1113
01:24:14,213 --> 01:24:15,297
Under the house?

1114
01:24:16,048 --> 01:24:18,258
- Where?
- Out back.

1115
01:24:19,843 --> 01:24:21,428
All he found was rodents.

1116
01:24:24,807 --> 01:24:28,727
I need an I.D. on this as soon as
possible. Talk only to me on this one.

1117
01:24:32,731 --> 01:24:33,649
I need your help.

1118
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:37,319
I'm busy. Why don't you ask
your boys in Homicide?

1119
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,950
I can't. I need someone
outside of Homicide.

1120
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:46,412
I want you to tail Bud White.

1121
01:24:47,913 --> 01:24:50,082
Do me a favor. Leave me alone.

1122
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:53,585
You make the 3 Negroes
for the Nite Owl killings?

1123
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:57,756
What?

1124
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,425
It's a simple question.

1125
01:25:01,635 --> 01:25:04,346
Why in the world
do you want to dig deeper...

1126
01:25:04,722 --> 01:25:06,515
...into the Nite Owl killings...

1127
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:07,975
...Lieutenant?

1128
01:25:11,854 --> 01:25:13,230
Rollo Tomasi.

1129
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:17,443
Is there more or do I have to guess?

1130
01:25:20,612 --> 01:25:22,656
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1131
01:25:27,202 --> 01:25:29,163
My father ran into him off-duty.

1132
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:34,251
He shot my father 6 times
and got away clean.

1133
01:25:35,878 --> 01:25:37,504
No one knew who he was.

1134
01:25:38,505 --> 01:25:40,549
I made the name up
to give him personality.

1135
01:25:42,426 --> 01:25:43,427
Your point?

1136
01:25:44,136 --> 01:25:46,764
Rollo Tomasi's the reason
I became a cop.

1137
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:51,060
I wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could get away with it.

1138
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:54,396
It was about justice.

1139
01:25:55,397 --> 01:25:58,275
Then somewhere along the way
I lost sight of that.

1140
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:03,781
Why'd you become a cop?

1141
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,043
I don't remember.

1142
01:26:22,883 --> 01:26:24,051
What do you want?

1143
01:26:24,843 --> 01:26:26,387
I want to solve this.

1144
01:26:27,137 --> 01:26:28,722
Nite Owl was solved.

1145
01:26:31,684 --> 01:26:32,851
I want to do it right.

1146
01:26:33,686 --> 01:26:35,896
Even if it means
paying the consequences?

1147
01:26:39,566 --> 01:26:41,276
All right, college boy, I'll help.

1148
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:44,446
But there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.

1149
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:48,575
They think it's just another
Hollywood "homo"-cide. But I don't.

1150
01:26:49,618 --> 01:26:52,746
You help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.

1151
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,164
Deal?

1152
01:26:55,332 --> 01:26:56,125
Deal.

1153
01:27:28,657 --> 01:27:30,617
Johnny Stompanato.

1154
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,621
Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, <i>paesano?</i>

1155
01:27:34,997 --> 01:27:36,498
I ain't your <i>paesano.</i>

1156
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,460
I ain't in the snitch business anymore.

1157
01:27:39,793 --> 01:27:41,837
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1158
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:44,757
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1159
01:27:45,466 --> 01:27:46,550
Should I?

1160
01:27:48,052 --> 01:27:50,763
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

1161
01:27:51,138 --> 01:27:52,306
You tell me.

1162
01:27:54,391 --> 01:27:56,185
Yeah, I remember now.

1163
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,022
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
Same as you'll be some day.

1164
01:28:00,397 --> 01:28:01,857
That's all you'll get.

1165
01:28:02,733 --> 01:28:04,443
Keep your $20.

1166
01:28:10,074 --> 01:28:13,494
What do I get if I give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?

1167
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:20,042
There was a rumor going around...

1168
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:23,420
...that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

1169
01:28:25,589 --> 01:28:26,423
And?

1170
01:28:27,257 --> 01:28:28,509
And nothing!

1171
01:28:28,884 --> 01:28:30,427
He skipped out.

1172
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,024
Bullshit.

1173
01:28:45,067 --> 01:28:48,195
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?

1174
01:28:49,113 --> 01:28:50,197
You're right.

1175
01:28:50,447 --> 01:28:52,241
It's probably bullshit.

1176
01:28:52,616 --> 01:28:54,994
Even if he did,
he couldn't unload it.

1177
01:28:55,452 --> 01:28:57,913
Not without drawing
all kinds of attention.

1178
01:28:58,497 --> 01:29:02,334
Maybe that's why he's under a house
in Elysian Park not smelling too good...

1179
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:05,129
<i>... paesano.</i>

1180
01:29:57,765 --> 01:30:00,142
Maybe White's
not so dumb after all.

1181
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:17,368
<i>We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,</i>
<i>and now Veronica Lake with White.</i>

1182
01:30:18,035 --> 01:30:22,247
I think your case and my case
are connected. It's Fleur-de-Lis again.

1183
01:30:22,539 --> 01:30:23,624
Fleur-de-Lis?

1184
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:26,168
"Whatever you desire."

1185
01:30:26,543 --> 01:30:27,544
Porno.

1186
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:30,714
High-class whores
cut to look like movie stars.

1187
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:34,510
Who knows what else? Reynolds,
the kid that got killed, was involved.

1188
01:30:34,885 --> 01:30:36,345
So is Pierce Patchett.

1189
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,888
The millionaire?

1190
01:30:38,555 --> 01:30:40,432
I think we should talk to him.

1191
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,227
First I want to brace Stompanato.

1192
01:30:59,618 --> 01:31:01,954
Want an autograph?
Write to MGM.

1193
01:31:02,955 --> 01:31:06,083
Since when do two-bit hoods
and hookers give out autographs?

1194
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:07,626
What?

1195
01:31:07,876 --> 01:31:09,128
LAPD. Sit down.

1196
01:31:09,378 --> 01:31:11,505
Who the hell do you think you are?

1197
01:31:11,755 --> 01:31:13,132
Take a walk, honey.

1198
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:16,677
- You're making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.

1199
01:31:17,052 --> 01:31:17,970
Shut up.

1200
01:31:19,596 --> 01:31:21,724
A hooker cut to look like Lana Turner
is still a hooker.

1201
01:31:22,933 --> 01:31:25,311
- She just looks like Lana Turner.
- She is Lana Turner.

1202
01:31:26,937 --> 01:31:28,689
She is Lana Turner.

1203
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,658
How was I supposed to know?

1204
01:31:55,966 --> 01:31:59,637
I believe the Nite Owl's
your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.

1205
01:32:00,054 --> 01:32:02,514
I saw you on television
getting your medal.

1206
01:32:04,183 --> 01:32:05,267
And you're...

1207
01:32:05,809 --> 01:32:09,563
...that other Hollywood
celebrity policeman, aren't you?

1208
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:14,485
The Veronica Lake look-alike works
for you. She's one of your whores.

1209
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:19,114
- A vulgar term.
- Why's she seeing Bud White?

1210
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:22,993
Why do men and women
usually see each other?

1211
01:32:26,038 --> 01:32:28,499
Let's try this on for size:
Fleur-de-Lis.

1212
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:30,876
"Whatever you desire."

1213
01:32:31,627 --> 01:32:33,045
An actor named...

1214
01:32:33,629 --> 01:32:34,546
...Matt Reynolds.

1215
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:37,257
Nothing?

1216
01:32:40,469 --> 01:32:42,179
We want some answers.

1217
01:32:45,015 --> 01:32:46,767
We all want something.

1218
01:32:49,186 --> 01:32:51,146
The guy's as cool as they come.

1219
01:32:53,691 --> 01:32:56,402
<i>Lieutenant Exley,</i>
<i>come in, please. Over.</i>

1220
01:32:57,653 --> 01:32:58,404
Exley.

1221
01:32:58,696 --> 01:33:01,573
<i>The coroner wants to talk to you.</i>
<i>He says he has your I.D.</i>

1222
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:05,035
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.

1223
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:07,496
- I'll drop you at your car.
- Where are you going?

1224
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:09,039
Lynn Bracken's.

1225
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:14,044
To find out why Patchett has her seeing
Bud White. See you at the Frolic Room.

1226
01:33:14,878 --> 01:33:18,090
Oh, great. You get the girl.
I get the coroner.

1227
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:31,103
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q.t.

1228
01:33:34,898 --> 01:33:37,443
I was just coming to see you.
Got that I.D.?

1229
01:33:37,735 --> 01:33:42,114
Thank God for dental records.
Stiff used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

1230
01:33:42,364 --> 01:33:43,282
Buzz Meeks?

1231
01:33:43,532 --> 01:33:44,867
- You knew him?
- Of him.

1232
01:33:45,117 --> 01:33:48,787
He was around when I joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.

1233
01:33:49,413 --> 01:33:50,664
"Just the facts."

1234
01:33:50,914 --> 01:33:52,583
"Just the facts."

1235
01:33:56,086 --> 01:33:57,004
Anything else?

1236
01:33:57,379 --> 01:34:01,216
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.
I need to see his arrest records.

1237
01:34:08,474 --> 01:34:09,308
Miss Bracken...

1238
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:10,893
...I'm Lieutenant Exley.

1239
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:12,311
I know.

1240
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,813
Bud told me all about you.

1241
01:34:15,272 --> 01:34:16,357
Is that so?

1242
01:34:17,483 --> 01:34:19,360
And what did White have to say?

1243
01:34:20,944 --> 01:34:22,821
He said you were smart.

1244
01:34:23,614 --> 01:34:27,284
He also said you were a coward, and that
you'd screw yourself to get ahead.

1245
01:34:28,077 --> 01:34:30,162
Let's concentrate on my smarts.

1246
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:35,417
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.

1247
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:38,462
And I'm impressed with the results.

1248
01:34:39,922 --> 01:34:41,090
But I need answers.

1249
01:34:41,507 --> 01:34:44,468
And if I don't get them,
I'll take you and Patchett down.

1250
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,805
Pierce Patchett
can take care of himself.

1251
01:34:49,014 --> 01:34:50,849
And I'm not afraid of you.

1252
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:54,311
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant...

1253
01:34:54,853 --> 01:34:57,314
...Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

1254
01:35:01,193 --> 01:35:02,945
And he tells you who to fuck.

1255
01:35:03,445 --> 01:35:05,322
Why are you fucking Bud White?

1256
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:08,701
What makes you think
I'm not seeing Bud because I want to?

1257
01:35:10,536 --> 01:35:13,747
It would be easier for you
if there was an angle, wouldn't it?

1258
01:35:14,665 --> 01:35:17,543
You're afraid of Bud because you can't
figure out how to play him.

1259
01:35:18,836 --> 01:35:21,922
He doesn't follow
the same rules of politics as you do.

1260
01:35:22,798 --> 01:35:24,425
It makes him dangerous.

1261
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,884
I can handle Bud White.

1262
01:35:26,343 --> 01:35:27,344
Can you?

1263
01:35:31,515 --> 01:35:33,600
I see Bud because I want to.

1264
01:35:37,187 --> 01:35:40,399
I see Bud because
he can't hide the good inside of him.

1265
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:44,987
I see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken...

1266
01:35:45,362 --> 01:35:48,574
...and not a Veronica Lake
look-alike who fucks for money.

1267
01:35:50,868 --> 01:35:55,039
I see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.

1268
01:35:57,207 --> 01:36:00,711
I see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.

1269
01:36:03,255 --> 01:36:05,215
Don't underestimate me.

1270
01:36:05,883 --> 01:36:08,761
The way you've
underestimated Bud White?

1271
01:36:15,351 --> 01:36:18,020
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing.

1272
01:36:18,562 --> 01:36:20,439
Stop talking about Bud White.

1273
01:36:45,464 --> 01:36:47,257
Come on.

1274
01:36:50,094 --> 01:36:51,261
Shit.

1275
01:37:04,775 --> 01:37:06,360
Jack Vincennes.

1276
01:37:07,444 --> 01:37:08,988
It's going on midnight.

1277
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:11,156
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.

1278
01:37:11,657 --> 01:37:12,658
It's important.

1279
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:17,663
Good thing for you my wife and daughters
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

1280
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,419
Do you remember Buzz Meeks?

1281
01:37:23,711 --> 01:37:25,921
A disgrace as a police officer.

1282
01:37:26,297 --> 01:37:30,342
Straight D fitness reports from every
C.O. He ever served under. Why?

1283
01:37:31,135 --> 01:37:33,887
12 years ago, he was on a vice roust
with Dick Stensland.

1284
01:37:34,263 --> 01:37:37,433
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

1285
01:37:37,808 --> 01:37:41,854
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.

1286
01:37:42,646 --> 01:37:45,482
Anyway, charges were dropped.
Insufficient evidence.

1287
01:37:45,858 --> 01:37:50,195
You were the supervising officer on
that case. Remember anything about it?

1288
01:37:51,613 --> 01:37:53,032
What's this about, boyo?

1289
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:57,453
It has to do with a murder
I've been working with Exley on.

1290
01:37:57,995 --> 01:38:00,456
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

1291
01:38:00,873 --> 01:38:02,875
Since when do you work with Exley?

1292
01:38:04,168 --> 01:38:06,378
It's a private investigation.

1293
01:38:08,631 --> 01:38:11,091
I messed something up.
I'm trying to make amends.

1294
01:38:11,342 --> 01:38:15,012
Don't start trying to do the right
thing. You haven't had the practice.

1295
01:38:22,728 --> 01:38:25,564
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.

1296
01:38:28,817 --> 01:38:31,362
So, what does Exley make of this?

1297
01:38:32,029 --> 01:38:35,157
I haven't told him yet.
I just came from the records room.

1298
01:39:01,058 --> 01:39:03,143
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1299
01:39:09,566 --> 01:39:11,068
Rollo...

1300
01:39:12,236 --> 01:39:13,779
...Tomasi.

1301
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,220
<i>Sergeant Vincennes was killed</i>
<i>by a.32 slug to the heart.</i>

1302
01:39:38,595 --> 01:39:40,806
<i>Time of death, approximately 1 a.m.</i>

1303
01:39:41,515 --> 01:39:46,729
Although he was found in Echo Park,
forensics indicates the body was moved.

1304
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:51,025
I want 2-man teams to scour
that entire neighborhood.

1305
01:39:52,109 --> 01:39:54,320
Our justice must be swift...

1306
01:39:54,737 --> 01:39:56,196
...and merciless.

1307
01:39:58,490 --> 01:39:59,408
That is all.

1308
01:40:09,293 --> 01:40:11,128
Might I have a word with you?

1309
01:40:14,423 --> 01:40:17,301
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

1310
01:40:17,676 --> 01:40:20,346
The records check has led to a dead end.

1311
01:40:20,763 --> 01:40:21,847
What's the name?

1312
01:40:22,306 --> 01:40:23,682
Rollo Tomasi?

1313
01:40:25,768 --> 01:40:27,645
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?

1314
01:40:30,648 --> 01:40:32,191
No. No, I haven't.

1315
01:40:36,987 --> 01:40:38,906
It's probably nothing. Still...

1316
01:40:40,157 --> 01:40:42,076
...keep your eyes open, boyo.

1317
01:40:52,378 --> 01:40:54,922
I know it's unlikely, but suppose...

1318
01:40:55,339 --> 01:40:58,717
...somebody had a lot of heroin,
who would they go to to move it?

1319
01:40:59,301 --> 01:41:01,261
White, in my office.

1320
01:41:01,637 --> 01:41:04,098
Captain. Look, just give me a name.

1321
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:06,183
Mickey Cohen.

1322
01:41:12,356 --> 01:41:13,273
Captain?

1323
01:41:13,524 --> 01:41:15,985
I could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

1324
01:41:17,528 --> 01:41:18,529
When?

1325
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:21,031
Now.

1326
01:41:23,367 --> 01:41:24,910
Close the door, lad.

1327
01:41:32,543 --> 01:41:35,421
You're a bit of a
puzzlement to me these days.

1328
01:41:35,838 --> 01:41:38,007
You don't seem your old cruel self.

1329
01:41:38,716 --> 01:41:41,593
And I had such grand plans
for your future.

1330
01:41:41,844 --> 01:41:42,928
What plans?

1331
01:41:44,513 --> 01:41:48,350
You have your extracurricular
activities and I have mine.

1332
01:41:51,562 --> 01:41:54,606
We must have a clarification
session one of these days.

1333
01:41:55,733 --> 01:41:56,650
However...

1334
01:41:57,568 --> 01:41:58,736
...right now...

1335
01:41:59,403 --> 01:42:02,614
...we'll brace a man who may know
who killed Jack Vincennes.

1336
01:42:02,948 --> 01:42:04,617
So the question is...

1337
01:42:05,034 --> 01:42:06,535
...can I count on you, lad?

1338
01:42:06,785 --> 01:42:08,495
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.

1339
01:42:13,709 --> 01:42:17,379
I want to know everything you and
Vincennes talked about last night.

1340
01:42:17,713 --> 01:42:19,673
Start with the I.D. on the corpse.

1341
01:42:19,923 --> 01:42:20,924
An ex-cop.

1342
01:42:21,342 --> 01:42:23,093
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.

1343
01:42:23,469 --> 01:42:24,637
An ex-cop?

1344
01:42:25,304 --> 01:42:26,680
Did Jack know him?

1345
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:29,266
Only by reputation.

1346
01:42:35,481 --> 01:42:37,608
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

1347
01:42:37,858 --> 01:42:40,569
I'm willing to cooperate.
No need to tie me down.

1348
01:42:40,944 --> 01:42:42,655
It's for your own safety.

1349
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:46,867
What can you tell us
about Sgt. Jack Vincennes?

1350
01:42:47,117 --> 01:42:49,203
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1351
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:52,498
I can tell you he's on
the night train to the Big <i>Adios.</i>

1352
01:42:56,794 --> 01:43:00,214
I had nothing to do with him
getting killed, if that's what you mean.

1353
01:43:00,589 --> 01:43:04,426
- But you were business associates.
- What's that got to do with anything?

1354
01:43:06,387 --> 01:43:08,472
Okay, so we worked together.

1355
01:43:09,098 --> 01:43:11,100
It was an information exchange.

1356
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:15,604
I got him first-class collars, he got me
good stories. We were friends.

1357
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:17,439
We'll drop that for now.

1358
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,775
What about Pierce Patchett?

1359
01:43:20,025 --> 01:43:23,946
You think he had something to do
with Vincennes getting iced?

1360
01:43:24,905 --> 01:43:28,033
I'd like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

1361
01:43:28,742 --> 01:43:31,120
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1362
01:43:32,788 --> 01:43:35,582
Everyone knows Patchett's
worth a boatload.

1363
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:37,835
But he has hobbies too.

1364
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:40,671
He bankrolls B movies under the table.

1365
01:43:41,213 --> 01:43:42,715
And try this one on.

1366
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:45,217
He's rumored to be a heroin sniffer.

1367
01:43:45,509 --> 01:43:48,429
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

1368
01:43:48,721 --> 01:43:50,639
- And?
- And what?

1369
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:58,397
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens,
is the key to every relationship.

1370
01:44:01,734 --> 01:44:03,235
He runs call girls.

1371
01:44:05,237 --> 01:44:08,198
Primo tail fixed up
to look like movie stars.

1372
01:44:11,076 --> 01:44:11,910
And?

1373
01:44:12,578 --> 01:44:14,038
Blackmail shit.

1374
01:44:14,955 --> 01:44:17,082
In my car, in the trunk,
under the rug...

1375
01:44:18,042 --> 01:44:22,212
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.

1376
01:44:22,463 --> 01:44:24,548
She looks just like Veronica Lake.

1377
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:26,842
Leave him!

1378
01:44:27,092 --> 01:44:28,677
I said leave him be!

1379
01:44:29,053 --> 01:44:30,387
Get him away from me!

1380
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:32,514
Back off!

1381
01:45:16,809 --> 01:45:21,647
I wouldn't trade places with Exley right
now for all the whiskey in Ireland.

1382
01:45:25,818 --> 01:45:29,405
Dudley, I thought you were going to
let the dumb bastard kill me!

1383
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,408
Learn to pull your punches
a little better.

1384
01:45:32,825 --> 01:45:34,785
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1385
01:45:40,582 --> 01:45:41,750
Fellas...

1386
01:45:43,752 --> 01:45:44,670
...we had a deal.

1387
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:46,422
You, me, Patchett. We're a team.

1388
01:45:51,593 --> 01:45:52,845
Hush-hush.

1389
01:45:54,096 --> 01:45:55,973
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1390
01:45:56,348 --> 01:45:58,976
Meeks never made an arrest
the entire time he worked Vice?

1391
01:45:59,351 --> 01:46:01,145
Someone must've pulled the files.

1392
01:46:03,856 --> 01:46:05,649
What about the daily report books?

1393
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:09,111
- They'd be buried in the basement.
- Find them.

1394
01:46:40,184 --> 01:46:41,685
You talk to Exley?

1395
01:46:42,269 --> 01:46:43,896
Come in out of the rain.

1396
01:46:46,065 --> 01:46:48,025
What happened with Exley?

1397
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:51,111
Just come in.

1398
01:46:52,571 --> 01:46:55,115
Will you tell me
what happened with Exley?

1399
01:46:55,824 --> 01:46:57,076
We talked.

1400
01:46:57,743 --> 01:46:58,827
Tell me about him.

1401
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,120
Later.

1402
01:47:01,121 --> 01:47:02,122
Now!

1403
01:47:05,459 --> 01:47:07,002
You fucked him.

1404
01:47:10,714 --> 01:47:12,049
You fucked him.

1405
01:47:12,883 --> 01:47:14,885
I thought I was helping you.

1406
01:48:05,936 --> 01:48:08,147
I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.

1407
01:48:17,823 --> 01:48:18,741
Wait.

1408
01:48:45,643 --> 01:48:47,061
Dudley killed Jack.

1409
01:48:47,811 --> 01:48:49,521
He wants you to kill me.

1410
01:48:52,733 --> 01:48:54,735
He showed you the photo, didn't he?

1411
01:48:55,569 --> 01:48:56,570
Didn't he?

1412
01:48:59,239 --> 01:49:01,200
Think! Goddamn you, think!

1413
01:49:03,953 --> 01:49:05,037
Get out!

1414
01:49:21,512 --> 01:49:23,722
I checked the daily report books.

1415
01:49:24,848 --> 01:49:28,185
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

1416
01:49:31,897 --> 01:49:33,649
I knew Stensland lied to me.

1417
01:49:36,777 --> 01:49:39,738
Lefferts' mother I.D.'d
him as Lefferts' boyfriend.

1418
01:49:41,615 --> 01:49:46,078
Stensland pretended he didn't know
Meeks or her the night that I met...

1419
01:49:47,538 --> 01:49:48,622
...Lynn.

1420
01:49:49,665 --> 01:49:51,083
Stensland and Meeks...

1421
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:53,252
...what were they up to?

1422
01:49:54,211 --> 01:49:57,548
I don't know. But I think
Stens killed Meeks over heroin.

1423
01:49:58,090 --> 01:49:59,091
What heroin?

1424
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:08,600
Johnny Stompanato told me
that Meeks had heroin for sale.

1425
01:50:09,059 --> 01:50:10,644
Meeks ends up dead.

1426
01:50:11,228 --> 01:50:13,355
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1427
01:50:14,315 --> 01:50:15,983
It wasn't the Negroes.

1428
01:50:17,067 --> 01:50:19,028
The rape victim lied.

1429
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:23,073
The first guys to the Mercury coupe
were Breuning and Carlisle.

1430
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:24,825
Dudley's guys.

1431
01:50:25,367 --> 01:50:27,119
They planted the shotguns.

1432
01:50:27,369 --> 01:50:30,789
They'd have killed the Negroes too
if Jack and I hadn't shown up.

1433
01:50:31,665 --> 01:50:34,877
Dudley framed them because
they were Negroes and had records.

1434
01:50:35,169 --> 01:50:37,630
He knew there'd be no questions asked...

1435
01:50:39,173 --> 01:50:41,550
...if they were killed resisting arrest.

1436
01:50:42,593 --> 01:50:44,887
Somehow it's all connected
to Jack's angle.

1437
01:50:45,596 --> 01:50:46,930
Sid Hudgens...

1438
01:50:47,514 --> 01:50:49,642
...the pictures to blackmail
Ellis Loew...

1439
01:50:50,809 --> 01:50:52,061
A kid got murdered.

1440
01:50:53,228 --> 01:50:55,397
To figure it out,
we must work together.

1441
01:51:01,111 --> 01:51:02,821
Why are you doing this?

1442
01:51:04,823 --> 01:51:06,533
The Nite Owl made you.

1443
01:51:08,452 --> 01:51:10,079
You want to tear all that down?

1444
01:51:11,705 --> 01:51:13,374
With a wrecking ball.

1445
01:51:13,999 --> 01:51:15,793
Want to help me swing it?

1446
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:30,099
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

1447
01:51:30,683 --> 01:51:33,352
Find out what
the District Attorney knows.

1448
01:51:41,443 --> 01:51:43,070
You can't go in there.

1449
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:48,575
- Want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
- Ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.

1450
01:51:48,784 --> 01:51:52,538
Tell him we're discussing an unemployed
actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.

1451
01:51:52,788 --> 01:51:53,789
These are the police.

1452
01:52:00,587 --> 01:52:01,755
What do you want?

1453
01:52:02,047 --> 01:52:06,302
I want D.A. Bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.

1454
01:52:06,593 --> 01:52:09,930
I want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.

1455
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:12,474
I want authorization
to check their bank records.

1456
01:52:13,017 --> 01:52:14,435
On what evidence?

1457
01:52:15,019 --> 01:52:16,729
Call it a hunch.

1458
01:52:17,938 --> 01:52:19,648
Absolutely not.

1459
01:52:19,898 --> 01:52:22,818
Dudley Smith is a highly-decorated
member of the department.

1460
01:52:23,068 --> 01:52:25,029
I won't smear his and
Patchett's name without...

1461
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:26,655
Without what?

1462
01:52:27,072 --> 01:52:28,782
Them smearing yours first?

1463
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:32,828
What do they have? Pictures of you
and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?

1464
01:52:35,205 --> 01:52:36,206
You have proof?

1465
01:52:36,957 --> 01:52:38,667
The proof had his throat slit.

1466
01:52:40,044 --> 01:52:42,171
So far, you're not denying it.

1467
01:52:43,547 --> 01:52:45,507
I won't dignify this with answers.

1468
01:52:45,758 --> 01:52:48,135
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me...

1469
01:52:48,427 --> 01:52:52,264
...I have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that I have to prepare for.

1470
01:53:02,608 --> 01:53:06,445
Unless you came to wipe my ass,
I believe we're through.

1471
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:15,496
Don't pull that good-cop-bad-cop crap.
I practically invented it.

1472
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,457
So what if some homo actor is dead.

1473
01:53:18,707 --> 01:53:21,752
Boys, girls. Ten of them
get off the bus to L.A. Everyday.

1474
01:53:29,677 --> 01:53:30,928
Pull him off me!

1475
01:53:31,178 --> 01:53:32,054
I don't know how.

1476
01:53:36,058 --> 01:53:39,895
I know you think you're the A-number-one
hotshot, but here's the juice.

1477
01:53:40,145 --> 01:53:42,523
If I kill you, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

1478
01:53:42,773 --> 01:53:44,608
They just won't come on a bus.

1479
01:53:58,539 --> 01:53:59,623
Okay!

1480
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,210
Dudley and Patchett, they...

1481
01:54:04,336 --> 01:54:05,337
Oh, my God!

1482
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:07,673
I wouldn't play ball so they set me up!

1483
01:54:07,923 --> 01:54:09,967
I gave in!
But the kid heard everything...

1484
01:54:11,468 --> 01:54:12,428
...so they killed him.

1485
01:54:12,678 --> 01:54:13,679
Why?

1486
01:54:14,054 --> 01:54:17,433
- What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
- Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.

1487
01:54:17,683 --> 01:54:21,603
Because of those pictures
I couldn't prosecute them!

1488
01:54:21,979 --> 01:54:23,314
Oh, Jesus!

1489
01:54:23,564 --> 01:54:24,481
Help me up!

1490
01:54:33,657 --> 01:54:35,784
Is that how you ran
the good-cop bad-cop?

1491
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:39,538
Patchett?

1492
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:17,618
Looks like his bodyguard
had a conflict of interest.

1493
01:55:24,041 --> 01:55:25,417
Suicide note.

1494
01:55:25,668 --> 01:55:30,047
Says he killed Jack because Jack had
figured out his pornography scam.

1495
01:55:30,297 --> 01:55:32,424
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea.

1496
01:55:33,884 --> 01:55:35,302
2 of his fingers are broken.

1497
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,470
They held him there.

1498
01:55:38,722 --> 01:55:39,640
Or drugged him.

1499
01:55:43,102 --> 01:55:44,853
Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

1500
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:46,981
Patchett's dead.

1501
01:55:47,272 --> 01:55:48,899
He sent you after me.

1502
01:55:50,567 --> 01:55:51,735
Lynn.

1503
01:55:52,903 --> 01:55:54,071
West Hollywood Sheriff.

1504
01:55:54,321 --> 01:55:57,157
- They're closer than we are.
- I'll get the car. Keys!

1505
01:56:04,665 --> 01:56:07,209
We took her to the station
for safekeeping.

1506
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:11,797
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless I okay it.

1507
01:56:12,589 --> 01:56:14,300
Someone worked her over.

1508
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,176
She wouldn't say who.

1509
01:56:21,348 --> 01:56:22,975
See you, Exley.

1510
01:56:26,186 --> 01:56:27,688
We should talk to Lynn.

1511
01:56:28,689 --> 01:56:29,857
You do it.

1512
01:56:30,566 --> 01:56:31,650
What will you do?

1513
01:56:34,945 --> 01:56:36,864
I'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.

1514
01:56:37,615 --> 01:56:40,242
Compliment him on his
performance at the Victory Motel.

1515
01:56:40,492 --> 01:56:42,661
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.

1516
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:45,331
I'll get the evidence.

1517
01:56:57,885 --> 01:56:58,886
Are you okay?

1518
01:57:01,639 --> 01:57:02,640
You okay?

1519
01:57:13,317 --> 01:57:15,277
Bud hates himself for what he did.

1520
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:18,572
I know how he feels.

1521
01:57:20,908 --> 01:57:23,744
I need to know what you
can give me on Dudley Smith.

1522
01:57:25,829 --> 01:57:28,207
He's a police captain
in business with Patchett.

1523
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:30,459
I've never heard of him.

1524
01:57:34,672 --> 01:57:36,256
Do you have a place to stay?

1525
01:57:38,008 --> 01:57:39,510
I'll be okay.

1526
01:57:46,141 --> 01:57:48,477
Nobody goes in without official I.D.

1527
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:54,858
It's okay. Let him through.

1528
01:57:58,445 --> 01:57:59,822
What happened?

1529
01:58:00,364 --> 01:58:03,367
Someone beat him to death,
and stole a bunch of files.

1530
01:58:03,617 --> 01:58:05,619
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

1531
01:58:06,036 --> 01:58:07,997
We got it narrowed down
to 1000 suspects.

1532
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:10,541
Sergeant White...

1533
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:13,168
...dispatch got a call for you.

1534
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:16,463
Lieutenant Exley wants you
to meet him at the Victory Motel.

1535
01:58:50,414 --> 01:58:51,999
You wanted to meet here?

1536
01:58:54,084 --> 01:58:57,129
- You called it. I thought Hudgens was...
- Hudgens is dead.

1537
01:59:08,557 --> 01:59:10,100
Let's get out of here.

1538
01:59:17,524 --> 01:59:18,901
It's too late.

1539
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:10,494
You figured it was a set-up
but came anyway?

1540
02:00:10,744 --> 02:00:12,746
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

1541
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:15,499
It's as good a place as any
for it to end.

1542
02:00:25,801 --> 02:00:26,802
Clip.

1543
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:34,685
All I ever wanted
was to measure up to my father.

1544
02:00:35,769 --> 02:00:36,687
Now's your chance.

1545
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,275
He died in the line of duty, didn't he?

1546
02:02:40,936 --> 02:02:42,104
Goddamn it!

1547
02:03:42,289 --> 02:03:42,998
You okay?

1548
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:45,084
Yeah.

1549
02:04:03,644 --> 02:04:05,646
Come on. Easy.

1550
02:04:12,403 --> 02:04:13,279
Move!

1551
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:37,469
Rollo Tomasi.

1552
02:04:40,931 --> 02:04:42,308
Who is he?

1553
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:44,226
You are.

1554
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,355
You're the guy who gets away with it.

1555
02:04:52,484 --> 02:04:53,569
Jack knew it.

1556
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:55,070
And so do I.

1557
02:05:20,846 --> 02:05:22,556
Are you going to shoot me...

1558
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:24,850
...or arrest me?

1559
02:05:31,273 --> 02:05:32,524
Good lad.

1560
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:35,277
Always the politician.

1561
02:05:35,903 --> 02:05:37,738
Let me do the talking.

1562
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:41,408
After I'm done, they'll make you
Chief of Detectives.

1563
02:06:09,269 --> 02:06:10,980
Hold up your badge...

1564
02:06:11,271 --> 02:06:13,190
...so they'll know you're a policeman.

1565
02:07:03,741 --> 02:07:06,577
<i>You think you can talk</i>
<i>your way out of this, Lieutenant?</i>

1566
02:07:09,204 --> 02:07:10,372
No...

1567
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:12,207
...but I can tell the truth.

1568
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:15,085
During our investigation...

1569
02:07:16,211 --> 02:07:19,298
...of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

1570
02:07:20,382 --> 02:07:23,802
...Jack Vincennes, Bud White
and I learned the following:

1571
02:07:24,553 --> 02:07:27,014
Your golden boy's
throwing his whole life away.

1572
02:07:27,264 --> 02:07:28,766
The 3 Nite Owl suspects...

1573
02:07:29,725 --> 02:07:32,186
...while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

1574
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:35,981
...were innocent of the
multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.

1575
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:39,276
The gunmen were most likely...

1576
02:07:39,526 --> 02:07:44,281
...Los Angeles police officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle...

1577
02:07:44,531 --> 02:07:45,991
...and a third man...

1578
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:50,329
...who may or may not have been
Captain Dudley Smith.

1579
02:07:51,413 --> 02:07:52,873
The objective:

1580
02:07:53,832 --> 02:07:56,460
The elimination of
another police officer...

1581
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:58,504
...Richard Stensland...

1582
02:07:59,421 --> 02:08:04,385
...who, along with former LAPD officer
Leland "Buzz" Meeks...

1583
02:08:05,469 --> 02:08:09,139
...also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

1584
02:08:09,848 --> 02:08:11,433
...and then betrayed him...

1585
02:08:11,725 --> 02:08:13,936
...over 25 pounds of heroin...

1586
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:16,897
...the retrieval of which...

1587
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:20,234
...was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

1588
02:08:23,445 --> 02:08:26,699
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

1589
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:32,037
...Capt. Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in Los Angeles.

1590
02:08:33,914 --> 02:08:37,584
This includes the assassinations
of Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

1591
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:41,380
...the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

1592
02:08:43,007 --> 02:08:47,553
...and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

1593
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:51,056
...and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1594
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:57,146
Captain Smith admitted as much to me...

1595
02:08:57,771 --> 02:08:59,690
...before I shot him...

1596
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:01,859
...at the Victory Motel.

1597
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:05,154
That's it.

1598
02:09:10,117 --> 02:09:12,119
The press will have a field day.

1599
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:15,164
Christ!

1600
02:09:15,414 --> 02:09:17,708
It'll stain the Department for years.

1601
02:09:17,958 --> 02:09:18,834
Decades.

1602
02:09:20,169 --> 02:09:22,713
If we can get the kid to play ball...

1603
02:09:23,797 --> 02:09:25,591
...who's to say what happened?

1604
02:09:26,717 --> 02:09:29,178
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1605
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:31,972
- Good idea.
- If we get the press to play.

1606
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:42,566
<i>Want to tell me what</i>
<i>you're smiling about?</i>

1607
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:49,281
A hero.

1608
02:09:49,907 --> 02:09:51,575
How'd he know what we said?

1609
02:09:51,825 --> 02:09:53,452
He couldn't have heard us.

1610
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:59,166
In this situation...

1611
02:09:59,541 --> 02:10:01,460
...you'll need more than one.

1612
02:10:08,425 --> 02:10:13,305
<i>It is my pleasure to present this award</i>
<i>to Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...</i>

1613
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,975
<i>... two-time Medal of Valor recipient.</i>

1614
02:10:26,193 --> 02:10:30,114
Next year the LAPD
will move into its new facility.

1615
02:10:30,531 --> 02:10:32,199
With leaders like Edmund Exley...

1616
02:10:32,449 --> 02:10:35,536
...the image of fat cops stealing apples
will be left behind...

1617
02:10:35,786 --> 02:10:39,623
...and Los Angeles will finally
have the police force it deserves.

1618
02:10:53,595 --> 02:10:55,681
You just couldn't resist.

1619
02:10:55,973 --> 02:10:58,517
They're using me.
So for a while, I'm using them.

1620
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:01,645
Come on.

1621
02:11:36,555 --> 02:11:37,806
Thanks for the push.

1622
02:11:59,662 --> 02:12:01,664
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.

1623
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,086
Some men get the world...

1624
02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:11,173
...others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.
