1
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:31,013
I'm just gonna get some flowers, dear.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:36,502
It's tulip season today,
and I'm, so happy.

3
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,800
- Son of a...
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,595
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,642
Excuse me.

6
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:55,563
Yes, come on.
Come on, now, sweetheart.

7
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:58,024
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.

8
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:01,694
Go for a little ride, then you
can whiz all over the city.

9
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,696
Come on.

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,950
Come on. Go for a ride.
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

11
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,870
No!
Freeze, freeze.

12
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,706
Leg down. Leg down.
Leg down. Leg down.

13
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,835
That's it. That's it.
Come on, now.

14
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:20,963
Come on. Come on, now.
Come on.

15
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:24,216
No!
You monkey-eared son of a...

16
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:29,013
You... have pissed your last floor.

17
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:32,433
I bet you... wish you were... a real d...

18
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:35,311
Oh, you...

19
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,606
you dog-eared monkey.

20
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,235
This is New York. If you can make
it here, you can make it anywhere.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,030
You ugly, smelly...

22
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,081
Verdell?

23
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,584
Verdell?
Verdell?

24
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:02,338
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

25
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,050
Come here, sweetheart.

26
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,846
Mr. Udall?

27
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:17,103
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

28
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,984
My dog.
You know, my...

29
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,362
my dog with the little face,
little adorable face.

30
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,198
Don't you know what my dog looks like?

31
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:32,785
I got it.
You were talking about your dog. Yeah.

32
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:37,206
I thought it was the name of that colored
man that I've been seeing in the halls.

33
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,209
Which color was that?

34
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:45,589
Like thick molasses.
With a broad nose.

35
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,134
Frank! Perfect for smelling
trouble and prison food.

36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,846
Frank!
Simon, you have got to get dressed.

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,723
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.
- How ya doin'?

38
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,725
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.

39
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:59,812
I think... Yeah, I think you know that.
People are gonna start coming.

40
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:04,191
What I know is as long as you keep
your work zipped up around me,

41
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:07,319
I don't give a rat crap what
or where you shove your show.

42
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:10,239
Are we done being neighbors for now?

43
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,995
Let me talk to you for a minute.
No, no, no.

44
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,666
Not worth it. Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

45
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,837
Okay.

46
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:28,382
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

47
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,845
You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.

48
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:58,871
One, two, three, four, five.

49
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,584
One, two, three, four, five.

50
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:05,794
Okay.

51
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:27,191
Hot!
Hot, hot, hot!

52
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,084
Oh, Carl, Carl.

53
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:48,254
Hi, Carl. Frank.
So, where is he?

54
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,621
He's here, isn't he? He lives here.
No, no. Take it easy.

55
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,633
He just had a little thing with the dog.

56
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,160
First of all, it's not such a
hot-looking dog. He's adorable.

57
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,638
Where are you going, Frank?
Who buys more than me?

58
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:01,308
Good Lord!
My honey, where have you been?

59
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:07,940
Look at my boy!
Look at him!

60
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,322
- Yeah, I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

61
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:18,492
Where was my little baby?
Where was my baby?

62
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:22,538
In the basement garbage bin,
eating diaper shit.

63
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,335
Go ahead, John.
You earned your fun.

64
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,672
I'm sorry.
It just struck me as funny.

65
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:34,466
Wait.

66
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,303
How did he get down in the basement?

67
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,346
I mean, even if he got in the elevator...

68
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,767
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved
him down the garbage chute?

69
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:49,481
"Somewhere in the dark,

70
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:53,277
"She had confessed, and he had forgiven.

71
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,155
"'This is what you live for, ' he said.

72
00:05:56,239 --> 00:06:00,159
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval,

73
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:05,164
"and there is only the safety
of being with each other.

74
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:08,709
"How, she wondered,
could she find such hope...

75
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,961
"in the most shameful part of her?

76
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:16,759
Mr. Udall?
"At last, she was able to define love.

77
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,345
Love was..."

78
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:22,097
Mr. Udall,
I'd like to speak to you, please.

79
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,017
Let me do this by myself.

80
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:28,312
"Love was..."
Are you in there?

81
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,564
Son of a bitch!

82
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,025
Pansy ass stool pusher!

83
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,069
Yes!

84
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:38,864
Maybe this can wait.
Yeah.

85
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:43,660
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

86
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,627
Well, that's a load off.

87
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,881
Did you...
Did you do something to him?

88
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,759
Do you realize that I work at home?

89
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,887
No.
I wasn't aware.

90
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:07,142
Do you like to be interrupted when you're
nancing around in your little garden?

91
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:11,522
No, no, I...
No, no.

92
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:16,068
I actually will turn the ringer off on my phone
and sometimes put a piece of cardboard in...

93
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:18,112
Well, I work all the time.

94
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:22,449
So never, never interrupt me.
Okay?

95
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,160
Not if there's a fire,

96
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,525
not even if you hear the sound
of a thud from my home...

97
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,083
and one week later, there's a smell
coming from there that can only be...

98
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:35,003
a decaying human body, and you have
to hold a hankie to your face...

99
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,257
because the stench is so thick
that you think you're gonna faint.

100
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:41,635
Even then, don't come knocking.

101
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,972
Or, if it's election night,

102
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:49,935
and you're excited and you want to celebrate
because some fudge packer that you date...

103
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,439
has been elected the first queer
president of the United States,

104
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:58,527
and he's going to have you
down to Camp David,

105
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,989
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

106
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:06,118
Even then, don't knock.

107
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:08,620
Not on this door.

108
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,999
Not for any reason.

109
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,210
Do you get me, sweetheart?

110
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:19,256
Yes.

111
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,343
It's not a... subtle point
that you're making.

112
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:26,221
Okay, then.

113
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:43,780
So, the theory of confrontation says now
he'll think twice before messing with me.

114
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:51,455
All right.

115
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,209
"Love was..."

116
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,631
What was love?

117
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,509
"Love was..."

118
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:13,185
Now I'm pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

119
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,521
Don't touch.

120
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,190
Don't touch! Don't touch!
Shut up!

121
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,955
You think you can intimidate the whole world
with your attitude, but you don't intimidate me.

122
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,904
I grew up in hell, homeboy.

123
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,157
My grandmother had more attitude.
Police!

124
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:31,328
Doughnut-munching morons!
Help me!

125
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,040
Help me! Help me!
Shut up!

126
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,584
Assault and battery, and you're black!

127
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:42,214
I like Simon! I like him enough
to batter you unrecognizable...

128
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:47,135
if you verbally abuse him or so
much as touch that dog again.

129
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,391
Meantime,

130
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:56,395
I'm gonna think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

131
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,690
I hate doin' this!
I'm an art dealer.

132
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:04,903
Have a nice day.
Okay. Party.

133
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:07,489
Party!

134
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:26,341
Excuse me.

135
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,678
Don't touch.
Don't touch. Get a life.

136
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,932
Hey, watch it!
Don't touch!

137
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,692
Look at you.
You're all better?

138
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,445
It's that new medication.
So you know all my son's stuff, right?

139
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,656
No, no, no, no. I got a date tonight.
I'm walkin' out the door, he says to me,

140
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:53,243
"Mom, I promise not to get one of my
fevers or coughs during your date."

141
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:58,540
Isn't that sweet? Little blond angel.
Eats everything.

142
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,625
It just came out. I said, "You love me
the way you love your remote control.

143
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,548
As long as I switch every time you press
one of my buttons." That's great.

144
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,506
I know, yeah.
Terrific.

145
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:11,136
I think people that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

146
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,598
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

147
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:18,810
No, you pay me next week. No, I owe you.
I told you today. That's the rule.

148
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,979
'Scuse me, Melvin.

149
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,940
'Scuse me.

150
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:27,235
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

151
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,990
Pardon me.

152
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:35,118
Pardon me. Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

153
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:38,288
This way you take a cab home so you
have time to get ready for the date.

154
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,749
"Ready" is not my problem.

155
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,085
I'm starving!

156
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,213
Go on. Sit down.
You know you're not allowed back here.

157
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,340
Spence is more excited by it than I am.

158
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:52,135
He says, "Mom, I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

159
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,971
Coming through.
Sometimes, this kid, you just wanna...

160
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:58,725
I've got Jews at my table.

161
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,395
It's not you're table;
it's the place's table. Behave.

162
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,522
This once, you can sit
at someone else's station.

163
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,734
Or you can wait your turn.

164
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,159
You have feelings for... Well, yes.

165
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,746
How much more you got to eat?

166
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,378
Appetites aren't as big as your noses?

167
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,672
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

168
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:32,509
All right.
Let me talk to him. Let's go.

169
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,470
Barred for life.
Here I go!

170
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,151
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

171
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,115
Bryan says he doesn't care
how long you've been coming.

172
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,577
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

173
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,788
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

174
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,542
Three eggs over easy,

175
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,961
two sausage, six strips
of bacon with fries.

176
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:10,922
- Fries today?
- A short stack,

177
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:14,176
coffee with cream and sweetener.

178
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,429
You're gonna die soon with
that diet, you know that.

179
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:22,184
Ah, we're all gonna die soon. I will, you
will, and it sure sounds like your son will.

180
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:45,290
If you ever mention my son again,
you will never be able to eat here again.

181
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,667
Do you understand?

182
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,970
Give me some sign you
understand, or leave now.

183
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:05,185
Do you understand me, you crazy fuck?

184
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,983
Do you?

185
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,744
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.

186
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,289
Yes.

187
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,669
Okay, I'll get your order.

188
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,966
Why don't you wear my earrings tonight.

189
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:42,347
It's just so
interesting what you said at dinner.

190
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,684
You said it like it was nothin'.
I mean if you...

191
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:52,732
Where's the bedroom?
The truth...

192
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:55,151
This is sort of it.
I sort of...

193
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:57,946
I sort of sleep in here.

194
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,791
Don't worry about it.

195
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,901
What?

196
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,070
I don't know.

197
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:50,624
Grandma.
Grandma.

198
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,293
Maybe you'd better check.

199
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,295
What did you think I was gonna do?

200
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,467
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,262
Mom! Mama! I was hearing
everything that you were doing,

202
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:07,766
so I put these on to give you privacy.

203
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:11,561
So how was dinner?
Hey, pal.

204
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,313
How's your friend?
You okay?

205
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,358
Not bad.
You got a temperature?

206
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,610
Scootch over.

207
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:20,654
Where did your friend take you to eat?

208
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,697
Nice place.

209
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:26,701
Carol, I have him.
Carol.

210
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,664
One more spit. I said I have him.
He's waiting.

211
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,458
Go!
She has me.

212
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,794
Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
Carol!

213
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,339
Give me a big hug.
Carol, I have him.

214
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,342
I'm okay, Mom.
She has me. Go.

215
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,224
Close the curtains.

216
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:56,940
No, no, no. You can't smoke.
He can't take smoke.

217
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,694
Magic.

218
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:13,164
Oh, God.
Well, that'll teach you.

219
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,084
I don't even notice it anymore.

220
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,670
All right.
Come here.

221
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,193
It's all right.
You don't have to get that embarrassed.

222
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,450
It's a little bit of throw-up.

223
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,937
Little bit of throw up.

224
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:39,983
Well, what should we do?

225
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:43,486
Want me to write down which trains you take
to get home, or you wanna lay down and...

226
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,405
No, no, no.
I'll... I'll take a cab.

227
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,082
Just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

228
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:04,841
I just can't.
I promised Simon I'd find him a model.

229
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:08,344
Carl, take me off the speaker.
Did I tell you that these are house seats?

230
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,056
Come on.
You could use a break.

231
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,808
Hello?
Carl?

232
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,144
You there?

233
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,148
Hello? Okay.
I just found a model.

234
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,692
Hey, boys.

235
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,945
Hey, look. I know this guy.
He even bought me dinner. Hey!

236
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,947
Carl, right?

237
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,911
Hey.
What's goin' on?

238
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:37,082
- Hey. Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

239
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,960
You picked me up, maybe a few
weeks, I don't know, some time ago.

240
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:43,139
But this is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

241
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,664
Portrait?

242
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:49,886
Come here. I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

243
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:54,390
Brad Pitt is the shit.
Do you read?

244
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,815
Who is it, baby?

245
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:08,071
Who is that, Verdell?
Who is that?

246
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,283
I'm sorry.
I told you today.

247
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:16,204
I was out in the studio
doing my work, and I just...

248
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:21,042
It's out here.
You sure have great things.

249
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,086
Gershwin.
He's great, isn't he?

250
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,632
I usually make such a big deal about
pickin' models, but Carl is so thorough.

251
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,884
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé?

252
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,850
This is not a nude.

253
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,353
Just kiddin' around.

254
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,983
So much for love.

255
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,944
And yet another pose.

256
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,031
Exactly what is your previous experience?
How 'bout that?

257
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,410
I'm runnin' out of ideas here.

258
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,665
Well, then give me some direction, okay?

259
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:05,295
Nothing.
I just watch until something, strikes me.

260
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:08,006
I mean, do, do anything
that you think of.

261
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,008
Wait for me to say, "Hold that pose,"

262
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:13,052
and then just try to...
comfortably hold it.

263
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,765
No direction.

264
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,811
Okay.

265
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:25,106
What I do is I watch.

266
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,193
You ever watch somebody who doesn't
know that you're watching them?

267
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,654
An old woman...
sitting on a bus,

268
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,366
or kids going to school
or somebody just waiting?

269
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:39,078
And you see this flash come over them,

270
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:43,041
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external,

271
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,084
because that hasn't changed.

272
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:50,256
And when you see it, they're just sort
of "realer" and they're more alive.

273
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:54,802
I mean, you look at someone long
enough, you discover their humanity.

274
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,394
No, no.
I know exactly what you mean.

275
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,985
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

276
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,368
- Hey, look out.
- Excuse me.

277
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:21,079
Sorry.

278
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:24,332
So I went in, and I got
on the third line of dialogue,

279
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,708
and all of a sudden, I blanked.

280
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,744
I had no clue as to what the next line was.

281
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:32,023
Ignores me.
So he said to me, "Last chance."

282
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,092
Last chance.
Oh, God.

283
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:37,595
- So I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

284
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,390
I messed up in the exact same line.

285
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,517
I know, but guess what?

286
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:45,103
What?
He cast me!

287
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,563
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

288
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,817
Okay, okay, okay.

289
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:59,701
Can't live without me?

290
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:06,457
I'm finally gonna ask. All right,
what's with the plastic picnic wear?

291
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,127
Why don't you try ours?
Are you afraid it isn't clean?

292
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,129
You okay?
Yep.

293
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,464
Well, I see the help.
It's a judgment call.

294
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,010
So give yourself a little pep talk:

295
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:19,429
"Must try other people's
clean silverware...

296
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:22,140
as part of the fun
of dining out."

297
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,476
What's wrong with your son?

298
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,230
What do you care?

299
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,743
He's got to fight to breathe.
His asthma can just shoot off the charts.

300
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,495
He's allergic to dust,
and this is New York,

301
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,791
so his immune system bails on him whenever
there's trouble, so an ear infectio...

302
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:50,752
Is this bothering you?

303
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,546
No.

304
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:58,843
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to the
emergency room five, six times a month,

305
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:02,347
where I get whatever nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

306
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:04,390
Nice chatting with you.

307
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:08,102
His name?

308
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:12,940
- Spencer.
- Okay.

309
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,278
Spence.

310
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:26,621
Puppy. It's okay. Go on. Go on.

311
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,092
You can put on anything you want now.
I might be sort of done here.

312
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:42,637
I been comin' here for two weeks,
and all we've done is work. Let's play!

313
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:47,850
Vincent!

314
00:23:57,694 --> 00:24:00,375
So, you're practically finished?

315
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:04,826
Yeah.
There is one more stage.

316
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:14,836
- Where ya goin'?
- No place. I was just gonna sneak a peek.

317
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:28,266
Verdell!

318
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,852
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- No. He's not allowed.

319
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:35,982
Wait, I gotta take off.
Do you wanna say good-bye or anything?

320
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:40,278
Yeah! He's just gotta go.
One second. No, wait.

321
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:43,698
I'm gonna
look at the painting, all right?

322
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:50,246
Where you goin', sweetheart?
Verdell?

323
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:54,417
Want some water?
What is the matter with you?

324
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,711
Come on.
You want some water?

325
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,801
Simon, wait!

326
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,222
Yo.

327
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:17,565
Why are you doing this?

328
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:22,195
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

329
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,323
See, man, that painting in there...

330
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:27,366
What are you doing, cruisin' him?

331
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,169
Excuse me.

332
00:25:38,295 --> 00:25:42,298
- Help me!
- No, we gotta go.

333
00:25:42,424 --> 00:25:44,800
Come on, come on, come on.

334
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,817
Okay, so you call 911
and don't leave your name?

335
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,642
That's right.
Yes.

336
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:05,446
Even a dumb geezer should know that
emergency... Just move on. No one killed.

337
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,282
- Is he dead?
- Ask him.

338
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:12,578
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't bark at me. I didn't name ya.

339
00:26:12,663 --> 00:26:15,122
We will.
And if we can't,

340
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,750
we'll come back and ask
you again and again.

341
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,920
Hey. What, are you tryin' to
intimidate me with that attitude?

342
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:24,840
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

343
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:26,953
Go shake down a 7...
Eleven for a day-old wiener.

344
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:28,636
They want you inside, sir.

345
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:32,056
Just a matter of time, sir. There's
a painting of one of the guys in here.

346
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,809
Get some tape on it.

347
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,563
I've been praying for him since I heard.

348
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:41,315
So, anyway, I'm
on my way to the hospital.

349
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,985
If you could just watch the dog.
Just for tonight.

350
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:45,987
Oh, no, no, no.
No?

351
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:48,739
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
Okay. Thanks.

352
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:53,536
Old bitch!
Damn dog!

353
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,002
You're takin' him.
Yes! Yes, you are!

354
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:04,589
Get the hell out of the way!
You're takin' him.

355
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,591
This will even the books.
One night.

356
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,385
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

357
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:11,846
You want to say "no" to me?

358
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,099
You want to say "no" to me?

359
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:18,728
You want to say "no" to me?

360
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:21,105
I don't wanna say nothin' to you.

361
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:26,110
Because I've never felt this crazy
as I do right now.

362
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,696
I almost... I almost want you to say "no".

363
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:37,913
- Thanks for lookin' after him.
- Hey. Where ya goin'?

364
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,126
You can't do this!
You don't want to mess with me today!

365
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,504
I can't take a dog!
Nobody's ever been in here before!

366
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:48,758
Hey, Frank!

367
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,801
Frank?

368
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,512
Hey, Frank!
Frank!

369
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:20,581
Three, four, five.

370
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,769
You're dead.

371
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:46,857
Well, we don't have no dog food here;
we don't want no dog food here.

372
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,568
You'll eat what we got!
What we eat!

373
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:54,907
All right.

374
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,956
Don't you do anything!

375
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,890
Where's the trust?

376
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,819
Never a break.
Never.

377
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,071
Dogs!

378
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:47,126
<i>Always look at the
bright side of your life</i>

379
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,009
<i>Always look at the lighter
side of your life...</i>

380
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,937
God!

381
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:10,515
Well, we're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

382
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,167
and we haven't sold a single painting!

383
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,495
No, we can't reduce the price
at this stage! Sir, please.

384
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:16,964
I'm in a free fall here.

385
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,908
Yes?
We can see him.

386
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:22,036
Okay.
I'll meet you in there.

387
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,122
I will meet...
you in there, okay?

388
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,333
One minute.

389
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:29,376
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

390
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,714
How ya doin', great one?

391
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,008
I haven't looked at myself yet.

392
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,385
I figured I could tell
from your reaction.

393
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,390
That bad?

394
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,976
Okay.
I talked to the doctor, and...

395
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:52,024
Okay, it's, it's not that bad.

396
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:55,508
I talked to the doctors, and they say you're
gonna be your old self in a couple weeks.

397
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,825
I mean, the scars here might
take a little... Oh, shit!

398
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:07,373
- Oh, Simon.
- Jackie?

399
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:10,709
- Yes?
- Can you hand me a mirror, please?

400
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:12,711
No.

401
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:22,221
Wait.
I have a smaller one.

402
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,020
Okay.

403
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:36,694
So, how are things, anyway?

404
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,906
- How is Verdell?
- Your neighbor, Mr. Udall,

405
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:42,867
taking care of him.

406
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,494
How could you do that?

407
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,372
He'll hurt him.
No, Simon. I promise.

408
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:50,416
Not a chance!

409
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,554
I own this guy!
Besides, there was nobody else.

410
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,379
You know, I'm always on the move, and...

411
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,423
Trust me.

412
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:02,219
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

413
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,430
Yes, your dog is fine, Simon.

414
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:08,642
Okay.

415
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:13,147
Waiting gives the devil time.

416
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,000
Oh, my.

417
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:46,764
Where'd I go?

418
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,168
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

419
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:53,103
He's so calm!
What are you doing with a dog?

420
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,067
Suckered in, set up, pushed around.

421
00:32:58,151 --> 00:33:00,444
You're not worried someone might take it?

422
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:06,241
No, not until now, for Christ sake.

423
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:08,535
Sorry.
I'm gonna sit here.

424
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:14,375
Hey, puppy!
He's cute!

425
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,669
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

426
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,129
I wonder what breed he is?

427
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,345
You know, he's a little dog.

428
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:29,556
Next time, if Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

429
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,643
How old are you?

430
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,354
If I was gonna guess by your eyes,

431
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,940
I'd say you were 50.

432
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:40,401
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

433
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,321
So, so much for eyes, but as long as
you bring up age, how old are you?

434
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:47,282
Oh, no, no. I mean, not... in other
words... Well, you brought it up.

435
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:49,952
Not that you're ugly;
that's not what I'm saying.

436
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,413
Easy, easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

437
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:57,042
But my knees start knockin' when
you turn on the charm full blast.

438
00:33:57,127 --> 00:34:01,005
No, but I mean, what's with the dark?

439
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,592
Dawn patrol.

440
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:09,638
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

441
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:14,018
And this time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

442
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,729
So I get him home...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

443
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:21,358
The dog.
It's bacon for the... Bacon's for the...

444
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:23,527
for the dog.

445
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:28,449
Last week, I was playin' the piano
for him, and he likes it.

446
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,452
So I decide I'm gonna...

447
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:35,539
...make a little joke.
So, you're all set here?

448
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:47,092
I think it's a beautiful
day for our walk today.

449
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:49,136
Very nice.

450
00:34:56,811 --> 00:35:00,105
Hey!
Hey!

451
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,901
Look at that!
Look at him!

452
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:09,281
I gotta give you somethin'.
I gotta give you somethin' real good too.

453
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:13,327
I'm gonna show it to ya.
Come on, buddy.

454
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,414
Don't be like me.
Don't you be like me.

455
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:20,459
You stay just the way you are,
'cause you are a perfect man,

456
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:23,420
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you somethin' to eat.

457
00:35:23,546 --> 00:35:26,340
What you love, you hear me?

458
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:29,760
I'd like to be treated like that.
I'm gonna take you home right now...

459
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:32,137
and get you some... Yes!

460
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:34,389
Let's go home and do some writing.

461
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,768
"He had made the girl happy.

462
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:40,854
"And what a girl!

463
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,273
"'You saved my life, ' she said.

464
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:47,986
'You'd better make it
up to me."'

465
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:54,118
Done!

466
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:58,122
Done! Yes, I hate the doggie.
Yes, I hate the doggie!

467
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,624
62 books!

468
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,835
Done!

469
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,379
We have to cut back
expenses every place we can.

470
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,422
He has no medical insurance?

471
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:10,592
No. Let me see.
These are the food receipts.

472
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:13,554
Yeah.
Here are the household expenses.

473
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,597
Here's one for the dog again.

474
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,475
I can read it. I got it.
I can't see it.

475
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,228
And all the laundry and the cleaners.
Okay, good.

476
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,274
Boy, look at that!

477
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,484
He likes it.

478
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,321
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

479
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,949
What are you comin' over here for?
I told you to sit here.

480
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,155
I can't cook with a dog near me.

481
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:39,746
Okay, just sit. Good.
We don't want any company.

482
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,167
I'll read you a little Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Okay. Have it your way.

483
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:54,011
- Hey.
- Hey.

484
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,889
How's Verdell doin'?

485
00:36:56,973 --> 00:37:00,184
Ah, you know, he's a pain in the ass.

486
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:05,105
Well... Simon's home.

487
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,900
I was sort of hoping
you can keep the dog...

488
00:37:07,984 --> 00:37:10,611
until he's had a chance
to think and adjust.

489
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:14,781
Well, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

490
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,034
No, no.
He definitely wants him back right away.

491
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:20,078
He'll be by tomorrow.

492
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:23,957
Okay.

493
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:27,169
Okay by me.

494
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,760
Hungry?
Be right with you, pooch.

495
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,267
One, two, three...

496
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:45,312
four, five.

497
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:49,441
One, two, three, four.

498
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:54,655
I'm okay.

499
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,629
Okay.

500
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:24,434
Three.

501
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:40,867
Mr. Udall?

502
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,794
Some face they left hangin' on ya.
You look like...

503
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:53,046
Would you take it...

504
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,632
just...

505
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,218
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

506
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:04,349
Thank you.

507
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:07,686
Verdell?

508
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,816
Come here, my beautiful boy!

509
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,860
Come here!
Come here, boy!

510
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,154
Let's go home and get well.

511
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,533
Ah, you can't blame him for being weird.

512
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:25,871
Have a look at yourself in the mirror.

513
00:39:28,124 --> 00:39:31,001
Thank you.

514
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:37,341
Come on, sweetheart!

515
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:40,969
Verdell? Come here.
Come here, boy.

516
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:46,183
I know what you want.

517
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:50,270
Come on!

518
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,439
Where's my boy?

519
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,529
No.
Don't force him.

520
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:35,357
Over a dog!

521
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,821
Over an ugly dog!

522
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,206
Worst sidewalk in New York.

523
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,126
Look where they put it.

524
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,008
Hi.
Help!

525
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,470
If you want to see me, you will not do this.
You will make an appointment.

526
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:09,391
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

527
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:12,102
and then act as though I had
some choice about barging in.

528
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,855
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

529
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,817
You said you could help me!
What was that? A tease?

530
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:22,571
I can help you if you take
responsibility to keep regular appoint...

531
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:25,615
You changed the room around.
Two years ago.

532
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,744
I also regrew my beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

533
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:32,851
So it's like I always...
I don't have this mountain of available time.

534
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,624
I have to get to my restaurant on time.

535
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,252
Now, do you know how hard
it was for me to come here?

536
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,963
Yes.
Thank you.

537
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,716
No, we're not doing this now.

538
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,971
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

539
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:50,557
No.
Nope.

540
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:02,486
What if this is as good as it gets?

541
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,835
What the heck are those for?

542
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:23,924
No, no, no.
Get Carol.

543
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,677
I'm fillin' in.
We don't know if she's comin' back.

544
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:30,764
You know, I think she might be
getting a job closer to home.

545
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,019
- Why plastic?
- What are you tryin' to do to me?

546
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,438
What the heck do you mean?

547
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:44,361
Look, elephant girl, just...
just go get Carol or something.

548
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:47,197
Just have her do my one meal here.
I...

549
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:49,783
You know, I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

550
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:54,955
Do it!

551
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,585
- Bryan. Bryan. Code blue. Bryan.
- Oh, no.

552
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:09,386
Out!
Just shut up and get out!

553
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,721
Do it!

554
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,974
I'll be quiet.

555
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:19,229
Just let me stay here. I'll... No problem.
Go get Carol.

556
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:22,440
Get her here.

557
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:26,403
I'm not a... prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

558
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,530
I'm a great customer.

559
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:29,906
This day...

560
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:32,200
has been a disaster.

561
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:38,081
- I'm not sure if I can... handle this too.
- Get out!

562
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:42,961
Get out immediately,
or there's gonna be trouble.

563
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:45,088
Man, I mean it.

564
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:55,515
Okay.

565
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:03,356
See ya!
Bye!

566
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,943
It's about time!

567
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:11,531
Carol's last name?
Connelly.

568
00:44:11,657 --> 00:44:13,658
Thank you.

569
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:16,578
Hey, Dad! Dad!
I'm over here!

570
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,126
Does he visit often?
No, not really. Not anymore.

571
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,211
What can you do?

572
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,555
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

573
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,599
Why not?
You're a good girl.

574
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:39,601
Hello.

575
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:56,326
Christ!

576
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,763
I'm hungry.

577
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:21,393
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

578
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:25,188
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing.

579
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:27,334
If you were a waiter, I'd...
Are you totally gone?

580
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,959
This is my private home!

581
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,989
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this,

582
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,617
even though it's
an important issue to me.

583
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:41,037
And I have very strong
feelings on the subject.

584
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:45,542
What subject? That I wasn't there to
take crap from you and bring you eggs?

585
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:48,920
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

586
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:57,637
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

587
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:03,977
And to prove it, I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

588
00:46:05,688 --> 00:46:08,064
Why aren't you at work?

589
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:09,983
You sick?

590
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,404
You don't look sick.

591
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:18,158
Just tired and bitter.

592
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:24,038
My son is sick, okay?

593
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,668
What about your mother?

594
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:32,464
How do you know about my mother?

595
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,217
I hear you talking while I wait.

596
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:39,763
Mom, I finished my juice.
I'm sorry, honey. One sec.

597
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:42,307
Mom?

598
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:50,940
How ya doin'?

599
00:46:57,865 --> 00:47:00,283
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

600
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,787
I'm sorry, Melvin. That's it. I cannot
handle you teaching my son manners!

601
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:05,288
Ow!

602
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,918
Back to life.

603
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:19,719
What's wrong?

604
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,807
Five one-thousand, four one-thousand,

605
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:28,478
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand, bingo.

606
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:33,274
104.9. We're gonna treat
ourselves to a cab ride.

607
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:37,946
Look out, you guys.
Coming through.

608
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,490
Look out.

609
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:42,742
Look out, you guys.
What's wrong?

610
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:45,161
We're okay.
We're okay.

611
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:47,413
Melvin!

612
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,667
Wait!

613
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:53,211
Melvin, wait!
Melvin, wait!

614
00:47:53,295 --> 00:47:58,424
Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!
Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!

615
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,343
Shut up, kids!

616
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,597
Give us a lift, would you, Melvin?

617
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,891
A lift.
Okay.

618
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,938
Cover your mouth when you cough, kid.

619
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:18,987
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please.
And quickly, please!

620
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:21,072
Hospital?
Yes.

621
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:24,200
Any chance you'll be back at work today?
No!

622
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:26,494
Stay away from me!
God!

623
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:33,751
Simon, we can't put this off any longer.

624
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:36,588
I feel terrible that I have to...

625
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:38,590
Simon.

626
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:42,218
Simon, could you just
leave the dog for a second?

627
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:45,555
Sorry.

628
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:50,810
What are those cards?

629
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:54,230
Frank's idea. He thought I should
have notes so I did this right.

630
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:58,651
Maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

631
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:04,115
See, he's right.
I need the cards.

632
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:11,789
"Simon, you're broke.

633
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:19,255
The medical bills are 61,000 now,
and the show didn't go well."

634
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,177
I've spoken to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

635
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,764
But... they said they would
feel strange about calling you.

636
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:31,142
Well, I can't call them.

637
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:36,522
Come here, baby.

638
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,525
Verdell!
What's wrong?

639
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:43,029
You miss the tough guy?

640
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,281
Well, here I am, sweetheart.

641
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:47,533
Happy to see me, you little pissant mop?

642
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,453
How 'bout another ride down the chute?

643
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:52,977
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I did not mean that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

644
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,166
Simon?
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

645
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,126
Simon!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

646
00:49:59,254 --> 00:50:03,216
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

647
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:12,225
Oh, my God.

648
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:44,507
Yes, you write more than everybody else.
Yes, you make us a lot of money.

649
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,913
But I think it's more appropriate
for you... Look. Look.

650
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,055
I need this.
Just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

651
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,267
Okay?

652
00:50:54,393 --> 00:50:57,020
Melvin, I'll try.

653
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,605
Thank you.
That's good.

654
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,193
Now, on a pleasanter note, my son,
he just got accepted to Brown.

655
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:07,030
My husband was dying.

656
00:51:07,114 --> 00:51:10,575
Yeah. Good. Nice.
Thrilled. Exciting...

657
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:13,119
You don't have to wait with me.

658
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:23,838
I can't resist.
You usually move through here so quickly,

659
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:27,467
and I just have so many
questions I wanna ask you.

660
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,137
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

661
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,139
What does it mean to you?

662
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:37,477
That somebody out there
knows what it's like...

663
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,562
to be in here.

664
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:43,274
Oh, God.
This is like a nightmare.

665
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:48,071
Come on. Just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

666
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:53,409
How do you write women so well?

667
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:58,748
I think of a man, and I take
away reason and accountability.

668
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,855
M.D.

669
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:30,738
What's wrong?

670
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:33,533
Mom!
In here, Mrs. Connelly.

671
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,535
- What? What?
- Hi.

672
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,703
- Please, what? Just tell me.
- I'm Martin...

673
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,540
- What? Please, just tell me.
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.

674
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,960
Not your name! What are you telling
me your name for? Where is he?

675
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,671
- He's in the bathroom.
- Hey.

676
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:48,475
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

677
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:51,033
Do you know there are doctors
come to your house? No, I didn't.

678
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:53,511
So, what are you doing here?
Well...

679
00:52:53,595 --> 00:52:55,930
I didn't know that you
had a secret admirer.

680
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:57,974
What?
You met the gift.

681
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:02,228
He's good.
I'm an expert on doctors.

682
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,564
Okay, Doctor.

683
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:09,152
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

684
00:53:09,236 --> 00:53:11,320
She said I was to take excellent care...

685
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:14,157
of this little guy because you are
urgently needed back at work.

686
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,326
That's what she told me.
What... What kind of work do you do?

687
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:21,038
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

688
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:23,499
Dr. Bettes?

689
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:27,670
Yeah, Terry... Excuse me.

690
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:30,756
Hi, I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

691
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,301
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

692
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:36,846
Tell 'em I need C.B.C., differential,
platelets, the whole thing. Okay.

693
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:39,849
And I want it back today.
Ha! I'm sorry.

694
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:42,018
Did you say you're gonna get
the results back today?

695
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:45,938
Sure.
Let's sit down.

696
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,940
These are the receipts,

697
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:51,527
from all the prescriptions
from the beginning of the year.

698
00:53:51,653 --> 00:53:54,363
Don't forget the calendar. Yeah, yeah.
And this is a calendar...

699
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:59,327
of days and how he felt
and what he's been eating.

700
00:53:59,411 --> 00:54:02,830
That's very good.
How long has he had the problem?

701
00:54:02,915 --> 00:54:05,583
Since forever.
Six months old. Okay.

702
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,502
And have they done blood tests on him?
Yeah.

703
00:54:08,629 --> 00:54:12,131
Only in the emergency room, or when he was well?
Emergency room only.

704
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:14,842
Okay, and how about skin
testing for allergies?

705
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:18,346
No. No standard scratch test?
They poke 'em with a needle.

706
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:23,559
No, I asked. They said my plan didn't cover
it and that it wasn't necessary anyways.

707
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:26,229
- Why, should they have?
- Well...

708
00:54:26,355 --> 00:54:29,649
Fucking H.M.O. bastard pieces of shit!
Carol.

709
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,538
I'm sorry.

710
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:34,963
It's okay. Actually, I think
that's their technical name.

711
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:40,243
So, once the tests come back,
is there someone...

712
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,828
in your office we should talk
to to get the results, or...

713
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:46,958
Me.
My home number's on the card.

714
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:49,460
That's his home number.

715
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,179
- What?
- It's your home...

716
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:02,765
Ha.

717
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:05,309
Can we get you anything else?

718
00:55:05,394 --> 00:55:09,397
- Do you want some water or some coffee?
- No, thank you.

719
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:12,608
A couple of female slaves?

720
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:16,529
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do,

721
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,531
a lot of things I have to find out here.

722
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,783
But look, whatever I find out,

723
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:22,994
I promise you at the very least
from now on...

724
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:26,706
your son is gonna feel
a great deal better, okay?

725
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,216
Doc.

726
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:46,392
No... Fine.
Okay. Okay, that's good.

727
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,895
That's good.

728
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:54,483
So, listen, you gotta let me
know about the additional costs.

729
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,131
One way or another we'll...

730
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:58,556
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

731
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:04,618
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

732
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,249
That's wonderful.

733
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:18,007
Anyway, dear, thank
you for everything, Nora.

734
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:22,094
Forgive my recent crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track, okay?

735
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:28,642
Ah.

736
00:56:29,895 --> 00:56:32,730
!Hijole!
What's wrong?

737
00:56:32,814 --> 00:56:34,982
Who's gonna walk Verdell?

738
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,193
Oh, no!

739
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:39,612
No!

740
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:58,631
Is he dead yet?
No.

741
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,801
Would there be any way...

742
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:06,097
that you would be willing
to walk his dog for him?

743
00:57:06,181 --> 00:57:08,224
Absolutely.

744
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:10,810
You're a wonderful man.

745
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,275
2:00 would be a good time,
and here is the key...

746
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,195
in case he is asleep.

747
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:23,614
Open his curtains for him...

748
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:26,492
so he can see God's beautiful work.

749
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,702
And he'll know that...

750
00:57:28,787 --> 00:57:31,247
even things like this
happen for the best.

751
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:33,916
Where did they teach you
to talk like this?

752
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,919
In some Panama City sailor
"wanna hump-hump" bar?

753
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:39,922
Or is this getaway day and
your last shot at his whiskey?

754
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:43,676
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

755
00:57:53,353 --> 00:57:56,939
No, no! There is a seriously
goofy man behind this!

756
00:57:57,065 --> 00:57:59,645
You're not allowed to block out that fact!
Do you really want...

757
00:57:59,668 --> 00:58:04,505
to go back to emergency where those runt
doctors keep telling us that they can't help?

758
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:08,325
This lets a crazy man into our lives.
Let's not fight.

759
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,954
You know how this will turn out.
Come on!

760
00:58:12,038 --> 00:58:15,458
You know how this will turn out.

761
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,669
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

762
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:21,130
You don't send this one back.

763
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:27,761
Right?

764
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,270
No, I do.
I understand.

765
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:38,898
All right, listen.
I gotta go, okay?

766
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,027
No, okay.

767
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:43,655
Bye-bye.

768
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:54,705
What a day.
Come here, come here.

769
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:57,791
Hey, maybe I'll bring him some food by.

770
00:58:57,918 --> 00:59:01,378
Thank you for walking him.

771
00:59:01,463 --> 00:59:05,341
If you'll excuse
me, I'm not feeling so well.

772
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:08,344
Yeah, this place smells like shit.

773
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:11,013
Go away.

774
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:13,682
What, this...
this cleaning lady doesn't...

775
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,185
Please, just leave!

776
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:20,105
What happened
to your queer party friends?

777
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,774
Get outta here!

778
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:31,033
Nothing worse than having to
feel this way in front of you.

779
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:34,745
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.

780
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,377
Rot in hell, Melvin.

781
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:44,880
No need to stop bein' a lady.
Quit worryin'.

782
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:48,050
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

783
00:59:56,977 --> 01:00:00,229
Is this fun for you?

784
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:04,233
Well, you lucky devil, it just keeps
gettin' better and better, doesn't it?

785
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:08,237
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin,
and Frank, he wants me...

786
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:13,284
to beg my parents... who haven't
called me... for help, and I won't.

787
01:00:13,368 --> 01:00:18,080
And I don't want to paint anymore.

788
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:21,750
So, the life that I was
trying for is over.

789
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:25,087
The life that I had is gone,
and I'm feeling so damn sorry...

790
01:00:25,171 --> 01:00:28,257
for myself that it's difficult to breathe.

791
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,843
It's high times for you,
isn't it, Melvin?

792
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:36,015
The gay neighbor is terrified.
Terrified!

793
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:51,196
I was just trying to give you a boost.

794
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:57,411
Lucky you, you're here for rock bottom.

795
01:00:57,495 --> 01:01:01,373
You absolute horror of a human being.

796
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:18,849
The one thing I'll do for you.
I, might cheer you up.

797
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:20,476
Get out.

798
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:24,772
You wanna know why that dog prefers me?

799
01:01:24,856 --> 01:01:28,525
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

800
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:34,156
I keep bacon in my pocket.

801
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,116
See?

802
01:01:36,242 --> 01:01:40,704
Oh, my gosh.

803
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:49,213
We'll both call him.
You'll see. It's a... trick.

804
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:51,382
Okay?

805
01:01:56,096 --> 01:01:58,847
Come here, Verdell.

806
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:03,477
Come here.

807
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:07,189
- Yo, yo.
- Come on.

808
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:09,358
Come here.

809
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:11,902
Come here, baby.
No.

810
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,363
It's okay. Come here.

811
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:20,035
Just a stupid, stupid dog.

812
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:24,123
Could you leave now?

813
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:28,293
Please.

814
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:33,549
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

815
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,686
Taxi!

816
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,159
Sorry.

817
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,094
Again with Nick
at Nite's Classic TV Rewind.

818
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:03,180
On repeat viewing,

819
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:07,810
one begins to suspect that might not really
be Major Healey in the phone booth after all.

820
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:10,312
Mr. Udall?

821
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:13,373
A second look at shows
that are always worth a second look.

822
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:15,150
- Carol, the waitress?
- Yes.

823
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,118
Hi.

824
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:29,331
The doctors gave me your billing address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

825
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:40,384
If you're...

826
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:46,306
If you're, worried about thanking me...

827
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:49,059
That's not why I'm here.

828
01:04:49,143 --> 01:04:52,729
Though you have no idea what it's
like to have a real conversation...

829
01:04:52,814 --> 01:04:55,440
with a doctor about Spencer.

830
01:04:57,068 --> 01:05:00,779
Note... Put it in a note.

831
01:05:07,787 --> 01:05:10,372
So, I have...

832
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:13,876
I have a hair dryer...

833
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,378
Why did you do this for me?

834
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,717
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

835
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:26,388
Do have some idea
how strange that sounds?

836
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:29,766
Well, I mean...
I'm worried you did this be...

837
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:50,162
Are you waiting for me to say something?

838
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,834
Look,

839
01:05:57,128 --> 01:06:00,130
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

840
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:05,093
I don't think this can wait until tomorrow.
I need to clear this up now.

841
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,095
Clear what up?

842
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,642
I'm not going to sleep with you.

843
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:14,603
I will never sleep with you.
Never, ever.

844
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:18,106
Not ever.

845
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,529
Well.

846
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:28,825
I'm sorry, but...

847
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:32,663
we don't open for the no-sex
oaths until 9:00 a.m.

848
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,041
I'm not kidding.

849
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,211
Anything else?

850
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,549
Just...

851
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:48,762
thank you.

852
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:55,018
So, you'll be at work tomorrow?

853
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:01,566
Yes.

854
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:19,793
"Never," she said.
"Never," she says.

855
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:41,690
I took a chan...
took a chance you were up.

856
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:45,527
I brought you some Chinese soup.

857
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:49,364
Thanks.

858
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,173
Boy.

859
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:08,967
I've never been this tired in my life.

860
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:18,810
I haven't been sleepin'.

861
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:24,232
I haven't been clear in my head...

862
01:08:24,317 --> 01:08:26,777
or felt like myself.

863
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,781
I'm in trouble.

864
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:35,619
It's not just the tiredness.

865
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:39,456
Boy. It's sick.
Nauseous.

866
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,500
Sleepy.

867
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,752
Where everything looks distorted,

868
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:47,339
and everything inside
just kind of aches...

869
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:50,467
and you can barely find
the will to complain.

870
01:08:50,551 --> 01:08:53,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

871
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:58,850
I'm glad we did this.

872
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:02,604
Good talking to you.

873
01:09:10,696 --> 01:09:13,448
You are not still writing
that thank... you note?

874
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:17,202
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

875
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:21,164
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

876
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:26,461
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

877
01:09:26,546 --> 01:09:28,880
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

878
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:32,425
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

879
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:36,805
You better start finding something
else to do with your free time.

880
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:39,474
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

881
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:42,144
All right.
We got pizza!

882
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:44,396
Carol and I are going out.

883
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,607
Sausage, pepperoni. You wanna make
this later for you and Spencer?

884
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:52,404
Great.
We are goin' out like people do.

885
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,243
If you can't feel good about this break...

886
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,205
and step out a little, then I...

887
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:07,586
I think you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

888
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,589
I don't need one, 'cause I know
what's really going on here!

889
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:15,010
I gotta finish this letter,
or I'll go nuts.

890
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:19,347
- Carol...
- This can't be right. "Con-science"?

891
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,391
Carol?

892
01:10:25,146 --> 01:10:27,105
What?

893
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:47,792
It's very weird now, not feeling that...

894
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,795
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

895
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:56,051
Without that, I just start
thinking about myself, and...

896
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:59,304
what good does that ever get anybody?

897
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:06,603
Today, on the bus, there
was this adorable couple,

898
01:11:06,687 --> 01:11:09,731
and I felt myself...

899
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:12,943
giving 'em a dirty look.

900
01:11:14,987 --> 01:11:20,408
I just had no idea everything was...

901
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,501
Go ahead.

902
01:11:31,963 --> 01:11:34,839
Moving in the wrong direction...

903
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:39,302
away from a time when I
remembered what it was like...

904
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:42,389
to have a man to anything.

905
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:44,891
Hold, fucking...

906
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:48,186
Sorry... No, it's okay.

907
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:51,982
Hands with, for Christ sake!

908
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:53,984
And...

909
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:57,612
I felt almost...

910
01:11:57,697 --> 01:12:01,157
really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.

911
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:08,206
Which is probably why I make poor
Spencer hug me more than he wants to.

912
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:13,044
The poor kid doesn't have
enough problems.

913
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,131
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

914
01:12:20,177 --> 01:12:22,554
Who needs these thoughts?

915
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:25,851
So, what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

916
01:12:25,876 --> 01:12:27,076
Leave me be!

917
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:31,813
Why are you doing this?
What is it you want?

918
01:12:31,897 --> 01:12:34,140
I hope getting me thinking
about everything that's wrong,

919
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:38,370
when all I want to do is
not do that, has some purpose.

920
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:42,157
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

921
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:44,159
What?

922
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:46,578
I want us to go out.

923
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:57,213
Okay.

924
01:12:57,298 --> 01:13:00,133
Like spiral curls and barrel
curls and everything like that.

925
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:03,928
I gotta go, Jimbo. I'll see ya.
Take care, babe.

926
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:07,515
Because I love you.

927
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,560
You know, it's got those big
windows, and there's lots of light.

928
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:12,729
Yeah, I don't know where my wife is.

929
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:20,487
Thank you. Now, I gotta
send you a thank-you note.

930
01:13:22,573 --> 01:13:26,701
Look, Evelyn's here, and her giant Joey.

931
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:29,371
Beverly!

932
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:32,306
That's why you brought me here.
That's really why you brought me here.

933
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:34,626
Well, you know, it's not even mine.

934
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,837
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

935
01:13:37,922 --> 01:13:42,050
But the dog did throw up twice
last night and his spark is off.

936
01:13:42,176 --> 01:13:45,053
Well, take him to the vet.
I did.

937
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:49,265
They say his stomach's out of whack and
they need him for a couple of days.

938
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,975
Well, do it.
What d...

939
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,813
Sorry.
Excuse me.

940
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,732
Okay.
Now, this is for later.

941
01:13:57,817 --> 01:14:01,111
- What's this?
- It's a note.

942
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:05,740
- A note?
- Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

943
01:14:05,825 --> 01:14:07,951
Thank-you note?
No, no, no.

944
01:14:08,035 --> 01:14:10,578
- You can read it later.
- No. No, thank you.

945
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:13,498
No. No, thank you.
No, no, no, no.

946
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,500
No.

947
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,337
Thank you.
Thank you.

948
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:25,343
She's nice.

949
01:14:26,846 --> 01:14:29,222
Yeah.
Real nice?

950
01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:31,558
Really nice.

951
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:38,440
Shouldn't that be a good thing, telling
somebody, "No thanks required"?

952
01:14:38,524 --> 01:14:39,774
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

953
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:44,112
Sure looks like it went over too.

954
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:47,323
I mean... look at you!

955
01:14:49,201 --> 01:14:53,496
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup last night.

956
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:01,921
- What?
- Look at you. You think I'm a mark.

957
01:15:02,006 --> 01:15:04,382
You helped with the dog.
Now, there's other things.

958
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:07,260
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

959
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:10,472
Concerned?
It's not just financial assistance.

960
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:13,683
He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

961
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,977
Yeah, well, yeah.

962
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:19,439
I mean, if his parents are alive,
they have to help. It's the rules.

963
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:23,818
Good. That's great. Let them help him.
Absolutely.

964
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:27,238
Only,

965
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:31,993
I got a high-maintenance selling
painter coming through, so I'm out.

966
01:15:32,077 --> 01:15:34,162
Can you drive him?

967
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:39,876
Think white and get serious.

968
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,921
Take my car, a convertible?

969
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,882
Do you drive?

970
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:49,010
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

971
01:15:49,094 --> 01:15:51,596
Gettin' loud, gettin' loud.

972
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:56,059
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

973
01:15:56,143 --> 01:15:57,555
I want your life for one minute,

974
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,380
where my big problem is somebody
offers me a free convertible...

975
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:03,608
so I can get out of this city.

976
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:11,115
Go ahead, girl.

977
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,203
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll take him.

978
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:16,875
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

979
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,500
Tomorrow morning, I'll take him.
Okay. I'll take him. Fine.

980
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,670
Okay.
Okay.

981
01:16:23,754 --> 01:16:27,549
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

982
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:31,219
We don't enjoy one another that much.

983
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,559
If there is some mental health
foundation that raises money...

984
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:40,436
for people like you,
please be sure to let me know.

985
01:16:40,521 --> 01:16:43,273
Last-word freak.

986
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:45,233
Bye-bye.
Good luck, lady.

987
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,736
Is he talking to me?
So, anything else?

988
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:50,488
Yeah.

989
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:55,451
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

990
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:58,413
Okay.

991
01:16:58,497 --> 01:17:00,957
Hey.

992
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:04,002
What I did for you...
It's working out?

993
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:10,675
What you did changed my life.

994
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:15,513
No...

995
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:18,141
No thank-you note.

996
01:17:18,225 --> 01:17:21,561
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life,

997
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:26,441
which you won't read, is that somehow...

998
01:17:26,525 --> 01:17:32,071
you have done more for my mother, my
son and me than anybody else ever has.

999
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:37,160
I'm just gonna read you this part of it.

1000
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:41,289
"And that makes you the most
important, surprising,

1001
01:17:41,373 --> 01:17:43,458
"generous person I ever met in my life,

1002
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:46,461
"and that you're gonna be in our prayers,

1003
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:48,463
our daily prayers, forever."

1004
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:50,965
Lovely.

1005
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:53,426
I...

1006
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,471
I also wrote one part...
I'm just gonna say...

1007
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:59,807
I wrote, "I'm sorry."
I w...

1008
01:17:59,892 --> 01:18:05,063
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

1009
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:08,232
when you came over, and you told
my son that he oughta answer back.

1010
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:11,277
So, I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that I...

1011
01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:13,804
I wrote I was sorry for bustin'
you on that and I'm sorry...

1012
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,525
for bustin' in on you that
night when I said I was never...

1013
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,164
I was sorry. And I'm sorry for
every time your food was cold,

1014
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:26,167
and that you had to wait
two seconds for a coffee filler.

1015
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:29,253
And I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant,

1016
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:34,509
the human being that had it in
him to do this thing for us.

1017
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:37,320
I'll just... You know what,
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

1018
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:39,764
Gee...
"I have not been able...

1019
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,308
"to express my gratefulness to you.

1020
01:18:42,393 --> 01:18:46,521
Even as I look at the word 'grateful' now,
it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel."

1021
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:52,568
That's...

1022
01:18:52,653 --> 01:18:55,697
I see it.
Thank you.

1023
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:59,283
Thank you.

1024
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:12,088
Now, I want you to do something for me.

1025
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,266
I'm sorry,
didn't I say, "What?"

1026
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,810
I thought I said, "What?"

1027
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,814
What?

1028
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,233
I want you to go on this trip.

1029
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:34,318
No, sir.

1030
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,404
I can't do this without you.

1031
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:40,867
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff one-eye on me.

1032
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:44,954
I need you to chaperone.
Separate everything but cars.

1033
01:19:45,038 --> 01:19:47,582
You said you liked convertibles.
Now, I'm on the hook.

1034
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:51,377
- I'm sorry, "the stiff one-eye"?
- Two days.

1035
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:53,588
I can't. I work.
You get off when you want to.

1036
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:56,591
My son.
Bettes said he's doing fine.

1037
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,928
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What has that got to do with it?

1038
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:05,016
- Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet.

1039
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,602
I need a hand, and where'd she go?

1040
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:10,521
Are you saying accepting
your help obligates me?

1041
01:20:11,982 --> 01:20:14,525
Is there any other way to see it?

1042
01:20:17,321 --> 01:20:19,363
No.

1043
01:20:25,204 --> 01:20:27,872
Here's a little suitcase...

1044
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,792
shocked that it's being used.

1045
01:20:39,718 --> 01:20:42,512
There's no way to pack for this trip.

1046
01:20:46,225 --> 01:20:48,184
Yeah.

1047
01:21:04,284 --> 01:21:06,202
Hello?

1048
01:21:06,286 --> 01:21:10,164
You're still comin', aren't you?
Yes.

1049
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:13,543
Melvin, I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1050
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:17,171
Just south of Baltimore, Maryland,

1051
01:21:17,256 --> 01:21:19,924
and, I know what you're gonna say next.

1052
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,261
I mean, I think I know.

1053
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:27,974
I'm not... I'm not sure, but I think so.

1054
01:21:28,058 --> 01:21:30,768
There's no need for me
to bring anything dressy?

1055
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:34,272
I mean, I didn't know
if we were gonna be eating...

1056
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,899
in any restaurants that have dress codes?

1057
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,863
Well, I...

1058
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:44,073
I mean, maybe...

1059
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:46,409
I mean, yes!
Yes, let's.

1060
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:49,370
Let's.
Okay, got ya.

1061
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,791
What did you think I was gonna ask?

1062
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:56,544
Whether crabs were in season there now.

1063
01:21:56,628 --> 01:21:59,922
Okay, then.

1064
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:02,216
Good night.

1065
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:08,389
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1066
01:22:08,473 --> 01:22:12,435
No.
Everybody gets their own cage?

1067
01:22:12,519 --> 01:22:13,305
Certainly.

1068
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:15,330
Okay, put him in with that one,
not that one.

1069
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,899
Builds his confidence?
Okay.

1070
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:20,443
Lip kiss.

1071
01:22:20,527 --> 01:22:22,320
Ah!

1072
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:25,948
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1073
01:22:26,033 --> 01:22:28,951
Hey!
Real sensitive.

1074
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:31,287
Bye.

1075
01:22:31,371 --> 01:22:33,831
Call me when you get settled.

1076
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:43,299
Don't worry, Mom!
Have a good time!

1077
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:46,344
No, don't... don't run. Have fun!
Don't worry!

1078
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,554
Don't run. No, no.
Have fun, but don't run.

1079
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,432
Grandma will take care of me!
Bye!

1080
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:58,773
- Sorry I'm not taking you myself, Simon.
- So am I, Frank!

1081
01:22:58,857 --> 01:23:00,775
Give me a hug.

1082
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:05,446
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
Yeah.

1083
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:11,369
Soak it up. It's your last
chance for a hug for a few days.

1084
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,667
Hello?

1085
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,047
Hi.

1086
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:28,678
Hi.
Thank you for being on time.

1087
01:23:30,722 --> 01:23:33,557
Hi.

1088
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:36,060
Carol the waitress, Simon the fag.

1089
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:43,609
Hello.
Holy God, who did that to you?

1090
01:23:45,404 --> 01:23:47,321
I was attacked.

1091
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:51,867
I walked in on some men robbing me and...

1092
01:23:51,952 --> 01:23:57,039
I was hospitalized.
I almost died.

1093
01:23:57,124 --> 01:24:01,210
Let's do the small talk in the car.
Let's go.

1094
01:24:01,294 --> 01:24:05,214
Come on. How are you, sir?
I was gonna do that for you.

1095
01:24:05,298 --> 01:24:07,383
It's all right.
Where should we sit?

1096
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:11,512
I... Well, there's no place cards
or anything. That's all right.

1097
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:15,766
You need all the room you can manage.
So, I'll sit in the back.

1098
01:24:30,282 --> 01:24:33,534
Never a break.
Never.

1099
01:24:33,618 --> 01:24:36,537
I'm sorry. Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

1100
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:41,959
You look like you're crowded in there.
It's all right.

1101
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:46,630
Thanks.

1102
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:55,598
Thank you.

1103
01:24:57,142 --> 01:24:59,101
You're welcome.

1104
01:25:03,982 --> 01:25:06,901
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1105
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:12,865
I'm just kiddin'.

1106
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:18,746
I wanted to see what you'd do.
No, seriously.

1107
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:21,248
We got good stuff here.

1108
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:02,589
Yes, I'm sure, Simon,
they did something really off...

1109
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:07,086
for you to feel this way, but when it
comes to your parents or your kid,

1110
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:11,590
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

1111
01:26:11,675 --> 01:26:16,470
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

1112
01:26:16,555 --> 01:26:19,390
Nonsense, and you wanna know why?

1113
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:22,393
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say raise their hand.

1114
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:36,757
Yes.

1115
01:26:36,783 --> 01:26:38,742
When I was a kid...
Wait, wait, wait.

1116
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:43,497
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

1117
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:51,338
Well, I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

1118
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:55,843
I mean, she was really sort of...
She was sort of fabulous about it actually.

1119
01:26:55,927 --> 01:26:58,804
And she used to...

1120
01:26:58,889 --> 01:27:01,599
You know, I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it,

1121
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:04,852
and she was... she was very natural.

1122
01:27:04,936 --> 01:27:07,730
So she used to pose nude for me.

1123
01:27:09,774 --> 01:27:13,986
And I always thought... or I guess I
assumed... that my father knew about it.

1124
01:27:14,112 --> 01:27:18,157
This stuff is pointless. Hey!
Let him finish, please.

1125
01:27:18,283 --> 01:27:20,910
You like sad stories?
You wanna hear mine? Stop.

1126
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:27,750
Go ahead.
Really, please don't let him stop you.

1127
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:33,005
One day he walked in.
And he found us, and he just...

1128
01:27:33,131 --> 01:27:38,219
He started screaming... My father
didn't come out of his room for 11 years.

1129
01:27:38,303 --> 01:27:41,305
He used to hit me on the hands with
a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1130
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:44,558
playing the piano.

1131
01:27:46,645 --> 01:27:48,812
Go ahead, Simon.

1132
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:52,358
So, you said he came in your
room, and he was yelling?

1133
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:55,819
Please, come on.

1134
01:27:55,946 --> 01:28:00,241
He was...
Come on.

1135
01:28:00,325 --> 01:28:03,244
Yeah, I know...
He was... I was...

1136
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:08,415
I remember I was defending my mother,
and I was trying to, you know,

1137
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,585
make peace in the lamest way.

1138
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:16,799
I said... I said, "She's not naked.
It's art."

1139
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:22,972
And he started hitting me,

1140
01:28:23,056 --> 01:28:26,934
and he... beat me unconscious.

1141
01:28:27,018 --> 01:28:30,271
And he talked to me
less and less after that.

1142
01:28:30,355 --> 01:28:33,482
I mean, he knew what I was before I did.

1143
01:28:33,566 --> 01:28:37,111
And the morning that I left for college,

1144
01:28:37,195 --> 01:28:39,113
he walked into my room.

1145
01:28:39,197 --> 01:28:42,157
And he held out his hand.

1146
01:28:42,242 --> 01:28:45,786
And it was filled with money.

1147
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:50,833
A big... sweaty wad of money.

1148
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:57,798
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1149
01:28:57,882 --> 01:29:02,177
And I just grabbed him, and I hugged him,

1150
01:29:02,262 --> 01:29:04,722
and he turned and walked out.

1151
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:20,195
Hey, we all have these terrible
stories to get over, and you...

1152
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,949
That's not true.
Some of us have great stories,

1153
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:28,162
pretty stories, that take place
at lakes with boats...

1154
01:29:28,246 --> 01:29:31,123
and friends and noodle salad.

1155
01:29:31,207 --> 01:29:36,420
Just no one in this car.
But a lot of people... that's their story.

1156
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:38,672
Good times.
Noodle salad.

1157
01:29:38,757 --> 01:29:43,886
What makes it so hard is not that you had
it bad, but that you're that pissed...

1158
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:46,513
that so many others had it good.

1159
01:29:46,598 --> 01:29:50,893
- No, I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1160
01:29:50,977 --> 01:29:53,896
Not it at all?

1161
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:57,733
Okay.

1162
01:29:57,817 --> 01:30:01,695
Let's, go to the hotel, and,

1163
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:06,742
tomorrow you'll see if you can get another
big wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

1164
01:30:14,918 --> 01:30:19,505
Can I ask you a personal question?

1165
01:30:19,589 --> 01:30:23,133
Sure.

1166
01:30:24,803 --> 01:30:27,471
You ever get an erection over a woman?

1167
01:30:29,182 --> 01:30:30,044
Melvin...

1168
01:30:30,069 --> 01:30:32,669
I mean, wouldn't your life
be easier if you weren't...

1169
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:37,231
You consider your life easy?

1170
01:30:37,315 --> 01:30:40,776
All right.
I give you that one.

1171
01:30:43,988 --> 01:30:45,948
Nice packing.

1172
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:55,791
Hi.

1173
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,001
Hey, Spence!
Hey, Mom.

1174
01:30:58,086 --> 01:31:00,129
Wait till you hear.

1175
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:04,675
Why are you out of breath?
Mom, I ran over a guy and scored a goal.

1176
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:08,637
You did? Yep, he was big.
Charlie, you know!

1177
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:11,765
That's great!
Yep, amazing.

1178
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:13,767
Oh, my God, right?
Yeah.

1179
01:31:13,893 --> 01:31:16,520
Mom, we're playing again.
Gotta go. No, no...

1180
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:18,856
Bye. Wait, wait.
Just tell me...

1181
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:25,195
He scored a goal.
Mom, I don't believe it.

1182
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,489
You would've died.
Yeah.

1183
01:31:29,492 --> 01:31:32,870
My son was outside playing soccer.

1184
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:36,248
Come on.
Take me out for a good time.

1185
01:31:36,332 --> 01:31:38,584
- Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

1186
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:42,337
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1187
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,506
Come on.
No.

1188
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,676
Please, come on. Come on.
No. No.

1189
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:51,472
All right. All right.
You're right. Yeah.

1190
01:31:51,598 --> 01:31:54,057
Are you sad or something?
No. No, no.

1191
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:57,311
I'm nervous.

1192
01:31:57,395 --> 01:32:00,481
It would be very rough,
Carol, if you weren't along.

1193
01:32:00,565 --> 01:32:04,860
What a nice compliment.

1194
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:16,747
I'm happy.

1195
01:32:18,416 --> 01:32:20,501
And you're my date.

1196
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:23,754
Let's get dressed.

1197
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:35,307
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
Okay!

1198
01:32:35,433 --> 01:32:38,602
I'll be right with you.
Okay!

1199
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:17,474
All set?

1200
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:19,476
Yeah.

1201
01:33:21,479 --> 01:33:24,106
- Mr. and Mrs...
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?

1202
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:26,692
- Yes.
- Do they sell hard-shells?

1203
01:33:26,776 --> 01:33:29,319
- Yes.
- Do they?

1204
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:39,413
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1205
01:33:39,539 --> 01:33:43,250
Excuse. Thank you.

1206
01:33:43,334 --> 01:33:47,087
- Good evening.
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?

1207
01:33:47,213 --> 01:33:49,214
Stop asking everyone.
Just him. That's all.

1208
01:33:49,299 --> 01:33:51,592
Okay, you can answer.
We worked it out.

1209
01:33:51,676 --> 01:33:54,261
Yes, we do.

1210
01:33:54,345 --> 01:33:56,189
And, I can give you a tie and jacket.

1211
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,472
What?

1212
01:33:57,473 --> 01:34:00,767
They require a tie and jacket,
but we have some available.

1213
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:13,030
Sir?

1214
01:34:14,073 --> 01:34:17,618
No, I'm not putting that on.

1215
01:34:17,702 --> 01:34:21,788
In case you were gonna ask, I'm also not going
to let you inject me with the plague, either.

1216
01:34:21,914 --> 01:34:26,793
It's such a nice place. You probably have
these dry-cleaned all the time, don't you?

1217
01:34:26,878 --> 01:34:28,712
Actually, I don't think so.

1218
01:34:34,177 --> 01:34:37,679
Well...

1219
01:34:37,764 --> 01:34:42,309
you just, wait here.

1220
01:34:42,393 --> 01:34:45,145
Excuse me. Thank you.
Excuse me.

1221
01:34:45,229 --> 01:34:48,732
Excuse me.
Sorry.

1222
01:34:55,406 --> 01:34:57,324
Good evening.

1223
01:34:58,743 --> 01:35:02,496
I need a coat and tie.
Well, come on in.

1224
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,456
No.

1225
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:06,500
No?

1226
01:35:06,584 --> 01:35:09,753
- That one.
- This one?

1227
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:12,547
That one, yeah, and this tie.

1228
01:35:21,557 --> 01:35:23,558
Excuse me.

1229
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:29,773
She's here.

1230
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:32,859
We saved a table for you.
Thanks.

1231
01:35:32,944 --> 01:35:35,028
Should I get her for you?

1232
01:35:35,113 --> 01:35:39,032
No, it's all right.
I'll just watch.

1233
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:41,076
Hi!

1234
01:35:42,704 --> 01:35:44,871
Can I buy you a drink?

1235
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:48,041
This is plenty.
No, thank you.

1236
01:36:20,491 --> 01:36:23,452
Ma'am?

1237
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:33,503
Wait.

1238
01:37:03,618 --> 01:37:07,037
You look so se...

1239
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,541
You look, great.

1240
01:37:13,044 --> 01:37:15,337
You look great.

1241
01:37:24,847 --> 01:37:27,307
You wanna dance?

1242
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,229
Well, I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1243
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:34,397
- And?
- No.

1244
01:37:36,734 --> 01:37:42,322
I don't get this place.
They make me buy a new outfit,

1245
01:37:42,406 --> 01:37:45,075
and they let you in in a housedress.

1246
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:47,828
I don't get it.

1247
01:37:47,912 --> 01:37:50,413
What? Wait, wait.
No, wait. What?

1248
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:53,542
Where you going?
No, why? I mean, I...

1249
01:37:55,670 --> 01:38:00,257
I didn't mean it that way.
I mean, you gotta sit down.

1250
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:03,552
You can still give me the dirty look,
just sit down and give it to me.

1251
01:38:03,636 --> 01:38:09,015
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.
I need one. Quick.

1252
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,519
You have no idea how much what
you just said hurt my feelings.

1253
01:38:12,603 --> 01:38:18,191
The mono-minute someone gets that they
need you, they threaten to walk out.

1254
01:38:18,276 --> 01:38:21,361
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1255
01:38:21,445 --> 01:38:24,197
- This is a request from June...
- Now or never.

1256
01:38:24,282 --> 01:38:26,700
Okay.
Happy Anniversary.

1257
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:37,377
I mean it.

1258
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:50,640
Can we order first?

1259
01:38:54,145 --> 01:38:56,897
Okay.

1260
01:38:56,981 --> 01:39:02,903
Two hard-shell crab dinners!
Pitcher ice-cold beer!

1261
01:39:02,987 --> 01:39:06,907
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

1262
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:09,284
Fries.

1263
01:39:09,368 --> 01:39:12,954
Fries.
One baked, one fried.

1264
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:15,749
I'll tell your waiter!

1265
01:39:15,833 --> 01:39:20,670
My waiter.
Okay, now.

1266
01:39:20,755 --> 01:39:24,883
I got a real great compliment
for you, and it's true.

1267
01:39:24,967 --> 01:39:27,677
I'm so afraid you're about
to say something awful.

1268
01:39:27,762 --> 01:39:31,306
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1269
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:35,101
Okay, here I go.

1270
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,730
Clearly a mistake.

1271
01:39:40,316 --> 01:39:44,819
I've got this, what, ailment.

1272
01:39:48,824 --> 01:39:52,035
My doctor, a shrink
that I used to go to all the time,

1273
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:55,288
he says that in 50 or
60 percent of the cases,

1274
01:39:55,373 --> 01:39:58,124
a pill really helps.

1275
01:39:58,209 --> 01:40:00,210
I hate pills.

1276
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:02,545
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1277
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:07,467
Hate. I'm using the word
"hate" here about pills. Hate.

1278
01:40:07,551 --> 01:40:12,847
My compliment is, that night when you came
over and told me that you would never...

1279
01:40:12,932 --> 01:40:15,809
All right.

1280
01:40:15,893 --> 01:40:19,646
Well, you were there.
You... You know what you said.

1281
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:22,482
Well, my compliment to you is,

1282
01:40:23,526 --> 01:40:28,363
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1283
01:40:31,909 --> 01:40:34,703
I don't quite get how
that's a compliment for me.

1284
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:42,919
You make me want to be a better man.

1285
01:40:55,266 --> 01:40:58,893
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.

1286
01:41:04,108 --> 01:41:06,484
Well, maybe I overshot a little,
because I was aiming...

1287
01:41:06,569 --> 01:41:10,196
at just enough to keep you
from walking out.

1288
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:23,543
How's it goin' with those pills?

1289
01:41:24,712 --> 01:41:29,549
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

1290
01:41:29,633 --> 01:41:32,260
Well, it's...

1291
01:41:32,344 --> 01:41:34,804
it's little by little.

1292
01:41:36,849 --> 01:41:41,144
It's... It's exhausting talking like this.

1293
01:41:41,228 --> 01:41:43,146
Exhausting.

1294
01:42:01,499 --> 01:42:06,086
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1295
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:08,588
Never.

1296
01:42:08,672 --> 01:42:11,758
Here's the trouble with never.

1297
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:34,948
You don't owe me that.

1298
01:42:35,032 --> 01:42:37,867
That wasn't a payment.

1299
01:42:39,036 --> 01:42:40,954
When you first came into breakfast,

1300
01:42:41,038 --> 01:42:44,207
when I first saw you,
I thought you were handsome.

1301
01:42:45,918 --> 01:42:48,211
Then, of course, you spoke.

1302
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:57,137
So, now that your soft, little
underbelly's all exposed,

1303
01:42:57,221 --> 01:43:00,306
tell me, why did you bring me here?

1304
01:43:03,686 --> 01:43:05,728
Why,

1305
01:43:06,897 --> 01:43:10,066
it's a...

1306
01:43:11,527 --> 01:43:14,028
a personal question.

1307
01:43:14,155 --> 01:43:17,532
Tell me, even if you're scared.
Scared?

1308
01:43:17,616 --> 01:43:21,244
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1309
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:23,413
It's okay.

1310
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:27,667
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1311
01:43:27,751 --> 01:43:30,044
Well, I...

1312
01:43:30,129 --> 01:43:34,048
I know, I...

1313
01:43:34,133 --> 01:43:36,676
There's a lot of reasons.

1314
01:43:36,802 --> 01:43:42,056
I thought, maybe if you had sex
with Simon, maybe it would... What?

1315
01:43:44,059 --> 01:43:48,771
Well, it's... just one... It's one idea.
That's why you brought me?

1316
01:43:48,856 --> 01:43:54,444
Like I'm a... what, and I owe you what?

1317
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:56,905
I don't know why I brought you.
I...

1318
01:43:56,989 --> 01:43:59,334
It was just one thought that I had.
It came out first.

1319
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:00,859
That was all there was to it.

1320
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:06,956
I thought you kiss him... me...
when you two seemed to hit it off.

1321
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:10,168
Wait, no! Wait, wait.
That's... I didn't mean...

1322
01:44:10,294 --> 01:44:13,546
Forget what I said about Simon.
I'll never forget you said it.

1323
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:15,965
It's a mistake.

1324
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:18,968
It was a mistake.

1325
01:44:23,349 --> 01:44:26,601
Hello, this is Fred Bishop... And Betty.

1326
01:44:26,685 --> 01:44:28,556
Sorry to be unable to take your call.

1327
01:44:28,581 --> 01:44:30,981
Please leave a message
with all pertinent information.

1328
01:44:31,482 --> 01:44:33,233
Say "good-bye."
Good-bye.

1329
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:35,068
And thank you.

1330
01:44:35,152 --> 01:44:38,571
It's Simon.

1331
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,907
I'm in town.

1332
01:44:41,992 --> 01:44:44,077
Hello?

1333
01:44:45,829 --> 01:44:48,831
Folks, you haven't been out later
than 10:00 in your entire lives.

1334
01:44:48,916 --> 01:44:51,459
Please pick up the phone.

1335
01:44:53,837 --> 01:44:55,797
Really!

1336
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:04,472
Okay, well, I'm gonna try you in the morning.
I need to, see you,

1337
01:45:04,556 --> 01:45:07,016
or at least get you to answer the phone.

1338
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:19,320
How are ya?

1339
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:21,864
Is this gonna be your room?
Our room.

1340
01:45:21,949 --> 01:45:25,118
I don't wanna see him, and he's not
gonna come knockin' on your door.

1341
01:45:25,202 --> 01:45:27,287
What happened?

1342
01:45:27,413 --> 01:45:29,664
Don't ask.

1343
01:45:32,001 --> 01:45:34,961
Can you not be so violent?
I don't think so.

1344
01:45:35,045 --> 01:45:37,338
Do you need help...
No!

1345
01:45:39,425 --> 01:45:42,635
I'm taking a big bath and
ordering a big meal.

1346
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,138
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1347
01:45:45,222 --> 01:45:47,642
Don't ask.
I'm tired of my own complaints.

1348
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:49,267
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1349
01:45:49,727 --> 01:45:54,230
- Why? What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

1350
01:45:55,774 --> 01:45:59,569
Can you believe in our little
mix you're the "good" roommate?

1351
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:15,543
Good night.
Good night.

1352
01:46:57,628 --> 01:47:00,046
Hold it.

1353
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:23,403
I have to draw you.

1354
01:47:25,322 --> 01:47:28,116
I have to draw you.

1355
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,869
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
I'm a lot more shy than people think.

1356
01:47:31,995 --> 01:47:33,996
I give off the wrong
impression... I have to.

1357
01:47:34,081 --> 01:47:38,751
- I haven't sketched anything in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

1358
01:47:38,836 --> 01:47:41,170
But you're beautiful, Carol.

1359
01:47:41,255 --> 01:47:45,425
Your skin, your long neck,

1360
01:47:45,509 --> 01:47:48,094
the back, the line of you...

1361
01:47:49,388 --> 01:47:53,266
You're why cavemen chiseled on walls.

1362
01:47:56,186 --> 01:47:58,312
All right, cut me a break.

1363
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:27,175
The next thing I know, she's
sittin' right there next to me, you know.

1364
01:48:27,259 --> 01:48:31,387
Well, it's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

1365
01:48:31,472 --> 01:48:35,308
I... screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1366
01:48:39,146 --> 01:48:42,607
Where if I hadn't, I...

1367
01:48:42,691 --> 01:48:46,319
I could be in bed right now
with a woman who if...

1368
01:48:46,403 --> 01:48:49,655
you make her laugh you got a life.

1369
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:54,660
Instead, I'm here with you.

1370
01:48:54,745 --> 01:48:58,414
No offense, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1371
01:49:03,378 --> 01:49:05,379
Jameson, soda back.

1372
01:49:07,966 --> 01:49:10,009
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1373
01:49:10,093 --> 01:49:12,386
We're bein' naughty here, pal.

1374
01:49:12,471 --> 01:49:15,389
No, no, this is... this is great.

1375
01:49:15,474 --> 01:49:17,517
This is so great.

1376
01:49:17,601 --> 01:49:20,811
I swear to God, my hand
won't even keep up.

1377
01:49:20,938 --> 01:49:22,980
Hold it. Hold it.
I'm just turning.

1378
01:49:23,106 --> 01:49:25,942
But then hold that. Hold any of them.
Okay, this?

1379
01:49:26,026 --> 01:49:29,695
It doesn't matter. I can't get over
my hand's not even bothering me.

1380
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:32,740
I can't... I just... I...

1381
01:49:32,824 --> 01:49:36,953
I can't get the angle
with this... this cast.

1382
01:49:40,249 --> 01:49:43,876
Careful!

1383
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,556
I'm comin' in.
It's late.

1384
01:50:01,562 --> 01:50:04,438
Did you have sex with her?

1385
01:50:04,523 --> 01:50:08,651
Okay, so are you sure you don't
want your shampoos or anything?

1386
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:13,114
Sorry.

1387
01:50:14,992 --> 01:50:18,202
I didn't know she was still here.

1388
01:50:18,328 --> 01:50:21,247
Did you have sex with her?
To hell with sex!

1389
01:50:21,331 --> 01:50:23,833
It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1390
01:50:25,335 --> 01:50:28,754
What I need he gave me, great.

1391
01:50:28,839 --> 01:50:30,840
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1392
01:50:36,847 --> 01:50:39,265
I just love her.

1393
01:50:43,687 --> 01:50:45,646
How you doin'?

1394
01:51:00,954 --> 01:51:03,122
Hello?

1395
01:51:03,206 --> 01:51:06,292
Mom? Hi.
Hello, Simon.

1396
01:51:06,376 --> 01:51:08,919
You were right.
We were home last night.

1397
01:51:09,046 --> 01:51:10,865
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1398
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:12,490
I'm not a screamer.
Look...

1399
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:16,594
No, no, no, no. It was the luckiest
thing for all of us you didn't answer.

1400
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:20,014
Your father has not been feeling well.
I can't hear you!

1401
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:23,684
Hold on. Hold for what?
What do you gotta do?

1402
01:51:23,769 --> 01:51:26,937
I get why you're angry
with me, but it's no...

1403
01:51:27,064 --> 01:51:30,149
He's talking to his parents.
Then you listen to me.

1404
01:51:30,233 --> 01:51:33,486
Truly, no grudges.
Okay? Truly.

1405
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:37,615
I mean, it was a little odd that you didn't
come and see me when you heard I was hurt...

1406
01:51:37,741 --> 01:51:41,035
We almost did.
I don't even wanna talk about it. I...

1407
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:45,623
The important thing is that your son is happy.
You do sound different.

1408
01:51:45,749 --> 01:51:48,668
Yes, I'm working again...
Good. About money...

1409
01:51:48,752 --> 01:51:50,961
No, I don't need anything.

1410
01:51:51,046 --> 01:51:53,714
I'll drop you a line
from wherever I land,

1411
01:51:53,799 --> 01:51:56,425
and then it's up to you to make
the next move, and I hope you do.

1412
01:51:56,510 --> 01:52:02,181
Then he's gonna wanna stay. And they'll
wanna take a ride to the lake or whatever...

1413
01:52:02,307 --> 01:52:05,351
Okay. Bye-bye.
He's gonna feel stirred up.

1414
01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:08,437
Bye, dear.
Bye, Mom.

1415
01:52:08,522 --> 01:52:10,981
So, we'll probably have
a good five-hour drive.

1416
01:52:11,108 --> 01:52:13,567
It'll give us a chance to relax... So?

1417
01:52:13,694 --> 01:52:16,195
Be together alone... I'm coming with you.

1418
01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:20,700
- What about your parents?
- No, no, no. I'll take care of myself.

1419
01:52:20,784 --> 01:52:23,911
What are you talkin' about?
You got real problems.

1420
01:52:23,995 --> 01:52:28,207
I know.
I'm a little bit nervous.

1421
01:52:28,291 --> 01:52:32,044
Suddenly, everything seems so easy.

1422
01:52:32,129 --> 01:52:35,673
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1423
01:52:35,799 --> 01:52:40,052
One night with me.
You think you're kidding.

1424
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:47,059
Geez.
No choice.

1425
01:52:47,185 --> 01:52:51,147
I got a gift for you. Nothing like
no choice to make you feel at home.

1426
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:53,232
Let me see.

1427
01:52:53,316 --> 01:52:55,651
Gorgeous.

1428
01:52:55,736 --> 01:53:00,614
Do it then. And get the dog picked up.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1429
01:53:00,699 --> 01:53:04,660
Good-bye.
Your luck's runnin'.

1430
01:53:06,037 --> 01:53:09,665
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1431
01:53:11,668 --> 01:53:14,879
Frank's got a line on another
place you can use for now.

1432
01:53:15,005 --> 01:53:18,632
Another place where?
Does it matter?

1433
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:23,179
No.

1434
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:25,431
It doesn't.

1435
01:53:25,515 --> 01:53:28,684
I'm fine.
Like the hat?

1436
01:53:28,769 --> 01:53:32,313
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1437
01:54:04,721 --> 01:54:07,389
I don't wanna hear that music right now.

1438
01:54:07,516 --> 01:54:10,351
What do you mean?
You said you liked it. I don't.

1439
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:19,026
Well, it's your car, but I don't wanna
hear it, if that means anything!

1440
01:54:39,130 --> 01:54:41,298
Yes, sir.
All right.

1441
01:54:41,383 --> 01:54:45,553
Here's the keys to my apartment.

1442
01:54:45,637 --> 01:54:50,015
You go up there and wait, and
I'm gonna take Carol home. Wait...

1443
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:52,184
I'll take a bus.

1444
01:54:52,269 --> 01:54:53,435
No, no, I'll take ya.

1445
01:55:00,193 --> 01:55:02,570
Can you...
Can you come here?

1446
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:05,739
Look, I don't care what you did for me.
I... What's wrong?

1447
01:55:07,117 --> 01:55:09,577
I don't think I wanna know you anymore.

1448
01:55:09,661 --> 01:55:13,038
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1449
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:17,710
You have my number.

1450
01:55:20,463 --> 01:55:22,548
Let him take you home.

1451
01:55:22,632 --> 01:55:25,009
Don't want to.

1452
01:55:25,093 --> 01:55:28,721
I love you.
Love you too.

1453
01:55:37,147 --> 01:55:40,482
Don't say anything.

1454
01:55:43,486 --> 01:55:47,406
Yeah, look, I gotta get a hold of Frank
and see where I'm hangin' my hat.

1455
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:52,494
Well, I think you're gonna
have to camp it here.

1456
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:55,039
What are you talking about?
Look.

1457
01:55:55,165 --> 01:55:59,084
Look at you, sweetheart.
Look at you. Come here.

1458
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:01,420
Look at you, sweetheart.
Look at Verdell!

1459
01:56:01,504 --> 01:56:05,090
You feel like your old self again.
I know the feeling.

1460
01:56:05,175 --> 01:56:07,927
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1461
01:56:10,472 --> 01:56:13,265
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1462
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:15,601
Okay.

1463
01:56:15,685 --> 01:56:17,645
They rented your place furnished.

1464
01:56:17,729 --> 01:56:20,940
Jackie said she was gonna
bring your personal things.

1465
01:56:21,024 --> 01:56:26,070
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room. I never use it.

1466
01:56:26,196 --> 01:56:29,448
It's got good light.
No other choice really.

1467
01:56:29,532 --> 01:56:31,951
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.

1468
01:56:33,703 --> 01:56:38,165
Well, this is, nice.

1469
01:56:38,249 --> 01:56:40,334
It's...
Looks good. They...

1470
01:56:40,418 --> 01:56:44,630
They got your music,

1471
01:56:44,714 --> 01:56:47,132
paintings, paints.

1472
01:56:47,217 --> 01:56:49,843
I'd have to say they did a good job.

1473
01:56:49,928 --> 01:56:51,971
It's...

1474
01:56:53,139 --> 01:56:55,432
You know, it's gonna be okay?

1475
01:56:55,558 --> 01:56:58,560
Cozy?
Yeah.

1476
01:57:01,898 --> 01:57:05,359
Thank you, Melvin.

1477
01:57:06,569 --> 01:57:09,071
You overwhelm me.

1478
01:57:15,537 --> 01:57:17,579
I love you.

1479
01:57:24,337 --> 01:57:26,588
I tell ya, buddy,

1480
01:57:26,673 --> 01:57:30,092
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1481
01:57:37,684 --> 01:57:40,686
Well, let's...

1482
01:57:43,231 --> 01:57:45,357
Make yourself at home.

1483
01:57:47,944 --> 01:57:50,654
Anything else in the bag?

1484
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:54,742
But I was playing soccer
while you were away! I know.

1485
01:57:54,826 --> 01:57:57,828
I love my cookbook!

1486
01:57:57,912 --> 01:58:01,582
It's great. It's got all these
wonderful recipes in here.

1487
01:58:01,666 --> 01:58:05,335
It says something with a shark.
I never even fixed shark before.

1488
01:58:05,462 --> 01:58:08,881
Shark with a bite, would you
like that, Spencer? No.

1489
01:58:08,965 --> 01:58:11,717
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' Nests."

1490
01:58:15,055 --> 01:58:19,933
Where is my big, hairy boy?
Where is he?

1491
01:58:21,144 --> 01:58:24,605
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart?

1492
01:58:25,899 --> 01:58:28,233
You're in bed.

1493
01:58:28,318 --> 01:58:30,069
No.
No.

1494
01:58:31,237 --> 01:58:34,615
Yeah... Melvin.

1495
01:58:34,699 --> 01:58:38,952
I just didn't think Verdell
should get too comfortable...

1496
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:41,997
sleeping in here 'cause it's
really not gonna... Well, look.

1497
01:58:42,082 --> 01:58:45,000
The dog's already comfortable.

1498
01:58:46,086 --> 01:58:48,921
Is this okay?

1499
01:58:51,841 --> 01:58:55,511
Hello?
Hi, it's me. Hi!

1500
01:58:55,595 --> 01:58:59,014
Yes!
He took me in.

1501
01:58:59,099 --> 01:59:01,141
Yes.
It's Carol for you.

1502
01:59:01,226 --> 01:59:05,270
I basically fainted when I walked
in and Jackie had... Just take the dog.

1503
01:59:05,396 --> 01:59:07,564
Take the dog!
I gotta go.

1504
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:10,109
Just take the dog.
Come here.

1505
01:59:10,193 --> 01:59:12,069
That's right.
Take him.

1506
01:59:12,195 --> 01:59:14,530
Come on. Move fast.

1507
01:59:14,656 --> 01:59:17,658
Don't limp. Move fast.
Come on. Good luck.

1508
01:59:28,545 --> 01:59:31,046
Hello?

1509
01:59:32,799 --> 01:59:35,926
Yeah.
How you doin'?

1510
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:39,138
Not so hot.
Why? What's wrong?

1511
01:59:40,557 --> 01:59:43,809
I don't know whether I'm being
sensible or hard on you.

1512
01:59:43,893 --> 01:59:45,894
Maybe both.
Maybe.

1513
01:59:45,979 --> 01:59:49,982
See? Right there I don't know whether
you're being cute or crazy now.

1514
01:59:50,066 --> 01:59:53,485
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer everything I say!

1515
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:58,073
Just listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

1516
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:02,578
It's really something that
you're looking after Simon.

1517
02:00:02,662 --> 02:00:08,083
And what I said on the street,
that was a bad thing to say.

1518
02:00:08,168 --> 02:00:12,504
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1519
02:00:15,175 --> 02:00:19,761
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I... enjoy your company.

1520
02:00:21,347 --> 02:00:24,558
But the truth is
you do bother me enormously.

1521
02:00:24,642 --> 02:00:27,269
And I know that... think that it's...

1522
02:00:27,353 --> 02:00:31,857
I think that it's better for me to not have
contact with you because you're not ready.

1523
02:00:31,941 --> 02:00:36,904
And you're a pretty old guy to not be
ready, and I'm too old to ignore that!

1524
02:00:36,988 --> 02:00:42,367
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

1525
02:00:49,292 --> 02:00:51,752
So, anyway, thanks for the trip.

1526
02:00:53,463 --> 02:00:56,715
Good night.
Good night.

1527
02:00:56,799 --> 02:00:59,885
Okay if I say somethin' now?

1528
02:01:02,889 --> 02:01:04,806
Go ahead.

1529
02:01:07,143 --> 02:01:09,561
I should've danced with you.

1530
02:01:14,776 --> 02:01:20,405
Good night.

1531
02:01:37,257 --> 02:01:39,591
Are you gonna talk to me or not?

1532
02:01:39,676 --> 02:01:42,928
I'm coming.

1533
02:01:51,062 --> 02:01:53,605
What'd she say?

1534
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:57,859
That I'm a great guy, extraordinary,

1535
02:01:57,944 --> 02:02:01,321
and she doesn't want contact with me!

1536
02:02:03,533 --> 02:02:06,285
I'm dyin' here.

1537
02:02:07,537 --> 02:02:11,456
Because... you love her.

1538
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:13,500
No.

1539
02:02:13,584 --> 02:02:16,962
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1540
02:02:17,046 --> 02:02:21,258
Then you tell me why!
You're the one who's "dying here".

1541
02:02:21,342 --> 02:02:25,345
- I don't know. Let me sleep on it.
- Come on!

1542
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:28,807
- I'll figure it out.
- Please.

1543
02:02:28,891 --> 02:02:32,102
It's...

1544
02:02:32,186 --> 02:02:36,648
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my own life.

1545
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:41,403
She's evicted me from my life.

1546
02:02:41,487 --> 02:02:43,405
Did you really like it that much?

1547
02:02:44,532 --> 02:02:47,701
Well, it's better than this.
Look, you.

1548
02:02:47,785 --> 02:02:49,164
I'm very intelligent.

1549
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:52,189
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1550
02:02:52,248 --> 02:02:56,293
If you can't be at least mildly
interesting, then shut the hell up!

1551
02:02:56,377 --> 02:03:00,380
I mean, I'm drowning here,
and you're describing the water!

1552
02:03:00,465 --> 02:03:02,007
Well, picking on me won't help!

1553
02:03:04,677 --> 02:03:06,928
Well, if that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1554
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:12,893
But... Melvin, do, do you know
where you're lucky?

1555
02:03:16,606 --> 02:03:19,066
You know who you want.

1556
02:03:21,361 --> 02:03:24,279
I would take your seat any day.

1557
02:03:24,405 --> 02:03:26,698
So, so, do something about it!

1558
02:03:26,783 --> 02:03:29,409
Go over there, now, tonight!
Don't sleep on it.

1559
02:03:29,494 --> 02:03:33,121
I mean, it's not always good
to let things calm down.

1560
02:03:33,206 --> 02:03:35,957
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this.

1561
02:03:36,042 --> 02:03:40,712
You can. Pull the stops.
Tell her how you feel. You can do this.

1562
02:03:40,797 --> 02:03:43,215
Hey, I'm charged here.

1563
02:03:43,341 --> 02:03:46,760
Yes, you are!
She might kill me if I go over there.

1564
02:03:46,844 --> 02:03:49,888
Well, then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story!

1565
02:03:49,972 --> 02:03:52,391
I really think you have a chance here.

1566
02:03:52,475 --> 02:03:56,395
The best thing you have going for you is
your willingness to humiliate yourself.

1567
02:03:56,479 --> 02:03:59,731
So, go over there. Do this.
Catch her off guard.

1568
02:04:05,113 --> 02:04:07,239
Okay.
Okay.

1569
02:04:09,492 --> 02:04:12,077
Thanks a lot.
Okay.

1570
02:04:13,913 --> 02:04:16,665
Here I go.

1571
02:04:24,507 --> 02:04:26,258
What's wrong?

1572
02:04:29,929 --> 02:04:33,181
I forgot to lock the door.

1573
02:05:50,676 --> 02:05:55,055
- What do you want, Melvin?
- I'm sorry I woke you. Some other time...

1574
02:05:55,139 --> 02:05:56,765
I wasn't asleep.

1575
02:06:01,479 --> 02:06:03,522
What a break.

1576
02:06:05,858 --> 02:06:08,568
Is it a secret what you're doing here?

1577
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,448
I had to see you.

1578
02:06:16,827 --> 02:06:18,787
Because?

1579
02:06:22,124 --> 02:06:25,126
It relaxes me.

1580
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:31,091
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb...

1581
02:06:31,175 --> 02:06:35,804
than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1582
02:06:35,888 --> 02:06:38,598
No, no, wait.
That's... That's overstating.

1583
02:06:38,683 --> 02:06:42,394
I'd rather be sitting
inside on the steps,

1584
02:06:42,478 --> 02:06:44,604
'cause I don't wanna get
my feet in the gutter.

1585
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:46,273
What would that serve?
Stop it!

1586
02:06:46,357 --> 02:06:50,068
Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend?
Why?

1587
02:06:50,152 --> 02:06:54,281
Just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me?

1588
02:06:54,365 --> 02:06:57,826
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1589
02:06:59,662 --> 02:07:02,581
I'm sorry.

1590
02:07:02,665 --> 02:07:05,917
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1591
02:07:12,258 --> 02:07:14,175
Boyfriend.

1592
02:07:18,514 --> 02:07:22,851
Come on in, and try not to
ruin everything by being you.

1593
02:07:24,312 --> 02:07:27,022
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks.

1594
02:07:31,902 --> 02:07:34,279
Maybe we could.

1595
02:08:00,514 --> 02:08:05,518
It feels a little confined in here.
Let's take a walk.

1596
02:08:08,522 --> 02:08:13,818
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me,

1597
02:08:13,903 --> 02:08:16,029
if you don't mind.

1598
02:08:16,113 --> 02:08:20,200
Well, if you need an excuse,

1599
02:08:20,284 --> 02:08:22,202
there's a bakery on the corner.

1600
02:08:22,286 --> 02:08:26,915
We got a good shot it'll be open soon.
That way we're not screwy.

1601
02:08:26,999 --> 02:08:31,002
Just... two people that like warm rolls.

1602
02:08:35,466 --> 02:08:37,759
Okay.

1603
02:08:54,985 --> 02:08:57,529
What are you doing?

1604
02:08:57,613 --> 02:09:00,532
I still want you to hear
part of that car song.

1605
02:09:00,658 --> 02:09:03,535
You don't have to.

1606
02:09:09,125 --> 02:09:14,212
<i>And darling I'm never lonely</i>

1607
02:09:14,296 --> 02:09:17,549
<i>Whenever you're in sight</i>

1608
02:09:18,634 --> 02:09:21,886
Thank you.

1609
02:09:21,971 --> 02:09:24,222
You know, I was hop...

1610
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:43,158
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is is not gonna work.

1611
02:09:52,668 --> 02:09:55,253
I'm feeling...
What?

1612
02:09:55,337 --> 02:09:57,464
I've been feel...

1613
02:09:57,590 --> 02:10:00,967
I'm feeling better, Carol.
Melvin.

1614
02:10:01,051 --> 02:10:04,763
Even though it may seem that way now,

1615
02:10:04,847 --> 02:10:07,307
you don't know me all that well.

1616
02:10:07,391 --> 02:10:09,309
I'm not the answer for you.

1617
02:10:09,393 --> 02:10:13,104
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.

1618
02:10:13,189 --> 02:10:15,440
You know what.
I...

1619
02:10:15,524 --> 02:10:20,361
Just let me... let me talk.

1620
02:10:20,446 --> 02:10:22,614
Just...

1621
02:10:26,202 --> 02:10:29,829
I might be the only person
on the face of the Earth...

1622
02:10:29,914 --> 02:10:32,248
that knows you're
the greatest woman on Earth.

1623
02:10:32,374 --> 02:10:35,210
I might be the only one...

1624
02:10:35,294 --> 02:10:41,049
Who appreciates how amazing you are
in every single thing that you do.

1625
02:10:41,133 --> 02:10:45,303
And how you are with Spencer, Spence.

1626
02:10:45,387 --> 02:10:49,015
And in every single thought
that you have...

1627
02:10:49,099 --> 02:10:53,019
and how you say what you mean and how
you almost always mean something...

1628
02:10:53,103 --> 02:10:57,649
that's all about being straight and good.

1629
02:10:57,733 --> 02:11:02,654
And I think most people
miss that about you.

1630
02:11:02,738 --> 02:11:06,741
And I watch them, wondering how they
can watch you bring their food...

1631
02:11:06,826 --> 02:11:11,663
and clear their tables and never get that
they just met the greatest woman alive.

1632
02:11:11,747 --> 02:11:14,165
And the fact that I get it...

1633
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:16,918
makes me feel good...

1634
02:11:18,254 --> 02:11:20,421
about me.

1635
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:34,727
Is that something that's bad
for you to be around... for you?

1636
02:11:44,446 --> 02:11:46,364
No.

1637
02:11:49,451 --> 02:11:51,369
I'm gonna grab you.

1638
02:11:53,455 --> 02:11:57,458
I didn't mean for that to be a question.
I'm gonna grab you.

1639
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:23,568
I know I can do better than that.

1640
02:12:23,652 --> 02:12:25,945
Oh, Mel...

1641
02:12:48,177 --> 02:12:50,136
Better.
Definitely better.

1642
02:12:57,186 --> 02:12:58,853
See?

1643
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:15,745
What's this?

1644
02:13:15,829 --> 02:13:18,957
Warm rolls.

1645
02:13:26,423 --> 02:13:29,133
- Scusate mi.
- Excuse us.
