1
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:14,656
Our man's in position
on the center camera.

2
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:16,831
It's like a terrorist supermarket.

3
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:21,264
Chinese Long March Scud,
Panther AS-565 attack helicopter...

4
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:24,461
...a pair of Russian mortars, and
the crates look like American rifles.

5
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:29,298
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.

6
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:31,610
IDs.

7
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:34,246
White Rook to White Knight.
Show us the pawns.

8
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:38,042
You see, he did get through, admiral.
Start with that chap in the middle.

9
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,310
Load the ID program, please.

10
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,317
Database ID search.

11
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:44,319
Checking the databases.

12
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:47,357
We've got our first match.
Satoshi Isagura.

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,050
Chemical expert.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.

14
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:53,628
Currently working for
the insurgent force in Zaire.

15
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,324
Henry Gupta. American.

16
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,164
Practically invented
techno-terrorism.

17
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,068
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.

18
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,071
Now he sells his politics for cash.

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,541
- Zoom in on that, can you?
- That looks like an American encoder.

20
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:11,874
They use it to control navigation
satellites: The GPS system.

21
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:15,719
Will the CIA be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it?

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,683
Excuse me. Admiral?

23
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:23,520
Thank you, M, we've seen enough.
This is now a military operation.

24
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,422
You saw the Gatling gun?

25
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:27,926
Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?

26
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:31,261
We have election
in Moscow next week.

27
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:35,371
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

28
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,870
We'll take the naval option.

29
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,099
In one strike, we take out
half the world's terrorists.

30
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:43,708
<i>- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
- Get me the Chester,</i>

31
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,313
- Let's not waste time.
- My man isn't finished.

32
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49,814
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.

33
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:53,450
Get your man out of there.
His job is over.

34
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:56,854
<i>Weapons authorized,
Prepare to fire,</i>

35
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:03,687
On my count.
Five, four, three, two, one.

36
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,127
Missile away.

37
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,863
Time to target:
Four minutes, eight seconds.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,704
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.

39
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,473
Yes, damn it, I know what it is.
It's on the screen in front of me.

40
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,273
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

41
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,383
Now, get the hell out of there!

42
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:27,076
- What the hell's going on?
- You will not wait!

43
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,847
- That's an order!
- What is your man waiting for?

44
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:32,888
White Knight? Oh, my God!

45
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,357
Those are Soviet SB-5
nuclear torpedoes.

46
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:40,495
- lf the cruise hits them...
- Order them to abort the missile.

47
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>- H, M, S, Chester, urgent.
- White Knight, come in.</i>

48
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:47,863
Abort missile. Abort missile.

49
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:50,008
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.

50
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,878
Captain, sir, missile out of range.

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,671
<i>Unable to destroy,</i>

52
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,681
- White Knight...
- Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

53
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:07,390
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.

54
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:10,583
But even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium...

55
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:13,194
...to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.

56
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:16,491
Bloody hell. Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

57
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,259
Evacuate your troops,
and get him out of there, now.

58
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,529
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in.

59
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,141
- Keep trying, damn it.
- White Knight, come in.

60
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:31,442
Repeat, White Knight, come in.

61
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:43,923
Filthy habit.

62
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,936
I've got the encoder.

63
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:10,546
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.

64
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,084
He's going for the bombs.

65
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,902
Get that jeep!

66
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,546
Get out of it, James.

67
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,645
One minute to impact.

68
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,431
Thirty seconds to impact.

69
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:08,937
Back-seat driver.

70
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:13,775
White Knight to White Rook.

71
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:16,105
<i>I've evacuated the area,</i>

72
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,977
<i>Ask the admiral where
he'd like his bombs delivered,</i>

73
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,729
Sound the general alarm.

74
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:46,673
<i>The ship has been overflown
by two Chinese MiGs,</i>

75
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,674
We believe they have hostile intent.

76
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:52,472
<i>Hands to action stations,</i>

77
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,824
Officer of the watch, maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.

78
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:13,798
Aye, aye, sir.
Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.

79
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,492
Are they insane?

80
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,670
The Chinese pilot insists that
we are only 11 miles off their coast...

81
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:26,209
...and he will fire if we don't
turn around and go to a Chinese port.

82
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,009
Send this:
"We are in international waters...

83
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,014
...and will defend ourselves
if attacked.

84
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,913
Copy all this
to the Admiralty, urgent.

85
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,657
Are we absolutely sure
of our position?

86
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:41,827
Yes, sir. An exact satellite fix.

87
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:17,192
Captain, we are ready to launch.

88
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,330
Shut down the engines.

89
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,157
Maintain full silence.

90
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:25,064
A stealth ship may be invisible
to radar but the sea drill isn't.

91
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:32,502
We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by...

92
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,701
...and the British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.

93
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:37,903
I should report in.

94
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,250
<i>Stamper to Hamburg,
Phase one is in progress,</i>

95
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:49,085
<i>I'll report back to you
with an update,</i>

96
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:59,132
- The MiGs are making another pass.
- Let's start the show.

97
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,130
Sea drill in position.

98
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:14,745
Start the drill.

99
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,453
- Release it.
- Sea drill away.

100
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,994
Green 3-0,
torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.

101
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,067
Green 3-0, center bearing 1-1-4.

102
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,397
Officer of the Watch,
come hard right, 1-4-1.

103
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,096
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

104
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,271
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.

105
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,310
Brace, brace, brace.

106
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:59,780
- Target: 1200.
- Knock, knock.

107
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,474
Let's go upstairs.

108
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,211
- Turn left.
- Rotating 90 degrees.

109
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,828
Now they're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.

110
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:50,197
PWO, captain.
Full damage report.

111
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:56,842
Backup power, immediately!

112
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,809
Switch to alternate supply.

113
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:04,415
Three generators are down, sir.
Flooding on four deck aft.

114
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:07,520
Sir, we're now down
14 degrees by the stern.

115
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,087
Yeoman, send to Admiralty:

116
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,986
"Have been torpedoed by
Chinese MiGs. Sinking."

117
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:16,328
Give them our position.
Right. Abandon ship.

118
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,921
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

119
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,665
Everyone on deck! Come on!

120
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,546
One missile at the MiGs.

121
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,262
Maintaining radio silence.

122
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,440
Their last broadcast, sir.

123
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,972
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.

124
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:11,271
They gave their final position
70 miles from here.

125
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,712
The British Navy
will never find them.

126
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:18,117
Survivors in the water.

127
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:37,603
Mr. Stamper,
I'm having fun with my headlines.

128
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:40,502
I need to know
the exact number of survivors.

129
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:44,405
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.

130
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:46,079
<i>Yes, sir,</i>

131
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:50,745
Delicious.

132
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,804
Start the recovery operation.

133
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:23,106
<i>Send our divers
down to the Devonshire,</i>

134
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,331
<i>Mr, Gupta? Phase one is complete,</i>

135
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,408
Good morning, my golden retrievers.

136
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:07,817
What kind of havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create in the world today?

137
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:11,049
<i>- News.
- Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris,</i>

138
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,388
<i>- And a plane crash in California,
- Excellent.</i>

139
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:18,496
Mr. Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?

140
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,926
<i>Yes, sir,
As requested, it's full of bugs,,,</i>

141
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,502
<i>,,, which means people will be
forced to upgrade for years,</i>

142
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:25,798
Outstanding.

143
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:29,040
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

144
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:32,440
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill
lowering the cable rates...

145
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,547
...we'll release a video of him
with the cheerleader...

146
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:37,546
<i>...in the Chicago motel room.
- Inspired, sir,</i>

147
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:40,084
After he signs the bill,
release the tape anyway.

148
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,744
<i>Consider him slimed,</i>

149
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,250
Excuse me.

150
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:47,683
- He's on transponder seven.
- Mr. Stamper?

151
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:53,028
<i>Phase two is underway,
I have the videotape,</i>

152
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:57,066
<i>I haven't seen it myself,
but I'm told the footage is excellent,</i>

153
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:01,205
<i>Plus, there were 17 survivors
for your headlines,</i>

154
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:02,772
Good work, Stamper.

155
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:06,942
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

156
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,906
Make sure you keep it
in a safe place.

157
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,107
Gentlemen and ladies...

158
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,709
...hold the presses.

159
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,750
This just in.

160
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:22,287
By a curious quirk of fate,
we have the perfect story...

161
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,986
...with which to launch our
Satellite News Network tonight.

162
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,497
It seems a small crisis is brewing
in the South China Seas.

163
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:35,230
I want full newspaper coverage.
I want magazine stories.

164
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:39,135
I want books. I want films.
I want TV. I want radio.

165
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,071
I want us on the air
24 hours a day.

166
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:44,110
This is our moment!

167
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:48,015
And a billion people
around this planet...

168
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:50,650
...will watch it, hear it...

169
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:55,290
...and read about it
from the Carver Media Group.

170
00:21:57,026 --> 00:22:00,985
There's no news like bad news.

171
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:42,827
How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?

172
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,503
Just ignore it.

173
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:48,731
Those are words they just
don't have in their vocabulary.

174
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:54,536
<i>- Bond here.
- Go to a secure line, 007,</i>

175
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:58,147
Going to scrambler, channel four.

176
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,584
That's ridiculous.
That ship was in international waters.

177
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:06,018
- We can't be certain.
- James? Where are you?

178
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:08,055
Oh, Moneypenny.

179
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:14,028
I'm just up here at Oxford
brushing up on a little Danish.

180
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:15,426
Little?

181
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,693
<i>I'm afraid you're gonna have to
kiss off your lesson,</i>

182
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:20,358
We've got a situation here
at the Ministry of Defense.

183
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:22,471
We're sending the fleet to China.

184
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:27,531
I'll be there in an hour.

185
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:29,234
Make that 30 minutes.

186
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:36,745
You always were
a cunning linguist, James.

187
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:41,985
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

188
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:57,927
That's preposterous. We know exactly
where that ship was positioned.

189
00:23:58,106 --> 00:24:01,371
The GPS system... Global
Positioning Satellites do not lie.

190
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:05,273
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal...

191
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:07,811
...on the GPS frequency
at the time of the attack.

192
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,573
It could've sent that ship
off course.

193
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,616
- I have a missing British frigate...
- I'm aware of that!

194
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,083
And instead of decisive action,
all you wanna do is investigate.

195
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,485
My goal is to prevent World War III,
admiral, and I don't think...

196
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:20,627
...sending an armada into the recovery
area is the best way to do it.

197
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,956
Where, exactly, did this mysterious
GPS signal come from?

198
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,962
- We're still investigating.
- "Investigating."

199
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:30,727
M, sometimes I don't think
you have the balls for this job.

200
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,128
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

201
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,398
...I don't have to think
with them all the time.

202
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,170
That's enough.
Now, where do we stand?

203
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:44,406
It was an unprovoked attack
on a ship in international waters.

204
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:48,073
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.

205
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:50,516
Moderation. We investigate...

206
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,816
...and stop short of sending
the entire British Navy...

207
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,117
...within 10 minutes
of the world's largest air force.

208
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:58,262
- When will our ships be in position?
- Forty-eight hours.

209
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,430
Christ!

210
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,461
The press are already
screaming for blood.

211
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:05,499
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.

212
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:08,694
I'm afraid it may be too late
to worry about that.

213
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:13,465
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

214
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,106
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies...

215
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,878
...the victims were riddled
with the same ammunition...

216
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,449
...used by the Chinese Air Force.
- Did you leak this?

217
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,881
No.

218
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:28,688
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.

219
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:32,126
We send in the fleet.

220
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,592
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

221
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:45,805
There is one strange thing.

222
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:48,475
When I called our contact
in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

223
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:50,632
...only found our sailors
three hours ago.

224
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,505
How'd they get the paper out
so fast?

225
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:56,211
<i>Somebody at Tomorrow knew before
the Vietnamese government did.</i>

226
00:25:56,883 --> 00:26:00,046
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?

227
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,551
Worldwide media baron.

228
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:04,349
Able to topple governments
with a single broadcast.

229
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:07,158
<i>Carver owns
that newspaper Tomorrow,</i>

230
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,423
I didn't want to discuss it
in front of the minister...

231
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:12,496
...but that mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

232
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,557
The PM would have my head
if he knew you were investigating him.

233
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:20,603
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007.
We've arranged for your invitation...

234
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:22,764
...to a party
at Carver's Media center.

235
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,334
They're celebrating the launch
of a new satellite...

236
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,003
...because now he has the ability
to reach every human on the Earth.

237
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,239
Except the Chinese,
who have refused broadcast rights.

238
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:38,282
James, your ticket, cover story
and rental car reservation.

239
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:40,048
Sign here, please.

240
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,890
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

241
00:26:44,861 --> 00:26:47,091
That was a long time ago, M...

242
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:49,197
...before she was married.

243
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,567
I didn't realize
it was public knowledge.

244
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,102
Queen and country, James.

245
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:58,639
Your job is to find out whether Carver
or someone in his organization...

246
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,800
...sent that ship off course
and why.

247
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,909
Use your relationship
with Mrs. Carver if necessary.

248
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:06,240
I doubt if she'll remember me.

249
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,211
Remind her.

250
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:11,784
Then pump her for information.

251
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:16,257
You'll just have to decide
how much pumping is needed, James.

252
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:19,690
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.

253
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,290
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.

254
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,966
It's the insurance damage waiver...

255
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:10,005
...for your beautiful new car.

256
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:13,700
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.

257
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:15,244
Fire?

258
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:17,514
Probably.

259
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:20,308
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.

260
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:22,043
Personal injury?

261
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,481
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

262
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,678
They frequently do with you.

263
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:32,323
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.

264
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:33,985
Do I need any other protection?

265
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:39,269
Only from me, 007, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order.

266
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,660
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

267
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:47,671
Your new BMW 750.

268
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:51,312
All the usual refinements.
Machine guns, rockets...

269
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,846
...the GPS tracking system.

270
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,317
<i>Welcome, Please fasten seat belt and
obey all instructions for a safe trip,</i>

271
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,218
I thought you'd pay more attention
to a female voice.

272
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,489
- I think we've met.
- I am not interested...

273
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,558
...in your sordid escapades.

274
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,593
Let's get on with it, shall we?

275
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,527
Your new telephone.

276
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,362
Talk here, listen here.

277
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,928
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.

278
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:22,038
It also includes
a fingerprint scanner...

279
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:25,040
...and a 20,000-volt
security system.

280
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:28,078
And this I'm particularly proud of:

281
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,076
The remote control for your car.

282
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,843
Tap twice.

283
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:34,578
One, two.

284
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,351
Now, draw your finger...

285
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:41,025
...very slowly across the pad...

286
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:44,089
...to drive the car.

287
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:52,470
It's surprisingly difficult to drive,
but with practice...

288
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:56,071
Well, let's see how she responds
to my touch, eh, Q?

289
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,595
I think we understand each other.

290
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,233
Grow up, 007.

291
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:45,150
<i>Attention, Engine running,
Please shut door now,</i>

292
00:30:57,665 --> 00:31:01,965
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumor...

293
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:04,603
...that I started running
Mad Cow Disease stories...

294
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:08,502
...simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron...

295
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:12,270
...lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.

296
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:16,039
Moreover, there's even
less truth in the rumor...

297
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:18,115
...that I took 100 million francs
from the French...

298
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:20,445
...to keep the stories running
for another year.

299
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,215
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver.
- Yes.

300
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:26,185
This is the new banker, Mr?

301
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:29,192
Bond. James Bond.

302
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:32,325
Another new banker.
I seem to collect them.

303
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:35,526
Tell me, Mr. Bond...

304
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:38,134
...how's the market reacting
to the crisis?

305
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:41,305
Well, currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

306
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,641
I don't believe we have met.

307
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:47,704
- Elliot Carver.
- Wai Lin.

308
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,005
I'm from the
New China News Agency.

309
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:52,204
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.

310
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:53,873
I have a confession.

311
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:57,350
It's not. I snuck in.

312
00:31:57,822 --> 00:31:59,948
Why would you do that, my dear?

313
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:01,988
I wanted to meet you.

314
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,850
Outstanding.

315
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:06,928
I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.

316
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:08,963
You should work in
my Beijing bureau.

317
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,497
Mr. Carver.

318
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,369
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing.
- Call me Elliot.

319
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:28,838
I always wondered how I'd feel
if I ever saw you again.

320
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:40,183
Now I know.

321
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:42,895
Was it something I said?

322
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:46,191
How about the words
"I'll be right back"?

323
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:52,003
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.

324
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:56,073
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.

325
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:57,904
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

326
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,036
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini,
shaken not stirred.

327
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:05,412
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila,
straight shot.

328
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:10,549
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.

329
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,949
I see you've moved up
in the world, Paris.

330
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:17,562
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

331
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,622
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

332
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,669
- To you.
- No, to the gun.

333
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:45,450
So I take it this isn't a social visit?

334
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:47,556
Your husband may be in trouble.

335
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:49,988
The emperor of the air.

336
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,627
If you think you're going after him,
you're the one who's in trouble.

337
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:56,492
Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.

338
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,863
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

339
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,799
No. That wasn't my plan.

340
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:05,270
Good. Because if it
comes to a choice...

341
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,705
...between you and Elliot,
I've made my bed.

342
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,208
You don't sleep in it anymore.

343
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:11,778
There you are.

344
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:15,772
Darling.

345
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:20,348
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

346
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:23,814
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

347
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:26,657
- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.

348
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,189
And this is James Bond.

349
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,862
I didn't realize you knew each other.

350
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,329
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.

351
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:36,731
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

352
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:41,634
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin
behind a news desk.

353
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:44,139
That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist...

354
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:46,803
...too much.

355
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,149
Tell me, Elliot, I was just
wondering about your satellites...

356
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:53,649
...the way you've positioned
yourself globally.

357
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,754
They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.

358
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,422
Or disinformation.

359
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:02,885
Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments or people.

360
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:04,920
Or even a ship.

361
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:09,866
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

362
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,628
You have a vivid imagination
for a banker.

363
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,170
Perhaps I should commission you
to write a novel.

364
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:20,174
Oh, heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

365
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,009
Mr. Carver?

366
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:30,880
It's time to begin the festivities.

367
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:32,419
Excuse me. Darling?

368
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:39,554
So how do you really know him?

369
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:42,562
I told you, he's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

370
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:45,029
You're a terrible liar, dear.

371
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:50,934
I have a problem with a banker.

372
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:53,097
Could I see you a moment?

373
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:56,710
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:03,773
Mr. Carver's broadcast will begin
in 10 minutes in the main studio.

375
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:09,321
Exactly what kind of banking
do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

376
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:14,394
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?

377
00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:27,270
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

378
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,773
It's nice to talk to the world.

379
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:35,144
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

380
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,316
Mr. Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.

381
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:49,093
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five...

382
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:53,729
...four, three, two...

383
00:36:53,932 --> 00:36:55,729
Good evening.

384
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:59,494
Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to be a celebration...

385
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:03,333
...marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.

386
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,974
But, as you're well aware...

387
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:09,135
...a terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea...

388
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:10,872
...which, unchecked...

389
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:16,677
...has the potential to destroy
every human being on Earth.

390
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:20,344
<i>- I want to assure my viewers that I,,,
- This way, please.</i>

391
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:23,821
<i>,,, Elliot Carver, have spoken
with the prime minister in London,,,</i>

392
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,824
<i>,,, and the chairman in Beijing,,,</i>

393
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:28,520
<i>,,, and have offered my services
as an impartial...</i>

394
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:35,028
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.

395
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:43,300
<i>Herr Stamper,
we have made contact.</i>

396
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,912
Make him uncomfortable.

397
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:48,275
I'll be there in a few moments.

398
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:51,714
- with its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day...

399
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:55,014
...and its satellite facilities
linking every last...

400
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:02,152
You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.

401
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,661
He wants to know why.

402
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:09,334
<i>Why did I do it, you ask,</i>

403
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:12,403
<i>The answer is simple: power,</i>

404
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,331
<i>The power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe,</i>

405
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,306
<i>Not for higher profits,,,</i>

406
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:22,845
...but for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

407
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:25,677
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play
a little number on his head.

408
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:35,452
<i>And what do I expect in return?</i>

409
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:38,218
Worldwide domination.

410
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:42,456
<i>Complete, utter, total
worldwide domination,</i>

411
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,760
<i>But not over governments or ideology,</i>

412
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,407
<i>Over tyranny and isolation
and ignorance,</i>

413
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,576
<i>The Carver Media Group Network
has the ability,,,</i>

414
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:58,737
<i>,,, to reach every person
in every village in every nation,</i>

415
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,849
<i>But do not fear me,,,</i>

416
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:03,451
<i>,,, for tonight I offer you
my declaration of principles:</i>

417
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:06,787
<i>A promise to the men and women
of this planet,,,</i>

418
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,292
<i>,,, my brothers and sisters
whom I so humbly serve,</i>

419
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:15,556
<i>I promise to report the news
without fear or favor,</i>

420
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:19,131
<i>I promise to be a force
for good in this world,</i>

421
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,803
<i>Fighting injustice,
crushing intolerance,,,</i>

422
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:24,130
<i>,,, battling inhumanity,</i>

423
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:28,241
<i>- Striking a blow for freedom,
- It's time for...</i>

424
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,178
...a station break.

425
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,582
- What's happening?
- We've lost power.

426
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:38,809
- We're off the air.
- What?!

427
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:49,759
Ladies and gentlemen, stay calm.
There's no need to go for the exit.

428
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,160
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

429
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:55,800
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're fired! Get out of my sight!

430
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:44,703
<i>And, in a rather embarrassing note,,,</i>

431
00:40:44,948 --> 00:40:48,475
<i>,,, scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight,,,</i>

432
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:51,051
<i>,,, in mid-speech during
the inaugural broadcast,,,</i>

433
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,951
<i>,,, of his Worldwide Satellite Network,</i>

434
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:56,648
<i>Sorry, Elliot,
but we didn't do it,</i>

435
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:01,328
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

436
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,657
Come on, Elliot.
Ignore those people.

437
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:06,390
- Sometimes these things happen.
- Not to me.

438
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:08,826
Not to me!

439
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:22,412
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

440
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:27,916
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.

441
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:31,547
The key to a great story
is not who...

442
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:34,193
...or what or when...

443
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:37,029
...but why.

444
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:42,531
Your friend, Mr. Bond,
made a mess tonight.

445
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:47,696
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.

446
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:51,210
Barely?

447
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,799
I was curious
who Carver would send.

448
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,431
He's on to you.

449
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:28,970
Well, we know where you stand.

450
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,811
You made your bed.

451
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,085
I'm standing in your doorway.

452
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,453
Then turn around and go home.

453
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,686
You can tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

454
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:51,498
That's it? Go home?

455
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:55,864
I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.

456
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:58,334
It's too late for that.

457
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:08,645
Why did you marry him?

458
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,645
He told me he loved me.

459
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:14,179
That always sounds good.

460
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:19,524
Do you know I used to look in
the papers for your obituary?

461
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,528
Well, I'm sorry
I keep disappointing you.

462
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,865
What was it, James?

463
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:37,873
Did I get too close?

464
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:45,016
Did I get too close for comfort?

465
00:43:57,362 --> 00:43:58,760
Yes.

466
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,441
I missed you.

467
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:56,743
What did you find?

468
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:58,782
I hacked into the mainframe
at the bank.

469
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:01,387
They're using
an SSL2 encryption, 128...

470
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:04,581
Spare me the technobabble, please.

471
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:07,249
Bond's got a perfect
employment record. Ten years.

472
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:09,794
He's crossed every T,
he's dotted every I.

473
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:11,988
- Which means?
- Government agent.

474
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:15,065
I call it
Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.

475
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:18,430
If it sounds too good to be true,
it always is.

476
00:45:19,705 --> 00:45:21,764
Do you think my wife knows?

477
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:28,439
There's a lot of garbage, but
if you dial down the ambient noise...

478
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:33,851
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?</i>

479
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:37,282
Play it again.

480
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:41,789
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?</i>

481
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:47,321
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.

482
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:58,469
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?</i>

483
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:08,477
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

484
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:11,175
I can get you out of the country
in four hours.

485
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,752
I have no choice.

486
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:16,254
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

487
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:20,155
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.

488
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:22,263
I can't do that.

489
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,666
He has a secret lab on the top floor
even I'm not supposed to know about.

490
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:30,668
There's an emergency hatch
on the roof.

491
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,965
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.

492
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:34,970
Don't argue with me, James.

493
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:38,911
You know...

494
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:42,315
...this job of yours...

495
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,018
...it's murder on relationships.

496
00:48:08,364 --> 00:48:10,797
Until I get back next week,
I want two guards...

497
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:13,627
...outside this office
24 hours a day.

498
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:15,802
Nobody gets in. Got it?

499
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,767
We'll take care of it.

500
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:23,000
What do we do with the satellite?

501
00:48:25,146 --> 00:48:27,910
Send this thing to the launch site.
And be careful.

502
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:32,177
It's worth $300 million. You break it,
you bought it. Understand?

503
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,887
I hate traveling.
I never know what to pack.

504
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:16,717
Looking for a news story?

505
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:28,731
They'll print anything these days.

506
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:33,098
Yes?

507
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:37,101
<i>Good morning, Mr, Bond,
Elliot Carver,</i>

508
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:40,467
<i>I believe you've got
two items that belong to me,</i>

509
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,572
What are you talking about?

510
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:45,609
<i>The red box, Mr, Bond,,,</i>

511
00:53:45,812 --> 00:53:48,747
<i>,,, and my wife in your hotel room,</i>

512
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:02,889
He's coming.

513
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,233
<i>Fingerprint ID accepted,</i>

514
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:19,777
<i>Please select security system level,</i>

515
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:45,293
Tell me if you find the encoder.

516
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,936
<i>- Call me immediately,
- Yeah,</i>

517
00:55:00,848 --> 00:55:02,874
<i>And in breaking news,,,</i>

518
00:55:03,118 --> 00:55:07,850
<i>,,, it is with great sadness that we
announce the death of Paris Carver,,,</i>

519
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:10,991
<i>,,, who has become an international
figure since she became the wife,,,</i>

520
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,322
<i>,,, of Elliot Carver,
chairman of this network,</i>

521
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:17,328
<i>According to police officials
in Hamburg, Germany,,,</i>

522
00:55:17,532 --> 00:55:19,966
<i>,,, Mrs, Carver was found dead
this morning,,,</i>

523
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:23,864
<i>,,, in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances,,,</i>

524
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:26,535
<i>,,, on which police
have refused to elaborate,</i>

525
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:29,567
<i>A coroner has been called for
and is expected to deliver,,,</i>

526
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:33,040
<i>,,, his full report within
the next three days,</i>

527
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:36,841
<i>Her body was discovered along with
the body of an unidentified man,,,</i>

528
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,075
<i>,,, who appeared to be the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound,</i>

529
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:42,447
<i>Reached aboard his private jet
en route...</i>

530
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:45,556
I have a clear shot at your head,
Mr. Bond.

531
00:55:46,391 --> 00:55:49,326
Stand up, slowly.

532
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:52,122
<i>Drop your gun and
kick it toward me, ja?</i>

533
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:55,259
<i>At present, police
have refused to speculate,,,</i>

534
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:56,991
<i>,,, on a motive in this
murder-suicide,</i>

535
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:58,930
Good. Now...

536
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:01,662
...lie down on the bed
next to Mrs. Carver.

537
00:56:02,006 --> 00:56:05,566
<i>We extend our deepest sympathies
to Mr, Carver,</i>

538
00:56:07,912 --> 00:56:10,244
This story will be
on the news in an hour.

539
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:14,439
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.

540
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,586
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

541
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:27,028
I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.

542
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,288
<i>Take my word for it, ja?</i>

543
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,369
Get the sledgehammers.

544
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,483
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.

545
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,978
It's a pity you got her
involved in all this.

546
00:56:57,792 --> 00:57:00,385
It won't look like a suicide
if you shoot me from over there.

547
00:57:00,594 --> 00:57:03,153
I am a professor
of forensic medicine.

548
00:57:03,396 --> 00:57:05,831
Believe me, Mr. Bond,
I could shoot you from Stuttgart...

549
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,467
...and still create the proper effect.

550
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:19,544
My art is in great demand,
Mr. Bond.

551
00:57:19,712 --> 00:57:21,543
I go all over the world.

552
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:26,111
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.

553
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:30,952
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond,
that our little...

554
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:35,849
<i>Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, ja?</i>

555
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,427
Sir, they can't get into the car.

556
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:40,987
You can't be serious.

557
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:44,735
<i>- Did you call the Auto Club?
- Do you wanna call them?</i>

558
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:46,801
<i>Make him tell you how to open it,</i>

559
00:57:46,972 --> 00:57:48,836
Okay, I ask.

560
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:52,675
This is very embarrassing.

561
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:54,969
It seems there is
a red box in your car.

562
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:56,907
They can't get to it.

563
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,949
They want me
to make you unlock the car.

564
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:03,813
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.

565
00:58:06,054 --> 00:58:08,681
I am to torture you
if you don't do it.

566
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:12,019
- You have a doctorate in that too?
- No, no, no.

567
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:15,923
This is more like a hobby.
But I'm very gifted.

568
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:18,428
Oh, I believe you.

569
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,232
- My cell phone opens the car.
- No, Mr. Bond.

570
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,325
<i>I do it, ja?</i>

571
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,669
Recall, three, send.

572
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:43,012
Wait.

573
00:58:43,188 --> 00:58:45,952
I'm just a professional doing a job.

574
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:48,349
Me too.

575
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:18,612
Dr. Kaufman.

576
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:52,750
<i>Welcome, Please fasten seat belt,</i>

577
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:02,327
<i>Reduce speed,
Pedestrians in roadway,</i>

578
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:09,317
<i>Driver alert,</i>

579
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:11,723
<i>Obstruction ahead,
Reduce speed now,</i>

580
01:02:33,304 --> 01:02:36,761
<i>Reminder:
Unsafe driving will void warranty,</i>

581
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,344
<i>Congratulations on a safe journey,</i>

582
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:51,701
Yo! Jimbo!

583
01:03:51,878 --> 01:03:53,812
Wade, what are you doing here?

584
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:56,845
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.

585
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:58,881
Did Q bring you up to speed?

586
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,883
Yeah. I brought along
the GPS calibration unit.

587
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:06,752
By the way, officially Uncle Sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot.

588
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:08,255
And unofficially?

589
01:04:08,494 --> 01:04:11,484
We have no interest in seeing
World War III, unless we start it.

590
01:04:11,662 --> 01:04:15,155
Dr. Greenwalt.
He's the Air Force GPS expert.

591
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:16,891
Sorry about all this security...

592
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:20,229
...but the GPS encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets...

593
01:04:20,404 --> 01:04:21,735
...in the U.S. military.

594
01:04:21,906 --> 01:04:23,670
Show him what you got.

595
01:04:27,912 --> 01:04:30,904
Jesus, it's the missing encoder.
How the hell did you get that?

596
01:04:31,115 --> 01:04:33,583
Picked it up in Hamburg
yesterday morning.

597
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:37,015
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off course?

598
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,686
<i>- Like the Devonshire?
- Whoa!</i>

599
01:04:38,854 --> 01:04:41,187
<i>I didn't hear anybody mention
the Devonshire, Did you?</i>

600
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:43,849
- No.
- Good. So just answer his question.

601
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:47,519
Well, in theory, if you could alter
the timing chip...

602
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:50,063
...you could slowly
send a ship off course.

603
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,200
Like putting a magnet
near a compass.

604
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:53,596
Yeah, exactly.

605
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:56,398
- Then check this out.
- Oh, yeah.

606
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:11,282
Those two circles should be
lining up on top of each other.

607
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:14,046
Somebody's tampered
with your encoder.

608
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:19,086
<i>If we knew the last time and position
the Devonshire thought she was...</i>

609
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:21,922
...could you figure out
exactly where she sank?

610
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,461
Sure.

611
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,061
- Wade?
- Yeah?

612
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:29,224
I have a small favor to ask.

613
01:05:35,909 --> 01:05:38,742
The high-altitude,
low-opening jump, the HALO jump...

614
01:05:38,945 --> 01:05:41,971
...is where we get the most fatalities,
so listen up.

615
01:05:42,181 --> 01:05:46,345
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your
oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

616
01:05:46,585 --> 01:05:48,075
Sounds like my first marriage.

617
01:05:48,788 --> 01:05:50,153
Next, after the free-fall...

618
01:05:50,323 --> 01:05:52,916
...pop the chute at 200 feet,
below the Chinese radar.

619
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:54,922
You'll be traveling
at over 200 miles an hour.

620
01:05:55,093 --> 01:05:56,924
This snaps your head back
like a cantaloupe.

621
01:05:57,095 --> 01:05:59,562
Don't crack your skull open
on the tanks.

622
01:05:59,763 --> 01:06:01,197
I'll keep that in mind.

623
01:06:01,366 --> 01:06:04,824
One last thing: When you hit the water,
don't forget to cut away your chute.

624
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,300
Ninety percent of people
killed in HALO jumps...

625
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:10,964
...got tangled up in their chutes
and drowned. Got it?

626
01:06:11,142 --> 01:06:13,268
Seems like a lot
just to save the world.

627
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:14,843
I've got no choice.

628
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:18,014
I have to prove that ship
was deliberately sent off course.

629
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:20,313
- One minute!
- Is the pickup set?

630
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:22,883
You bet. After your mission,
turn on your beacon.

631
01:06:23,086 --> 01:06:25,487
The extraction team
will pick you up after dark.

632
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,223
Buddha bless!

633
01:06:30,026 --> 01:06:32,153
- I just noticed something.
- Yeah?

634
01:06:32,896 --> 01:06:34,886
This is where the ship
thought it was.

635
01:06:35,098 --> 01:06:37,965
This is where it really is.
But see that island?

636
01:06:38,134 --> 01:06:40,795
- Yeah.
- That means where he's jumping...

637
01:06:41,004 --> 01:06:43,029
...between the British
and Chinese fleets...

638
01:06:43,205 --> 01:06:45,969
Technically they're not
in Chinese territorial waters.

639
01:06:46,141 --> 01:06:48,608
- They belong to Vietnam.
- Vietnam?

640
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:51,836
Does he have any
U.S. government markings on him?

641
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:54,105
The parachute,
the wet suit, the fins.

642
01:06:54,315 --> 01:06:57,342
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.

643
01:07:02,823 --> 01:07:04,814
He didn't even say goodbye.

644
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:26,470
Still interested in hostile takeovers?

645
01:11:27,404 --> 01:11:30,669
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.

646
01:11:50,459 --> 01:11:52,261
Get them out of the water.

647
01:12:06,676 --> 01:12:11,112
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were following me around, Mr. Bond.

648
01:12:11,313 --> 01:12:13,109
You'll have to admit, though...

649
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,306
...we seem to have developed
a certain attachment to each other.

650
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:19,475
Hopefully not for long.

651
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:25,852
Another Carver building.

652
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,620
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.

653
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:51,147
General Chang?

654
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:53,045
Friend of yours?

655
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:58,153
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

656
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:01,557
Welcome to Saigon.

657
01:13:01,727 --> 01:13:03,523
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.

658
01:13:04,528 --> 01:13:07,156
I hadn't intended opening
this center until tomorrow...

659
01:13:07,365 --> 01:13:11,062
...but as you're here you can help me
write the inaugural story:

660
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:12,759
Your obituaries.

661
01:13:13,003 --> 01:13:15,665
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.

662
01:13:17,607 --> 01:13:21,874
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary...

663
01:13:22,046 --> 01:13:23,774
...when you asked her to betray me.

664
01:13:25,515 --> 01:13:26,914
Still, let's see.

665
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,179
"British secret service agent
James Bond...

666
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:32,252
...and his collaborator Wai Lin...

667
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:35,353
...of the Chinese People's
External Security Force...

668
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:37,681
...were found...

669
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,021
...dead this morning...

670
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,424
...in Vietnam.

671
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:46,792
Lacks punch, don't you think?

672
01:13:47,136 --> 01:13:48,933
It's old news, Elliot.

673
01:13:49,104 --> 01:13:50,900
We've been working together
for months.

674
01:13:51,072 --> 01:13:53,905
Both our governments know what you
and General Chang are up to.

675
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,774
I don't think so.

676
01:13:57,944 --> 01:14:00,106
You may have seen the general
in the hallway just now...

677
01:14:00,281 --> 01:14:02,374
...but perhaps,
with all your jetting around...

678
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:05,541
...you've not had chance to peruse
today's headlines.

679
01:14:11,124 --> 01:14:14,525
I rather like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

680
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:16,663
I never believe what I read
in the press anyway.

681
01:14:17,631 --> 01:14:19,894
Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.

682
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:24,400
You see, we're both men of action,
but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.

683
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:28,095
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.

684
01:14:28,274 --> 01:14:32,175
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?

685
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:33,742
Exactly!

686
01:14:33,913 --> 01:14:36,609
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies...

687
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,751
...I have my divisions.
TV, news, magazines.

688
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:44,913
And by midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people...

689
01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:48,650
...than anyone in the history
of this planet, save God Himself.

690
01:14:49,594 --> 01:14:52,426
And the best he ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.

691
01:14:52,596 --> 01:14:53,995
You really are quite insane.

692
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:58,329
The distance
between insanity and genius...

693
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:00,298
...is measured only by success.

694
01:15:01,071 --> 01:15:02,436
Excuse me.

695
01:15:02,606 --> 01:15:06,098
- General Chang is waiting.
- lf you'll forgive me...

696
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:09,833
Your appearance here has forced me
to move up my timetable slightly.

697
01:15:10,012 --> 01:15:13,846
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

698
01:15:14,016 --> 01:15:15,347
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

699
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:19,382
- Sir. The helicopter.
- Thanks, Gupta.

700
01:15:19,588 --> 01:15:22,490
Mr. Stamper is a protégé
of the late Dr. Kaufman...

701
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:26,183
...who was schooling him in
the ancient art of chakra torture.

702
01:15:27,128 --> 01:15:28,720
He was like a father to me.

703
01:15:28,964 --> 01:15:31,957
Really? Interesting role model.

704
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:35,135
According to Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points.

705
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:38,404
Energy centers,
like the heart or genitals.

706
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,836
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs...

707
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,135
...inflicting the maximum amount
of pain...

708
01:15:44,512 --> 01:15:47,345
...whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.

709
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:49,914
Dr. Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.

710
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:52,813
I'm hoping to break it.

711
01:15:53,888 --> 01:15:56,550
I would've thought watching
your TV shows was torture enough.

712
01:15:58,058 --> 01:15:59,388
Save this one till last.

713
01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:02,528
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

714
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:06,756
...there should just be enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.

715
01:16:06,999 --> 01:16:08,261
Excuse me.

716
01:16:37,361 --> 01:16:38,794
Go! Go! Go! Go!

717
01:16:46,304 --> 01:16:48,362
We can use the banner.

718
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:52,866
Hope it holds.

719
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,477
- Get after them!
- Ready? Go!

720
01:17:22,402 --> 01:17:24,200
Next time I'll take the elevator.

721
01:17:29,142 --> 01:17:30,973
Push! Push!

722
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,527
- Get a car!
- No, no!

723
01:17:52,732 --> 01:17:55,725
- Yes, a car!
- A bike is quicker.

724
01:17:56,369 --> 01:17:58,269
The keys.
Someone always forgets them.

725
01:17:58,437 --> 01:18:00,962
What are you doing?
I'm driving. Get off.

726
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:04,041
Get on the back.

727
01:18:06,945 --> 01:18:08,537
I'm slipping.

728
01:18:11,515 --> 01:18:13,507
Stop fidgeting back there.

729
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,282
What are you...?

730
01:18:17,488 --> 01:18:18,853
Give me that.

731
01:18:19,056 --> 01:18:20,957
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

732
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:22,649
- Turn right.
- No, left.

733
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,657
Who's driving? Come on!

734
01:18:56,558 --> 01:18:57,581
Clutch!

735
01:19:03,832 --> 01:19:05,196
Left! Left!

736
01:19:08,436 --> 01:19:09,927
How many back there?

737
01:19:10,172 --> 01:19:12,002
I can't see. Hold on.

738
01:19:14,909 --> 01:19:16,433
What are you...? What?

739
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:22,006
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.

740
01:19:24,084 --> 01:19:25,608
One. No, two.

741
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,324
- Go for the barrels.
- What?

742
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,129
Very good.

743
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:00,114
Hold on!

744
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:09,952
Let's take the highway.

745
01:20:30,147 --> 01:20:32,741
- Helicopter!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

746
01:21:19,726 --> 01:21:22,717
- Get on the back of the bike.
- Are you trying to protect me?

747
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:25,294
No. I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.

748
01:21:34,339 --> 01:21:35,738
- You ready?
- Yeah.

749
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,305
Go!

750
01:21:50,554 --> 01:21:52,079
Pop the clutch.

751
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:24,776
- It's behind us.
- Move!

752
01:22:27,089 --> 01:22:28,784
Get out of the way!

753
01:22:59,953 --> 01:23:01,818
You see the chopper?

754
01:23:03,089 --> 01:23:05,523
I can't see. Hold on.

755
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:11,455
What are you...?

756
01:23:24,976 --> 01:23:26,568
Trapped.

757
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:29,907
Never.

758
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:19,960
Would you pass the soap?

759
01:24:23,398 --> 01:24:25,296
Over there.

760
01:24:28,535 --> 01:24:31,026
You were pretty good
with that hook.

761
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:34,332
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.

762
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:36,673
You were pretty good
on the bike.

763
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:40,677
Well, that comes from
not growing up at all.

764
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,712
Here. Allow me.

765
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:46,651
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

766
01:24:46,853 --> 01:24:49,754
Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.

767
01:24:51,624 --> 01:24:52,920
Work hand in hand?

768
01:24:53,158 --> 01:24:56,389
Stick closer to each other.

769
01:24:56,628 --> 01:24:59,154
Maybe we go after
General Chang together.

770
01:25:00,665 --> 01:25:02,189
Your turn.

771
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:04,198
Thanks for washing my hair.

772
01:25:05,637 --> 01:25:07,537
I work alone.

773
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:40,172
Lucky for you I stopped by.

774
01:27:41,284 --> 01:27:43,217
I could've taken care of him.

775
01:27:46,388 --> 01:27:49,016
But you didn't.
Give me the earring.

776
01:27:50,925 --> 01:27:55,794
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue, Chinese army.

777
01:27:56,096 --> 01:27:58,087
Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.

778
01:27:58,332 --> 01:28:00,357
You still think
you can do this alone?

779
01:28:00,935 --> 01:28:03,903
It depends whether your mission
is peace or revenge.

780
01:28:04,103 --> 01:28:06,402
This is about stopping a war.

781
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:14,512
Last year we found
stealth material was missing...

782
01:28:14,714 --> 01:28:16,841
...from one of
General Chang's bases.

783
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,381
I followed a lead
to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.

784
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,052
Stealth material?

785
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,051
We thought he was building
a stealth plane.

786
01:28:24,623 --> 01:28:27,251
No. Stealth boat.

787
01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:29,394
<i>That's the only way they could
get close to the Devonshire,,,</i>

788
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:31,756
...so they could drill inside
the missile room.

789
01:28:32,531 --> 01:28:35,625
Remember? They stole
a cruise missile from that ship.

790
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:38,596
He said he was moving the timetable
forward to midnight.

791
01:28:38,836 --> 01:28:40,736
Yes, of course he did.

792
01:28:40,938 --> 01:28:43,099
Under cover of darkness
he'll position the stealth boat...

793
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:44,900
...near the British fleet...

794
01:28:45,108 --> 01:28:47,600
...fire the missile into China.

795
01:28:47,845 --> 01:28:51,541
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.

796
01:28:52,482 --> 01:28:54,246
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.

797
01:28:54,452 --> 01:28:56,818
Let's warn both our governments,
get them talking.

798
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:58,722
It'll give us time to find the boat.

799
01:28:59,122 --> 01:29:00,851
Stand up.

800
01:29:22,478 --> 01:29:23,604
It's just like home.

801
01:29:23,779 --> 01:29:25,939
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

802
01:29:31,919 --> 01:29:34,911
On second thought, you type.

803
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:37,182
First we have to find the boat.

804
01:29:38,926 --> 01:29:42,521
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang...

805
01:29:42,697 --> 01:29:45,530
...22 are in
highly populated areas.

806
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,190
That leaves 14
where he could hide a stealth boat.

807
01:29:48,435 --> 01:29:50,198
You can see it during the day.

808
01:29:50,404 --> 01:29:52,805
It's invisible to radar,
but not the human eye.

809
01:29:55,908 --> 01:29:57,034
Very novel.

810
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:00,169
He'd have to hide it
someplace where...

811
01:30:00,346 --> 01:30:02,541
<i>...he could sail to the Devonshire
and back in one night.</i>

812
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,476
This looks familiar.

813
01:30:06,185 --> 01:30:09,348
- We've made some improvements.
- Have you, indeed?

814
01:30:09,555 --> 01:30:13,650
Okay. Four hours out
and four hours back.

815
01:30:14,192 --> 01:30:17,788
Assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.

816
01:30:20,464 --> 01:30:23,195
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.

817
01:30:24,436 --> 01:30:25,994
According to this...

818
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:28,832
...there are four places
where he could harbor the boat.

819
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:30,735
Up on your left.

820
01:30:32,877 --> 01:30:35,936
Run a cross-check on those areas
for anything suspicious.

821
01:30:42,953 --> 01:30:44,977
Ah, the new Walther.

822
01:30:45,188 --> 01:30:47,179
I asked Q to get me one of these.

823
01:31:00,236 --> 01:31:02,465
I've got it. Look.

824
01:31:03,773 --> 01:31:06,435
Four missing boats.
Three unexplained drownings.

825
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:07,769
That has to be it.

826
01:31:09,877 --> 01:31:11,777
Ha Long Bay.

827
01:31:28,629 --> 01:31:30,096
He knows the island.

828
01:31:30,264 --> 01:31:33,995
He says that it's dangerous for
boats to be around there at sunset...

829
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:37,135
...but for 5000 American dollars...

830
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:39,895
...he'll take us.
- Good.

831
01:31:40,106 --> 01:31:42,006
Maybe he'll take a check.

832
01:31:57,022 --> 01:31:59,320
It's mostly dull routine,
of course...

833
01:31:59,558 --> 01:32:03,323
...but every now and then you get to
sail on a beautiful evening like this...

834
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:07,793
...and sometimes work with a decadent
agent of a corrupt Western power.

835
01:32:08,032 --> 01:32:10,432
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.

836
01:32:11,969 --> 01:32:13,300
I hate to disappoint you...

837
01:32:13,771 --> 01:32:15,830
...but I don't even have
a little red book.

838
01:32:19,444 --> 01:32:21,275
If anything happens to me...

839
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:23,844
...the fuses for the mines
are in here.

840
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,084
We're gonna finish this together.

841
01:32:29,286 --> 01:32:32,118
And if I may say so,
you found the right...

842
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:35,780
...decadent, corrupt Western agent...

843
01:32:35,959 --> 01:32:37,653
...as a partner.

844
01:32:57,779 --> 01:32:59,804
- See the stealth?
- No.

845
01:33:00,615 --> 01:33:03,584
It's getting late
and this is the last cove in the bay.

846
01:33:11,992 --> 01:33:13,893
Yeah, that's it.

847
01:33:43,355 --> 01:33:44,686
Set the timers for 10 minutes.

848
01:33:44,856 --> 01:33:47,757
That'll give us time to get out of
here before the ship explodes.

849
01:33:47,926 --> 01:33:50,486
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.

850
01:33:50,695 --> 01:33:53,527
- Our fleets will finish the job.
- lf they got our message.

851
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:57,031
- Okay, you, up and over.
- Okay.

852
01:34:12,448 --> 01:34:14,348
<i>We're in position
between the fleets,</i>

853
01:34:14,851 --> 01:34:18,582
Fire one missile
at the flagship of each fleet.

854
01:34:18,789 --> 01:34:22,554
The Chinese will think the British
are rattling the saber...

855
01:34:22,759 --> 01:34:26,285
...the British will think the Chinese
are being belligerent...

856
01:34:26,528 --> 01:34:30,397
...and the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

857
01:34:32,467 --> 01:34:34,593
Let the mayhem begin.

858
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,108
Missile lock-on.

859
01:34:46,281 --> 01:34:50,478
Send a signal to the Admiralty:
"Task group under missile attack."

860
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:55,551
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MiG 21 s inbound.

861
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,282
The first group should be
on our screens in two minutes.

862
01:34:58,458 --> 01:35:02,554
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?

863
01:35:02,729 --> 01:35:03,753
Twelve minutes.

864
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:07,495
What the hell do I pay you for?

865
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:13,704
If she's there, Bond is there.

866
01:35:13,906 --> 01:35:15,305
Stamper, find them.

867
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,010
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!

868
01:35:33,425 --> 01:35:35,085
If she blinks, kill her.

869
01:35:35,526 --> 01:35:37,016
You come with me.

870
01:36:23,338 --> 01:36:26,273
<i>Stamper to Bridge, Bond is dead,</i>

871
01:36:26,474 --> 01:36:27,736
Delicious.

872
01:36:27,909 --> 01:36:31,174
Make sure you clear all the mines,
and bring the girl up to me.

873
01:36:36,684 --> 01:36:38,709
Are you sure you want her up here?

874
01:36:39,687 --> 01:36:41,552
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

875
01:36:41,789 --> 01:36:43,415
I like an audience.

876
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:51,529
Ah, Miss Lin.

877
01:36:52,031 --> 01:36:54,694
Your countrymen are being
so cooperative...

878
01:36:54,868 --> 01:36:57,199
...so predictably eager
to save face.

879
01:36:57,370 --> 01:37:00,533
My government knows you're
out here. They're looking for you.

880
01:37:01,542 --> 01:37:03,441
Not according to our radar...

881
01:37:03,608 --> 01:37:07,908
...where it seems your MiGs are
about to attack the British fleet...

882
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,605
...in how many minutes?

883
01:37:09,848 --> 01:37:11,748
Nine minutes to firing range.

884
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:14,442
And even if they were
looking for me...

885
01:37:14,686 --> 01:37:16,085
...we're on a stealth boat.

886
01:37:17,589 --> 01:37:20,057
They can't see me, or you...

887
01:37:20,225 --> 01:37:22,250
...or even your friend...

888
01:37:22,427 --> 01:37:23,916
...the late Commander Bond...

889
01:37:24,095 --> 01:37:29,123
...who is at this moment on his way
to the bottom of the South China Sea.

890
01:37:29,633 --> 01:37:31,532
He's my new anchorman.

891
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:45,748
Pathetic.

892
01:37:50,154 --> 01:37:52,246
What on earth's going on?

893
01:37:52,455 --> 01:37:54,684
A message from 007...

894
01:37:54,923 --> 01:37:57,686
...just confirmed by
my opposite number in China.

895
01:37:57,925 --> 01:38:02,124
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship
that's almost invisible to radar."

896
01:38:03,065 --> 01:38:04,622
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

897
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:08,136
Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.

898
01:38:10,372 --> 01:38:13,169
Admiral, sir,
urgent message from the Admiralty.

899
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:16,804
Look at this.

900
01:38:18,379 --> 01:38:22,679
Anything on radar that looks small?
Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

901
01:38:22,917 --> 01:38:26,286
- No, sir.
- Stealth boat, sir? They've gone mad.

902
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:38,190
What you're about to witness, Miss
Lin, is not so much a missile attack...

903
01:38:38,365 --> 01:38:40,265
...but the launch
of a new world order.

904
01:38:40,467 --> 01:38:45,267
In five minutes, after your countrymen
have attacked the British fleet...

905
01:38:45,436 --> 01:38:48,338
I shall retaliate
for dear old England...

906
01:38:48,574 --> 01:38:51,270
...by sending this missile
into Beijing...

907
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:54,769
...where General Chang has just
called an emergency meeting...

908
01:38:54,979 --> 01:38:57,005
...of the Chinese high command.

909
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:58,706
Unfortunately...

910
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:03,313
...General Chang
will be delayed in traffic...

911
01:39:03,856 --> 01:39:08,189
...arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders...

912
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:13,125
...and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.

913
01:39:14,531 --> 01:39:18,524
But he'll be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce...

914
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:21,330
...and emerge as a world leader...

915
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:23,972
...with the Nobel Peace Prize.

916
01:39:24,174 --> 01:39:26,233
- And what do you get?
- Me?

917
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:29,543
Oh, nothing.

918
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:34,740
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next hundred years.

919
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,479
Ready to rock and ruin.

920
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:43,688
If you'll excuse me, my dear,
I have a deadline to meet.

921
01:39:43,893 --> 01:39:45,326
Prepare for the missile launch.

922
01:39:49,164 --> 01:39:50,256
Mr. Gupta.

923
01:39:50,832 --> 01:39:52,698
Hello, Elliot.

924
01:39:52,902 --> 01:39:54,766
Interesting plan.

925
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:57,602
<i>But I think I have
something that belongs to you,</i>

926
01:39:57,772 --> 01:40:00,899
So much for German efficiency.
Mr. Stamper.

927
01:40:10,284 --> 01:40:12,445
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.

928
01:40:14,554 --> 01:40:16,853
Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr. Bond.

929
01:40:17,591 --> 01:40:19,115
Even trade, Elliot.

930
01:40:19,293 --> 01:40:21,021
Gupta for Wai Lin.

931
01:40:21,194 --> 01:40:23,253
You can't fire the missile
without him.

932
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:26,965
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

933
01:40:27,799 --> 01:40:30,563
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

934
01:40:30,769 --> 01:40:33,796
I told you we're going to
finish this together.

935
01:40:34,407 --> 01:40:35,873
How romantic.

936
01:40:36,775 --> 01:40:40,040
Do you realize
how absurd your position is?

937
01:40:40,245 --> 01:40:42,805
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.

938
01:40:43,048 --> 01:40:47,883
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.

939
01:40:48,086 --> 01:40:51,111
Look at William Randolph Hearst,
who told his photographers:

940
01:40:51,288 --> 01:40:54,746
"You provide the pictures,
I'll provide the war."

941
01:40:54,959 --> 01:40:57,052
I've just taken it one step further.

942
01:41:01,499 --> 01:41:03,159
Sorry about that.

943
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:05,632
I tuned out there
for a moment, Elliot.

944
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:07,464
Touché.

945
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:09,764
Mr. Gupta...

946
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:11,600
...is the missile ready to fire?

947
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:14,107
Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.

948
01:41:15,312 --> 01:41:18,279
Then it seems
you've outlived your contract.

949
01:41:20,849 --> 01:41:23,716
You see, Mr. Bond,
I have a backup plan.

950
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,612
So do I.

951
01:41:50,443 --> 01:41:52,604
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

952
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,307
Sir, we have a small,
intermittent contact on the surface.

953
01:41:56,516 --> 01:41:59,246
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

954
01:41:59,452 --> 01:42:03,445
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear
it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

955
01:42:03,657 --> 01:42:07,683
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on the
Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

956
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:10,454
Send the message
to the Chinese fleet commander:

957
01:42:10,629 --> 01:42:12,028
"Have sighted unknown ship..."

958
01:42:12,197 --> 01:42:14,961
Get those fires out!

959
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,134
Get down there
and protect the missile.

960
01:42:17,335 --> 01:42:21,773
Oh, and Mr. Stamper,
would you please kill those bastards?

961
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:40,416
Nice work.

962
01:42:43,828 --> 01:42:45,818
They're speeding up.

963
01:42:46,029 --> 01:42:49,157
- We have to stop the boat.
- Can you take care of the engine room?

964
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,665
- Of course.
- Good. Do it and get off the ship.

965
01:42:53,804 --> 01:42:55,431
I'm going to stop the missile.

966
01:43:05,614 --> 01:43:08,379
Signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.

967
01:43:09,352 --> 01:43:11,115
"To Royal Navy Task Group:

968
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,083
We also have the unknown ship
on our screens.

969
01:43:14,255 --> 01:43:16,622
We will not fire
unless it turns towards China.

970
01:43:16,826 --> 01:43:19,123
Until then, she's yours.
Good hunting."

971
01:43:19,361 --> 01:43:22,524
Now, captain, whatever
the hell that thing is, sink it.

972
01:43:22,731 --> 01:43:26,063
Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?

973
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:27,460
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

974
01:43:27,635 --> 01:43:29,626
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

975
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:39,274
Bond turned us into the target.

976
01:43:39,747 --> 01:43:41,339
Along with himself.

977
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:43,607
Take evasive action.

978
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:46,412
Prepare the missile countdown
immediately.

979
01:43:46,619 --> 01:43:51,056
Initializing launch sequence.
T minus five minutes and counting.

980
01:43:51,257 --> 01:43:54,623
<i>T minus five minutes and counting,</i>

981
01:43:54,793 --> 01:43:56,819
Sir, they're making 48 knots.

982
01:43:56,996 --> 01:43:59,463
They'll be out of range
in two minutes.

983
01:43:59,665 --> 01:44:01,599
Keep firing. Slow them down.

984
01:45:04,125 --> 01:45:07,526
The engines are out. We're sitting
ducks here. Engine room.

985
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,761
Follow me!

986
01:46:37,646 --> 01:46:41,378
<i>T minus four minutes and counting,</i>

987
01:47:25,624 --> 01:47:28,389
Well done.
Officer watch, increase max.

988
01:47:28,561 --> 01:47:29,789
Keep firing!

989
01:47:32,097 --> 01:47:33,587
All hands, abandon ship.

990
01:47:33,999 --> 01:47:35,331
Abandon ship.

991
01:47:36,068 --> 01:47:38,968
<i>Abandon ship, Abandon ship,</i>

992
01:47:59,624 --> 01:48:02,990
Mr. Stamper,
what are you doing about the girl?

993
01:48:03,493 --> 01:48:06,518
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

994
01:48:09,532 --> 01:48:13,490
<i>T minus three minutes and counting,</i>

995
01:49:06,253 --> 01:49:09,050
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.

996
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:12,521
It's a bad habit of yours.

997
01:49:12,726 --> 01:49:14,454
There's nothing you can do.

998
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:26,366
<i>T minus two minutes and counting,</i>

999
01:49:26,571 --> 01:49:28,595
The missile's fully programmed.

1000
01:49:28,772 --> 01:49:30,798
It can't be stopped.

1001
01:49:31,042 --> 01:49:33,033
In minutes my plan will succeed.

1002
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:37,038
And thanks largely to your efforts...

1003
01:49:37,248 --> 01:49:39,546
...the British Navy
will destroy the evidence...

1004
01:49:39,718 --> 01:49:42,913
...and I'll be out of here
in a Carver news helicopter...

1005
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:44,609
...covering the event.

1006
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:47,949
It's going to be a fantastic show.

1007
01:49:48,124 --> 01:49:50,991
I may have some breaking news
for you, Elliot.

1008
01:49:56,199 --> 01:50:00,295
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot:

1009
01:50:03,139 --> 01:50:05,004
Give the people what they want.

1010
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:22,514
<i>T minus one minute and counting,</i>

1011
01:50:36,836 --> 01:50:38,463
Drop it, Mr. Bond...

1012
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:40,138
...or I drop your friend.

1013
01:50:42,142 --> 01:50:43,541
It's over, Stamper.

1014
01:50:44,144 --> 01:50:45,270
Let her go.

1015
01:50:45,478 --> 01:50:46,945
Not between you and me.

1016
01:50:49,114 --> 01:50:52,551
James, try the detonators.
The missile will set them off.

1017
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:55,780
Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.

1018
01:51:10,668 --> 01:51:13,637
<i>T minus 40 seconds,</i>

1019
01:51:20,144 --> 01:51:21,634
For Carver!

1020
01:51:25,182 --> 01:51:26,410
And Kaufman!

1021
01:51:36,693 --> 01:51:39,321
I owe you an unpleasant death,
Mr. Bond.

1022
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,902
<i>T minus 20 seconds,</i>

1023
01:52:29,276 --> 01:52:31,573
We die together, Mr. Bond.

1024
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:48,257
<i>T minus 10 seconds,</i>

1025
01:53:09,246 --> 01:53:10,645

1027
01:54:07,167 --> 01:54:09,795
<i>M, Bedford reports
Carver went down with the ship.</i>

1028
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:11,835
Seems that Bond made it.

1029
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:16,005
Moneypenny, take this release.

1030
01:54:16,176 --> 01:54:18,542
Elliot Carver is missing,
presumed drowned...

1031
01:54:18,712 --> 01:54:23,876
...while on a cruise aboard his
luxury yacht in the South China Sea.

1032
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:27,416
At present
the local authorities believe...

1033
01:54:27,585 --> 01:54:30,020
...the media mogul
committed suicide.

1034
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:41,995
<i>Commander Bond,,,</i>

1037
01:54:49,172 --> 01:54:51,003
<i>Are you there?</i>

1038
01:54:53,610 --> 01:54:56,078
They're looking for us, James.

1039
01:54:58,115 --> 01:55:00,276
Let's stay undercover.
