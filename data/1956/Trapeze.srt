1
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,598
Ladies and gentlemen - Mike Ribble, the
only man alive today to attempt a triple.

2
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,713
Three complete somersaults before
reaching the arms of his catcher.

3
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,074
<i>Halt! Halt!</i>

4
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,672
You see, Achille, here I am 46 years old,
and suddenly I start to grow.

5
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,679
Before, the lowest bar on the lion's cage
was two inches above my head.

6
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,951
- Now it is only one.
- Maybe they shifted the bar.

7
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,436
- You know a fella named Mike Ribble?
- No.

8
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,037
<i>- Ce n'est pas si mal que ça, monsieur.
- Ou sont les gueules?</i>

9
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,116
<i>- Vous voulez des tigres?
- Et mon nom?</i>

10
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,037
"Monsieur Bouglione".

11
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,153
<i>Chaque année, il est de plus en plus
minuscule. Refaites-moi cette affiche.</i>

12
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,594
Monsieur Bouglione, you like? Beautiful,
yes? By opening night, magnificent. I...

13
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,679
- What they do, I see. What do you do?
- Me? I show you.

14
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,556
Hey-hup!

15
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,516
Hey-hup!

16
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,755
Hup!

17
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,836
Alley-oop!

18
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,750
<i>- Parlez Anglais?
- Yeah.</i>

19
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,519
- Do you know Mike Ribble?
- Never heard of him.

20
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,553
Want a snake act? Three of the sweetest
performers that ever circled a torso.

21
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,195
- He's got the build for it, hasn't he?
- He don't look like a snake lover.

22
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,118
- Anybody know Mike Ribble?
- Say hello to the gentleman.

23
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,754
American. A great flier.
You know, the trapeze.

24
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,269
- He's got a job here.
- I knew a man named Gribble.

25
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,076
Did an act with a python of uncertain
temper and extraordinary big jaws.

26
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,395
- Who are you?
- Tino Orsini.

27
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,909
- Guido Orsini your father?
- Yeah.

28
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,157
- Cheap due to unforeseen circumstances.
- That's Ribble.

29
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,555
Above the plane, tightening the rigging.

30
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,674
Baby, wake up. She's a bit sluggish
since her dinner last week.

31
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
Mr Ribble! Say, Mr Ribble!

32
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,268
You! In my circus, when I
put together a show I have silence.

33
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,358
- I just wanna see Mr Ribble.
- See him on his time, not mine.

34
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,358
- Monsieur, you said you'd find a buyer.
- I find no buyer.

35
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,472
Everybody knows
the snake killed your brother.

36
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,071
She's high-spirited, that's all. If she's
warm it's safe. My brother let her get cold.

37
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,715
If you did not already have a snake act,
would you buy a snake act?

38
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,197
Now watch. Off the bars,
a double forward twist.

39
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,149
- We do business, monsieur?
- I see these boys work before.

40
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,874
- Where'd they find you?
- They're lucky, no?

41
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,276
- Where you find her?
- We don't find her. She finds us.

42
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,355
Well?

43
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,756
I pay you what you got before,
and I check what you got before.

44
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,031
But the Cirque d'Hiver
is more important than where we were.

45
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,594
The Cirque d'Hiver, yes. Your act, no.

46
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,632
- Look, I take the act as it is.
- All right.

47
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,716
Same pay.

48
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,678
Ah...

49
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,279
- He likes us?
- What did he say?

50
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,516
Come on, say it.

51
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,279
- What's the matter, Lola?
- Whatever he said, say it.

52
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,391
Come on. Speak, Lola.

53
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,839
- Bouglione...
- Yeah?

54
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,758
- He will not buy the act as it is.
- Why?

55
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,158
- He wants me to do more.
- More for you? Already there is too much!

56
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,796
I do not say it's my idea that I do more.
It's Bouglione. He insist.

57
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,195
Otherwise, we don't work.

58
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,118
You're always trying
to do more. It's our act.

59
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,519
Ali, if you feel this way about me,
I will leave the act.

60
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,638
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>

61
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,111
Mr Ribble? Hey, Mr Ribble?

62
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,836
Hey, get down out of there
before you fall down.

63
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,872
- But I'm a flier.
- I don't care what you are. Get down.

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,438
I came all the way from Brooklyn
to see you. My old man is Guido Orsini.

65
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,793
That buzzard still flyin'?

66
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,390
He taught me all he knew. You're
the only man who can teach me more.

67
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,911
Tell him I'm not a coach. I'm a rigger.
And tell him in person, back in Brooklyn.

68
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,999
- Look, Mr Ribble...
- Go on, beat it, son. I'm busy.

69
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,157
I want something only you can give me.

70
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,675
You're the only man in the world
that can teach me the triple.

71
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,194
The triple? Are you crazy?
Don't you know why I'm a rigger?

72
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,471
I throw a double somersault.
I need a little help on the third.

73
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,229
- Just a little help on the third, huh?
- I know it's not easy...

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,797
You come out of that third somersault like
an express train. And you come out blind.

75
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,278
A split second to reach for your catcher,
and a split second for him to grab you.

76
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,550
- That's all there is to it.
- All I want...

77
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,036
How many wet-eared kids have
come to me tryin' to suck me back in?

78
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,435
But you top 'em all. You wanna do a triple.

79
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,439
All I ask is one look. If you don't think
I got it, I'll go back to Brooklyn.

80
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,313
Well, start packin'.

81
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,196
How am I doing?

82
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,392
How about this?

83
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,910
You tryin' to leave your fingerprints
on the bar? Grip it lightly.

84
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,318
Get your hands closer together.
They're too far apart.

85
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,472
Closer still. Shoulder width.

86
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,037
When you do a roll over the bar that way,
shoot way up in the air.

87
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,949
You know, I modelled
my style after yours.

88
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,232
Then you'll always be a second-rater.
Make your own style.

89
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,749
You don't force out high enough.

90
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,035
You'll never reach your catcher unless
you kick for the ceiling. Watch my swing.

91
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,798
There. This is where your catcher
would be for any big trick.

92
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,876
Here I come. Catch me!

93
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,639
- You fool! Without a net?
- Who needs a net?

94
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,230
- I should have dropped you on your head.
- But you didn't.

95
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,158
You! I told you before, get down.

96
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,953
A dead flier becomes a live catcher.

97
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,477
You've got great hands.
Be a catcher. Catch me.

98
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,034
I'm no catcher,
not for you or anybody else.

99
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,754
Come back in the business.
We'll make a team.

100
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,758
The only act to do a triple -
Ribble and Orsini.

101
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,035
You want my advice? Well, here it is. Fly
back to Brooklyn while you can still fly.

102
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,193
From flier to rigger in one accident.
New York to Paris. He's fallen a long way.

103
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,790
- He's not smashed up as bad as I heard.
- It's his heart that's smashed.

104
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,992
He used to be a flier.
Now he can't even get on the pedestal.

105
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,715
What good is life to a bird if he can't fly?
You can understand.

106
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,877
Sure I can. Mr Bouglione?
How'd you like my act?

107
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,718
- What act?
- Ribble and Orsini.

108
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,072
You come here, do two flips on the bar,
make one pass, right away you got an act.

109
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,478
Congratulations. One of you runs
before he can walk, the other a cripple.

110
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,832
Ribble wants to work with me. Are you
interested or do I go somewhere else?

111
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm interested, but I know this man better
than you do. Remember, I warned you.

112
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,633
- You still here? Up all night, huh?
- Look, Mr Ribble...

113
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,799
That's why there are
no more performers. Nobody trains.

114
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,193
That's the lousiest full twist...

115
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,155
Look what you did.

116
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,918
Mr Ribble?

117
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,190
How about this?

118
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,112
It's not like workin' with my own bars,
but tell me what you think anyway.

119
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,318
Hands close enough together, Mr Ribble?

120
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,399
What do you think, Mr Ribble?

121
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,312
- How's that, Mr Ribble?
- Lousy.

122
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,992
Mike?

123
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,191
- Who is it?
- Mike, it is Rosa.

124
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,639
Rosa!

125
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,672
Where'd you come from?
I thought you were in Australia.

126
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,758
And Africa. Three years. I am back, Mike.

127
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,792
We are opening here.
What are you doing now?

128
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,753
<i>- Come here, let's have a look at you.
- Rosa!</i>

129
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,839
- You want my horses to catch a cold?
- Well, if it ain't old Chikki.

130
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,918
The horses first,
always the horses, eh, Chikki?

131
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,558
I thought you were dead. She's Mrs Chikki
Fauchon now. I married her last year.

132
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,672
Well, congratulations. You're a lucky man.

133
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,916
<i>You should know.</i>

134
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,998
Rosa, come on. Come on, Rosa!

135
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,990
Lady? Oh, lady, excuse me.

136
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,590
Would you do me a favour? Can I talk
to you? You seem to know Mr Ribble...

137
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,711
Hey, rigger, come here.
We want to talk to you.

138
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,276
- Have a drink?
- What? Yeah, sure. Bottle of beer.

139
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,915
We make some changes in the act.
The rigging will have to be different.

140
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,318
We need a third bar and another set
of wires eight feet from the centre bar.

141
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,079
I want the apron
extended another four feet.

142
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,636
And the platform
should be dropped six inches.

143
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,311
Of course, the tension will have to be
checked for my takeoff.

144
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,359
I'd like it to be ready first thing
in the morning, so if you'll get to it...

145
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,471
- Did you hear what I said?
- Sure.

146
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,832
You said the spotlight will be on you
when you do a flyaway at the finish.

147
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,509
Oh, shut up. Shut up!

148
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,794
- Is there something better to put it on?
- That depends. What are you selling?

149
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,712
- Hey, there's a picture of you.
- Don't just stand there. Order something.

150
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,637
- Beer.
- Make it two.

151
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,394
Clark, Segrist, Concello,
Codona, Amadori and... and Ribble.

152
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,069
The only six men in the world
that ever threw a triple.

153
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,909
There'll never be a seventh. When
circus was real, flying was a religion.

154
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,990
Now what have you got? Pink lights,
ballet girls, blue sawdust. A lot of hoopla.

155
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,997
You'll never throw a triple. You know
why? Because you drink too much.

156
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,908
...so after I got 'em, I thought about
the snakeskin-shoe business.

157
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,192
But how many pairs of shoes
can you get from a trio of pythons?

158
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,559
- Are you happy with Chikki?
- I'm not unhappy. Eat the soup.

159
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,595
- Stop mothering me.
- Why? Isn't that what all loves come to?

160
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,599
Mike, why don't you shave
at least every other day?

161
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,238
Shave, eat... I'm getting
a regular life since you came back.

162
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,749
That boy. Is he trapeze?

163
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,189
He wants to be a flier.

164
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,470
Has he talent?

165
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,233
Could be great. Just great.

166
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,634
You know, Mike, I often wondered
why you never became a catcher.

167
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,159
When did you start wondering?
About three minutes ago?

168
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,555
You got to learn to tumble,
my boy. Like me.

169
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,238
Mike, you like that boy. Team up with him.
Catch him. Nobody can do it better.

170
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,592
Before he becomes this great catcher
he might change the rigging for my act.

171
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,750
- Don't let your partners hear it's your act.
- You said he could be great.

172
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,839
He could be the seventh man
in the world to do a triple.

173
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,713
Oh, Mike, Mike...

174
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,513
You spent years on the triple.
Look what it did to you!

175
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,633
Now you can have a good flying act
without it. Don't let the triple kill it.

176
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,354
- It's in him. Why shouldn't he do it?
- For what?

177
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,471
To pull a shoulder? Break his back?

178
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,149
I'll show him what I did wrong.
We'll be the greatest in the business.

179
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,556
- For how long?
- You want him to swing on a single bar?

180
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,312
Not with that kind of talent. I'd rather
see him cutting hair in a barber's shop.

181
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,190
Now, tomorrow we'll...

182
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,638
Now, tomorrow you'll get down to
business. You'll do no more drinkin'.

183
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,228
Watch. The man that photographed
my fall was your best friend.

184
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,035
He can keep you
from making the same mistake.

185
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,869
I'm breaking from the bar too late.
First somersault OK. Second OK.

186
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,753
Third somersault - short.

187
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,551
That's the boner that cost me the triple.
Not big, but fatal.

188
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,832
So we'll start at the beginning and make
each move perfect before we try the next.

189
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,439
I'll run it again for you.

190
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,114
Take a natural set now. That's it.
Hold it, hold it. Break! Break full!

191
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,358
Keep your head up. Don't bend those legs.
What are they made of, rubber?

192
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,917
That's it. Down the hill.
Right, back up. Now hold it. Now break!

193
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,669
Go.

194
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,997
Hold it. Hold it.
Now take a natural set. Natural.

195
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,315
Good. Great!

196
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,874
No!

197
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,276
No, no, no! Too late. Too late.

198
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,350
You'll bust your neck. It always happens
when you break too late. Let's try it again.

199
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,356
Hit it.

200
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,717
You got to learn to miss a trick
as well as catch it.

201
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,675
Landing in the net that way, you'll break
your neck just as easy as hitting the floor.

202
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,234
Now you watch that.

203
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,669
Bring those knees up more.
Hug your chest.

204
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,352
When you do a triple you gotta be
a tight little ball. Let's do it again.

205
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,634
That's better.

206
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,194
You're late again. If you can't make
those easy ones, we'll never get to a triple.

207
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,076
Mike?

208
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,792
Hit it!

209
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,594
Next time you try a double,
get that time right.

210
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,157
The clock inside you always knows what
time it is. Keep it tickin' alongside mine.

211
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,159
We'll never get a triple until we
keep the same time. Let's try it again.

212
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,239
Have the confidence that I'll be there
to take you. Here's what you're doin'.

213
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,512
You got your legs here. Here's your body.
That's the position you come in to me in.

214
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,838
When I take you by the legs, fine, but you
get that whip in the end and I lose you.

215
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,397
Now, if you come in to me like this, we get
that beautiful smooth rideaway. Got it?

216
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,229
The double cutaway to the stick,
that's a different story entirely.

217
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,799
Good, good, good!
You're beginning to look like a flier.

218
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,758
- How about the triple?
- I'll tell you when you're ready.

219
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,678
- Monsieur Bouglione!
- You're in, Mike. I buy this act!

220
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,438
- Monsieur?
- Yes?

221
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,269
Everybody wants me to do more
in the act, so I must have a new costume.

222
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,879
- Do you like it?
- Uh-huh.

223
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,754
I'm glad you like it. My partners
will need a little advance to pay for it.

224
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,474
I have to sell tickets, not buy costumes.

225
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,910
Costumes sell tickets, don't they?
Costumes like this?

226
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,669
That we'll never know.
The bill is already full. Your act is out.

227
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,396
- We're out? But we had an agreement.
- Perhaps you'd like to show it to me?

228
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,035
<i>Ingrato mascalzone!
Non te la caverai, sai?</i>

229
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,038
<i>lo ti faccio causa, capito? Disgraziato!</i>

230
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,869
<i>Non sei degno di avere un'artista
come me. Vigliacco, brutto mascalzone!</i>

231
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,037
Don't shout. Ask yourself
which is the better act.

232
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,436
Trapeze is always good business.

233
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,715
Chikki, where are the flames? I was
promised I would have fire on that hoop.

234
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,070
- It will take time.
- "Time"?

235
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,078
Is opening night next year?
I want flames now.

236
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,476
Last year it was jumping through knives.
Now you want fire.

237
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,637
You must go back to Mike.
I will kill Chikki for you.

238
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,437
Mr Bouglione, you will have the act I
promised. If I say flames, it will be flames.

239
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,074
Even if I was crazy enough,
the horse is not.

240
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,317
That's your affair.
I am offered flames, I expect flames.

241
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,716
<i>Rosa,
you are not watching the horse.</i>

242
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,796
Now, gently.

243
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,233
<i>- Late time.
- I got off late?</i>

244
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,715
Too late off the board.

245
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,755
- How was the kip?
- You're kipping too early.

246
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,757
I had a bad grip on the bar.

247
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,316
- Monsieur Bouglione?
- Eh? What? Yes?

248
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,433
I apologise, monsieur.
You are right. It is a skilful act.

249
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,516
<i>Don't put your head down.</i>

250
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,438
But is skill enough?
Can the people appreciate it?

251
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,790
<i>- Kip still wrong?
- You're too late.</i>

252
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,753
People like spangles,
you know, monsieur?

253
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,474
- They are good for the imagination.
- You think about this act?

254
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,752
- You already have an act.
- Not at the Cirque d'Hiver.

255
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,111
What about your partners?
Don't you mind losing them?

256
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,959
Let them show me the agreement,
monsieur.

257
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,198
No. Mike Ribble always has a two act.
A two act is what he wants. Nothing else.

258
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,791
And you, monsieur. Do you care
what the act is so long as they look?

259
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,152
That act might be great.
But the great ones are not easy to keep.

260
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,510
<i>- How was my head?
- Keep your head up.</i>

261
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,794
- They are always moving on.
- With you in it, I could keep this act, eh?

262
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,515
If I were a part of it,
I would be very loyal to you, monsieur.

263
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,589
If you can become part of it, I would
appreciate your loyalty, mademoiselle.

264
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,952
<i>- Was I slow on the break?
- You broke too late.</i>

265
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,593
- What did he say to the costume?
- New ones for all of us?

266
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,076
He never looked at it.
He's dropping our act. We are fired.

267
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,679
- Fired?
- It can't be.

268
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,509
- The bill is full. We are out.
- Where is Bouglione? He can't do this.

269
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,394
- I talked to him. It's a waste of breath.
- Then what do we do?

270
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,149
I was thinking, if we act quick
we might get a booking in Marseille.

271
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,831
- It's her fault. Wanting more in the act.
- Lola's right. Marseille is our best bet.

272
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,996
I wanted to go there in the first place.

273
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,079
Maybe it would be better if you
went ahead, then I could join you.

274
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,317
In case we don't get a booking,
it would save money.

275
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,955
We have no time to waste here.
Let's get the rigging together.

276
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,036
<i>Ciao.</i>

277
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,680
How are the hands?

278
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,994
Hot.

279
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,271
Throw me a triple and we'll call it quits.

280
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,510
- You mean it?
- There's always gotta be a first time.

281
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,676
OK, you're the boss.

282
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,999
Heads up down there.
Clear the ring for a minute. Heads up.

283
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,557
Now remember, don't fight that bar.

284
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,990
Your natural break will give you
all the height you need.

285
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,159
<i>- The beautiful women love brave boys.
- Ta gueule!</i>

286
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,430
And the great Chikki.

287
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,278
<i>Tu peux pas faire attention,
espèce d'imbécile?</i>

288
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,356
Right.

289
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,592
<i>Hup!</i>

290
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,798
- What's he up to?
- They're trying for a triple.

291
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,956
Hup!

292
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,311
- What happened?
- I dunno, I... I froze.

293
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,592
You can't quit now, man.
Swallow the lump and let's go.

294
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,233
- Mike? You all right?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

295
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,194
You almost had it, kid.
You almost made it. Your first triple.

296
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,276
Yeah, but what was wrong?

297
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,437
You broke too soon.
That's why you barrelled into me.

298
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,676
But the triple itself was perfect.

299
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,792
That one moment up there,
I knew what you were talkin' about.

300
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,639
Now you know why I've been
drivin' you so hard, huh?

301
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,638
We're gonna give 'em that triple
on opening night.

302
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,069
- Wanna try it again?
- No, no.

303
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,115
Tomorrow, the next day, you can do all
you want. But now let's take the night off.

304
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,233
It's the young Orsini all right.
And the great old Ribble.

305
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,150
Give him a rubdown, Max. And remember
you're workin' on pure gold. Alley-oop!

306
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,989
Come, Tino.
We put a good shine on the gold.

307
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,350
The boy's good, huh?

308
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,836
At least it's good to see you smile again.

309
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,878
- How do you like my costume?
- That's an awful lot of spangles.

310
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,993
It's for opening night.
I wanted to make sure it wouldn't split.

311
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,757
It would be terrible if something happened
in front of all those people.

312
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,037
It's a good idea to try it out on a fast spin.
If it'll stand that, it'll stand anything.

313
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,676
Take a deep breath. Give it all you got.

314
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,356
- The costume will split!
- Let me worry about the costume.

315
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,636
- Sure wouldn't worry about that costume.
- My style is OK?

316
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,593
On a rope there's nothing I can teach you.

317
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,358
I want to learn all I can.

318
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,793
Maybe we should... talk about it.

319
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,830
Give me time to get out of this.

320
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,476
- Asleep?
- Shh.

321
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,870
- Paul, a small bottle of brandy.
- Brandy?

322
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,355
And a couple of cups.

323
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,836
- 400 francs.
- Shh. I'll pay you tomorrow.

324
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,997
- Maybe I'm dead tomorrow.
- I'll put the money in your coffin.

325
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,192
I was dreaming I had a box
at the Folies Bergère.

326
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,949
There were all these beautiful girls,
and one kept looking at me.

327
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,756
A little blonde with blue eyes? Take no
notice. I know her. She's not sympathetic.

328
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,758
Go on back to sleep
and dream about the triple.

329
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
- Where you going?
- Around.

330
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,313
- Wait, I'll come with you.
- Stay there. You need rest.

331
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,989
- I feel great.
- I know how you feel better than you do.

332
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,758
I'll see you around.

333
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,111
Go back to sleep.
Your little blonde has a friend waiting.

334
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,834
She'll probably look like Mike.

335
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,676
Come in.

336
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,630
Whatever kept you?

337
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,553
I hear the boy was very good today.

338
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,399
Good? He was great.
He missed the triple by an inch.

339
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,796
You should congratulate him.
You'll find him in the menagerie.

340
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,230
Let's drink to Ribble and Orsini,
the first pure act in years.

341
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,638
Let's hope the public like it.
They never asked for purity before.

342
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,197
- It's so long since they saw it, they forgot.
- No, Mike. Things have changed.

343
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,189
Why stick to a two act? People want light,
sparkle, something pleasing to the eye.

344
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,029
A bit of feminine beauty like Lola here.

345
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,869
Think it over, Mike,
while I go congratulate your boy.

346
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,917
I have great hopes for this act.

347
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,475
I watched you work.

348
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,672
Bouglione's wrong. Your way is right.

349
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,031
- He knows box office.
- That's all he knows.

350
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,870
That's all he cares.
The work itself he thinks nothing of.

351
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,198
- That bothers you?
- Why not? He throws out my partners.

352
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,709
- They are not bad workers.
- They're good.

353
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,391
All right. But they are not
in the same class as you.

354
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,196
- I've got a great flier.
- Always the flier gets credit.

355
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,709
What he does makes a flash.

356
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,877
Your partner is nothing without you.

357
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,788
My partners,
they can find work without me.

358
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,311
But your Tino, he had to come
halfway round the world to find you.

359
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,318
Does Bouglione appreciate it?

360
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,716
- He sure appreciates you.
- Oh, me.

361
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,038
He wants me to be like a bit
of window-dressing in some other act.

362
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,230
You don't like that?

363
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,433
All my life I wanted
to get better and better.

364
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,915
To be the best of all.

365
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,156
Like you.

366
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,071
Our act's pretty dangerous.

367
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,320
I don't care how dangerous,
so long as I am with the best.

368
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,795
With you, for example.

369
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,432
- You think we could work well together?
- I know we could.

370
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,077
- Can you stand heights?
- The higher the better.

371
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,794
- How are your wrists?
- Strong enough.

372
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,751
Legs?

373
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,712
I was always strong in the legs.

374
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,350
- How about your hocks?
- What?

375
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,436
Here.

376
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,516
Fine.

377
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,393
You'll really fly high?

378
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,796
Because I'm not afraid of anything.

379
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,112
But I am afraid.
That's why I'm stickin' to a two act.

380
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,829
<i>Ma chi ti credi di essere! Ma chi ti cerca!</i>

381
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,988
<i>Egoista che non sei altro! Nemmeno se mi
dai un milione ci vengo nel numero tuo!</i>

382
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:38,629
<i>Brutto pallone gonfiato. Ti credi un artista,
ti credi. Lo sai cosa sei? Un pagliaccio!</i>

383
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,599
Good morning, uncle.
What makes you so tall?

384
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,114
Max, what are you doin'?
Keepin' banking hours?

385
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,198
My alarm clock was late going off.

386
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,359
You like that, don't you, baby?
She's a proper woman.

387
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,713
Hey, take it easy.

388
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,958
- You had a good time last night, eh?
- You know everything, don't you?

389
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,390
Brandy, two cups. You drink by yourself?

390
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,715
- You feel good, eh?
- I feel great.

391
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,718
- Who are you trying to fool?
- Otto!

392
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,559
I know you. You used to be
a catcher for Mike.

393
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,752
Misser, you mean.
He couldn't catch a baby in a basket.

394
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,952
That night your timing was so bad
I needed arms ten feet long.

395
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,877
- You're so right.
- Mike...

396
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,595
This boy, Orsini. Hm? He's good?

397
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,633
- Too good for you. Go get your own flier.
- There are no fliers today.

398
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,469
- Harry, he needs an act. Sell him a snake.
- One? And break up the family?

399
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,513
Snakes are affectionate, especially
girl snakes. They all go together.

400
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,475
Look, Mike, I do you a favour. You can't
work with that leg for long, that I know.

401
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,639
So I catch him and I give you
a pension. How about it?

402
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,595
- Max, wanna fly to him?
- I'm too heavy. I'd break his arms.

403
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,757
- I stick around, Mike.
- Do that. I'll buy you a beer later.

404
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,075
Here, how about a snake act up in the air?

405
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,590
Clean and unusual family show.
Snakes are natural climbers.

406
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,157
When your snakes can fly
like this Tino, then I'm interested.

407
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,036
Hup. Hup.

408
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,474
<i>- Still worried about the height?
- Not when we're swinging together.</i>

409
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,550
- You'd be good if you wanted to be a flier.
- I'm glad I asked you to take me up.

410
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,629
Let the weight of your body carry you out.
Remember the trampoline. Same idea.

411
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,799
- The way you're catching on...
- Tino! What's she doing up there?

412
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,151
She's all right, Mike.
Watch her. She's good.

413
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,759
Get her down.

414
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,316
Don't get excited, Mike.
I just happened to run into her.

415
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,398
There's no room for more than two
up there. Now get her down.

416
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,399
Take it easy, Mike.
The girl looks good, eh?

417
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,273
- Great, but not in my act.
- Let her do a simple trick.

418
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,359
- Just drop the bar. What harm?
- Plenty. She'll ruin the act. Tino...

419
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,916
I give you my word,
the act will be improved.

420
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,830
Improved? By a dame? I'm tryin'
to give you a pure trapeze act...

421
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,078
I know your act, its purity, its perfection.
I also know what the public wants.

422
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,397
- Money, money, always the money!
- You can eat for nothing?

423
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,751
- What's Bouglione getting excited about?
- Don't argue over me.

424
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,317
- Oh, no. I'll just go down...
- Tino, I hate quarrels. Stay, please.

425
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,319
It's unique in history, the greatest act
since Léotard invented trapeze

426
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,115
in this circus 100 years ago. And
you talk about box office and spangles.

427
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,710
I buy the acts here, Mike.
I throw out what I don't like.

428
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,752
We haven't got time.
We'd lose the triple opening night!

429
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,395
I buy the acts here.
That's all I want. No arguments.

430
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,717
You think they'll pay more
to see her than to see a triple?

431
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,469
I fill my circus in my way
or I empty it in my way.

432
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,433
In my circus there's room
for only my way.

433
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,112
Either the three of you are up there
opening night, or you're not there at all.

434
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,435
I don't understand.

435
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,916
You're in the act. You're part of the act.

436
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,075
You wanna be in the act?
Come on over to me.

437
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,590
- Fly?!
- Just a simple straight jump.

438
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,395
I'll call your time from the board
and call you off the bar.

439
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,988
It's too soon. I can't.

440
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,272
Don't worry. He'll catch you.
He's got great hands.

441
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,998
Here.

442
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,671
Use the bar, it'll give you
a better swing. Come on.

443
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,756
Now don't worry.

444
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,076
Hup!

445
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,949
Higher. Get higher. All of it.

446
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,433
Come on.

447
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,878
Hep!

448
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,234
I did it! You caught me!

449
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,634
Let's try it again.
This time get it up higher. All of it.

450
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:02,399
Mike, I wanna talk to you. Mike, you gotta
listen to me. We were just horsing around.

451
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,956
- How did she get up there?
- I didn't mean to give Bouglione ideas.

452
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,152
She had the ideas. Now we've lost
the triple opening night.

453
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,192
Mike, you don't know her.
She's had a rough life.

454
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,677
Listen, you idiot. She gave me the
treatment before she got around to you.

455
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,950
Why do you think
I always wanted a two act?

456
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,200
Because one flies and one catches,
and no one comes between.

457
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,393
Nobody's gonna come between.

458
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,356
- Is he still angry?
- Are you worried?

459
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,314
I was thinking of his hands.
They give you so much confidence.

460
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,954
Looks like you've had
enough of that already.

461
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,435
Now you are angry too. Why?

462
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,835
Why didn't you say
you already spoke to Mike?

463
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,556
I? He must have misunderstood.
It was Bouglione who was talking.

464
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,750
Look.

465
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,078
I came over here to learn the triple.
And I'm gonna learn it.

466
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,478
- And you think I'd interfere with that?
- Mike thinks so.

467
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,549
We gotta think alike. Neither one of us
is good without the other.

468
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,516
I knew nothing about these things, or
I'd never have let Bouglione persuade me.

469
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,791
I'm frightened I will not be good for you.

470
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,354
I'm frightened I will hurt the act.

471
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,119
Goodbye, Tino.

472
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,958
Lola...

473
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,993
Tomorrow I should leave. My only chance
for an engagement is in Marseille.

474
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,917
- With your old act?
- Of course.

475
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,431
My partners have
great plans for me. It is just...

476
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,317
I would rather have been a tiny part of a
great act than the star of an ordinary one.

477
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,238
- Please, Tino, we don't talk about it...
- Oh, Lola.

478
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,113
Lola, stay. Don't go.

479
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,992
When he was swinging me, he made
me feel I could do anything up there.

480
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,953
You'll have to be happy
with a couple of simple tricks.

481
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,036
How could I ever dream of more?

482
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,756
Want me to tell you your fortune?
Only 100 francs for young lovers...

483
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,317
Shall we? I wonder if
she sees me with you on opening night.

484
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,036
<i>Digli che saremo felici, eh?</i>

485
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,197
- What is this we hear about Lola?
- Can't you see I'm busy?

486
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,550
Don't bother me. It's not my business.

487
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,433
Good house tonight, Mr Bouglione.

488
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,951
Ah, Mr Ringling North.
How can New York spare you so often?

489
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,231
Doesn't it worry you
to have others run your big circus?

490
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,319
Always looking for something good.
Takes a lot of acts to fill my three rings.

491
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,718
- Takes a lot of looking to find the best.
- I'm afraid we can't surprise you.

492
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,072
- I heard Mike Ribble has an act again.
- Ordinary, very ordinary.

493
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,556
He must have found a good flier
to tempt Mike out of the rafters.

494
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,309
An eager boy but without experience.
You wouldn't be interested.

495
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,991
If the new act's as classic as the old,
I'll be very interested.

496
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,559
- Mr Bouglione...
- Don't bother me. Talk to her.

497
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,636
<i>Yeah.</i>

498
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,679
I feel as young as my first opening night.
I have the same ball in my stomach.

499
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,916
- The hoop?
- Why do I hate fire so much?

500
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,998
You go so fast, you never feel it.
It only looks dangerous.

501
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,076
Lola, look what I got for you.

502
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,589
- It's pretty.
- My father wears one like it.

503
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,838
He always says "Fear no trick,
for we are in strong hands."

504
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,077
- It's for luck.
- Thank you.

505
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,272
You will need it, Lola. For all your tricks.

506
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,995
<i>Rosa, allez, dépêche-toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu attends?</i>

507
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,076
<i>Allez, ouvrez.</i>

508
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,749
You promised to join us
when we got a booking.

509
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,235
- We have one in Marseille.
- I'm happy for you.

510
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,352
- The booking is for the act. All four.
- Get someone else.

511
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,597
<i>Impossible.</i>

512
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,830
Get out. I said get out.

513
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,873
She will leave you too. She will
spit on you just like she spit on us.

514
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,150
The costume's split.

515
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,438
Mike...

516
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,994
you didn't do that for the act.

517
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,640
I can remember when
those boys had a good act.

518
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,548
- Quiet, with no screaming, no fighting.
- Mike...

519
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,629
Then you came. The routines and quality
went, but the spotlight stayed on you.

520
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,150
Why must you hate me?
Why always hate?

521
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,559
When this engagement ends, you're out.
Tino and me work alone, as we planned.

522
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,073
With that stick you walk, but with Tino you
fly. You think you can live through Tino?

523
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,829
<i>- Ask Tino who makes him live.
- No more tricks, Lola. You're out.</i>

524
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,193
I could mean more to Tino than you.
I can take him whenever I want.

525
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,675
That trick I've still got.

526
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,552
For your own sake, Lola, get out.

527
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,240
Or one night these hands
won't be there to catch you.

528
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,558
<i>Allez-y doucement, bon Dieu!
Dégagez le passage, espèce d'idiot.</i>

529
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,955
<i>Appelez-moi le vétérinaire
immédiatement.</i>

530
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,833
- What happened?
- The flames. The horse shied.

531
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,397
<i>Pepe! Bobo! Max! In the ring!
Make plenty of noise! Allez!</i>

532
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,433
All right. We follow with the bears. Why
aren't the bears ready? Forget the bears.

533
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,630
- Mike, your act goes on next.
- Tino. Lola.

534
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:10,676
Put out that net for the flying act. Get this
horse out. Girls, don't stand there! Places!

535
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,678
<i>Avance, Lucien.
Foutez-moi le camp de là-dedans!</i>

536
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,631
- What happened?
- All that hurry, I slipped on the stairs.

537
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,955
- Let me look.
- It's nothing. It's nothing!

538
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,594
Why are you getting so excited?
You must do...

539
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,676
<i>Tino.</i>

540
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,510
You did that. You killed him.

541
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,791
Chikki, it was the flames. I told you before.

542
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,754
Why should I waste my talent,
my horse and my life on such a woman?

543
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,518
Why should you?

544
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,791
I leave. Right now, I leave.

545
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,074
How many more years you gonna
keep on watching him, Otto?

546
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,228
Not much longer.
The boy flies in like a cannonball.

547
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,430
He needs two good legs.

548
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,472
Ready?

549
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,831
Hear them? That's for you.

550
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,315
- Shall I go again?
- You know Mike.

551
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,398
Better stick to what we rehearsed.

552
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,915
- Nice style, the boy.
- Not bad.

553
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,716
The last time I saw Mike work was the
night he fell. Good to see him back again.

554
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,994
Gee, Mike, that was great.
Just like old times.

555
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,996
Hey, that ain't in the act.

556
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,429
- You shouldn't have done that.
- It was worth it. Listen to them.

557
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,873
Just one photograph, please.

558
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,876
Quite still.

559
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,109
Is this how you spell Orsini?

560
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,075
Tomorrow we sign a contract.
All three. I count on your loyalty.

561
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,639
Hey, Mr North. Look here, remember me?

562
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,349
Sure I remember you.
Madison Square Garden.

563
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,711
America has everything so big,
you must be short of dwarfs.

564
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,876
Dwarf acts are well liked in America.

565
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,434
Times change,
but you're a born professional.

566
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,676
- That's what I like.
- Certainly.

567
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,712
Professionals can always come back,
like Mike Ribble.

568
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,195
Mr John! I was hoping
you'd be here tonight.

569
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,709
Well, you look in good shape, boy.

570
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,912
Fine, fine. Tell me,
how did you like the boy?

571
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,476
I was watching the girl after I found out
I wasn't gonna see a triple.

572
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,955
You would have if the act
wasn't overcrowded.

573
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,356
Knowing you, Mike,
how did she ever get there?

574
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,076
Tino! Come here. I want you
to meet someone. Mr John Ringling North.

575
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,757
- A pleasure, Mr North.
- Hello, Tino.

576
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,839
- Mike says you've got a triple in you.
- We'd like to show it to you.

577
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,635
Show me in the next three weeks,
and I'll take it to New York.

578
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,470
Ribble and Orsini. I've kept that contract
on ice a long time for you, Mike.

579
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,114
<i>Hello, Monsieur North.
Comment allez-vous?</i>

580
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,708
I didn't hear my name mentioned.

581
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,234
Can you do a triple?

582
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,316
Can you?

583
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,311
Tino, the parade's starting!

584
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,115
- I'll be right back. Lola...
- Oh, don't touch me now. Don't touch me!

585
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,358
I'll talk to Mike. I'm sure we can
work out something. Lola, please...

586
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,029
Go with Mike to New York.
That's what you want.

587
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,157
- Lola...
- Parade!

588
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,112
Lola...

589
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,036
I'll talk to Mike.

590
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,119
It doesn't matter what anyone says
to Mike. Can't you see?

591
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,515
He's jealous.

592
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,393
He knows I... I love you.

593
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,154
The fortune-teller was right.

594
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,272
Lola...

595
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,796
Oh, Tino.

596
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,229
He saw it from the start.

597
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:38,354
Right from the start he saw
he might lose the only life he has.

598
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,153
The life you give him.

599
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,831
It frightens me to think
what he could do to us, Tino.

600
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,235
You are the flier.

601
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,316
You make the act.

602
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,795
You must make the decisions.

603
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,276
- Goodbye, Mr John.
- Parade!

604
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,756
- Where's Tino?
- I don't know. I didn't see him.

605
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,716
Tino! Tino!

606
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,915
Where is that boy?

607
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,793
Tino! Tino!

608
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,958
Tino!

609
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,957
Tino! Lola!

610
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,350
Tino! Lola!

611
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,474
Ribble! Get your chariot out of the way.

612
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,596
Take it out of the parade, Mike. When you
get your act together, join in at the rear.

613
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,154
Everybody in position!

614
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,430
Hurry up. Hurry up.

615
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,516
Back. Back.

616
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,833
<i>Two by two. Right and left.</i>

617
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,072
All the acts together, right and left.

618
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,038
Try 'em anytime.
Take 'em home for the weekend.

619
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,515
<i>I think you should.</i>

620
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,074
I'm sorry about the horse, Rosa.

621
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,591
- Mike is trying to sell me on the snakes.
- She'd be great with a snake act.

622
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,632
What about our act? Why are you
so anxious to get rid of Lola?

623
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,719
- It's easy to get rid of Lola.
- Look, Mike...

624
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,871
- I've decided...
- Ribble and Orsini.

625
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,956
- We teamed up right here.
- What...

626
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:45,029
Or Orsini and Ribble. However you put it,
it's the same. Till she came along.

627
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,628
- She didn't change anything for me.
- You?

628
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,435
She's not interested in you, me
or the act. Just Lola, that's all.

629
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,836
The more you give, the more she'll want.
She's ruined acts before.

630
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,999
- You can't even begin to see her clearly!
- I can see you, though.

631
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,271
I see you forgetting to check the rigging,
missing parades.

632
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,678
Next, you'll duck practice. You'll think
of her in the middle of a triple and lose it.

633
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,031
I think about her all the time.
Just like I think about the triple.

634
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,438
Tino, listen to me. You're
the only man living who can get the triple.

635
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,872
But her, Tino. Anybody can get her. Can't
you understand? Anybody can get her!

636
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,956
Shut up!

637
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,629
I'll work with you, Mike. I'll work
for the triple until my hands burn off.

638
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,320
But you force me to choose
and I'll leave you.

639
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,750
I want Lola most of all, because I love her.

640
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,713
And she loves me.

641
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,513
Mike, you can't keep that boy
locked to the trapeze.

642
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,915
Let him dream a little.

643
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,590
- There goes the triple.
- He'll come back to it.

644
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,712
- Give him time.
- It's too late. You heard him.

645
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,876
Oh, how blind can you be?

646
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,436
It is not Tino she wants to fly to. It is you.

647
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,112
- What did you say?
- It is not Tino she loves.

648
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,390
It is you.

649
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,511
How do you know?

650
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,679
Mike, haven't I been
through the whole trick myself?

651
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,756
Shouldn't I know?

652
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,199
- I hope you're right, Rosa.
- I know I'm right.

653
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,074
Because if you are,
you've just given me the triple.

654
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,477
- Three eight.
- I checked it.

655
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,797
My passport says three foot
seven and a half. Now three eight?

656
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,037
Maybe the tape is short.
Bouglione saves money on everything.

657
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,711
I can't understand it. None of my family
is over three foot six. It embarrassed me.

658
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:30,595
- Now three foot eight?
- Bend at the knees. No one will know.

659
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,111
- Good morning.
- Mademoiselle.

660
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,949
For five days a contract has been on
my desk. Nobody comes to sign it. Why?

661
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,469
You should speak to Mike Ribble.

662
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,239
You suppose I did not see him
with Ringling North?

663
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,158
Then speak to Tino.
I am very unimportant.

664
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,432
Do not play games with me. I put you in
the act. I count on you to keep it for me.

665
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,314
I owe you nothing. Someday I send you
a postcard from New York.

666
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,352
Mike takes you to New York?
You have a lot to learn about him.

667
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,871
So? I think he has already learned much
about me, and now we get on very well.

668
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,757
For an ambitious girl you surprise me.
Tino is the act. Tino is your meal ticket.

669
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,633
Without Tino you have nothing.

670
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,069
Remember that.

671
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,555
I will not forget, monsieur.

672
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,110
Otto, I think maybe
you'd better catch the boy.

673
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,597
Mike and I, we are friends.
I wait until his leg drops off.

674
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,351
- Had enough, Mike?
- North's due any day, Tino.

675
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,429
We've got to show him that triple.
Now, let's give it another try.

676
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,477
Tino, has Mike said
any more about New York?

677
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,433
No, but he said he's got
a new trick for you.

678
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,313
Are you gonna show me a triple or not?

679
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,715
Sorry, Mike. Next swing.

680
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,036
Your timing's way off.
Your mind's not on your work.

681
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:11,757
Take the day off. Figure out what you
did wrong. Tomorrow we make it perfect.

682
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,634
Come on, we'll work on a new trick.

683
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,230
- What we try?
- A pirouette back to the bar.

684
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,920
You are joking.
I am not ready for a pirouette.

685
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,558
Why not? You wanna be a flier, don't you?
A bird's nest across and a pirouette back.

686
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,716
All right.

687
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,193
<i>Hup!</i>

688
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,878
Mike, be fair. Let them alone.

689
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,558
- You brought it up.
- Mike...

690
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,636
Mind your business.

691
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,190
All night long, you hardly talked.
Is something wrong?

692
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,440
There's nothing wrong. I talked.
We talked a lot about the act.

693
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,519
When we're together,
I want to talk about you.

694
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,794
Oh, Lola, I don't wanna t...

695
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,756
It's getting late.

696
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,839
It's so good to be alone with you.
Just the two of us.

697
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,593
Three shows today,
three shows tomorrow. I am tired.

698
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,314
You must be tired too.

699
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,396
We work hard.

700
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,157
- Suddenly you're so tired.
- Oh, don't be angry, Tino.

701
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,556
Let things happen in their own time.

702
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,991
When could there be a better time?
Lola, we're in love with each other.

703
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,634
Oh, not now, Tino. Please.

704
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,115
Please, you must let me go.

705
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,116
Good night now.
Let me kiss you good night.

706
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,196
Lola...

707
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,993
you did mean everything you said?

708
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,435
Didn't you?

709
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,869
You haven't changed?

710
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,150
I haven't changed.

711
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,268
This is over before it begins.

712
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,789
You didn't come down here to tell me that.

713
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,878
We see each other on the bars.
Nowhere else.

714
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,949
- Is that what you want?
- You want a triple. I know what I want.

715
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,434
You don't love Tino. You never did.

716
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,155
- Suppose I tell him that.
- He would never believe you.

717
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,397
He'd believe you. Why don't you tell him?

718
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,432
I like working in the act.

719
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,553
Sooner or later he has to know.
Tell him before he finds out.

720
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,678
Have you ever worked
in an Italian carnival?

721
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,633
Two cars and a tent with holes in it.

722
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:04,357
Where sometimes you eat, but not if it
rains or a tyre blows out or the lion dies.

723
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,235
Where you are never paid, because
if you had bus fare you might leave.

724
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,476
All my life...

725
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,754
You think I don't remember it? You think
I am fool enough to take chances now?

726
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,155
Tell him.

727
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,556
Stop. I want you to stop.

728
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,240
Tell him. You've got to tell him.

729
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,394
This has to finish. It has to.

730
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,835
I don't want to love you.

731
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,595
You must let it finish.

732
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,711
I can't.

733
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,513
Please. Let it all finish now.

734
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,357
You know it can't finish like this.

735
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:57,392
You're wise to remember that
it is the flier who's important.

736
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,751
"Wise". Always I've had to be wise.

737
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,553
You're not pleased with my offer?

738
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:08,117
When you can give me Madison
Square Garden, then I'll be pleased.

739
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,995
Meanwhile I'll accept
because our act cannot go on as it is.

740
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,872
There are personal reasons.

741
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,234
Perfect. A split second sooner and you'd
have a triple. We'll give it to them tonight.

742
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,670
I have seen the personal reasons.

743
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:33,238
- It is not good that it happened this way.
- You want the boy, Otto. Don't complain.

744
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,599
You're sure that Tino
will break with Ribble?

745
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,076
Tino chose me before. He will again.

746
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,509
Chikki, you're back. Is that the new horse?

747
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,598
Just arrived. Got a surprise for Rosa.

748
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,679
Beautiful. Perfect. I wouldn't part
with them if I wasn't allergic to snakes.

749
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,190
- What about me?
- If you don't come out in spots in a day,

750
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,835
you've got a lovely new act.
Gotta hand it to Mike, it was a great idea.

751
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,155
I bring you a magnificent horse.

752
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,115
He feels nothing. Not knives, not flames,
nothing. And I find you with snakes.

753
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,550
Always you want me to do more.
Now a new horse to break my back.

754
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,069
- I stay with the snakes.
- You don't fool me.

755
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:20,593
You stay with Mike Ribble. Where is he?
When I was away you went back to him!

756
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,233
- Where's Tino?
- You decided to tell him about last night?

757
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,035
I just made my decision. I leave the act.

758
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,072
What are you gonna do?
Go back to your old act?

759
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,317
No. To my new one, with Tino.

760
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,909
- Lola.
- You make a fool of me with my wife.

761
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,235
You can't do that. Nobody can do it.

762
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,716
- What did you say?
- You hear me?

763
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,230
Where's my cane?

764
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,640
Get the first-aid box. Quick.

765
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,431
I will make up my own mind about the act.

766
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,917
Mr Bouglione, you speak to her. I can
do nothing. She refuses to work with me.

767
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,871
That's right, order me to do it.

768
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,675
You turn lions loose, you ruin my
reputation, then ask me for favours.

769
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,519
Escaped lions give him pleasure.
He loves danger.

770
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,916
He enjoys bending iron bars
with his beautiful body.

771
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,350
Mr Bouglione, you sent for me.
Was Mike badly hurt? Is he all right?

772
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,679
A scratch, nothing more. In your act,
nobody is necessary except the flier.

773
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:35,830
It's your signature I want on the contract.
You lose nothing if you get rid of Ribble.

774
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,032
- Get rid of Mike?
- You and she are a beautiful act.

775
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,438
You need nobody else.
Didn't Lola tell you our plan?

776
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:49,157
Mike looks after business.
You talk to Mike about your plans.

777
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:54,195
Mike is too busy to speak. Your other,
beautiful partner is with him.

778
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,515
- Leave him to her.
- Lola's with him?

779
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,200
Sure she's with him.

780
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,915
She can handle him.
She can handle all of us.

781
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,593
Uh...

782
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,430
- Where are they?
- First you worry for Mike, now for Lola.

783
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,551
Don't worry.

784
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,990
- What have I got to be worried about?
- Exactly.

785
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,076
Let us be discreet and forget them.

786
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,590
You'd say anything to make me sign.
Even put me against Mike.

787
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,633
My dear young man,
if I wished to put you against Mike

788
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,150
I would tell you,
follow the old woman with his cane.

789
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,318
But I don't. I say let us be discreet,

790
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,998
and businesslike.

791
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,117
I understand. You wish to leave
all your business to Mike, eh?

792
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,196
Well, please yourself.

793
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,474
I'm sure he's looking after it very well.
Very well indeed.

794
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,999
Pierre, leave word with Mike Ribble
I'll be here tonight.

795
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,198
<i>Allez, ma jolie, un kilo de mes carottes.
De la carotte, bien fraîche.</i>

796
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,515
<i>Approchez! Voyez nos belles poires.</i>

797
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:29,872
<i>Belles, juteuses, à emporter,
tout de suite, allez.</i>

798
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,231
<i>Elle est belle, elle est belle, ma tomate.</i>

799
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:39,310
<i>Les bananes. 100 francs le kilo
de bananes. Achetez mes belles bananes.</i>

800
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,150
<i>Voyez les beaux melons de Cavaillon,
mesdames. Beaux melons de Cavaillon.</i>

801
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,431
<i>Achetez un kilo de pêches,
100 francs le kilo.</i>

802
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,596
<i>Entrez.</i>

803
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,875
<i>Alors, vous I'avez trouvée cette canne?
II vous attend là-haut.</i>

804
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,595
<i>Hé bien, qu'est-ce qu'on vous sert?</i>

805
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,439
<i>Monsieur? Qu'est-ce qu'on vous sert?</i>

806
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,516
A beer.

807
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,869
We must tell Tino.

808
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,355
Not yet. Not yet.

809
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,439
We must. You know we must.
You said we must.

810
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,636
Last night.

811
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,276
How do I explain last night?

812
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,631
What are you trying to tell me?

813
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,910
I thought we met, but we hadn't.

814
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,600
I thought I knew you,
but I didn't know you.

815
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,030
I'm trying to tell you that...

816
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,197
I'm trying to tell you how much I love you.

817
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,756
I want you to know, in this one moment,
if only for this one moment,

818
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,509
that for the first time
in a long time, I feel alive.

819
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,596
Oh, Mike.

820
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:13,275
Tino will forgive you. Maybe he'll never
forgive me, but in time he will you.

821
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,871
Not now, he wouldn't.

822
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,594
Maybe once, but not now.

823
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,676
<i>Elle est belle, eh? C'est moi.</i>

824
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,758
<i>Ne soyez pas triste, c'est pas si important.</i>

825
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,120
<i>L'addition, s'il vous plaît.</i>

826
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,236
Hello, Mike.

827
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,315
You know this place?

828
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,398
It's got a machine I've never beaten.

829
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:30,278
- How's the arm?
- It's OK, it's OK.

830
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,757
Did you have somebody
to look after it for you?

831
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,314
Make that one behind the gate,
and you got it.

832
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,878
Toughest ones are always behind the
gate. You gotta be cagey to make 'em.

833
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,592
Tilt it a little, maybe it'll...

834
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,473
Yeah, you can cheat it.

835
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,715
Then you lose the game.

836
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:09,870
- Let's shove off. I'll get my jacket.
- Let me see if I can win... before we go.

837
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,351
You can't beat it, kid.

838
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,558
You had to prove it, didn't you?

839
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,035
You just had to win.

840
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:40,234
I'm sorry it happened this way.
I wanted to tell you...

841
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,840
We meant to tell you, but...

842
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,757
All right, tell me.
Go ahead and tell me. Tell me what?

843
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,156
- Not now, Tino.
- Then let me tell you what he said.

844
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,909
"Tino" he said. "You're the only man
in the world that can get a triple."

845
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,874
"But her? Anybody can get her."
That's what he said.

846
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,549
- No, it's not true, Tino.
- Go ahead, deny it!

847
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,309
He never wanted you in the act. He swore
he'd get you out any way he could.

848
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,830
Even if he had to take you away from me.

849
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,396
- What's he trying to say, Mike?
- Tell her!

850
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,636
Tell her! Don't you want her to hear it?

851
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,035
- You shouted it loud enough.
- Not now, Tino.

852
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,630
I'm up to here with your words about
a two act, a triple and its purity.

853
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,593
I'm chokin' at the way you
made her look lousy in my eyes.

854
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,790
But you said it could be done, didn't you?

855
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,799
Tell her the price you put on her. Tell her
how you said anybody could have her.

856
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,514
- Anybody, because she was a cheap...
- Lola...

857
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,596
I love you.

858
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,795
Tino...

859
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,469
You know why I don't kill you?
Because I wanna see you a rigger again.

860
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,309
I want you watching me up there
with Otto. I've forgotten you, rigger.

861
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,874
Try to forget me!

862
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,757
Chikki and Rosa on yet?

863
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,668
Ah, Monsieur North.
We're always pleased to see you.

864
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,633
You need not have brought a pen.
The boy will be mine.

865
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,752
- You'll see no triple tonight.
- You've signed him?

866
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,714
I sent Otto, not Mike, up there tonight.
Tino will sign with me.

867
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,628
You had a good dinner? I don't want
your evening to be a complete failure.

868
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:35,515
Most kind of you, but an evening
in Paris is always a pleasure.

869
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,116
- You said he was not coming.
- Don't worry, I'll handle him.

870
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,595
You go in and change.

871
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,556
The boy wants Otto, he's got Otto. You're
through, you're finished. Understand?

872
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,955
You can't do that. Mr North is coming.

873
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,871
<i>What are you doing here while the show
is on? Get back to the stables. Vite.</i>

874
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,437
I can remember when you were interested
only in circus. Think back, Bouglione.

875
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,597
Give me this night. Just this one night.

876
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,271
I warned you before. I'm only interested
in the public, not in Ringling North.

877
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,755
Now get out of those skins.

878
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,159
That's the way we'll keep it
for tonight. I'll tell her.

879
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:32,151
After tonight, make your own plans.
We keep the routine simple.

880
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,840
You do the somersault
and we do the passing trick.

881
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,191
He's coming, Tino. Ringling North.
You've got to work with me...

882
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,630
- I'll go check the rigging.
- Tino...

883
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,591
I did this to him.

884
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,553
We did. You and I.

885
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,959
But it's not Tino you think of now,
it's yourself.

886
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:00,072
You'd like to make up for the time you fell.

887
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,317
You don't care who you hurt,
who you destroy,

888
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,635
as long as you make that good at last.

889
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,509
That was true once, but not after today.

890
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,116
Maybe I was in love with you
all the time and never knew it.

891
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,595
But suddenly I knew it.

892
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,713
- And it was too late.
- Oh, please. I listened to you before.

893
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,030
Forget me, but not Tino.

894
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:32,109
Speak to Bouglione. Get him to talk to
the boy. He'll do it for you, you know that.

895
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,749
I know you promised me love,
and gave me a twisted moment.

896
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,952
You promised Tino greatness
and gave him empty words.

897
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,390
So leave me alone, and leave Tino to Otto.

898
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,071
- We can't. Not like this. For Tino...
- Let Otto catch him.

899
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:59,079
I told you. A magnificent horse.
What a judge I am.

900
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,237
Yes, Chikki.
You know everything about horses.

901
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,033
Otto will never give you that triple.
You've got to give yourself this chance.

902
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,309
Get off that bar.

903
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,910
Ribble and Orsini. Remember, Tino?

904
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,395
Please, Tino. Let's go down.

905
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,080
Get off that bar before I knock you off.

906
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,033
All right. Try and do it.

907
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,116
You asked for it.

908
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,870
John Ringling North's down there.

909
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,711
Let's show him some real circus.
Let's give him a triple. Come on.

910
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,954
You're not giving up, are you? I thought
you had nerve. What's happened to it?

911
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,594
- Stop, Tino. He's not sane.
- Shut up.

912
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,112
You.

913
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,994
Stop that act. Turn off the spotlight.
Take down the net.

914
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,953
Quick, quick!
Take it down, take it down!

915
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,392
No net, Tino. But that should be
right down your alley.

916
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,355
When you first came to me there was no
net. That's when I first figured you had it.

917
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,436
Ballet!

918
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,592
Quick. Ballet! Ballet!

919
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,676
<i>Vite.</i>

920
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,075
This is the night we've been working for.

921
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,589
Your night. The biggest night of your life.

922
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,952
- You have to get them down! You must!
- They won't fly without a net.

923
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,993
<i>I guess I had you all wrong.
I guess you're only brave on the ground.</i>

924
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,636
We can go down, or stay up here and see
how much nerve you've really got.

925
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,514
Are you scared, Tino?
Are your hands wet? Are they sweating?

926
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:48,156
Maybe you're too scared to go down.
Does the height bother you? Is that it?

927
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,636
You said I was the only man in the world
could teach you a triple.

928
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:56,231
Well, there's nothing more I can give you.
It's up to you now.

929
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,633
Come on, kid. Get up.
Pull yourself together. Give it a try.

930
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,433
Take the rosin.

931
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:09,314
That's it, that's it.
Get plenty on those wrists.

932
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,793
Make sure you force out
above those connecting wires.

933
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:38,639
Take a natural set. When you ride
down the hill, break full and strong.

934
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,149
Watch my swing.
Let me know when it's right.

935
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,113
And remember, kid, you can do it.

936
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,389
Mr Ribble, can I get you
to hold it right there?

937
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,229
You boys made the circus circus
for me tonight. Get a picture of 'em.

938
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,828
<i>How about a smile?</i>

939
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,679
- Get some pictures.
- OK.

940
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,873
Can I take one smiling?
Hands up high. How about a smile?

941
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:25,589
<i>How about a smile?</i>

942
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,472
How about it? Make a smile.

943
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,673
I can't get over it, seeing a triple again.
How about it, Mike?

944
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,552
Tino made it easy for me.

945
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:37,036
How's it feel, boy, throwing your first one?

946
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:43,076
It feels like you should go on
throwing them, to a great catcher.

947
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,954
When you can fly like Tino,
anybody can catch you.

948
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:50,550
You fly in my circus, you fly with a net.
No nonsense like tonight.

949
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:55,276
- Now one of the three hands together.
- That's right. You two. You too, Miss Lola.

950
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,870
Mademoiselle, how do you feel
about going to America?

951
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,074
You're all having dinner with me. And the
way I feel, anything you want, name it.

952
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,718
I just wanna keep the act together.

953
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,230
- That's what I want.
- That's how it'll be.

954
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:16,113
How about one of the boy
and the girl together?

955
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,959
What's the secret of the triple, Mr Orsini?

956
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:23,198
Knowing when to come out of that third
somersault. Your timing's gotta be perfect.

957
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,949
It's like a little clock inside of you
that's got the right time.

958
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:31,198
It's gotta tick alongside your partner's.
You only get a triple when it's the same.

959
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:34,790
- When did you first know you had it?
- Mike knew before I did.

960
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,310
- I didn't think I was ready, but he did.
- Were you scared?

961
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:42,194
If not for Mike, I'd have quit.
The first time I did it, I froze.

962
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,834
- But he made me try again.
- And he caught that one?

963
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,112
Not quite. But suddenly I knew when I did
I'd have the world in the palm of my hand.

964
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:54,598
That's the kind of feeling it gives you.
There's nothing else like it...

965
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:12,598
When you get to New York, Otto,

966
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,518
don't push him too fast.

967
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,632
Let him feel it out.

968
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:24,073
And remember he's lofty, so don't
stay back in the hole. Swing up to him.

969
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,760
Don't ever try to snatch him,
cos he'll overturn.

970
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,110
The act is still yours, Mike.

971
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,515
Still Ribble and Orsini.

972
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,748
There's too much between us, Otto.

973
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,193
Keep him breaking full and strong.

974
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,391
Make him drive that break, drive it hard.

975
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,556
Now that he's got it, don't let him lose it.

976
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:23,593
