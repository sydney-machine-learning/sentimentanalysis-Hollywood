1
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,437
Mommy's going to the
beauty parlor, darling.

2
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,054
But I'm leaving you
with your favorite friend, Roger.

3
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,807
He is going to take
very, very good care of you.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,728
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab!

5
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,189
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,901
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.

7
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,363
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,615
Or my own sister.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,660
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin

10
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,787
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,791
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

12
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:28,504
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times
removed from my mother's side.

13
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,923
Or like my 27th cousin,
who is 37 times...

14
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,884
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.

15
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:41,392
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!

16
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:55,198
I'll save you, Baby!

17
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,366
Cookie.

18
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,369
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman.

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,634
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.

20
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,178
Don't they pay their electricity?

21
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,181
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?

22
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,975
- Where are you?
- Cookie.

23
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
Where'd you go?

24
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,604
What's that smoke?

25
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,603
Cookie.

26
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,027
Cookie.

27
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,410
I'm here, Baby...

28
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,975
Cookie.

29
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,827
Cookie.

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,335
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.

31
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,339
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

32
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,424
What the hell
was wrong with that take?

33
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,635
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.

34
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,440
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!

35
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,350
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?

36
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,062
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read
the script. Look what it says!

37
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,147
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked,
rabbit sees stars."

38
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,609
Not birds, stars!

39
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,444
Can we lose the playback, please?

40
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,196
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!

41
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,697
For cryin' out loud, Roger!

42
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,367
How many times do we have to
do this damn scene?

43
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,578
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!

44
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,205
Excuse me, toots.

45
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,166
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.

46
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,336
Clean this set up! And get him out
of there, or seal him up in it!

47
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,630
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!

48
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,007
That's lunch. We're on a half.

49
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,467
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!

50
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,178
Just drop the refrigerator on my head
one more time!

51
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,472
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.

52
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,684
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.

53
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,019
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

54
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,731
I can give you stars. Look. Look!

55
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,609
Look!

56
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,654
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.

57
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,365
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.

58
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,700
Toons.

59
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,370
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!

60
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,290
Come on, Raoul!

61
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,627
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...

62
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,338
He'll be right with you.

63
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,476
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.

64
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,854
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R. K.

65
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,234
How much do you know
about show business, Mr. Valiant?

66
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,362
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

67
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,198
Yeah, and there's no business
more expensive.

68
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,535
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

69
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,037
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.

70
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,830
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?

71
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,291
One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,375
Nah, he's a Toon.

73
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,378
You can drop anything you want
on his head. He'll shake it off.

74
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,715
But break his heart, he goes to pieces,
just like you or me.

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,966
Read that.

76
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,222
"Seen cooing over calamari
with not-so-new sugar daddy,"

77
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,185
"was Jessica Rabbit,
wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."

78
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,811
What's this got to do with me?

79
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,938
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

80
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,899
Look, I don't have time for this.

81
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,569
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

82
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,238
I want you to follow her,

83
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,326
get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,579
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?

85
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,914
Every Joe loves Toontown.

86
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,625
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.

87
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,419
Fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown,

88
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,421
you don't have to go to Toontown.

89
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,508
Nobody said you had to
go to Toontown anyway.

90
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,594
Have a seat, Valiant.

91
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,680
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

92
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,976
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?

93
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,979
So what do you think, Valiant?

94
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,233
Well?

95
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,866
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.

96
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,992
A hundred bucks?

97
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,453
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.

98
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,457
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.

99
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,961
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.

100
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,462
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.

101
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,506
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,217
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!

103
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,553
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!

104
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,479
Come on!

105
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,528
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?

106
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,282
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.

107
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:16,162
I got him on loan from Disney,
him and half the cast of Fantasia.

108
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,748
The best part is

109
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,085
they work for peanuts.

110
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,679
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?

111
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,392
Let's call the other 50
a carrot to finish the job.

112
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,104
You've been hanging
around rabbits too long.

113
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,634
W-Whoop! Whoop!

114
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,802
W-w-

115
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,556
Oh, excuse me!

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,829
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,790
Get out of my way!

118
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,420
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?

119
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,592
Right here! Right here!

120
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,848
What do I look like, a bank?

121
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,776
Wait for me!

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,569
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!

123
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,656
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!

124
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,617
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?

125
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,161
We got the best public
transportation system in the world.

126
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,468
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!

127
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,320
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.

128
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,732
- You bet.
- Anytime.

129
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,925
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?

130
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,162
Okay. What you got for me?

131
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,413
The usual bills.

132
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,334
Hey, give back my ball!

133
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,090
Hello, fella.

134
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,390
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.

135
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,942
What's with Earl?

136
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,533
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.

137
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,702
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

138
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,954
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?

139
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,084
Yeah, and put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

140
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,297
Oh, well.

141
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:01,136
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning?

142
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,645
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know
what happens here on Friday?

143
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,107
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.

144
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,567
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

145
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,944
I'm gonna lose my job.

146
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,114
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.

147
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,449
50 bucks?

148
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,910
Where's the rest?

149
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,163
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

150
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,542
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.

151
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,586
Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

152
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,170
Oh, come on, Dolores.

153
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,506
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.

154
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,470
Any film in there?

155
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,974
Should be.

156
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,102
I haven't had that roll
developed since our trip to Catalina.

157
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,981
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.

158
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,484
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.

159
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,077
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.

160
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,413
R. K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?

161
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,623
Maroon Cartoons?

162
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,628
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?

163
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,215
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?

164
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,636
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.

165
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,223
So what happened?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

166
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,058
Cut it out, Angelo.

167
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,102
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.

168
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,896
You're working for Little Bo Peep.

169
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,024
She's lost her sheep and
you're gonna help her find them.

170
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,317
Hey?

171
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,198
Get this straight, meatball.

172
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,576
I don't work for Toons!

173
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,834
So what's his problem?

174
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,756
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?

175
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,760
Dropped a piano on his head.

176
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,650
Got the password?

177
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,652
Walt sent me.

178
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,211
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.

179
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,241
All right.

180
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,493
Hey, look at that!

181
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,913
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!

182
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,624
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

183
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,882
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.

184
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,972
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers,
but you are despicable.

185
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,266
Doggone stubborn nitwit!

186
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,101
That did it!

187
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,479
This is the last time I work with
someone with a speech impediment.

188
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,814
Oh, yeah?

189
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,193
This means war.

190
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,665
- What, you think that's funny?
- It's a panic.

191
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,543
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

192
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,881
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look,
the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.

193
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,549
No hard feelings, I hope.

194
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,052
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.

195
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,096
Marvin Acme, the guy that
owns Toontown. The gag king.

196
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,974
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.

197
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,142
Put it there, pal.

198
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,898
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.

199
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,281
Scotch on the rocks.

200
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,533
And I mean ice!

201
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,083
This is hot stuff!

202
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!

203
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,920
Great. Thanks.

204
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,886
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?

205
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,390
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?

206
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,600
Long time no see.

207
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,977
What are you doing here?

208
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,731
Work's been kinda slow
since cartoons went to color.

209
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,484
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!

210
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,988
Yeah, you still got it.

211
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,329
What's with him?

212
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,000
Mr. Acme never misses a night
when Jessica performs.

213
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,835
Got a thing for rabbits?

214
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,598
You had plenty money

215
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,182
In 1922

216
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,272
You let other women

217
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,776
Make a fool of you

218
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,404
Why don't you do right

219
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:42,370
Like some other men do?

220
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,338
Get out of here

221
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,547
Give me some money too

222
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,716
She's married to Roger Rabbit?

223
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,720
Yeah. What a lucky girl.

224
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,476
Now if you had prepared

225
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,730
20 years ago

226
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,275
You wouldn't be wanderin' now

227
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,820
From door to door

228
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,407
Why don't you do right

229
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:27,332
Like some other men do?

230
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,173
Get out of here

231
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:40,387
Give me some money too

232
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,729
Get out of here

233
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:54,776
Give me some money too

234
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:04,578
Why don't you do right

235
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,958
Like some other men

236
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,045
Do?

237
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,370
Who is it?

238
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,999
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

239
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,920
You sure murdered 'em
again tonight, baby.

240
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,798
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.

241
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:04,262
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.

242
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,848
You killed them. You slayed them.

243
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,268
You belted them into little pieces.

244
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,481
What do you think
you're doin', chump?

245
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,608
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

246
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,620
And don't let me catch your
peepin' face around here again!

247
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,081
Got it?

248
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,624
Ooga-booga!

249
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,646
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.

250
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,566
I got everything arranged,
right here on the bed.

251
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,153
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.

252
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,281
Oh, Jessica, you promised.

253
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,325
Oh, all right.

254
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,203
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.

255
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,332
Patty-cake.

256
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,210
Patty-cake.

257
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,171
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.

258
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,048
Patty-cake.

259
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,717
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.

260
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,720
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!

261
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,847
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

262
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,971
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

263
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,685
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

264
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,396
I don't believe it!

265
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,068
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

266
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,195
Is that true?

267
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,363
Take comfort, son.

268
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,241
You're not the first man whose wife
played patty-cake on him.

269
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,459
I just don't believe it.

270
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,754
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.

271
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,505
I shan't believe it.

272
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,257
Believe it, kid.

273
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,967
I took the pictures myself.

274
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,761
She played patty-cake.

275
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,514
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.

276
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,642
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!

277
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,312
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!

278
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,106
It's absolutely impossible!

279
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,108
Jessica's the light of my life,

280
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,445
the apple of my eye,
the cream in my coffee!

281
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,656
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.

282
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,535
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbor for 30 years.

283
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,537
Who would've thought
he was a sugar daddy?

284
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,207
Somebody must have
made her do it!

285
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,959
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

286
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,786
Thanks. I needed that.

287
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,333
Son of a bitch.

288
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,795
Look, Mr. Maroon.

289
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,590
I think my work here is finished.

290
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,955
How about that carrot
you owe me?

291
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,470
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.

292
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,764
Thanks.

293
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:40,395
Roger, I know all this
seems pretty painful now,

294
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,856
but you'll find someone new.

295
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,733
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.

296
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,319
Good-looking guy like that.

297
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,155
The dames will be
breaking his door down.

298
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,656
Dames? What dames?

299
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,991
Jessica is the only one for me!

300
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,660
You'll see! We'll rise above
this piddling peccadillo!

301
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,744
We're going to be happy again!

302
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,747
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...

303
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,132
Well, at least he took it well.

304
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,269
Oh, Jessica!

305
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,231
Please tell me it's not true.

306
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,112
P-p-please!

307
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,629
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.

308
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,425
Where'd you come from?

309
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:02,221
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

310
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,850
So I took a couple of
dirty pictures. So kill me.

311
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,227
I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you.

312
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,189
Marvin Acme.

313
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,858
The rabbit cacked him last night.

314
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,526
What?

315
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,622
Now what?

316
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,417
It's just I haven't been this close
to Toontown for a while.

317
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,460
Yeeow!

318
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,552
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!

319
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,971
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!

320
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,021
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.

321
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,899
I didn't see anything.

322
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,151
Maybe you heard a noise or something.

323
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,153
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.

324
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,115
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.

325
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,783
Are you sure you didn't see anything?

326
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,577
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.

327
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,746
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.

328
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:12,542
Just like a Toon to drop
a safe on a guy's head.

329
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,043
Sorry, Eddie.

330
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,754
You better wait here, all right?

331
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,423
You got a positive I. D.?

332
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,346
Must be.

333
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,727
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

334
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,647
You've seen one of these?

335
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,611
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

336
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,293
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?

337
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,171
Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

338
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,806
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.

339
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,893
Mr. Valiant?

340
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,690
I hope you're proud of yourself

341
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,650
and those pictures you took.

342
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,762
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!

343
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,747
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

344
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,208
Hey, Mike, come here!

345
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,089
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.

346
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,529
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

347
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,949
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for you.

348
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,076
Weren't you, Eddie?

349
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,162
- Hand it over.
- Sure.

350
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,125
His number-one seller.

351
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,339
I see working for a Toon
has rubbed off on you.

352
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,093
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R. K. Maroon.

353
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,428
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.

354
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,722
He told us the rabbit
became quite agitated

355
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,307
when you showed him the pictures.

356
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:37,770
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife were going to be happy.

357
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,313
Is that true?

358
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,732
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

359
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,068
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.

360
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,821
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,

361
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,198
I'd say it was the booze talking.

362
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,120
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.

363
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,748
Look out!

364
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,087
- Weasels?
- Yes.

365
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,256
I find they have
a special gift for the work.

366
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,426
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.

367
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,220
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.

368
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:14,640
We've got "deformants"
all over the city. We'll find him.

369
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,854
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?

370
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,817
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

371
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,695
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

372
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,281
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.

373
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,033
A human has been
murdered by a Toon.

374
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,493
Don't you appreciate
the magnitude of that?

375
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,210
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

376
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,964
my goal has been
to reign in the insanity.

377
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,260
And the only way to do that is
to make Toons respect the law.

378
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,693
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?

379
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,155
He spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple years back,

380
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,907
bought the election.

381
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,158
Yeah? What's that?

382
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,953
Remember how we always thought

383
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,497
there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?

384
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,332
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.

385
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,959
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.

386
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,838
- He calls it "the dip."
- I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.

387
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,716
Then I'll try him, convict him

388
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,219
and execute him.

389
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:53,864
That's one dead shoe, boss?

390
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,410
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.

391
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:01,539
But this is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

392
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,291
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

393
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,187
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

394
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,277
I've been tryin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me.

395
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,363
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.

396
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,115
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.

397
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,077
I wanna talk to you about
the Acme murder. Hey, doll.

398
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,288
Why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

399
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,875
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

400
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,169
The lady's man?

401
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,589
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
in a 3-year-old dinky.

402
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,132
Yeah, must be tough.

403
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,051
Look, Valiant,
the rabbit didn't kill Acme.

404
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,138
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.

405
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,683
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

406
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:06,187
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

407
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,940
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.

408
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,318
He promised to leave Toontown
to us Toons.

409
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,862
That will is the reason
he got bumped off.

410
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,447
Has anybody ever seen this will?

411
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,241
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.

412
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:24,288
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.

413
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,917
I just figured since you were the one
who got my pal in trouble,

414
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,169
you might want to help get him out.

415
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,837
I can pay you.

416
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,299
Save your money for a pair
of elevator shoes!

417
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,886
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!

418
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,987
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

419
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:04,078
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

420
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,892
Baby was right.

421
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,280
The hell with it.

422
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,521
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.

423
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,732
I thought it would be best
if I waited inside,

424
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,567
seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!

425
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,070
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could
get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

426
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,157
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

427
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,784
Nobody. Not a soul except...

428
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,954
- Who?
- Well, you see...

429
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,790
I didn't know where your office was,
so I asked the newsboy.

430
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,543
He didn't know, so I asked
the fireman, the green grocer,

431
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,712
the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.

432
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,631
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

433
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,175
In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!

434
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,135
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?

435
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,929
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!

436
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,263
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!

437
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,599
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?

438
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,061
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job.

439
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,730
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.

440
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,149
My whole purpose in life

441
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,527
is to make people

442
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,698
laugh!

443
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,201
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.

444
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,371
I got a little steamed when you
showed me those pictures of Jessica,

445
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,083
so I rushed over
to the Ink and Paint Club.

446
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:18,379
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
so I wrote her a love letter.

447
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,047
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

448
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:24,969
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

449
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:29,974
That's right. I know that she was
just an innocent victim of circumstance.

450
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,559
I suppose you used the old lipstick
on the mirror routine?

451
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,728
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.

452
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,606
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.

453
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:42,778
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."

454
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,782
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand..."

455
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,951
Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

456
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,663
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must...

457
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:57,084
be read in person,
so I went home to wait for her.

458
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,837
But the weasels were there,
waiting for me.

459
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,964
So... So I ran.

460
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:06,260
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

461
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,555
Yeah, and you're also the guy
that helped all these Toons.

462
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,182
Everybody knows,
when a Toon's in trouble,

463
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,519
there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.

464
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,354
Not anymore.

465
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,898
Get out of that chair!

466
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,447
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?

467
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,950
He looks like a sensitive
and sober fellow.

468
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:34,121
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.

469
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,707
I come here for help,
and what do you do?

470
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,294
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.

471
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,839
So long, and thanks for nothin'.

472
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,761
That's the closet! Stupe.

473
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:05,819
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

474
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,196
Get out!

475
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,034
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.

476
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,912
Yah!

477
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,754
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!

478
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:29,551
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!

479
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,932
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!

480
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,145
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!

481
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,357
Don't let 'em find me!

482
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,610
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.

483
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,947
Open up in the name of the law!

484
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,311
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.

485
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,826
You know there's no justice
for Toons anymore.

486
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,621
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?

487
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,792
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.

488
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,128
We just want the rabbit.

489
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,964
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?

490
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,174
What are we gonna do?

491
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,927
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

492
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,732
It looks like they gave us
the slip, boss?

493
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,027
Nah. Valiant's got him
stashed somewhere.

494
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,740
Hold it right there.

495
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,453
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.

496
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,208
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?

497
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,835
I haven't seen him.

498
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,714
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.

499
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,300
Sheesh, Valiant.

500
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,765
Search the place, boys.

501
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,476
And leave no stone unturned.

502
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,648
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here,

503
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,443
and it was "corrugated"
by several others.

504
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,654
So cut the "bullshtick."

505
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,284
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

506
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:36,963
Stop that laughin'!

507
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:41,600
You know what happens
when ya can't stop laughin'!

508
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,315
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

509
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,445
As for you, Valiant, step out of line,

510
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,406
and we'll hang you and your laundry

511
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,408
out to dry.

512
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,623
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."

513
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,671
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.

514
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:14,383
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?

515
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:20,931
Blecch! For starters,
don't ever kiss me again!

516
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:27,104
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.

517
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,067
Dolores. Dolores!

518
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,069
Dolores!

519
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,326
Hey, Eddie, you made
the front page today.

520
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:44,579
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.

521
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:48,542
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!

522
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,089
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket,

523
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,008
or are you just happy to see me?

524
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,220
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

525
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,682
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.

526
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,812
Jeepers, Eddie,
that almost killed me!

527
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,816
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

528
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,444
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.

529
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:19,072
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy,
a gin mill, a hooch parlor.

530
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,657
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!

531
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,035
It's a spy hole!

532
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,787
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!

533
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,667
- Crazy Toon.
- Watch your head!

534
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,838
I thought you said
you'd never take another Toon case.

535
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,424
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.

536
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,552
Somebody's made a patsy out of me,
and I'm going to find out why.

537
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,103
Hold still, will ya?

538
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,442
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.

539
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,697
You mean to tell me that

540
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,142
you could have taken your hand
out of that cuff at any time?

541
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,370
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.

542
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,788
Get out!

543
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,749
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

544
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,433
He always this funny, or only on days
when he's wanted for murder?

545
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,545
Listen, my philosophy is this.

546
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,799
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

547
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,594
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

548
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,263
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.

549
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:28,225
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.

550
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,394
And I think Maroon
played the part of sound mind

551
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,895
and your wife the sound body.

552
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,147
Why, I resent that innuendo!

553
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,025
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.

554
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:38,944
But how do you know?

555
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,613
Because they were still looking
for it after they killed him.

556
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,989
Anything I can do?

557
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,117
Maybe you can go downtown
and check the probate.

558
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,536
Yeah, check the probate!

559
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,914
Why, my Uncle Thumper
had a problem with his probate,

560
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:55,127
and he had to take these big pills
and drink lots of water.

561
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:59,756
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.

562
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,509
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon

563
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,137
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head

564
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,639
so that he could get
his hands on Toontown?

565
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,599
Yeah.

566
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,101
That's my hunch.

567
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,814
Can he stay here
for a couple of days?

568
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,192
He's not gonna do
anything crazy, is he?

569
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,826
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.

570
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,748
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?

571
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,799
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr. Valiant.

572
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,510
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

573
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:50,807
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.

574
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,726
Yeah, I bet you would.

575
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,438
You've gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

576
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:00,442
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

577
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,945
You don't know how hard it is
being a woman

578
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,031
looking the way I do.

579
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,908
Yeah, well.

580
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,578
You don't know how hard
it is being a man

581
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,831
looking at a woman,
looking the way you do.

582
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,460
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.

583
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,176
Weren't you the one I caught playing
patty-cake with old man Acme?

584
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,514
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

585
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:34,351
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

586
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,195
I didn't want to have anything
to do with it,

587
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,231
but he said if I didn't
pose for those patty-cake pictures,

588
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,858
Roger would never work
in this town again.

589
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,401
I couldn't let that happen.

590
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,113
I'd do anything
for my husband, Mr. Valiant.

591
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,867
- Anything.
- What a wife.

592
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:54,538
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

593
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,958
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

594
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,086
Well.

595
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,756
Sorry.

596
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,635
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.

597
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,096
Think about it.

598
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,273
Well!

599
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,652
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

600
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,238
Probably lookin' for
a good place to stick a knife.

601
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,241
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!

602
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,577
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...

603
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:38,873
Come on, Dolores.

604
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,459
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

605
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,464
She's just trying to get
her hands on the rabbit.

606
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,755
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

607
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,508
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

608
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:52,596
Look, I want you to go out, I want you
to buy yourself a new swim suit,

609
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,514
'cause you and me
are going to Catalina.

610
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,600
I'm on the verge
of wrappin' up this case.

611
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,101
No, you're not, Eddie.

612
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:02,105
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

613
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,191
Maroon's not after Toontown
like you thought.

614
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,153
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

615
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,946
They put in the highest bid.

616
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:13,116
And unless Mr. Acme's will
shows up by midnight tonight,

617
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,702
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

618
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,539
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.

619
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,877
First they buy the Red Car, then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

620
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,130
I don't get it.

621
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,757
Yes!

622
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,717
Roger!

623
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,723
The rabbit. Get the judge.

624
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,558
A joke don't sit there on your brain

625
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,310
Nice shirt.

626
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,730
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

627
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,816
My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see

628
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:50,153
But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be

629
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,322
C, D, E, F, G

630
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:56,660
H, I... I would love
to raise some Cain

631
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,663
Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight

632
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,665
And look, there is no pain

633
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,667
No pain. No pain. No pain

634
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,630
No pain. No pain. No...

635
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,593
- No!
- Hey, wait!

636
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,096
Yah!

637
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,641
Hey, who turned out the lights?

638
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,977
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?

639
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,646
You crazy rabbit!

640
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,607
I've been out there risking my neck
for you, and what are you doin'?

641
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,401
Singin' and dancin'!

642
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:35,031
But I'm a Toon. Toons
are supposed to make people laugh.

643
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,324
Sit down!

644
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,703
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

645
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,205
Yeah, and when they're done laughin',
they'll call the cops!

646
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,582
That guy Angelo would
rat on you for a nickel.

647
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,960
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.

648
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,045
Why? Because you made him laugh?

649
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,174
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

650
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,970
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

651
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,763
Laughter is the most...

652
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:02,308
"Ixnay." "Ix-nay."

653
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,484
I'm looking for a murderer.

654
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,540
A rabbit.

655
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,295
A Toon rabbit.

656
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,674
About yea big.

657
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:36,551
Look.

658
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,972
There's no rabbit here,
so don't harass my customers.

659
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:45,268
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

660
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,765
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

661
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,143
Where?

662
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,770
See?

663
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,488
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.

664
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,747
Say "hello," Harvey.

665
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,256
I told you so.

666
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:22,448
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.

667
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,537
Quite a loony selection
for a group of drunken reprobates.

668
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:35,962
He's here!

669
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,927
Stop that laughing!

670
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,268
Have you forgotten
what happened last time?

671
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,229
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna end up dead,

672
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,899
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

673
00:53:55,983 --> 00:54:00,111
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

674
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:05,992
No, Sergeant. Disassembling
the place won't be necessary.

675
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:10,288
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

676
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:19,464
No Toon can resist
the old Shave and a Haircut trick.

677
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,807
I don't know who's toonier,
you or Doom.

678
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,061
Roger!

679
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,607
Ro... Roger.

680
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,402
Roger, no!

681
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,491
Roger, don't...

682
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,080
Shave and a haircut

683
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,959
Two bits

684
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:05,051
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

685
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,970
We'll see to him later.

686
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:11,557
Right now I feel like
dispensing some justice.

687
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:13,768
Bring me some dip.

688
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,778
Does the condemned have anything to
say before his sentence is carried out?

689
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:27,573
Why, yeah. I...

690
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,913
Dolores, a bourbon,
and make it a double.

691
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,165
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.

692
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,126
Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!

693
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,919
Pour the drink, Dolores.

694
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,760
Hey, Judge!

695
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,139
Doesn't a dying rabbit
deserve a last request?

696
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,891
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.

697
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,436
I think you want a drink.

698
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,816
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.

699
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,194
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

700
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,279
Happy trails.

701
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,614
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.

702
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,700
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.

703
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,826
He doesn't want the drink.

704
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,286
- He does! You do!
- I don't!

705
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,662
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!

706
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,539
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!

707
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,500
- I do!
- You don't!

708
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,879
Listen, when I say "I do,"
that means I do!

709
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
Come on.

710
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,170
Gotcha, kid.

711
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,427
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!

712
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,805
Move it, pops! Yikes!

713
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,684
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,

714
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,978
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!

715
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,022
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!

716
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,107
Yah!

717
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,900
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?

718
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,026
There's no damn key!

719
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:30,113
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here,
will ya? Come on!

720
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,825
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?

721
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:38,538
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!

722
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:42,667
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!

723
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,800
That's better.

724
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,970
I can't believe they locked me up
for driving on the sidewalk.

725
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,139
Come on, Eddie. Get in!

726
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,891
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!

727
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,644
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!

728
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,314
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!

729
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,483
How about this weather?

730
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,820
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!

731
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,989
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!

732
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,324
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?

733
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,701
Are they bums, or what?

734
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,744
Move over. I'm drivin'!

735
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,499
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

736
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,043
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!

737
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,672
Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

738
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:35,344
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!

739
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,565
Benny,
there's cops right behind us!

740
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,401
Not for long, Roger.

741
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,446
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.

742
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,450
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.

743
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,452
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!

744
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,500
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!

745
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,211
What do you think I am? Benny!

746
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,421
No. No!

747
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,965
Pull the lever!

748
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,634
- Which one?
- Which one?

749
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,303
Which one?

750
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,763
I'm gonna ram 'em.

751
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,974
What the heck?

752
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,480
I'm gettin' too old for this!

753
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,405
Jumpin' jeepers!

754
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,908
Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

755
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,993
I don't know. A bridge!

756
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:47,583
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.

757
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,586
I got just the place. And incidentally,

758
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:54,006
if you should ever need a ride,
just stick out your thumb.

759
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,634
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

760
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,347
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?

761
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:20,116
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

762
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,703
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!

763
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,706
Ouch!

764
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,459
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

765
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,628
What's wrong with you?

766
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,464
You're the only person
in this theater that isn't laughing.

767
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:39,051
Is there nothing that can permeate
your impervious puss?

768
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:43,139
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.

769
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:48,185
What could've possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

770
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,439
You want to know? I'll tell you.

771
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,900
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.

772
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:58,696
That's right. A Toon.

773
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,325
We were investigating a robbery at
the First National Bank of Toontown.

774
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,287
Back in those days, me and Teddy
liked working Toontown.

775
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,247
We thought it was a lot of laughs.

776
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,251
Anyway, this guy

777
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,130
got away with a zillion simoleons.

778
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,094
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

779
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,097
We went in.

780
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,227
Only he got the drop on us, literally.

781
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,982
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.

782
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,985
Broke my arm.

783
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,113
Teddy never made it.

784
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,742
I never did find out who that guy was.

785
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,078
All I remember was,

786
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,914
he was standin' over me, laughin',

787
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:53,209
with those burnin' red eyes

788
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,503
and that high, squeaky voice.

789
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,383
He disappeared
into Toontown after that.

790
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:05,721
No wonder you hate me.

791
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,975
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!

792
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,187
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.

793
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,356
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

794
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,732
You do hate me.

795
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,444
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

796
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:23,406
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

797
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,117
All the times you yanked my ears?

798
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,663
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.

799
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,792
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!

800
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,669
I hope it's another cartoon!

801
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,548
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

802
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,008
I hate the news.

803
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,138
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.

804
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,307
It's all packed up in the car outside.

805
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,728
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

806
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:59,567
Yeah. I'm sorry about
the trouble in the bar.

807
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:04,196
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives
for a living wasn't for me anyway.

808
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,032
Dolores?

809
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:13,789
You oughta find yourself a good man.

810
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,752
But I already have a good man.

811
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,679
P-p-please, don't mind me.

812
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:33,305
You better get going, Eddie.

813
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:40,608
A near miss, but this
miss says that's as good as a smile.

814
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,360
California Cloverleaf...

815
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,571
Glad Teddy's not here
to see me running away

816
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,156
with my tail between my legs.

817
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,534
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

818
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,162
The Pacific Red Car trolley line

819
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,415
and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.

820
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,335
Here, R.K. Maroon is seen
clinching the deal

821
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,378
with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs

822
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:05,799
in one of the biggest real estate deals
ever in California history.

823
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,844
- That's it!
- Three-and-a-half million dollars...

824
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,095
That's the connection!

825
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,732
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.

826
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,611
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?

827
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,488
Don't be ridiculous.

828
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,785
When you called Maroon, you told him
you had the will, but you don't.

829
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,287
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

830
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,540
He might try to kill ya.

831
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,377
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.

832
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,212
Now, you cover my back.

833
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,049
And if you hear or see anything,
beep the horn twice.

834
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,553
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.

835
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:55,474
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

836
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,769
Why, nobody gets the drop
on Roger Rabbit.

837
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,751
What's up, Doc?

838
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,004
Valiant, what are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

839
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,381
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

840
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,842
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?

841
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,970
Sure. I got the will.

842
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,433
The question is, do you have the way?

843
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,102
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

844
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,105
You got a lot of brass
coming up here by yourself.

845
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,857
Who said I'm here by myself?

846
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,038
Let me see that will.

847
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,498
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!

848
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:10,299
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

849
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,344
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.

850
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,059
Get up! Come on.

851
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,227
What are you gonna
do to me, Valiant?

852
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:26,440
I'm gonna listen to you
spin the Cloverleaf scenario.

853
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,070
A story of greed, sex and murder.

854
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,740
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

855
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,951
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

856
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,913
Everybody's got to have a hobby.

857
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,583
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

858
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,087
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio,

859
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:51,298
but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold them his.

860
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,092
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

861
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,595
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

862
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,265
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!

863
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:04,436
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?

864
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,481
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.

865
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,110
Unless Acme's will shows
by midnight tonight,

866
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,446
Toontown's going to be
live for the free...

867
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,639
Roger!

868
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,041
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...

869
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,128
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!

870
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,964
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.

871
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,634
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.

872
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,514
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!

873
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,850
Let's go.

874
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:09,269
Yahoo!

875
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:11,123
Smile, darn ya, smile

876
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:16,420
You know, this old world
is a great world after all

877
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:20,340
Smile, darn ya, smile

878
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:25,387
And right away watch lady luck
pay you a call

879
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:30,225
Things are never black
as they are painted

880
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,437
Time for you and joy to get acquainted

881
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,771
Hi, Eddie!

882
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,650
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!

883
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,458
Tallyho! Tallyho!

884
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,094
Get out of here!

885
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,733
Going up, sir.

886
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,028
Yah!

887
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,239
Mind the step, sir.

888
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,743
Hold on, sir.

889
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,871
Yah!

890
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,212
Your floor, sir.

891
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,675
Have a good day, sir.

892
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,681
Gotcha.

893
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,396
A man!

894
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,615
Lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!

895
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,541
Oh, no!

896
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,344
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.

897
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:33,223
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.

898
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,767
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.

899
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:39,229
And this "wittle" piggy had...

900
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,398
Ran out of piggies.

901
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,443
Yah!

902
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:50,907
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without
a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?

903
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,075
Yeah.

904
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,493
Yeah. You could get killed.

905
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:56,997
- You guys got a spare?
- Bugs does.

906
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,124
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

907
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,669
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Better let him have it, Bugs.

908
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:06,465
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.

909
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,091
Thank you.

910
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,138
No!

911
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:16,975
- Poor fella.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

912
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,482
My man!

913
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:29,654
Come to Lena!

914
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,498
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

915
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,226
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

916
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,521
Valiant?

917
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,028
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

918
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,447
Behind you!

919
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,158
Drop it, lady!

920
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,202
I just saved your life,
and you still don't trust me?

921
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,539
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?

922
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:25,168
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon,
and Doom pulled the trigger.

923
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,379
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio,

924
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,089
but I was too late to stop him.

925
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,633
That's right!
You'll never stop me!

926
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,553
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!

927
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:39,724
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.

928
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,562
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!

929
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,021
Dum-dums.

930
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,565
- Come on.
- Yeah.

931
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,944
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?

932
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,737
He chickened out on me
back at the studio.

933
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:53,864
No, he didn't.

934
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,158
I hit him on the head with a frying pan
and put him in the trunk

935
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,701
so he wouldn't get hurt.

936
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,035
Makes perfect sense.

937
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,912
We're obviously not
going anywhere in my car.

938
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,080
Let's take yours.

939
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,085
I got a feeling somebody already did.

940
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,087
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.

941
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,132
My honey bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

942
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,926
- A better lover than a driver?
- You'd better believe it, buster.

943
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,013
It's the weasels. This way!

944
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,057
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!

945
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:23,185
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

946
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,770
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

947
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:29,524
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, mademoiselle.

948
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,446
So how long have you
known it was Doom?

949
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,532
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me

950
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:40,035
that Doom wanted
to get his hands on Toontown,

951
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,453
and he wouldn't stop at anything.

952
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,098
So he gave you the will
for safekeeping.

953
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,247
That's what he told me.

954
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:45,540
Except when I opened the envelope,

955
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,709
there was only
a blank piece of paper inside.

956
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,004
- A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?

957
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,673
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.

958
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,217
I'm so worried about him.

959
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,886
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?

960
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,304
He makes me laugh.

961
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,568
I've been dipped!

962
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:24,663
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing
more treacherous than a slippery road

963
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:28,333
especially when driving
in a maniacal Toon vehicle.

964
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,588
Good work, boss.

965
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,924
Don't just stand there. Help them.

966
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,385
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.

967
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:42,138
And I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.

968
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:44,099
Come on, you mugs.

969
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,824
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.

970
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:05,370
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.

971
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,878
Nice booby trap.

972
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,930
Do they have the will, or not?

973
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,891
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.

974
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:30,937
I doubt if that will is gonna show up
in the next 15 minutes anyway.

975
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:35,483
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.

976
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:37,694
Lock, stock and barrel.

977
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,702
Benny, is that you?

978
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:50,540
No, it's Shirley Temple!

979
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,459
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?

980
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:56,504
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

981
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,299
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!

982
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,510
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough driving for one night.

983
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,765
Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, boss.

984
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,519
You see, Mr. Valiant,
the successful conclusion of this case

985
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,648
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

986
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:19,486
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

987
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,197
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance?

988
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,950
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

989
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:33,958
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

990
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:37,754
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

991
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,839
This is no way to make a livin'.

992
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,469
Wouldn't you know. Locked.

993
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,981
Can you guess what this is?

994
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:03,613
Oh, my God! It's dip!

995
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:08,326
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!

996
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,540
A vehicle of my own design.

997
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,544
5,000 gallons of heated dip

998
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:21,714
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

999
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,302
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes.

1000
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,265
I suppose you think

1001
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,725
no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?

1002
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,144
Who's got time to wonder
what happened

1003
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,728
to some ridiculous talking mice

1004
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,773
when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?

1005
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,985
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.

1006
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,446
Not yet! Several months ago,

1007
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:48,992
I had the good providence to stumble
upon this plan of the city council's.

1008
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,370
A construction plan of epic proportions.

1009
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:55,748
They're calling it a freeway.

1010
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:59,294
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?

1011
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:03,339
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

1012
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,884
Smooth, safe, fast.

1013
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:08,803
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

1014
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,640
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?

1015
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,561
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.

1016
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:21,232
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

1017
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:25,737
On and off, off and on,
all day and all night!

1018
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:31,618
Soon, where Toontown once stood
will be a string of gas stations,

1019
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:36,956
inexpensive motels, restaurants
that serve rapidly prepared food,

1020
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:41,628
tire salons, automobile dealerships,

1021
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:45,298
and wonderful, wonderful billboards

1022
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,718
reaching as far as the eye can see!

1023
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:54,933
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!

1024
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,727
Nobody's gonna
drive this lousy freeway

1025
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,687
when they can take
the Red Car for a nickel.

1026
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,482
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.

1027
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:07,278
You see, I bought the Red Car
so I could dismantle it.

1028
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,989
What the...

1029
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:19,999
Ay, caramba!

1030
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,918
Okay, nobody move!

1031
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,004
All right, weasels, grab some sky
or I'll let the judge have it!

1032
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:28,007
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!

1033
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,593
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you,

1034
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,680
but first I have to satisfy
my sense of moral outrage!

1035
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,724
Put the gun down,
you bucktoothed fool!

1036
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:40,353
That's it, Doom! Give me another
excuse to pump you full of lead!

1037
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:42,564
You thought you could
get away with it, didn't ya?

1038
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:46,442
We Toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid!

1039
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:49,070
We demand justice,
but the real meaning of the word

1040
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,948
probably hits you like a ton of bricks!

1041
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,493
Roger!

1042
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,373
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!

1043
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,459
Ready when you are, Raoul.

1044
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,295
Tie the lovebirds together.

1045
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:14,053
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?

1046
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:18,433
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.

1047
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:21,102
Time to kill the rabbit.

1048
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,526
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.

1049
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:31,321
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.

1050
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,128
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

1051
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,632
I've loved you more than
any woman's ever loved a rabbit.

1052
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,886
It's over, Mr. Valiant.

1053
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,489
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.

1054
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:18,826
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

1055
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:25,583
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?

1056
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,921
Let him watch his Toon friends
get dipped, then shoot him.

1057
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,133
With pleasure.

1058
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:43,017
Everything's funny to you,
ain't it, needle nose?

1059
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:47,063
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

1060
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,856
Nah.

1061
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:52,777
I just want you to know something
about the guy you're gonna dip!

1062
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,912
Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game

1063
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,915
Come on, you dope, untie his rope
and watch him go insane

1064
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:20,513
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.

1065
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,520
This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme

1066
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,815
If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...

1067
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,484
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!

1068
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,849
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!

1069
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,685
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

1070
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:18,446
I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls

1071
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,865
Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...

1072
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:26,245
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!

1073
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,997
No, but this does!

1074
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,352
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!

1075
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:53,606
Jeepers, that was close!

1076
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,406
Bye-bye!

1077
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,535
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!

1078
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,554
- Oh, no!
- This is it!

1079
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,557
This isn't it!

1080
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:45,825
Wicked witchcraft

1081
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:51,205
And although I know

1082
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:55,793
It's strictly taboo

1083
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,671
When...

1084
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:23,696
Don't move.

1085
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,618
No. No!

1086
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,867
Yah!

1087
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,058
Oh, no!

1088
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,941
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!

1089
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,695
- P-p-please!
- Help!

1090
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,908
I wasn't worried. Were you?

1091
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:12,304
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!

1092
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,531
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!

1093
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,576
- Surprised?
- Not really.

1094
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,621
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a Toon.

1095
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,708
Not just any Toon!

1096
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,269
Remember me, Eddie?

1097
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,190
When I killed your brother, I talked

1098
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:07,276
just like this!

1099
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:18,454
Jumpin' jeepers.

1100
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:27,046
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

1101
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:32,736
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!

1102
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:42,204
I think I'm gonna faint.

1103
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,421
Oh, no!

1104
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,302
I'm melting!

1105
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,435
I'm melting! Melting!

1106
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:18,616
Eddie! Do something!

1107
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:20,868
Hurry up, Eddie!

1108
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,412
Do something!

1109
01:32:56,196 --> 01:33:00,324
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?

1110
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,852
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.

1111
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,522
I thought for sure
our goose was cooked!

1112
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:36,110
My hero.

1113
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,571
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.

1114
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:45,327
Oh, Roger, you were
a pillar of strength.

1115
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:53,836
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

1116
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,384
I've been a cab for 37 years

1117
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,386
and I've never seen a mess like this!

1118
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,139
What was that, a rubber mask?

1119
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,307
Yeah.

1120
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,852
And this is the rope from the safe
that was dropped on Acme.

1121
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:13,605
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

1122
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,900
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R. K. Maroon.

1123
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:18,444
And my brother.

1124
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,947
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed Toon.

1125
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,749
I wonder who he really was.

1126
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,835
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.

1127
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:36,754
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.

1128
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,505
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.

1129
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,840
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.

1130
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:44,386
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.

1131
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:47,765
That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

1132
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:51,060
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.

1133
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:53,729
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.

1134
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:57,858
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!

1135
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:01,653
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

1136
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:04,499
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball!

1137
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,574
- Roger.
- Yeah?

1138
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:08,535
That love letter you wrote to your wife
in the Ink and Paint Club.

1139
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,037
Why don't you read it to her now?

1140
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:13,957
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?"

1141
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:19,213
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme,
of sound mind and body..."

1142
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,048
- It's the will!
- Give me!

1143
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,550
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity"

1144
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,511
"the property known as Toontown"

1145
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:28,055
"to those lovable characters,
the Toons!"

1146
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:44,071
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

1147
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,990
Do you think your days
of being a sourpuss are over?

1148
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:51,078
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.

1149
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,204
Yeah.

1150
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,758
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humor already.

1151
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:10,013
Does this answer your question?

1152
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:16,645
Blech! Bleah!

1153
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,522
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

1154
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,774
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

1155
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:27,072
Smile, darn ya, smile

1156
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:32,453
You know, this old world
is a great world after all

1157
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,206
Smile, darn ya, smile

1158
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:41,170
And right away watch lady luck
pay you a call

1159
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:46,133
Things are never black
as they are painted

1160
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,553
Time for you and joy
to get acquainted

1161
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,806
Okay, m-m-move along.
T-T-There's nothing else to see.

1162
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:54,391
That's all, folks.

1163
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,602
I like the sound of that.

1164
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:00,022
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
