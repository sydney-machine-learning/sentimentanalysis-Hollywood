00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Synched and corrected by Fingersmaster.
Enjoy !

2
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,728
- Did you make a wish?
- Yeah.

3
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:03,381
No lunch. I got speech class.

4
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:07,327
What do you need speech class for?
You talk fine.

5
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,513
All right. I'll pick you up at five,
we'll ride back together.

6
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:14,225
I can't. I got Emerging Markets
seminar at 5.30.

7
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:18,980
Jeez, it's your birthday. Can't they
emerge without you just this once?

8
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,608
- What time is my surprise party?
- What?

9
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,234
Come on.

10
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,237
I'm supposed to take you to drinks
and have you home at seven.

11
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,324
I'll cut out early and be home at 7.15, OK?

12
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:32,160
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

13
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,812
- Morning, Tess.
- Morning.

14
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,565
- Hi, Tess.
- Hi.

15
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,701
Mr Turkel's line.

16
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,163
Who's calling, please?

17
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,542
Hold on a moment.

18
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,669
Mr Lutz?

19
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:28,341
Hold on a second, all right?

20
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,809
Mr Turkel?

21
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:44,023
Mr Alagash... Hi.

22
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:48,778
- Mr Alagash is real anxious to talk to you.
- You couldn't maybe get him to hold?

23
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:51,573
You got him in Dentitech -
the one I said go short on.

24
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,534
It's fine, but he don't wanna
hear it from a secretary.

25
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:57,704
- There's no paper.
- What?

26
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:02,500
There is no goddamned paper
in this stall. Get me some?

27
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:13,219
Thanks. You're very kind.

28
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:24,856
You're short on Dentitech at 18.
He'll be right here.

29
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:46,294
See Dentitech closing? 17 and 1/8. Come Monday,
I bet it's 16 and still sittin' there.

30
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,507
- How you figure?
- They went public at 23 with one product.

31
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,926
Plaque-removing mouthwash?

32
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,221
You rinse, you get this glob of plaque
you gotta spit out.

33
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:58,973
Maybe it'll be big, but no one ever got rich

34
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:03,228
overestimating what
the American public wants to taste.

35
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:05,188
Maybe.

36
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:10,944
Before I run, Tess, I have some
good news and some bad news.

37
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:17,325
The straight shot is they turned you down
for the entrée programme again.

38
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:19,702
- Why?
- We did all we could, Tessy.

39
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:22,831
You've got to remember you're up against
Harvard and Wharton graduates.

40
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:26,668
You've got some night school,
some secretarial time on your sheet.

41
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,921
- Christians and lions, Tess.
- That's right.

42
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:33,174
- And the good news?
- Dave has a friend.

43
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:38,555
Bob in Arbitrage. You're so hungry,
they're looking for hungry down there.

44
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,933
- Really?
- Hungry's the name of the game down there.

45
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,603
Bob's looking for a new assistant
and wants to meet you for a drink.

46
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,439
This isn't another setup?

47
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:52,777
Do I look like a pimp?

48
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,036
Bob says he's looking for hungry,
I think to myself "Tess". The rest is up to you.

49
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,123
- Bob in Arbitrage.
- Bob Speck.

50
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:08,168
Extension 256. Expecting your call.

51
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,420
Go get 'em, Tessy.

52
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:17,385
You should have told us.
Congratulations, Tessy.

53
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,812
Thanks.

54
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,074
Mick?

55
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,843
Surprise.

56
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,389
Happy birthday.

57
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,611
You look great.

58
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,915
Come here.

59
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:35,088
You know, Mick, just once I could go for,
like, a sweater or some earrings.

60
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:40,176
You know? A present that I can
actually wear outside of this apartment.

61
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:53,773
So...

62
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:57,402
Is this where you usually meet for drinks?

63
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:01,448
This is a big week.
A super week. We are celebrating.

64
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:05,660
So, Arbitrage. Talk about adrenaline, huh?

65
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:09,622
What do you think is the most
important quality for a great arbitrager?

66
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:13,668
- Well, we'll go through all that at the hotel.
- The hotel?

67
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:16,253
The company keeps a suite
at the Ritz Carlton.

68
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:19,340
When it's empty they give it
to us boys on a bonus basis.

69
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,843
We're gonna party.

70
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,596
I'm sorry. Allow me. I'm so sorry.

71
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,850
- Hey, Bob. Please.
- Sorry, I just... I get a little carried away.

72
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:35,231
You know what? Arbitrage has put out this sort of
"Introduction to..." tape for the business schools.

73
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:40,153
- Why don't we put it in. If you have any questions...
- That would be great. Thanks.

74
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,500
It's the wrong tape. Unless of course you...

75
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,420
Bob, you're not seriously looking
for a new assistant, are you?

76
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:01,090
Not exactly at this moment. But I'm always
on the lookout for new blood.

77
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,426
I am hungry, Bob, but I am not that hungry.

78
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,637
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.

79
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,308
- Would you just pull over right here, please?
- What are you doing?

80
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,438
Party, Bob.

81
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,218
Hello, Tess.

82
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,348
You're late, Tess.

83
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,287
Yo, David.

84
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,628
Little bitch.

85
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,173
You gotta see this to believe it.

86
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,842
Take it easy.

87
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,802
Bastard.

88
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,765
- Tess... Tess... Tess...
- I know.

89
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:36,978
You don't get ahead in this world
by calling your boss a pimp.

90
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,439
Well, he is.

91
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,627
Been lookin' at your file here.

92
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:45,028
This is the third time in six months
I've had to place you.

93
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:48,823
- It wasn't my fault.
- Where have I heard that before?

94
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,034
Ruth, look it.
I'm 30 years old.

95
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:54,913
It took me five years of night school,
but I got my degree with honours.

96
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,123
I know I could do a job.

97
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:01,920
Ask any of my bosses, even Lutz,
if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.

98
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:06,341
You ask 'em. I don't think
they're gonna sing your praises, Tess.

99
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:15,558
Here's something for you.
Transferring down from Boston.

100
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:21,147
Mergers and Acquisitions.
Name is Parker. Starts Monday.

101
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,566
- You go home and cool off.
- OK.

102
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,985
Tess...

103
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:31,366
This is the last time I can help you.
Four strikes, you're out.

104
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,253
- Tess McGill for Katharine Parker's office.
- It's the last desk. At the end of the aisle.

105
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,437
Hi. I'm Katharine Parker. You must be Tess.

106
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,355
Hi.

107
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:47,484
Great bunny.

108
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:53,323
I don't usually have a bunny on my desk.
It was my birthday a few days ago.

109
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,993
- No kidding. Mine's next Tuesday. How old?
- 30.

110
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:01,289
Really? Well, I'll be 30 next Tuesday.
We're practically twins.

111
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:05,293
- Except I'm older.
- Just barely.

112
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:10,965
I've never worked for somebody who was
younger than me before. Or for a woman.

113
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,678
Well, there's a first time for everything.
It's not going to be a problem, is it, Tess?

114
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,972
- No.
- Good.

115
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:23,728
Why don't you pour us a couple of coffees
and come on inside? I'm light, no sugar.

116
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,528
The stock is at 38, the tender's at 56.

117
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,364
Come in.

118
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,658
Yeah, what do we do about that?

119
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:40,161
Well, I just checked my three.
What are yours?

120
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:43,706
Yeah, I have that one.

121
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,459
I think he's in an underwater position.

122
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:50,797
All right. That's our first and second call,
and then we'll see where we are.

123
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,967
I'll count the minutes. Bye.

124
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,969
Thanks.

125
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,806
So, Tess, a few ground rules.

126
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,101
The way I look at it,
you are my link with the outside world.

127
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,645
People's impression of me starts with you.

128
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:09,315
You're tough when it's warranted,
accommodating when you can be.

129
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,153
You're accurate. You're punctual.
You never make a promise you can't keep.

130
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:16,156
I'm never on another line, I'm in a meeting.

131
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:19,701
I consider us a team, Tess,
and as such we have a uniform.

132
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:22,078
Simple, elegant, impeccable.

133
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:26,916
"Dress shabbily, they notice the dress.
Dress impeccably, they notice the woman."

134
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,085
Coco Chanel.

135
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,631
How do I look?

136
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:38,136
You look terrific.
You might wanna rethink the jewellery.

137
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:45,185
I want your input, Tess. I welcome your ideas
and I like to see hard work rewarded.

138
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:49,606
It's a two-way street on my team.
Am I making myself clear?

139
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,066
Yes, Katharine.

140
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:57,363
- And call me Katharine.
- OK.

141
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:01,117
So, let's get to work, shall we?

142
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:07,373
This department's profile last year was damn pitiful.
Our team's got its work cut out for it.

143
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,251
OK. Thanks.

144
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:16,508
Damn. I forgot my pills again.
It's the third time this month.

145
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:19,135
Did you hear about that shot
they got in Europe?

146
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:23,556
They're giving it to women, in their arm.
It's good for five years.

147
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,850
Damn pills. I'm always forgetting 'em.

148
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:31,898
- I thought you might like this.
- Thank you.

149
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,654
Tess, would you come in here, please,
and bring a notebook?

150
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,532
They've sold the paper and printing divisions.

151
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:44,702
They sell Distribution too,
we're talking real scorched earth.

152
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,996
Come on in.

153
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,333
Tess, this is Ginny. Ginny, Tess.

154
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:55,421
Being new in town, I thought I'd throw a little
cocktail thing to introduce myself to the department.

155
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:59,801
Ginny here has some great ideas.
Will you jot them down?

156
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:03,888
The caterer is called Acme Eats.
You can get the number from Information.

157
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,266
They do the usual hors d'oeuvres and such.

158
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,853
The Raging Bull has a bartender service.

159
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:13,231
And the liquor store
on Broadway and Liberty delivers.

160
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:16,568
- Got that, Bess?
- Tess, yeah.

161
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:21,114
- If that's the way that you wanna go.
- You have another idea?

162
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:25,827
Well, I was just reading in W about dim sum -
these little Chinese dumplings.

163
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:29,539
A restaurant on Mott Street
does them for cocktail parties.

164
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:33,626
- I love those little dumplings.
- It might be more fun than the usual tidbits.

165
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,714
- I have it on my desk. I could get it.
- You read W?

166
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:42,927
I read a lot of things. You never know
where the big ideas could come from.

167
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:47,640
I guess you're right. If dumplings
can be considered a big idea.

168
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:52,145
- Well, that oughta get you started...
- Ginny, thank you so much.

169
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,773
- Back to the gold mines.
- Right.

170
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,983
- You'll set those up?
- Right away.

171
00:17:57,066 --> 00:18:00,403
Dim sum, Tess. I like it, contribution-wise.

172
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,739
Keep it up.

173
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:09,204
The chief says "We will respect your wish.
We will give you an honourable death."

174
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,372
"But first, keke."

175
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:15,126
Excuse me. Excuse me.

176
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:18,755
- Dim sum?
- Yes, yes.

177
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:27,514
Come on, Katharine. What do you say?

178
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:32,268
Jim, the man who spends
every weekend in August glued to his desk,

179
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,772
that man knows that I can't
just sneak out of my own party.

180
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:41,486
I'll tell you what, though. You get me
in on the Southeast Air divestiture plan,

181
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:45,824
I'll buy you a drink.
Bottle of Cristal, two straws.

182
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:50,161
- Deal?
- Okey-dokey.

183
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,289
- Dim sum?
- Hi.

184
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,334
Thank you. What a slob.

185
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:59,045
You were so smooth with him.
I probably would have...

186
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:04,050
Never burn bridges. Today's junior prick,
tomorrow's senior partner.

187
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:08,179
- So, how do you think the party's going?
- Pretty well, I think.

188
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:11,182
Should I stop serving now?

189
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,726
- Better make one more round.
- Right.

190
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,814
I'd love to help you, but we can't busy
the quarterback with passing out the Gatorade.

191
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:20,316
Arnie, my hero. You've come.

192
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,582
Yeah?

193
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,171
I have an idea
and you said I could come to you.

194
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,381
Shoot.

195
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:51,097
Well, you know how Trask Industries
has been looking to buy into broadcasting?

196
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,808
- Something about that the department is...
- Working on it, yeah.

197
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:58,730
I've been following it myself,
and all of a sudden I thought "radio".

198
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:03,151
- Trask is looking for television stations.
- So is every Tom, Dick and Harry.

199
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,863
My idea is that they get their feet wet in radio
and build from there.

200
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,657
It's not as glamorous
as jumping right into TV,

201
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,661
but it's a solid place to start
and there's a lot more of them for sale.

202
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:18,166
Plus it would solve Trask's problem with
the Japanese competitors trying to take him over,

203
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:22,128
because FCC forbids foreign ownership
of radio as well as TV.

204
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:31,471
Interesting. You've been
following this, you say?

205
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,223
Yeah.

206
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:37,560
No chance you overheard it,
say on the elevator?

207
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:41,356
- No, no way.
- Somewhere.

208
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,650
It's my idea.

209
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,277
Good, good.

210
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:53,910
- Discuss it with anyone else?
- Nope. You think there's something there?

211
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:56,041
Well, I can think it through for you.

212
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,289
Why don't you leave me your notes?
I'll have a look-see.

213
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,416
OK.

214
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,629
I've been trying to get into the entrée
programme and this would be a big push.

215
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:08,424
- If anything happens, you'll...
- Absolutely, Tess.

216
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:11,261
Two-way street, remember?

217
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:13,429
Yeah, thank you.

218
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,955
It's just... It's so exciting.
I mean, she takes me seriously.

219
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,210
I know you hate when I say this,
but I think it's because she's a woman.

220
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:47,380
There's none of that
chasing-around-the-desk crap.

221
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:51,718
And it's like she wants to be my mentor,
which is exactly what I needed.

222
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,429
I feel like I'm finally gettin' somewhere.

223
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:59,350
That's great, but let's step on it
or the pizza's gonna freeze, honey.

224
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:04,481
Maybe we could all go out sometime.
Dinner in the city.

225
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:07,108
You would like her, I think.

226
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,653
God. Remember when all you had to do
was a few buckles?

227
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:13,406
Yeah. Those were the days.

228
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,745
I called the inn. All they can give you
is a ground-floor single in the new wing.

229
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:22,457
Did you tell them it was me?

230
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,793
Well, I said Parker.

231
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:08,586
It's this tower room with a canopy bed
and a fireplace big enough to stand in.

232
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,423
Perfect. Everything's in place.

233
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:17,679
- For what?
- The man I've been seeing for a while.

234
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:22,600
I think he's it. And I think
this could be the weekend we decide.

235
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:26,938
He said there was something very important
he wanted to discuss with me.

236
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:29,107
I think he's gonna pop the question.

237
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,067
- You do?
- I think so.

238
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:35,488
We're in the same city now.
I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer.

239
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,367
I've cleared the month of June.
And I am, after all, me.

240
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,830
What if he doesn't pop the question?

241
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,710
I really don't think that's a variable.

242
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:54,799
Tess, you don't get anywhere in this world
by waiting for what you want to come to you.

243
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:57,677
You make it happen.

244
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,055
Watch me, Tess. Learn from me.

245
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:08,062
By the way, I ran your Trask radio idea
by some of our people.

246
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,066
It seems Trask is dead set on television.

247
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,695
But it wasn't out in left field either.
I really liked the idea.

248
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,992
You just keep plugging and bring me
your ideas, and we'll see what we can do.

249
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,245
- Thank you, Katharine.
- Tess...

250
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,667
Look at me. Who makes it happen?

251
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,380
I do.

252
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:37,300
Who does?

253
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:39,677
I do. I make it happen.

254
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:43,640
That's right. Only then
do we get what we deserve.

255
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:11,126
Miss Parker's office.

256
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,211
Hi, Katharine.

257
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:16,256
- You what?
- Broke it. Skiing.

258
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:21,553
They won't be able to move me for two weeks,
so this is what I need you to do.

259
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:23,930
Water plants. OK.

260
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,475
Cable comes on Friday.

261
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,978
Easy with the leg, will you?

262
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,272
Quit staring up my gown.

263
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:37,110
Now, I'm staying at my parents' house
and the housekeeper is in Barbados.

264
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:40,947
What a mess. You need to let in
the flower man and the cleaning lady.

265
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,160
Sort through the mail.
The entrance code for the front door is...

266
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,998
It's 754-3-2000.

267
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:52,876
I know there's more, but I can't think of what.

268
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:57,964
Go through the calendar on my desk.
There's a bunch of invitations to be RSVP'd.

269
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:03,094
I know I'm asking an awful lot, Tess,
but I don't know what else to do.

270
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:07,056
- I need you to take over.
- OK. Bye.

271
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:29,305
Regarding those horrid little
knick-knacks from the Alberts...

272
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:33,268
Dear Eleanor and Gary.
Thank you for the salt and pepper shakers.

273
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:39,399
Not only are they the perfect house-warming
gift, but it was so dear of you to think of me.

274
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,655
Dear Sister. It's hard to believe it's been eight
years since we said goodbye to Wellesley,

275
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:48,575
but of course we never really say goodbye.

276
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:52,912
On behalf of the Alumni Giving Fund,
I am writing to you to ask...

277
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:03,590
Dear Sister. It's hard to believe it's been eight
years since we said goodbye to Wellesley,

278
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:06,342
but of course we never really say goodbye.

279
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,680
On behalf of the Alumni Giving Fund,
I am writing to you to ask...

280
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,353
To ask... To a... To ask... To... ask...

281
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:21,441
I am writing to you to ask...

282
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,778
Dear Momo and Baa.

283
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:27,280
Here I am living in Mummy's house

284
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:31,493
while I brave the New York real-estate market
looking for a place of my own.

285
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:36,915
I miss you all terribly, but it will be so lovely
to see you when you return from Barbados.

286
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:40,919
Till then, have fun. Much love to you
and, of course, to Claudette.

287
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,129
Love, Kiki.

288
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,884
To Jack Trainer,
Dewey Stone & Company, from me.

289
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:51,387
Re: Trask Industries -
radio network acquisition.

290
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:56,518
Hard copy on this from the home
computer. Do not go through Tess.

291
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,358
To Jack Trainer,
Dewey Stone & Company, from me.

Re: Trask Industries -

294
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,386
"Two-way street."

295
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,472
And "You make it happen".

296
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,517
- What? No class?
- No class.

297
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,605
Tess, this is not what it looks like.

298
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,816
I mean, it is what it looks like,
but I can explain.

299
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:30,737
- Well, not exactly explain.
- You snake.

300
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,282
Shit.

301
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,793
Come on, Tess. I'm sorry, I really am.

302
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:48,379
I love you. Come on.

303
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:51,216
Come back and hit me.

304
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,884
Please.

305
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:40,932
Hello. Mr Trainer's office, please?

306
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:46,563
Hello. Tess McGill calling from Petty Marsh.
May I put her through?

307
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:48,731
Thank you.

308
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,820
Mr Trainer?

309
00:31:53,903 --> 00:31:59,742
Hi, this is Tess McGill. I work with Katharine
Parker over here in Mergers and Acquisitions.

310
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:03,580
I have a proposal that
I'd like to discuss with you.

311
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,249
Not over the phone, though.

312
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,545
I have an opening
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

313
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,465
OK.

314
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:17,385
I'll messenger an outline
over to you right now.

315
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,429
Bye.

316
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:42,994
Yes, I'm calling for Katharine Parker
in regard to your invitation.

317
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:47,499
Miss Parker is out of town, but Miss Tess
McGill will be attending in her place.

318
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,042
Yes. Thank you.

319
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:04,516
Why does it do that?

320
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,103
- For cleaning.
- Are you kiddin' me?

321
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,271
No.

322
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:16,945
What is this thing you're going to anyway?

323
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,324
The closing party for the Minidyne-Dalton
merger. Dewey Stone is throwing it.

324
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:24,661
That's where Trainer works.
It's the perfect time to meet him.

325
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:28,540
Mix business with pleasure.
Fringe times are crucial.

326
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,084
What'd you do, snatch her invite?

327
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,294
Well, she can't use it.

328
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,799
It's important for me to start interacting
with people, not as a secretary...

329
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,552
But as a total impostor. Right.

330
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,182
This is it.

331
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:51,104
It needs some bows or somethin'.

332
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:55,483
No. It's simple, elegant,
yet makes a statement.

333
00:33:55,567 --> 00:34:00,280
Says to people: confident, a risk-taker,
not afraid to be noticed.

334
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:05,034
Then you hit 'em with your smarts.
Here. Shoes. I need shoes.

335
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,540
$6,000? It's not even leather.

336
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,878
$6,000?

337
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:20,300
$6,000.

338
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:25,013
- Cyn, I can't breathe so good.
- Oh, God. Come here.

339
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:29,058
Sit down. Let's see
if she's got anything soothing.

340
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:46,451
Valium. In the convenient economy size.

341
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,078
- You sure?
- Just chills you ever so slightly.

342
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:51,623
You won't even notice it.

343
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,048
Are you sure about this?

344
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:04,093
You wanna be taken seriously,
you need serious hair.

345
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,933
Go for the jugular. Look, I've been
telling you this for thre weeks.

346
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,716
There are 19 million shares outstanding.

347
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,303
We got 25%. We get another 5%,
we've got 'em by the throat.

348
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:50,140
- Trainer, let's grab 'em by the balls.
- Leave our hearts at home.

349
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:55,770
Cut 'em off at the knees. They'll be
eating out of our hands. What do you say?

350
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:59,065
- Anybody thirsty?
- We need this one, Trainer.

351
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:02,277
- You need this one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:19,210
- I've been looking for you.
- Why? Do you know me?

353
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:24,382
No, but I promised myself that,
when I saw you, I would get to know you.

354
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:28,219
You're the first woman I've seen in one of
these damn things that dresses like a woman,

355
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:32,056
not like a woman thinks
a man would dress if he was a woman.

356
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,894
- Thank you, I guess.
- What are you doing here?

357
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm looking for someone myself. His name
is Jack Trainer. He works at Dewey Stone.

358
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:43,151
Do you know if he's here?

359
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,528
Why are you looking for him?

360
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:48,072
Well, because I have a meeting with him tomorrow.

361
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:52,368
I thought it might be nice
to say hello and get a head start.

362
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:57,040
Well, he just left.

363
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:05,507
- I should be going myself.
- Have a drink with me.

364
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,718
I can't. What's your name?

365
00:37:08,802 --> 00:37:11,971
No. No names. No business cards.

366
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,516
- No "You must know so and so".
- What is this?

367
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,478
No résumés. Let's just meet
like human beings for once.

368
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:24,651
It's nice to meet you, whatever your name is,
but I really do have to go.

369
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:28,154
Please. Please. One drink.

370
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:34,160
OK, one drink. But I'm buying.

371
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:36,329
OK, but it's an open bar.

372
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:39,415
I knew that. I meant that
if it wasn't, I would be buying.

373
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:40,959
Yeah.

374
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,796
- Tequila Gold. Doubles.
- Tequila?

375
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:49,551
Yeah. I promised myself that
when we met we'd drink tequila.

376
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:53,221
No Chardonnay, no frog water.

377
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,598
Real drinks.

378
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:11,739
These things are usually so boring.

379
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:17,120
I wouldn't know.

380
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:21,499
Power to the people.

381
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,918
The little people.

382
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:32,760
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

383
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,472
Oh boy, oh boy...

384
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:38,850
- You OK?
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

385
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:46,316
I took an antihistamine before,
and it just makes for a nice little buzz.

386
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:52,113
I didn't know they let
bad girls into these things.

387
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,450
- Do I look like I don't belong here?
- No.

388
00:38:55,533 --> 00:39:01,790
No, no. I'm sure you're a real ace
at whatever it is that you do do.

389
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:06,169
- Damn straight.
- But how you look...

390
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:13,218
I have a head for business and a bod for sin.

391
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:16,763
Is there anything wrong with that?

392
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:18,932
No... No.

393
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,814
Hello. Hi.

394
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,149
I have to go now.

395
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,902
- I'll come with you.
- No.

396
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,905
Hey, Tess.

397
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,837
I need some air. Meet me outside. Thank you.

398
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,388
Excuse me.

399
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:18,199
Hello?

400
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,326
- Hi.
- Hi.

401
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,670
Where do you live?

402
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,466
Where do you live?

403
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:39,888
Park, trees, tall building.

404
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:45,226
- 166 Morton. Near Hudson.
- 166 Morton.

405
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,867
Might be kind of a mess.

406
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,872
The cleaning lady
keeps changing days on me.

407
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:08,124
Anybody's guess.

408
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:14,130
I'm just warning you cos,
if it's the day before, it could be pretty bad.

409
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:23,890
I don't notice so much myself,
but some of the people I've had over have,

410
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,602
you know, remarked on it.

411
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:42,117
It's not so bad.

412
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:30,331
Would you...

413
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,168
Would you like a nightcap?

414
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,797
I guess not.

415
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:42,969
I guess it's too late for coffee.

416
00:42:44,804 --> 00:42:48,332
Herb tea? Herb tea...?

417
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:52,020
I don't have any.

418
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:56,900
It always sounds good when people
offer it to me when I'm in your shape.

419
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,404
I might have a little brandy myself.

420
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:08,036
Boy...

421
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,580
You sure are pretty.

422
00:44:46,968 --> 00:44:50,305
Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up.

423
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,357
Hi. Tess McGill to see Jack Trainer.

424
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:04,360
- May I take your coat?
- Yes, please.

425
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,962
Gentlemen, Tess McGill.

426
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:28,843
Miss McGill, I'm Jack Trainer.

427
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,431
How are you?

428
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:35,934
This is John Romano and Bernie Kotar.

429
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,728
Sit down, please.

430
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:45,735
- Coffee?
- Sure.

431
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:49,823
- Milk or sugar?
- Both, thank you.

432
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:55,912
I suppose we should just get right down to it.

433
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:58,081
Sure.

434
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:02,585
I've lost my briefcase.

435
00:46:05,004 --> 00:46:09,134
In each of the last three quarters,
Trask Industries has announced plans

436
00:46:09,217 --> 00:46:14,514
to acquire a major market television station,
each time unsuccessfully.

437
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:18,977
At the same time they've expended time
and money fighting off a hostile takeover attempt

438
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:22,939
by one of their Japanese competitors.

439
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:27,569
Buying into radio would, in one fell swoop
accomplish two important tasks.

440
00:46:27,902 --> 00:46:31,072
It would give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting,

441
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:35,660
and, because of FCC regulations forbidding
foreign ownership of radio stations,

442
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:39,914
it would wipe out the threat
of a Japanese takeover.

443
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:45,920
Interesting idea.

444
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,090
But I don't like it.

445
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,218
Trask has got a lot of cash
on their balance sheet.

446
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:57,682
That's why they're a takeover target.
A radio station is small potatoes.

447
00:46:57,807 --> 00:47:00,143
I can't see him biting.

448
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:02,854
I've already thought of that.

449
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:07,525
I figure that we look for a radio network -
one with a real high profile.

450
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:13,281
And with the surplus cash,
we implement a major stock repurchase.

451
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:18,161
So Trask is protected and their stock goes up,
and everybody's happy.

452
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,127
Or not.

453
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,672
Shoot me. Just shoot me.

454
00:47:29,756 --> 00:47:33,676
Would you cut that out?
They didn't throw you out, did they?

455
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,642
Well, they don't exactly have bouncers.
They're a little more subtle than that, Cyn.

456
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,645
Oh, God. And last night.

457
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:48,066
Yeah. I should've checked the milligrams.
Live and learn.

458
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:54,030
Maybe he'll feel sorry for you, and make it
up to you doing your deal or whatever it is.

459
00:47:54,114 --> 00:47:59,577
I'm not looking for sympathy.
You know, I had a shot at...

460
00:48:02,455 --> 00:48:04,499
It's him. He's here.

461
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:08,378
Do me a favour. Be me. Be my secretary.

462
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:11,422
- Tess.
- Cyn, please, do it for me.

463
00:48:11,506 --> 00:48:13,591
OK...

464
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:15,593
Tess.

465
00:48:24,352 --> 00:48:27,647
- May I help you?
- Jack Trainer to see Miss McGill.

466
00:48:31,443 --> 00:48:34,529
Let's give her a shout, shall we?

467
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:38,992
You decent?

468
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:43,705
A Mr Jack Trainer to see you, Miss McGill.

469
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,123
Thank you, Cynthia.

470
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:48,334
- Hold all calls, Miss McGill?
- Yes, Cynthia. Thank you.

471
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:52,213
Can I get you anything, Mr Trainer?
Coffee? Tea? Me?

472
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,719
Isn't she a riot? That'll be all, Cynthia.

473
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:01,264
Why did you say you weren't you last night?

474
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:05,685
Because I knew what would happen.
All mergers and acquisitions.

475
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:08,980
No lust and tequila.

476
00:49:10,482 --> 00:49:16,362
That was... That just happened, OK?
I wanna make it clear...

477
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,867
What did happen exactly?

478
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,120
The earth moved. The angels wept.

479
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:27,665
The Polaroids are...

480
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,960
are in my other coat.

481
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,840
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

482
00:49:35,924 --> 00:49:38,927
I woke up in my underwear.

483
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,596
I'll bet you looked nice.

484
00:49:43,098 --> 00:49:45,850
Did you get me that way?

485
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:50,855
I... I took off your shoes and dress,
I put you on the bed.

486
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:54,192
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

487
00:49:54,275 --> 00:49:56,569
And that was it?

488
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:59,739
I might have peeked. I don't remember.

489
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:03,576
Look, I don't have all day to hang out here
and discuss your sex life.

490
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,162
Here.

491
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:08,998
- What's this?
- Open it.

492
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,928
What's this for?

493
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:27,642
I thought you could use a better briefcase
if we're gonna put this deal together.

494
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:31,146
- You liked it.
- It has possibilities.

495
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:34,190
I wanna go first to Metro Radio Systems.

496
00:50:34,274 --> 00:50:37,527
They're a solid family-owned,
mid-sized network in the South.

497
00:50:37,652 --> 00:50:40,363
They had offers before and rejected 'em, but

498
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:43,575
the father's about to retire,
and the son's just been forced out

499
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:46,828
by his board of directors.
A lot of squabbling. A good time to go in.

500
00:50:47,787 --> 00:50:48,788
OK.

501
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,001
Why didn't you just put it together
with your people here? Why come to us?

502
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,423
Will you excuse me for one second?

503
00:50:58,506 --> 00:51:00,592
Sure.

504
00:51:02,385 --> 00:51:04,554
You're not helping. No.

505
00:51:04,637 --> 00:51:08,099
Bess, my computer's down.
I need Katharine's office right away.

506
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:10,894
Sure. Of course. No problem.
I'll be with you in five minutes.

507
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:14,272
- I need it five minutes ago.
- I'll be right with you.

508
00:51:14,397 --> 00:51:17,525
- What's going on in there?
- She's dusting.

509
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:24,199
Jack, listen. My one o'clock is getting a little antsy,
so can I walk you to the elevator?

510
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:27,202
Sure, but first answer my question.

511
00:51:28,036 --> 00:51:30,330
Right.

512
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:33,082
I came to you because

513
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:37,462
I wanted an ace on this. The best.

514
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:41,090
Good thinking.

515
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:45,428
Well, I'll fly down to Memphis
in the morning and feel them out.

516
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:49,057
Absolutely. Fine.

517
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:58,316
-...you'll just have to wait.
- Ginny, go right in. I'll be with you in a minute.

518
00:51:58,399 --> 00:52:00,777
What are you talking about?

519
00:52:05,698 --> 00:52:08,952
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?

520
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:12,664
- Are you free for dinner tonight?
- No, sorry.

521
00:52:13,915 --> 00:52:16,000
How about tomorrow?
I'll be back around eight.

522
00:52:16,084 --> 00:52:19,170
- I can't.
- When, then?

523
00:52:19,254 --> 00:52:22,924
I don't think we should
get involved that way.

524
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,927
What are you talking about?
What about last night?

525
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,806
Look, I'm not that girl.
Last night was special.

526
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:33,560
It wasn't so special. I had to
carry you up three flights of stairs.

527
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:36,229
I meant unusual special.

528
00:52:36,312 --> 00:52:39,649
Look, we're in a business deal
together now,

529
00:52:39,774 --> 00:52:42,777
and I just don't think we should
get involved that way.

530
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:45,321
My life is real complicated as it is.

531
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:49,367
I don't wanna complicate it either.
I just thought dinner, maybe a movie.

532
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:53,580
- We both know what we're talking about.
- I certainly hope so.

533
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:56,583
You know, maybe I just don't like you.

534
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,960
Me? Nah.

535
00:53:25,153 --> 00:53:28,031
- You sure she's gonna show?
- It's my engagement party.

536
00:53:28,114 --> 00:53:31,367
She knows she's dead meat if she doesn't.

537
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:37,123
Hi, Tess.

538
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,005
I'm real sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

539
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:47,675
You're gonna be outta work,
you keep scamming like you are.

540
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:52,597
Look, I'm nervous as hell and I think Mick's
about to drown himself in a Scotch bottle.

541
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,308
- He's bad, huh?
- Throw him a bone, will ya?

542
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:58,520
I want happy humans here tonight.

543
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,453
Tess.

544
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:17,664
Snake.

545
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:23,419
You look different.

546
00:54:23,503 --> 00:54:27,507
I'm not the same pathetic, trusting fool
that I was a couple of days ago.

547
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,552
- It shows, huh?
- Hey, Tess. How you doin'? What are you havin'?

548
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:33,388
Stow this behind the bar for me,
will you, Tony?

549
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,142
And I'll have a Chivas,
and buy Mick one of whatever.

550
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:39,310
You got it.

551
00:54:40,728 --> 00:54:45,066
No, I just meant the hair, the duds,
and the briefcase. What's goin' on?

552
00:54:45,191 --> 00:54:48,778
- Make fun if you want.
- No, no. You look good.

553
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:51,865
Classy.

554
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:56,161
Did you have to go
to traffic court or somethin'?

555
00:54:56,244 --> 00:55:00,081
No, I just got off work.
I sort of got a promotion.

556
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,918
Well...

557
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:06,963
To Cyn and Tim.

558
00:55:07,046 --> 00:55:09,340
To you and me.

559
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:11,634
To you and your promotion.

560
00:55:11,718 --> 00:55:15,680
- To me getting a boat loan.
- You what? You did?

561
00:55:15,764 --> 00:55:20,560
My loan was approved just this morning.
Put a down payment on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.

562
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:22,979
That's so great.

563
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:18,910
"Hours of fun for the entire family.
Love, Tess and Mick."

564
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,078
Thank you.

565
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:26,918
I put from both of us. I didn't know
if you'd gotten something or what.

566
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,921
OK, toast. We need a toast.

567
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:32,507
Thank you. Thank you.

568
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,301
From me and Tess and everybody here,

569
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:40,807
may your life together be long and happy,
and may the road always rise up to meet you.

570
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:47,355
When are we gonna toast
the two of you, Mick?

571
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:53,903
- We haven't really discussed it. Not recently.
- No.

572
00:56:53,987 --> 00:56:56,865
You don't discuss it, boy. You just ask.

573
00:56:58,116 --> 00:56:59,742
Here?

574
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:03,455
- Now?
- On your knees, man.

575
00:57:04,914 --> 00:57:08,877
Mick.

576
00:57:22,891 --> 00:57:25,185
Tess, will you marry me?

577
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,355
Maybe.

578
00:57:30,607 --> 00:57:33,067
That's an answer?

579
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:37,572
You want another answer, ask another girl.

580
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,841
- You fuckin' humiliated us in there.
- You set us up, doing it like that.

581
00:57:56,925 --> 00:58:00,845
What did you expect me to do?
Lie in front of all of those people?

582
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:03,973
Didn't know you'd have to lie.
I thought you'd want me to ask.

583
00:58:04,057 --> 00:58:06,851
Three nights ago,
I find you in bed with Doreen.

584
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:11,064
We have a drink, a dance, and boom -
you want an answer about the rest of my life.

585
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:12,774
All right. OK.

586
00:58:12,899 --> 00:58:16,069
Here we are, just the two of us.
Will you marry me or what?

587
00:58:16,152 --> 00:58:18,738
Jesus, Mick.
Do we have to decide this right now?

588
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,741
I want to get things solidified.
Things in my life.

589
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:24,619
You're not the only one
who's got plans, you know.

590
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,830
- I said maybe.
- Maybe means dick.

591
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:29,165
Fuck maybe. I want an answer now.

592
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:32,710
Please don't yell at me.
You treat me like I'm...

593
00:58:32,794 --> 00:58:35,255
Why do we always talk about
how you get treated?

594
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:38,800
Who the fuck died
and made you Grace Kelly?

595
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:42,554
I am not steak. You can't just order me.

596
00:58:42,637 --> 00:58:45,974
Look, I don't need this. You get
your priorities straight, maybe we'll talk.

597
00:58:46,057 --> 00:58:48,601
Right now, we're history.

598
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:19,507
Katharine Parker's office.

599
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:23,428
I'll switch you over.

600
00:59:24,721 --> 00:59:26,848
Tess, it's me.

601
00:59:30,685 --> 00:59:33,521
I couldn't find the red shoes...

602
00:59:35,523 --> 00:59:38,818
Tess McGill's office. Who's calling?

603
00:59:39,486 --> 00:59:41,780
One moment, please.

604
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,241
Jack.

605
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:48,203
It went well in Memphis. Yeah...

606
00:59:48,286 --> 00:59:52,499
Really well, I think. But we're gonna
have to move fast and hit 'em high.

607
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:57,587
Armbrister thinks that Metro is family,
and you know how that can be.

608
00:59:57,712 --> 01:00:02,592
He's willing to listen,
but you gotta get Trask to talk sweet.

609
01:00:02,675 --> 01:00:05,345
He's thinking about 70 mil.

610
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:08,765
I've been up here all night,
working the numbers.

611
01:00:08,848 --> 01:00:11,726
I'd like to go over it with you.
Can we meet for lunch?

612
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,647
Lunch is all right, isn't it?
Daylight, a lot of people around.

613
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,693
There's that real romantic souvlaki stand,
out in front of your place.

614
01:00:20,777 --> 01:00:23,696
You're in no particular danger, I think.

615
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:30,328
Yeah. Meet you there around one.

616
01:00:30,662 --> 01:00:33,540
OK, I'll see you then. Bye.

617
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:38,711
Mick's really raw.

618
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:42,632
He says he's gonna throw
the rest of your stuff out.

619
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,095
He kept me there talkin' at me
till five this morning.

620
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:49,681
Oh, God, Cyn. I'm sorry.

621
01:00:52,225 --> 01:00:56,020
- How hard would it be to crash a wedding?
- What are you talkin' about?

622
01:00:56,104 --> 01:01:00,942
Oren Trask's daughter is getting married
tomorrow. The reception is at the Union Club.

623
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:04,571
So I figure I blend in. I get to Trask.

624
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:07,449
I mean, how hard could that be?

625
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:11,494
The wedding party's not gonna admit
that they've never seen you before.

626
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:13,788
Nobody knows everybody at those things.

627
01:01:13,872 --> 01:01:16,708
- Tess... Wait a minute.
- All I need is five minutes with Trask.

628
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,335
Tess, I'm talkin' to you.

629
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:21,129
What?

630
01:01:21,254 --> 01:01:23,381
First of all, look me in the eye

631
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:27,135
and tell me you're not thinking,
even in your wildest dreams,

632
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,640
Mr Briefcase "Let's have lunch" there
is gonna take you away from all of this.

633
01:01:32,724 --> 01:01:35,310
We're doing a deal together, that's all.

634
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:39,731
Cos you know you'll get your heart stomped,
just like you're stompin' Mick's.

635
01:01:39,814 --> 01:01:44,110
Hey, it wasn't me poppin'
Doreen DiMucci in our bed, OK?

636
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:48,031
- How come you're all on his side?
- I'm not.

637
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:53,578
But you're not even giving him the chance
to make it up to you, and that's not like you.

638
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:59,083
Look, if you're so smart, why don't you act
smart and save your ass while you still can?

639
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:03,588
Else they're gonna find out,
you're not gonna have your job, or any job.

640
01:02:03,671 --> 01:02:05,757
You lost your man and your home already.

641
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:11,304
I'm gonna come clean as soon as
I get my end set up. I swear.

642
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:14,682
- I know what I'm doing.
- So do I. Screwin' up your life.

643
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:16,976
No, I'm trying to make it better.

644
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:20,980
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
working my ass off and getting nowhere

645
01:02:21,106 --> 01:02:25,735
just because I followed rules that
I had nothing to do with setting up, OK?

646
01:02:29,572 --> 01:02:31,741
Tess McGill's office.

647
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:33,952
Katharine... No.

648
01:02:34,035 --> 01:02:36,621
Of course it's still your office. I was just...

649
01:02:36,704 --> 01:02:39,207
I'll see you, Tess.

650
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,086
Cyn.

651
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:49,467
Sometimes I sing and dance
around the house in my underwear.

652
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:52,971
Doesn't make me Madonna. Never will.

653
01:02:55,515 --> 01:02:58,852
- Are you there?
- Yes, Katharine.

654
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:03,356
Don't get too used to those long lunches.
I'm coming back a week from today.

655
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,818
A week from today?
Isn't that faster than you thought?

656
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:09,779
Well, the doctor says I've got great bones.

657
01:03:09,863 --> 01:03:13,950
Of course, his aren't too bad either.

658
01:03:14,033 --> 01:03:17,662
Anyway, I need you to summarise
the Baron Oil prospectus...

659
01:03:17,745 --> 01:03:19,122
Hi, Schatz.

660
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:23,293
And send that to me along with
the last two quarterly reports.

661
01:03:23,418 --> 01:03:26,796
- You are a sport.
- Yes, I'm a sport.

662
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,843
OK. Bye.

663
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:38,433
So what kind of figures
have you been throwing at 'em?

664
01:03:38,516 --> 01:03:40,894
Well, no exact figures yet.

665
01:03:40,977 --> 01:03:43,438
What's their ballpark?

666
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:48,526
I want to get them excited about the concept
before I start throwing actual figures at them.

667
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:52,113
- Are they excited?
- They're going to be.

668
01:03:53,823 --> 01:03:55,575
Wait a minute.

669
01:03:55,658 --> 01:03:58,787
I've been working on this thing
for 36 hours straight.

670
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,916
I got a progress meeting with
the head of my department at 2 o'clock.

671
01:04:02,999 --> 01:04:06,586
- Where the hell exactly are we?
- Don't yell at me.

672
01:04:06,669 --> 01:04:09,214
Answer me.

673
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:13,343
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna see
Trask himself tomorrow.

674
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:16,471
I feel that we're strong enough
to go right to him.

675
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:19,432
Where are we meeting him? What time?

676
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:22,227
He's not expecting both of us.

677
01:04:24,896 --> 01:04:27,565
Are you trying to fly this thing without me?

678
01:04:27,649 --> 01:04:32,403
- No. I wouldn't do that.
- You go and set up this meeting without me.

679
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:35,907
What the hell kind of a way
to do business is this?

680
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:39,661
- Would you calm down?
- How am I supposed to calm down?

681
01:04:39,786 --> 01:04:42,747
One lost deal is all it takes
to get canned these days.

682
01:04:42,872 --> 01:04:47,085
The line buttons on my phone all have
an inch of little pieces of tape piled on.

683
01:04:47,168 --> 01:04:49,421
The names of new guys over old guys.

684
01:04:49,504 --> 01:04:55,135
Good men who aren't at the other end of
the line any more, all cos of one lost deal.

685
01:04:57,178 --> 01:05:00,473
I don't wanna get buried
under a little piece of tape.

686
01:05:00,557 --> 01:05:03,101
No one's trying to bury you
under a little piece of tape.

687
01:05:03,226 --> 01:05:05,895
OK, so I've been in a little bit of a slump.

688
01:05:05,979 --> 01:05:10,275
I'm not afraid to admit it. Give me
a break here. Don't go leading me on.

689
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,903
If you got some doubts about me,
say 'em to my face. Give me that much.

690
01:05:13,987 --> 01:05:16,322
I don't have any doubts about you.

691
01:05:18,241 --> 01:05:20,285
OK.

692
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:23,413
You need me, you know.

693
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:27,750
- I mean any doubts about your ability.
- You need me at that meeting.

694
01:05:30,837 --> 01:05:33,506
Is he jet-lagged from somewhere,
or he just lunches late?

695
01:05:34,215 --> 01:05:35,925
Three o'clock's a late lunch.

696
01:05:36,009 --> 01:05:39,971
Well, it's not exactly lunch,
but there will be food there though.

697
01:05:40,054 --> 01:05:44,809
- What's the story, Tess?
- It's his daughter's wedding.

698
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:47,395
- That's the meeting?
- It's the perfect opportunity.

699
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:51,566
He's happy, he's had a little champagne.
We look for an opening. Trust me.

700
01:05:51,649 --> 01:05:54,611
What are we supposed to do?
Jump out of the wedding cake?

701
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:57,197
Don't be silly.

702
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,056
Welcome to our party. Come in.

703
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,022
Hello. Nice to see you.
Do you know which table you're at?

704
01:06:31,689 --> 01:06:34,192
- No...
- Yes. I do, darling.

705
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:37,278
I see Phyllis. Come on.

706
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:46,996
Glad you could make it.
Oren and Barbara Trask.

707
01:06:47,497 --> 01:06:50,208
- Tess McGill. What a great idea.
- Jack Trainer.

708
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:54,421
- It's so nice to see you again.
- Well, the kids thought it would be fun.

709
01:06:54,504 --> 01:06:58,633
- You must be friends of Mark's.
- Well, let's get you over there.

710
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:03,471
Actually, I should go powder my bathroom...
nose. Darling, will you wait here?

711
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:06,307
It's so nice... See you later.

712
01:07:06,558 --> 01:07:09,185
I think I'll get a drink.

713
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:10,103
Bunny.

714
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:23,575
Isn't he gorgeous?

715
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:37,881
Get a grip. Get a grip, Tess. Get a grip.

716
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:51,394
We're not even invited to this thing, are we?

717
01:07:51,478 --> 01:07:56,232
OK, so we're not exactly invited. But he's here
and we're here. So that makes us...

718
01:07:56,357 --> 01:08:00,069
- Total idiots.
-..in the right place at the right time.

719
01:08:00,153 --> 01:08:02,489
You're like one of those crazed cops.

720
01:08:02,572 --> 01:08:07,368
The kind nobody wants to ride with,
whose partners all end up dead or crazy.

721
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:10,371
Just act like you belong.

722
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:21,341
Do you love it or do you hate it?

723
01:08:21,925 --> 01:08:24,552
- Love it.
- So do I.

724
01:08:24,636 --> 01:08:29,390
But Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and
that we're making some kind of statement.

725
01:08:29,474 --> 01:08:32,560
Oh, no. It's just like paradise.

726
01:08:33,144 --> 01:08:36,523
It's like a paradise with little gold palm trees.

727
01:08:38,191 --> 01:08:40,693
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

728
01:08:43,863 --> 01:08:47,617
I hope I'm not being rude, but who are you?

729
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:52,580
I'm Tess. I'm... I'm a friend of Mark's.

730
01:08:54,124 --> 01:08:58,086
I'm just so happy that
I could be here for you today.

731
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,590
Glorious. Fabulous. Stunning, really.

732
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:05,635
Super. Elegant. Perfect.

733
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:29,993
You're right. This is crazy, so let's just go.

734
01:09:32,787 --> 01:09:33,997
Excuse me.

735
01:09:34,122 --> 01:09:37,208
The woman that's dancing with Oren -
what's her name?

736
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:40,253
- Elizabeth Stubblefield?
- That's right.

737
01:09:41,296 --> 01:09:44,549
- Liz? Beth?
- Bitsy.

738
01:09:44,632 --> 01:09:46,718
Bitsy. That's right.

739
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:49,095
Jack...

740
01:09:49,179 --> 01:09:51,681
You wanna do it, do it.

741
01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:58,271
Excuse us. Bitsy, don't break my heart
and tell me you don't remember me.

742
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:02,275
- Of course I do.
- Excuse us.

743
01:10:06,654 --> 01:10:09,115
Talk about a small world, huh?

744
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:14,704
I mean, here we've just met and yet I feel
I've spent so much time working with you.

745
01:10:14,746 --> 01:10:18,166
In a way. I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions
at Petty Marsh.

746
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,836
I really wish we were having more luck
with your team.

747
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:24,506
So do I. So do I.

748
01:10:24,589 --> 01:10:27,509
I've been trying to set you up
with a radio network,

749
01:10:27,592 --> 01:10:31,846
but my bosses think you're stuck on
acquiring television and won't even listen.

750
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:35,016
- Well, that's not true.
- That's what I said.

751
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,228
I said that the man who in 1971
looked into the future

752
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:41,189
and saw that it was named
microwave technology,

753
01:10:41,314 --> 01:10:46,736
the man who applied Japanese management
principles while others kowtowed to the unions,

754
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:50,448
the man who saw the Ma Bell break-up
coming from miles away,

755
01:10:50,532 --> 01:10:54,410
this man did not get to be
this man - you, I mean -

756
01:10:54,536 --> 01:10:59,082
by shutting himself off to new ideas.
Am I right or am I right?

757
01:10:59,165 --> 01:11:01,876
- I think you're right.
- Damn straight I'm right.

758
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,170
If you've got the right property, I'd love to hear.

759
01:11:04,254 --> 01:11:06,464
- You would?
- Well, absolutely.

760
01:11:06,548 --> 01:11:08,591
- What looks good now?
- There she is.

761
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:13,179
I just realised that I...
I'm hogging the father of the bride.

762
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:17,600
And I see Phyllis coming... What do you say
that I give you a call on Monday?

763
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:22,355
- Our media consultant is Tim Draper.
- Tim. Right.

764
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:25,233
- Honey, I'm starved.
- So am I.

765
01:11:25,316 --> 01:11:27,527
- Bye.
- Bye.

766
01:11:29,737 --> 01:11:33,741
Go ahead and laugh. He wants us to meet
with his people first thing Monday.

767
01:11:33,825 --> 01:11:37,620
Oren Trask? The man who said "What if
we sliced the bread before we sold it?"

768
01:11:37,704 --> 01:11:39,164
All right...

769
01:11:39,247 --> 01:11:43,668
No, no, no. I loved it.
I had fun. And you were amazing.

770
01:11:44,419 --> 01:11:46,921
- You think so?
- Amazing.

771
01:11:52,427 --> 01:11:58,808
The Fort Worth station - projected revenues
should read up 8%, not 6%.

772
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:06,566
And where it says the FCC ruling on
Metro's Memphis transmitter is pending,

773
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:09,986
that's outdated. FCC approved it Friday.

774
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,323
Doubles the signal reach.

775
01:12:13,865 --> 01:12:16,409
Ups the station's value by 30%.

776
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:27,337
And now back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

777
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:39,641
I guess we're ready.

778
01:12:44,813 --> 01:12:47,982
- Trainer and McGill.
- Yes. Top of the stairs.

779
01:13:04,124 --> 01:13:06,543
Are we waiting for Mr Trask?

780
01:13:06,626 --> 01:13:09,462
Mr Trask doesn't sit in at this level.

781
01:13:10,338 --> 01:13:13,299
Of course he doesn't.

782
01:13:13,383 --> 01:13:18,304
Here's the way we see it. Trask Industries
has two important needs to meet at this time.

783
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:23,601
By acquiring Metro Radio Network,
you nail two birds with one stone...

784
01:13:23,685 --> 01:13:27,856
Excuse me. Do you have any
other proposals besides Metro?

785
01:13:29,065 --> 01:13:32,068
- No. Why?
- Metro's a terrific opportunity.

786
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:37,866
I'm sure it is, but a Chicago group
just put a bear hug on Metro this morning

787
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:40,743
and the company's in play.

788
01:13:40,827 --> 01:13:43,413
- Just this morning?
- Who?

789
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:46,249
The Slade brothers.

790
01:13:46,332 --> 01:13:48,376
Trask isn't aiming at radio anyway.

791
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:52,380
We certainly don't want
to get into a bidding war.

792
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:54,841
A moment, please.

793
01:13:54,924 --> 01:13:59,763
Armbrister looks at Metro as if it were part
of his family. He cares who he's selling to.

794
01:13:59,888 --> 01:14:03,016
Yes. And he holds the majority of the stock.

795
01:14:05,393 --> 01:14:10,064
Look. If the Slades are uninvited,
and I'm sure they are,

796
01:14:10,148 --> 01:14:14,944
and Armbrister and Trask can agree
on a deal, then we won't have a war.

797
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:18,364
If I get Armbrister up here,
will Trask take the meeting?

798
01:14:18,448 --> 01:14:21,409
A lot of ifs. We really
don't want to get involved.

799
01:14:21,618 --> 01:14:25,163
- 24 hours.
- Sorry. Not interested.

800
01:14:33,588 --> 01:14:35,965
Yes, sir.

801
01:14:37,258 --> 01:14:39,552
All right, sir.

802
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:46,768
Yes, he'll take the meeting.

803
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:50,688
- That was Mr Trask?
- Yes, it was.

804
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:54,776
How did he know?

805
01:14:54,901 --> 01:14:56,903
He knows everything.

806
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:34,793
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

807
01:17:06,324 --> 01:17:08,827
How'd you get this scar?

808
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:13,498
Some guy pulled a knife in Detroit.

809
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:16,751
Really?

810
01:17:18,378 --> 01:17:20,463
No. No.

811
01:17:21,297 --> 01:17:24,175
I was 19 and I thought
it'd be cool to have a pierced ear.

812
01:17:24,259 --> 01:17:29,264
My girlfriend stuck the needle through
and I fainted and hit my chin on the toilet.

813
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:36,855
Have you been telling that story ever since?

814
01:17:36,938 --> 01:17:40,525
You're the only one
who knows the true story.

815
01:17:41,985 --> 01:17:44,487
Except the girlfriend.

816
01:17:46,197 --> 01:17:49,033
I had her disappear.

817
01:17:50,326 --> 01:17:54,873
It's too bad. Nice girl. Real shame.

818
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:09,304
Jack, there's something that I have to tell you.

819
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:22,025
Hello.

820
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:24,819
Hi.

821
01:18:30,366 --> 01:18:32,494
I know. No...

822
01:18:32,619 --> 01:18:35,038
Can't wait.

823
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,795
Yeah, OK. Well, call me when you get in.

824
01:18:43,922 --> 01:18:45,965
OK.

825
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:50,261
Me too.

826
01:18:50,345 --> 01:18:52,639
OK. Bye.

827
01:18:53,223 --> 01:18:55,308
Bye.

828
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:14,369
OK... There's this woman.

829
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:16,830
It's over.

830
01:19:16,913 --> 01:19:21,918
But technically it's not. I just haven't
had a chance to break it off yet.

831
01:19:22,001 --> 01:19:24,754
It's OK. You don't have to explain.

832
01:19:24,838 --> 01:19:29,551
No, really. We were supposed to go away
together a couple of weeks ago

833
01:19:29,676 --> 01:19:31,803
and I was gonna tell her then.

834
01:19:31,886 --> 01:19:34,764
But I had to work through the weekend
and never got there.

835
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:38,643
It's just a... a timing thing.

836
01:19:39,102 --> 01:19:41,855
It's just she broke her leg skiing
and was laid up

837
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:46,443
and I couldn't see doing it
over the phone, you know.

838
01:19:46,526 --> 01:19:49,362
Kicking somebody when they're down.

839
01:19:52,449 --> 01:19:56,119
I wouldn't mention it, except
she's in your department at Petty.

840
01:19:56,244 --> 01:20:00,665
- You mentioned her the first time you called.
- Katharine.

841
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,377
Parker. Yeah.

842
01:20:06,838 --> 01:20:09,549
Now what did you wanna tell me?

843
01:20:12,594 --> 01:20:14,679
It's not important.

844
01:20:16,222 --> 01:20:18,308
120, even.

845
01:20:30,945 --> 01:20:33,615
Miss. Miss, you forget your book.

846
01:21:19,911 --> 01:21:22,414
Tess. It's me. I'm back.

847
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:24,999
Thanks.

848
01:21:28,336 --> 01:21:30,547
She took a muscle relaxant for the flight down.

849
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,383
- Let's all have one, shall we?
- I don't think so.

850
01:21:33,466 --> 01:21:35,510
Telephone. I need a telephone.

851
01:21:35,593 --> 01:21:38,638
Tess, take care of the bags.
I'll meet you at the car.

852
01:21:41,349 --> 01:21:43,435
I love these pills.

853
01:21:43,935 --> 01:21:46,855
Just for a minute, Jack. Please?

854
01:21:47,814 --> 01:21:49,899
I must see you, darling.

855
01:21:50,483 --> 01:21:54,154
My apartment in one hour
and I won't take no for an answer.

856
01:21:54,237 --> 01:21:56,614
No, I won't take no for an answer.

857
01:21:58,908 --> 01:22:01,536
Oh, I'm home. I'm home, I'm home.

858
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:06,040
Oh, God...

859
01:22:11,588 --> 01:22:14,257
- Did you happen to see this?
- What is it?

860
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:18,136
It's an outline of your idea
for a Trask radio acquisition.

861
01:22:18,219 --> 01:22:23,600
I was planning to send it over to Jack Trainer.
I thought I'd give your idea one last go-round.

862
01:22:23,683 --> 01:22:28,605
It just occurs to me, looking at it,
that it reads as though it were my idea.

863
01:22:28,688 --> 01:22:33,860
Jack got burned once. He was accused of
stealing a plan for taking a company private.

864
01:22:33,985 --> 01:22:38,323
He's very sticky about the ethics of
reviewing other people's strategies.

865
01:22:38,406 --> 01:22:43,620
He wouldn't do it if it was from a colleague,
and I couldn't say it was a secretary's notion.

866
01:22:43,703 --> 01:22:48,041
Anyway, the point is, Tess,
that I'm still trying to get you heard.

867
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:54,339
What am I saying? If you had seen it,
you simply would have asked me about it.

868
01:22:55,131 --> 01:22:57,383
Trust.

869
01:22:59,886 --> 01:23:02,472
I'll need help bathing and changing.

870
01:23:05,475 --> 01:23:08,269
I need something to cover this cast.

871
01:23:08,895 --> 01:23:11,189
There's an afghan on the chair.

872
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:17,028
- Perfect.
- If that'll be all...

873
01:23:17,112 --> 01:23:21,407
And some perfume.
Shalimar, on the dresser.

874
01:23:23,743 --> 01:23:26,246
He loves Shalimar.

875
01:23:27,747 --> 01:23:30,125
- He, who?
- Jack Trainer, who.

876
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,585
He's on his way over.

877
01:23:32,669 --> 01:23:35,380
I have to go. Doctor's appointment.

878
01:23:35,463 --> 01:23:39,217
One last thing? Run down
to the drugstore and get me my pills?

879
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,762
- I really have to go.
- The doctor will understand.

880
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:46,516
Thanks.

881
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:14,043
- Who is it?
- Jack.

882
01:24:23,887 --> 01:24:26,389
- Katharine?
- In the bedroom.

883
01:24:31,895 --> 01:24:33,438
Jack.

884
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:35,607
Katharine.

885
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:39,152
Boy, did I ever miss you.

886
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:43,156
- Does it hurt?
- Look at you.

887
01:24:43,281 --> 01:24:47,619
- You said it was urgent, Kath.
- I'd forgotten how damn handsome you are.

888
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:50,663
Thanks. Look...

889
01:24:50,747 --> 01:24:53,124
I meant what I said. I really am swamped...

890
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:56,836
Boy, some welcome home.
I haven't even gotten a kiss.

891
01:25:04,385 --> 01:25:08,681
There's some champagne in the little fridge.
You wanna get it for us?

892
01:25:08,765 --> 01:25:12,644
Sure. And then, I really do have to go.

893
01:25:29,536 --> 01:25:32,747
- Where are the glasses?
- Try the dishwasher.

894
01:25:43,341 --> 01:25:45,844
Here you are.

895
01:25:51,015 --> 01:25:53,977
You know I love you, Jack. You know that.

896
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:57,730
Katharine, I really do have to get going.

897
01:25:57,814 --> 01:26:03,153
These past few weeks, I've heard this
funny little sound, way deep down inside.

898
01:26:03,778 --> 01:26:06,698
Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

899
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:11,870
- My biological clock.
- Big deal going. Principals are all meeting...

900
01:26:11,995 --> 01:26:15,707
And I've been thinking "Let's merge."

901
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:18,168
You and I.

902
01:26:18,251 --> 01:26:22,046
Think of it, darling.
Mr and Mrs Fabulously Happy.

903
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:27,677
Katharine, it's really not a good time to talk.

904
01:26:28,845 --> 01:26:30,930
You're right.

905
01:26:31,556 --> 01:26:34,100
Can Big Jack come out to play?

906
01:26:34,225 --> 01:26:38,646
- Little Jack really has to get going.
- Little Katie's been so lonely...

907
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:41,149
No. No. No.

908
01:26:41,232 --> 01:26:43,276
Jack. What is it?

909
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,406
There's something I have to tell you.
There's someone else and I...

910
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:50,992
There's someone else?

911
01:26:51,826 --> 01:26:55,371
Someone else that I have to be meeting
right now. Big deal going.

912
01:26:55,455 --> 01:26:58,333
Can't be in two places at the same time.

913
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,752
Talk to you later. Bye.

914
01:27:15,433 --> 01:27:17,519
Here we are.

915
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:26,778
OK, I've gotta run. Sorry. Bye.

916
01:27:35,036 --> 01:27:39,624
Tess, you forgot your notebook.

917
01:27:59,978 --> 01:28:02,730
That little slut.

918
01:28:03,523 --> 01:28:06,568
Goddamn little bitch secretary.

919
01:28:09,863 --> 01:28:11,990
Hi. I have a meeting with Mr Trask.

920
01:28:12,073 --> 01:28:14,159
- Your name, please?
- Tess McGill.

921
01:28:14,242 --> 01:28:16,786
All right. It's at the top of the stairs.

922
01:28:26,796 --> 01:28:28,339
Miss McGill.

923
01:28:28,423 --> 01:28:30,925
Good afternoon. Let me take your coat.

924
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:35,221
- Thank you.
- This way, please.

925
01:28:37,682 --> 01:28:39,768
Thank you.

926
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:51,946
- Hi.
- Hi. Is everything OK?

927
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:56,659
Yeah, yeah. You're the only one
from Petty here so far. What's going on?

928
01:28:56,743 --> 01:28:59,704
- Flying solo on this.
- Good.

929
01:29:00,914 --> 01:29:03,625
Old Armbrister and Trask are over there.

930
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:07,003
We're waiting to see what colour smoke
comes out of the chimney.

931
01:29:07,128 --> 01:29:11,633
Tell me something. If a colleague of mine
had a strategy they needed help with,

932
01:29:11,716 --> 01:29:15,470
- would you look at it if I asked you to?
- Yeah, sure.

933
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,266
No ethics problem? You know,
open to accusations about stealing?

934
01:29:20,391 --> 01:29:23,895
I look at stuff all the time.
Nobody's ever accused me of stealing.

935
01:29:23,978 --> 01:29:26,606
What's it about?

936
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:32,278
I don't know. I'm so nervous,
I can't stand still.

937
01:29:34,489 --> 01:29:36,991
You'll be fine.

938
01:29:40,412 --> 01:29:42,914
I love you.

939
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:47,544
I love you too.

940
01:29:49,421 --> 01:29:52,048
Gentlemen?

941
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,403
There was a story on the news last night

942
01:30:13,486 --> 01:30:16,906
showing life imitating
an old children's riddle.

943
01:30:17,866 --> 01:30:23,538
A truck got stuck at the entrance to the
Holland Tunnel. Too high for the clearance.

944
01:30:23,621 --> 01:30:29,502
For hours, the experts tried to find some way
to unwedge the vehicle, but to no avail.

945
01:30:30,378 --> 01:30:34,007
Finally, a 10-year-old girl in a passing car

946
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:38,845
suggested simply letting
the air out of the truck's tyres,

947
01:30:38,928 --> 01:30:43,224
thus lowering it to the clearance level,
which they did.

948
01:30:43,308 --> 01:30:45,769
And it worked.

949
01:30:47,061 --> 01:30:52,192
Well, by letting some of the air out of
our strategy to expand into broadcasting,

950
01:30:52,275 --> 01:30:57,655
Miss McGill and Mr Trainer have effectively
shown all of us here at Trask

951
01:30:57,739 --> 01:31:00,450
the light at the end of our tunnel.

952
01:31:05,914 --> 01:31:08,041
Gentlemen and ladies.

953
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,587
I've decided to sell Mr Trask
the Metro Radio System

954
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,466
for $68.5 million in cash and securities.

955
01:31:16,549 --> 01:31:19,761
Now, of course, this is
an agreement in principle.

956
01:31:19,844 --> 01:31:24,516
As to what constitutes principles
in this day and age,

957
01:31:24,641 --> 01:31:28,978
I'm gonna leave that
up to you barracudas to squabble over.

958
01:31:29,062 --> 01:31:31,731
I'm certain they'll want to hear this.

959
01:31:33,358 --> 01:31:36,236
Miss, this is a closed meeting and you can't...

960
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:37,862
Thank God I'm here.

961
01:31:37,946 --> 01:31:41,282
- What the hell is going on?
- You're being tricked. That's what's going on.

962
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:45,495
- Katharine, what...
- Jack, just trust me and sit down.

963
01:31:46,371 --> 01:31:51,042
I'm Katharine Parker. I'm an associate partner
in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty Marsh.

964
01:31:51,126 --> 01:31:53,837
And this woman is my secretary.

965
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:58,716
- She's not.
- Oh, no? Ask her.

966
01:31:59,008 --> 01:32:03,138
- You're not her secretary.
- I can explain, Jack.

967
01:32:04,597 --> 01:32:07,058
Oh, Jesus. You are her secretary.

968
01:32:07,559 --> 01:32:09,811
While I was laid up with broken bones,

969
01:32:09,894 --> 01:32:14,357
she rifled through my desk, found my memo
outlining a Trask radio acquisition

970
01:32:14,482 --> 01:32:16,860
and has been passing it off as her idea.

971
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:21,072
It was my idea. She stole it from me, I swear.

972
01:32:21,156 --> 01:32:24,409
Good God, Tess.
Don't you know when to stop?

973
01:32:24,659 --> 01:32:27,162
But you're lying.

974
01:32:36,755 --> 01:32:38,798
Thank you.

975
01:32:39,758 --> 01:32:42,010
Thank you.

976
01:32:47,223 --> 01:32:49,309
Thank you all so much.

977
01:32:50,852 --> 01:32:55,356
The upside is that I have found out
in time to control the damage.

978
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,277
We have containment
and we have a deal on the table.

979
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:04,449
I say pass me a set of papers
and let's get on with it.

980
01:33:06,034 --> 01:33:08,661
Who's running this thing?

981
01:33:08,745 --> 01:33:11,039
Just a second, please.

982
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:16,169
I know you don't believe me, but...

983
01:33:17,754 --> 01:33:20,590
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry.

984
01:33:21,591 --> 01:33:23,301
I'm sorry.

985
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:25,845
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

986
01:33:49,828 --> 01:33:51,913
Well, gentlemen.

987
01:33:52,997 --> 01:33:55,875
The players may have changed,
but the game remains the same.

988
01:33:55,959 --> 01:33:58,878
The name of the game is "Let's make a deal".

989
01:33:59,838 --> 01:34:05,802
If you all turn to page 22 in your prospectus,
I'll take you through the terms of transferral.

990
01:35:35,475 --> 01:35:37,977
Well, they did it.

991
01:35:38,061 --> 01:35:40,605
Yeah. They sure did.

992
01:35:41,856 --> 01:35:44,359
You really look great.

993
01:35:45,401 --> 01:35:48,404
- How are you?
- Good, good.

994
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:52,659
- Business is great and...
- Mick, did you see me?

995
01:35:52,742 --> 01:35:55,203
I caught it one-handed.

996
01:35:56,454 --> 01:35:59,290
- Hi.
- Hey, Doreen.

997
01:36:01,876 --> 01:36:07,715
And my boat's booked through three weeks
from now. Doreen's workin' the lines for me.

998
01:36:07,799 --> 01:36:10,260
That's great. Really.

999
01:36:12,053 --> 01:36:14,514
So how's life in the fast lane?

1000
01:36:15,223 --> 01:36:17,892
Well, it's fast.

1001
01:36:18,726 --> 01:36:21,020
It's real fast and busy and...

1002
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:26,192
It's good to see you, Mick.
I guess I'd better get.

1003
01:36:27,068 --> 01:36:29,779
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

1004
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:18,036
Cyn told us about what happened.
It really bites the big one, Tess. Really.

1005
01:37:18,745 --> 01:37:21,706
- We took up a little collection.
- Thanks.

1006
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:27,587
It's not much. Just enough to go out and get
toasted some night when you really need it.

1007
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:30,381
Don't say no. We really wanted to.

1008
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:33,134
And no paying the Con Ed with it.

1009
01:37:34,344 --> 01:37:36,429
OK. Thanks.

1010
01:37:36,971 --> 01:37:39,682
So what are you gonna do now, huh?

1011
01:37:39,766 --> 01:37:44,020
You know... Play some golf,
redecorate the country house.

1012
01:37:46,106 --> 01:37:50,944
I don't know. Start all over.
Find a job, a place to live.

1013
01:37:52,028 --> 01:37:56,366
And just wise up and not take
the whole thing so seriously.

1014
01:37:56,449 --> 01:37:58,493
I'll be OK.

1015
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:05,959
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

1016
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:08,128
- Thank you.
- Miss you.

1017
01:38:09,462 --> 01:38:11,714
- Good luck.
- Bye, Tess.

1018
01:38:12,799 --> 01:38:15,176
- Don't work too hard.
- Bye, Tess.

1019
01:38:27,564 --> 01:38:29,649
Sorry.

1020
01:38:36,364 --> 01:38:40,243
- I've been trying to find you.
- Just leave me alone.

1021
01:38:40,326 --> 01:38:45,331
Just one thing. Was you and me
just part of the scheme too?

1022
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,083
No.

1023
01:38:47,167 --> 01:38:51,379
If I'd told you I was just some secretary,
you never would've taken the meeting.

1024
01:38:51,463 --> 01:38:52,881
Think about it.

1025
01:38:52,964 --> 01:38:57,010
Maybe you'd have fed me a few drinks and
tried to get me into the sack. End of story.

1026
01:38:57,093 --> 01:38:59,637
- That's not true.
- Are you sure about that?

1027
01:38:59,763 --> 01:39:04,768
Can you honestly tell me it wouldn't have
made a difference? Who's fooling who here?

1028
01:39:04,893 --> 01:39:07,729
What's this? More stolen files?

1029
01:39:08,563 --> 01:39:10,774
No, it's my stuff from the desk.

1030
01:39:10,899 --> 01:39:14,944
- Your stuff? Now there's a broad term.
- No, it's my stuff.

1031
01:39:15,069 --> 01:39:18,073
Maybe you can fool these guys
with this saint act,

1032
01:39:18,156 --> 01:39:22,452
but do not ever speak to me again
like we don't know what really happened.

1033
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:27,457
Tess, this is business.
Let's just bury the hatchet, OK?

1034
01:39:27,832 --> 01:39:32,587
You know where you can bury your hatchet?
Now get your bony ass out of my sight.

1035
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:38,009
And if you really think that I said I loved you
as part of some scheme, then that is pathetic.

1036
01:39:38,093 --> 01:39:42,097
- My God. She'll stop at nothing.
- What kind of show are you people running?

1037
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:46,392
Oren, I'm sorry you've had to see this,
but it means nothing to us.

1038
01:39:48,186 --> 01:39:50,480
Jack, let's get upstairs.

1039
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:53,733
- Not without her.
- Jack.

1040
01:39:53,817 --> 01:39:56,569
Trainer, are you trying to blow this deal?

1041
01:39:57,237 --> 01:40:00,448
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure
that it gets done right.

1042
01:40:00,532 --> 01:40:04,619
Tess put this deal together.
We shouldn't proceed without her.

1043
01:40:04,702 --> 01:40:09,290
And you shouldn't go letting your johnson
make business decisions for you.

1044
01:40:09,374 --> 01:40:12,460
I'm not, sir. I'm telling you, she's your man.

1045
01:40:12,544 --> 01:40:16,297
- What brings you to that conclusion?
- She said so and I believe her.

1046
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:20,343
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Now, are you with us or not?

1047
01:40:23,138 --> 01:40:25,557
No.

1048
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:29,436
Jack, I forgive you. Now get on this elevator.

1049
01:40:31,062 --> 01:40:34,357
- Sorry, Katharine.
- You will be sorry, Jack.

1050
01:40:37,652 --> 01:40:40,613
Ask her to tell you about
the hole in your deal.

1051
01:40:41,823 --> 01:40:44,701
- What hole?
- She's playing games. Let's get going.

1052
01:40:44,784 --> 01:40:47,287
- Fine. Go.
- No. What hole?

1053
01:40:47,495 --> 01:40:49,539
Look.

1054
01:40:50,248 --> 01:40:53,960
The People Page? Now, this is ridiculous.

1055
01:40:54,043 --> 01:40:57,297
"Former Miss America Dawn Bixby
has been house-hunting."

1056
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:01,092
"Seems Dawn and hot, hot, hot
DJ hubby Slim Slicker

1057
01:41:01,176 --> 01:41:04,262
are getting ready to take
a bite out of the Big Apple."

1058
01:41:04,345 --> 01:41:08,725
- So?
- Slim Slicker's one of Metro's major assets.

1059
01:41:08,808 --> 01:41:13,188
Syndicated to all their stations.
The cornerstone of their programming.

1060
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:16,483
Lose him and Metro's just
real estate with falling ratings.

1061
01:41:16,566 --> 01:41:18,860
And you're not buying it for a write-off.

1062
01:41:18,943 --> 01:41:21,362
Better make sure he's locked in
before they sign.

1063
01:41:21,446 --> 01:41:24,741
Oren, I have this covered. Upstairs. Shall we?

1064
01:41:24,824 --> 01:41:26,785
- Yes.
- Yes.

1065
01:41:26,868 --> 01:41:30,205
Hear the lady out, sir.
There's another elevator.

1066
01:41:37,712 --> 01:41:39,798
You're on.

1067
01:41:43,593 --> 01:41:44,969
OK.

1068
01:41:45,053 --> 01:41:51,101
This is Forbes. It's the basic article about how
you were looking to get into broadcasting.

1069
01:41:51,184 --> 01:41:56,439
OK, the same day, I'm reading the Post
and there's this item on Bobby Stein,

1070
01:41:56,523 --> 01:42:01,111
the radio guy who does those gross jokes
about Ethiopia and the Betty Ford Center.

1071
01:42:01,194 --> 01:42:05,824
Anyway, he's hosting this charity auction -
real blue bloods, and won't that be funny?

1072
01:42:05,949 --> 01:42:09,994
Now I turn the page to the society stuff
and there's a picture of your daughter.

1073
01:42:10,161 --> 01:42:13,748
Nice picture. And she's helping
to organise the charity ball.

1074
01:42:13,832 --> 01:42:18,128
So I started to think Trask, radio. Trask, radio.

1075
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:22,549
And then I hooked up with Jack,
and he came on board with Metro,

1076
01:42:22,632 --> 01:42:25,927
and... and so now here we are.

1077
01:42:39,065 --> 01:42:42,402
Oren, we really don't have
any more time for fairy tales.

1078
01:42:42,485 --> 01:42:45,780
Miss Parker, let me ask you a question.

1079
01:42:45,864 --> 01:42:49,784
How did you come up the idea
for Trask to buy up Metro?

1080
01:42:49,909 --> 01:42:52,203
How did I...?

1081
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:55,832
Well, let's see. The...

1082
01:42:57,083 --> 01:43:00,587
The impulse. What led you
to put the two together?

1083
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:07,135
Well, I would have to check my files.
I can't recall exactly the...

1084
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:10,722
Generally. It's not as if
it was in the mainstream.

1085
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:15,101
You know, it would have to be the...

1086
01:43:17,979 --> 01:43:20,732
Jack, help me out here.

1087
01:43:25,153 --> 01:43:28,907
Oren, I beg your pardon,
but if you are insinuating...

1088
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:34,579
Miss Parker, if I were you, I'd go to your office
and take a long last look around.

1089
01:43:35,163 --> 01:43:40,668
Because in about five minutes, I'm going
to see to it that you get the boot but good.

1090
01:43:41,377 --> 01:43:45,006
Oren, this is a simple misunderstanding.
I... You cannot...

1091
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:47,300
I can and I will.

1092
01:43:47,383 --> 01:43:50,178
Now get your... What did you call it?

1093
01:43:50,845 --> 01:43:53,556
- Bony ass.
- Right.

1094
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:56,434
..bony ass out of my sight.

1095
01:43:56,768 --> 01:44:02,357
I'm sorry, but I simply
won't stand for that kind of talk.

1096
01:44:04,651 --> 01:44:06,945
Will you excuse me, please?

1097
01:44:17,872 --> 01:44:20,834
Why didn't you tell us all this
in the boardroom that day?

1098
01:44:20,917 --> 01:44:23,628
No one was gonna listen, sir. Not to me.

1099
01:44:23,962 --> 01:44:27,715
You can bend the rules upstairs,
but not while you're trying to get there.

1100
01:44:27,799 --> 01:44:31,469
And someone like me
can't get there without bending the rules.

1101
01:44:31,553 --> 01:44:37,350
You've got a real fire in your belly. Or was
this just a one-time stunt that you pulled?

1102
01:44:37,434 --> 01:44:41,604
I have something in my belly,
but I think it's nervous knots.

1103
01:44:42,313 --> 01:44:45,567
Are you willing to go out on that limb
every day, working for me?

1104
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:48,194
- Legitimately?
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:44:48,278 --> 01:44:51,865
- Have to be at the entry level. Any problem?
- No, sir.

1106
01:44:52,657 --> 01:44:55,869
- Gumption, Miss McGill.
- Yes, sir.

1107
01:44:55,952 --> 01:44:58,037
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

1108
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:03,126
Trainer, Dwayne. Let's go to my office
and see about Slim whatshisname's contract.

1109
01:45:03,251 --> 01:45:05,712
Be right with you, sir.

1110
01:45:11,342 --> 01:45:14,471
- Way to go, Tess. Way to go.
- Beauty.

1111
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:43,792
For you. You like it?

1112
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:51,257
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Milk money.

1113
01:45:53,093 --> 01:45:55,428
Twinkies.

1114
01:45:55,512 --> 01:45:58,306
Pen, pencil, ruler. Apple for the teacher.

1115
01:45:59,057 --> 01:46:05,271
Remember. Play nice with the other kids
and make sure you're home before dark.

1116
01:46:18,993 --> 01:46:20,245
Hi. Tess McGill.

1117
01:46:20,328 --> 01:46:22,372
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1118
01:46:22,455 --> 01:46:27,460
The director is out sick today, so she'll
want to see you first thing tomorrow.

1119
01:46:27,544 --> 01:46:31,756
Miss Baxter's already up there.
She'll show you the layout.

1120
01:46:32,298 --> 01:46:36,094
- It's all the way at the end of the hall.
- All right. Thank you.

1121
01:46:36,177 --> 01:46:38,263
You're welcome.

1122
01:46:47,564 --> 01:46:50,316
Anybody'll be an improvement
over that terrorist.

1123
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,319
I mean, something semi-human.

1124
01:47:05,206 --> 01:47:07,792
I didn't hear you come in.

1125
01:47:07,876 --> 01:47:10,253
- I'm Alice Baxter.
- Tess McGill.

1126
01:47:11,087 --> 01:47:13,798
I was just using the phone.

1127
01:47:14,632 --> 01:47:17,093
Yes, well, that happens.

1128
01:47:18,178 --> 01:47:21,306
- How about some coffee?
- Sure. Just tell me where.

1129
01:47:21,389 --> 01:47:24,434
No, I'll get it. How?

1130
01:47:24,893 --> 01:47:27,145
Milk and sugar, please.

1131
01:47:27,228 --> 01:47:29,314
Thank you.

1132
01:47:50,585 --> 01:47:52,670
- Miss McGill.
- Yes?

1133
01:47:53,463 --> 01:47:56,299
That's your desk, in there.

1134
01:47:57,133 --> 01:47:59,344
I don't think so.

1135
01:47:59,469 --> 01:48:01,971
Oh, yes. I sit out here.

1136
01:48:03,223 --> 01:48:06,559
I'm sorry. I thought
the secretary would sit out here.

1137
01:48:06,643 --> 01:48:09,354
That's right. I'm the secretary.

1138
01:48:11,106 --> 01:48:13,691
If it's OK, I prefer "assistant".

1139
01:48:29,124 --> 01:48:32,794
You've got a 10 o'clock meeting
with Slater from Development - here.

1140
01:48:32,877 --> 01:48:37,048
11 o'clock with Donohue
from Logistics - his office on 23.

1141
01:48:37,173 --> 01:48:40,927
And lunch with Mr Trask -
his office downtown, one o'clock.

1142
01:48:42,011 --> 01:48:46,766
It's all right there on the computer.
Just hit shift-S for your schedule.

1143
01:48:54,649 --> 01:48:59,738
When I saw you in here
on the phone with your feet up,

1144
01:49:00,321 --> 01:49:02,824
I figured this was your office.

1145
01:49:04,409 --> 01:49:08,538
I'm sorry about that, Miss McGill.
It won't happen again ever.

1146
01:49:08,663 --> 01:49:10,415
It's OK.

1147
01:49:11,583 --> 01:49:15,712
Maybe now would be a good time
to go over what you expect of me.

1148
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,803
I... I expect you to call me Tess.

1149
01:49:24,763 --> 01:49:28,892
I don't expect you to fetch me coffee
unless you're getting some for yourself.

1150
01:49:29,017 --> 01:49:35,148
And the rest we'll just make up
as we go along.

1151
01:49:36,232 --> 01:49:38,318
OK?

1152
01:49:40,612 --> 01:49:42,697
OK.

1153
01:49:44,199 --> 01:49:48,286
- I'll be right outside if you need anything.
- Fine.

1154
01:50:00,715 --> 01:50:02,509
Cyn.

1155
01:50:02,634 --> 01:50:04,928
Guess where I am?
