1
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:26,590
And on that point,
members of the jury, ...

2
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,349
..I rest my case.

3
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:49,228
(camera shutter clicks)

4
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:55,307
(alarm clock rings)

5
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,946
HeIIo, Wanda.

6
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,381
Hi, Ken.

7
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,181
HeIIo, W-W-Wanda.

8
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,741
Ken, ...

9
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,701
..this is Otto.

10
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,581
HeIIo, Ken.
Wanda's told me a Iot about you.

11
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,300
Hey! Great fish!

12
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,620
A squeeze of Iemon,
some tartare sauce... perfect!

13
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,259
George back yet?

14
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:51,260
No, he had to g-g-go...

15
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,419
..to the b-b-b...

16
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,419
What?

17
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,340
That's quite a stutter you've got there,
Ken.

18
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,659
(laughs)
It's aII right, it doesn't bother me.

19
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,379
So er...
George needs a weapons man, eh?

20
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,459
A cup of tea, Ken?

21
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,859
Y-y-y...

22
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,818
Yeah, he'd Iike one.

23
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,699
I had a good friend in the CIA,
had a stutter.

24
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,619
Cost him his Iife, dammit.

25
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,178
(door opens)

26
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,018
Hi, George.

27
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,018
HeIIo, George.

28
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,738
Get you a Scotch?

29
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,017
Yeah.

30
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,697
George, ...

31
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:31,257
..this is Otto.

32
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,337
So, ...

33
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,337
..you're Wanda's brother?

34
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:36,776
Good to be here, George.

35
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:38,697
England is a fine country.

36
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:40,977
Did she teII you what we need?

37
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,936
(Ken gasps)

38
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,416
(Otto) Something Iike that?

39
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,456
Something Iike that.

40
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,536
HeIIo, Wendy.

41
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,456
Had a good day?

42
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:06,016
I spend the morning
trying to get a waste disposal man.

43
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:09,375
At Iunch, Marjorie just
complained about her husband...

44
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,294
..then I have to play
three rubbers with Philippa.

45
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,614
I come back and
Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

46
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,014
Oh, no!

47
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,094
Would you Iike some tea?

48
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,174
Yes.

49
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,773
I won the case.

50
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,973
This is the first moment
I've had to myseIf aII day.

51
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:33,413
HeIIo, Portia! How was the show?

52
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,813
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

53
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,693
- But you Iiked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

54
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,093
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

55
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,493
- Oughtn't we...
- I thought you were making tea.

56
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,892
- I am, darling. Sorry.
- I'd better get it.

57
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:48,652
- No, no, let me do it.
- No! I'II do it!

58
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,092
I won the case.

59
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,972
Now this is cracked.

60
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,892
They're worth about 1 00,000 each.

61
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,732
There are 1 35 of them.

62
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:04,252
That makes 1 3 miIIions, my friends.

63
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,571
DoIIars or pounds?

64
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,011
Pounds, pet.

65
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:09,131
This is the big one. So...

66
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,050
OK.

67
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,050
Yeah.

68
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,450
Otto?

69
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,330
Yes?

70
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,490
OK?

71
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,770
What?

72
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,370
The plan.

73
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,409
Yeah. Great. No problem.

74
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:27,650
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

75
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,489
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

76
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:32,449
Yeah, yeah!

77
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,369
I haven't finished yet.

78
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:37,889
Because the police wiII watch
aII the airports for 72 hours.

79
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,169
I know.

80
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,529
I know.

81
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,288
Do you want me to g-g-get...

82
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,609
..a b-b-big...

83
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,849
..c-c-car?

84
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,648
Getaway?

85
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,128
A Iimo, OK?

86
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,048
And put diplomatic plates on it.

87
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:56,727
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

88
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,327
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

89
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,447
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

90
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,008
So, next week, ...

91
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,527
..we won't have to Iook for work.

92
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,927
And it won't have to Iook for us.

93
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,967
Oscar Wilde.

94
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:18,326
You really Iike animals, don't you, Ken?

95
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,446
What's the attraction?

96
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,886
Because you can t-t-t...

97
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,566
..trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

98
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,686
Shit on you?

99
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,646
Show off aII the time.

100
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:31,486
You know what Nietzsche
said about them?

101
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:33,885
He said they were God's second blunder.

102
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,325
Bye, sis!

103
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:38,485
WeII, you teII him from me that I-I-I...

104
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,685
Bye, George.

105
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,445
If you talk to Mom, teII her I said hi.

106
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,364
- OK.
- (Don't let him touch you.)

107
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,764
One more day, and we're together.

108
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,564
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

109
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:55,604
I know he's insensitive.

110
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,884
He's had a hard Iife.

111
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,923
Dad used to beat him up.

112
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,443
Good.

113
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,364
Aaagh!

114
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:07,883
(screaming)

115
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,758
Anybody moves and you're dead.

116
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,636
(alarm rings)

117
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,756
(dogs yap)

118
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,196
Look where you're going!

119
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:01,996
Chauvinist pig!

120
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:05,235
ReaIIy, people here
just think they own the pavement.

121
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:09,916
(engine starts)

122
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,755
(brakes screech)

123
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:33,474
That was fun.

124
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,394
I Iove robbing the English.

125
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,793
- They're so polite.
- The d-d-d...

126
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,233
- What is it, Ken?
- The dog!

127
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,673
We didn't hit the dog.

128
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:44,313
- $20 miIIion and an insect worries him!
- It's not an in-in...

129
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,713
Stutter's not getting any better.
How about surgery?

130
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:48,833
(George) Shut up!

131
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,193
(siren)

132
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,832
Ken.

133
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,712
Bye!

134
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,111
Let's split.

135
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:33,470
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.
- Lie Iow. No celebrating.

136
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,150
No celebrating?

137
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,110
See you in a couple of hours.

138
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:25,986
To $20 miIIion.

139
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,426
To a job weII done.

140
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:28,386
To us.

141
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:31,266
To the best
brother and sister team since...

142
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,705
Romeo and Juliet?

143
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:35,986
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes
bought our story?

144
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,026
What morons!

145
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:39,425
- I want you to know something.
- What?

146
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:42,785
Even if you were my brother,
I'd stiII want to fuck you.

147
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,545
Oooh!

148
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,305
Make the caII.

149
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:49,025
- Momento, carissima.
- No!

150
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,465
- Eventuale!
- No Italian!

151
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,704
Hey!

152
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:54,945
Per cominciare,
due insalate verdi con peperoni.

153
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,665
- E Iinguine primavera...
- No. No.

154
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:00,784
- Una cotoletta di viteIIo.
- Make the caII, Otto.

155
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,464
Are you really Italian?

156
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:03,904
Absolutamente. Si!

157
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:05,824
My name is Otto. It means eight.

158
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,743
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

159
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:08,703
Bye, George.

160
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,624
(ltalian accent) The police, please.

161
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:11,903
Otto!

162
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:15,423
(English accent) Yes, hello.

163
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:18,303
Sorry to trouble you,
but you may Iike to know...

164
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,383
..that today's Hatton Garden robbery
was puIIed off by Mr George Thomason.

165
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,462
He Iives at flat three, Kipling Mansions, ...

166
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:29,503
..Murray Road, London W9.

167
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:32,581
Wanda!

168
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:44,142
(siren)

169
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,221
(banging on door) Police! Open up!

170
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,900
Come on, open up!

171
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

172
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,939
George Francis Thomason?

173
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,939
Passport, ...

174
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:32,218
..tickets, ...

175
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:33,618
..money!

176
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:39,058
(honks horn)

177
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,857
(Otto) Asshole!

178
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,338
(crashing)

179
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,257
We're rich, Wanda.

180
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,337
Yep?

181
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,256
I bet these weeks with me...

182
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:58,137
..have been
the most exciting weeks of your Iife.

183
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,697
You said it.

184
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,935
(breathes deeply)

185
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,136
(calmly) OK.

186
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,695
OK.

187
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,015
Disappointed!

188
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,855
Sonofabitch!

189
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:23,095
What do you have to do
to make people trust you?!

190
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,494
Shut up.

191
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,935
People are always
taking advantage of me!

192
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:29,615
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

193
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:33,174
What are you doing?

194
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:34,774
I'm thinking!

195
00:14:35,094 --> 00:14:37,014
Thinking what I'II do to him.

196
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,414
I'II hang him up with piano wire...

197
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,533
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to talk to him.

198
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,693
Talk to who?

199
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,134
Talk to who?!

200
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,773
So, while instaIIing these windows, ...

201
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,652
..you knelt on some broken glass
from the pane you had dropped.

202
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:53,813
That's right, sir.

203
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:56,092
Your parents can confirm this?

204
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:57,172
Yes, and his aunt, ...

205
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,052
..Georgina Thomason.

206
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,053
Good, Bartlett.

207
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,972
- (knock at door)
- Yes?

208
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,892
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

209
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:06,292
Thomason. A young Iady to see you.

210
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,612
- Anything else?
- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

211
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,092
No, absolutely not.

212
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,052
George!

213
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,851
Ken's got the fish food. He'II be in Iater.

214
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,371
- Thanks.
- De nada.

215
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,811
What do you think, Mr Leach?

216
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,491
We may be OK on the glass,
but what else wiII they come up with?

217
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,971
(woIf whistling)

218
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,930
Oh, George!

219
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,810
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

220
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,209
That's not aIIowed in here, miss.

221
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:40,169
Are you OK?

222
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:41,610
It's aII right.

223
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,530
I don't think I can handle this.

224
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,930
I was too afraid to sleep Iast night...

225
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,249
Leave it out, Ieave it out, OK?

226
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,729
Listen, Iisten, Iisten.

227
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:52,089
Listen.

228
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:55,128
You stayed at my place.

229
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,129
We slept Iate.

230
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,368
You made me breakfast.

231
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:05,928
What?

232
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,488
What's he doing here?

233
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,408
He wanted to see you.

234
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,287
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

235
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,207
Do you want me to rub him out?

236
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,127
Anything, you name it.

237
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,487
I have friends making enquiries.

238
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,807
Good.

239
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,527
The jewels are very safe.

240
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:27,487
If I get sent down, it aII gets
handed back to cut my sentence.

241
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,087
Now, to cut my sentence even more, ...

242
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,847
..I could teII them who done it with me...

243
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,726
..if I wasn't very happy about everything.

244
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,206
What was the middle thing?

245
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,645
Piss off.

246
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:47,446
- You want me to spring you...
- Now!

247
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,405
George?

248
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,365
You don't think...

249
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,724
Do you?

250
00:16:58,285 --> 00:16:59,485
No!

251
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,324
No.

252
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,244
No!

253
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,685
OK.

254
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,204
- George.
- What?

255
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:12,843
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

256
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,523
Trust me.

257
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,883
Thank you very much.

258
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,364
Thanks a Iot. Bye.

259
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,083
Have a good day.

260
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:23,723
So?

261
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,163
He's not sure it was you.

262
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:26,123
What about you?

263
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,562
No, no, he believes me.

264
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,963
That's why he can't figure out about you.

265
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:31,403
Figure out what?

266
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,123
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

267
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,283
Don't er...

268
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,602
..ever, ever, ever...

269
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,482
..caII me stupid. OK?

270
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:45,161
What?

271
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,201
That's George's Iawyer.

272
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,121
The other guy must be the barrister.

273
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:55,641
So?

274
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:57,321
Trust me.

275
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:02,881
Let me know
if anything unexpected turns...

276
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,321
Excuse me.

277
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,280
Don't I recognise you?

278
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,800
No. No, I don't think so.

279
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
Oh.

280
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,199
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

281
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,240
Erm...

282
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,959
WeII, hardly.

283
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,799
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

284
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,039
Yes, yes, certainly.

285
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,999
Thanks.

286
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,759
I'm studying aspects of your Iegal system.

287
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:27,839
I'm American.

288
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,799
Oh, really?

289
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,519
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

290
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,039
What er... What brings you here?

291
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,998
Oh, it's a Iittle embarrassing.

292
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:37,838
I... have a friend.

293
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,119
Oh!

294
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,318
I see.

295
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,758
There you are.

296
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:42,718
I knew it!

297
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,158
You're Archie Leash.

298
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,477
Leach.

299
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:46,557
Right.

300
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:47,997
I saw you in court!

301
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,877
Er... two weeks ago.

302
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:51,838
The casino break-in?

303
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,277
You were great!

304
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,197
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

305
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:57,117
I Iove the way you er...

306
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,837
..cross-examine.

307
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:01,797
Oh, I really admire your work.

308
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,876
Thank you.

309
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,676
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose...

310
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,397
No? Fine, right.

311
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,556
WeII, ...

312
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,396
Thank you for this.

313
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,236
I'II treasure it.

314
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:17,315
Au revoir.

315
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:22,116
You speak French, too!

316
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:42,714
What's going on?

317
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,994
Whatever George decides to do,
he'II teII Leach first.

318
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,794
Why?

319
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:49,434
Because he's his Iawyer.

320
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:50,394
Yeah, I know that.

321
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,794
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

322
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:55,793
So George wiII teII him
where the diamonds are?

323
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,593
That's what I'm going to find out.

324
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:11,992
You done weII, my son.

325
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,472
Now, where are we going to hide it?

326
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,752
(inaudible)

327
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:19,192
Very good!

328
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,111
Don't teII Wanda anything.

329
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,511
Otto might get something out of her.

330
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:24,471
Now...

331
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:25,831
George.

332
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,831
You are going to g-get off?

333
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:30,191
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

334
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,191
We'II fix it.

335
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:32,631
Now, anything on Otto?

336
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,190
No. Not yet.

337
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,150
You watch him.

338
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,030
Ken!

339
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,350
OK.

340
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,430
Looks Iike the police have been aII over it.

341
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,469
Let me change clothes,
then I'II help you Iook.

342
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:53,229
(English accent) HeIIo, ...

343
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:55,150
..K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

344
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,349
Hey!

345
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,429
Wake up!

346
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:01,829
Wake up, Iimey fish!

347
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:06,628
So. How are you going to get friendly
with this Iawyer?

348
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:08,908
I don't know. I'II improvise.

349
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:10,508
Fucking insects!

350
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:13,948
I thought Englishmen didn't Iike women,
the way they talk.

351
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:15,787
No!

352
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:19,388
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,
in a pompous sort of way.

353
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:22,028
Have you got the hots for him?

354
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:24,427
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

355
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:26,307
(laughs)

356
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:28,707
What is this? Hump-a-Iimey week?

357
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,667
Otto doesn't approve.

358
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,587
Otto might get jealous.

359
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:34,867
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

360
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,227
Molto pericoloso...

361
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:46,506
Carissima.

362
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,506
Oh, speak it, speak it!

363
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:51,305
Un ossobuco milanese con piseIIi.

364
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,146
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

365
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:58,985
Dov'è Ia farmacia?

366
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,625
Yes, yes, yes!

367
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:01,865
No, no, no.

368
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,784
- Si, si, si.
- No, no, no.

369
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:04,744
No, not here.

370
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:06,185
Otto, not here.

371
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:07,625
Dov'è Ia Fontana di Trevi?

372
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,585
Not here, Otto!

373
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:09,905
Erm...

374
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:10,984
MozzareIIa...

375
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,424
Er... Parmigiana...

376
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,544
- Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

377
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:16,743
(silence)

378
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,464
Wanda!

379
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:28,503
Look what I've got, Wanda.

380
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,663
Treasure!

381
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,781
Ssh!

382
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:15,820
Aaagh!

383
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,060
Ooh!

384
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,700
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

385
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,100
I thought it was the police again.

386
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,019
Isn't it horrible about George?

387
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:26,380
I've such a headache.
Could you go and get me some aspirin?

388
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,820
- (clattering)
- Shit.

389
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,699
- What's that?
- My brother's using the bathroom.

390
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:33,500
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

391
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,179
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

392
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:43,658
Isn't it terrible about George?

393
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,219
When I find the bastard who squealed!

394
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,738
I Iove that man!

395
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:51,138
What are you d-d-doing here?

396
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,258
What am I doing here?

397
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:56,137
Wanda was upset, Ken.
She needed to talk to family.

398
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:57,418
Sh...

399
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,857
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

400
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,817
I've got to speak to you.

401
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,417
(Wanda wails)

402
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,177
Are you OK, now, sis?

403
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:10,536
- I'm fine, thanks for coming.
- CaII me if you need me.

404
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:15,856
What's up with you?
Can't you think about her feelings?

405
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,776
Something f-f-funny is going on.

406
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:19,216
Oh dear, oh dear.

407
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,616
You don't know why you're excited.

408
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,056
- I saw the b...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

409
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:26,335
I didn't want to say anything
while George was around.

410
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,815
Isn't it time you faced facts?

411
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,215
Come on!

412
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:33,455
You're a very attractive man.

413
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:34,575
You're smart.

414
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:36,495
You've got wonderful bones, ...

415
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:39,255
..great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

416
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,334
Wh-wh-wh...

417
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,254
We could have a Iot of fun together.

418
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:45,055
I think we'd be really good for each other.

419
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:46,854
What do you say?

420
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:49,895
You must be j-j-j...

421
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:50,894
May I kiss you, Ken?

422
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:52,334
No, you fucking can't!

423
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:54,253
Just a peck! No tongue!

424
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:55,213
No, no!

425
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,934
(Otto) Ken! Ken!

426
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:02,213
Ken!

427
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,813
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

428
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:06,413
OK, no, Iook.

429
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:07,692
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:09,613
I've handled this badly.

431
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:12,013
Look, the physical side can wait.

432
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,133
You need time.

433
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,892
WiII you think about it?

434
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,891
Oh, my God.

435
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,730
Oh, my God!

436
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,370
Ken!

437
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,490
Somebody just caIIed!

438
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,410
They said that the police...

439
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,810
No, that the Ioot
is in a garage in Fulham.

440
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,729
You and I have to go get it now.

441
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:57,129
We have to move it
before the police find it.

442
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,570
No, no, no...

443
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,490
- What?
- It's aII right!

444
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,409
- What?
- Ge-Ge-Ge...

445
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:03,849
George...

446
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,289
M-m-m...

447
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,769
..moved...

448
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:09,209
George moved the Ioot?!

449
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,849
Yes.

450
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,489
Where did he move it, Ken?

451
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,448
Where did he move it?!

452
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,289
C-c-c...

453
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:29,208
I don't know where it is.
There's a key for something.

454
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,768
It's in...

455
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:33,608
Don't teII me.

456
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:36,087
It's better that you don't teII me.

457
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,646
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

458
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:46,526
Otto....

459
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,846
..tried to k-k-k...

460
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:51,406
..kiss me.

461
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:55,126
I thought he might.

462
00:26:57,606 --> 00:26:58,806
No.

463
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,966
Nothing, no marks at aII.

464
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,885
But it is a safety deposit box key?

465
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,566
Yes, but there are miIIions of them, ...

466
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,685
..hotels, banks, offices.

467
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:08,644
Sorry.

468
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:10,125
Thank you.

469
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:11,925
(Fuck!)

470
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:29,283
That's him.

471
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:31,203
That's him, Inspector.

472
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:33,964
He's the one
who tried to murder my dogs.

473
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:37,404
(doorbell rings)

474
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:52,922
Davidson!

475
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:56,722
An American Iegal student
wants to see me for a moment.

476
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:59,162
- What time is Sir John due?
- 1 2.30, sir.

477
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:00,482
Right.

478
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,120
Come in!

479
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:14,041
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

480
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,840
Am I interrupting?

481
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Absolutely not.

482
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,761
ReaIIy?

483
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,760
ReaIIy. Delighted to see you.

484
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,081
HeIIo.

485
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,800
So.

486
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,960
This is the place.

487
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,879
- This is it.
- Very nice.

488
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:33,040
I was at the courts this morning.
It's fascinating!

489
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,160
ReaIIy, so much to know,

490
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,079
Everybody wears these. Do you?

491
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,359
- Oh, ridiculous!
- (giggles)

492
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,318
WeII, erm...

493
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:45,719
..I only have a few minutes. Sorry.

494
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,679
I'm sorry.

495
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,079
But until then,
I'm aII yours, as they say.

496
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,518
I just have a couple of questions.

497
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,358
I'm having a Iittle problem...

498
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,398
..understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

499
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:00,478
What exactly is the committal?

500
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:02,038
Ah. Interesting.

501
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:04,998
BasicaIIy,
it's a preliminary investigation...

502
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,797
..where the prosecution
presents evidence...

503
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:10,198
..that the accused has a case to answer.

504
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:12,117
That's what it says in the book.

505
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,276
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

506
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:16,796
Right.

507
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,796
- His committal is on Wednesday...
- Thomason?

508
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,037
Yes.

509
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,956
George Thomason?

510
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:25,076
Yes. Do you know him?

511
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:27,956
I'm defending him.

512
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,875
What are you talking about?

513
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,155
I'm his barrister, his Iawyer.

514
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:34,955
That's so great!

515
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:38,515
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

516
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:41,115
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

517
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:42,835
Thank you.

518
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,915
He's sure to get off now.

519
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:46,955
Wow!

520
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,555
I can watch you work now!

521
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,914
PIease.

522
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:54,354
Amazing.

523
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:55,314
WeII, anyway.

524
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,194
At the committal,
George would then plead...

525
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,114
Not guilty.

526
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:01,473
ReaIIy?

527
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:04,193
The evidence is Iargely circumstantial.

528
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,833
But wasn't there an identification?

529
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,753
True, but a very elderly Iady.

530
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:11,193
I think they've got the wrong man.

531
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,513
You don't think he did it?

532
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,473
No.

533
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,872
Let's just say, for argument's sake, ...

534
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,792
..that you did think he did it.

535
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,872
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to Iight.

536
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:24,112
Right, right.

537
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:27,072
You would then advise him
to plead guilty, ...

538
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:30,632
..and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

539
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:34,151
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

540
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:37,551
TheoreticaIIy, yes, yes.

541
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:38,511
Oh, of course.

542
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:40,191
Erm. WeII er...

543
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:44,030
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

544
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,151
Wanda.

545
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,511
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

546
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,870
WeII, Wanda, there are three...

547
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,711
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

548
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:58,950
Yes.

549
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,150
Oh, my God.

550
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,830
What?

551
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,950
You're his alibi.

552
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,830
I can't talk to you!

553
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:07,309
Why not?

554
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,710
My dear Iady, you're a defence witness!

555
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,109
I'm sorry, I must ask you to Ieave.

556
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,549
What did I say?

557
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:16,429
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

558
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:18,348
Everybody does it in America.

559
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:20,268
Not in England, it's forbidden.

560
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:22,669
I insist, or I may have
to give up the case.

561
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,469
I'm sorry. PIease.

562
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:30,428
Oh, Archie.

563
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:36,267
I didn't come here to talk about
boring criminal procedures.

564
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:40,307
Come on, you know!

565
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,427
You knew the minute I walked in here.

566
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:47,706
I want you.

567
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:51,787
What?

568
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:53,706
(intercom buzzes)

569
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:55,306
- HeIIo?
- Sir John is here.

570
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:56,746
Show him in, please.

571
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:58,546
Make Iove with me.

572
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,106
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

573
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:02,785
- WiII you take me to bed?
- No, sorry.

574
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:06,906
Bye, Uncle.

575
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,345
Hi!

576
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:24,825
(rousing music)

577
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:31,303
He's pleading not guilty...

578
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:33,704
..so you're safe until the trial.

579
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:36,464
Leach doesn't think he did it.

580
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,903
Ken says
there's a safe deposit box key, ...

581
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:43,423
..but only George knows where it is.

582
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:45,623
Thank you, Wanda(!)

583
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,503
What have you found out?

584
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:51,942
Not a Iot.

585
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:54,342
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

586
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:55,782
I know that!

587
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,223
So nothing, huh?

588
00:32:57,223 --> 00:32:58,462
Nix.

589
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:00,382
Zip.

590
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,942
Diddly.

591
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,422
Bupkiss.

592
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,742
Niente.

593
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:12,581
Oh, it's too big!

594
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:14,981
- No, it isn't, Portia.
- It's enormous!

595
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:17,381
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, please, Mother!

596
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:18,820
No! Absolutely not!

597
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,581
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

598
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,540
Do shut up, Portia!

599
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:26,980
AII I get, aII day,
is people complaining to me.

600
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,380
Oh dear.

601
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,260
Ecco I'uomo.

602
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:57,219
Ooh, Ie due cupole grandi
deIIa cattedrale di Milano.

603
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,255
Benito Mussolini!

604
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,695
Dov'è il Vaticano?

605
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,174
(mutters)

606
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,134
# Volare

607
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,493
# Oh-oh

608
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,093
# E cantare

609
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:19,453
# Oh-oh...

610
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:32,892
Archie, I want you to speak to her
about plastic surgery.

611
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,452
- Hmm?
- I do wish you'd Iisten to me.

612
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:38,612
I want you to speak to Portia.

613
00:35:38,612 --> 00:35:41,011
I'II speak to her in the morning.

614
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,811
Goodnight, Archie.

615
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:45,212
Goodnight, Archie!

616
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:47,091
Goodnight, Wanda.

617
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,411
Goodnight, who?

618
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:53,451
Sorry, darling.
Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow...

619
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,890
..with some Iousy old hag.

620
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,330
Are you George Francis Thomason...

621
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:01,650
..of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue, ...

622
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,210
..London W9?

623
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,490
Yes, sir.

624
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,970
The charge is one of armed robbery.

625
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,770
Are we ready for a committal,
Mr Percival?

626
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,050
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

627
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,049
That is correct, 6.2.

628
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,369
Here are the statements,
aII to be fuIIy bound, please.

629
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,409
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

630
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:24,809
You are committed to stand trial...

631
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:27,169
..at the Central Criminal Court.

632
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:30,088
There is some urgency about this case.

633
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,528
The main witness, Mrs Coady, ...

634
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:35,088
..is elderly and has had
serious heart difficulties recently.

635
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,647
Is there any possibility
that this case...

636
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,607
..might be put down for an early trial?

637
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:44,007
That is for the OId Bailey Iisting officer.

638
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:46,807
Take him down to the ceII, please, officer.

639
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,525
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

640
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,926
You Iook great. I Iove your hair.

641
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:10,886
Got time for a coffee?

642
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:13,286
- No, I've g-g...
- Have you thought about it?

643
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:15,205
Why did he give you this?

644
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,125
Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.

645
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,685
Does he want you to send her flowers?

646
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:20,964
Do her shopping?

647
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:22,405
Show her a good time?

648
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,965
Rub her out?

649
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,405
He wants you to rub her out?

650
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,484
He's going to kiII her!

651
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,884
(laughs)

652
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:37,524
Fuck off, or I'II kiII you.

653
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:39,843
Limey fruits!

654
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:44,003
So the old Iady wiII
m-meet with an accident?

655
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:46,243
- Eh, K-K-Ken?
- Sssh. Sssh!

656
00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:47,803
(laughs)

657
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:49,763
What's so funny?

658
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:52,843
Nothing.
Just that wasting old Iadies isn't nice.

659
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:55,882
WeII, it's better than b-buggering people.

660
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,522
I bet you pound 1 you don't kiII her.

661
00:38:00,803 --> 00:38:01,763
AII right.

662
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:03,242
AII right.

663
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,082
I Iove watching your ass when you walk.

664
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:08,202
Is that beautiful or what?

665
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:10,762
Don't go near him!

666
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,362
He's mine!

667
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:15,201
pound 1 says you won't kiII her!

668
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,602
(laughs)

669
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,001
When could you Iook at it?

670
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:23,201
Let's think.
My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

671
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:26,241
I'II Iook at it then
and caII you on Saturday.

672
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:28,961
- I really appreciate it. Thanks.
- Bye.

673
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,080
Hi.

674
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,480
I know we're not aIIowed to talk.

675
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,921
Give me a caII.

676
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:35,320
I can't.

677
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,280
PIease?

678
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
We're not aIIowed to speak.

679
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
We don't have to.

680
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,719
I don't want you for your conversation.

681
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,440
I'd Iove to...

682
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:56,879
(wails)

683
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,718
(continues howling)

684
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,398
- What happened?
- Got a date, Friday.

685
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,238
(whistles)

686
00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:19,678
(dogs yap)

687
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,558
Look here!

688
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:24,396
Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

689
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:26,357
My dogs wiII be having their nap.

690
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:27,877
Nice doggy.

691
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,196
Nice... doggy.

692
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:31,677
(snarling)

693
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:48,916
Otto, what are you doing?

694
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:51,315
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

695
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:53,235
It focuses your aggression.

696
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:56,114
The monks did it
before they went into battle.

697
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:58,395
What kind of Buddhism is this?

698
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,515
(honks horn)

699
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,835
(crashing)

700
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,235
Asshole!

701
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:07,634
It's an early Tantric meditation...

702
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:09,075
What is this?

703
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,513
To get information,
I might have to get friendly with him.

704
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:15,233
WeII, we're ready now, at Iast.

705
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:17,713
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

706
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:20,593
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- MarveIIous.

707
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:21,993
Be good.

708
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:25,793
When you say friendly,
what are we talking about here?

709
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:27,712
Cordial? Courteous?

710
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,353
Supportive? What?

711
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:32,153
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

712
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:35,833
So, friendly might include actual er...

713
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:37,992
..what, penetration?

714
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:39,912
I don't need your jealousy now.

715
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:41,352
- Jealousy?
- Yes.

716
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:44,432
Hey, I'm merely curious.
Me? Jealous of that fop?

717
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,712
What about my tits?

718
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,230
Does he get to handle them?

719
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,111
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'II stand by that.

720
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:00,551
Nuzzling?

721
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:02,951
I think $20 miIIion is worth a nuzzle.

722
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:03,910
80% chance there.

723
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,750
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren't jealous.

724
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,151
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,
it's for the weak.

725
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,590
One thing, though.

726
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,870
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

727
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:21,629
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

728
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,110
Aren't we going, then?

729
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,110
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

730
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:38,069
(Hurry up.)

731
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,147
Hi.

732
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:58,627
Do you despise me?

733
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,787
No, that's not a word that Ieaps to mind.

734
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:08,186
Can I stay, then?

735
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:15,026
Of course. Look, ...

736
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,465
- Wanda...
- I know.

737
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:18,905
Your wife's coming back.

738
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:21,306
No, it's not her. She'II be hours.

739
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,226
It's about what I said to you.

740
00:42:23,226 --> 00:42:25,145
It is aII right for us to speak.

741
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:26,105
It is?

742
00:42:26,105 --> 00:42:28,784
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

743
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,664
Oh.

744
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,344
Oh, fine.

745
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:34,745
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

746
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:36,584
Oh, but they won't.

747
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,664
Sorry if I seem...

748
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,224
..pompous.

749
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:49,423
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

750
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:54,663
No.

751
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,303
Not yet.

752
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,904
I'm thirsty.

753
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,583
What shaII I get you?

754
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,383
Whisky.

755
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:12,622
You are the sexiest,
most beautiful girl...

756
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:15,062
..I have ever seen...

757
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:17,902
..in my entire Iife.

758
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:22,062
Get me my drink.

759
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,061
(Wanda giggles)

760
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,380
(Wanda sighs)

761
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,900
Oh, Archie.

762
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,220
Mm, Archie.

763
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:55,619
So.

764
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,059
If George decides to change his plea, ...

765
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,459
..he'd teII you
where the Ioot is first, wouldn't he?

766
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,779
Mm?

767
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:07,378
Darling, we mustn't talk
about the trial, OK?

768
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,858
I know. I just meant theoreticaIIy.

769
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:12,378
Kiss me there.

770
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,058
Oh. TheoreticaIIy.

771
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:16,297
Erm.

772
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,897
(mumbles)

773
00:44:21,778 --> 00:44:24,617
(mumbling)
..to his Iegal representative...

774
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:34,737
What's the matter?

775
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,657
Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

776
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:37,896
Ooh!

777
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:40,976
Aah!

778
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,416
What? What, darling?

779
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,816
- You're getting me hot!
- Sorry.

780
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,256
I need something to drink.

781
00:44:46,256 --> 00:44:47,696
Something cold?

782
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:49,136
Maybe in the fridge?

783
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:50,096
Champagne?

784
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:51,856
Oh, my favourite.

785
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:54,616
Don't go away.

786
00:44:57,296 --> 00:44:58,815
Je reviens!

787
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:10,255
What are you doing here?

788
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:12,655
- Relax!
- Get the fuck out of here!

789
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:15,894
- Your moaning worried me.
- I was faking it, stupid!

790
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:17,454
Don't ever caII me stupid.

791
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:19,853
- And I'm not jealous.
- Then Ieave!

792
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,054
OK!

793
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:23,094
It's a nice place.

794
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:26,573
Don't touch his dick!

795
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:29,854
His wife, his wife!

796
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:31,653
(Wendy chatters)

797
00:45:32,812 --> 00:45:35,253
For goodness sake, get off to bed.

798
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,613
God, there isn't any ice.

799
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:52,051
Champagne!

800
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:53,811
Aaagh!

801
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,731
What's the matter?

802
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:58,651
What are you doing?

803
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,571
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.

804
00:46:02,571 --> 00:46:04,890
Erm... let me pour you a glass.

805
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,370
Whose is the car?

806
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,770
The car?

807
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,651
BIocking the drive?

808
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:12,171
There you are, dear. Cheers.

809
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:14,090
Nice to see you again.

810
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,050
How was the opera?

811
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,930
- Finished early, did it?
- Whose car is it?

812
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,210
Mine.

813
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,809
It's a beauty, isn't it?

814
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:23,289
Where did I Ieave my drink, Archie?

815
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,730
Who is this?

816
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,529
Don't you know?

817
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:28,969
How do you do, Mrs Leach?

818
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,489
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.

819
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:34,729
- I'm... with the CIA.
- The CIA?

820
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:36,169
That's correct, ma'am.

821
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,889
I was er...
just teIIing your husband...

822
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:42,569
..before I had to go
to your beautiful bathroom.

823
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:46,568
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

824
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:49,608
We're debriefing him as of now...

825
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:50,568
..and we're just er...

826
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:53,168
..checking aII the houses in the area.

827
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:55,367
- For what?
- For KGB.

828
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,768
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no.

829
00:46:57,768 --> 00:46:59,688
No er... No, not now.

830
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:01,568
We er...

831
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:04,247
We just want to keep everyone informed.

832
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,407
So. Archie, thanks for the drink.

833
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,326
Sorry to have troubled you...

834
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,767
Keep everyone informed?

835
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,687
So there's no panic, ma'am.

836
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:13,127
But isn't it a secret?

837
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:15,046
You've no idea how secret.

838
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:17,526
WeII, why are you teIIing everyone?

839
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:19,806
It's a smoke screen?

840
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:21,167
What?!

841
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:22,246
(Otto) Double bluff.

842
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:25,405
You obviously know nothing
about inteIIigence work.

843
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,285
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

844
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:31,965
My father was in the Secret Service,
Mr Manfredjen St John.

845
00:47:32,325 --> 00:47:35,805
I know perfectly weII
you don't keep the public informed...

846
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:38,844
..when you are debriefing KGB defectors.

847
00:47:39,045 --> 00:47:40,005
Oh, you don't, huh(?)

848
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:43,204
Not unless you're
congenitaIIy insane or stupid, no.

849
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,725
Don't caII me stupid.

850
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:48,965
Why on earth not?

851
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,484
Oh, you English are so superior,
aren't you?

852
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:56,323
Do you know where you'd be...

853
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,724
..without us,
the old US of A to protect you?

854
00:47:58,724 --> 00:47:59,684
I'II teII you.

855
00:47:59,684 --> 00:48:03,403
The smaIIest fucking province
in the Russian Empire, that's what!

856
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:06,283
So don't caII me stupid, Iady.

857
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:07,362
Just thank me.

858
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:09,763
Thank you for popping in
and protecting us(!)

859
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:12,643
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be speaking German!

860
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,083
# Deutschland, Deutschland

861
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,642
# Über alles

862
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:19,842
He's covering for me.
Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

863
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:22,242
Necklace. I'II think of something.

864
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:24,642
- Who are you talking to?
- Myself, darling.

865
00:48:24,642 --> 00:48:28,121
- Who was that shouting?
- Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.

866
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,401
(Wendy) Archie, who on earth...

867
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:31,361
I don't know. He...

868
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:33,762
- I need a drink.
- Let's go to the pub.

869
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:35,081
What?!

870
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:36,641
Let's go to the pub.

871
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,081
Would you Iike to, Portia?

872
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,521
We haven't been for 1 5 years!

873
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:41,440
Portia could see it now.

874
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,400
Honestly, Archie!

875
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,360
Aaagh!

876
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,281
What on earth is the matter?

877
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:47,160
I thought the picture was faIIing off.

878
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,081
WiII you puII yourseIf together?!

879
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:50,521
What's this?

880
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:52,840
Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?

881
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,880
(Wendy) What was that?

882
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,800
- A kind of necklace.
- Aah!

883
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,760
What's going on?

884
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,559
Nothing. Let's go.

885
00:48:58,679 --> 00:48:59,639
Can I see that?

886
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,680
- What?
- In your hand.

887
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,480
Your other hand.

888
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,439
(tuts)

889
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,879
Portia, go to your room.

890
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:07,319
Aren't we going out?

891
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,759
I can explain. I Ieft...

892
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:09,719
Now!

893
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,118
- They sent a new girl...
- Oh, Archie.

894
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:14,039
No, she's Canadian...

895
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:16,038
It's Iovely. Thank you.

896
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:21,519
It's even got a W for Wendy.

897
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:23,918
Oh, I'm so glad you Iike it.

898
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:28,238
It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever given me.

899
00:49:32,757 --> 00:49:35,117
Oh, Archie. This isn't Iike you.

900
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:44,837
Are you fucking crazy?!

901
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:48,116
Hey, I saved your ass.

902
00:49:48,116 --> 00:49:50,997
I had him right where I wanted him,
you asshole!

903
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:53,396
(Wanda) I give you
one fucking thing to!

904
00:49:53,396 --> 00:49:56,075
(Wanda) You had to drive me and shut up!

905
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:57,236
(Otto) Oh, relax!

906
00:49:57,236 --> 00:49:58,915
(car pulls off)

907
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:02,675
(phone rings)

908
00:50:05,395 --> 00:50:06,715
HeIIo.

909
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,195
Hold on.

910
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:10,835
It's for you.

911
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:13,435
HeIIo.

912
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:17,914
Not at the moment, no.

913
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:24,194
Yes, weII, I'm not quite sure
when I can get hold of that.

914
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:27,954
Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.

915
00:50:27,954 --> 00:50:30,033
Yes. As soon as possible.

916
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:34,033
WeII, that would be very nice, obviously.

917
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:36,113
So. Erm...

918
00:50:36,113 --> 00:50:37,554
See you soon, I hope.

919
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:39,073
Bye, Frank.

920
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,193
(dog snarls)

921
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,872
Calm down. Calm down!

922
00:50:44,872 --> 00:50:47,032
Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

923
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:52,592
(dogs yap)

924
00:50:53,992 --> 00:50:55,432
Come here!

925
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:57,032
SmeII. SmeII!

926
00:50:57,352 --> 00:50:59,271
SmeII, Maggie, smeII.

927
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,711
KiII, kiII!

928
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:05,352
KiII!

929
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:07,032
(Ken) KiII!

930
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,951
(Ken) KiII!

931
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,909
(church bells toll)

932
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,269
We therefore
commit its body to the ground.

933
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,229
Earth to earth.

934
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:37,910
Ashes to ashes.

935
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,749
Dust to dust.

936
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:41,669
(choir sings)

937
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:43,789
# Miserere Dominus

938
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:47,148
# Miserere Dominus

939
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,068
# Canis mortuus est...

940
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:58,268
HeIIo, honey.

941
00:51:58,268 --> 00:51:59,708
What happened?

942
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:01,267
N-n-nothing.

943
00:52:01,627 --> 00:52:03,067
What's that?

944
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:04,027
Er...

945
00:52:04,027 --> 00:52:05,468
Not Granny?

946
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:06,428
Not yet.

947
00:52:06,428 --> 00:52:08,467
Oh. Who is it for, then?

948
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:09,787
A f-f-f...

949
00:52:09,787 --> 00:52:11,587
A fish? Frenchman?

950
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,107
- A phone operator?
- Friend.

951
00:52:14,107 --> 00:52:16,026
Oh, a four-Iegged one? (laughs)

952
00:52:16,026 --> 00:52:17,467
Where's my sister?

953
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,907
She's in the b-b-b...

954
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:20,347
Thank you.

955
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:21,307
Lavatory.

956
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:22,626
Wanda!

957
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,626
Anything?

958
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:27,066
What? No?

959
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:28,986
(shouts) Why are you here?

960
00:52:28,986 --> 00:52:30,906
I'm here because I'm bored!

961
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:34,586
Bored, wandering around
this awful city, shoving George's pic...

962
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:40,425
Talking to a Iot of snotty, stuck-up,
inteIIectuaIIy inferior British faggots.

963
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:45,425
They get rigor mortis
in the prime of Iife in this country!

964
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:48,544
Standing there with their hair clenched...

965
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:52,985
..counting the seconds
tiII the weekend, ...

966
00:52:52,985 --> 00:52:55,744
..so they can dress up
Iike baIIerinas...

967
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:58,264
..at the flat at four...

968
00:52:58,264 --> 00:52:59,824
2B, Saint...

969
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:03,024
To be honest, I er... hate them.

970
00:53:04,503 --> 00:53:07,504
I mean, pretending
they're so fucking lawyer...

971
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:11,783
So fucking superior
with those phoney accents.

972
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:15,062
Not you, Ken.
You've got a beautiful voice...

973
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:16,783
..when it works.

974
00:53:17,463 --> 00:53:19,023
Sonofabitch!

975
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:26,982
(shouts) So er...
Want to have some Iunch?

976
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:28,501
Have you heard from him?

977
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,262
- Who?
- Archie.

978
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:32,822
(shouts) No, I have to finish my hair!

979
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:33,782
Nothing?

980
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:35,222
OK, I'm out of here!

981
00:53:35,222 --> 00:53:37,102
No plans to see him?

982
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,101
No.

983
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:39,702
OK, bye, bro!

984
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,021
Bye, Wanda!

985
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,821
Oh, sorry.

986
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,741
- What?!
- It wasn't theirs to seII.

987
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,981
A old Iady gave it to them to engrave.

988
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,660
Someone put it in the display cabinet...

989
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,260
- That's their problem.
- No. LegaIIy...

990
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,220
You paid for it!

991
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,579
They accept their mistake
and they're offering you this.

992
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:04,499
It's much more valuable.

993
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,380
I adore this
and you want me to give it back...

994
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,779
- I don't want...
- They can't have it.

995
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:10,739
- Wendy.
- No. No!

996
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,179
- Wendy!
- NO!

997
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:14,099
TeII them they can't have it!

998
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:16,299
You're the bloody barrister!

999
00:54:49,337 --> 00:54:51,137
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

1000
00:54:52,696 --> 00:54:54,856
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

1001
00:54:55,576 --> 00:54:57,456
It's just beautiful.

1002
00:55:00,376 --> 00:55:02,136
Oh, my God, Iook!

1003
00:55:03,736 --> 00:55:05,895
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

1004
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,575
Isn't it wonderful?

1005
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:09,016
Whose is it?

1006
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:11,416
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

1007
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,255
And where are they?

1008
00:55:13,335 --> 00:55:14,775
Hong Kong.

1009
00:55:14,775 --> 00:55:16,095
Ah so.

1010
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:17,895
Gone for weeks.

1011
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,375
Nice rug, Archie.

1012
00:55:21,975 --> 00:55:23,295
May I?

1013
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:27,734
Archie, what are you doing?

1014
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,575
The polka, I think.

1015
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:34,974
You make me feel free!

1016
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:36,693
Free?

1017
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:39,973
Do you have any idea
what it's Iike being English?

1018
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:42,973
Being so correct aII the time?

1019
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:46,573
Being so... stifled
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

1020
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:51,253
Asking someone, 'Are you married?'...

1021
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:53,172
..and hearing, 'My wife Ieft me.'

1022
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:55,772
Or saying,
'Do you have children?'...

1023
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,933
..and hearing,
'They burned to death yesterday.'

1024
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:01,812
Wanda, we're aII terrified
of embarrassment.

1025
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:05,932
That's why we're so... dead.

1026
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:09,292
Most of my friends are dead.

1027
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,211
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

1028
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:15,371
But you're alive, God bless you.

1029
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,331
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with aII this.

1030
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,211
I want to make Iove with you, Wanda.

1031
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:24,011
I'm a good Iover.

1032
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:27,130
At Ieast, I used to be
in the early 1 4th century.

1033
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,050
Can we go to bed?

1034
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,290
Yeah.

1035
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,290
Hang on!

1036
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:42,489
Mind your head.

1037
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,169
Agh! Aagh!

1038
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,209
Aaagh! Aaagh!

1039
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,369
I think I Iove you, Wanda.

1040
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:52,889
Oh, Archie.

1041
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,208
Can I ask you a question?

1042
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,168
Anything.

1043
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,969
Where's my Iocket?

1044
00:56:58,569 --> 00:56:59,529
I couldn't get it.

1045
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:00,809
What?

1046
00:57:00,968 --> 00:57:02,888
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

1047
00:57:02,888 --> 00:57:04,808
I got you this instead.

1048
00:57:04,808 --> 00:57:06,487
Do you Iike it?

1049
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,087
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1050
00:57:09,608 --> 00:57:11,607
What's the matter? Why?

1051
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:15,088
My mother gave it to me...

1052
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:17,808
..on her death... bed.

1053
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,286
Oh, I'm sorry.

1054
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:24,007
AII right, darling.

1055
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,447
I'II get it for you.

1056
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:26,407
You promise?

1057
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:27,846
I'II think of something.

1058
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:30,246
Sex is very, very difficult for me...

1059
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:33,206
..with somebody
that I don't trust completely.

1060
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,205
I promise I'II get it. OK?

1061
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:39,006
Ooh! I Iove you, Archie.

1062
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:44,365
(Wanda) I've Ioved you ever since
the first second I saw you!

1063
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:46,446
(thud)

1064
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,684
What was that?

1065
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,245
What?

1066
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:53,284
Your brother didn't bring you
here this time?

1067
00:57:53,284 --> 00:57:54,484
No.

1068
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:56,644
He's no idea?

1069
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,644
He doesn't have a clue.

1070
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:00,324
What?

1071
00:58:01,004 --> 00:58:01,964
He is so dumb...

1072
00:58:01,964 --> 00:58:02,924
ReaIIy?

1073
00:58:02,924 --> 00:58:06,364
He thought the Gettysburg Address
was where LincoIn Iived.

1074
00:58:07,244 --> 00:58:08,724
(laughter)

1075
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,924
Those terrible Iies
he told about the CIA!

1076
00:58:14,443 --> 00:58:15,403
So painful!

1077
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:18,284
When he heard
your daughter's name was Portia, ...

1078
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:21,283
..he said,
'Why did they name her after a car?'

1079
00:58:21,643 --> 00:58:23,563
(hysterical laughter)

1080
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:28,043
I Iove the way you Iaugh!

1081
00:58:28,362 --> 00:58:30,442
I Iove you, you're funny.

1082
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:34,203
How come a girl as bright as you...

1083
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:37,482
..can have a brother who's so...

1084
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:39,401
Don't caII me stupid.

1085
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:40,361
(screaming)

1086
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:41,962
Jesus Christ!

1087
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,521
Ouch! Otto!

1088
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,801
Come on!

1089
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,401
I'II deal with you Iater!

1090
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:58,121
What have you done with her?

1091
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:01,000
- She's aII right!
- (banging at door) Otto!

1092
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,680
Now, apologise.

1093
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,200
What?

1094
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,720
(Wanda) Shit!

1095
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,799
Are you totaIIy deranged?

1096
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,640
You pompous, ...

1097
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,479
..stuck-up, snot-nosed, ...

1098
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:21,879
..English, giant twerp, ...

1099
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,799
..scumbag, fuck-face,
dickhead asshole!

1100
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,878
How very interesting.

1101
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:30,279
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

1102
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:32,598
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

1103
00:59:32,678 --> 00:59:34,358
Now, apologise!

1104
00:59:34,598 --> 00:59:36,398
What? Me to you(?)

1105
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:42,798
Apologise.

1106
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:45,638
AII right, I apologise.

1107
00:59:45,638 --> 00:59:47,077
You're really sorry?

1108
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,517
I'm really, really sorry.

1109
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:50,598
I apologise unreservedly.

1110
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:52,356
You take it back?

1111
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:55,237
I do.
I offer a complete and utter retraction.

1112
00:59:55,237 --> 00:59:58,477
The imputation was totally
without basis in fact, ...

1113
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:00,996
..and was in no way fair comment.

1114
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:03,396
It was motivated purely by malice.

1115
01:00:03,396 --> 01:00:05,317
I deeply regret any distress...

1116
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:08,196
..my comments
may have caused you or your family.

1117
01:00:08,196 --> 01:00:10,116
I hereby undertake not repeat...

1118
01:00:10,116 --> 01:00:13,036
..any such slander
at any time in the future.

1119
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,076
OK.

1120
01:01:06,153 --> 01:01:07,592
(screams)

1121
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:16,632
(church bells toll)

1122
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:19,472
# Miserere Dominus

1123
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:23,791
# Miserere Dominus

1124
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,711
# Canis mortuus est...

1125
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:33,231
You said you Ioved him!

1126
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,230
Right, Otto!
Here's a multiple choice question.

1127
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,430
A. Wanda was Iying.

1128
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,430
B. Wanda was teIIing the truth.

1129
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,790
Which one are you going to pick?

1130
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:44,269
What was the first one?

1131
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:46,190
You said you were not seeing him!

1132
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,590
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

1133
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,989
I was dealing with something delicate.

1134
01:01:50,989 --> 01:01:53,389
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us.

1135
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,268
He knows where the Ioot is
and if you'II be arrested.

1136
01:01:56,268 --> 01:01:58,669
You Iope in
Iike Rambo without a jockstrap...

1137
01:01:58,669 --> 01:02:00,589
..and dangle him from a window!

1138
01:02:00,589 --> 01:02:02,509
Now, was that smart?!

1139
01:02:02,509 --> 01:02:04,149
Was it shrewd?

1140
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:07,068
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

1141
01:02:08,749 --> 01:02:10,668
Don't caII me stupid.

1142
01:02:10,668 --> 01:02:11,628
Oh, right!

1143
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:14,508
To caII you stupid
is an insult to stupid people!

1144
01:02:14,508 --> 01:02:16,907
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

1145
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:19,307
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

1146
01:02:19,307 --> 01:02:22,387
You think you're an inteIIectual,
don't you, ape?

1147
01:02:23,148 --> 01:02:25,067
Apes don't read philosophy.

1148
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:27,947
Yes, they do.
They just don't understand it.

1149
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:31,786
Let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

1150
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:33,906
Aristotle was not Belgian.

1151
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:36,586
The central message of Buddhism...

1152
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,466
- ..is not every man for himself.
- You read...

1153
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:42,626
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

1154
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,226
Those are mistakes. I Iooked 'em up.

1155
01:02:45,226 --> 01:02:47,545
Now. You have just assaulted...

1156
01:02:47,626 --> 01:02:51,186
..the one man who can keep you
out of jail and make you rich.

1157
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:53,865
So what are you
going to do about it, huh?

1158
01:02:53,865 --> 01:02:56,144
What would an inteIIectual do?

1159
01:02:56,746 --> 01:02:58,624
What would PIato do?

1160
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:03,105
(Apologise.)

1161
01:03:03,464 --> 01:03:04,945
Pardon me?

1162
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:06,344
(Apolo...)

1163
01:03:06,344 --> 01:03:07,624
What?

1164
01:03:09,225 --> 01:03:10,544
Right!

1165
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:12,624
I'm sorry.

1166
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,224
No.

1167
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:16,424
Not to me.

1168
01:03:16,424 --> 01:03:17,863
To Archie.

1169
01:03:17,863 --> 01:03:20,223
And make it good, or we're dead.

1170
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,143
Oh, I'm so very,
very, very, very s...

1171
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:31,782
Fuck you!

1172
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,622
I'm s...

1173
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:36,982
I'm very, very s...

1174
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:38,982
I'm so...

1175
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,422
..very s...

1176
01:03:40,422 --> 01:03:42,102
Very, very s...

1177
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:58,341
Very, very...

1178
01:03:58,661 --> 01:04:00,141
..ssfff...

1179
01:04:00,741 --> 01:04:02,420
(glass smashes)

1180
01:05:08,857 --> 01:05:09,817
Ugh!

1181
01:05:09,817 --> 01:05:11,896
(Otto) HeIIo, Mr Burglar!

1182
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:13,656
Going somewhere?

1183
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:15,576
Think you can rob Mr Leach?

1184
01:05:15,576 --> 01:05:17,496
I'II teach you a Iesson.

1185
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,856
He's a very good friend of mine.

1186
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:21,336
(muffled) Otto! Otto!

1187
01:05:21,336 --> 01:05:24,935
He'II be very pleased with me
when he finds you aII tied up...

1188
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,335
..and ready for the police!

1189
01:05:28,535 --> 01:05:30,455
And don't caII me Otto.

1190
01:05:30,455 --> 01:05:32,254
To you, I am Mr...

1191
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:40,854
Aagh!

1192
01:05:41,974 --> 01:05:43,374
Oh, God.

1193
01:05:46,294 --> 01:05:48,214
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1194
01:05:48,214 --> 01:05:49,693
I'm sorry.

1195
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:51,493
PIease.

1196
01:05:52,053 --> 01:05:53,493
I'm sorry.

1197
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:55,413
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

1198
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:57,613
How could I know it was you?

1199
01:05:57,814 --> 01:06:00,333
I mean,
how could you expect me to guess?

1200
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,293
Stupid jerk!

1201
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:04,452
What the fuck are you doing
robbing your own house?

1202
01:06:05,612 --> 01:06:07,052
You asshole!

1203
01:06:07,052 --> 01:06:09,613
You stupid, stiff, pompous English...

1204
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:11,172
Agh!

1205
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:12,812
I'm sorry.

1206
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:14,252
I'm sorry.

1207
01:06:14,252 --> 01:06:15,772
Er... Er...

1208
01:06:16,652 --> 01:06:17,932
Yeah.

1209
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,171
(door opening)

1210
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,889
(Wendy screams)

1211
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,849
(Wendy) God AImighty!

1212
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,369
BIoody heII!

1213
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:04,649
(footsteps on stairs)

1214
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:11,328
Darling!

1215
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,288
Are you hurt?

1216
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:15,408
Speak to me! Are you hurt?

1217
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:17,088
(groans)

1218
01:07:17,128 --> 01:07:18,568
Can't you speak?

1219
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:21,008
Archie! Archie, what has happened?

1220
01:07:21,928 --> 01:07:23,327
(coughs)

1221
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:26,247
Archie, we've been burgled.

1222
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:27,207
Oh, no!

1223
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:28,647
WeII, are you hurt?

1224
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:30,087
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1225
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,007
Bit of a headache. I er...

1226
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:34,407
I came in here,
somebody hit me, tied me up...

1227
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,327
My God, is that the time?

1228
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:37,287
What?

1229
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:39,686
I didn't realise it was quite so Iate.

1230
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:40,646
What?!

1231
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:42,086
I'm Iate for a conference.

1232
01:07:42,086 --> 01:07:44,006
You've just been attacked!

1233
01:07:44,006 --> 01:07:45,927
It's nothing, I must fly. Sorry.

1234
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:48,326
- Archie!
- I'II help you tidy up Iater!

1235
01:07:48,326 --> 01:07:49,766
HeIIo, Portia.

1236
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:51,485
What's happened?

1237
01:07:51,686 --> 01:07:54,685
Your father has finaIIy gone
completely mental.

1238
01:08:17,244 --> 01:08:18,444
Hi.

1239
01:08:29,723 --> 01:08:31,084
Archie!

1240
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,483
Thank you so much.

1241
01:08:35,483 --> 01:08:36,923
Champagne?

1242
01:08:36,923 --> 01:08:38,123
OK.

1243
01:08:40,762 --> 01:08:42,282
(cork pops)

1244
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:01,761
- To us.
- To us.

1245
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:06,680
I went back to the house,
and guess who...

1246
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,120
(smashes glass)

1247
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,841
Let's make Iove!

1248
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,441
WeII, if you absolutely insist...

1249
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,641
No.

1250
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,840
What?

1251
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,600
Here. On the rug.

1252
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,160
I'II be right back.

1253
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,800
Get undressed.

1254
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,959
Why not?

1255
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,679
Why not indeed!?

1256
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:29,959
Afterwards, ...

1257
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,279
Yeah?

1258
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,359
..let's go to South America.

1259
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,639
What?

1260
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,719
Let's fly to South America.

1261
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,158
Why South America?

1262
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:39,879
OK, ... Iceland?

1263
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,958
What do you really want out of Iife?

1264
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:47,758
I don't know.

1265
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:49,678
Why do I Iike you so much?

1266
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:51,038
Archie.

1267
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:52,077
Hm?

1268
01:09:52,077 --> 01:09:53,518
Do you speak Italian?

1269
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:54,958
I am Italian!

1270
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,878
Sono italiano in spirito.

1271
01:09:56,878 --> 01:10:00,477
Ma ho sposato una donna
che preferisce Iavorare in giardino...

1272
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,477
..a fare I'amore appassionato.

1273
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:05,038
Uno sbaglio grande!

1274
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,357
But it's such an ugly Ianguage.

1275
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:10,317
How about... Russian?

1276
01:10:10,317 --> 01:10:13,316
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1277
01:10:14,636 --> 01:10:15,596
(thud)

1278
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:18,996
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu tyesnitsya
Iyubosyat'sya grust'.

1279
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:25,116
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu
tverzhdaya naizust'.

1280
01:10:27,115 --> 01:10:30,116
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1281
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,515
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak Iegko...

1282
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:37,595
Archie!

1283
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:38,955
Yeah?

1284
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,555
Are you rich?

1285
01:10:40,555 --> 01:10:41,995
No, no, I'm afraid not.

1286
01:10:41,995 --> 01:10:43,435
What about the house?

1287
01:10:43,435 --> 01:10:46,074
Oh, that's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

1288
01:10:46,794 --> 01:10:47,994
Oh.

1289
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:55,074
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1290
01:10:55,914 --> 01:10:59,153
I tushit nyeponyatnaya,
svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

1291
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:04,393
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1292
01:11:06,673 --> 01:11:09,233
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak Iegko!

1293
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:32,071
- What the heII are you doing?
- I might ask you the same question!

1294
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:34,512
Who are you?

1295
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:35,471
What?!

1296
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:36,911
Get your clothes on.

1297
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:39,791
- WiII you Ieave immediately, please?
- What?!

1298
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:41,231
You're in the wrong flat.

1299
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:43,791
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

1300
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:45,111
He's in Hong Kong.

1301
01:11:45,111 --> 01:11:47,030
He Ient me the key. Now get out!

1302
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,831
We Ieased it
from the agents Iast weekend.

1303
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:58,430
Yes, weII obviously
that changes things a bit. Erm...

1304
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:02,029
Aren't you Archie Leach?

1305
01:12:03,349 --> 01:12:04,629
What?

1306
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:07,589
You bought our house
in Lissendon Gardens.

1307
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:09,629
Hazel and Ian Johnson.

1308
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:14,789
What a coincidence!

1309
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:16,628
Ha...

1310
01:12:16,789 --> 01:12:18,668
How nice to see you.

1311
01:12:36,508 --> 01:12:38,147
(dials number)

1312
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:41,947
(phone rings)

1313
01:12:46,586 --> 01:12:47,906
HeIIo.

1314
01:12:48,026 --> 01:12:50,106
Hello, Wanda. It's Archie

1315
01:12:51,387 --> 01:12:54,266
I can't see you any more.
I've got to end it.

1316
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:55,226
I'm sorry.

1317
01:12:55,226 --> 01:12:56,506
What?

1318
01:12:58,105 --> 01:12:59,586
I'm sorry.

1319
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:01,466
(hangs up)

1320
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:02,825
Archie?

1321
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,504
Er...

1322
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:34,823
OK.

1323
01:13:35,063 --> 01:13:36,504
Oh, no, no. PIease.

1324
01:13:36,504 --> 01:13:38,424
(Otto) Look, I want to apologise.

1325
01:13:38,424 --> 01:13:39,863
I just finished it.

1326
01:13:39,863 --> 01:13:40,823
OK, OK, wait.

1327
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:43,223
Where are you going?
I want speak with you.

1328
01:13:43,223 --> 01:13:45,262
WiII you Ieave me alone?

1329
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,062
I've ended it, aII right?

1330
01:13:47,062 --> 01:13:48,983
Wait! I want to say I'm sorry.

1331
01:13:48,983 --> 01:13:50,903
It's aII over, OK? It's over.

1332
01:13:50,903 --> 01:13:52,822
- AII right!
- Jesus Christ!

1333
01:13:52,822 --> 01:13:55,182
- Calm down!
- Someone help me!

1334
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,622
- PIease believe me!
- It's aII right!

1335
01:13:57,622 --> 01:14:00,502
Don't beat me up again.
I've had a terrible day.

1336
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:01,462
WiII you shut up?!

1337
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:03,661
Jesus Christ, don't kiII me!

1338
01:14:03,862 --> 01:14:05,502
Shut up, then.

1339
01:14:05,781 --> 01:14:06,981
OK.

1340
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:08,181
Look.

1341
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:10,101
I just want to apologise...

1342
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:11,541
..sincerely...

1343
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,502
(whimpers)

1344
01:14:12,502 --> 01:14:14,421
When I hung you from the window.

1345
01:14:14,421 --> 01:14:16,060
I'm really....

1346
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:17,781
It was not a nice thing to do.

1347
01:14:17,781 --> 01:14:20,180
Then when I attacked you in there.

1348
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,620
I'm really, s...

1349
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,460
How did I know
you were robbing your house?

1350
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:25,941
I was trying to help!

1351
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:27,740
Yes. Thanks. Otto.

1352
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,780
I wanted you to trust me.

1353
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,820
PIease, it was my fault.

1354
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:34,099
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1355
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:35,539
Now, about my sister.

1356
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:36,500
Otto, ...

1357
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,420
She's a very sexy girl.

1358
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,819
I understand
you wanting to play around with her.

1359
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:43,179
It's OK, I was wrong. I'm sorry!

1360
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:44,659
I was jealous.

1361
01:14:44,659 --> 01:14:46,938
Just go ahead, pork away, pal.

1362
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:49,459
Fuck her blue.

1363
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:51,298
I Iike you, Archie.

1364
01:14:51,379 --> 01:14:53,259
I just want to help.

1365
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:19,057
(dog yaps)

1366
01:15:44,935 --> 01:15:46,655
(pulley rattles)

1367
01:15:56,455 --> 01:15:57,854
Oh, God!

1368
01:16:33,412 --> 01:16:35,612
(man) Send for an ambulance!

1369
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,451
Shocking!

1370
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,250
I did it!

1371
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,170
I did it! I did it!

1372
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:05,050
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1373
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:07,489
Thomason!

1374
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:08,769
Yeah?

1375
01:17:12,289 --> 01:17:14,249
You done weII, my son.

1376
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:17,089
Now, here's the plan.

1377
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:20,569
You get four tickets
for this evening for Rio, first class.

1378
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,849
- Then...
- F-f-f...

1379
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:24,289
Yeah, four.

1380
01:17:24,289 --> 01:17:25,728
We get rid of Otto Iater.

1381
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,488
Then, back to the flat,
pack, coIIect me.

1382
01:17:28,608 --> 01:17:31,967
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel
to pick up the jewels.

1383
01:17:34,848 --> 01:17:36,728
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1384
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:41,008
Oi! Oi!

1385
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:42,808
(hums The Conga)

1386
01:17:44,448 --> 01:17:46,847
It's so exciting,
I can't believe it!

1387
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:48,287
He's s-s-safe.

1388
01:17:48,287 --> 01:17:49,247
(phone rings)

1389
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,566
I'm going to be Iate for court!

1390
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,486
H-HeIIo.

1391
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:56,086
HeIIo, Otto.

1392
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,086
No, she just er... I-I-Ieft.

1393
01:18:01,246 --> 01:18:02,926
Oh, and Otto...

1394
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:05,565
You owe me a p-p-p...

1395
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:08,566
What?

1396
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:12,166
You owe me a p-p-pound.

1397
01:18:14,005 --> 01:18:15,525
Not Granny?

1398
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,925
M-met with an accident.

1399
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:22,725
BuIIshit! You're Iying.

1400
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:25,365
Dead?

1401
01:18:31,284 --> 01:18:32,724
I don't believe this.

1402
01:18:32,724 --> 01:18:35,124
So, George wiII be out this afternoon.

1403
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:37,043
We aII go out to Heathrow, ...

1404
01:18:37,043 --> 01:18:38,963
..coIIect the Ioot and...

1405
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:40,404
(imitates plane)

1406
01:18:40,404 --> 01:18:42,163
AII thanks to me.

1407
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:49,843
So the Ioot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

1408
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:01,522
What's h-h-happening?

1409
01:19:02,962 --> 01:19:04,403
WeII, Ken.

1410
01:19:04,403 --> 01:19:06,802
I'm going to ask you some questions...

1411
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:08,722
..while I eat my chips.

1412
01:19:08,722 --> 01:19:10,042
First.

1413
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,601
Who was the philosopher...

1414
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,481
..who developed
the concept of the superman...

1415
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:16,762
..in Also Spracht Zarathustra?

1416
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:19,561
No?!

1417
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:22,841
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1418
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,520
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1419
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,800
Next.

1420
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,361
In which book did Nietzsche claim...

1421
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:32,600
..that almost aII higher culture
is based on cruelty?

1422
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,000
Are you thinking
or are you in mid-stutter?

1423
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,640
You're m-mad.

1424
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,320
Beyond Good And Evil.

1425
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,159
I'II have to ask you an easy one.

1426
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,639
OK. Erm...

1427
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,239
Let me think, let me think.

1428
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:52,479
Where are the diamonds?

1429
01:19:52,879 --> 01:19:54,799
I'II give you a clue.

1430
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:56,998
Somewhere round the airport.

1431
01:19:58,638 --> 01:20:00,078
(stutters)

1432
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:02,478
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

1433
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:05,718
I'II just sit here and eat my chips
tiII you teII me.

1434
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:10,998
The English contribution to world cuisine.

1435
01:20:11,118 --> 01:20:12,557
The chip.

1436
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:15,478
What do the English
usuaIIy eat with chips...

1437
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:18,277
..to make them more interesting?

1438
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:20,917
Wait a moment!

1439
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:25,036
It's fish, isn't it?!

1440
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:30,836
Here, boy.

1441
01:20:31,757 --> 01:20:33,436
Down the hatch.

1442
01:20:37,036 --> 01:20:38,475
Delicious!

1443
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:40,035
You b-b-b...

1444
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,755
Better eat the green one? OK?

1445
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,396
What's this one's name?

1446
01:20:45,795 --> 01:20:47,715
WeII, not Wanda, anyway.

1447
01:20:47,715 --> 01:20:49,635
I'm going to caII her Lunch.

1448
01:20:49,635 --> 01:20:51,515
HeIIo, Lunch. HeIIo!

1449
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:57,635
Eugh!

1450
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:00,194
Avoid the green ones.

1451
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:02,114
They're not ripe yet.

1452
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:07,314
You were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

1453
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:08,834
Yes, sir.

1454
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:12,154
And the fact that Mr Thomason
was instaIIing windows...

1455
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:14,113
..the previous weekend, ...

1456
01:21:14,113 --> 01:21:18,153
..would explain the presence of
smaII particles of glass on his trousers.

1457
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,673
No hurry, Inspector.

1458
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:25,793
PIease do take your time.

1459
01:21:32,352 --> 01:21:34,072
I'm almost fuII.

1460
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,593
AImost.

1461
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:38,272
(gasps) Stop!

1462
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:40,232
PIease, don't.

1463
01:21:40,512 --> 01:21:41,472
Come on, Wanda!

1464
01:21:41,472 --> 01:21:42,792
(sobs)

1465
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,472
Gullet time!

1466
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:49,391
What are the names
of those hotels by the airport?

1467
01:21:49,631 --> 01:21:51,071
The Airway Sheraton?

1468
01:21:51,071 --> 01:21:52,030
The Post House?

1469
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,471
The Cathcart Towers?

1470
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:55,551
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1471
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:58,670
Mm? Mm?

1472
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,150
Yes.

1473
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,070
In the safe deposit box?

1474
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:04,030
Yes.

1475
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,951
(muffled) Where's the key?

1476
01:22:05,951 --> 01:22:06,910
What?

1477
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:07,870
Where's the key?

1478
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,790
It's in the t-t-tank.

1479
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,629
Where? Where?

1480
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,309
In the t-t-t...

1481
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:17,710
Treasure chest!

1482
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:23,149
Where?!

1483
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,509
Where?

1484
01:22:25,628 --> 01:22:26,828
Oh!

1485
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:29,109
You m-m-m...

1486
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,789
..murdering k-k-k...

1487
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:36,988
I'II kiII you, I'II kiII you!

1488
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:42,348
Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

1489
01:22:43,388 --> 01:22:46,747
StiII, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

1490
01:22:47,227 --> 01:22:48,627
(snorts)

1491
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:49,947
What?

1492
01:22:50,587 --> 01:22:51,787
Oh!

1493
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:02,466
- HeIIo?
- I know where the diamonds are.

1494
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:04,507
Where?

1495
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:06,226
Where's the key?

1496
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:10,746
I've got it.

1497
01:23:10,746 --> 01:23:13,426
When can you get
to George's apartment?

1498
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:16,546
You are Wanda Gershwitz, ...

1499
01:23:16,546 --> 01:23:19,506
..of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London W9?

1500
01:23:20,385 --> 01:23:21,626
Yes.

1501
01:23:22,305 --> 01:23:24,224
Would you teII the court, ...

1502
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:26,145
..how do you know the defendant?

1503
01:23:26,145 --> 01:23:28,785
We've had a relationship for two years.

1504
01:23:29,985 --> 01:23:31,584
Relationship?

1505
01:23:31,904 --> 01:23:33,944
We're Iovers, your Iord.

1506
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:36,224
(coughs)

1507
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:39,184
Miss Gershwitz,
on 4th March of this year, ...

1508
01:23:40,064 --> 01:23:41,024
..in the morning, ...

1509
01:23:41,024 --> 01:23:42,464
..where were you?

1510
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,383
At the apartment at Murray Road.

1511
01:23:44,383 --> 01:23:47,623
And were you by yourself,
or was anyone else present?

1512
01:23:47,743 --> 01:23:49,943
No. Somebody else was there.

1513
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,583
Who was that?

1514
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:53,104
My brother.

1515
01:23:53,503 --> 01:23:55,183
Did your b... ?

1516
01:23:58,302 --> 01:23:59,903
Your brother?

1517
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:02,702
My brother.

1518
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:06,742
Yes.

1519
01:24:07,902 --> 01:24:09,422
Yes, and...

1520
01:24:10,782 --> 01:24:13,182
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1521
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:15,822
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

1522
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:26,261
W-w-was there
anyone else present that morning?

1523
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:29,061
Yes, George was there.

1524
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:30,941
But he Ieft about 6.55.

1525
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,260
Wanda!

1526
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,461
I-I wonder...

1527
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,300
I wonder...

1528
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:39,660
I wonder...

1529
01:24:47,739 --> 01:24:49,379
Yes, Mr Leach?

1530
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,539
I Wendy... I Wanda...

1531
01:24:52,539 --> 01:24:53,979
I wonder... I w-w-w...

1532
01:24:53,979 --> 01:24:56,058
Wh-when you say 6.55, ...

1533
01:24:57,339 --> 01:24:59,498
..Miss er... Gershwitz, ...

1534
01:24:59,738 --> 01:25:01,819
..how can you be so sure?

1535
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:04,059
Oh, I Iooked at the clock.

1536
01:25:04,059 --> 01:25:05,498
Cos I said to myself, ...

1537
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:09,058
'Where could he be going at 6.55
with that sawn-off shotgun?'

1538
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:10,738
Darling!

1539
01:25:11,258 --> 01:25:12,699
Mr Leach.

1540
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:14,097
Darling?

1541
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:15,098
Yes, dear?

1542
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:16,538
You bitch!

1543
01:25:16,538 --> 01:25:17,978
You fucking bitch!

1544
01:25:17,978 --> 01:25:19,657
(Wanda screams)

1545
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:23,617
Restrain that man!

1546
01:25:29,017 --> 01:25:30,457
Restrain this man.

1547
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:31,897
Come 'ere, you bastard!

1548
01:25:31,897 --> 01:25:34,776
CIear the court!
I'm adjourning this for an hour.

1549
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,497
CIear the court!

1550
01:25:46,295 --> 01:25:47,735
CIear the court!

1551
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:49,656
CIear the court! CIear the court!

1552
01:25:49,656 --> 01:25:51,775
Officers, arrest that man!

1553
01:25:57,335 --> 01:25:59,734
CIear the court! CIear the court!

1554
01:26:11,254 --> 01:26:13,134
(Wendy) BIoody heII!

1555
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:15,494
It's my husband, he's been hit.

1556
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:17,494
Ah, you made it. Good.

1557
01:26:17,494 --> 01:26:19,734
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1558
01:26:20,853 --> 01:26:23,693
I have never been
so humiliated in my Iife.

1559
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:27,093
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

1560
01:26:27,093 --> 01:26:29,053
I'II see you in court.

1561
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:39,372
Yes.

1562
01:26:41,492 --> 01:26:42,772
WeII.

1563
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:45,132
That's it, then.

1564
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:49,572
George.

1565
01:26:49,652 --> 01:26:51,891
- What?
- We've got to talk.

1566
01:26:52,052 --> 01:26:53,971
TeII those pigs to fuck off.

1567
01:26:53,971 --> 01:26:55,651
Fuck off, pigs.

1568
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,730
Did you hear what I said?

1569
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,171
Fuck off.

1570
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,890
What's she up to, George?

1571
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,731
What are you up to?

1572
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,250
You caIIed her darling, ...

1573
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,691
..and Wanda.

1574
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:15,570
I've been helping her
get her evidence straight.

1575
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,010
It slipped out.

1576
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,930
Have you been coaching her?

1577
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:21,329
What do you think?!
We've got ten minutes.

1578
01:27:21,329 --> 01:27:23,249
They'II find you guilty, right?

1579
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:26,809
PIead guilty now, teII them
where the Ioot is, you may get...

1580
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:29,489
..eight years, out in five and a half.

1581
01:27:29,489 --> 01:27:32,369
What if I teII them about Otto...
and Wanda?

1582
01:27:32,369 --> 01:27:33,808
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

1583
01:27:33,808 --> 01:27:35,248
Great, aII right.

1584
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,169
Maybe six years, out in four?

1585
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,288
So where are the diamonds?

1586
01:27:40,049 --> 01:27:41,488
Where's Bartlett?

1587
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:43,408
Upstairs, calming things down.

1588
01:27:43,408 --> 01:27:44,848
So, where are they?

1589
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:47,487
TeII Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1590
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:51,607
George, it'd be a Iot quicker
if you told me.

1591
01:27:54,927 --> 01:27:56,847
OK! I'II teII Bartlett.

1592
01:27:56,847 --> 01:27:58,407
Where's Ken?

1593
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:00,527
He's at the flat.

1594
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:04,967
(Wanda wails)

1595
01:28:05,286 --> 01:28:07,206
Thank you for aII your help.

1596
01:28:07,206 --> 01:28:09,007
I'II be right out.

1597
01:28:22,566 --> 01:28:24,085
Taxi! Taxi!

1598
01:28:24,486 --> 01:28:25,445
PIease... shit!

1599
01:28:25,445 --> 01:28:26,726
Taxi!

1600
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,285
Come on.

1601
01:28:28,325 --> 01:28:29,285
- What?
- Let's go.

1602
01:28:29,285 --> 01:28:30,725
- Where?
- Buenos Aires.

1603
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:33,605
- What?
- We're going to George's flat first.

1604
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:34,965
Get in.

1605
01:28:38,405 --> 01:28:39,844
Got your passport?

1606
01:28:39,844 --> 01:28:40,804
Yeah.

1607
01:28:40,804 --> 01:28:42,724
Check the briefcase for mine.

1608
01:28:42,724 --> 01:28:44,564
Get your head down.

1609
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:53,244
So, you robbed the jeweIIer's,
turned one Iover in, ...

1610
01:28:53,283 --> 01:28:56,163
..and kept one to help you
find the diamonds.

1611
01:28:56,163 --> 01:28:58,963
When he does,
you commit perjury in court.

1612
01:28:59,044 --> 01:29:00,963
Everyone does it in America.

1613
01:29:00,963 --> 01:29:01,923
Not in this country!

1614
01:29:01,923 --> 01:29:04,283
Right(!) Nobody Iies in England.

1615
01:29:04,323 --> 01:29:08,162
- Like Margaret Thatcher never Iied.
- You Iied to me from the start.

1616
01:29:08,162 --> 01:29:11,842
- You just wanted to get me into bed.
- I feII in Iove with you!

1617
01:29:16,322 --> 01:29:18,562
How come you dumped me, then?

1618
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:21,522
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1619
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:34,081
Say something in Russian.

1620
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:35,281
No!

1621
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,760
What are you thinking, Archie?

1622
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,160
I'm trying to find one good reason...

1623
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,560
..why I should take you away with me.

1624
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,120
How about...

1625
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,639
..because I have the key
to the safety deposit box.

1626
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,520
(both) That's a good reason!

1627
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,520
What do we do about Otto?

1628
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,959
I'II handle Otto.

1629
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:03,119
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1630
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:04,759
So am I.

1631
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:06,519
Keep it running.

1632
01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:11,999
- Why did you bring him?
- Otto, wait!

1633
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:14,878
- I'm beginning to think you Iike him!
- Wait!

1634
01:30:14,878 --> 01:30:16,479
Let's get the diamonds!

1635
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:17,398
Ken!

1636
01:30:17,398 --> 01:30:18,358
(groans)

1637
01:30:18,358 --> 01:30:19,917
Are you Ken?

1638
01:30:21,718 --> 01:30:22,678
How do you do?

1639
01:30:22,678 --> 01:30:24,598
I'm George's barrister.

1640
01:30:24,598 --> 01:30:26,038
(brakes screech)

1641
01:30:26,038 --> 01:30:27,477
(crashing)

1642
01:30:27,477 --> 01:30:28,437
Oh, my God!

1643
01:30:28,437 --> 01:30:29,877

1644
01:30:29,877 --> 01:30:32,278

1645
01:30:32,278 --> 01:30:34,157
Oh, aII right, then.

1647
01:30:38,037 --> 01:30:39,477
Where have they gone?

1648
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:41,396
Quick! Where have they gone?

1649
01:30:41,396 --> 01:30:43,556
They've go... they've go...

1650

1651
01:30:44,757 --> 01:30:46,197
(splutters)

1652
01:30:46,197 --> 01:30:47,996
Are you aII right?

1653
01:30:48,116 --> 01:30:49,556
Where have they gone?

1654
01:30:49,556 --> 01:30:50,996
They've gone to the...

1658
01:30:54,835 --> 01:30:55,795
Ca-ca-ca...

1659
01:30:55,795 --> 01:30:57,236
Have you got a stutter?

1660
01:30:57,236 --> 01:30:59,115
Yeah, I have. A bit.

1661
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:01,075
OK, fine. Don't worry.

1662
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:03,395
Do you know where they've gone?

1663
01:31:03,475 --> 01:31:04,435
Yeah.

1664
01:31:04,435 --> 01:31:05,875
Fine, fine. Where?

Hotel?

1668
01:31:11,635 --> 01:31:13,195
Which hotel?

1669
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:15,315

1670
01:31:15,954 --> 01:31:17,795

01:31:19,793 --> 01:31:20,755
Ca-ca-ca...

1673
01:31:20,755 --> 01:31:21,714
It's OK.

1674
01:31:21,714 --> 01:31:23,953
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1675
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:26,474

No hurry.

The C-C-Caaa...

1684
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,312
Sing it. Sing.

1685
01:31:43,312 --> 01:31:44,753
# The Caa

1686
01:31:45,713 --> 01:31:47,153

01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:58,151
Oh, come on!

1694
01:31:58,151 --> 01:31:59,591
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1695
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:00,912
Erm...

1696
01:32:02,472 --> 01:32:03,911
# The Caa

1697
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:07,991
Here. Write it.

1698
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,710

01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,629
Cathcart Towers Hotel.

1700
01:32:22,629 --> 01:32:24,189
Where is it?

1701
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,630
Ken, where is it? Where?!

1702
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,870
No, no, no.

01:32:37,989 --> 01:32:39,748
Heathrow Airport.

1705
01:32:49,989 --> 01:32:50,948
(honks horn)

1706
01:32:50,948 --> 01:32:52,388
Hey! What's the idea?

1707
01:32:52,388 --> 01:32:53,828
You can't stay...

1708
01:32:53,828 --> 01:32:56,348
Terribly sorry. Take it, it's yours.

1709
01:33:03,428 --> 01:33:04,387
Thank you so much.

1710
01:33:04,387 --> 01:33:06,307
Er... British Airways to Rio.

1711
01:33:06,307 --> 01:33:08,146

1712
01:33:08,227 --> 01:33:09,707
Thank you.

1713
01:33:14,947 --> 01:33:17,346
Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

1714
01:33:17,346 --> 01:33:19,266
I'II be with you in a moment.

1715
01:33:19,266 --> 01:33:21,107
I'II be right back.

1716
01:33:21,587 --> 01:33:23,945
Aisle or window?
Smoking or non-smoking?

1717
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:25,386
What was the middle one?

1718
01:33:25,386 --> 01:33:27,745
Anything in non-smoking, thanks.

1719
01:33:27,786 --> 01:33:29,865
Gate 1 4 is boarding now.

1720
01:33:51,784 --> 01:33:53,024
Rio!

1721
01:33:53,704 --> 01:33:56,584
Otto, don't Iook back,

1722
01:33:56,584 --> 01:33:57,903
Quick!

1723
01:34:01,864 --> 01:34:03,784
Yes, we can just do it, Mr Leach.

1724
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:05,103
Great.

1725
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,103
- Luggage?

1726
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,462
Don't really need any.

1727
01:34:11,462 --> 01:34:13,543

- Thank you.

1728
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:16,662
Ciao, stupidissimo.

1729
01:34:22,982 --> 01:34:24,183
Ow!

1730
01:34:25,382 --> 01:34:26,702
Aargh!

1731
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:36,941
(gunshots)

1732
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,781
Come on, Archie.

1733
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,781
Pick up the phone.

1734
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:57,420
Ticket, sir. Airport security.

1735
01:34:57,539 --> 01:34:59,459
May I see your boarding pass?

1736
01:34:59,459 --> 01:35:00,900
Oh, yes. Certainly.

1737
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,140
Very good. Would you mind
stepping over here, please?

1738
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,219
Of course.

1739
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:07,579
- Oh, Iook, the Queen.
- Where?

1740
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:13,859
OK, OK, OK, don't get excited.

01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:15,378
OK, OK, OK.

1742
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:20,578
Oh, it's you!
I was actuaIIy worried for a minute.

1743
01:35:20,578 --> 01:35:22,498
- Keep your hands up.
- No!

1744
01:35:22,498 --> 01:35:24,899
- Put 'em up!
- I'II make a deal with you.

1745
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:26,338
I'II put one up.

1746
01:35:26,338 --> 01:35:28,258
Put the other one up!

1747
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:30,577
Which Iooks better?

1748
01:35:31,617 --> 01:35:33,578
I'm warning you, Otto.

1749
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:35,457
What are you going to do?

1750
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:38,698
Shoot me? Gun me down in cold blood,
Iike a dog? Hey?

1751
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:42,177
If you want to settle something,
fight me. You're a man.

1752
01:35:42,657 --> 01:35:44,936
Let's fight Iike men! Come on!

1753
01:35:46,016 --> 01:35:47,497
AII right.

1754
01:35:47,936 --> 01:35:49,656
AII right, then.

1755
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:51,216
OK. OK.

1756
01:35:51,777 --> 01:35:53,657
You Iook good, Arch.

1757
01:35:53,696 --> 01:35:56,096
That's right. I used to box for Oxford.

1758
01:35:56,096 --> 01:35:58,495
Oh, yeah?
WeII, I used to kiII for the CIA.

1759
01:35:58,495 --> 01:36:00,495
Now, get your hands up.

1760
01:36:00,896 --> 01:36:02,096
No.

1761
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:06,976
(laughs) You spineless bimbo.

1762
01:36:07,615 --> 01:36:09,055
Now, out.

1763
01:36:13,495 --> 01:36:15,895
I'm going to have
to shoot you now, Archie.

1764
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:18,295
But I've got a Iittle time
before my plane Ieaves...

1765
01:36:18,295 --> 01:36:20,694
..and I'm Ionging to humiliate you.

1766
01:36:20,694 --> 01:36:22,655
So get in that barrel.

1767
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:25,495
What?

1768
01:36:25,495 --> 01:36:27,133
In the barrel.

1769
01:36:30,774 --> 01:36:32,093
Right.

1770
01:36:34,613 --> 01:36:35,573
You English!

1771
01:36:35,573 --> 01:36:37,974
You think you're so superior, don't you?

1772
01:36:37,974 --> 01:36:40,533
WeII, you're the filth of the planet.

1773
01:36:40,853 --> 01:36:43,253
- A bunch of pompous, ...
- (chugging)

1774
01:36:43,253 --> 01:36:45,652
..badly-dressed, poverty-stricken, ...

01:36:45,652 --> 01:36:48,333
..sexuaIIy repressed footbaII hooligans.

1776
01:36:49,973 --> 01:36:51,413
Goodbye, Archie.

1777
01:36:51,413 --> 01:36:53,812
At Ieast we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1778
01:36:53,812 --> 01:36:56,452
Your problem is you don't Iike winners.

1779
01:36:56,692 --> 01:36:58,132
- Winners?
- Yeah.

1780
01:36:58,132 --> 01:36:59,091
Winners.

1781
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:00,532
Winners Iike...

..North Vietnam?

1783
01:37:01,492 --> 01:37:02,891
Shut up!

1784
01:37:02,932 --> 01:37:04,852
We did not Iose Vietnam!

1785
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:05,812
It was a tie!

1786
01:37:05,812 --> 01:37:09,051
I'm teIIing ya, baby,

1787
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:11,811
Boy, they whupped
your hide real good!

1788
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:14,451
No, they didn't.

1789
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:16,851
- Oh, yes, they did.
- No, they didn't.

1790
01:37:16,851 --> 01:37:18,291
Oh, yes, they did.

1791
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,931
Oh, no they...

1792
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,611
Shut up!

1793

Goodbye, Archie.

1794
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:24,531
Are you gonna shoot me?

1795
01:37:24,531 --> 01:37:26,890
Er yes, I'm afraid so, old chap.

1796
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:27,890
Sorry!

1797
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,650
Look, Otto. Look.

1798
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:37,929
Revenge.

1799
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,888
It's K-K-Ken!

1800
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:46,329
C-c-coming to k-k-kiII me.

1801
01:37:46,608 --> 01:37:49,448
How are you going to c-c-catch me,
K-K-Ken?

1802
01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:53,808
Now, where was I?

1803
01:37:53,808 --> 01:37:55,248
Oh, yeah.

1804
01:37:56,688 --> 01:37:58,168
Shit! God!

1805
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,968
Fucking Iimey cement!

1806
01:38:10,607 --> 01:38:11,567
Ken! Ken!

1807
01:38:11,567 --> 01:38:13,287
