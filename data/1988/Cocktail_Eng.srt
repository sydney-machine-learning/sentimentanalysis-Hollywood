1
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,857
Come on! Put it to the floor!

2
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,693
Come on! Let's go!

3
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,617
Go, go, go, go.

4
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,085
Here we go.

5
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,339
Pull over. Pull over!

6
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,350
Slow down, slow down.

7
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,867
Open up!

8
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,625
Defender of the nation,
I bid thee a fond farewell.

9
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,713
Make a million.
Make a million, buddy.

10
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:59,554
Mike. Lookee there. Look at that.

11
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,640
Look at that.
You see that city out there, kid?

12
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,936
See that big town? One day, we're
gonna own that town, you and me.

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,481
What do you think of that?

14
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,400
Smart kid.

15
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,855
Uncle Pat. Be careful
or you'll throw that back out again.

16
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,526
Don't worry. I can handle it.
So, home from the wars?

17
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
How are you?

18
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,324
Fine. Servicing all the widows
in the neighbourhood.

19
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,951
Same old Uncle Pat.

20
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:51,416
Flat beer from rusty pipes.
If you only knew how I missed it.

21
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,003
You've changed, but they
didn't beat the wise guy out of you.

22
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,006
- No chance of that.
- I saved the apartment for you.

23
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,384
Sublet it to two yuppies
who loved your mother's furniture.

24
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,636
They said it was quaint.

25
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,222
I remember the day
they came to repossess it.

26
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,225
Yeah, well.
So, what are you gonna do now?

27
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,022
Make a million.

28
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,275
Meanwhile, I'll ask McDougal
to give you a job.

29
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,985
No way.

30
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,154
It was good enough
for your old man.

31
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,697
So was arthritis.

32
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,784
He supported a family,
like you'll have to do.

33
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,162
No. Not me.
I am not falling into that trap.

34
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,123
Every man wakes up one morning
with a wife and kids.

35
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,126
Where did they come from?
They weren't there before.

36
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:40,131
That's 'cause most things in life,
good and bad, just happen to you.

37
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,509
I'll make things happen for me.

38
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,679
Sure you will.
That's a buck for the beer.

39
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,102
What? Your nephew comes home

40
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,605
from serving his country,
and doesn't even rate a free beer?

41
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,982
You don't get rich
giving things away.

42
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,442
How do you get rich?

43
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,529
I'll give you your first lesson,
on the house.

44
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,825
I've been here 25 years,
never bought a drink. Right, Eddie?

45
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,119
Yeah, I can testify to that.

46
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:13,081
In 1969,
the Mets won the World Series.

47
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:17,293
Eddie starts pounding on the bar,
demanding a round on the house.

48
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,089
"Drinks for everybody," he says.
Tell him what I did, Eddie.

49
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,468
He whacked me with a club. Almost
knocked the eye out of my head.

50
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,095
That's how you make money?

51
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,599
You outwork, outthink, outscheme and
outmanoeuvre. You make no friends.

52
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,478
Trust nobody. And make sure
you're the smartest guy in the room

53
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,523
when the subject of money comes up.

54
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,610
I don't know, Uncle Pat. It doesn't
sound like too much fun to me.

55
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,947
Fun? You want fun,
you go play at the beach.

56
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,034
- I think I'll try the city first.
- Well, here.

57
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:55,415
- This will get you there in style.
- $10. Uncle Pat!

58
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,126
Buy Eddie a binge on me.

59
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,255
Eddie,
you got to be quicker than that.

60
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,952
I've always wanted to work
on Wall Street. I read the "Journal".

61
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:38,500
- I'll do what it takes to succeed.
- All our professionals have degrees.

62
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,377
I catch on quick.

63
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,504
- You're wasting your time.
- No.

64
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,507
- We're not interested.
- Guy like you? Advertising.

65
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,634
I have a feel for advertising.

66
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,719
I can tell what's wrong with an ad.

67
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,639
Mr Flanagan,
we need solid credentials.

68
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,934
- A marketing degree is prerequisite.
- Try the networks.

69
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,436
In the army,
I worked in communications.

70
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,189
We need someone
who can hit the ground running.

71
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,067
- Sorry.
- Maybe in six or eight months.

72
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,153
- Pursue other avenues.
- You should re-enlist.

73
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,615
I believe in positive thinking.
Never quit. Never say die.

74
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,702
I want to be part of the team.
What do you think?

75
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,913
Your résumé is completely inadequate.

76
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,041
- I'll start at the bottom.
- You're aiming too high.

77
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,669
- I'll do anything.
- You don't have experience.

78
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,087
I need a job.

79
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,715
- We value education.
- We require a degree.

80
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,008
Go to college.

81
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,753
- Bar's closed, pal.
- I'm looking for the manager.

82
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,590
What's wrong?
Find a hair in your quiche?

83
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,635
No. I'm looking for a job.

84
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,972
I see. You want to put a hair
in somebody else's quiche.

85
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,391
Just get canned?

86
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,394
I'm looking for something better.

87
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,358
Coughlin's Law. Anything else
is always something better.

88
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,860
Coughlin's Law?

89
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,905
Douglas Coughlin. Logical negativist.

90
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,741
Flourished in the last part
of the 20th century,

91
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:39,621
propounded a set of laws that
the world ignored, to its detriment.

92
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,747
Me.

93
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,960
- Ever work behind a bar?
- My uncle's in the business.

94
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,755
You know how to make
a Red Eye, Mr...?

95
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,259
Brian Flanagan. No. I'm sorry.
I haven't had the pleasure as yet.

96
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,304
What about a vodka martini
with a Pernod float?

97
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm a fast learner.

98
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,269
Ever throw a 400lb psychopath
out of a bar?

99
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,355
Guess I could if I had to.

100
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,900
Or a 100lb ballerina
who's been speeding for three days?

101
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,321
Just open the door and let her
pirouette out in the street?

102
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,574
These are some of the tasks
you'll be asked to perform.

103
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,036
This is the Upper East Side,
the saloon capital of the world.

104
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,665
Are you ready for the big time,
young Mr Flanagan?

105
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,669
I think I can handle it.

106
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,050
- Get your act together!
- Vodka and Rose's.

107
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,971
Come on! I got four people waiting.
I'm not going back with three drinks.

108
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,431
I know. It's coming.

109
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,101
Absolut on the rocks, Gilbey's
and tonic and a Velvet Hammer.

110
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,187
- I didn't order that.
- A Molson and a Cuba Libre.

111
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,649
- What was that?
- A Molson and a Cuba Libre.

112
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,574
If you want to sit in the water,
go to Coney Island.

113
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,995
- You want me to bite the top off?
- This has got recipes.

114
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,122
Orderina! Cuba Libre!

115
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,916
- Can I have a glass of water?
- He can't make it.

116
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,544
- Where's my Jim Beam on the rocks?
- Coming.

117
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,006
I'm not leaving
till I get my Cuba Libre.

118
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,550
Excuse me, could I have an Orgasm?

119
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,511
This isn't what I ordered.

120
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,724
You bitch! Why didn't you just
tell me it was a rum and Coke?

121
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,893
Can I have what I ordered?

122
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,895
- An Angel Tit.
- A white wine.

123
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,855
- Pink Squirrel.
- A Friar Tuck.

124
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,191
- A Dingaling.
- A white wine.

125
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,193
- Pink Squirrel!
- Angel Tit!

126
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,987
- Dirty Mother!
- Can I have what I ordered?

127
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,114
Alright!

128
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,201
- What was it that you ordered?
- A Martini.

129
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,078
What's in that?

130
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,929
- You get 10% from the waitresses.
- I don't deserve it.

131
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,973
You schmuck,
you get money from girls every day?

132
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,354
- I'm sorry I called you a bitch.
- Why? I am a bitch.

133
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:16,277
- Got yourself a new disciple?
- Goodnight, my beautiful.

134
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,446
Frogman.

135
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,242
Anyone that can get money
out of her is a major talent.

136
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,286
Come back next Thursday.
I've got five shifts open.

137
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,288
You're offering me a job?

138
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,875
The waitresses hate me.

139
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,799
Wait until you've given them crabs.
Then you'll really know hatred.

140
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,820
Today, we'll discuss the demand
for money by focusing

141
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,405
on the money multiplier.

142
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,742
We add increases in currency
along the whole system,

143
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,286
which gives
the sum of an infinite series.

144
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,831
Adding together increases
in currency and deposits

145
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,500
they add up to one plus CU
over CU plus RE.

146
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,713
That, simply stated, is
the money multiplier. Now, moving on.

147
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,632
The essential technique
of bartending.

148
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,470
Less is more. The less you pour,
the more you score.

149
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,889
The boss does better, we do better.

150
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,349
And the customer?

151
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,102
Think of him as a hurdler thinks
of a hurdle. A means to an end.

152
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,648
We dazzle him with ice work,
we baffle him with bottle work.

153
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,527
There are many ways to fool
a customer. The short pour.

154
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,239
The long pour.

155
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,702
The ice mountain, the spring thaw,
the speed-rack shuffle, the hot shot.

156
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,288
You will learn them all.

157
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,415
Yes, Obi-Wan.

158
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,501
Both hands, ladies, come on.

159
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,545
Ready? One, two, three, let go!

160
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,096
- What does it mean?
- What does it mean? Nothing!

161
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,556
Nothing? Alright!

162
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,733
- Very sophisticated, man.
- What a good jolt!

163
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,825
You got it going.

164
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,748
Let's go with the drinks.
I'm making money tonight.

165
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,042
Let's make some money for a change.

166
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,379
Ice!

167
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,756
- Catch!
- Thank you.

168
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,759
I guess that's what you learn
in college, right?

169
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,861
Don't forget my beers, Bri.

170
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,991
Missed me!

171
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,496
The name of the game is woman.
Little darlings come in here panting,

172
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:18,501
their hearts pitter-patting for the
handsome, all-knowing bartender.

173
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:23,006
In their wake, slobbering geeks
with one hand on their crotches

174
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,425
and the other hand on their wallets.

175
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,554
You get the women, you get the
bucks. And boy, you've got them.

176
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,140
Buttons were popping,
skirts were rising.

177
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,895
When you can see the colour of their
panties, you know you've got talent.

178
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,814
Stick with me, son.
I'll make you a star.

179
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:44,611
Thanks, but I gotta be honest.
This is just a part-time gig for me.

180
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,781
I'm in the business programme,
City College.

181
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,116
A seeker of wisdom and truth.

182
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,205
You couldn't find a better
work-study programme than here.

183
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,542
- To a future leader of America.
- I'll stick with the brew.

184
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,338
Beer is for breakfast here.
Drink or be gone.

185
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,683
I realise I've got a class

186
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,851
of budding capitalists here,

187
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:21,481
that most of you are seeking
the fast-track, lovely term,

188
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:26,820
to a career in investment banking, or
some other socially useful pursuit.

189
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:32,117
Nevertheless, certain antiquated
skills, such as reading and writing,

190
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,661
remain a part of the curriculum.

191
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:40,208
So, for your first assignment, I want
you to write your own obituaries.

192
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:45,255
Not that I wish you were dead.
At least not yet, anyway.

193
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,299
"Brian Flanagan."

194
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,221
"Senator Brian Fla...
Billionaire governor Brian Flanagan

195
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,766
whose self-propelled meteoric rise
to wealth and fame

196
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,603
would have made
even JD Rockefeller envious,...

197
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,733
..died early yesterday morning
at the age of 99,

198
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:09,362
while bedding his 18-year-old
seventh wife, Heidi,

199
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,032
who is recovering from exhaustion

200
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,660
and will be unable
to attend the funeral."

201
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,249
For your mid-term paper,

202
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,920
I want you to select a business
in which you are interested

203
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,716
and to prepare a complete plan
for its development.

204
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:36,389
You should include capitalisation,
administrative costs,

205
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:42,896
income prospectus, marketing,
cost analysis.

206
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,901
Blue shirt, fifth row, wake up!

207
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,074
Light dawns on Marble Head.

208
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,410
Where was I?

209
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,208
I have got serious fuck-me eyes
coming over here.

210
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,795
Stay in formation. Her old man's
coming in right behind her.

211
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,031
Time.

212
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,043
Brian? The bottle.

213
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,590
Brian? Try and make it
by closing, will you?

214
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,384
I'm doing the best I can, OK?

215
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,391
Sexual frustration.

216
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:49,814
I asked you to prepare a business
plan, a seemingly simple assignment,

217
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:54,778
and yet one word describes
your papers. Bankrupt!

218
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,113
Bankrupt.

219
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,325
A word some of you
will know well in the future.

220
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,161
Like Mr Ron LeMaster.
Where is Ronnie LeMaster?

221
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,248
Yes, our cosmetics magnate
who hopes to make his fortune

222
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,793
selling make-up for pets.

223
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,547
Fetch, Ronnie, fetch. Good boy.

224
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,884
And my own personal favourite,
Mrs Sheila Rivkin.

225
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,928
Oh, my God, he's got my paper.

226
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,640
Mrs Rivkin has spent 20 years
burning her husband's dinners,

227
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,769
but now wants to become the
Donald Trump of the cookie business.

228
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,898
You.
You have something to contribute?

229
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,442
I said it wasn't worth
getting upset about.

230
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,486
What's your name?

231
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,073
- Brian Flanagan.
- Speak up. Let the class hear you.

232
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:46,329
- Brian Flanagan.
- Yes, Mr Flanagan. Let us see.

233
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:51,835
Yes, Mr Flanagan is determined
to revolutionise the bar business,

234
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,630
by franchising his version
of the local New York tavern

235
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,258
to every suburban shopping mall
in America.

236
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:03,596
Tell me, Mr Flanagan, do you intend
to provide the smell of stale beer?

237
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,893
Or perhaps a surly bartender and
three boring drunks to each outfit?

238
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,063
I don't know.
Are you looking for another job?

239
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:18,153
A diamond in the rough.
The dreamer who can't take criticism.

240
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,990
Not from a guy who hides here 'cause
he can't hack it in the real world.

241
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,535
OK, Flanagan,

242
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,956
let's see how well you hack it in the
real world with an F in this course.

243
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,708
F.

244
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:38,256
Not a goddamn thing
any one of those professors says

245
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,383
makes a difference on the street.

246
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,428
If you know that,
you're ready to graduate.

247
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,270
Maybe I'm just too old
to be a student.

248
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,444
Christ.

249
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,240
I've got to find something to do.

250
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,659
Relax. You're in the perfect job.

251
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,914
There's no better way to make it
than behind three feet of mahogany.

252
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:15,794
Within a square mile is the greatest
concentration of wealth in the world.

253
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:22,634
Yes, but how is a bartender
going to get his hands on any of it?

254
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,055
A bartender is the aristocrat
of the working class.

255
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,141
He can make all kinds of moves
if he's smart.

256
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:35,146
There are investors out there.
There are angels. There are suckers.

257
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,359
There are rich women
with nothing to do with their money.

258
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:45,407
You can stand in here and be struck
by lightning. I've seen it happen.

259
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,539
- Shall I continue?
- Oh, please do.

260
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,543
Chantilly lace
And a pretty face

261
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,587
And a ponytail just hanging down

262
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,173
A wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk

263
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,759
Makes the world go round

264
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,554
Ain't nothing in the world
like a big-eyed girl

265
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,557
To make me act so funny
Make me spend my money

266
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,769
Feel real loose
Like a real live goose

267
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,522
Oh, baby, that's what I like

268
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,736
It's not dignified to get this drunk.

269
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,238
- You are in training.
- I'm in training.

270
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,198
- For stardom.
- For stardom.

271
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,492
However liberated this world becomes,

272
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,872
a man will always be judged on the
amount of alcohol he can consume.

273
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:38,793
And a woman will be impressed,
whether she likes it or not.

274
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,213
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna make it.

275
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:47,135
You are. A star never pukes
or passes out in public.

276
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,726
Holy shit!

277
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,271
Are you OK?

278
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,566
You alive?

279
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,036
However,
falling down stairs is allowed.

280
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:25,632
- Sure you don't want a slice?
- For breakfast? You're joking.

281
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,386
- It's better than a Red Eye.
- Not for a hangover.

282
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:34,849
Coughlin's diet:
cocktails and dreams.

283
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,602
That's not a bad name for a joint.

284
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,522
We should think about
setting up our own place.

285
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,065
That takes money.

286
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:47,028
The kind of money your sacred books
dangle, but never deliver.

287
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:51,074
They deliver.
You just got to know how to read.

288
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,955
Come on, we could make a fortune.

289
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,166
That's why you came to New York
and why I left Queens.

290
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,585
Positive thinking.

291
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,798
You can't let a little thing
like cash stand in our way.

292
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:12,137
- Cocktails & Dreams.
- Cocktails & Dreams.

293
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,434
I see it in pink neon.
Blink-blink, dinkety-blink.

294
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:21,104
That is a little corny, isn't it?
But I can live with it.

295
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,274
Yes, but can I live
with young Flanagan?

296
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:29,738
Well,
maybe I could handle a partner.

297
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,158
Alright! 50-50.

298
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:36,661
A partner who knows his place.
70-30.

299
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:43,668
You have your pension to think about,
so I will settle for 60-40.

300
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,131
To health and friendship.

301
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,300
Life and love.

302
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,969
- Our future.
- To our future.

303
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,221
Let's do it. Let's really do it.

304
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,774
Listen,
why the fuck are two stars like you

305
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,859
wasting your talent in this hole?

306
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,028
- A secret admirer.
- I'm serious.

307
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,197
I got the hottest saloon in town.

308
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,701
I want you working for me.
In two weeks you'll be famous.

309
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,912
I've been famous for ten years.
Just give me the money.

310
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,884
CELL BLOCK

311
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,530
I am the world's first yuppie poet.

312
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:39,784
Bullshit! Bullshit!

313
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,246
The poem is entitled
"The Bottom Line".

314
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,206
Stick it in your Volvo!

315
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,959
"Money isn't everything, they say."

316
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,212
"OK, so what is? Sex?"

317
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,256
It's better than sushi!

318
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,592
"Did you ever make love
to a pauper?"

319
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,178
- "Pee-ugh."
- I'd rather hump a camel!

320
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:03,725
"Revolution? It takes money to
overthrow the government, you know."

321
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,268
- That's deep.
- "Art?"

322
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:10,315
"The more it costs, the better it is.
And that's the bottom line."

323
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:17,822
- Who wants a drink?
- Who wants a drink?

324
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:21,868
More poets! More poets! More poets!

325
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,037
We want more!

326
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:40,136
- You like poets?
- Yes, we do!

327
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,430
You want poets?

328
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,892
I am the world's last barman poet.

329
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,938
- Alright!
- Give us a kiss, you sexy beast!

330
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:58,405
I see America drinking
the fabulous cocktails I make

331
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:03,410
America's getting stinking
on something I stir or shake

332
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,579
The Sex On The Beach

333
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,041
The schnapps made from peach

334
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,253
The Velvet Hammer
The Alabama Slammer

335
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,881
I make things with juice and froth

336
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,885
The Pink Squirrel
The Three-Toed Sloth

337
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,764
I make drinks so sweet and snazzy

338
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:28,268
The Ice Tea
The Kamikaze

339
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,730
The Orgasm

340
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,649
Hands off the merchandise.

341
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,111
The Death Spasm

342
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:44,242
The Singapore Sling
The Dingaling

343
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:49,247
America, you're just devoted
to every flavour I've got

344
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:57,922
But if you want to get loaded,
why don't you just order a shot?

345
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,601
Bar's open.

346
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,110
I'd like to try the Orgasm, please.

347
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,697
How many would you like?

348
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,534
- Multiple.
- Multiple?

349
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:31,498
Then why don't we start
with the Turquoise Blue?

350
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,135
Oh, my God.

351
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:30,390
That was fantastic! That was great!

352
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,851
- Let me take your picture.
- What for?

353
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,395
One day,
I'll put you in Rolling Stone.

354
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,480
- Is that right?
- My protégé.

355
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:41,359
That's great. Can you move aside,
though? I can't fit you both in.

356
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,361
Excuse me.

357
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,383
I got to go.

358
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,386
- Tuesday night?
- Tuesday? I'm working.

359
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:54,683
I'll sit at the end of the bar. Isn't
that what bartenders' girlfriends do?

360
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,851
Alright.

361
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,899
- Bye.
- Get in. You'll catch pneumonia.

362
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,538
Get out. Get out of there.

363
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:20,959
Get up, damn it. Get up.

364
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:25,839
- God, look at that clown. Get up.
- Good night, sweet prince.

365
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:31,386
- Looks like one of our customers.
- That bum just cost me 50 bucks.

366
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:34,097
So what's this great idea
I'm here to piss on?

367
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,353
Well,
I have been doing some research

368
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,857
into what it'll cost to set up
Cocktails & Dreams.

369
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,651
If we find the right location,

370
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:51,114
do our own renovation, we can start
it up for as little as $75,000 cash.

371
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,451
Which the Tooth Fairy
will deliver to our doorstep?

372
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,244
No, man.

373
00:33:56,327 --> 00:34:02,083
- Which we make in Jamaica, man.
- Oh, God, Brian.

374
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,920
I like that. Jamaica, south of SoHo.

375
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:10,383
Oh, yeah, man. Very south of SoHo.
The Caribbean. Jamaica, man.

376
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,344
I was there on a shoot

377
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:15,513
and met a bartender
who makes $400 a day.

378
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:19,351
- A day.
- And he didn't have your talent.

379
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,478
- Yeah, man.
- I should hope not.

380
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,689
Winter in the tropics,
spring in New York.

381
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,442
Jet-set bartenders, eh?

382
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:32,322
We can live for peanuts there.
No taxes, cash off the books.

383
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:36,701
- Three seasons, we're in business.
- You want to wait three years?

384
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:39,871
I've told you,
New York is where the angels are.

385
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:43,249
Come on.
This is a real opportunity.

386
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,586
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll have a fantastic time.

387
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,171
Will we?

388
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,259
- Carl, huh?
- Coral. English. Coral.

389
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:54,803
Coral.

390
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,138
Yes.

391
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,768
Why are chicks always named after
inanimate objects?

392
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:04,688
There's nothing inanimate
about Coral.

393
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,065
Hot number, huh?

394
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,775
Yes.

395
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,777
Good shot.

396
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,197
- Ten bucks behind the line?
- Sure. Shoot till you miss.

397
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,409
- Alright.
- Where does Coral live?

398
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:22,247
7 6th Street. She's got a brownstone.
She owns the whole building.

399
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:27,877
You don't think she lives there all
by herself, do you? It's a bit lucky.

400
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,922
- See any pictures?
- Of guys? No.

401
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,469
- That's 30 bucks you owe me.
- Jesus. I know.

402
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,097
The man's on a roll,
ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:42,809
So she's been saving herself
for young Flanagan all these years?

404
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,186
Or maybe she hides the pictures.

405
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,441
Check if her ring finger has
a white circle from her wedding band.

406
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,151
Man, are you paranoid.

407
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,322
It's the difference
between a one-nighter

408
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:59,743
and a relationship with
an unattached millionairess.

409
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:04,289
I'm not thinking about her that way.
This is more than a one-night stand.

410
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:07,751
- She'll do a number on you.
- I appreciate the concern.

411
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,964
That's 50 bucks you owe me.

412
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,633
- 50 bucks.
- 50 bucks.

413
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:20,013
50 bucks says Coral's in the sack
with another guy within a week.

414
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:23,308
That's a bet.

415
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,018
Missed.

416
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,537
- Hi. How are you?
- OK. How are you?

417
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,730
- What will you have?
- A Screwdriver.

418
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,818
I take it back.
You're not going to be famous.

419
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:18,113
Too bad you couldn't keep quiet
about our sex life.

420
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,281
It only gets better.

421
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:29,457
- You made a move on Coral?
- Had to get my money back.

422
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,459
You knew how I felt about her.

423
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:35,296
An assembly-line hump
that does the book on the first date?

424
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,925
I did you a favour. Took her off you
before she twisted your mind.

425
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,013
You fucking son of a bitch.

426
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:47,267
Coughlin's Law: Never tell tales
about a woman. She'll always hear.

427
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,771
- Come on!
- Can't take the truth, eh?

428
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:52,772
Bullshit!

429
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:57,610
It was a cheap shot. Where I come
from, you don't do that to friends.

430
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:01,281
Where you come from,
they're still saluting the flag.

431
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:05,660
And no brawling in here.
And that goes for the help as well.

432
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:08,246
I don't work here any more.

433
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,206
You want to cut me, come on!

434
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,836
You'll thank me for this one day.

435
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,589
The fuck I will!

436
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,365
Buddy.

437
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:27,325
Hey, buddy.

438
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:31,037
The name is not "buddy". It's "pal".

439
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:34,457
The brochure promised me a drink
on the house, pal.

440
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:38,503
- I want one of those orange things.
- Excuse me.

441
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,297
My friend passed out.
Do you have a phone?

442
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,092
No. Excuse me.

443
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:53,018
She was drinking champagne
in the sun.

444
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:54,561
Champagne.

445
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,147
Perfume going in, sewage coming out.

446
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,733
- Is she going to be OK?
- Yeah.

447
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,527
Somebody go to the office
and call an ambulance?

448
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,739
- Sure.
- Just in case. Let's get her up.

449
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:13,830
- The doctor will give her ipecac.
- I don't want any more to drink.

450
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,750
Don't worry. It'll make you better.

451
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,627
- It'll help you throw up.
- I don't want to throw up.

452
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:22,839
Oh, God.
I think l'm going to throw up.

453
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:29,512
- No. I'm alright.
- She can never make up her mind.

454
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:33,767
- Brian, I got to hit the road, man.
- OK, Owen.

455
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,980
Well... Bye.

456
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,942
It has been an adventure.

457
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:48,907
Owen'll take care of you.

458
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,270
- Mark, I haven't forgotten you.
- No problem.

459
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:23,108
Welcome to my most humble,
dishonourable establishment.

460
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:24,818
Thank you.

461
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:28,446
My worthless, useless services
are at your disposal.

462
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,242
I wanted to thank you
for helping out yesterday.

463
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:37,122
- It's alright. How's she doing?
- She has a hangover.

464
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:42,127
Can I buy you a drink?
One of my rum specialities, perhaps?

465
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,628
I'll have a beer.

466
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:44,754
Beer.

467
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,882
My kind of woman.

468
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:54,055
Hey, guys. How you doing?

469
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:55,932
Same, Brian.

470
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,935
It seems like Happy Hour
all day around here.

471
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:02,147
Yes, Happy Hour.
That great American invention

472
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,150
for spending quality time
with spouse, soused.

473
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,278
A bartender with a line
for everything.

474
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,155
The bartender.

475
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:15,201
The highest evolution of the species.
Boozus New Yorkus.

476
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,624
I worked in a circus
before I got this job.

477
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,170
Excuse me.

478
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:57,410
You want to see a grown man
cry like a baby?

479
00:42:57,494 --> 00:43:00,622
Hey, bartender.
You know how to make a Red Eye?

480
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,840
What, no tearful greeting?

481
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,514
Coughlin's Law: Never show surprise.
Never lose your cool.

482
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:22,727
Oh, my sons, my rebellious sons. Tell
your old buddy how great he looks.

483
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:30,276
You look like a guy who dyes his hair
and shaves with a Brillo pad.

484
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,780
A guy who gets an erection
on his birthday if the wind's right.

485
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,450
Isn't this great? Two years apart,
and we flow into the old act.

486
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,953
Please,
stop molesting the customers.

487
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,581
A daiquiri, if you will, bartender.

488
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:49,838
- I taught him everything he knows.
- I doubt that.

489
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:57,053
Don't you waste your loyalty on him.
He'll dump you after Valentine's Day.

490
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:05,812
- Isn't that clever?
- What the hell are you doing here?

491
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:11,359
This lad is the best bartender south
of 1 4th Street. It's his downfall.

492
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:13,945
How is being good at something
your downfall?

493
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:18,199
- Thank you.
- It's not an easy concept to grasp.

494
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:22,871
Take our hero here.
I've never been in this joint before,

495
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:28,501
but I'll bet he's got
a success manual behind the bar.

496
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:31,463
Come on, Flanagan, I know it's here.

497
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:40,138
- Touché.
- Voila.

498
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:43,141
Flanagan's a believer,
always will be.

499
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,643
But the doors are shut
to people like us.

500
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:49,731
- Maybe he wants to open them.
- Then he has to steal the key.

501
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:52,484
Something Coughlin here
has been unable to do.

502
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:56,154
I don't have to. Not any more.
I've had my miracle.

503
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:59,366
Oh, what?
Some alkie remember you in his will?

504
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:04,829
Better. I am in love.

505
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,584
There is my miracle.

506
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,631
Who? Pocahontas over there waiting
for everyone to notice her?

507
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:17,509
How dare you speak that way
about my wife?

508
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:23,973
- Your wife? In your dreams.
- For real.

509
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,976
We are here on our honeymoon.

510
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,103
Sweetheart!

511
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,565
Come hither.

512
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:45,495
- You're married?
- This is true love, young Flanagan.

513
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:49,749
True love with a kicker.
She's got millions.

514
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,961
Where were you? I thought
you'd drowned or something.

515
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:55,213
- No such luck.
- Brian Flanagan.

516
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,757
Kerry Coughlin, the love of my life.

517
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,301
- Hello.
- Hi.

518
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,470
You see before you a changed man.

519
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:06,516
The love of a good woman
has made me see the light.

520
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:24,576
Brian's cute.
How long have you known him?

521
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,745
About ten hours.

522
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:33,960
Excuse me. There you go.

523
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:38,340
I've never seen a club
with such intense dance vibes.

524
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:41,551
Come on,
let's decimate this dance floor.

525
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:48,350
- I don't get the two of them.
- It's simple.

526
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:52,312
She's a little rich chick
whose family owns half of Manhattan.

527
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:56,274
Just to piss them off,
she decided to marry a bartender.

528
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,443
True love.

529
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:00,612
Let's dance.

530
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:29,641
Do you ever have the feeling
that you might meet somebody?

531
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:33,687
You know, when you walk
into some place or something?

532
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,648
Star-crossed lovers syndrome?

533
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:37,982
No.

534
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,488
I had a premonition
that I'd meet somebody here.

535
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,700
Really?
You've still got time, you know.

536
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:50,954
Some woman must have
really done a job on you.

537
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,456
Why does it always
have to be a woman?

538
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,711
It doesn't. Your friend Doug
could have done it to you.

539
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:02,007
What's this?
Immune to Coughlin's fatal charms?

540
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,844
Give him a minute. You'll love him.
All women do.

541
00:48:05,927 --> 00:48:08,013
Well, I'm not like all women.

542
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:11,141
I'll give you that.

543
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,686
Of course,
I'm not like all men either.

544
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:18,940
Yes, you are an original.
Till you prove otherwise.

545
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:24,696
I'd better be careful
not to lose my unique status.

546
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,499
So, is this one-night-stand time?

547
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,419
It doesn't make you a bad person.

548
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:44,132
Do your parents own
half of Manhattan?

549
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:45,467
No.

550
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:51,514
Well, then your virtue's
quite safe with me.

551
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,683
For this evening anyway.

552
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,276
Come on, I'll race you!

553
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,042
Smile.

554
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:07,674
- So this is your profession?
- More like my obsession.

555
00:50:07,757 --> 00:50:11,302
- Does it pay the rent?
- Some day it will.

556
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:15,181
Right now, though,
I'm waiting tables at Jerry's Deli.

557
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:19,352
I know the place.
Home of the famous cement Danish.

558
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:21,604
Yeah, that's the one.

559
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:23,148
Yeah.

560
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,278
- Don't look. It's not done.
- It doesn't look like me.

561
00:50:28,361 --> 00:50:32,699
- It's the real you.
- You've captured my innermost soul.

562
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:36,536
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

563
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:39,831
Shit.

564
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:48,173
We should go on one of those.

565
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,092
Tomorrow?

566
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:56,473
- There's a guy who makes these.
- One guy?

567
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:58,266
He must be exhausted.

568
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,188
Yes, he is. But still he gets up
in the morning, kisses his wife

569
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:08,485
and goes to his factory where he
rips off ten billion of these a year.

570
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:13,281
- This guy's a millionaire.
- And the guy who makes these?

571
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:17,327
How about him? Not to mention
the guy who makes these.

572
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,538
And those wrappers
are made by another guy.

573
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:25,001
And these plastic things
at the end of laces.

574
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:29,506
It's probably got one of those
weird names too, like "flugelbinder".

575
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,675
Flugelbinder. Right.

576
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:36,805
We sit here, and we're surrounded
by millionaires.

577
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:40,934
You rack your brains to come up
with a money-making scheme,

578
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:44,354
and some guy corners
the flugelbinder market.

579
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:48,108
Poor baby. He's frustrated.

580
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:53,780
You get a bar job to keep
your days free for your real gig.

581
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:57,659
After work you're so charged up,
you have a few drinks.

582
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,828
It's party time.

583
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:04,499
Days get shorter, nights get longer.
Before you know it,

584
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:09,337
your life is just one long night
with a few comatose daylight hours.

585
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,427
Stop feeling so sorry for yourself,
Flanagan.

586
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:19,014
Your flugelbinder is out there
waiting to be discovered.

587
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:20,974
Waiting.

588
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:23,643
- You think so?
- I do.

589
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,184
No. Stay.

590
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,353
Stay there.

591
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,923
I wish we could stay here forever.

592
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:20,135
I'd build a little hut
over there on the beach.

593
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:22,053
I'd fish and pick coconuts.

594
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,848
No, I'd do the fishing
and coconut-picking.

595
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:26,182
- No.
- Yes.

596
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:28,685
You'd make thatched skirts
for tourists.

597
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:31,896
Really? Thatch one, purl two?

598
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:36,109
Yeah. And we'd never go home.

599
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:39,779
Our kids would look really great
in dreadlocks too.

600
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,866
Kids?

601
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:59,924
How is it going
with that little blonde chippy?

602
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,219
Why am I always with chippies
and you've got the princess?

603
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,222
That's a question
only you can answer.

604
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,932
This man's phenomenal.

605
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:12,270
In a room full of women, he picks
the poorest and dumbest every time.

606
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:18,109
This man's astounding. His wife
parades half naked on the beach,

607
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:20,320
and he thinks
she's there for the sun.

608
00:55:20,403 --> 00:55:22,489
My wife does not need other men.

609
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:28,161
They say sexual vanity in men over 40
is the first sign of senility.

610
00:55:28,244 --> 00:55:31,039
Please try to keep
your envy in check.

611
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:34,125
- Envy?
- He's my protégé.

612
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:36,294
I taught him all I know.

613
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,797
That and a token
might get me on the subway.

614
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,217
You can take a guy so far,
then it's a question of biology.

615
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,304
- Biology is destiny.
- Ah, the old foolosopher.

616
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:50,684
There are two kinds of people
in this world, workers and hustlers.

617
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,019
Hustlers never work and vice versa.

618
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:56,106
And you, my friend, are a worker.

619
00:55:56,189 --> 00:56:00,694
I've tried to beat that out of him,
but it's in your immigrant blood.

620
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:04,239
Look how tasty your cocktails are,
how clean you keep your bar.

621
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:07,450
You actually take pride in your work.

622
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:10,745
I do not.

623
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:14,124
Is he or isn't he a great bartender?

624
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,292
- The best.
- See? They love you.

625
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:23,008
- I'm not stuck in this gig...
- You're a career proletarian.

626
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:27,053
You've been standing in a puddle
so long, you've got webbed feet.

627
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:31,975
- He gets lucky with a rich chick...
- Lucky, he says? You couldn't do it.

628
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:35,603
I've known this man for three years.
He's not a closer.

629
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:40,275
This place is crawling
with moneyed females.

630
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:45,155
Case in point. Rich and ripe,
and out of your league.

631
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,370
Out of my league? Well, she was
checking me out the other night.

632
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,623
Maybe she had 1 5 minutes to kill.

633
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:01,171
You know what it'd take to score
on a woman like that?

634
00:57:01,254 --> 00:57:04,841
You'd have to get over on her,
her managers, her lawyers,

635
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:07,427
her maid and her tennis coach.

636
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:12,098
I've been training for this
my whole life.

637
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:15,310
Well... 50 bucks...

638
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:19,856
..says you don't even make it
over the bar.

639
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:21,524
Gentlemen.

640
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,610
That's a bet.

641
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:27,030
You guys are in on this. Be cool.

642
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,409
Mademoiselle.

643
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:35,580
- Vodka on the rocks with lime.
- Oh, no. This is the tropics.

644
00:57:35,663 --> 00:57:39,125
- At least try a Jus D'Amour.
- Pardon me?

645
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:43,296
Jus D'Amour. It means juice of love.

646
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,633
It's made with fresh fruit,
right off the vine.

647
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:50,679
And trust me when I tell you
that it is nothing short...

648
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,016
..of spectacular.

649
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:02,065
Excuse me. Do I have "fuck me"
written on my forehead?

650
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:07,570
I can't see a thing
without my contacts.

651
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:11,908
You're full of confidence,
aren't you?

652
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:15,745
Yeah. It kind of makes you curious,
don't it?

653
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:22,877
- "Mighty Casey has struck out."
- Now don't. Game's not over yet.

654
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,798
It wouldn't be any fun if they fell
over with their legs in the air.

655
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:31,761
Bartender?

656
00:58:34,472 --> 00:58:36,349
Excuse me.

657
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,873
You are bad.

658
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:30,505
Hey, Dulcy.

659
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:34,050
Where's Jordan?

660
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:37,762
She left on a flight back to New York
late last night.

661
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,639
What did you do to her?

662
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:06,708
Brian, are you there?

663
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,336
It's Bonnie.

664
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:12,547
- Brian?
- Come in.

665
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:18,636
Hi.

666
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:26,019
- You found my secret hiding place.
- The guys at the bar told me.

667
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:28,271
I've been thinking about you all day.

668
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,232
Yeah?

669
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,693
A plane ride home will cure that.

670
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:36,488
What I got, there ain't no cure for.

671
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:41,743
You can't send me away. I don't know
what will happen to me if you do.

672
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:45,997
My business will go to hell.
I'll start writing bad cheques.

673
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:49,626
- We can't have that, now, can we?
- No.

674
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:55,382
You don't really want me
to go away, do you?

675
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,272
These drinks are going to be
very tasty.

676
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:18,363
Into the market now, are we?

677
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:20,448
What's my greatest talent?

678
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,617
Reading between the lines.

679
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:25,453
And that's what
the market's all about.

680
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:27,122
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

681
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,167
I must admit...

682
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,921
..I never thought
I'd see you set up like this.

683
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:38,133
Don't worry.
I won't forget my close friends.

684
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:44,014
Kerry's old man has just backed me
in Manhattan's most luxurious joint.

685
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,182
We open in a couple of weeks.

686
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:50,228
Come back to New York with us
and I'll make you head bartender.

687
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:54,983
That sounds very nice,
but I've got plans of my own.

688
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:57,569
Like what?

689
01:02:57,652 --> 01:03:02,073
Bonnie's hooking me up with her
business. I'm going back with her.

690
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:04,534
Kept man, eh?

691
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:10,331
You cut that blonde loose. Meanwhile,
your conscience is killing you.

692
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:14,586
If she hadn't left,
you'd be back there begging.

693
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:16,463
You think so?

694
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:20,759
And a bottle of Louis Xlll
says you'll be working for me

695
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:23,011
by St Patrick's Day.

696
01:03:23,094 --> 01:03:25,180
A $500 bottle of brandy.

697
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:28,725
I'll have to take that bet.

698
01:03:45,825 --> 01:03:49,371
Wake up! On your feet! Come on!

699
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,749
One, two, three, four!

700
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:55,251
Work those hips, girls! Come on!

701
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:03,718
Morning, babe. Can you get me
some carrot juice from the fridge?

702
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:07,430
Get some for yourself too.
It's addictive.

703
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,850
Every fucking morning.

704
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:16,064
Just tell him not to make a move
until he's seen our line, that's all.

705
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:18,858
And send Harvey
down to Dallas right away.

706
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:21,027
Yeah.

707
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:24,864
Good, Tony.
Great. You are beautiful.

708
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:30,453
Yeah. OK, I'll be in the office
in 15. Ciao, Tony.

709
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:35,583
- Tony? Tony Scaduto, the salesman?
- Yeah.

710
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,628
- I thought he was in Mexico.
- Just got back Friday.

711
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:43,842
- Then I can go and see him.
- We'll let it wait a smidgen longer.

712
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:46,219
Remember,
you're picking me up at seven.

713
01:04:46,302 --> 01:04:48,680
Wear the pinstripe
we bought last week.

714
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:51,349
OK.

715
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:54,352
Did you tell him
about my marketing ideas?

716
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:58,606
They can't think I'm shoving
my boyfriend down their throat.

717
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,775
What does it matter?
You're the boss.

718
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:05,822
These guys are top salesmen, babe.
I can't treat them like office boys.

719
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:10,368
Listen to me.
You could wait six months,

720
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:13,747
you'd still be the youngest salesman
in the business.

721
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,915
Trust me, baby.

722
01:05:57,957 --> 01:06:00,794
Get that heap out of the way!

723
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:03,463
- How will I get out of here?
- Cool down, buddy.

724
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:07,300
You limo drivers all have
your finger up your ass.

725
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:11,137
- Come on, move!
- Give us a break.

726
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:16,351
- Art.
- Hi.

727
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:19,562
Hello. It's so good to see you.

728
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:21,940
Hello, darling.

729
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:23,817
God, it's been ages.

730
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,529
- Hi. You look fabulous in that coat.
- Thanks.

731
01:06:27,612 --> 01:06:30,115
That colour is gorgeous on you.

732
01:06:30,198 --> 01:06:32,283
Darling?

733
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,416
Take my coat, will you?

734
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:06,985
Bonnie, let's get out of here.

735
01:07:07,068 --> 01:07:09,988
Darling, I think you've had
enough to drink. Brian...

736
01:07:10,071 --> 01:07:13,992
- What is this, musical highballs?
- Come on, heel, boy.

737
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:15,118
Come again?

738
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:17,454
This one isn't party-broken yet.

739
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:20,665
Brian, this is Robert Powell.
He's the sculptor.

740
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,046
- How do you do? Interesting work.
- Thank you.

741
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:30,258
Interesting.
It's very urban in orientation.

742
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:35,972
Robert, tell me. How did you get
the cockroach to stand still?

743
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:38,141
You're drunk.

744
01:07:39,642 --> 01:07:41,686
You're ugly.

745
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:45,440
Brian!

746
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:47,609
Could you hold this, please?

747
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:52,822
I'm OK. Robert...

748
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:59,162
Brian! How could you do this?!

749
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:01,122
Have a nice day.

750
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,469
- The suspense is killing me.
- At least you could apologise.

751
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:17,472
Apologise? Yes.

752
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:20,684
Brian, we have to talk
about this seriously.

753
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:26,189
Talk is overrated
as a means of resolving disputes.

754
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:34,030
I moved my stuff out of your place
this afternoon.

755
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:38,910
I left a can of Spam. I hope
your brewer's yeast doesn't mind.

756
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:41,079
Bastard!

757
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,791
Shit!

758
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:46,960
God, Brian, I'm sorry.

759
01:08:49,045 --> 01:08:54,259
Brian... Listen, baby. I've got
interviews set up for tomorrow...

760
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:58,555
Forget it! I am not a salesman.

761
01:08:58,638 --> 01:09:02,308
I tried to sell out to you,
but I couldn't close the deal.

762
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:06,187
Please.
I don't want to end it this way.

763
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:10,442
Jesus. Everything ends badly,
otherwise it wouldn't end.

764
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:15,363
Believe me, you are going to wake up
in the morning with a sigh of relief.

765
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:17,323
Because I'm not there.

766
01:09:57,864 --> 01:09:59,949
- Waitress.
- One second.

767
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:08,166
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what the specials are, please?

768
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:10,043
What are you doing here?

769
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:14,589
- Thought you'd never see me again?
- Hoped is a better word.

770
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:17,175
- Excuse me.
- I'll be there in a minute.

771
01:10:17,258 --> 01:10:19,469
Miss, we have theatre tickets.

772
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:23,098
You obviously are not here to eat,
so please leave.

773
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:24,849
- Miss.
- Waitress.

774
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:26,351
I'll be there in a minute.

775
01:10:26,434 --> 01:10:28,395
I'm not leaving.

776
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:31,106
Your sexy little smile
won't work this time.

777
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:36,653
- I'm not leaving. That's it.
- You're not leaving?

778
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:39,739
Not until you let me apologise.

779
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:44,035
Did you say you'd like to see
the specials, sir?

780
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,578
I'd like to.

781
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:55,672
- We've been waiting.
- Excuse me.

782
01:10:55,755 --> 01:10:58,758
Today's specials
are meatloaf mozzarella.

783
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:02,012
Chicken a la king.

784
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:06,850
And may I suggest some ketchup
for your fries?

785
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:10,562
Fuck.

786
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,820
Shit.

787
01:11:22,532 --> 01:11:25,535
I'd think twice about ordering
the specials if I were you.

788
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,923
Spare change for my dry-cleaning?

789
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,884
Sorry. Payday's Friday.

790
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:43,261
You wouldn't treat
a stray dog like this.

791
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,847
A stray dog can be loyal.

792
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,183
OK, I'm a rat.
There's no hope for me.

793
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:52,854
But even I have a right to defend
myself. At least to explain.

794
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:55,982
Taxi!

795
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,110
Come on in.

796
01:12:18,004 --> 01:12:21,633
- Is this our waterfall?
- No.

797
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:25,637
- It's terrific.
- Yeah, it's alright.

798
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,223
The name's Mooney, not Monet.

799
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:35,522
So why did you humiliate me
like that in Jamaica?

800
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:38,817
How did I humiliate you?

801
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:43,071
Brian, I was there.
l saw you go off with that woman.

802
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:47,367
You're such an asshole.

803
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:57,210
It's not as bad as it seems.

804
01:12:57,293 --> 01:13:03,466
You see, Doug landed a rich chick.
And he bet me I couldn't do the same.

805
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,345
A rich chick. So you'd go with a
woman just because she had money?

806
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:09,723
No, it's not the money.

807
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:13,560
He bet me that I wasn't good enough
to hustle her.

808
01:13:13,643 --> 01:13:15,812
Hustle her?

809
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:20,066
And I was worth so little to you
that you could take some stupid bet?

810
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:23,862
No. A guy lays down a dare,
you got to take it.

811
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:29,159
How do you think I felt
seeing you go off with some woman

812
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:32,579
- after the time we spent together?
- Hold on a second.

813
01:13:32,662 --> 01:13:36,332
You were pushing me. You were
coming on too strong, too fast.

814
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:40,378
I was pushing you?
You happened to be there too.

815
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:44,299
I thought we had something going.
I didn't play any games with you.

816
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:46,468
I know. I know.

817
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:52,140
I'm sorry. I...

818
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:55,477
I guess I just got spooked.

819
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,230
But now I know I can handle it.

820
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:02,359
You can handle it, huh?

821
01:14:03,693 --> 01:14:05,779
So what if you got spooked again?

822
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:07,947
I won't.

823
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:11,618
- I'll bet I can spook you.
- No way.

824
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,412
I'm pregnant.

825
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:17,749
I'm spooked.

826
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,378
It's mine?

827
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:23,922
I was only asking.

828
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:26,800
You're not going to be
bothered or burdened, OK?

829
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:29,803
You can still go out
and make a million. Don't worry.

830
01:14:29,886 --> 01:14:33,431
I'm not worried.
I mean, I am worried.

831
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:35,600
I don't want to discuss it any more.

832
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,852
- OK.
- Just go.

833
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:41,481
- Why?
- Because I want you to. Just go!

834
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:47,821
You let me come up here
just to kick me out, didn't you?

835
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,003
- Jordan.
- No.

836
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:07,007
Just get out!

837
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:11,761
If this is the way it's going to be,
why did you tell me about the baby?

838
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:16,099
Because I knew it'd be the best way
to get you out of my life.

839
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:44,210
Syracuse trying to stay
within striking distance

840
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,963
of Pittsburgh in the Big East.

841
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:49,549
That's for cigarette change.

842
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:53,803
You hand it to me, it's for change.
Put it on the bar, it's a tip.

843
01:15:55,388 --> 01:15:58,516
- Hey, kid.
- Uncle Pat. Eddie. How are you?

844
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:04,064
- I got a problem. Can we talk?
- Make it fast. I'm real busy.

845
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:10,820
What's the matter?

846
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:17,035
I'm going to be a father.

847
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:20,080
Bar's closed!

848
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:22,957
Finish up.
Come on, hit the road. Let's go.

849
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:25,919
- Eddie, finish up. Everybody out.
- What?

850
01:16:27,545 --> 01:16:31,299
You ought to know better
than come to a bartender for advice.

851
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:35,011
- What do I do about this girl?
- Nothing.

852
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:37,222
What do you mean?

853
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:40,767
She's not trying to shake you down
or make you marry her.

854
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:43,645
You don't care about her. Walk away.

855
01:16:47,232 --> 01:16:49,109
What if I do care about her?

856
01:16:49,192 --> 01:16:51,111
Then you got a problem.

857
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:58,618
Jordan, I just want to talk to you.

858
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:02,831
She's not hiding. She's not home.

859
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:05,709
She's at her parents'.
Go bang down their door.

860
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:10,672
- Do you know where that is?
- Park Avenue, corner of 67th.

861
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,719
- Park Avenue?
- Yeah, Park Avenue.

862
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:25,895
You get here when you say you will,
or you won't work here again.

863
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:29,107
- Excuse me.
- So you'll be here what time?

864
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:33,153
- I don't mean to bother you.
- What time?

865
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:34,696
Hello?

866
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:39,034
- What apartment are the Mooneys in?
- The penthouse. Your name?

867
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:41,745
- Brian Flanagan.
- Are they expecting you?

868
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:43,163
Not exactly.

869
01:17:43,246 --> 01:17:46,624
All visitors have to be announced,
Mr Flanagan.

870
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:01,473
Mr Flanagan,
will you come in, please?

871
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:04,267
- May I take your coat, sir?
- OK.

872
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,857
- Someone will be with you shortly.
- Thank you.

873
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:30,877
I'm Richard Mooney.

874
01:18:32,003 --> 01:18:34,923
- I'm Jordan's father.
- I'm Brian Flanagan.

875
01:18:35,965 --> 01:18:40,095
- I've come to see her.
- She's not here. But come in.

876
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:42,263
I'd like to talk to you.

877
01:18:46,184 --> 01:18:48,061
Sit down.

878
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:56,236
I've certainly heard a lot about you
in the last few days.

879
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:03,326
I don't know what really happened
between the two of you, but...

880
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:08,331
I think you've got some nerve coming
here after what you did to Jordan.

881
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:13,586
I understand that. And I realise
that Jordan is very upset.

882
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:18,508
But if I could talk to her, make her
see I'll stick by her through this.

883
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:21,302
I hope you're not suggesting
you'll marry her.

884
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,560
I'm not sure what we'll do.
We have a lot to talk about.

885
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:30,854
The hell you do.

886
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:32,397
The hell you do!

887
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,484
Look, I know Jordan
a lot better than you do.

888
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:39,404
I've never seen her
as unhappy as she is now.

889
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:43,033
She's just not very wise
in the ways of the world.

890
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:46,703
And now what she needs around her
are people she can trust.

891
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:50,707
- She can trust me.
- She doesn't want to see you.

892
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:52,876
She doesn't want to even talk to you.

893
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:57,505
Wait here for one moment,
will you, please?

894
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,726
- Good afternoon, Miss Mooney.
- Hi.

895
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:17,734
- Mr Mooney, I think I'll just...
- Mr Flanagan, here.

896
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:21,863
- What the hell is this?
- That's for you.

897
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:30,663
$10,000?
Is that all your daughter's worth?

898
01:20:30,747 --> 01:20:35,794
- OK, how much will it take?
- I don't want your goddamn money.

899
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:39,172
You can't buy me
out of Jordan's life.

900
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:41,966
I won't let some bartender
destroy her life.

901
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,386
- That is her choice.
- The hell you say!

902
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:47,097
What is going on here?

903
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,974
- I came here to talk to you.
- If you don't get out...

904
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,769
Dad, I will handle this!

905
01:20:52,852 --> 01:20:57,232
Jordan, the other night
I didn't say the right things.

906
01:20:57,315 --> 01:21:00,402
God knows,
I haven't done the right things.

907
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:03,321
But I think there's a chance for us.

908
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:08,159
There is no us. There are too many
things about us that don't work.

909
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:12,914
What about the baby?
Our kid needs a father.

910
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:16,459
Not one who won't be around
in a year.

911
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:20,547
- With your lifestyle, what kind...
- Dad!

912
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:24,050
Jordan, I want a second chance.

913
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:26,678
No.

914
01:21:26,761 --> 01:21:29,097
I deserve a second chance.

915
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,266
No.

916
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:34,060
How will I know
you're being honest with me?

917
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,187
You're barely honest with yourself.

918
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:42,902
Honest? Why didn't you tell me
you were the original rich chick?

919
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,071
Because you're so hung up on money,

920
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:49,200
I was afraid I'd never know
how you really felt about me.

921
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:52,620
Me.
How you'd really feel about me.

922
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:57,417
See this?

923
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,797
This is your father's idea
of how to get me out of your life.

924
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:11,348
This is how hung up on money I am.

925
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,975
And as for how I feel about you...

926
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:18,480
I guess you'll never know.

927
01:22:34,662 --> 01:22:36,164
Henry, it's cold!

928
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:39,376
- Henry, remember me?
- I'm Bruce Springsteen's cousin.

929
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:43,630
- You look more like his couch.
- Henry, I'm Doug's friend.

930
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:46,841
Mr Coughlin doesn't have friends
on a Saturday.

931
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,937
- Where's Doug Coughlin?
- He's over there.

932
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,855
Hey, you!

933
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:03,358
Doug! Coughlin!

934
01:23:03,441 --> 01:23:05,485
- Doug!
- Flanagan!

935
01:23:05,568 --> 01:23:08,488
My best friend in the world.
My only friend.

936
01:23:08,571 --> 01:23:10,323
Piss off, Henry. It's OK.

937
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,868
It's great to see you,
my only friend. Sit down.

938
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:16,454
Looks like you've got
a lot of friends here.

939
01:23:16,579 --> 01:23:20,333
Proctologist's dream.
Wall-to-wall assholes.

940
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:24,295
- It's great to see you.
- Because I came to pay off my bet.

941
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:27,507
- Brian.
- Kerry.

942
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:33,596
- What are you doing here?
- I came to beg and plead for a job.

943
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,808
It'd be great
to get some talent behind the bar.

944
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:54,826
Let's go somewhere where we can
appreciate this. Come on.

945
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:06,629
What are you doing out here?
Get in there and spend some money.

946
01:24:06,713 --> 01:24:08,923
Keep me in the manner
I'm accustomed to.

947
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:12,677
How are you? Get in there
and spend some money, you two.

948
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:15,263
What do you think of my rowing boat?

949
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:20,143
- Jesus Christ!
- Come aboard, you landlubber.

950
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:26,232
Baccarat crystal.

951
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:29,486
Louis XIII, et voila.

952
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:32,572
Shall we let it breathe?

953
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:38,119
It hasn't breathed in 50 years.
It's dead. Let's just drink it.

954
01:24:50,423 --> 01:24:54,386
- Health and friendship?
- Life and love.

955
01:25:03,019 --> 01:25:08,858
Douglas Coughlin,
your ship has certainly come in.

956
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:14,406
My ship.

957
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:18,660
My ship is going down,
and I'm going down with it.

958
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:21,246
- How is that?
- All this is an illusion.

959
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:25,375
I'm on my arse.
I haven't got a pot to piss in.

960
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:29,879
A hundred grand a week. Painful.

961
01:25:31,172 --> 01:25:35,802
I should have read some of your
sacred books, young Flanagan.

962
01:25:35,885 --> 01:25:40,432
All I know about saloons is how
to pour whiskey and run my mouth off.

963
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:44,269
I knew nothing about insurance,...

964
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:51,317
..or sales tax, or the building code,
or labour costs.

965
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,738
Or the power company,
or purchasing, or linens.

966
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:57,532
Everyone with a hand
stuck it in my pocket.

967
01:25:57,615 --> 01:25:59,534
You must make enough to cover that.

968
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:04,205
If I'd stuck to what I know best,
which is almost nothing.

969
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:09,252
Instead, I put all the cash
into commodities,

970
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:12,589
and blew the fucking lot.

971
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,428
On the margin.
Buy. Cover. Buy. Cover.

972
01:26:18,511 --> 01:26:21,431
I wanted it fast.

973
01:26:24,976 --> 01:26:27,187
See the headlines.

974
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:32,067
"Douglas Coughlin.
From bartender to billionaire."

975
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:41,034
- Doug, take it easy.
- Relax.

976
01:26:41,117 --> 01:26:45,747
The luck is gone.
The brain is shot.

977
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:48,333
But the liquor we still got.

978
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:53,672
Doug?

979
01:26:55,423 --> 01:26:57,509
Doug, are you down there?

980
01:26:57,592 --> 01:27:02,806
She knows nothing about this.
She thinks I'm a fucking hero.

981
01:27:08,561 --> 01:27:12,315
My princess. My dream.

982
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:17,737
Oh, baby, not again.
I want to go home.

983
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:22,325
Come here. Toast Flanagan.

984
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:27,622
To the first and last person
I ever cared about.

985
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:30,667
To my wife.

986
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,419
Doug?

987
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:37,257
Wake up. I want to go home.

988
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:02,782
You're the only person
in the world Doug respects.

989
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:08,204
We were a good team once.

990
01:28:09,748 --> 01:28:14,127
Walk me to my apartment.
I hate going into that place alone.

991
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:21,343
- I'd better check on Doug.
- Please.

992
01:28:22,093 --> 01:28:26,056
I want to talk about Doug,
about his problems.

993
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:08,598
Doug says you're incredible
with women. A real lady-killer.

994
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:14,688
- Is that what he says?
- What's your secret weapon?

995
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:19,734
Well, what you see is what you get.

996
01:29:38,628 --> 01:29:41,339
- Hold it.
- What did you do that for?

997
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:49,514
I can't make it
with my best friend's old lady.

998
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:55,770
Am I supposed to live with the same
man day in and day out forever?

999
01:29:55,854 --> 01:30:00,442
- And have no one else in my life?
- Yes. It's called marriage.

1000
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:04,612
You want this as much as I do.
That's why you're up here.

1001
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:08,450
But you can't do it now, can you?
You're scared.

1002
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:13,038
I don't know what I'm doing.

1003
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:15,248
You're just scared!

1004
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:40,899
Hey, Doug.

1005
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:53,995
Help me!

1006
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:56,664
Somebody help me!

1007
01:30:56,748 --> 01:31:01,378
No! Somebody help me!

1008
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:15,975
Is there anything you can tell me?

1009
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:55,515
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."

1010
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:41,144
My dearest Brian,
A guy like me looks in the mirror,

1011
01:32:41,227 --> 01:32:44,147
he either grins,
or he starts to fade away.

1012
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:48,485
And I haven't seen anything
to grin about in a long time.

1013
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:52,906
This may not be
the most graceful exit,

1014
01:32:52,989 --> 01:32:55,617
but I know when the bottle's empty.

1015
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,536
The only thing
I'm really going to miss

1016
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:01,331
is the conversations we had.

1017
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:06,753
At least I get the last word,
even if I had to mail it in.

1018
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:13,176
Coughlin's Law: Bury the dead.
They stink up the joint.

1019
01:33:13,259 --> 01:33:16,388
As for the rest of Coughlin's Laws,
ignore them.

1020
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:19,182
The guy was always full of shit.

1021
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,063
But I guess you knew that already.

1022
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:54,718
- Mooneys' apartment. Brian...
- I know. I'm not to let you in.

1023
01:33:54,801 --> 01:33:57,429
- If you just...
- Leave now!

1024
01:33:57,512 --> 01:34:02,017
I just want to talk to her.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

1025
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,020
- Send her a letter. Out!
- Get your hands off me.

1026
01:34:05,103 --> 01:34:06,563
Out!

1027
01:34:22,412 --> 01:34:25,331
- Where's Jordan?
- In there.

1028
01:34:25,415 --> 01:34:28,126
You can't go in there.
Open the door.

1029
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:30,295
Jordan?

1030
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:33,590
- I must talk to you.
- What's going on?

1031
01:34:33,673 --> 01:34:36,885
There's so many things.
I don't know where to begin.

1032
01:34:36,968 --> 01:34:38,219
Doug is dead.

1033
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:41,723
- What?
- He killed himself.

1034
01:34:43,183 --> 01:34:45,935
He was my friend,
but was too proud to let me help,

1035
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:49,147
too proud to show how he felt
until it was too late.

1036
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:51,232
I won't make that mistake.

1037
01:34:53,818 --> 01:34:57,572
- He pushed past me.
- I told you to keep him out of here.

1038
01:34:57,655 --> 01:34:59,824
- He got by me.
- Jordan, are you in there?

1039
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:03,870
I've saved money
and got a loan from my uncle.

1040
01:35:03,953 --> 01:35:07,290
With hard work, I know
I can turn it into something great.

1041
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:11,002
I know you can,
but it doesn't really matter.

1042
01:35:11,086 --> 01:35:12,462
Listen to me!

1043
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:14,798
Get me the key.

1044
01:35:14,881 --> 01:35:16,841
I love you. I want to marry you.

1045
01:35:16,925 --> 01:35:19,844
I've loved you
from the first moment I saw you.

1046
01:35:19,928 --> 01:35:22,931
- Open the door!
- Please. Please come with me.

1047
01:35:23,973 --> 01:35:26,685
Flanagan,
get the hell out of my house!

1048
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:30,522
Jordan, wake up. Don't you see why
he's come back? It's for the money.

1049
01:35:30,605 --> 01:35:34,442
- No, I don't want a thing from you.
- You won't get a penny.

1050
01:35:34,526 --> 01:35:37,028
- He's a loser.
- I'm not. Jordan, come with me.

1051
01:35:37,112 --> 01:35:38,321
Get him out of here.

1052
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,657
Stay out of this. Please.

1053
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:43,743
Throw him out of here! Come on!

1054
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:46,454
- Hold it! Just hold it!
- Jordan, don't!

1055
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:49,457
If you leave,
don't bother coming back.

1056
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:53,336
- I'm going. I love him. I'm going.
- You're not going anywhere.

1057
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,879
Stop her!

1058
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:58,258
Get your hands off her!
She's pregnant!

1059
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:01,678
You asshole!

1060
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:20,447
It didn't have to be this way,
you know.

1061
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:34,836
- You're on your own.
- That's the only way I want it.

1062
01:36:41,634 --> 01:36:45,096
A toast.
To the bride and to my nephew.

1063
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:47,015
All the happiness.

1064
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:57,275
When will I be loved?

1065
01:36:57,359 --> 01:36:58,818
Right now, baby.

1066
01:37:20,006 --> 01:37:22,425
You realise
we're both completely insane?

1067
01:37:22,509 --> 01:37:23,551
Yes.

1068
01:37:23,635 --> 01:37:26,721
You'll probably want to divorce me
in three weeks.

1069
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:28,598
Probably.

1070
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:31,685
No, you'll want to divorce me
when I'm fat and ugly.

1071
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:33,436
Just don't get too fat.

1072
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,358
I am going to be very fat,
and you are gonna love it.

1073
01:37:50,161 --> 01:37:53,456
- Brian, give us a poem.
- Yeah, come on.

1074
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:56,918
A poem?

1075
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,885
- We want a poem!
- Alright. A poem.

1076
01:38:16,521 --> 01:38:18,606
OK, a poem.

1077
01:38:20,483 --> 01:38:22,777
This poem is entitled...

1078
01:38:23,862 --> 01:38:26,781
.."Flanagan's Advice
To His Unborn Child."

1079
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:35,707
Now, if Jordan gives birth
to a fine Irish son

1080
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:38,960
There'll be Cocktails & Dreams
for him one day to run

1081
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:43,340
A business that shall yield
a financial windfall

1082
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:44,466
It better!

1083
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,551
Yes.

1084
01:38:46,968 --> 01:38:50,096
To be franchised
in every suburban shopping mall

1085
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:53,016
A dynasty! We're founding a dynasty!

1086
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:55,226
Now.

1087
01:38:56,353 --> 01:39:00,523
If a daughter arrives
to bless our clan

1088
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:04,069
I guess the shit
will certainly hit the fan

1089
01:39:06,863 --> 01:39:10,450
But this I shall promise to thee

1090
01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:13,328
I'll never let her marry
a guy like me

1091
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:20,335
Still, if she's the naughtiest of
girls with the wildest of young men

1092
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,005
I swear l will be the best dad I can

1093
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:28,301
And never, ever get spooked again.

1094
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:36,393
- I bet I can still spook you.
- No way.

1095
01:39:42,857 --> 01:39:44,943
Twins?

1096
01:39:45,944 --> 01:39:47,612
Twins?

1097
01:39:47,696 --> 01:39:49,989
Twins!

1098
01:39:51,324 --> 01:39:54,160
- Drinks are on the house.
- No! No!

1099
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:56,746
The bar is open!
