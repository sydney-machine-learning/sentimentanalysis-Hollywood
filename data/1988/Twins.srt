1
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,738
On his 35th birthday...

2
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,033
I decided to tell
Julius Benedict...

3
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:35,036
The truth about himself.

4
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,792
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

5
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,295
Of a scientific experiment...

6
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,631
Conducted by
the American government.

7
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,888
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically...

8
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:56,808
Mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

9
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,482
He knew that,
unlike other little boys...

10
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:07,320
He had not one, but six fathers-

11
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,739
all very distinguished men...

12
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:12,784
Especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

13
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:16,871
And of course...

14
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:20,166
He knew about
Mary Ann Benedict...

15
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,921
The remarkable young woman...

16
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,840
Who was selected
to be his mother.

17
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:48,696
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

18
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:53,535
That his mother died
while giving birth to him.

19
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,208
Now, what Julius did not know...

20
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,211
Not until this very moment...

21
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:07,549
Was that about a minute
after he was born...

22
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:12,388
His mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

23
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,940
I have a brother?

24
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,234
Ya.

25
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:07,862
He was sent to an
orphanage in Los Angeles...

26
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:11,282
At the same time I brought
you here to the island.

27
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:16,955
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island...

28
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,584
Helping me with my research.

29
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,004
I always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

30
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,215
How wrong I was.

31
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:29,385
I must find him.

32
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,848
Julius, Julius! Wait, wait.

33
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:40,814
I couldn't believe he was going.

34
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:44,693
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

35
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:49,322
All of his knowledge was from books.

36
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:53,326
Julius could speak 12 languages.

37
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,870
He excelled in history, science...

38
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,540
Mathematics, literature.

39
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:01,502
He was pure in body and in spirit.

40
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:02,670
Ahhh!

41
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:05,673
But for the first time...

42
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:08,009
Julius would not listen to me.

43
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:11,554
He's probably just like me.

44
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:25,235
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 Miles away.

45
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,366
But Julius did not care.

46
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,036
He had become obsessed
with the idea...

47
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,581
That his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

48
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:41,001
And desperately needed his help.

49
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:47,050
Honey, I'm home!

50
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,344
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

51
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:51,888
- Get going!
- I'm going.

52
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,248
Oh, hello, hello!

53
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,751
Oh, my goodness!

54
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,053
Goodbye.

55
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,607
- We're gonna be late for work.
- I need my horoscope.

56
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:46,069
- Yeah, horoscope.
- "Your judgment is at its peak today."

57
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:49,281
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow."

58
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:52,952
- Ooh, good one.
- I hope so.

59
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:55,287
Ladies!

60
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:58,457
- Vince!
- I thought you broke up with him.

61
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,459
I did, I did!

62
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,962
You don't mind if I talk
to your sister, do you?

63
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:08,175
She doesn't mind.

64
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,470
Don't give him any money.

65
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:15,308
Uh, no, no, I promised marnie
I wouldn't give you any money.

66
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,524
Don't look at me like-

67
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,444
don't do that thing
with your eyes.

68
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:29,114
I'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

69
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,660
You are here, and so am I.

70
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:35,329
Maybe millions
of people go by...

71
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:37,665
But they all
disappear from view.

72
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:41,419
I only have eyes for you, Linda.

73
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,464
I only have eyes for you.

74
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:49,385
Mmm.

75
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,515
- It's the baby klane!
- What?

76
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,103
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:00,689
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

78
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:03,275
Where's the little shit?

79
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:06,028
You'll have to be
more specific...

80
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,322
Concerning the clientele.

81
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:10,407
Benedict.

82
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,703
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

83
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:15,955
- Isn't that right, marnie?
- Who, Vincent?

84
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:21,211
That weasel? That creep?

85
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:25,048
I wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

86
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,221
Take out
the papers and the trash

87
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:34,849
or you don't get
no spending cash

88
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,561
if you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

89
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:42,066
you ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

90
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,486
yakety-yak don't talk back

91
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,240
I knew you were trouble
the second I laid eyes on you.

92
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:53,869
Excuse me. I just have never
heard this kind of music before.

93
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,500
Yakety-yak don't talk back

94
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:03,213
take out the papers

95
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:06,091
take... out... The... papers

96
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,720
take out the papers
take out the papers

97
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:13,515
take... out... The... papers

98
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,101
and the trash trash

99
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,780
LA-LA-LA LA-LA-LA

100
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,119

00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,613
Hey, Vince!

113
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:50,951
Listen, Al... You
gotta help me out.

114
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,537
I'm into the klane
brothers for $20,000.

115
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,873
- You borrowed money from a loan shark?
- What do you got?

116
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:00,252
Got anything for me?
See what you got.

117
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:02,879
We're doing this
too often, Vince.

118
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:05,048
I'll give you something.

119
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,261
I got a nice BMW
up on 4, stall 20.

120
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,425
Vince, I'll take all
of these you can get.

121
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,304
All right, Tony.

122
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,765
- For you.
- Thanks, Tony.

123
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,767
Yeah.

124
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:55,727
Whoa, Tony!

125
00:10:55,852 --> 00:11:00,315
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

126
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,109
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

127
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,945
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

128
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,281
No, I just could've
used some more.

129
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,951
- You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
- Yeah.

130
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:13,412
Your bowels troubling you?

131
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:25,508
What an amazing country.

132
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,386
Hey.

133
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,346
Gotta light, pal?

134
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:34,476
Oh, excuse me.
I don't smoke, pal.

135
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,603
Yeah. Ha-ha.

136
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:39,523
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

137
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:43,276
- Pickin' up something for the girlfriend?
- I don't have a girlfriend.

138
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,779
Do women really
wear those things?

139
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,739
If you're lucky, they do.

140
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,783
I can't believe it.

141
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:51,910
- You're from out of town?
- Yes.

142
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:56,082
As a matter of fact, I come from
an island in the South pacific.

143
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,710
Whoa!

144
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:03,673
What the hell did
you do to him, man!

145
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:07,677
I did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

146
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,681
Let me check him out.
A light concussion.

147
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,516
Uh-oh.

148
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,853
- I carry him to a hospital.
- No!

149
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,272
I think you should
just take off, man.

150
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:20,357
Find your horse you came in on.

151
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,317
I'm so sorry about this.

152
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:25,404
- I feel terrible.
- Me, too. Thanks a lot.

153
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,531
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

154
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:31,201
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

155
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,370
Yeah, have a nice day.

156
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:36,582
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

157
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:40,336
These are quality socks.

158
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:43,840
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

159
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:46,051
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

160
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:50,221
$53! Are you out of your mind?

161
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:53,725
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

162
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,061
So, do I look normal to you?

163
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,396
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

164
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,567
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

165
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,652
Handicapped, my ass!

166
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:06,530
I'll need your
driver's license, sir.

167
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,158
Look, I'm sorry
I lost my temper.

168
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,202
Driver's license, please.

169
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:14,121
- Look, I had a very bad day.
- Driver's license... please.

170
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:17,917
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr Benedict.

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,171
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

172
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,256
Happy Birthday. Watch your head.

173
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,384
Thanks.

174
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:34,142
Come along, now.

175
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,770
So this is where
my brother grew up.

176
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:40,607
I'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

177
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:47,448
And that's where
he must have slept!

178
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,159
Yes, it was.

179
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,120
How did you know?

180
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:55,289
It's the one I'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

181
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,291
In case of a fire...

182
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,795
I could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

183
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,300
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

184
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,637
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

185
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,727
Tell me a little bit
about Vincent.

186
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,646
Was he a great athlete?
Interested in chess and poetry?

187
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:20,482
I'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict...

188
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,318
But it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

189
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:25,447
Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,452
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

191
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,330
That is Vince?

192
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,374
He looks so happy.

193
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,335
He should.
That's sister Maria...

194
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,005
- His biology teacher.
- I always liked biology.

195
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,007
So did Vincent.

196
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,469
He disgraced sister Maria...

197
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,512
Who had to leave the order.

198
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,349
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

199
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,351
I must find my brother.

200
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,896
Do you know where he might be?

201
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,857
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

202
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,070
You're full of goodness, Julius.
I pray you never find him.

203
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,660
Benedict, visitor.

204
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,424
- I'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
- You got him.

205
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,621
I have rowed halfway
across the world-

206
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,791
wrong, I just rowed a day-

207
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:43,299
I've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

208
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,843
I've been on my island,
I'm telling you.

209
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:48,929
This is incredible that-
I have looked for-

210
00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:00,358
you've gotta talk
into the phone, bozo.

211
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:04,863
Vincent. Dearest, Vincent...

212
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:07,324
I know you don't know who I am.

213
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,993
- But believe me, I came-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

214
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,662
I've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

215
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:15,874
Tell the klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

216
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,211
Is beneath even them, all right?

217
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,506
I don't know any klane brothers.
I'm your brother, Julius.

218
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,676
Huh? Come again?

219
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:29,347
My name is Julius,
and I'm your twin brother.

220
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:33,184
Oh, obviously.

221
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:38,147
The moment I sat down, I thought
I was looking into a mirror.

222
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,734
We are not identical twins.

223
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,861
- Oh, no?
- No.

224
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:44,696
I wouldn't be too sure, pal.

225
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,698
I don't lie. I am your brother.

226
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,201
You must let me help
you get out of here.

227
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,703
You want to help me get out?

228
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,330
Yes, right now.

229
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:57,251
Well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.

230
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,092
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

231
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,844
Yeah.

232
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,804
I'm in fast company here.

233
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,432
Take a look over there.
See that man?

234
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,643
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

235
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,187
I'll be anything you want,
your aunt, Uncle, sister...

236
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,189
Your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

237
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:21,568
- All right?
- Okay, I pay right now.

238
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,237
- You pay now.
- Okay, Vince.

239
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,364
Okay. Go pay.

240
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,408
All right, pay him.

241
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:32,079
What is this, "candid camera"?

242
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,833
Ahhh, oof!

243
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:41,213
Twinny, I hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets...

244
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:45,093
Because I'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

245
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,137
- I have more money.
- You do?

246
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:50,348
I'm glad to help you.
Vincent, I'm your brother.

247
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:52,642
- I love you.
- Whoa!

248
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,771
Look, ease up
on the love talk...

249
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:58,899
Because I'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

250
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,109
Tossing your cookies?

251
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,111
Oh, that's more slang!

252
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,615
Where the hell is it?

253
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,287
- This is your car, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's it.

254
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,956
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

255
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:17,126
- How'd you know this was my car?
- We're twins!

256
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,755
I'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together...

257
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,800
Talk philosophy together,
read books together.

258
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,302
- Play chess together.
- Get lost together.

259
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,184
Vincent!

260
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,982
He's so full of energy.

261
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,364
Blue sedan deville.

262
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,991
This is beautiful.

263
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,953
Where you guys going,
out to Hawaii?

264
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:53,164
- Catch some of them big waves?
- Yeah, something like that.

265
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,250
We have plenty
of room on level 4.

266
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,551
I'll call you next Saturday.

267
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:47,012
Whoa, where you going
with my desk?

268
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,056
Takin' back this furniture, man.

269
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,392
- You're six months behind.
- You're behind!

270
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,897
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

271
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,316
There's no trust
in the world any more.

272
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,943
I tried to stop them,
Mr Benedict.

273
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,071
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

274
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,450
Vincent Benedict incorporated.

275
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:09,577
- Sports agent...
- Airborne!

276
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:13,915
- Mr Benedict?
- Yeah?

277
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:16,919
- It's Al.
- It's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

278
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:21,757
Look, miss busby, uh-
Al, hang on a second.

279
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,927
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

280
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,139
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, I'll call you.

281
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,600
Whatever you think is best.

282
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,727
- All right.
- I'll take this.

283
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:35,729
Yeah, go ahead. Take that.

284
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:38,942
Before I forget, Happy Birthday.

285
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,322
Oh, how sweet.

286
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:46,449
That's very, very nice of you.

287
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:50,495
- Aqua velva?
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,499
You shouldn't have. Stacey.

289
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,462
I'll give you a call, okay?

290
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,132
All right, all right.

291
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:03,426
Al, save me!

292
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,345
Brand-new caddy on level 4.

293
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:09,473
I'll be there! Don't move! Bye.

294
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,813
Whoa!

295
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:21,570
Time's up, Vincent.

296
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:32,330
Did you hit me?
Because I didn't feel a thing.

297
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,208
I felt that.

298
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:39,004
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

299
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,006
I like my work.

300
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:45,845
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

301
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:48,014
I don't know
what the problem is...

302
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:50,266
But I'm sure it
can be resolved...

303
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,602
- Without resorting to violence.
- Yeah.

304
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,353
Okay?

305
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:56,814
Okay.

306
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:03,197
- You moved too soon.
- He did?

307
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,364
Ahhh!

308
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:08,368
A little chest pain?

309
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:11,872
The first rule
in a crisis situation:

310
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:15,209
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

311
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,211
You negotiate first,
then you attack.

312
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:19,213
- You never negotiated.
- Na-hah!

313
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:21,256
You don't know what
kind of an enemy I am.

314
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,053
- Who are you?
- I'm Vincent's brother.

315
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,222
- We're twins.
- That's right.

316
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,725
- You're firewood!
- Axe, axe, axe!

317
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,979
You have no respect for logic.

318
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:37,524
- But he's got an axe!
- Ahhhh!

319
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:44,781
And I have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

320
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,787
You're a very stupid person.

321
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,543
You tell your brother...

322
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:58,838
He messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

323
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:05,928
I love it when you
hit people, Julius.

324
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,263
Boom!

325
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,975
That was great!

326
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,977
Actually, I hate violence.

327
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:13,979
But you're so good at it!

328
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,356
I've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

329
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,775
You could be a boxer.
I could be your manager.

330
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,320
- I don't think I could fight for money.
- No problem!

331
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:25,782
You do all the fighting,
I'll keep all the money.

332
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:28,410
I'm really worried
about you, Vincent.

333
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,290
How much money do you owe?

334
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:35,334
Don't lie to me. We're twins.

335
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:39,297
- I can feel your pain.
- Why do you keep saying that?

336
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,382
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

337
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,342
We're nothin'!

338
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:50,058
Twenty thousand.

339
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,645
Due this morning.

340
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,487
Come on.

341
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,167
Don't worry about
anything, Vincent.

342
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:18,046
As long as I'm with you,
I won't let anyone harm you, okay?

343
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:25,095
Well, you're a good guy, Julius.

344
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:27,597
Now, hang on to your seat!

345
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:40,528
You know what?
I completely forgot.

346
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:43,155
I promised this friend, Sammy...

347
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:45,491
That I'd pick his car up
from the airport.

348
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:47,451
Put it in the slot.

349
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,662
Would you do me a big favour?

350
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:52,915
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

351
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,875
Oh, I would love to.

352
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,129
Good, that would
really be a big help.

353
00:25:57,212 --> 00:26:00,715
Do you have a manual, please?

354
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,219
- A manual?
- Yeah.

355
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,598
- It's in the glove compartment.
- Oh, yeah.

356
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:10,809
There it is.

357
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,112
- What are you doin' with the finger?
- Learning to drive.

358
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:22,947
Whoa!

359
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:25,908
It's not up here.

360
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:28,327
Maybe it's under the back tyre.

361
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:32,832
Look... I mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tyre.

362
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,584
- Geez!
- What's the matter?

363
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:38,296
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

364
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,299
No. Oh, well.

365
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:44,261
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

366
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,430
Handicapped children?

367
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:49,975
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

368
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,561
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

369
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,855
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

370
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,068
Do you really think
we should do that?

371
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:00,779
It's for children.

372
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,991
You got a point.

373
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:11,039
I saw a guy from
the auto club do this once.

374
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:13,750
What do you know,
beginners luck!

375
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,963
These cars have terrific alarms!

376
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:21,466
I'll get it in a minute.

377
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,970
Just a second, Jules.

378
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:27,973
Whoa!

379
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

380
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:45,283
If you lift the rear end
at an angle greater than 45%...

381
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,286
The Mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system...

382
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,705
So that the alarm's
computer thinks...

383
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:53,125
That the car is being
towed and shuts off.

384
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:57,212
Can I have the keys to your car?

385
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:01,341
You know, the keys to your car?

386
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:04,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No yodelling.

387
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:09,183
Lovely day.

388
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,645
Come on, Julius.

389
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:29,288
Step on it!

390
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:32,541
Yeeeoow!

391
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:46,972
Oh, my God!

392
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:50,393
- I am amazed at how well it's going.
- You're doing good.

393
00:28:50,477 --> 00:28:53,062
Don't use both feet
at the same time.

394
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:57,108
- Just use the gas.
- Okay, one foot.

395
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:59,194
- One pedal at a time.
- Okay! I will do it!

396
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,300
Pick up the phone, the phone.

397
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:24,261
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

398
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:33,605
This is Vincent's car.
Can I help you, please?

399
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,316
- Julius!
- Vincent, where are you?

400
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,985
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

401
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,114
That's me.

402
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,990
Hello, yeah. Hello!

403
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,536
What are you doing back there?

404
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,665
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

405
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,961
- Supermarket.
- Take your foot off the gas.

406
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,464
Apply it to the brake.
It's the thing next to the gas.

407
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,589
The brake pedal.

408
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,801
- Very gently.
- You got it.

409
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,179
Bye, Vincent.

410
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,432
All right.

411
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,813
Okay, it's a supermarket.

412
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,699
Ohhh!

413
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,743
Ohhh!

414
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,632
That's what I call fun.

415
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,843
Did you see me
with the two wheels?

416
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:44,471
I can teach you that, Vincent.

417
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:47,015
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

418
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,268
Nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?

419
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,353
So, what do you think?

420
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:54,481
Angel's food or devil's food?

421
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:56,441
Devil's.

422
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:59,028
- You know what I really love about Vince?
- What?

423
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,864
He's a force of nature.

424
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,741
- You're outta control.
- No, I'm not.

425
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:06,619
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

426
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:09,580
I know. Geez,
you think I don't know that!

427
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,665
- I don't think you know that.
- Well, I do.

428
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:15,503
It's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

429
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:19,049
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

430
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:24,054
- Vince has a truly romantic soul.
- I can't hear this any more.

431
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:27,099
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like I have...

432
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:29,601
You'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

433
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:31,728
And you'd get laid.

434
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,204
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

435
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:51,040
Excuse me.

436
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,293
She's not bad.

437
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:58,005
I had no idea
that these magazines...

438
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:02,386
Had things like
this inside, inside them.

439
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:05,264
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

440
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:09,309
I come from a tropical island
in the South pacific.

441
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:12,980
It's around 300 nautical Miles,
South, southwest of Fiji.

442
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:17,734
I just got here yesterday
and I already found my brother.

443
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:19,445
Your brother?

444
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:21,530
That's right.

445
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:23,658
My twin brother, Vincent.

446
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:26,953
- Twins?
- Vince!

447
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,956
- Linda.
- Hi.

448
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:32,876
Oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.

449
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:35,003
- You do.
- Really?

450
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,677
Hi. Who's this guy?

451
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:44,679
This is Vincent's brother.

452
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:48,142
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- Me, either.

453
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,060
You know each other?

454
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:52,688
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

455
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:56,650
- This is Linda.
- Hi.

456
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:59,528
- Hello.
- Her charming sister, marnie.

457
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,742
Sisters?

458
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:06,995
Twins?

459
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,623
Are you sure
this guy's all right?

460
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:12,209
He's okay. He's helping me out.

461
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:15,504
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

462
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,507
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

463
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,301
Catch ya later.

464
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:24,346
Great seeing ya. Catch ya later.

465
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,348
Oops!

466
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:32,939
I've only been driving an hour.

467
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:38,694
- Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- Yeah, kinda.

468
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,073
- Is marnie your girlfriend, too?
- Marnie?

469
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:45,868
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

470
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:48,204
- Me?
- Yeah.

471
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:52,042
- She hardly knows me.
- That's the best way.

472
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,586
You see, women love men...

473
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,047
Who are mysterious and devious.

474
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,091
Keeps them on their toes.

475
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:02,386
- It excites them. You know what I mean?
- No.

476
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:05,139
- You do like women?
- Very much so.

477
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:07,141
They're strange and sensitive.

478
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:09,601
They have compassion.

479
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:12,730
I have the highest
respect for women.

480
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:19,279
You're a virgin!

481
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,326
That's private.

482
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:29,748
A 230-pound virgin.

483
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:32,917
It's all right. It's something-

484
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:35,838
it's just one of those things.

485
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:39,467
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

486
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:44,305
Such a baby cat.
Look, did I neglect you?

487
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,724
Not any more. Come on.

488
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:49,894
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

489
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:52,062
Okay, here you go.

490
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:54,523
You named your cat Julius?

491
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:04,868
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

492
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:07,704
- There we go.
- That much cheese?

493
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:10,082
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

494
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:12,125
There you go.

495
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:16,339
I know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

496
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:20,134
And spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland...

497
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:22,804
We just nuke it.

498
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:26,307
That's it. Here we go.

499
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:31,187
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

500
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,690
- Yummy.
- Yeah.

501
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:50,749
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

502
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,043
Through the lips, over the gums,
look out-

503
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:56,505
look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

504
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,299
- Julius!
- Oh, I like nuked food.

505
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:02,262
- Mm-mmm!
- Mmm!

506
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:29,123
Now let me get this straight.

507
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:31,709
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

508
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,711
- Yes!
- And another one was...

509
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:37,631
- A physicist at M.I.T.?
- Yes, he won the nobei prize.

510
00:36:37,715 --> 00:36:41,051
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

511
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:46,266
And mom... Was like...
superwoman.

512
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:51,688
But she didn't survive
the delivery.

513
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:54,399
And I was sent
to an orphanage...

514
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:57,110
While you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

515
00:36:57,235 --> 00:36:59,946
By a scientist who
you do research for...

516
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,033
But who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

517
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:05,453
Did I leave anything out?

518
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:09,457
I think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

519
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:12,335
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

520
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:14,670
To the sperm milk shake.

521
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:17,173
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

522
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:20,134
Do you know how many times
I've heard stories like this?

523
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:22,929
It's every orphan's fantasy.

524
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:25,473
My real mom and dad were rich...

525
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:27,476
And beautiful.

526
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:30,354
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

527
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:33,315
And I got switched
with another baby.

528
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,068
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

529
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,153
And there they'll be...

530
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:42,825
With open arms, crying,
"my darling.

531
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,161
"My treasure. We didn't know.

532
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:48,456
How can we make it up to you?"

533
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:51,126
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

534
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:53,211
It's a crock.

535
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:59,050
I liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

536
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:03,930
Here it is. Read it and weep.

537
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:07,434
"Dear sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

538
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:10,479
- "For Vincent Benedict has been denied."
- Denied, yeah.

539
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:14,817
"According to our files,
his mother did not die...

540
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:16,819
- "During birth."
- She's not dead.

541
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:19,321
"We have a current
address for her at...

542
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:21,490
"172 canyon Glen drive,
Los Angeles.

543
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:24,368
"Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment...

544
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:27,329
And as such,
he's ineligible for aid."

545
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:30,917
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

546
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:37,299
This letter was written
30 years ago.

547
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,760
We were five years old.

548
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:41,970
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

549
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:44,556
You knew all this time
where she was...

550
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:46,850
And you never contacted her?

551
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:51,396
I don't know about your mother,
"miss perfect, 1952"...

552
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,734
But my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive...

553
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:56,861
I hope she's in a lot of pain.

554
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:58,821
She dumped me once.

555
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:01,491
There is no way I'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

556
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:04,452
If they have lied to us about mama
for all these years...

557
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:07,705
Maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

558
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:10,541
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

559
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,627
I got a cash-flow problem.

560
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:14,564
Hello.

561
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:16,423
Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

562
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:18,926
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

563
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:21,345
Or else what, you blimp?

564
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:34,983
Oh, we're rollin'.

565
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,904
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

566
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:39,906
- Mr Garfield, there's a man-
- Not now.

567
00:39:46,913 --> 00:39:50,250
- Who are you?
- I'm Webster.

568
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:53,875
It's okay!

569
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,421
Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

570
00:39:55,547 --> 00:39:57,675
We were never supposed to meet.

571
00:39:57,758 --> 00:40:01,053
- You're supposed to be-
- Driving that car down to Texas.

572
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:04,598
I got my driving gloves.
I got my driving glasses.

573
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,600
I got my driving hat.

574
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:09,145
But I got no car.

575
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,106
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

576
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,275
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

577
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,153
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

578
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,949
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

579
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:22,451
Sit down.

580
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:27,372
I got a reputation to uphold.

581
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:30,083
People put their trust in me.

582
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,169
They know I always
deliver the goods...

583
00:40:32,294 --> 00:40:34,629
And I always come
back with the money.

584
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:37,424
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

585
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:40,970
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

586
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:43,681
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

587
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:46,184
- The parking attendant?
- He liked the car.

588
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:48,770
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

589
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:52,440
You know,
I just realized that...

590
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:55,485
In over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

591
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:57,445
Has ever seen my face.

592
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:00,323
I don't think that's
a problem. Hey!

593
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,869
No, please, please!

594
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,226
- Hi.
- Hi.

595
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,663
Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?

596
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,022
Grandpa...

597
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:33,399
This man wants to talk to you.

598
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:36,569
Thank you.

599
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:41,366
Hello?

600
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:43,409
Yes, can I help you?

601
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,579
I'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

602
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,623
I know this may sound strange...

603
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:51,043
But I'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

604
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:54,088
Mary Ann Benedict.

605
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:01,887
She was my mother.

606
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,145
You're Mary Ann's son?

607
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:13,066
That looks just
like you, grandpa.

608
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,360
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

609
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:18,363
And help grandma
with lunch, okay?

610
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,712
Dad?

611
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,715
Uh... no!

612
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:39,927
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad!

613
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:42,138
Dad!

614
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,515
- Wait a minute!
- Dad! It is you!

615
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,768
This is a big surprise.

616
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:49,103
Dad, this is incredible.
I don't know what to-

617
00:42:49,145 --> 00:42:51,607
we could use a drink.
Where'd you come from?

618
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:54,610
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

619
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:15,548
Uh, Mr Webster,
I hope you are happy with the vehicle...

620
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:19,135
We chose for
your little journey.

621
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:23,306
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

622
00:43:23,348 --> 00:43:26,976
And ask for uh, uh,
beetroot McKinley.

623
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,980
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

624
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:33,025
Thank you.

625
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,237
Mary Ann Benedict.

626
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,908
I haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

627
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:45,996
Your mother was...
An amazing woman.

628
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:50,668
Oh, the times I've wondered what would
have happened if I'd have married her.

629
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:53,045
Why didn't you?

630
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:56,800
Oh, I asked her to.
She turned me down.

631
00:43:56,883 --> 00:44:00,595
She said she was afraid...

632
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,181
To have any more children.

633
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:06,309
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

634
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:09,020
Who told her we died?

635
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,112
Mitchell traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

636
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,198
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

637
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:23,661
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, new Mexico.

638
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,038
I'll have to pay him a visit.

639
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,374
Watch out for him.

640
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,170
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what I mean.

641
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,882
Dickhead?

642
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,510
No, I don't.

643
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,805
But... I'm learning.

644
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,772
I'm concerned about the time frame.

645
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:52,733
That's my private line, honey.
I'll take care of that.

646
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,235
You boys, excuse me.

647
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,037
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

648
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,957
Uh, Webster.

649
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:12,045
I'm callin' from California.
I happen to have something-

650
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:15,715
some merchandise
that you might want.

651
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,468
Well, bring it to me, son.

652
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:20,596
Let me enrich you.

653
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:22,973
Well, uh, Mr beetroot...

654
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,309
It's the amount of enrichment...

655
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,603
That I wanted to talk about.

656
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:31,148
Don't try and renegotiate
with old beetroot, son.

657
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,818
Now look, beetroot...

658
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:37,113
If we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

659
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:39,782
Look, there's no way,
Mr beetroot...

660
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:43,620
That I am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

661
00:45:43,662 --> 00:45:48,291
Unless I know for sure
that I have...

662
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,794
Twenty for my cut.

663
00:45:50,836 --> 00:45:53,964
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

664
00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:56,091
You're out of your
goddam, greedy mind!

665
00:45:56,174 --> 00:46:00,804
- I guess that seems a little high for you.
- Yeah!

666
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:06,352
I'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

667
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:10,982
- The deal is five!
- Five?

668
00:46:11,065 --> 00:46:13,234
I could do better
than five here.

669
00:46:15,111 --> 00:46:19,115
If you can do better
than five million dollars...

670
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:22,660
Well, then, son, you take it.

671
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:40,345
Beetroot,
I'll see you in Houston.

672
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,598
After all, fair is fair.

673
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:46,477
I'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

674
00:46:46,602 --> 00:46:49,856
Well, good.

675
00:46:59,824 --> 00:47:02,035
Five million!

676
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:04,287
Five million dollars!

677
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,581
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

678
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:08,751
Five million dollars!

679
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:12,213
Five, five million dollars!

680
00:47:12,254 --> 00:47:15,174
Five million dollars!

681
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:18,511
Five m-m-million!

682
00:47:21,222 --> 00:47:23,599
Cash, lots of cash.

683
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:25,893
Whoa!

684
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:29,815
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

685
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:33,902
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- I met one of our fathers.

686
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,113
He told me about
a man in new Mexico...

687
00:47:36,238 --> 00:47:39,658
- Who probably knows where mom is.
- Oh, great! Yes!

688
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:42,202
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No?

689
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:44,830
You know what I mean?
She didn't abandon you.

690
00:47:44,913 --> 00:47:46,915
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh!

691
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,377
- They told her that I died.
- No kidding?

692
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:53,131
Look, Julius, I'm in a hurry.

693
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:56,592
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
- Yeah.

694
00:47:56,717 --> 00:47:59,887
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

695
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:03,307
- So I'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston?

696
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:07,436
Hous... hou-no! - You
know something?

697
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,523
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

698
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:14,778
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

699
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:17,698
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

700
00:48:17,823 --> 00:48:20,784
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

701
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:23,954
We have to see this man, traven,
in new Mexico.

702
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:25,453
No, we don't have to see
this man in new Mexico.

703
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:26,957
Yes, we do!

704
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:30,878
And I'm coming with you.

705
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:37,969
We'll go see the man.

706
00:48:38,052 --> 00:48:41,264
- I take a shower. I get my bags.
- Get your bags.

707
00:48:41,347 --> 00:48:43,683
Be right out. Oh, boy!

708
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:46,978
I'll be here, bro. Okay.

709
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,989
This place is a zoo!

710
00:48:57,072 --> 00:49:00,326
Wait, wait.

711
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:04,830
- Happy Birthday, Vince.
- Oh.

712
00:49:04,914 --> 00:49:08,834
- Happy Birthday, Vince.
- God.

713
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:10,833
It's not my birthday.
Better late than never.

714
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,838
Oh.

715
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,008
Look what marnie
made for Julius.

716
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,929
- You baked?
- Yeah. Is Julius around?

717
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:23,850
- He's taking a shower.
- I'll go give these to him.

718
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:25,310
So-o-o!

719
00:49:25,435 --> 00:49:28,980
- Where'd you get this car?
- Sammy. You know Sammy.

720
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:33,193
- Where you going?
- Inside. Have some coffee?

721
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:37,364
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say goodbye.

722
00:49:37,405 --> 00:49:39,909
Take out your papers and your trash

723
00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:43,037
or you don't get
no spending cash

724
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,957
if you don't scrub
the kitchen floor

725
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,126
you ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

726
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,837
yakety-yak yakety-yak
don't talk back

727
00:49:50,878 --> 00:49:52,505
Marnie!

728
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:57,718
Excuse me, but I was
just taking a shower.

729
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,720
Good singing.

730
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:02,182
I baked you some cookies.

731
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:05,185
- Cookies?
- I guess it was a dumb idea.

732
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:09,565
No, not at all. I'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

733
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:16,405
- I should put on some clothes.
- I'm sorry, I'll turn around.

734
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:19,783
Linda and I just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

735
00:50:19,908 --> 00:50:22,745
- For his birthday.
- I had birthday, too.

736
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,914
Oh, that's right.

737
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:28,084
You're twins.

738
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,883
Huh?

739
00:50:34,924 --> 00:50:36,926
Whoa.

740
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:40,597
What is it?

741
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,641
I don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

742
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:46,270
- A fortune? That's great!
- Yeah!

743
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:48,272
Excuse me!

744
00:50:49,607 --> 00:50:51,442
Excuse me.

745
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:53,861
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money...

746
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:58,115
Never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

747
00:50:58,157 --> 00:51:02,244
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Vince?

748
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:05,582
I cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

749
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:09,044
Vincent, I'm comin' with you.

750
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:11,379
Linda, no,
you're not coming with me.

751
00:51:11,463 --> 00:51:13,590
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not coming.

752
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:17,093
You could get killed and die and
I wouldn't know what happened.

753
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,471
- No!
- You say "no" one more time...

754
00:51:19,596 --> 00:51:23,308
- I'm gonna tell everybody that there's-
- Shut up! Shut up!

755
00:51:27,188 --> 00:51:29,899
All right. Oh, God.

756
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:32,151
All right, you're coming.

757
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:36,405
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

758
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:38,950
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

759
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:41,285
Like in "roots" or something.
All right?

760
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:43,496
- Does this one look okay?
- It looks fine.

761
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:47,083
It's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

762
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:50,671
- Marnie, guess what?
- Linda, what?

763
00:51:50,796 --> 00:51:53,799
Vince just asked us to go to new Mexico
and Texas with him.

764
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:56,176
This is a great idea.

765
00:51:56,301 --> 00:51:58,092
Vincent, is this true?
We all go together?

766
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,930
Yeah.

767
00:52:00,013 --> 00:52:03,350
I thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

768
00:52:03,475 --> 00:52:05,352
And spent a few days
on the road together.

769
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:07,604
Nice shirt.

770
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:12,861
- Feels great. It's all cotton.
- Well, it breathes.

771
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,865
It's okay. Come out.

772
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:19,701
All right. Here, Linda.

773
00:52:19,784 --> 00:52:23,204
Oh, can I ride
in front with Vincent?

774
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:25,290
- Sure.
- Thanks.

775
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:43,309
Now, let me see.

776
00:52:43,434 --> 00:52:45,895
I'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

777
00:52:45,978 --> 00:52:48,063
Sorry, it's my first day
on the job.

778
00:52:48,147 --> 00:52:50,900
Have a nice day.

779
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:58,241
Now, where do I find
this very special person...

780
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:01,953
Mr Vince Benedict?

781
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:33,569
Well, what have we here?

782
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:36,405
What a cute little kitty.

783
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:38,617
Where's daddy?

784
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:52,631
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

785
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:54,758
Open up, Vince.
We know you're in there.

786
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,344
Come on, we just
wanna talk to you.

787
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,473
Howdy!

788
00:54:01,975 --> 00:54:05,603
Who are you?

789
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:07,647
It's not really
important, is it?

790
00:54:07,689 --> 00:54:09,732
I was just feeding the cat,
then I was gonna leave.

791
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:11,651
I asked you a question.

792
00:54:11,734 --> 00:54:14,988
- Well, who are you?
- We're the klane brothers.

793
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:17,157
That's Burt, this is
Morris, and I'm Bob.

794
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,745
- Interesting gene pool.
- Don't cast dispersions.

795
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:24,832
I beg your pardon. But you're
looking for Vince Benedict.

796
00:54:24,874 --> 00:54:27,042
- Right.
- Am I Vince Benedict?

797
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:30,671
So what difference
does it make who I am?

798
00:54:30,713 --> 00:54:33,841
- Hit him, Bobby.
- Yeah.

799
00:54:33,883 --> 00:54:35,718
Hey! All right.

800
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:37,845
Your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.

801
00:54:37,887 --> 00:54:41,349
- Could be contagious. Bye, bye.
- Ow! Ow!

802
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:46,480
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

803
00:54:49,357 --> 00:54:51,693
- You want a doctor?
- Ow!

804
00:54:51,818 --> 00:54:54,696
I'll call a doctor.

805
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,543
Sorry I tore your shirt.
I don't know what happened.

806
00:55:46,668 --> 00:55:48,586
It's all right.

807
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:50,588
- Julius!
- What?

808
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:54,050
- Are you allergic to something?
- No.

809
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:57,053
Then why are these bumps
all over your body?

810
00:55:57,137 --> 00:56:00,431
You're all swelled up.
You look like you're ready to explode.

811
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:04,435
Put this shirt on. There are
women and children present.

812
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:07,480
And your back,
it's worse than the front.

813
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:11,277
- It's like north Dakota.
- You're so funny, Vincent.

814
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:15,447
This is for the t-shirt
and the sandwiches.

815
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:22,121
- Born to be bad.
- Yes, we are.

816
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:24,498
Ooh, you're so scary.

817
00:56:24,623 --> 00:56:26,792
Linda.

818
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:29,296
Linda!

819
00:56:29,421 --> 00:56:31,631
Well, what do you think?

820
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:36,970
- Let's rock and roll.
- It's his first t-shirt.

821
00:56:55,406 --> 00:56:57,408
- Honey, honey.
- Yeah?

822
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,995
See if you can get us
a room with a king-size bed?

823
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,577
Right.

824
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:04,081
We'll get us settled.
We'll meet you here.

825
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:07,877
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

826
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:11,672
I don't need a king-size bed.
I always sleep on the floor.

827
00:57:11,964 --> 00:57:16,178
Uh, I don't know, Jules.
I hope this is a good idea.

828
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:19,723
Come on.

829
00:57:19,848 --> 00:57:22,976
Now, look, promise me something.

830
00:57:23,018 --> 00:57:27,439
If this Professor traven
has never heard of...

831
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:30,067
You know, mom or us twins...

832
00:57:30,192 --> 00:57:33,028
Or all our dads
or the experiment...

833
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:35,323
You won't be upset.

834
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:38,326
All I want him to do
is tell us the truth.

835
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:41,246
I don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.

836
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:45,208
Get the hell out of here
before I call security.

837
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:50,004
Well, that's that.
On to Houston.

838
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:51,962
He's lying!

839
00:57:51,986 --> 00:57:53,925
Take it easy. He said he
was gonna call security.

840
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,596
For the first time in my life,
I'm pissed off!

841
00:57:57,721 --> 00:57:59,761
Julius, don't do this to me.
I got a car to deliver.

842
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,101
The last thing I need is
a detour in the slammer.

843
00:58:02,226 --> 00:58:04,895
- I'm gonna make him tell us the truth.
- No!

844
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:10,484
That's our mother.
Those are our six fathers.

845
00:58:10,568 --> 00:58:13,529
That's Werner. And that is you.

846
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:18,410
- So start talking.
- Everything okay, dr traven?

847
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:23,290
Um, yes. It's okay.

848
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:25,625
I'll take care of it.

849
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,632
Well, Vincent...

850
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,553
You turned out just like
I thought you would.

851
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:38,597
What did you do,
escape from prison?

852
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,813
How'd you know my name?

853
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,859
I named you.

854
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:08,128
We sealed this door
the day after you were born.

855
00:59:23,812 --> 00:59:27,065
Well, come on in.
This is what you wanted to see.

856
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:45,084
You came out first, of course.

857
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:48,754
We weren't expecting... Him.

858
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:53,425
This, uh...

859
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,886
Must be where you
made the milk shake.

860
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:59,014
We weren't making milk shakes.

861
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:02,893
We were making the most fully-developed
human the world has ever seen.

862
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:06,648
But instead of just
one perfect kid...

863
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:11,069
- Mom had the two of us. Way to go, mom!
- Wrong!

864
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:14,614
The embryo did split
in two, but...

865
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:17,200
It didn't split equally.

866
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:21,496
All the purity and
strength went into Julius.

867
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,540
All the crap
that was left over...

868
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:26,209
Went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.

869
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:28,254
Whoa. You telling me
I'm the crap?

870
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:31,215
- This is not true.
- Wait, Julius.

871
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:35,011
You're telling me that I am
the leftover crap? I'm no good?

872
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:38,097
- He's wrong.
- Look at him.

873
01:00:40,558 --> 01:00:45,062
Are you saying that
I'm a side effect?

874
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:48,192
You haven't got the brain power
to understand this...

875
01:00:48,275 --> 01:00:51,778
And I haven't got the time.
Show's over.

876
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,242
Hey, dickhead.

877
01:00:57,326 --> 01:00:59,912
Tell us where our mother is.

878
01:01:00,037 --> 01:01:03,040
Um... whispering pines.

879
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:06,585
It's an artists' colony
200 Miles north of Santa Fe.

880
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:15,094
If you're lying to me,
I'll be back.

881
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:28,191
Come on.

882
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,710
My life just got
flushed down the toilet.

883
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:51,507
No, Vincent. Your life
is just about to begin.

884
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:54,302
I'm genetic garbage.

885
01:01:54,427 --> 01:01:58,223
We're twins.
We're basically the same.

886
01:01:58,306 --> 01:02:02,102
Julius, I know this is
a touchy subject for you...

887
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,813
But we don't look the same,
we don't act the same...

888
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:06,478
We don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.

889
01:02:06,502 --> 01:02:08,066
I know.

890
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,486
So if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different?

891
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,030
We had six fathers.

892
01:02:14,156 --> 01:02:16,951
We're different parts of
a lot of different people.

893
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:19,579
Yeah?

894
01:02:19,662 --> 01:02:23,708
Don't forget. I was taken
to a beautiful island.

895
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,669
I was loved. I was
protected, educated.

896
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:30,047
You had nobody, Vincent.

897
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:33,801
Nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.

898
01:02:33,885 --> 01:02:36,847
All life taught you was
that the only person you...

899
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:39,975
Could count on was yourself.

900
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:49,234
You see, Vincent...

901
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,946
You're the missing part
of my life.

902
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:56,116
And I'm the missing part
of your life.

903
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,286
When we find mama...

904
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:00,872
We can fill the
missing part of hers.

905
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:06,669
We won't be alone any more.

906
01:03:06,753 --> 01:03:10,381
We can be a family.

907
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:18,431
A family?

908
01:03:18,556 --> 01:03:20,476
Yes.

909
01:03:22,728 --> 01:03:25,397
You mean, like,
with a Christmas tree...

910
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:27,608
And Thanksgiving dinner?

911
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:29,610
And a real home...

912
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:34,073
Where you'll always be welcome.

913
01:03:34,156 --> 01:03:36,283
Always?

914
01:03:36,408 --> 01:03:40,412
Even when you've been bad.

915
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:49,673
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

916
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:51,758
Yeah, yeah, ooh.

917
01:03:51,883 --> 01:03:54,970
Yes, um-mm. Oh, look.

918
01:03:55,095 --> 01:03:58,265
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes, of course it's necessary.

919
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:01,852
I'm not going to introduce you to my mother
looking like a goat herder from Albania.

920
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:03,938
You need clothes.

921
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,774
- But I feel fine the way I am.
- But you look like a-

922
01:04:06,816 --> 01:04:10,111
- hello, can I help you?
- Do I look like I need help?

923
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:13,239
Here's the problem.
We gotta do a whole ensemble.

924
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:28,005
- Do I look okay?
- You look better. Let's put it that way.

925
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,090
You know what
we have to do, Jules?

926
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,467
We gotta work on the way
you're walking.

927
01:04:32,509 --> 01:04:36,221
You look a little stiff.
You ever see "Frankenstein"?

928
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,807
- I read the book.
- That's not gonna help.

929
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:43,270
When you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music...

930
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,272
And I don't mean
a military march.

931
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:48,193
Like, you know, aretha Franklin
and Otis Redding...

932
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:50,862
And Wilson pickett,
a couple of white people.

933
01:04:50,945 --> 01:04:53,323
- Like this?
- Yeah. Bop! That's it.

934
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:56,201
- Yeah, loose!
- Oh, I like that.

935
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:59,370
I got something for you.
Try these on.

936
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,707
- Sunglasses?
- Yeah, here you go.

937
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:08,255
Now, that's it. There. Yeah!

938
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:11,342
That's it. Yeah!

939
01:05:11,467 --> 01:05:13,344
- Whoops!
- Whoa!

940
01:05:13,427 --> 01:05:17,515
- Do I look cooi now?
- Mr lce.

941
01:05:17,598 --> 01:05:20,684
Yeah, just breeze
on through. Yeah!

942
01:05:20,768 --> 01:05:24,355
Tonight

943
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,398
tonight's the night

944
01:05:26,524 --> 01:05:28,902
it's gonna be a good night, bro

945
01:05:29,027 --> 01:05:31,863
and everything's gonna
happen, bro

946
01:05:31,947 --> 01:05:34,074
and you take her in your arms

947
01:05:34,157 --> 01:05:36,743
and you plant a good
one on her... ho

948
01:05:36,868 --> 01:05:38,745
tonight's the night

949
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,747
tonight, tonight, tonight

950
01:05:40,872 --> 01:05:47,754
tonight is your night, bro

951
01:05:47,879 --> 01:05:50,258
yeah, it's your night, bro!

952
01:05:50,383 --> 01:05:52,343
Oh yeah, bro you're gonna do it

953
01:05:52,385 --> 01:05:54,470
you're gonna cut it

954
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:56,722
you're making me nervous!

955
01:05:56,806 --> 01:05:59,058
- Well, you're nervous.
- You've got to help me.

956
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:01,227
- What?
- I've never been out on a date before.

957
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,479
- That's okay.
- I don't know what to do.

958
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:06,941
Well, you talk to her.
You buy her a couple of drinks.

959
01:06:07,066 --> 01:06:08,943
You dance with her, bro

960
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:12,781
you gonna dance with

961
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:14,700
you dance?

962
01:06:18,787 --> 01:06:20,932
Oh, you probably never
did that before, either.

963
01:06:20,956 --> 01:06:23,125
No.

964
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,127
Oh, well, look.

965
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:27,212
All right.

966
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:30,215
The first thing is, Jules...

967
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,467
Forget about disco.

968
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:35,430
- Right? No disco.
- No disco.

969
01:06:35,555 --> 01:06:39,058
When I really wanna
romance a girl...

970
01:06:39,142 --> 01:06:41,352
I waltz with her.

971
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:45,023
Rah-tah-tah rah-tah-tah

972
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:47,400
- you mean, like Strauss?
- Yeah.

973
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:50,403
It turns 'em into
putty in your hands.

974
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:52,739
Rump-bump-bum
diddilly-ump-bump

975
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,994
rump-bump-bum, rump-bump-bum
rump-bump-bum

976
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,747
come on, let's assume
the dance position.

977
01:06:59,788 --> 01:07:01,916
I'll give you
a couple of pointers.

978
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:04,126
- I really appreciate that.
- Come on. Let's go.

979
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:06,337
I hope nobody's
looking in the window.

980
01:07:06,462 --> 01:07:08,380
Come on, like this. Here you go.

981
01:07:08,464 --> 01:07:12,134
Put your feet by my feet.
Come on. Let's go.

982
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:15,804
By my feet...

983
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:18,058
Not on my feet.
Thanks very much.

984
01:07:18,141 --> 01:07:20,936
- Sorry, Vincent.
- Minor oversight.

985
01:07:20,977 --> 01:07:23,146
Grab my hand. Come on.

986
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:26,525
Yeow! Ah! Ease up!

987
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:28,482
Tiny bit. Let the blood
flow through the fingers.

988
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:30,403
Oh, like loose?

989
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:32,822
- See, come on. That's it, relax.
- I'm just nervous.

990
01:07:32,906 --> 01:07:36,201
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.

991
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:38,746
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

992
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,790
- One, two, three.
- Don't, no.

993
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:42,917
- One, two, three.
- See what you're doing with your teeth?

994
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,920
You're grinding them.
Don't grind your teeth.

995
01:07:46,045 --> 01:07:48,673
Don't grind your teeth.

996
01:07:48,756 --> 01:07:51,050
Relax your jaws, yeah.

997
01:07:51,175 --> 01:07:55,096
Now try to count without
moving your lips, all right?

998
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:58,724
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

999
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,353
See? That's it.
You're not wrestling a boar...

1000
01:08:01,436 --> 01:08:04,773
300 Miles South,
southwest of Fiji.

1001
01:08:04,857 --> 01:08:10,445
If I die for this dance

1002
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:12,698
hold you and talk of

1003
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:15,868
romance

1004
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:18,412
I've never been lucky

1005
01:08:18,537 --> 01:08:22,625
I've got to take a chance

1006
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:27,922
I'm caught up
in some kind of trance

1007
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:33,011
and yes I would die
for this dance

1008
01:08:35,972 --> 01:08:38,600
where did you come from

1009
01:08:38,725 --> 01:08:41,060
out of nowhere it seems

1010
01:08:41,186 --> 01:08:44,231
- may be an angel
- Good, Jules.

1011
01:08:44,356 --> 01:08:47,359
Smiling on me

1012
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:49,403
I know it's crazy

1013
01:08:49,445 --> 01:08:52,072
you've taken my heart

1014
01:08:52,156 --> 01:08:54,533
I'll never leave you

1015
01:08:54,617 --> 01:08:56,911
you're my missing part

1016
01:08:57,036 --> 01:09:01,916
yes I'd die for this dance

1017
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:08,798
hold you and talk of romance

1018
01:09:08,924 --> 01:09:14,721
I've never been lucky
I've got to take a chance

1019
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:17,933
yeah!

1020
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:21,728
I'm caught up in
some kind of trance

1021
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:27,944
yes I would die for this dance

1022
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:47,631
way to go, Jules!

1023
01:09:47,714 --> 01:09:49,675
Ahhh!

1024
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:54,471
Did you know they had beer
in ancient Egypt?

1025
01:09:54,555 --> 01:09:56,557
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

1026
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,769
It was actually the assyrians
that developed the beer.

1027
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:04,690
The Egyptians were the first
to perfect the malt process.

1028
01:10:04,815 --> 01:10:09,320
- You know a lot about beer.
- He knows about everything.

1029
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:11,990
It's all from books.
Until tonight, I've never had a beer.

1030
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:17,287
All theory, no practise.
The story of my life.

1031
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:22,000
- Awww!
- We're gonna change all that.

1032
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,960
Aren't we, marnie?

1033
01:10:25,253 --> 01:10:27,255
- Marnie.
- What?

1034
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,799
Am I shit-faced yet?

1035
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:36,557
Excuse me, but...
My back teeth are floating.

1036
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:43,314
Excuse me, I have to check if
my back teeth are floating.

1037
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:45,274
Good shot.

1038
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,363
Woo-hoo! Ooo!

1039
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:57,829
Oh, God. We both flushed at
the same time before we did it.

1040
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:02,918
Yeah, right. Woo-hoo!

1041
01:11:03,043 --> 01:11:06,087
Hey, Jules. Marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.

1042
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,173
Tonight is your lucky night.
I know it.

1043
01:11:08,215 --> 01:11:12,219
- I don't think marnie likes me.
- You kidding? Piece of cake.

1044
01:11:12,344 --> 01:11:15,181
This woman is ripe.
You're nervous...

1045
01:11:15,264 --> 01:11:17,642
Because it's your first time.
Perfectly natural.

1046
01:11:20,102 --> 01:11:22,063
Really.

1047
01:11:25,525 --> 01:11:28,569
Were you nervous the first time?

1048
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:34,242
I was 12 years old and she was
a nun. Talk about pressure.

1049
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:37,746
Whoa!

1050
01:11:37,871 --> 01:11:39,748
Come on, hit 'em.

1051
01:11:39,873 --> 01:11:41,750
- What?
- Hit 'em, hit 'em.

1052
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,253
Oh, hit 'em, hit 'em.

1053
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:50,133
Julius... You know...

1054
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:53,887
Julius, I have to admit this.

1055
01:11:53,929 --> 01:11:57,141
Since you and I first met, uh...

1056
01:11:57,267 --> 01:11:59,602
My life has been just
getting better and better.

1057
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:03,022
Mine, too.

1058
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:05,024
I'm so happy, Vincent.

1059
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:07,485
I feel like sometimes, like...

1060
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:10,029
- Picking you up and hug you...
- Whoa!

1061
01:12:10,113 --> 01:12:12,156
And hug you, hug you, hug you.

1062
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:17,495
Hey, he's my brother.

1063
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,708
Oh, lay off the beer, Julius.

1064
01:12:29,967 --> 01:12:33,512
Did you tell anyone
we were coming to Santa Fe?

1065
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:36,390
I called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.

1066
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:40,687
Oh, I forgot to tell you
we were fired.

1067
01:12:40,812 --> 01:12:44,024
- Oh, no.
- You hated that job.

1068
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:45,543
Nice of your boss to tell
us where we could find you.

1069
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,985
Oh, no.

1070
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:52,490
Hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.

1071
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,164
The klane boys.
What an unpleasant surprise.

1072
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:02,752
Vince, this has
gone way beyond...

1073
01:13:02,835 --> 01:13:06,214
- A case of simple loan delinquency.
- We don't like being shot.

1074
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:09,383
Shot? Who shot you?

1075
01:13:09,509 --> 01:13:11,969
- What do you want?
- We want to take Vince...

1076
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:15,848
- Out to the parking lot and kill him.
- Ohhh, owww!

1077
01:13:15,932 --> 01:13:19,268
Don't you think
that's a little drastic?

1078
01:13:19,352 --> 01:13:21,020
Let's go.

1079
01:13:21,145 --> 01:13:23,105
Don't touch him.

1080
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,193
Ohhh!

1081
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:29,196
Hey, big fella.

1082
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,657
You wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you?

1083
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:34,493
You moved too soon.

1084
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:39,748
- What?
- The second rule in a crisis:

1085
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:42,584
Uh-oh. He's startin'
that funny talk, again.

1086
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:46,130
If you choose to bluff...

1087
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:48,216
You must be prepared
to have your bluff called.

1088
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,177
This is no bluff.

1089
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,555
These are my cousins,
Sam and Dave.

1090
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,057
Get these jerks outta here.

1091
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:14,410
I'm so proud of you.
I love when you hit people.

1092
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:18,664
You got a lot of rules, Jules.

1093
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:29,593
What a day.

1094
01:14:29,718 --> 01:14:33,263
First we visited
our birthplace...

1095
01:14:33,388 --> 01:14:35,432
Then we bought new clothes.

1096
01:14:35,473 --> 01:14:39,227
I got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.

1097
01:14:39,269 --> 01:14:42,814
- Then we danced the waltz.
- Yes, we did.

1098
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:46,026
- It's too bright.
- Then we got into a fight.

1099
01:14:46,109 --> 01:14:50,114
- We have this beautiful room.
- Perfect. Yes, it is beautiful.

1100
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:52,450
Life just doesn't
get better than this.

1101
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:56,621
- Oh, yes, it does. Good night.
- Where are you going?

1102
01:14:56,746 --> 01:15:00,208
I'm gonna go tuck Linda in
and maybe read her a bedtime story.

1103
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,461
Don't wait up for me.

1104
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:08,925
Tonight is your night, bro

1105
01:15:08,966 --> 01:15:10,927
it's your night, bro

1106
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:16,558
Oh, Vincent, you locked
yourself out.

1107
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:20,938
I- marnie.
- Hi.

1108
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,898
- Hi.
- Vince and Linda wanna be alone...

1109
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:26,235
So I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.

1110
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,697
You mean you're gonna sleep here tonight?
Uhhuh.

1111
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:33,785
Which bed should I take?

1112
01:15:36,162 --> 01:15:38,498
Either bed will be fine.

1113
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,500
I always sleep on the floo-

1114
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:53,513
- good night.
- Good night.

1115
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,905
Julius.

1116
01:16:13,325 --> 01:16:16,955
- Good night.
- Good night.

1117
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,932
- Oh, no.
- What?

1118
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:41,063
- What's the matter?
- This bed is lumpy.

1119
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:49,780
You mind if I share
the floor with you?

1120
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:20,939
You're teasing me, aren't you?

1121
01:17:21,022 --> 01:17:23,441
A little.

1122
01:17:25,944 --> 01:17:30,365
What do I do now?

1123
01:17:33,493 --> 01:17:35,453
We'll figure it out.

1124
01:17:38,414 --> 01:17:41,459
- Oh, Vince.
- Tonight is our night, bro

1125
01:17:41,584 --> 01:17:44,463
why are you doing that now?

1126
01:17:44,505 --> 01:17:46,423
Mom hasn't seen me
in all these years.

1127
01:17:46,549 --> 01:17:48,842
I wanna look my best.

1128
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:52,137
Tonight - your mom's gonna
love you whatever you look like.

1129
01:17:52,263 --> 01:17:54,139
And you look really good.

1130
01:17:54,265 --> 01:17:56,642
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1131
01:17:56,767 --> 01:18:00,855
So like this. One, two, three.

1132
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,857
Are you a little nervous?

1133
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:04,860
27, 28, no, 29.

1134
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:07,487
- Just a little.
- Nine, ten.

1135
01:18:07,571 --> 01:18:09,489
- Linda.
- What?

1136
01:18:09,614 --> 01:18:13,618
Like, what if she's
disappointed in me?

1137
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:16,496
If she's disappointed,
then she's a fake.

1138
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:19,875
I don't know what else
a mom could want in a son.

1139
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,878
- Huh?
- You're right.

1140
01:18:23,003 --> 01:18:25,882
You're right, you're right.
Why am I worried?

1141
01:18:26,007 --> 01:18:27,884
- What am I worried about?
- I don't know.

1142
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:29,969
You got it all.

1143
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:35,558
- I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
- Yeah.

1144
01:18:35,683 --> 01:18:38,394
You know, I've been thinking...

1145
01:18:38,519 --> 01:18:42,023
- That when we get back...
- Yeah?

1146
01:18:42,106 --> 01:18:44,358
I think we should
move in together.

1147
01:18:44,442 --> 01:18:46,360
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1148
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:48,739
- Oh, no, no.
- It's not "oh, no."

1149
01:18:48,864 --> 01:18:50,866
- It's not no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1150
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:53,160
I don't want to get married
and it's not that I wanna...

1151
01:18:53,285 --> 01:18:55,704
Keep track of you,
because I don't need to.

1152
01:18:55,829 --> 01:18:59,208
I just wanna live with you.

1153
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,877
It'd be fun.

1154
01:19:01,919 --> 01:19:05,005
Linda, look at me.

1155
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:07,049
Do I look like somebody
who could play house?

1156
01:19:07,174 --> 01:19:10,178
I'm cranky in the morning,
I'm grouchy in the afternoon...

1157
01:19:10,261 --> 01:19:12,680
I'm moody at night,
I'm like miserable.

1158
01:19:12,764 --> 01:19:15,099
I know what you're like.

1159
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:19,270
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Sleep on it.

1160
01:19:19,395 --> 01:19:21,814
- Okay, one night.
- This is going to be great.

1161
01:19:21,898 --> 01:19:25,610
Tomorrow I'm taking my best girl
to meet my mom. I'm so excited.

1162
01:19:25,735 --> 01:19:29,364
- Your best girl?
- Yeah, you, you.

1163
01:19:29,405 --> 01:19:31,126
Linda, there's no other girls.
Not any more.

1164
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:32,868
Yeah?

1165
01:19:32,952 --> 01:19:37,289
- Just you.
- There better not be. Know why?

1166
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:42,628
- Why?
- 'Cause I only have eyes for you

1167
01:19:46,966 --> 01:19:48,926
- that sounds familiar.
- It's a good song.

1168
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:50,928
You like that song, huh?

1169
01:19:51,011 --> 01:19:56,017
And I only have eyes

1170
01:19:56,101 --> 01:20:03,108
for you she-bop she-bop

1171
01:20:03,191 --> 01:20:05,110
she-bop she-bop

1172
01:20:07,571 --> 01:20:09,114
she-bop she-bop

1173
01:20:09,197 --> 01:20:15,997
I only have eyes for you
she-bop she-bop

1174
01:20:17,373 --> 01:20:19,792
she-bop she-bop

1175
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:22,962
just for you
she-bop she-bop

1176
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:38,186
oh, it's huge.

1177
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,188
Oh, it's beautiful.

1178
01:20:40,314 --> 01:20:42,191
Not to mention valuable.

1179
01:20:42,316 --> 01:20:44,693
Real estate like this
is worth a fortune.

1180
01:20:44,776 --> 01:20:46,778
You mustn't always
think about money.

1181
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,072
You got me all wrong, Julius.

1182
01:20:50,741 --> 01:20:53,702
I'm just saying
it's nice mom's loaded.

1183
01:20:53,785 --> 01:20:57,248
That's a worry she won't
have to have in her old age.

1184
01:20:57,332 --> 01:20:59,209
Hello, can I help you?

1185
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:02,003
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, um, excuse me.

1186
01:21:02,128 --> 01:21:03,963
We are looking for
Mary Ann Benedict, please.

1187
01:21:04,005 --> 01:21:06,507
I'm sorry, but
that's not possible.

1188
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,843
Look, we've come a long way.

1189
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:12,889
And believe me, she's gonna
be very happy to see us.

1190
01:21:13,014 --> 01:21:17,185
You're gonna have to write to the
Benedict foundation stating your business.

1191
01:21:17,227 --> 01:21:19,230
I'm sorry. Good day.

1192
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:28,197
- Foundation?
- Millions, Julius.

1193
01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:30,115
Mama's rich.
We gotta go see her.

1194
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:31,867
Buckaroos.

1195
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:34,370
- Let's get in there. We gotta talk to her.
- We sneak in.

1196
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:36,830
- How is it?
- Yeah, it's clear. Throw me over.

1197
01:21:36,914 --> 01:21:38,874
Okay.

1198
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:45,048
Vince? Vince, are you okay?

1199
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:47,050
Yeah, shut up. Come on, come on.

1200
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,785
What a lovely day.

1201
01:22:16,747 --> 01:22:21,085
Hey, Vincent, don't you
think this is mama?

1202
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:25,632
It could be. Yeah.

1203
01:22:25,757 --> 01:22:28,927
Don't just stand there.
Go introduce yourselves.

1204
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,262
Hey!

1205
01:22:30,304 --> 01:22:33,807
- Should you people be here?
- Uh-oh.

1206
01:22:33,932 --> 01:22:37,811
That depends on how you feel
personally about trespassing.

1207
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:40,480
Does he always try
to be funny like that?

1208
01:22:40,606 --> 01:22:44,569
- We're looking for miss Mary Ann Benedict.
- Yeah.

1209
01:22:44,694 --> 01:22:48,114
- Is she here?
- Yeah, she's here.

1210
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:50,658
She's here!

1211
01:22:50,783 --> 01:22:53,494
Sneaking in like that,
I should call the police.

1212
01:22:53,578 --> 01:22:55,830
No, no, no. You don't want
to do anything like that.

1213
01:22:55,955 --> 01:23:00,418
This is not your everyday,
average situation.

1214
01:23:08,344 --> 01:23:10,763
She's our mother, is the thing.

1215
01:23:10,804 --> 01:23:13,349
- We're her sons.
- Twin sons.

1216
01:23:16,435 --> 01:23:18,646
You're comedians.

1217
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:23,484
No. - No. We-we're
kind of a surprise.

1218
01:23:23,567 --> 01:23:27,489
I'll bet you are. Follow me.

1219
01:23:33,328 --> 01:23:36,373
- We were right.
- Lt is her.

1220
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:45,423
Excuse me.

1221
01:23:47,175 --> 01:23:49,345
- We thought that this is-
- Mary Ann Benedict?

1222
01:23:49,387 --> 01:23:52,348
This is an artists' colony.
There are a lot of painters.

1223
01:23:52,473 --> 01:23:56,060
Come on.

1224
01:23:57,562 --> 01:23:59,981
I can't wait to meet her.

1225
01:24:00,022 --> 01:24:02,149
- Yeah.
- It's gotta be amazing.

1226
01:24:02,191 --> 01:24:05,152
Look. Mary Ann Benedict
never understood...

1227
01:24:05,236 --> 01:24:07,947
Why people wanted
to buy her paintings.

1228
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:11,034
But for a brief period,
they were considered valuable.

1229
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:14,496
She used the money
to buy whispering pines.

1230
01:24:16,456 --> 01:24:18,625
May I ask you a question?

1231
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:22,713
Why do you keep referring
to her in the past tense?

1232
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:28,051
Because... She passed
away some time ago.

1233
01:24:29,887 --> 01:24:32,265
She passed-

1234
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:35,643
you jus-you just said
she was here.

1235
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:40,064
I meant, her spirit.
Her spirit is always here.

1236
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:45,361
Come on.

1237
01:25:10,387 --> 01:25:13,933
Can we get the hell
out of here, please?

1238
01:25:16,436 --> 01:25:19,189
Those damn real estate developers!

1239
01:25:19,272 --> 01:25:22,776
They won't be happy until
they turn this into a golf course.

1240
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:25,445
Oh, is that who they were?

1241
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,281
They're shameless.
They'll try anything.

1242
01:25:30,283 --> 01:25:34,120
Do you know those men claim
to be my twin sons?

1243
01:25:34,204 --> 01:25:36,373
- If you can believe that!
- What?

1244
01:25:36,456 --> 01:25:39,126
It was really quite upsetting.

1245
01:25:39,252 --> 01:25:41,462
Mary Ann, I am sorry.

1246
01:25:41,587 --> 01:25:43,798
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

1247
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:46,133
You get over things.

1248
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:50,888
I did have a child once.

1249
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:53,808
But he died at birth.

1250
01:25:59,606 --> 01:26:02,359
You should be proud of her.

1251
01:26:02,484 --> 01:26:04,653
She donates her house, land...

1252
01:26:04,736 --> 01:26:07,155
And all her paintings
to young artists.

1253
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:10,284
Linda, do I look like
a young artist?

1254
01:26:10,325 --> 01:26:13,495
All she meant... I know what
she meant, and why she's here.

1255
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:16,081
It's got nothing to do
with finding my mother...

1256
01:26:16,164 --> 01:26:18,292
And everything to do with money.

1257
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:22,297
- That's not true and you know it.
- Bullshit!

1258
01:26:22,338 --> 01:26:25,383
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

1259
01:26:25,508 --> 01:26:28,344
Look who decided to chime in!

1260
01:26:28,386 --> 01:26:30,346
The creature from
the black lagoon.

1261
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:32,640
I should've had my head
examined listening to you.

1262
01:26:32,765 --> 01:26:34,726
A deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity...

1263
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:37,520
And I'm out looking
for a dead mother.

1264
01:26:37,604 --> 01:26:39,082
All I wanted was to
make us into a family.

1265
01:26:39,106 --> 01:26:40,607
Family, my butt!

1266
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:42,902
There's no family here.

1267
01:26:43,027 --> 01:26:45,863
There's nothin' here
except me and three losers.

1268
01:26:45,988 --> 01:26:48,115
I don't know
why I listen to people.

1269
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,534
- I don't know why I do it.
- Cut it out.

1270
01:26:50,618 --> 01:26:52,578
Vince!

1271
01:26:52,703 --> 01:26:54,580
- I'm leaving.
- No, stop!

1272
01:26:54,663 --> 01:26:56,749
Stop! What are you doing?

1273
01:26:56,874 --> 01:26:59,543
You're acting
like a fourth-grader.

1274
01:26:59,668 --> 01:27:02,713
Where do you think you're going?

1275
01:27:02,796 --> 01:27:06,051
He dumped us in
the middle of new Mexico.

1276
01:27:06,176 --> 01:27:10,430
I can't-Julius!

1277
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:12,933
You don't know this...

1278
01:27:13,058 --> 01:27:15,810
And I promised Vince
that I wouldn't tell you...

1279
01:27:15,936 --> 01:27:19,689
But he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.

1280
01:27:19,773 --> 01:27:24,569
I'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.

1281
01:27:28,991 --> 01:27:31,577
Okay, yeah. Yes, Mr beetroot.

1282
01:27:31,702 --> 01:27:36,165
Yeah, I'll find it. Yeah.

1283
01:27:36,249 --> 01:27:38,251
Yes, I have a map.

1284
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,419
All right. I'll see you there.

1285
01:27:40,545 --> 01:27:42,672
See you in Houston
in the morning.

1286
01:27:42,797 --> 01:27:45,258
I'll be looking forward to it.

1287
01:27:45,383 --> 01:27:47,928
What a coincidence.

1288
01:27:48,053 --> 01:27:49,972
That was our friend.

1289
01:27:50,055 --> 01:27:53,433
Looks like I'm gonna be
doing business with... him.

1290
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:54,810
Sorry.

1291
01:27:54,935 --> 01:27:57,229
I would have done
the same thing.

1292
01:27:57,312 --> 01:28:00,774
You want the merchandise.
It's not your problem who delivers.

1293
01:28:00,857 --> 01:28:02,651
Precisely.

1294
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,035
But how will you find him?

1295
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,079
I have him in my head.

1296
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:16,875
I found him once,
I'll find him again.

1297
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,294
I hope so. Bye.

1298
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,629
Be careful.

1299
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,132
Brother to brother

1300
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:28,970
brother to brother

1301
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,059
one to another

1302
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:37,104
like no other

1303
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:41,317
brother to brother
brother to brother

1304
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,111
never knew you existed

1305
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:46,447
never saw you in my dreams

1306
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,741
if there were signs
I must've missed 'em

1307
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:51,328
who would I believe

1308
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:53,663
now all of a sudden

1309
01:28:53,788 --> 01:28:55,832
we're sharing this skin

1310
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:58,460
like a shadow you stick to me

1311
01:28:58,543 --> 01:29:01,004
through every jam I'm in

1312
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:03,673
brother to brother

1313
01:29:03,798 --> 01:29:07,802
you took me by the hand
brother to brother

1314
01:29:07,844 --> 01:29:11,681
you helped me understand
one to another

1315
01:29:11,765 --> 01:29:14,852
there'll never be another no, no

1316
01:29:14,977 --> 01:29:20,024
brother to brother my brother

1317
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:25,112
when I felt like a zero

1318
01:29:26,447 --> 01:29:29,700
you became my hero

1319
01:29:29,784 --> 01:29:32,203
one to another

1320
01:29:32,286 --> 01:29:35,374
you have been my brother

1321
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:39,211
my brother whoa

1322
01:29:39,336 --> 01:29:40,504
brother to brother

1323
01:29:41,588 --> 01:29:45,050
when I was up against the wall

1324
01:29:45,133 --> 01:29:47,719
about to take a really big fall

1325
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:00,900
sorry I'm late.

1326
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:05,154
- The directions you gave me weren't-
- Step back.

1327
01:30:07,865 --> 01:30:10,410
Get over here.

1328
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:13,121
I'm unarmed.

1329
01:30:13,246 --> 01:30:15,290
He's clean.

1330
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:18,752
Oh, oh. Isn't that pretty!

1331
01:30:18,877 --> 01:30:20,754
Yeah, it is.

1332
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:24,133
- Did you come here alone, unarmed?
- Yeah.

1333
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:26,260
You're just some fool
who stole a car?

1334
01:30:26,302 --> 01:30:29,930
Yeah, I guess I am.

1335
01:30:30,014 --> 01:30:32,850
You don't know what
the hell this is, do you?

1336
01:30:32,933 --> 01:30:35,936
No.

1337
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:39,608
Revolutionary fuel-injection
system for jets.

1338
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:42,611
Worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.

1339
01:30:42,694 --> 01:30:46,948
Somebody else developed it,
but I just had to have it.

1340
01:30:47,073 --> 01:30:49,326
Crafty devil, huh?

1341
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:52,621
What are you waiting for?

1342
01:30:53,955 --> 01:30:55,957
Wait a minute, beetroot!

1343
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:58,710
- I thought we had a deal.
- We do.

1344
01:31:08,387 --> 01:31:10,473
Five million bucks!

1345
01:31:10,598 --> 01:31:13,643
- You wanna count it?
- No, no.

1346
01:31:13,726 --> 01:31:18,481
- But I could use a lift to town.
- Don't press your luck.

1347
01:31:18,522 --> 01:31:20,483
Okay. That's all right.

1348
01:31:20,566 --> 01:31:24,488
I gassed it up for you,
beetroot. Thank you!

1349
01:31:24,571 --> 01:31:29,493
Five million dollars!
Five million bucks!

1350
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:32,871
Ha-ha-ha! Five million bucks!

1351
01:31:32,996 --> 01:31:35,582
I've gotta look at it!

1352
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:39,836
Uh-oh.

1353
01:32:20,212 --> 01:32:22,506
Hey, Benedict!

1354
01:32:22,548 --> 01:32:25,426
All I want is the money.

1355
01:32:25,551 --> 01:32:29,431
Just give me what's mine
and I'll leave you alone.

1356
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:08,763
Steps! Steps!

1357
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:22,611
Leave my brother alone.

1358
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:26,323
No.

1359
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:28,325
Julius.

1360
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,621
No, no, no.

1361
01:33:31,746 --> 01:33:34,540
No, no.

1362
01:33:37,418 --> 01:33:40,797
Julius, you're-you're here?

1363
01:33:40,838 --> 01:33:43,299
No. No, you idiot.

1364
01:33:43,383 --> 01:33:45,635
Don't be nervous.

1365
01:33:45,677 --> 01:33:49,055
I hate violence.
Plus I never carry a gun.

1366
01:33:49,138 --> 01:33:51,724
Who are you?

1367
01:33:51,808 --> 01:33:53,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1368
01:33:53,936 --> 01:33:55,896
Put the gun down.
I got the money.

1369
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:58,816
Here's your money.
Here's your money.

1370
01:33:58,857 --> 01:34:01,986
Here's the money.

1371
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:04,572
You're a goddamned millionaire.

1372
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:10,661
You, I am never
gonna forgive... never.

1373
01:34:10,744 --> 01:34:14,331
- Open it.
- Open it?

1374
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:17,877
You were going to get killed.

1375
01:34:18,003 --> 01:34:19,814
I was trying to distract
him so you could escape.

1376
01:34:19,838 --> 01:34:21,673
I already had escaped!

1377
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:25,302
I was halfway to Brazil
when I felt you!

1378
01:34:25,343 --> 01:34:28,555
- Close it.
- Close it?

1379
01:34:28,638 --> 01:34:30,724
Open it, close it.
Open it, close it.

1380
01:34:30,849 --> 01:34:34,519
- Why didn't you go?
- Why didn't I go?

1381
01:34:34,644 --> 01:34:38,399
Because thanks to you,
I'm not only a goddamned psychic-

1382
01:34:38,524 --> 01:34:40,026
Benedict!

1383
01:34:40,109 --> 01:34:42,695
- I think the case belongs to me.
- Oh, sorry.

1384
01:34:42,737 --> 01:34:46,866
I got this disease
called a conscience.

1385
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:50,578
- No one ever said being good was easy.
- "No one ever said-"

1386
01:34:50,703 --> 01:34:52,204
will you two shut up!

1387
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:55,041
Butt out, pal!
You got your money.

1388
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:58,211
Now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.

1389
01:34:58,253 --> 01:35:00,505
Try Brazil.

1390
01:35:00,547 --> 01:35:03,926
It doesn't work that way.
You've seen my face.

1391
01:35:04,051 --> 01:35:06,219
Which one's first?

1392
01:35:06,345 --> 01:35:10,182
You gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money?

1393
01:35:10,224 --> 01:35:11,725
You got it.

1394
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:15,354
Wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.

1395
01:35:15,395 --> 01:35:18,774
- The third rule?
- Third rule?

1396
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:21,778
Yeah, third rule.

1397
01:35:25,907 --> 01:35:27,784
Oooh!

1398
01:35:27,867 --> 01:35:31,120
- The third rule.
- What's the third rule?

1399
01:35:31,204 --> 01:35:32,789
Duck!

1400
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:05,115
Yo!

1401
01:36:05,156 --> 01:36:08,118
Holy-shmoly!

1402
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:16,626
Now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.

1403
01:36:19,629 --> 01:36:22,299
Thanks for coming back, Vincent.

1404
01:36:22,382 --> 01:36:25,303
We're brothers, right?

1405
01:36:25,428 --> 01:36:27,638
- We're family.
- That's right.

1406
01:36:30,558 --> 01:36:33,019
A rich family.

1407
01:36:33,102 --> 01:36:35,521
- A good family.
- What? What?

1408
01:36:35,646 --> 01:36:38,190
- We're gonna return this money.
- No.

1409
01:36:38,316 --> 01:36:40,484
- We don't have to give it back.
- Yes, we do.

1410
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,653
- Why? Why?
- We have to, believe me.

1411
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:49,161
- Mary Ann?
- Hmm?

1412
01:36:49,244 --> 01:36:52,414
I think you'd better come
take a look at this.

1413
01:36:52,497 --> 01:36:55,792
What is it?

1414
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,863
Mary Ann?

1415
01:37:23,988 --> 01:37:28,034
What a pleasant surprise.

1416
01:37:30,663 --> 01:37:33,666
You stole my family.

1417
01:37:33,707 --> 01:37:36,877
You lying son of a bitch.

1418
01:37:42,675 --> 01:37:45,052
Linda, I'm sorry.

1419
01:37:45,177 --> 01:37:47,721
I made a terrible mistake
and I apologize.

1420
01:37:47,805 --> 01:37:50,517
I- all I'm asking for
is another chance.

1421
01:37:50,642 --> 01:37:52,560
I know I don't deserve this-

1422
01:37:52,686 --> 01:37:54,854
that's right,
you don't deserve it.

1423
01:38:10,161 --> 01:38:12,123
Vince?

1424
01:38:26,429 --> 01:38:29,890
Yes, this is the
Benedict corporation.

1425
01:38:29,932 --> 01:38:33,102
We are a consulting firm...
A think tank.

1426
01:38:33,227 --> 01:38:36,440
Something like
the rand corporation.

1427
01:38:36,565 --> 01:38:38,942
- Only smarter.
- Only smarter.

1428
01:38:39,067 --> 01:38:41,111
Tomorrow at 3:00.

1429
01:38:41,236 --> 01:38:44,615
Yes, I'll put you down.

1430
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,575
Good night, mr benedicts.

1431
01:38:46,658 --> 01:38:48,785
- Good night.
- Good night.

1432
01:38:48,827 --> 01:38:52,623
That's it.
The last cheque is written.

1433
01:38:52,748 --> 01:38:56,127
What do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward?

1434
01:38:56,169 --> 01:38:59,088
After we've paid off
all our debts...

1435
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:02,050
We have exactly $12,278.

1436
01:39:02,133 --> 01:39:05,929
- $12,278. That's terrible.
- What?

1437
01:39:06,012 --> 01:39:08,932
You're just upset because
I made you return that suitcase.

1438
01:39:11,809 --> 01:39:15,313
Oh, the money.

1439
01:39:15,438 --> 01:39:17,816
You mean the
four million dollars.

1440
01:39:19,068 --> 01:39:21,487
Four million dollars.
Just say it.

1441
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:24,823
Say it... Four million dollars.

1442
01:39:24,907 --> 01:39:27,493
It's a lot of money, Jules.

1443
01:39:27,618 --> 01:39:30,829
Vincent...
I'm very proud of you.

1444
01:39:30,955 --> 01:39:38,505
Well... Yeah, I'm kinda
proud of myself.

1445
01:39:38,588 --> 01:39:41,967
Isn't it great to be one
of the good guys for a change?

1446
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:45,178
It feels great to be a good guy!

1447
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:48,348
You're a great guy, too.
You came back for me, huh?

1448
01:39:48,431 --> 01:39:51,643
- You did steal a car though.
- I borrowed one.

1449
01:39:51,726 --> 01:39:55,105
I brought it back the next day.
I explained it to the man.

1450
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:57,023
He was a cowboy.

1451
01:39:57,107 --> 01:40:00,111
Excuse me? I'm-

1452
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:03,864
oh, my God. I don't even know
which one is which.

1453
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:10,538
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1454
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:13,916
You see, I didn't
believe your story.

1455
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:17,044
Who would believe
a crazy story like that?

1456
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:23,594
They lied to me all these years.

1457
01:40:23,677 --> 01:40:26,763
They lied to you, too.

1458
01:40:33,854 --> 01:40:37,065
You found each other.

1459
01:40:43,573 --> 01:40:45,742
Now you found me.

1460
01:41:05,346 --> 01:41:07,264
Mama?

1461
01:41:08,933 --> 01:41:10,267
Mama!

1462
01:41:12,311 --> 01:41:13,812
Mama!

1463
01:41:13,938 --> 01:41:16,273
Oh, mama!

1464
01:41:34,542 --> 01:41:36,836
Good.

1465
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,172
Tickets?

1466
01:41:39,297 --> 01:41:41,174
Thanks. This is gonna be great.

1467
01:41:41,299 --> 01:41:44,135
I just can't get over
how alike they are.

1468
01:41:44,177 --> 01:41:47,305
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

1469
01:42:19,172 --> 01:42:23,176
Twins united outside and in

1470
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,137
mm-mm, uh-huh

1471
01:42:26,179 --> 01:42:28,181
when you're twins

1472
01:42:28,265 --> 01:42:31,394
the magic just never ends

1473
01:42:33,688 --> 01:42:37,233
what happened to you
hey, I could feel it

1474
01:42:37,358 --> 01:42:40,862
I smile and I cry
without knowing why

1475
01:42:40,987 --> 01:42:44,532
your joy and your pain
would be so real

1476
01:42:44,616 --> 01:42:48,620
I felt like my life
was happenin' again

1477
01:42:48,745 --> 01:42:52,332
and now I know it's
'cause you're part of me

1478
01:42:52,373 --> 01:42:55,878
wasn't my choice
it was meant to be

1479
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:59,590
we were connected
even when apart

1480
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:03,218
we got together
now the real problems start

1481
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:07,139
twins united outside and in

1482
01:43:07,222 --> 01:43:09,600
yeah

1483
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:12,019
when you're twins

1484
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:14,898
the magic just never ends

1485
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:22,822
if one me is good
then two is better

1486
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:26,660
well, I can't complain
'cause I'm ahead of the game

1487
01:43:26,743 --> 01:43:30,247
we split the pain
double the pleasure

1488
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:33,917
I'm starting to feel
life gave us a deal

1489
01:43:34,042 --> 01:43:37,922
no, we're not just
your average family

1490
01:43:38,047 --> 01:43:41,592
got benefits
most people never see

1491
01:43:41,676 --> 01:43:45,263
and if I had a chance
to live again

1492
01:43:45,304 --> 01:43:48,599
I wouldn't want it
unless I was your twin

1493
01:43:48,641 --> 01:43:53,437
twins united outside and in

1494
01:43:53,479 --> 01:43:55,356
ah, yeah

1495
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:57,609
when you're twins

1496
01:43:57,693 --> 01:44:00,737
the magic just never ends

1497
01:44:00,779 --> 01:44:03,031
ah, yeah

1498
01:44:03,115 --> 01:44:07,619
twins united outside and in

1499
01:44:07,703 --> 01:44:08,954
mm-mm, uh-huh

1500
01:44:09,955 --> 01:44:12,291
when you're twins

1501
01:44:12,374 --> 01:44:15,460
the magic just never ends

1502
01:44:17,629 --> 01:44:21,134
twins

1503
01:44:39,652 --> 01:44:41,447
twins
