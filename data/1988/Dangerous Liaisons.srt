1
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,020
Sequence.

2
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,316
Well, my dear...

3
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,569
So how are you adapting
to the world outside?

4
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,237
Very well, I think.

5
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,117
I've advised her to watch and learn
and be quiet except when spoken to.

6
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,873
So we must see what we can devise
for your amusement.

7
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,134
Valmont is here.

8
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,637
You receive him, do you?

9
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,139
Yes.

10
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,891
So do you.

11
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,397
Monsieur le Vicomte de Valmont,
my child...

12
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,483
...whom you very probably
don't remember...

13
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,027
...except that he is
conspicuously charming...

14
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,198
...never opens his mouth without first
calculating what damage he can do.

15
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,700
Then why do you receive him,
maman?

16
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,078
Everyone receives him.

17
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,554
Madame.

18
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,598
What a pleasant surprise.

19
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,976
Madame de Volanges.
How delightful to see you.

20
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,980
You remember my daughter, Cécile?

21
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,110
Well, indeed, but who could have
foretold she would flower so gracefully?

22
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,906
I wanted to call on you
before leaving the city.

23
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,949
Oh...

24
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,285
I'm not sure we can allow that.
Why should you want to leave?

25
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,204
Paris in August, you know...

26
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,415
...and it's time I paid a visit on my aunt.

27
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,625
I've neglected her disgracefully.

28
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,293
Madame de Rosemonde
has been good enough...

29
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,796
...to invite us to stay at the château.

30
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,715
Won't you please give her
our warmest regards?

31
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,135
I shall make a point of it, Madame.

32
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,139
I think it's time we took you home.

33
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,934
I'm used to being in bed
by nine at the convent.

34
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,602
So I should hope.

35
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,414
Your aunt?

36
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,915
That's correct.

37
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,086
I thought she'd already made
arrangements to leave you all her money.

38
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,468
Do you know why I summoned you
here this evening?

39
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,180
I'd hoped it might be for
the pleasure of my company.

40
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,764
I need you...

41
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,309
...to carry out an heroic enterprise.

42
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,396
You remember when Bastide left me?

43
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,355
Yes.

44
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,483
And went off with that fat mistress
of yours whose name escapes me.

45
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,735
Yes, yes.

46
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,988
No one has ever done that to me before.
Or to you, I suspect.

47
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,616
I was quite relieved to be rid of her,
frankly.

48
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,117
No, you weren't.

49
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,790
For some years now,
Bastide has been searching for a wife.

50
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,587
He was always unshakably prejudiced
in favour of convent education.

51
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,089
And now he's found the ideal candidate.

52
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,052
Cécile Volanges.

53
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,720
Very good.

54
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,642
And her 60,000 a year.

55
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,604
That must have played some small part
in Bastide's calculations.

56
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,689
None whatsoever.

57
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,609
Bastide's priority, you see...

58
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,111
... is a guaranteed virtue.

59
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,617
I wonder if I'm beginning to guess
what it is you're intending to propose.

60
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,665
Bastide is with his regiment in Corsica
for the rest of the year.

61
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,000
That should give you plenty of time.

62
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,879
You mean to...?

63
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,925
- She's a rosebud.
- You think so?

64
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,843
And he'd get back from his honeymoon...

65
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,388
...to find himself the laughing stock
of Paris.

66
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,640
- Well...
- Yes.

67
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,811
Love and revenge. Two of your favourites.

68
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,816
No, I can't.

69
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,693
What?

70
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,403
Oh really, I can't.

71
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,905
- Why not?
- Oh, it's too easy.

72
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,492
It is.

73
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,868
She's seen nothing.

74
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,913
She knows nothing.
She's bound to be curious.

75
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,415
She'd be on her back...

76
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,543
...before you'd unwrapped
the first bunch of flowers.

77
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,588
Any one of a dozen men could manage it.

78
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,216
I have my reputation to think of.

79
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,686
I can see I'm going to have
to tell you everything.

80
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,521
- Of course you are.
- Yes.

81
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,442
My aunt is not on her own
just at the moment.

82
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,986
She has a young friend staying with her.

83
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,322
Madame de Tourvel.

84
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,202
You can't mean it.

85
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,957
To seduce a woman famous
for strict morals...

86
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,335
...religious fervour and the happiness
of her marriage...

87
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,213
What could possibly be more prestigious?

88
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,384
I think there's something degrading
about having a husband for a rival.

89
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,263
It's humiliating if you fail,
and commonplace if you succeed.

90
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,099
Where is Monsieur de Tourvel anyway?

91
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,643
Presiding over some
endless case in Burgundy.

92
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,188
I don't think you can hope
for any actual pleasure.

93
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,439
Oh, yes.

94
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,776
You see, I have no intention
of breaking down her prejudices.

95
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,906
I want her to believe in God and virtue
and the sanctity of marriage...

96
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,450
...and still not be able to stop herself.

97
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,288
I want the excitement of watching her...

98
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,374
...betray everything that's
most important to her.

99
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,543
Surely you understand that.

100
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,837
I thought "betrayal"
was your favourite word.

101
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,589
No, no...

102
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,883
..."cruelty. "

103
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,221
I always think that has a nobler ring to it.

104
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,106
- How is Belleroche?
- I'm very pleased with him.

105
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,484
And is he your only lover?

106
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,946
Yes.

107
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,114
I think you should take another.

108
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,659
I think it most unhealthy, this exclusivity.

109
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,910
You're not jealous, are you?

110
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,579
Of course I am.
Belleroche is completely undeserving.

111
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,665
I thought he was one
of your closest friends.

112
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,501
Exactly, so I know what I'm talking about.

113
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,967
No,
I think you should organise an infidelity.

114
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,219
With me, for example.

115
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,226
You refuse me a simple favour...

116
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,269
...then you expect to be indulged?

117
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,190
It's only because it is so simple.
It wouldn't feel like a conquest.

118
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,818
I have to follow my destiny.

119
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,569
I have to be true...

120
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,072
...to my profession.

121
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,579
All right then.

122
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,834
Come back when you've succeeded
with Madame de Tourvel.

123
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:51,961
Yes.

124
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,255
And I will offer you...

125
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,507
...a reward.

126
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,092
My love.

127
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,137
But I shall require proof.

128
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,722
Certainly.

129
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,890
Written proof.

130
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,812
Not negotiable.

131
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,865
I don't suppose there's
any possibility of an advance?

132
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,829
Goodnight, Vicomte.

133
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,852
Where have you been?

134
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,524
Time has no logic when I'm not with you.

135
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,568
An hour is like a century.

136
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,906
I've told you before,
we shall get on a great deal better...

137
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,327
...if you make a concerted effort
not to sound like the latest novel.

138
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,554
It's such a beautiful day,
I believe we'll walk.

139
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,144
You didn't take the sacrament today.

140
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,187
No.

141
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,314
May I ask why?

142
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,778
I have this appalling reputation,
as you may know.

143
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,072
Yes, I have been warned about you.

144
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,116
You have? By whom?

145
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,285
A friend.

146
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,751
The fact is I've spent my life
surrounded by immoral people.

147
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,295
I've allowed myself
to be influenced by them...

148
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,632
...and sometimes even taken pride
in outshining them.

149
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,592
- And now?
- Now...

150
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:49,138
...what I most often feel is unworthiness.

151
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,976
But it is precisely at such moments
that you start to become worthy.

152
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:04,028
I certainly believe one should
constantly strive to improve oneself.

153
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,812
Chevalier...

154
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,858
...I don't believe you know my cousin,
Madame de Volanges.

155
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,485
This is Chevalier Danceny.

156
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,946
And Madame's daughter, Cécile.

157
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,699
Tell us what we should think of the opera.

158
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,661
It's sublime, don't you find?

159
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,373
Monsieur Danceny is one
of those rare eccentrics...

160
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,042
...who come here to listen to the music.

161
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,715
I do look forward to our next meeting.

162
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,351
Charming young man...

163
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,228
...penniless, regrettably.

164
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,399
He's one of the finest
music teachers in the city.

165
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,320
Perhaps you should employ him.

166
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,823
How are you getting on
with Madame de Tourvel's maid?

167
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,409
Julie, to tell you the truth, sir,
it's been a bit boring.

168
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,786
If I wasn't so anxious to keep
Your Lordship abreast...

169
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,288
...I think I'd have only bothered the once.

170
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,374
Still, what else is there to do
in the country?

171
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,545
It wasn't so much the details
of your intimacy I was after...

172
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,799
...it's whether or not she's agreed
to bring me Madame de Tourvel's letters.

173
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,343
- She won't steal the letters, sir.
- She won't?

174
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,511
You know better than me, sir.

175
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,597
It's easy enough making them do
what they want to do.

176
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,515
It's trying to get them to do
what you want them to do...

177
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,767
...that gives you a headache.

178
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,393
And them, as often as not.

179
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,520
I need to know who's
writing to her about me.

180
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,814
I shouldn't worry if I was you, sir.

181
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,651
She told Julie she didn't believe
you went hunting in the mornings.

182
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,362
She said she was going
to have you followed.

183
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,365
So I'd say it was only a matter of time.

184
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,545
That is a terrible noise he's making.

185
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,964
He should get the news back
to her twice as quickly.

186
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,967
I don't think we should make it
too easy for him.

187
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,821
What exactly do you think you're doing?

188
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,156
I am impounding these effects, sir.

189
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,785
Has it not been explained to you?
Monsieur Armand is not well.

190
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,955
I don't make the laws, sir.
I just do what I'm told.

191
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,706
Everybody has to pay his taxes.

192
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,333
How much does he owe?

193
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,335
How much?

194
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,795
Fifty-six
livres.

195
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,672
- Pay him.
- Yes, my lord.

196
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,932
Monsieur Armand...

197
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,226
Excuse me, you don't know me.

198
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,728
Of course I do, Monsieur le Vicomte.

199
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,980
Please, don't get up.

200
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,149
- I have to. They're taking the bed.
- No, not at all.

201
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,902
No one's taking anything.

202
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,426
Just to tide you over. I insist.

203
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,013
Me, sir...

204
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,474
Fifty-six livres to save
an entire family from ruin.

205
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,059
That seems a genuine bargain.

206
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,228
These days, my lord,
you can find half a dozen like that...

207
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,813
...in any village in the country.

208
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,356
Really?

209
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,608
I must say the family was
very well chosen.

210
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,277
Solidly respectable...

211
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:41,281
...gratifyingly tearful,
no suspiciously pretty girls. Well done.

212
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,991
I do my best for you, sir.

213
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,201
And all that humble gratitude.
It was most affecting.

214
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,370
Certainly brought a tear to my eye.

215
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,164
That's from her husband.

216
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,839
This must be from
that officious friend of hers.

217
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,222
Tell me, where do you and Julie meet?

218
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,682
In my room, sir.

219
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,894
- And is she coming tonight?
- Afraid so.

220
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,064
I think I may be forced to burst in on you.

221
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,233
See if blackmail will succeed
any better than bribery.

222
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,943
About two o'clock suit you?

223
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,197
I don't want to embarrass you.
Will that give you enough time?

224
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,948
Ample, sir.

225
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,372
Is this true about Monsieur Armand?

226
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,459
I don't believe I know anyone
of that name.

227
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,002
You may as well own up, Monsieur.

228
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,504
My footman happened to be passing...

229
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,006
...when you were in the village
this morning.

230
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,593
I don't think you should pay too much
attention to servants' gossip.

231
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:45,720
It is true, isn't it?

232
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,224
Well...

233
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,809
...yes.

234
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,060
It is.

235
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,980
You dear boy,
come and let me give you a hug.

236
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,428
I can't understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous...

237
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,764
...could lead such a dissolute life.

238
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,226
I'm afraid you have an exaggerated idea...

239
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,604
...both of my generosity
and of my depravity.

240
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,024
If I knew who'd given you
such a dire account of me...

241
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,071
Since I don't...

242
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,825
...let me make a confession.

243
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:53,204
I'm afraid the key to the paradox lies
in a certain weakness of character.

244
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,626
I can't see how so thoughtful an act
of charity could be described as weak.

245
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,503
Because it was simply a response...

246
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,089
...to a strong new influence in my life.

247
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,299
Yours.

248
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,476
You see how weak I am?

249
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,397
I promised myself
I was never going to tell you.

250
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,649
It's just that looking at you...

251
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,359
You needn't worry...

252
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,069
...I have no illicit intentions.

253
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,864
I would not dream of insulting you.

254
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,952
But I do love you.

255
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,747
I adore you.

256
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,751
Please, help me.

257
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,768
- I rang a number of times.
- Didn't hear, sir.

258
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:41,813
- I require some hot water.
- Right away, sir.

259
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:43,856
Don't move.

260
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:50,196
- Azolan...
- Sir?

261
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,198
Wait for me in my room.

262
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,328
You know I can't condone
this sort of behaviour, Julie.

263
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:58,538
I know, sir.

264
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:01,499
- But, you may rely on my discretion.
- Thank you, sir.

265
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:04,836
Providing, of course,
that you agree to my price.

266
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:18,975
No. Nothing like that.

267
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,270
No, all I want is to get
to see every letter...

268
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:25,481
...that Madame de Tourvel
has received since her arrival here...

269
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,692
...and every letter that she writes
from now on.

270
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:28,943
But sir, I can't-

271
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:31,654
Deliver them to Azolan
by midnight tomorrow.

272
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,075
For your trouble.

273
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:45,645
Would it be very wrong of me
to answer Monsieur Danceny's letters?

274
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:49,023
- In the circumstances, yes.
- In what circumstances?

275
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,734
It's not my place to
tell you this, my dear...

276
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:54,153
...if I hadn't become so fond of you...

277
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:55,488
Go on, please.

278
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,698
Your marriage has been arranged.

279
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,868
- Who is it?
- Oh, someone I know slightly.

280
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,578
Monsieur le Comte de Bastide.

281
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,413
- What's he like?
- Well...

282
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:05,581
You don't like him?

283
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,751
Oh, it's not that. He's a man
of somewhat erratic judgement.

284
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,795
- And rather serious.
- How old is he?

285
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:14,840
- Thirty-six.
- Thirty-six! He's an old man.

286
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,968
Do you know when?

287
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,596
In the new year, I believe.

288
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:25,226
Maybe there's a way to let you
write to Monsieur Danceny.

289
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,061
Oh, Madame.

290
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,984
If you were to let me see both sides
of the correspondence...

291
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,903
...I could reassure myself.

292
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,365
But I can't show the letters
I've already sent him.

293
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,850
I trust you slept well, Madame.
I wish I could say that I had.

294
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,894
I thought the least I could hope for
was that you would respect me.

295
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,146
But I do, of course I do!

296
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:12,231
You've offended me deeply.
It's unforgivable.

297
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:15,526
This confirms everything
I've been told about you.

298
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,405
I'm beginning to think you may
have planned the whole exercise.

299
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:21,740
I had no idea you were staying here.

300
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:25,244
Not that it would have disturbed me
in the slightest if I had known.

301
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:29,290
You see, until I met you,
I had only ever experienced desire.

302
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,458
Love, never.

303
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,294
- That's enough.
- No, no...

304
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,753
...you've made an accusation.

305
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:37,631
You must allow me the opportunity
to defend myself.

306
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,426
I'm not going to deny
that I was aware of your beauty...

307
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:44,013
...but the point is,
this has nothing to do with your beauty.

308
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,515
As I got to know you, I began to realise...

309
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,310
...that beauty was the least
of your qualities.

310
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,687
I became fascinated by your goodness.

311
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,147
I was drawn in by it.

312
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,858
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

313
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:59,320
It was only when I began to feel
actual physical pain...

314
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:01,071
...every time you left the room...

315
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:03,908
...that it finally dawned on me.
I was in love.

316
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,037
...but that didn't matter to me.

317
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,749
It's not that I want to have you,
all I want is to deserve you.

318
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,127
Tell me what to do.

319
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,047
Show me how to behave.
I'll do anything you say.

320
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:23,093
Very well, then.
I would like you to leave this house.

321
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,848
I don't see why that should be necessary.

322
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,268
Let's just say you've spent
your whole life making it necessary.

323
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,438
And if you refuse,
I shall be forced to leave myself.

324
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,566
Well then, of course, whatever you say.

325
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:39,652
Thank you.

326
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:49,620
Perhaps I might be so bold
as to ask a favour in return?

327
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,289
I think it would only be
just to let me know...

328
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,500
...which of your friends
has blackened my name.

329
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,585
If friends of mine have warned me
against you...

330
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,088
...I could hardly reward them
with betrayal.

331
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:01,298
I must say,
you devalue your generous offer...

332
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,175
...if you want to use it
as a bargaining point.

333
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:05,135
Very well, I withdraw the request.

334
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:08,722
I hope you won't think I'm bargaining
if I ask you to let me write to you.

335
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,349
- Well-
- And pray that you will do me...

336
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,184
...the kindness of answering my letters.

337
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:14,103
I'm not sure a correspondence with you...

338
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:16,063
...is something a woman of honour
could permit herself.

339
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:18,816
You're determined to refuse
my suggestions, however respectable.

340
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,276
- I didn't say that.
- And you'd rather be unjust...

341
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,445
...than risk showing me
a touch of kindness?

342
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,197
I would welcome the chance
to prove to you...

343
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,992
...that what lies behind this
is not hatred or resentment but-

344
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,619
But what?

345
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,483
Listen to this:

346
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:05,487
"He knows exactly how far
he may venture without risk...

347
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,573
"... and guarantees his own security...

348
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:11,994
"... by tormenting only the safest kind
of victim: women. "

349
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,586
Madame de Volanges...

350
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,760
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye, dear boy.

351
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,852
- Monsieur, please...
- I'll write soon.

352
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,833
My dear Madame de Tourvel...

353
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:04,338
...I have just come...

354
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:07,132
Don't move, I said. -

355
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,262
...to my desk...

356
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:17,476
...in the middle of a stormy night...

357
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:20,562
...during which...

358
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:24,232
...I have been...

359
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:26,818
...tossed...

360
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:30,280
... from exultation...

361
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:34,201
... to exhaustion...

362
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:36,703
... and back again.

363
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:40,040
Y et, despite these torments...

364
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,086
... I guarantee that at this moment...

365
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:47,172
... I am far happier than you.

366
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:59,101
We'll finish it later, shall we?

367
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:07,734
Your damned cousin, the Volanges bitch...

368
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:09,820
...wanted me away
from Madame de Tourvel.

369
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:13,240
Well, now I am and I intend
to make her suffer for it.

370
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:18,328
Your plan, to ruin her daughter,
are you making any progress?

371
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,874
Is there anything I can do to help?

372
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,252
I'm entirely at your disposal.

373
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:28,422
Well...

374
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,048
...yes.

375
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,678
I told Danceny you would act
as his confidant and advisor.

376
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:38,849
I need you to stiffen his resolve,
if that's the phrase.

377
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:42,644
I thought if anyone could help him-

378
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:45,605
Help? He doesn't need help,
he needs hindrances.

379
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,566
If he has to climb over enough of them...

380
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,652
...he might inadvertently
fall on top of her.

381
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,405
I take it he hasn't been a great success.

382
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,323
He's been disastrous.

383
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:58,285
Like most intellectuals,
he's intensely stupid.

384
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,792
I often wonder how you managed
to invent yourself.

385
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:09,421
I had no choice, did I? I'm a woman.

386
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,842
Women are obliged to be
far more skillful than men.

387
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:18,513
You can ruin our reputation and our life
with a few well-chosen words.

388
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:21,475
So, of course,
I had to invent not only myself...

389
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:25,520
...but ways of escape
no one has ever thought of before.

390
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:28,773
And I've succeeded because...

391
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:34,404
...I've always known I was born
to dominate your sex and avenge my own.

392
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:39,284
Yes, but what I ask was, how?

393
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,044
When I came out into society I was 15.

394
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:53,131
I already knew that the role
I was condemned to...

395
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,134
...namely, to keep quiet
and do what I was told...

396
00:34:56,218 --> 00:35:00,013
...gave me the perfect
opportunity to listen and observe.

397
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:04,100
Not to what people told me,
which naturally was of no interest...

398
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:08,063
...but to whatever it was
they were trying to hide.

399
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:11,191
I practised detachment.

400
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:14,069
I learnt how to look cheerful
while under the table...

401
00:35:14,152 --> 00:35:16,821
...I stuck a fork into the back of my hand.

402
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,242
I became...

403
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:23,328
...a virtuoso of deceit.

404
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:26,623
It wasn't pleasure I was after,
it was knowledge.

405
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:31,211
I consulted the strictest moralist
to learn how to appear.

406
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,755
Philosophers, to find out what to think.

407
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,175
And novelists,
to see what I could get away with.

408
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:42,806
And in the end I distilled everything
to one wonderfully simple principle...

409
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,643
...win or die.

410
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,605
So, you're infallible, are you?

411
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:54,067
If I want a man, I have him.

412
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:57,404
If he wants to tell, he finds that he can't.

413
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:01,783
That's the whole story.

414
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,994
And was that our story?

415
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:11,584
I wanted you before we'd ever met.

416
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,546
My self-esteem demanded it.

417
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,299
Then when you began to pursue me...

418
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,219
...I wanted you so badly.

419
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:27,642
It's the only time I have ever been
controlled by my desire.

420
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,938
Single combat.

421
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,962
Madame de Volanges...

422
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,515
Your note said it was urgent.

423
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:11,227
It's days now. I haven't been able
to think of anything else.

424
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:15,398
Please, sit down.
I have reason to believe...

425
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:19,068
...that a... how should I describe it...

426
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:24,908
...that a dangerous liaison
has sprung up between your daughter...

427
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:27,118
...and the Chevalier Danceny.

428
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:31,080
Oh, no, that's completely absurd.

429
00:37:31,372 --> 00:37:35,043
Cécile is still a child.
She understands nothing of these things.

430
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:39,422
And Danceny is an entirely
respectable young man.

431
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:41,508
Tell me...

432
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:44,552
...does Cécile have a great
many correspondents?

433
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,012
Why do you ask?

434
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:48,598
I went to her room
at the beginning of this week.

435
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:50,934
I simply knocked on the door and entered.

436
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:52,435
She was stuffing an envelope...

437
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,438
...into the top right-hand drawer
of her bureau...

438
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:57,398
...in which I couldn't help noticing...

439
00:37:57,482 --> 00:38:00,652
...there seemed to be a large number
of similar letters.

440
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:07,158
I am most grateful to you.

441
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:14,165
Would you think it impertinent
if I were to make another suggestion?

442
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:16,000
No, no.

443
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:17,919
If my recollection is correct...

444
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:20,672
...I overheard you saying
to the Vicomte de Valmont...

445
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:24,259
...that his aunt invited you and Cécile
to stay at her château.

446
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:26,094
She has, yes, repeatedly.

447
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:34,769
A spell in the country
might be the very thing.

448
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:42,443
Thank you.

449
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:54,122
You asked for hindrances.

450
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:57,625
You are a genuinely wicked woman.

451
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,211
And you wanted a chance
to make my cousin suffer.

452
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,421
I can't resist you.

453
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,964
I made it easy for you.

454
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:06,634
But, all this is most inconvenient.

455
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:11,889
The Comtesse de Beaulieu
has invited me to stay.

456
00:39:12,056 --> 00:39:14,559
Well, you will just have to put her off.

457
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:18,521
Well, the Comtesse has promised me
extensive use of her gardens.

458
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:22,859
It seems her husband's fingers are
not as green as they once were.

459
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:24,444
Maybe not.

460
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:27,739
But from what I hear,
all his friends are gardeners.

461
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:29,407
Is that so?

462
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:32,118
You want your revenge, I want my revenge.

463
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,620
I'm afraid there's only
one place you can go.

464
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,080
Back to Auntie?

465
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:38,166
Back to Auntie.

466
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:41,085
Where you can also pursue
that other matter.

467
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:44,839
You have some evidence to procure,
have you not?

468
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,847
Don't you think it would
be a generous gesture...

469
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,933
...to show the proper confidence
in my abilities...

470
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:58,895
...if we were to take
that evidence for granted?

471
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:02,106
I need it in writing, Vicomte.

472
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:07,904
- Now you must leave me.
- Must I? Why?

473
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:10,490
- Because I'm hungry.
- Yes?

474
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,700
I have quite an appetite myself.

475
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:16,454
Then go home and eat.

476
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,627
In writing.

477
00:41:57,221 --> 00:42:01,434
You'll be pleased to hear,
my dear that Armand is on his feet again...

478
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,311
...and back at work.

479
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,526
Who?

480
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:13,738
Monsieur Armand!

481
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,449
Whose family you helped so generously.

482
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,285
Oh, yes!

483
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:24,206
When my nephew was last here
we discovered, quite by chance...

484
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,333
...that he had gone into the village-

485
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:28,294
Are you feeling all right, Madame?

486
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:30,337
I'm sorry to interrupt, Aunt.

487
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:31,839
It seemed to me, all of a sudden...

488
00:42:31,922 --> 00:42:34,216
...that Madame de Tourvel
didn't look at all well.

489
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:36,427
- No, I'm quite all right.
- Perhaps you need some fresh air.

490
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:38,137
Do you feel constricted in any way?

491
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:40,806
I feel sure Madame de Volanges is right,
as usual.

492
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:42,266
A turn around the grounds, perhaps.

493
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:46,896
Yes, a little walk in the garden.
It's not too cool, I think.

494
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:49,523
Fresh air will do you the world of good.

495
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:51,984
That meal was somewhat heavy, perhaps.

496
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:54,695
I can't believe that was the cause.

497
00:42:56,864 --> 00:42:58,240
Come back for it.

498
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:13,631
Mademoiselle!

499
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:17,259
I've no wish to arouse suspicion,
so I'll be brief.

500
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:19,887
The letter is from the Chevalier Danceny.

501
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:23,057
- Yes, I thought-
- Now, the handing over of such letters...

502
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,976
...is a far from easy matter to accomplish.

503
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,356
I cannot be expected to create
a diversion every day.

504
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,690
So...

505
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,069
This key resembles your bedroom key.

506
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:37,404
I happen to know it is kept
in your mother's room...

507
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,156
...on the mantelpiece,
tied with a blue ribbon.

508
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:41,742
Take it,
go up and attach the blue ribbon to it...

509
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,577
...and put it in the place
of your bedroom key.

510
00:43:43,661 --> 00:43:47,122
Bring it to me and I will get
a copy cut within two hours.

511
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:50,125
Then I can collect your letters
and deliver Danceny's...

512
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:52,461
...without any complications.

513
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:55,506
Now, in the cupboard by your bed...

514
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:57,842
...you'll find a feather
and a small bottle of oil...

515
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:01,595
...so that you may oil the lock
and hinges on the ante-room door.

516
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:04,056
Are you sure, Monsieur?

517
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:05,599
Trust me.

518
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:11,021
Believe me, Mademoiselle...

519
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,276
...if there's one thing I can't abide,
it's deceitfulness.

520
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:43,137
I trust you are feeling a little better,
Madame.

521
00:44:52,354 --> 00:44:56,817
If I were ill, Monsieur, it would not be
difficult to guess who was responsible.

522
00:44:59,903 --> 00:45:02,114
You can't mean me, do you?

523
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:04,575
- You promised to leave here.
- And I did.

524
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,286
Would you excuse me, Madame?

525
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:26,847
Quick, your mother.

526
00:45:38,442 --> 00:45:39,985
What are you doing?

527
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:43,697
I just came in to fetch your shawl.

528
00:46:35,874 --> 00:46:37,751
Why are you so angry with me?

529
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:41,380
All I can offer you is my friendship.
Can't you accept it?

530
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:44,550
I could pretend to,
but that would be dishonest.

531
00:46:44,675 --> 00:46:48,178
The man I used to be would have been
content with friendship...

532
00:46:48,804 --> 00:46:52,057
...and then set about trying
to turn it to his advantage.

533
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,851
But I have changed now.

534
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:59,273
I can't conceal from you that
I love you tenderly, passionately...

535
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:02,067
...and above all, respectfully.

536
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,906
So how am I to demote myself
to the tepid position of friend?

537
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,118
Not that you are even
pretending to show friendship.

538
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,621
- What do you mean?
- Well, is this friendly?

539
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:20,586
Why must you deliberately
destroy my peace of mind?

540
00:47:27,718 --> 00:47:30,554
You were wrong to feel threatened by me,
Madame.

541
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:34,725
Your happiness is far more
important to me than my own.

542
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:37,978
That is what I mean
when I say that I love you.

543
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,190
I think we should end this conversation.

544
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:45,319
I shall leave you in
possession of the field.

545
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,074
But look...

546
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:55,037
We are to be living under the same roof,
at least for a few days.

547
00:47:55,162 --> 00:47:57,998
Surely we don't have to try
to avoid each other?

548
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,834
Of course not.

549
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:04,004
Provided you adhere
to my few simple rules.

550
00:48:04,254 --> 00:48:07,591
I shall obey you in this as in everything.

551
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:16,683
Monsieur...

552
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:20,520
What?

553
00:48:21,897 --> 00:48:23,148
Nothing.

554
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:39,349
Nothing to worry about.

555
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:42,060
Have you brought a letter?

556
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,061
No.

557
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:45,355
Then what...?

558
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:55,657
What are you going to tell your mother?

559
00:49:55,782 --> 00:49:58,869
How will you explain the fact
that I have your key?

560
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,538
If I tell her I'm here at your invitation...

561
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,457
...I have a feeling she will believe me.

562
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:10,422
What do you want?

563
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,132
Well, I don't know...

564
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:16,344
What do you think?

565
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:17,304
No!

566
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:18,597
All right.

567
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:22,225
I just want you to give me a kiss.

568
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,897
- A kiss?
- That's all.

569
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:31,109
- Then will you go?
- Then I'll go.

570
00:50:31,192 --> 00:50:33,403
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

571
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,300
All right?

572
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:58,053
Very nice.

573
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:00,305
No, I mean, will you go now?

574
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:02,349
Oh, I don't think so.

575
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:05,018
But you promised.

576
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:07,479
I promised to go when you gave me a kiss.

577
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:10,273
You didn't give me a kiss.
I gave you a kiss.

578
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,317
Not the same thing at all.

579
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:15,445
And if I give you a kiss...?

580
00:51:15,528 --> 00:51:19,366
Let's just get ourselves more comfortable,
shall we?

581
00:51:49,354 --> 00:51:51,689
I had better go and see what's wrong,
if you will excuse me.

582
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:53,608
Of course, my dear.

583
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,984
I shouldn't worry, Madame.

584
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,780
The young have such miraculous
powers of recuperation.

585
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:02,700
I'm sure she will soon
be back in the saddle.

586
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:40,655
Who else can I turn to in
my desperation,  Madame?

587
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:44,367
And how can I write
the necessary words?

588
00:53:11,644 --> 00:53:14,439
There's something going on,
and Cécile will not tell me.

589
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,733
You must speak to her at once.

590
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:18,902
Tell me...

591
00:53:19,193 --> 00:53:21,154
...you resisted him, did you?

592
00:53:21,738 --> 00:53:23,239
Of course I did...

593
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:25,533
...as much as I could.

594
00:53:25,825 --> 00:53:27,911
- But he forced you?
- No...

595
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:31,122
...not exactly.

596
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:35,543
But I found it almost
impossible to defend myself.

597
00:53:35,627 --> 00:53:37,795
Why was that? Did he tie you up?

598
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:43,509
No, he just has a way of putting things.

599
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:46,512
You can't think of an answer.

600
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:48,514
Not even "no"?

601
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,018
I kept on saying no all the time.

602
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:57,523
But somehow,
that was not what I was doing.

603
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:03,363
I am so ashamed.

604
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:12,163
You'll find the shame is like the pain.

605
00:54:14,832 --> 00:54:17,168
You only feel it once.

606
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:27,220
You really want my advice?

607
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:36,979
Please.

608
00:54:39,232 --> 00:54:41,275
Allow Monsieur de Valmont...

609
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,153
...to continue your instruction.

610
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:49,409
Convince your mother
you've forgotten Danceny.

611
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:52,036
And raise no objection to the marriage.

612
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,955
With Monsieur de Bastide?

613
00:54:54,288 --> 00:54:57,625
When it comes to marriage,
one man is as good as the next.

614
00:54:57,709 --> 00:55:01,254
And even the least accommodating
is less trouble than a mother.

615
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:05,466
Are you saying, I'm going to have to do...

616
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,718
...that, with three different men?

617
00:55:07,885 --> 00:55:10,388
I am saying, you stupid little girl...

618
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,349
...that provided you take
a few elementary precautions...

619
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,268
...you can do it, or not...

620
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:17,061
...with as many men as you like...

621
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:18,396
...as often as you like...

622
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:21,023
...in as many different ways as you like.

623
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:26,612
Our sex has few enough advantages,
so make the best of those you have.

624
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,659
Now, here comes your
maman...

625
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:35,496
...so remember what I've said,
and above all, no snivelling.

626
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:46,007
How are you feeling now, my dear?

627
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,050
Much better, thank you,
maman.

628
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:51,053
I think you look tired.
I think you should go to bed.

629
00:55:51,137 --> 00:55:51,888
No, I-

630
00:55:51,971 --> 00:55:53,723
I think you should do
as your mother suggests.

631
00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:56,601
We can arrange to have
something brought to your room.

632
00:55:56,684 --> 00:55:58,686
I'm sure it will do you good.

633
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:02,148
Well, perhaps you are right, Madame.

634
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:09,113
You have such a very good
influence on her.

635
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:36,098
I don't think I have congratulated you
on your revenge.

636
00:56:36,182 --> 00:56:38,184
- So, you know.
- Oh, yes.

637
00:56:38,684 --> 00:56:42,688
And I believe from now
you will find her door unbolted.

638
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:54,408
Where is she?

639
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:56,494
I can't see her at the moment.

640
00:56:59,538 --> 00:57:03,709
Surely I have explained to you before
how much I enjoy watching the battle...

641
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,294
...between love and virtue.

642
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,089
What concerns me is that
you seem to enjoy watching it...

643
00:57:08,172 --> 00:57:10,758
...much more than you used
to enjoy winning it.

644
00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:12,218
All in good time.

645
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,013
The century is drawing to its close.

646
00:57:19,684 --> 00:57:21,477
Isn't it a pity that our agreement...

647
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,855
...does not relate to the task you set me...

648
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:28,359
...rather than the task I set myself?

649
00:57:28,693 --> 00:57:30,569
I am grateful, of course.

650
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:34,240
But that would have been
almost insultingly simple.

651
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:38,577
One does not applaud the tenor
for clearing his throat.

652
00:59:58,759 --> 01:00:01,553
As with every other science,
the first thing you must learn...

653
01:00:01,637 --> 01:00:03,681
...is to call everything by its proper name.

654
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:06,183
I don't see why we have to talk at all.

655
01:00:06,308 --> 01:00:08,310
Without the correct polite vocabulary...

656
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:10,771
...how would you indicate
what you would like me to do...

657
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:13,732
...or make an offer of something
I might find agreeable.

658
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:14,817
Surely you just-

659
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,027
You see, if I do my work adequately...

660
01:00:17,111 --> 01:00:18,946
...I would like to think that
you will be able to...

661
01:00:19,029 --> 01:00:22,074
...surprise Monsieur de Bastide
on his wedding night.

662
01:00:22,408 --> 01:00:24,451
- Would he be pleased?
- Of course.

663
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:28,914
He'll merely assume your  maman
has done her duty and fully briefed you.

664
01:00:29,081 --> 01:00:32,209
Maman couldn't possibly
talk of anything of that sort.

665
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:33,794
I can't think why.

666
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,673
She was, after all, one of the most
notorious young women in Paris.

667
01:00:38,173 --> 01:00:39,633
-  Maman?
- Certainly.

668
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,678
More noted for her enthusiasm
than her ability...

669
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,888
...if I remember rightly.

670
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:48,559
There was a famous occasion
before you were born...

671
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:50,477
This would have been...

672
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:59,445
...when your mother went to stay
with the Comtesse de Beaulieu...

673
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:02,322
...who tactfully gave her a room
between your father's...

674
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:03,782
...and that of a Monsieur de Vressac...

675
01:01:03,866 --> 01:01:06,577
...who was her acknowledged
lover at the time.

676
01:01:06,744 --> 01:01:09,788
Yet,
in spite of these careful arrangements...

677
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,250
...she contrived to spend
the night with a third party.

678
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:15,669
I can't believe that.

679
01:01:15,753 --> 01:01:17,838
No, no, I assure you, it's true.

680
01:01:18,797 --> 01:01:20,299
How do you know?

681
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:23,135
The third party was myself.

682
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:40,944
You asked me if Monsieur de Bastide
would be pleased with your abilities.

683
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:42,696
And the answer is...

684
01:01:43,697 --> 01:01:46,325
...education is never a waste.

685
01:01:53,665 --> 01:01:54,666
Now...

686
01:01:56,418 --> 01:01:58,378
...I think we might begin...

687
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:01,798
...with one or two Latin terms.

688
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:40,462
We go for a walk together
almost every day.

689
01:02:40,879 --> 01:02:43,465
A little further every
time down the path...

690
01:02:43,548 --> 01:02:45,259
... that has no turning.

691
01:02:46,551 --> 01:02:48,345
She has accepted my love...

692
01:02:48,428 --> 01:02:50,597
... I have accepted her friendship.

693
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,811
We are both aware of how little
there is to choose between them.

694
01:02:55,894 --> 01:02:58,355
I wish you knew me well enough
to recognize...

695
01:02:58,438 --> 01:03:00,524
...how much you have changed me.

696
01:03:00,899 --> 01:03:04,194
My friends in Paris remarked on it at once.

697
01:03:04,987 --> 01:03:07,656
I have become the soul of consideration...

698
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:10,200
...conscientious, charitable...

699
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,161
...more celibate than a monk.

700
01:03:13,245 --> 01:03:14,288
More celibate?

701
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:17,666
Well,
you know the stories one hears in Paris.

702
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:22,212
I feel she is inches from surrender.

703
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:24,756
Her eyes are closing.

704
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:41,898
Madame.

705
01:03:44,276 --> 01:03:46,194
Where are you going, Monsieur?

706
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:48,613
- To the salon.
- There is no one there.

707
01:03:48,739 --> 01:03:51,366
The others have all decided
on an early night.

708
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,536
- I very much missed our walk today.
- Yes.

709
01:03:57,330 --> 01:04:01,668
I fear with the weather as it is, we can
look forward to very few more of them.

710
01:04:01,752 --> 01:04:05,964
- This heavy rain is surely exceptional.
- Yes. May I?

711
01:04:08,258 --> 01:04:10,218
Of course.

712
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:19,728
But, you see, within a week
I shall have concluded my business.

713
01:04:24,608 --> 01:04:26,318
- I see.
- Even so, I am not sure...

714
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:28,528
...I will be able to bring myself to leave.

715
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:29,654
Oh, please. You must.

716
01:04:29,738 --> 01:04:31,531
Are you still so anxious to be rid of me?

717
01:04:31,615 --> 01:04:33,533
You know the answer to that.

718
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:39,080
I rely on your integrity and generosity.

719
01:04:39,915 --> 01:04:41,208
I want to able to be grateful to you.

720
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,543
Forgive me if I say
I do not want your gratitude.

721
01:04:43,627 --> 01:04:46,630
What I want from you
is something altogether deeper.

722
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:52,928
I know God is punishing me for my pride.
I was so certain this could never happen.

723
01:04:53,011 --> 01:04:54,679
Nothing like what? Do you mean love?

724
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:56,640
- Is love what you mean?
- You promised not to speak of it.

725
01:04:56,723 --> 01:04:58,642
Yes, of course, I understand,
but I must know.

726
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:00,936
I can't, don't you understand?
It's impossible.

727
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:04,439
You don't have to speak. Just look at me.

728
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,329
Yes...

729
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:48,858
For God's sake, you must leave
me if you don't want to kill me.

730
01:05:49,568 --> 01:05:51,278
You must help...

731
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,990
Fetch Madame,
Madame de Tourvel has been taken ill.

732
01:07:39,385 --> 01:07:41,387
I heard something as I was passing.

733
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:44,140
She seemed to be having
difficulty breathing.

734
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:47,227
- Oh, my dear, whatever is it?
- I am all right now.

735
01:07:48,061 --> 01:07:51,105
I shall leave her
in your capable hands, Aunt.

736
01:07:51,272 --> 01:07:53,316
We must send for a doctor, my dear.

737
01:07:53,399 --> 01:07:56,402
No, no, please.
I don't need a doctor. I just...

738
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:01,491
Sit with me for a moment.

739
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:44,033
I must leave this house.

740
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:47,996
I am most desperately in love.

741
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:52,584
To leave is the last thing in the world
I want to do, but...

742
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:55,378
...I'd rather die than
to live with the guilt.

743
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:59,132
My dear girl,
none of this is any surprise to me.

744
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:04,679
The only thing that might surprise
one is how little the world changes.

745
01:09:04,846 --> 01:09:07,265
What should I do? What is your advice?

746
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,892
If I remember rightly in such matters...

747
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:12,770
...all advice is useless.

748
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:16,024
I have never been so unhappy.

749
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:18,276
I'm sorry to say this but...

750
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:23,323
...those who are most worthy of love
are never made happy by it.

751
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,992
But why? Why should that be?

752
01:09:26,492 --> 01:09:30,413
Do you still think men
love the way we do?

753
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:32,290
No...

754
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,126
...men enjoy the happiness they feel.

755
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:40,089
We can only enjoy the happiness we give.

756
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:45,303
They are not capable...

757
01:09:45,553 --> 01:09:49,223
...of devoting themselves
exclusively to one person.

758
01:09:50,475 --> 01:09:53,811
So to hope to be made happy by love...

759
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:57,690
...is a certain cause of grief.

760
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:02,320
I am devoted to my nephew.

761
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:04,739
But what is true of most men...

762
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:07,784
...is doubly so of him.

763
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:10,578
And yet...

764
01:10:11,329 --> 01:10:13,956
...he could have, just now...

765
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:18,336
...he took pity on me.

766
01:10:19,504 --> 01:10:22,256
If he has released you...

767
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:26,219
...my dear child, you must go.

768
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,462
Get up, sir, quick.

769
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:38,548
Sir!

770
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:44,929
Over here.

771
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:49,684
What is it?

772
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:52,228
- Madame de Tourvel.
- What?

773
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:58,359
I want you to follow her, right now.
Stay close to her.

774
01:10:58,693 --> 01:11:00,570
I want to know everything.

775
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:05,658
Where she goes. Who she sees.
What she eats. If she sleeps.

776
01:11:05,992 --> 01:11:07,160
Everything.

777
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:15,126
That's for bribes. Yours will come later.

778
01:11:15,209 --> 01:11:16,711
- Yes, sir.
- Now, go.

779
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:17,837
Go!

780
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:33,394
Dear Father Anselme...

781
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:35,605
... try as I may, I cannot see...

782
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:38,441
... the necessity for the interview
you suggest.

783
01:11:38,774 --> 01:11:41,694
However, since you insist...

784
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:43,487
... I propose you bring him to see me...

785
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:46,782
... on Thursday, the
28th at six o'clock p. m.

786
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:56,250
This is excellent.
Make sure Father Anselme receives it.

787
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:58,711
What news?

788
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:01,297
No visitors.

789
01:12:01,547 --> 01:12:04,842
There still has not been
a single visitor since she got back.

790
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:07,511
A bite of soup last night,
didn't touch the pheasant.

791
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:09,347
Afterwards, a cup of tea.

792
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:11,349
Nothing else to report.

793
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:14,101
Oh yes, sir, there is.

794
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,729
You wanted to know
what she was reading.

795
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:20,232
The book by her bed is
"Christian Thoughts...

796
01:12:21,317 --> 01:12:22,693
"... Volume Two. "

797
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,742
How is Julie?

798
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:34,080
She seems a bit keener than
she was in the country.

799
01:12:34,163 --> 01:12:35,665
And yourself?

800
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,751
Talk about devotion to duty.

801
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:41,379
Off you go.

802
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:43,673
Keep it up.

803
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:47,468
- Madame...
- Vicomte...

804
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:53,683
Well...

805
01:12:56,852 --> 01:12:59,188
...what a pleasant surprise.

806
01:13:02,525 --> 01:13:03,693
Danceny...

807
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,153
Thank you, Monsieur, for everything.

808
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:09,657
Well, I was afraid I had been
a sad disappointment to you.

809
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:11,534
On the contrary.

810
01:13:12,201 --> 01:13:14,578
It is you I have to thank
for keeping our love alive.

811
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:17,206
Well, as to love, Cécile
thinks of little else.

812
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:19,792
She and her mother are coming
back to Paris in two weeks...

813
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,711
...and she is longing to see you.

814
01:13:21,794 --> 01:13:24,255
I have had the most
wonderful letter from her.

815
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:24,755
Really?

816
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:28,092
Not like any of her other letters,
somehow...

817
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:33,055
...quite a different tone of voice.

818
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:36,892
My dearest...

819
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:39,061
...Danceny...

820
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:42,940
...I swear to you...

821
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:44,900
...on my chastity...

822
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:50,531
...that even if my mother forces me
to go through with this marriage...

823
01:13:51,449 --> 01:13:54,410
...I shall be yours completely.

824
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:58,873
Your friend, the Vicomte de Valmont...

825
01:13:59,373 --> 01:14:02,001
... has been very active on your behalf.

826
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:04,587
I doubt if you could do more yourself.

827
01:14:06,672 --> 01:14:10,509
I don't know how I could bear to go
another two weeks without seeing her.

828
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:14,597
We shall have to do our very best
to provide some distraction for you.

829
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:16,849
If you would be so kind
as to wait in the carriage.

830
01:14:16,932 --> 01:14:20,394
There's a matter I must discuss
with the Vicomte in private.

831
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:22,480
Of course.

832
01:14:22,855 --> 01:14:25,232
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

833
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:27,318
Don't give it another thought.

834
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,947
It's been delightful.

835
01:14:37,161 --> 01:14:39,121
Poor boy, he's quite harmless.

836
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:42,708
Sometimes, Vicomte,
I can't help, but adore you.

837
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:46,378
I have a piece of news I hope
you might find entertaining.

838
01:14:46,879 --> 01:14:50,758
I have reason to believe
the next head of the house of Bastide...

839
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:52,384
...may be a Valmont.

840
01:14:52,468 --> 01:14:54,053
What can you mean?

841
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,597
Cécile is two weeks late.

842
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,851
Aren't you pleased?

843
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:02,186
I'm not sure.

844
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:05,022
Your aim was to revenge yourself
on Bastide.

845
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:08,734
I have provided him with a wife trained
by me to perform, quite naturally...

846
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:12,071
...services one would hesitate
to request from a professional...

847
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:14,698
...and very likely pregnant as well.

848
01:15:16,075 --> 01:15:17,743
What more do you want?

849
01:15:18,285 --> 01:15:22,289
All right, Vicomte, I agree.
You have more than done your duty.

850
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:26,335
Shame you let the other ones
slip through your fingers.

851
01:15:29,588 --> 01:15:31,048
I let her go.

852
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,383
But why?

853
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:34,051
I was moved.

854
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:36,637
Oh, well then, no wonder you bungled it.

855
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,014
I have an appointment
to visit her on Thursday...

856
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:41,475
...and this time I shall be merciless.

857
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,310
I am pleased to hear it.

858
01:15:48,565 --> 01:15:50,651
Why do you suppose we...

859
01:15:50,776 --> 01:15:53,904
...only feel compelled to chase
the ones who run away?

860
01:15:54,446 --> 01:15:55,781
Immaturity?

861
01:15:55,864 --> 01:15:58,534
I shan't have a moment's peace
until its over.

862
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:02,538
I love her, I hate her...

863
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,332
...my life is a misery.

864
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:12,798
Well, I think I may have kept
our young friend waiting long enough.

865
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:15,759
I shall call on you
sometime soon after Thursday.

866
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:17,344
Only if you succeed, Vicomte.

867
01:16:17,428 --> 01:16:20,264
I am not sure I can face
another catalogue of incompetence.

868
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:21,724
I shall succeed.

869
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:23,016
I hope so.

870
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,103
Once upon a time you were
a man to be reckoned with.

871
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:27,873
I understand that Father Anselme...

872
01:17:27,956 --> 01:17:30,250
...has explained to you
the reason for my visit?

873
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:32,586
Yes, he said you wished
to be reconciled with me...

874
01:17:32,669 --> 01:17:35,172
...before beginning instruction with him.

875
01:17:35,339 --> 01:17:36,715
That is correct.

876
01:17:37,758 --> 01:17:41,678
But I see no need for formal reconciliation,
Monsieur.

877
01:17:41,803 --> 01:17:42,387
No.

878
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,765
When I have, as you said, insulted you...

879
01:17:44,848 --> 01:17:48,352
...and when you have treated me
with an unqualified contempt.

880
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,021
Contempt?

881
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:54,191
You ran away from my aunt's house
in the middle of the night.

882
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:57,110
You refuse to answer
or even receive my letters.

883
01:17:57,277 --> 01:17:59,655
And all this,
after I have shown a restraint...

884
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:01,949
...of which I think we are both aware.

885
01:18:02,032 --> 01:18:04,701
I would call that,
at the very least, contempt.

886
01:18:04,785 --> 01:18:07,663
I am sure you understand me better
than you pretend to, Monsieur.

887
01:18:07,746 --> 01:18:10,123
It was me you ran away from, wasn't it?

888
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,626
I had to leave.

889
01:18:12,709 --> 01:18:15,087
And do you have to keep away from me?

890
01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:25,973
I am as unhappy as you could
ever have wanted me to be.

891
01:18:27,182 --> 01:18:29,601
I have only ever wanted your happiness.

892
01:18:30,102 --> 01:18:32,479
How can I be happy without you?

893
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,232
I must have you, or die.

894
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:47,536
Death it is.

895
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:54,918
I'm sorry, Madame.

896
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:58,088
All I wanted from this meeting
was your forgiveness...

897
01:18:58,171 --> 01:19:00,924
...for the wrongs that you think
that I have done you.

898
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:03,844
So that I may end my days
in some peace of mind.

899
01:19:04,094 --> 01:19:08,056
I understood you approved of the choice
my duty has compelled me to make.

900
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,016
Yes.

901
01:19:09,349 --> 01:19:11,643
And your choice has determined mine.

902
01:19:11,935 --> 01:19:12,894
Which is what?

903
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,314
The only choice capable of
putting an end to my suffering.

904
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,566
What do you mean?

905
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:19,109
I love you.

906
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:20,694
You have no idea how much.

907
01:19:20,777 --> 01:19:23,947
Just remember I have made
far more difficult sacrifices...

908
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:26,658
...than the one I am about to make. Now...

909
01:19:30,203 --> 01:19:31,621
- ... goodbye.
- No.

910
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:33,582
You must listen to me!

911
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:34,791
No!

912
01:19:57,898 --> 01:20:01,693
Why should you be so upset
by the idea of making me happy?

913
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,240
You are right. I cannot live
either unless I make you happy.

914
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:11,036
So I promise...

915
01:20:11,828 --> 01:20:13,413
...no more refusals...

916
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:16,374
...and no more regrets.

917
01:20:32,224 --> 01:20:36,811
Success!

918
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,648
Well...

919
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:41,775
...I arrived at about six.

920
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:45,195
Yes, I think you may omit
the details of the seduction.

921
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,155
They are never very enlivening.

922
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,115
Just describe the event itself.

923
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:51,201
It was, unprecedented.

924
01:20:51,826 --> 01:20:52,744
Really?

925
01:20:52,953 --> 01:20:58,291
It had a kind of charm that
I don't think I have experienced before.

926
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:03,880
Once she'd surrendered,
she behaved with perfect candour.

927
01:21:04,464 --> 01:21:06,591
Total mutual delirium.

928
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:11,054
Which, for the first time ever with me,
outlasted the pleasure itself.

929
01:21:11,972 --> 01:21:13,515
She was astonishing.

930
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:19,771
So much so, that I ended by falling on
my knees and pledging her eternal love.

931
01:21:21,022 --> 01:21:23,024
And do you know that at that time...

932
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:26,945
...and for several hours afterwards
I actually meant it.

933
01:21:30,073 --> 01:21:31,199
I see.

934
01:21:32,784 --> 01:21:34,744
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

935
01:21:35,662 --> 01:21:36,830
Is it?

936
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:40,083
- It sounds to me perfectly commonplace.
- Oh, no...

937
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,584
...I assure you.

938
01:21:42,877 --> 01:21:45,463
But of course, the best thing about it is...

939
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:50,010
...I am now in a position
to be able to claim my reward.

940
01:21:58,101 --> 01:22:01,354
You mean to say you persuaded her
to write a letter as well...

941
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:04,024
...in the course of
this awesome encounter?

942
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:08,695
I didn't necessarily think you were
going to be a stickler for formalities.

943
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:15,035
In any case, I may have to declare
our arrangement null and void.

944
01:22:19,622 --> 01:22:21,166
What do you mean?

945
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:24,878
I am not accustomed
to be taken for granted.

946
01:22:25,003 --> 01:22:27,047
But there is no question of that.

947
01:22:27,172 --> 01:22:29,049
You are misunderstanding me.

948
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:32,469
And I have no wish to tear you away
from the arms of someone so astonishing.

949
01:22:32,594 --> 01:22:34,471
We have always been
frank with one another.

950
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:36,806
And as a matter of fact,
I have also taken a new lover...

951
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:39,059
...who at the moment,
is proving more than satisfactory.

952
01:22:39,184 --> 01:22:41,394
- Who is that?
- I am not in the mood for confidences.

953
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:43,146
Don't let me keep you.

954
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:48,610
You can't seriously imagine
I prefer her to you?

955
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:50,278
You may genuinely be unaware of this.

956
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:54,032
But I can see quite plainly
that you are in love with this woman.

957
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:55,742
No.

958
01:22:57,869 --> 01:22:59,120
Not at all.

959
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,540
Have you forgotten what it is like
to make a woman happy?

960
01:23:02,665 --> 01:23:04,292
And to be made happy yourself?

961
01:23:04,417 --> 01:23:05,293
I?

962
01:23:06,085 --> 01:23:07,295
Of course not.

963
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,631
We loved each other once, didn't we?

964
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:11,841
I think it was love.

965
01:23:13,092 --> 01:23:14,803
And you made me very happy.

966
01:23:14,886 --> 01:23:17,347
And we could again.
We just untied the knot.

967
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:19,015
It was never broken.

968
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,810
lllusions of course,
are by their nature sweet.

969
01:23:21,935 --> 01:23:25,271
I have no illusions.
I lost them on my travels.

970
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,653
Now...

971
01:23:32,403 --> 01:23:34,113
...I want to come home.

972
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:47,961
As for this present infatuation,
it won't last...

973
01:23:48,044 --> 01:23:51,297
...but for the moment,
it is beyond my control.

974
01:24:35,508 --> 01:24:39,554
My dear Vicomte, I'm obliged
to go away for a couple of weeks...

975
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,765
... but I am well aware
of our arrangement.

976
01:24:44,309 --> 01:24:49,105
On my return you and I will spend
a single night together.

977
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:54,110
We shall enjoy it enough
to regret it is to be our last.

978
01:24:54,402 --> 01:25:00,158
But then we shall remember, that regret
is an essential component of happiness.

979
01:25:01,034 --> 01:25:02,201
All this, of course...

980
01:25:02,285 --> 01:25:06,247
... providing you are able
to procure this famous letter.

981
01:25:12,295 --> 01:25:14,422
It shall be done!

982
01:25:14,964 --> 01:25:18,718
But, Paris is so tedious without you.

983
01:25:19,302 --> 01:25:22,388
And I am living like a medieval hermit.

984
01:25:29,395 --> 01:25:31,105
All right, give me a moment.

985
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:32,315
Drink up.

986
01:25:32,398 --> 01:25:33,566
What is it?

987
01:25:33,691 --> 01:25:36,611
Someone who may well
not appreciate your presence.

988
01:25:36,736 --> 01:25:40,073
- You mean a woman?
- A lady, we might even say.

989
01:25:40,865 --> 01:25:43,076
It is not the one we wrote that letter to?

990
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:45,453
- The very one.
- I enjoyed that.

991
01:25:45,578 --> 01:25:48,247
You proved a most talented desk.

992
01:25:49,707 --> 01:25:50,958
I'd like to see what she looks like.

993
01:25:51,084 --> 01:25:52,960
- Well, you can't.
- Oh...

994
01:26:00,426 --> 01:26:04,639
On second thoughts,
I don't see why you shouldn't.

995
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:14,607
Tell me,
do you have plans for this evening?

996
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:16,108
A few friends round for dinner.

997
01:26:16,192 --> 01:26:19,278
- And after dinner?
- Nothing firm.

998
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,200
Well...

999
01:26:49,976 --> 01:26:51,352
I will be there.

1000
01:27:08,953 --> 01:27:11,872
This is an unexpected pleasure.

1001
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:15,167
- I know that woman.
- Are you sure? I would be surprised.

1002
01:27:15,293 --> 01:27:17,420
She has been pointed out
to me at the opera.

1003
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:19,630
Yes, well, she is striking.

1004
01:27:20,423 --> 01:27:22,383
She is a courtesan, isn't she?

1005
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:29,181
Yes, I suppose, in a manner of speaking.

1006
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:31,684
Well I am sorry to have disturbed you.

1007
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:34,437
Of course you have not disturbed me.
I'm overjoyed to see you.

1008
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,397
You will never be received
at my house again.

1009
01:27:36,522 --> 01:27:38,482
I don't want your lies and excuses.

1010
01:27:38,608 --> 01:27:41,235
Sit down. Just hear me out.
That is all I ask.

1011
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:43,112
Then you can judge.

1012
01:27:58,336 --> 01:28:01,922
Unfortunately, I cannot unlive
the years I lived before I met you...

1013
01:28:02,006 --> 01:28:04,842
...and during those years
I had a wide acquaintance...

1014
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:09,096
...the majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or another.

1015
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,097
Now...

1016
01:28:10,181 --> 01:28:12,475
...it may surprise you
to know that Emilie...

1017
01:28:12,558 --> 01:28:16,145
...in common with many others
of her character and profession...

1018
01:28:16,312 --> 01:28:18,939
...is kind-hearted enough
to take an interest...

1019
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:21,233
...in those less fortunate than herself.

1020
01:28:21,317 --> 01:28:22,902
In short...

1021
01:28:23,152 --> 01:28:28,449
...she has the time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work.

1022
01:28:30,242 --> 01:28:33,829
Donations to hospitals, soup for the poor...

1023
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:39,251
...protection for animals...

1024
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:42,797
...anything which touches
her sentimental heart.

1025
01:28:43,839 --> 01:28:48,677
From time to time, I make a small
contribution to her purse. That's all.

1026
01:28:52,348 --> 01:28:54,100
Is that true?

1027
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:56,102
My relations with Emilie...

1028
01:28:56,185 --> 01:28:59,105
...have been, for some years now,
quite blameless.

1029
01:28:59,438 --> 01:29:04,193
I mean, she has even done a little
secretarial work for me on occasion.

1030
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,403
Why did she laugh?

1031
01:29:06,487 --> 01:29:08,155
I have no idea.

1032
01:29:09,448 --> 01:29:11,158
Does she know about me?

1033
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:14,411
No doubt she made what,
in view of my past...

1034
01:29:14,537 --> 01:29:17,873
...must be regarded as a fair assumption.

1035
01:29:23,754 --> 01:29:25,589
I want to believe you.

1036
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,842
I knew you were coming up.

1037
01:29:28,592 --> 01:29:30,177
You were announced.

1038
01:29:38,727 --> 01:29:39,979
I am sorry.

1039
01:29:49,113 --> 01:29:50,656
But no...

1040
01:29:52,783 --> 01:29:55,494
...no, it's I who must apologize.

1041
01:29:57,037 --> 01:29:59,915
It was most insensitive of me.

1042
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:09,049
I didn't think it was possible
for me to love you more.

1043
01:30:10,342 --> 01:30:12,219
But your jealousy...

1044
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:19,184
I love you so much.

1045
01:30:34,491 --> 01:30:37,703
When will you start writing to me again?

1046
01:30:50,716 --> 01:30:52,593
My dear Vicomte...

1047
01:30:52,718 --> 01:30:57,431
... I don't believe this self-denial
can be good for you.

1048
01:30:57,973 --> 01:31:02,269
I hope it does not mean you are
neglecting your little pupil.

1049
01:31:06,774 --> 01:31:08,776
But where can Danceny be?

1050
01:31:12,112 --> 01:31:15,032
I told you,
I have all my people out looking for him.

1051
01:31:15,115 --> 01:31:16,909
There is no trace of him.

1052
01:31:30,964 --> 01:31:32,591
It is only the wind.

1053
01:31:37,221 --> 01:31:38,722
Where are you?

1054
01:31:39,098 --> 01:31:41,183
There is nothing to be frightened about.

1055
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:42,976
Yes, there is.

1056
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,772
I am bleeding.

1057
01:32:52,588 --> 01:32:54,756
Your porter seems to be
under the impression...

1058
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,009
...that you're still out of town.

1059
01:32:57,843 --> 01:33:00,554
I have in fact only just returned.

1060
01:33:00,929 --> 01:33:03,390
Without attracting the attention
of your porter?

1061
01:33:03,473 --> 01:33:06,226
I think it may be time to review
your domestic arrangements.

1062
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:08,896
I am exhausted.
Naturally, I instructed the porter...

1063
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:12,441
...to inform any casual callers
that I was out.

1064
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:15,569
And you here as well...

1065
01:33:15,777 --> 01:33:18,363
...my dear, young friend.

1066
01:33:20,407 --> 01:33:24,036
The porter appears to be having
a somewhat erratic evening.

1067
01:33:26,496 --> 01:33:28,081
Yes.

1068
01:33:28,248 --> 01:33:31,001
As a matter of fact,
it is you that I am looking for.

1069
01:33:31,084 --> 01:33:32,419
Is it?

1070
01:33:33,003 --> 01:33:37,382
Mademoiselle Cécile returns to Paris
after an absence of over two months.

1071
01:33:37,549 --> 01:33:40,260
Now what do you suppose
is uppermost in her mind?

1072
01:33:40,344 --> 01:33:45,140
Answer, of course, the longed-for
reunion with her beloved Chevalier.

1073
01:33:45,223 --> 01:33:47,893
Vicomte, this is no time to make mischief.

1074
01:33:47,976 --> 01:33:50,896
Nothing could be further
from my mind, Madame.

1075
01:33:51,188 --> 01:33:52,147
Go on.

1076
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:56,568
Imagine her distress and alarm when
her loved one is nowhere to be found.

1077
01:33:57,027 --> 01:34:00,447
I have had to do more improvising
than an Italian actor.

1078
01:34:00,572 --> 01:34:02,783
How is she? Is she all right?

1079
01:34:02,908 --> 01:34:05,786
Oh, yes. Well, no, to be quite frank.

1080
01:34:06,078 --> 01:34:08,205
I'm sorry to tell you she has been ill.

1081
01:34:08,288 --> 01:34:10,374
- Ill!
- Calm yourself, my friend.

1082
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:13,794
The surgeon has declared her
well on the road to recovery.

1083
01:34:13,877 --> 01:34:17,547
But you can well imagine how
desperate I have been to find you.

1084
01:34:17,714 --> 01:34:19,383
Of course, I...

1085
01:34:19,549 --> 01:34:22,427
My God, how could I have
been away at such a time?

1086
01:34:22,552 --> 01:34:24,554
How can I ever forgive myself?

1087
01:34:27,766 --> 01:34:31,103
But look, all is well now with Cécile,
I assure you.

1088
01:34:31,186 --> 01:34:33,814
And I shan't disturb you further.

1089
01:34:35,023 --> 01:34:38,985
It is only that I have a little
something to show the Marquise.

1090
01:34:50,038 --> 01:34:52,040
Wait in my dressing room.

1091
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:55,669
- It is through there.
- I know where it is.

1092
01:35:05,053 --> 01:35:07,597
I see she writes as badly as she dresses.

1093
01:35:09,015 --> 01:35:11,852
Is it really true the little one's been ill?

1094
01:35:11,977 --> 01:35:14,312
Not so much an illness,
more a refurbishment.

1095
01:35:14,396 --> 01:35:15,480
What do you mean?

1096
01:35:15,564 --> 01:35:16,773
Miscarriage.

1097
01:35:18,233 --> 01:35:20,277
Vicomte, I am so sorry.

1098
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,446
Your son and Bastide's heir.

1099
01:35:27,659 --> 01:35:30,787
Isn't there something else
that we should be discussing?

1100
01:35:30,871 --> 01:35:33,331
I do hope you are not going
to be difficult about Danceny.

1101
01:35:33,415 --> 01:35:35,041
I know Belleroche was pretty limp...

1102
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:37,836
...but I do think you could have found
a livelier replacement...

1103
01:35:37,919 --> 01:35:39,296
...than that mawkish schoolboy.

1104
01:35:39,379 --> 01:35:42,048
Mawkish or not,
he's completely devoted to me.

1105
01:35:42,215 --> 01:35:45,594
And, I suspect,
better equipped to provide me with...

1106
01:35:45,844 --> 01:35:48,471
...happiness and pleasure than you are...

1107
01:35:48,722 --> 01:35:50,599
...in your present mood.

1108
01:35:50,807 --> 01:35:52,475
I see.

1109
01:35:55,103 --> 01:35:59,149
If I thought you would be
your old charming self...

1110
01:36:00,275 --> 01:36:03,486
...I might invite you to visit me
one evening next week.

1111
01:36:03,862 --> 01:36:04,946
Really?

1112
01:36:05,488 --> 01:36:07,490
I still love you, you see...

1113
01:36:09,367 --> 01:36:12,245
...in spite of all your faults
and my complaints.

1114
01:36:22,255 --> 01:36:25,425
Are you sure you are not going
to impose some new condition...

1115
01:36:25,508 --> 01:36:28,845
...before you agree
to honour your obligation?

1116
01:36:38,563 --> 01:36:43,068
I have a friend who became involved
with an entirely unsuitable woman.

1117
01:36:43,944 --> 01:36:46,613
Whenever any of us
pointed this out to him...

1118
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:50,784
...he invariably made the same feeble reply:

1119
01:36:51,451 --> 01:36:54,537
"It's beyond my control," he would say.

1120
01:36:54,829 --> 01:36:58,208
He was on the verge of
becoming a laughing stock.

1121
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:02,545
At which point, another friend of mine,
a woman...

1122
01:37:02,754 --> 01:37:05,423
...decided to speak to him seriously.

1123
01:37:05,924 --> 01:37:08,718
She explained to him
that his name was in danger...

1124
01:37:08,802 --> 01:37:13,139
...of being ludicrously associated
with this phrase for the rest of his life.

1125
01:37:13,264 --> 01:37:14,891
So, do you know what he did?

1126
01:37:14,974 --> 01:37:17,477
I feel sure you are about to tell me.

1127
01:37:19,396 --> 01:37:23,650
He went round to see his mistress and
bluntly announced he was leaving her.

1128
01:37:23,817 --> 01:37:26,986
Well, as you can expect,
she protested vociferously.

1129
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:29,572
But to everything she said...

1130
01:37:29,656 --> 01:37:32,075
...to every objection she made...

1131
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:34,119
...he simply replied:

1132
01:37:34,953 --> 01:37:37,914
"It's beyond my control. "

1133
01:37:43,086 --> 01:37:44,629
Good night.

1134
01:38:11,514 --> 01:38:14,267
You're only five minutes late,
but I get so frightened.

1135
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:16,018
I become convinced I'm never
going to see you again.

1136
01:38:16,102 --> 01:38:18,938
- My angel.
- Is it like that for you, too?

1137
01:38:22,567 --> 01:38:23,401
Yes.

1138
01:38:24,443 --> 01:38:27,446
At this moment, for example,
I'm quite convinced...

1139
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:29,866
...I am never going to see you again.

1140
01:38:31,075 --> 01:38:32,368
What?

1141
01:38:33,035 --> 01:38:34,620
I'm so bored, you see.

1142
01:38:35,288 --> 01:38:37,206
It's beyond my control.

1143
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:41,043
What do you mean?

1144
01:38:43,212 --> 01:38:45,381
Well, after all, it has been four months.

1145
01:38:45,464 --> 01:38:46,883
So, what I said:

1146
01:38:47,091 --> 01:38:49,677
It's beyond my control.

1147
01:38:53,764 --> 01:38:55,641
Do you mean you don't love me anymore?

1148
01:38:55,725 --> 01:38:58,936
My love had great difficulty
outlasting your virtue.

1149
01:38:59,228 --> 01:39:01,147
It's beyond my control.

1150
01:39:02,815 --> 01:39:05,151
- It is that woman, isn't it?
- You are quite right.

1151
01:39:05,234 --> 01:39:08,279
I have been deceiving you with Emilie,
among others.

1152
01:39:08,487 --> 01:39:11,490
It's beyond my control.

1153
01:39:13,618 --> 01:39:15,328
Why are you doing this?

1154
01:39:16,996 --> 01:39:19,999
There's a woman.
Not Emilie, another woman.

1155
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:22,126
A woman I adore.

1156
01:39:23,169 --> 01:39:26,213
And I am afraid she is insisting
that I give you up.

1157
01:39:29,925 --> 01:39:32,470
It's beyond my control.

1158
01:39:35,014 --> 01:39:37,475
Liar! Liar!

1159
01:39:38,142 --> 01:39:39,935
You are quite right, I am a liar.

1160
01:39:40,019 --> 01:39:44,440
And it's like your fidelity, a fact of life.
No more nor less irritating.

1161
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:47,318
- Certainly beyond my control.
- Stop it!

1162
01:39:47,443 --> 01:39:49,153
Don't keep saying that!

1163
01:39:50,863 --> 01:39:52,823
Sorry. Beyond my control.

1164
01:39:56,285 --> 01:39:58,454
Why don't you take another lover?

1165
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:03,751
Whatever you would like.

1166
01:40:04,126 --> 01:40:06,170
It's beyond my control.

1167
01:40:11,634 --> 01:40:13,511
Do you want to kill me?

1168
01:40:15,221 --> 01:40:17,390
Listen. Listen to me.

1169
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,309
You have given me great pleasure.

1170
01:40:20,476 --> 01:40:24,188
But I simply cannot bring myself
to regret leaving you.

1171
01:40:24,563 --> 01:40:26,399
It is the way of the world.

1172
01:40:26,816 --> 01:40:29,485
Quite beyond my control.

1173
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:15,489
- Tomorrow morning, early.
- Yes, my Lord.

1174
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:23,539
This is not your appointed night.

1175
01:41:24,123 --> 01:41:25,958
That story you told me, how did it end?

1176
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:27,710
I am not sure I know what you mean.

1177
01:41:27,793 --> 01:41:31,839
Once this friend of yours had taken
the advice of his lady-friend...

1178
01:41:31,922 --> 01:41:33,674
...did she take him back?

1179
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,634
Am I to understand?

1180
01:41:35,718 --> 01:41:39,889
The day after our last meeting,
I broke with Madame de Tourvel...

1181
01:41:40,014 --> 01:41:43,267
...on the grounds that it was
"beyond my control. "

1182
01:41:43,893 --> 01:41:44,810
You didn't!

1183
01:41:44,894 --> 01:41:46,353
I certainly did.

1184
01:41:47,897 --> 01:41:49,773
But how wonderful of you.

1185
01:41:50,107 --> 01:41:52,818
You kept telling me
my reputation was in danger...

1186
01:41:52,902 --> 01:41:56,697
...but I think this may well turn out
to be my most famous exploit.

1187
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,742
I believe that it sets a new standard.

1188
01:42:01,285 --> 01:42:05,247
Only one thing could possibly
bring me greater glory.

1189
01:42:05,623 --> 01:42:07,249
What is that?

1190
01:42:09,543 --> 01:42:10,878
To win her back.

1191
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:13,213
You think you could?

1192
01:42:13,797 --> 01:42:15,382
I do not see why not.

1193
01:42:16,008 --> 01:42:17,635
I'll tell you why not.

1194
01:42:19,011 --> 01:42:23,140
Because when one woman strikes at
the heart of another, she seldom misses...

1195
01:42:23,223 --> 01:42:25,559
...and the wound is invariably fatal.

1196
01:42:25,684 --> 01:42:27,603
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

1197
01:42:29,772 --> 01:42:32,900
I am also inclined to see this
as one of my greatest triumphs.

1198
01:42:32,983 --> 01:42:36,862
There is nothing a woman enjoys
so much as victory over another woman.

1199
01:42:36,945 --> 01:42:39,531
Except you see, Vicomte,
my victory wasn't over her.

1200
01:42:39,615 --> 01:42:41,367
Of course it was, what do you mean?

1201
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:42,826
It was over you.

1202
01:42:44,453 --> 01:42:46,872
You loved that woman, Vicomte.

1203
01:42:47,456 --> 01:42:49,249
What's more, you still do.

1204
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:50,834
Quite desperately.

1205
01:42:51,752 --> 01:42:53,629
If you had not been so ashamed of it...

1206
01:42:53,712 --> 01:42:56,465
...how could you have
treated her so viciously?

1207
01:42:57,508 --> 01:43:01,887
You could not bear even the vague
possibility of being laughed at.

1208
01:43:03,222 --> 01:43:06,350
And this has proved something
I have always suspected.

1209
01:43:06,934 --> 01:43:09,353
That vanity and happiness...

1210
01:43:10,562 --> 01:43:12,481
...are incompatible.

1211
01:43:13,774 --> 01:43:19,571
Whatever may or may not be the truth
of these philosophical speculations...

1212
01:43:20,406 --> 01:43:24,326
...the fact remains,
it is now your turn to make a sacrifice.

1213
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:25,285
Is that so?

1214
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:27,996
- Danceny must go.
- Where?

1215
01:43:28,539 --> 01:43:33,544
I have been more than patient with this
little whim of yours. Enough is enough.

1216
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,379
One of the reasons that I never remarried...

1217
01:43:35,462 --> 01:43:37,714
...despite a quite bewildering
range of offers...

1218
01:43:37,798 --> 01:43:41,135
...was the determination never
again to be ordered around.

1219
01:43:41,385 --> 01:43:45,764
I must therefore ask you to adopt
a less "marital" tone of voice.

1220
01:43:45,931 --> 01:43:50,352
She is ill, you know.
I have made her ill for your sake.

1221
01:43:50,686 --> 01:43:54,231
So the least you can do is
get rid of that colourless youth!

1222
01:43:56,692 --> 01:44:00,154
Haven't you had enough of
bullying women for the time being?

1223
01:44:00,529 --> 01:44:03,574
I see I shall have to
make myself very plain.

1224
01:44:03,907 --> 01:44:06,410
I have come to spend the night.

1225
01:44:06,577 --> 01:44:09,746
I shall not take at all kindly
to being turned away.

1226
01:44:10,873 --> 01:44:14,001
I am sorry.
I have made other arrangements.

1227
01:44:15,711 --> 01:44:18,130
Yes, I knew there was something.

1228
01:44:19,464 --> 01:44:20,382
What?

1229
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:28,307
Danceny isn't coming. Not tonight.

1230
01:44:28,849 --> 01:44:31,059
What do you mean. How do you know?

1231
01:44:34,479 --> 01:44:38,483
I know, because I have arranged
for him to spend the night with Cécile.

1232
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:46,283
Come to think of it,
he mentioned he was expected here.

1233
01:44:46,783 --> 01:44:50,871
But, when I put it to him that he would
really have to make a choice...

1234
01:44:50,954 --> 01:44:53,290
...I must say, he did not hesitate.

1235
01:44:53,707 --> 01:44:57,294
He is coming to see you tomorrow,
to explain.

1236
01:44:57,461 --> 01:44:59,880
And to offer you...

1237
01:44:59,963 --> 01:45:02,591
- Do I have this right? Yes, I think I do. -

1238
01:45:03,216 --> 01:45:04,968
...his eternal friendship.

1239
01:45:05,636 --> 01:45:09,306
As you said, he is entirely devoted to you.

1240
01:45:10,974 --> 01:45:12,684
That is enough, Vicomte.

1241
01:45:13,143 --> 01:45:14,978
You are absolutely right.

1242
01:45:16,813 --> 01:45:18,148
Shall we go up?

1243
01:45:19,066 --> 01:45:21,151
Shall we, what?

1244
01:45:21,401 --> 01:45:22,569
Go up.

1245
01:45:22,653 --> 01:45:26,740
Unless you prefer this,
if memory serves, rather purgatorial sofa.

1246
01:45:26,823 --> 01:45:29,743
- I think it is time you were leaving.
- No, I do not think so.

1247
01:45:29,826 --> 01:45:32,996
We made an arrangement.
I really don't think I can allow myself...

1248
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,041
...to be taken advantage of
for a moment longer.

1249
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:38,669
Remember,
I am better at this than you are.

1250
01:45:38,752 --> 01:45:41,713
Perhaps. But it is always
the best swimmers who drown.

1251
01:45:41,797 --> 01:45:43,757
Now, yes or no?

1252
01:45:44,591 --> 01:45:46,259
It is up to you, of course.

1253
01:45:46,343 --> 01:45:49,096
I will merely confine myself to remarking...

1254
01:45:49,179 --> 01:45:52,683
...that a "no" will be regarded
as a declaration of war.

1255
01:45:56,812 --> 01:45:59,940
A single word is all that is required.

1256
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,528
All right.

1257
01:46:08,824 --> 01:46:10,617
War!

1258
01:46:33,974 --> 01:46:36,393
My dear Chevalier Danceny...

1259
01:46:37,519 --> 01:46:42,190
... I understand you spent
last night with Cécile Volanges.

1260
01:46:42,691 --> 01:46:46,403
I learnt this from her
more, regular lover...

1261
01:46:47,195 --> 01:46:49,823
... the Vicomte de Valmont.

1262
01:48:06,358 --> 01:48:09,027
I am dying because
I would not believe you.

1263
01:49:56,801 --> 01:49:58,386
Fetch the surgeon.

1264
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,054
No, no.

1265
01:50:00,513 --> 01:50:01,973
Do as I say.

1266
01:50:10,356 --> 01:50:11,983
A moment of your time.

1267
01:50:16,321 --> 01:50:20,658
Two things: A word of advice,
which of course you may ignore, but...

1268
01:50:21,159 --> 01:50:23,995
...it is honestly intended...

1269
01:50:24,496 --> 01:50:26,039
...and a request...

1270
01:50:27,248 --> 01:50:28,208
Go on.

1271
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:33,004
The advice is:
Be careful of the Marquise de Merteuil.

1272
01:50:34,172 --> 01:50:36,758
You must permit me to treat
with scepticism...

1273
01:50:36,841 --> 01:50:39,093
...anything you have to say about her.

1274
01:50:39,177 --> 01:50:41,596
Nevertheless, I must tell you...

1275
01:50:42,013 --> 01:50:45,350
...in this affair, we
are both her creatures...

1276
01:50:50,688 --> 01:50:54,108
...as I believe her
letters to me will prove.

1277
01:50:57,028 --> 01:51:00,949
When you have read them,
you may decide to circulate them.

1278
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:06,704
And the request?

1279
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:11,834
I want you somehow...

1280
01:51:12,752 --> 01:51:14,003
...somehow...

1281
01:51:14,587 --> 01:51:17,757
...to get to see Madame de Tourvel.

1282
01:51:20,551 --> 01:51:22,512
I understand she is very ill.

1283
01:51:22,637 --> 01:51:25,139
That is why this is most important to me.

1284
01:51:28,142 --> 01:51:31,312
I want you to tell her
that I cannot explain...

1285
01:51:31,854 --> 01:51:34,607
...why I broke with her as I did.

1286
01:51:35,483 --> 01:51:39,737
But that since then,
my life has been worth nothing.

1287
01:51:42,156 --> 01:51:45,785
I pushed the blade in deeper
than you just have my boy...

1288
01:51:46,411 --> 01:51:49,163
...and now I need you
to help me withdraw it.

1289
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,336
Tell her it is lucky for her
that I have gone...

1290
01:51:56,295 --> 01:51:59,382
...and I am glad not to have
to live without her.

1291
01:52:01,259 --> 01:52:06,681
Tell her, her love was the only
real happiness that I have ever known.

1292
01:52:11,728 --> 01:52:13,646
Will you do that for me?

1293
01:52:14,731 --> 01:52:15,982
I will.

1294
01:52:19,986 --> 01:52:22,363
It is all very well feeling sorry now.

1295
01:52:23,197 --> 01:52:24,574
Let him be.

1296
01:52:27,326 --> 01:52:29,203
He had good cause.

1297
01:52:32,582 --> 01:52:38,379
I don't believe that's something anyone
has ever been able to say about me.

1298
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:16,584
Enough...

1299
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:22,423
Draw the curtains.

1300
01:54:21,232 --> 01:54:23,526
Get out! Get out of here!
