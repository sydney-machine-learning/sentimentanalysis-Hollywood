00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:25,274
<b>Broken Arrow</b>

2
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:31,506
<i>This is the story of a land...</i>

3
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,927
<i>...and its people in
the year 1870...</i>

4
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:36,178
<i>...and of a man...</i>

5
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,096
<i>...whose name was Cochise.</i>

6
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,431
<i>He was an Indian...</i>

7
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:42,059
<i>...leader of the Chiricahua
Apache tribe.</i>

8
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,770
<i>I was involved in the story...</i>

9
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:48,106
<i>...and what I am telling happened
exactly as you'll see it.</i>

10
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:51,818
<i>The only change will be that
when the Apaches speak...</i>

11
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:54,154
<i>...they will speak in our language.</i>

12
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:57,115
<i>What took place is part of
the history of Arizona...</i>

13
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:00,452
<i>...and it began for me here,
where you see me riding.</i>

14
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,873
<i>Since leaving the Army I had been
prospecting for gold off and...</i>

15
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,294
<i>...one day I heard the colonel
at Tucson wanted to see me.</i>

16
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:13,382
<i>The story started when I saw
buzzards circling in the sky.</i>

17
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,343
<i>The buzzard's a smart bird.</i>

18
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:17,886
<i>Something...</i>

19
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,764
<i>...or somebody,
was getting ready to die.</i>

20
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:24,518
<i>I figured it was a hurt deer
or a rabbit or a snake.</i>

21
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,024
<i>Not a rabbit...</i>

22
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:32,568
<i>...not a deer.</i>

23
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,321
<i>His kind was more dangerous
than a snake.</i>

24
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,032
<i>He was an Apache.</i>

25
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,287
<i>For ten years we'd been on a
savage war with his people...</i>

26
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:46,081
<i>...a bloody, no-give, no-take war.</i>

27
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,538
Drink.

28
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,047
Better slow.

29
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,976
I could have killed you before.

30
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,787
<i>A fire was dangerous
in Apache country.</i>

31
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:11,124
<i>But his wounds were bad and
he was running a high fever.</i>

32
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,880
<i>He had eight pieces of buckshot
in his back and I dug them out.</i>

33
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:21,510
<i>He was in pain but he never
let out a sound.</i>

34
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,888
<i>For the next few days I panned
the stream for gold...</i>

35
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,348
<i>...and watched the boy.</i>

36
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:30,477
<i>I wanted to be on the move, and
I was glad he was recovering.</i>

37
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,482
Do your legs feel stronger today?

38
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:36,400
Little bit.

39
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,660
You've still got a limp.

40
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,454
Today I must leave.

41
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,999
No, I must go. Too soon for you.

42
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,210
For my legs, yes,
but for my family, no.

43
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:56,753
This is my novice time.

44
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,381
I am 14. So I learn to be a man.

45
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:01,383
I go on trips alone.

46
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,844
But I have been away too long.

47
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,722
In the wickiup my mother is crying.

48
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,974
My father looks for me, I think.

49
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,268
I am their only one now.

50
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:14,563
My brother and my sister were
killed at Big Creek.

51
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,993
<i>"My mother is crying", he said.</i>

52
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:32,831
<i>It never struck me that an Apache
woman would cry over her son...</i>

53
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,374
<i>...like any other woman.</i>

54
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,294
<i>"Apaches are wild animals",
we all said.</i>

55
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,507
Do you pray to Killer of Enemies?

56
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,804
Not even to Life Giver?
The ones up there.

57
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,058
We have another name.

58
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,936
Apaches pray for all
white men to die.

59
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,522
But now I pray to keep you safe.

60
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,818
At sunset last night, I threw pollen
to the four winds for you.

61
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:04,029
Thanks, boy.

62
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,031
This is very big...

63
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,116
...against headache and sickness.

64
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:10,869
Now it is yours.

65
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,505
They could have killed.
Put away your gun.

66
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:28,345
My people are watching us.
They see I am unharmed.

67
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,062
This is clear talk.

68
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,147
It says they can still kill.

69
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,912
This white man is my friend.

70
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,748
This white man is my friend.

71
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,278
He must not be hurt.

72
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,780
When did my son become a tame Apache?

73
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:32,951
Father look! He gave me life again
when the soldiers wounded me.

74
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,745
Where did you meet soldiers?

75
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,830
It will shame us to say.

76
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,374
An Apache should not do what
others cannot know.

77
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,375
This one...

78
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,877
- ...he was with them?
- No.

79
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:46,215
He found me later. He healed me.
It will be wrong to harm him.

80
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,883
You do no give orders.

81
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,677
You speak our tongue?

82
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:51,970
A little.

83
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,182
White men pay many dollars
for the scalp of an Apache.

84
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,225
I know.

85
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,101
Then why did you not take his scalp?

86
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:01,855
If I kill an Apache it'll not
be for scalp or money.

87
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,775
Why not? My people and your
people are at war.

88
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,276
It is not my way to fight.

89
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,654
- It is the way of all whites.
- It is not my way.

90
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,864
You are a woman maybe.

91
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,870
Apaches do not take scalps either.
And they are not women.

92
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:18,830
He hides something.

93
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,208
Why are you here in our mountains?

94
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,001
I look for gold and silver.

95
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,169
For what?

96
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,338
For yellow iron.

97
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,634
You did not kill.

98
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,595
We will not kill this time.

99
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,597
But not again.

100
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,516
Give him his gun.

101
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:50,821
<i>They wanted to kill me, all right,
but they let me go.</i>

102
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,532
<i>I learned things that day.</i>

103
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:56,451
<i>Apache mothers cried
about their sons.</i>

104
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,580
<i>Apache men had a sense
of fair play.</i>

105
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,834
Ambush! Run!

106
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,446
<i>Two men were killed, and for
the three wounded it was worse.</i>

107
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,326
<i>But this was war, and it was
cruelty in both sides.</i>

108
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,999
<i>On one of the men
they found a pouch...</i>

109
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,418
<i>...which held three Apache scalps.</i>

110
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:14,798
<i>So they dug a pit and they rubbed
his face with sweet juice...</i>

111
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,759
<i>...and made me watch the ants come.</i>

112
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,056
Learn it...

113
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:26,977
...learn it well, this is Apache land.
You have no right here.

114
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,938
Where Cochise lives,
no white man can live.

115
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,107
Take your weapons. Go!

116
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,859
Let your face not be seen again!

117
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,557
Howdy, gents.

118
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,392
Hi, Tom.

119
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,312
- Find yourself a gold mine?
- No.

120
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,147
Howdy, Terry.

121
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,732
Just coffee for me.

122
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,401
- We have smoked turkey today.
- No, just coffee, thanks.

123
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,490
Wipe them all out...

124
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,408
...but cheer them.

125
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,577
- Jeffords?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,496
I'm Colonel Bernall.

127
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,581
You received my message?

128
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,583
That's why I came.
What's on you mind?

129
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,377
I'm the new chief at Fort Grand.

130
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,378
Congratulations.

131
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,131
My orders are to clean out
Cochise and his Apaches.

132
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,300
A big order, sir.

133
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,054
Wipe them all out.
Butcher them like hogs, I say...

134
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,806
...like hogs.

135
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,559
This man was in a party of miners...

136
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,312
...ambushed yesterday by Apaches.

137
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,481
Where was the ambush?

138
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,607
Just south of here.

139
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,861
They wounded Cochise
and killed 12 Apaches out of 50.

140
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:03,740
There weren't 50 only 5,
and not a one scratched.

141
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,534
How do you know, Jeffords?

142
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,618
I watched it.

143
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,039
Watched it? Seems to me most
men would have lent a hand.

144
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,126
I was tied.
The Apaches got me earlier.

145
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,044
You fought your way out?

146
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,671
They let me go.

147
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,175
I never heard of a thing like that
happening to a white man.

148
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,344
- Did you, John?
- No.

149
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,098
- Did you, Milt?
- No.

150
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,604
I ran across a
wounded Chiricahua boy.

151
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,940
I healed him up. They thought
they owed me something.

152
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,610
- Apaches playing fair?
- Yes.

153
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,153
I don't understand.

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,989
You mean you found a wounded
Apache and didn't kill him?

155
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,407
That's right.

156
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,327
I'd like to ask you why?

157
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,136
What do you want from me, Colonel?

158
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:07,930
Jeffords...

159
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,432
...I think I know how
we can stop Cochise.

160
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,894
I have 250 men from Pennsylvania
and New Jersey.

161
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:15,520
They're disciplined troopers.

162
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,981
- Yes, I've seen them around.
- I have a good plan.

163
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,151
I want information from you and
I want you to do reconnoitering.

164
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,404
In six months the war will be over
and we'll have Cochise hanging.

165
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,031
No, you won't, Colonel.

166
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,534
Jeffords, I'm an expert
on open warfare.

167
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,911
- I have thirty...
- Cochise can't read a map...

168
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,041
...but he knows every gulley,
every mountain in Arizona.

169
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,506
His men and horses can go
twice as far as yours.

170
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,175
He can't write his name...

171
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,553
...but his intelligence
service knows when...

172
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,597
...you got to Fort Grant and
how many men you've got.

173
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,433
He's stopped the
Butterfield stage from running...

174
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,144
...he's stopped the U.S. mails
from going through.

175
00:14:56,311 --> 00:15:01,900
For the first time he has all
the Apaches under one command.

176
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,403
You're not going to string
him up in six months.

177
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,238
Not in six years.

178
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,865
Good day, gents.

179
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,034
- Terry.
- Jeffords!

180
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,412
Will you scout for me?

181
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,831
- You can find somebody else.
- Maybe...

182
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,084
...Captain Jeffords became too
friendly with the Apaches.

183
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,795
Maybe he doesn't know
what side he's on.

184
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,547
Easy, gents.

185
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,967
I'm not looking for trouble but
if you don't fight them...

186
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:29,094
...you're with them.
I've got to say that.

187
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
Who says so? What's your name?

188
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,849
Ben Slade. I own a ranch only
a mile out from Fort Grant.

189
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,894
The Apaches burned my
house last month.

190
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,146
My wife was inside.

191
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,356
They almost got my boy too.

192
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,192
A white man should hate that.

193
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,485
Right. Anybody would.

194
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,738
Why don't you join
the Colonel's staff?

195
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,908
- That's private business, Slade.
- War ain't private business...

196
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,659
...when they kill women and kids.

197
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,912
At Big Creek we killed
Indian women and kids.

198
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,663
Cochise started this and any...

199
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,999
Hold on! Let's just get
the facts straight here.

200
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,876
Cochise didn't start this war.

201
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:04,087
A snooty little lieutenant
fresh out of the east started it.

202
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,632
He flew a flag of truce which
Cochise honored...

203
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,675
...then he hanged his brother and...

204
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,010
...others under the flag.

205
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,762
You hear all sorts of stories.

206
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,348
You want to know why I didn't
kill that Apache boy?

207
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:17,893
For the same reason I wouldn't kill
your boy or scout for the army.

208
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,937
I'm sick and tired of
all this killing.

209
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,105
And, who asked us
out here in first place?

210
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,774
I don't know, Tom.

211
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,484
I don't say we do right.

212
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,444
But we're bringing civilization here.

213
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,614
Clothes, carpets, hats,
boots, medicine.

214
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,783
Why I got a wagonload of whiskey...

215
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,201
...waiting in the east?

216
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,246
I could sell that
if it wasn't for Cochise.

217
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:38,372
It's an ambush!

218
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,915
Run!

219
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,926
Juan, come on in.

220
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,641
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi, Milt.

221
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,310
After all this time,
one single freight wagon...

222
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,812
...squeezed through.

223
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,730
Cochise didn't show his ugly face.

224
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,441
Are you sending your mail riders
with the military?

225
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,527
It'd take the Army and Navy.

226
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,572
No eastern mail has gone out
or come in for seven weeks.

227
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,074
The Apaches are shooting
my job right from under me.

228
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,703
Maybe there's a way to
get your mail through.

229
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,871
A new route?

230
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,124
Could I use this office
every afternoon for a while?

231
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,293
- What for?
- Juan.

232
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,670
Juan, I've got work for you.

233
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,172
I want to hire you for
maybe almost a moon.

234
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,633
I want you to teach me
to speak Apache good.

235
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,677
I want to learn about Apache spirits.

236
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,180
I want to learn about the Apache ways.
Apache in here.

237
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,683
No white man asks to learn
these things. Why do you?

238
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,435
I want to speak to Cochise.

239
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:42,811
Are you crazy, Tom?

240
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,480
Milt, I'm sick and tired
of being in the middle.

241
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,025
I'm tired of people like Lowrie,
Terry, and you...

242
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,359
...asking my position.

243
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,862
I've been willing to go
into Cochise's territory...

244
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,615
...to look for gold.
I've risked before.

245
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,617
Cochise will not speak
with white men.

246
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,243
We'll send up smoke signals.

247
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,536
He will not come to see you.

248
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,705
No, I want to go and see him.

249
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,707
- To his stronghold?
- That's right.

250
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
No white man's seen
Cochise in ten years...

251
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,046
- ...and lived to tell it.
- Once you could talk to him.

252
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,505
Don't try it, Tom.

253
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,257
The ants will eat your eyes.

254
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,051
That could happen any time.

255
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,844
Like the other day.

256
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,846
Juan, will you teach me?

257
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,599
I want to tell Cochise to
let the mail go through.

258
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,892
Maybe even about peace.

259
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:23,393
Yes...

260
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,605
...I will teach you, and for this
I will not take any dollars.

261
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,025
But I think it will end bad.
I think Cochise will kill you.

262
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,571
Milt, can we use the office?

263
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,199
It's your eyes.

264
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,630
Good enough. Apache eyes quick.

265
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,632
This says you come in peace.

266
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,718
They will doubt it but it'll
make them want to find out.

267
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,596
You've speak our language well.

268
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,182
You do not yet think
like an Apache...

269
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,809
...but you are close to.

270
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,852
Juan, you've been a good guide.

271
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,938
If I see Cochise...

272
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,566
...what grows from our talks
will be from you too.

273
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,442
Last night I heard an owl...

274
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,069
...the worst of all signs.

275
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,697
It is not yet too late.
Come back with me.

276
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,448
They will kill you.

277
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,660
I didn't hear the owl, Juan,
but thank you anyway.

278
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,794
Remember then:

279
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,170
...If you see him...

280
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,505
...do not lie to him.

281
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,215
Not in the smallest thing.

282
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,384
His eyes will see into your heart.

283
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,595
He is greater than other men.

284
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,379
<i>I started into the canyons that
led into Cochise's country.</i>

285
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,260
<i>I never felt so lonely and
frightened in my life.</i>

286
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>For three days I climbed
higher towards...</i>

287
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,058
<i>...the Apache stronghold.</i>

288
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,426
<i>On the third day...</i>

289
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,012
<i>...I was nearing the entrance
to the stronghold.</i>

290
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,222
<i>Juan had told me what to look for.</i>

291
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,184
<i>Cochise had given me
permission to enter.</i>

292
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,396
<i>I kept my hands visible...</i>

293
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,148
<i>...away from my weapons...</i>

294
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,276
<i>...and I tried to look at ease.</i>

295
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,350
It is known that the chief
of Chiricahua Apaches...

296
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,269
...is the greatest Indian leader.

297
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,148
I have come to speak to him about
the welfare of his people.

298
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,734
It is known he respects truth...

299
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,652
...as he respects bravery.

300
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,293
You will hold these for me?

301
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,380
I will want them when I leave.

302
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,762
How do you know you will
leave here alive?

303
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,728
I am Cochise.

304
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,396
Speak.

305
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,486
When the Indian wishes to
signal his brother...

306
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,696
...he does so by smoke signs.

307
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,534
This is the white man's signal.

308
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,413
My brothers far away can look at
this and understand my meaning.

309
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,415
We call this mail.

310
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,710
The men who carry the
mail are like the air...

311
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,296
...that carries the
Apache smoke signals.

312
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,924
They seek no trouble.

313
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,176
Yet your warriors kill them.

314
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,180
I've come here ask you to let
these men travel in safety.

315
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,935
This mail carries war
signals against us.

316
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,188
No, this is used for other talk.

317
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,524
War signals are sent
by the military...

318
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,234
...by special ways.

319
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,694
How?

320
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,114
Sometimes by a thing
we call the telegraph.

321
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,616
Other times by men like me.

322
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,453
You have carried messages against us?

323
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,831
When I was a scout for
the military, yes.

324
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,625
You have fought us?

325
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,918
Yes.

326
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,259
In the battle of Apache Pass.

327
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,138
Come with me.

328
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,254
You are a brave man.

329
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,640
Now hear me.

330
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,893
I am the leader of my people.

331
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,230
They do not betray me and
I do not betray them.

332
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,776
We fight for out land against
Americans who try to take it.

333
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:56,573
You give me no reason why I should
not kill American mail riders...

334
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,992
...and kill you too.

335
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,079
You were not asked to come here.

336
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,207
Mail riders do you no harm.

337
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,211
Apaches who did your people
no harm were hanged.

338
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,128
One was my brother.

339
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,256
My people have done
yours great wrong.

340
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,508
I have always said this.

341
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,052
Do you think because I am
an Indian I am a fool?

342
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,178
You can trick me?

343
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,597
I would not have come here
if I thought that.

344
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,432
A fool sees only today.

345
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,019
Because I respect you and
your people, I think of tomorrow.

346
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,939
What about tomorrow?

347
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,942
The Apaches are warriors
without equal.

348
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,653
But they are small in number...

349
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,363
...and tomorrow they'll be smaller.

350
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,409
I will not talk of that with you.

351
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,745
Is it not possible that your
people and mine...

352
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,956
...can some day live together
like brothers?

353
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,836
That is strange talk
from a white man.

354
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,923
Your people do not want peace.
They have taught me that.

355
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,468
This mail can be the first step.
I ask you to think on it.

356
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,972
Why should not the
white man act first?

357
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,765
Am I better than the white man?

358
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,767
A white man has come here.

359
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,562
I ask you to think of your people...

360
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,898
...and look at tomorrow.

361
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,568
My mind must work on it.

362
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,453
You will rest here tonight.

363
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,246
It is my strong wish.

364
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,208
Walk with me so they will
see us together...

365
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,044
...so you will be safe here.

366
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,099
What is the meaning of the dance?

367
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,560
The Spirits of Good and
Evil are dancing.

368
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,061
Not everyone can do it.

369
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,397
If it's done wrong they
will be angry up there.

370
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:38,485
This must be the dance preceding
the sunrise ceremony for a girl.

371
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,487
You know about it?

372
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,738
A little bit.

373
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,575
Without words it tells me things.

374
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,037
You are very different from
other whites, Tall One.

375
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,957
You learn to speak our tongue...

376
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,794
...try to understand our ways.

377
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,673
It is good to understand
the ways of others.

378
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,303
I respect your people, Cochise.

379
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,097
You know what I am thinking?

380
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,726
Maybe some day you will
kill me or I will kill you...

381
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,270
...but we will not spit
on each other.

382
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,690
That is how I feel.

383
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,030
The girl inside the wickiup is in
the holiest time of her live.

384
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,909
These four days she becomes
White Painted Lady, Mother of Life.

385
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,536
It is good luck to visit her now.

386
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,039
- Would you like to visit her?
- Yes.

387
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,041
Were you ever wounded?

388
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,500
In my arm.

389
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,960
We will tell her.

390
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,464
For this night only this girl is
more holy than most, maybe...

391
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,133
...because she has been away
from us for a long time.

392
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,844
She is very old for this ceremony.

393
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,596
It's very special.

394
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,524
White Painted Lady...

395
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,277
...I have old wounds.

396
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,075
Yes...

397
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,870
...but each scar is a mark
of love for your people.

398
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,541
The path of you people is
stretched long behind you...

399
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,126
...and you are the head...

400
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,711
...and you are the heart...

401
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,547
...and you are the blood.

402
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,926
Killer of Enemies is your
father and you are his son.

403
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,679
You will be well.

404
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,893
I have brought someone with me.

405
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,146
Then he is welcome.

406
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,691
He has an old arm wound.

407
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,418
Give me your arm.

408
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,091
Does it hurt you?

409
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:08,844
Sometimes.

410
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,430
It will never hurt again.

411
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,141
Your life will be long.

412
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,685
The good things will be yours.

413
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,813
The sun will shine for you.

414
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,544
What's her name?

415
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,213
Sonseeahray.

416
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,340
It means Morning Star.

417
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,759
Morning Star.

418
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,712
This is called shaving.

419
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,008
You...

420
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,262
...see white men have more hair on
their faces than Indians, so...

421
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,098
...they cut it of instead
of pulling the hairs out.

422
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,601
Maybe you'd like to come closer.

423
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,774
Don't be afraid, Sonseeahray.

424
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,197
See?

425
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,366
I'm not afraid.

426
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,119
I thought you were skinning yourself.

427
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,370
No.

428
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,372
- Does it hurt?
- No.

429
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,041
How did you know I was there?

430
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,418
I saw you through this.

431
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,757
This is much better than looking
in a pool of water.

432
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,721
And now I see you.

433
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,599
What a thing it is.

434
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:19,933
It's yours to keep.

435
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,979
Well...

436
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,482
...if you had it you could
see how beautiful you are.

437
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,863
Why do you leave? Stay, please.

438
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,700
It is not fitting. I...

439
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,869
...I should have run
away quick before.

440
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,078
Why?

441
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,497
I am not married.

442
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,501
Are you not allowed to
talk to Apache men?

443
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,420
Old men.

444
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,130
Never young men?

445
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,674
Only at ceremonies or in the dancing.

446
00:34:56,637 --> 00:35:00,390
I thought that Apache boys and girls
pick those they wanted.

447
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,352
Well, how can they do that
if they do not meet?

448
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,229
They meet.

449
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,440
- There are ways.
- What ways?

450
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,944
They meet by accident
where no one sees them.

451
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,280
Like my mother could
see me here with you.

452
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,909
I understand.

453
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,497
Now I must go. I have work
to pick juniper berries.

454
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,623
Where?

455
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,169
There.

456
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,713
I was going to walk up
that way myself...

457
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,757
...by accident.

458
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,764
Sonseeahray.

459
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,316
I walk this way because I don't
know when I may see you again.

460
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,985
When do you go?

461
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,863
I don't know. Cochise said
he would talk to me soon.

462
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,074
- Will you come back?
- I hope so.

463
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,452
I want to. It's important to me.

464
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,663
Why?

465
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,915
May I speak truly...

466
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,334
...from my heart?

467
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,254
It will be all right.

468
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,635
All my life I've been mostly alone.
I wanted it that way...

469
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,682
...but when I saw you in the wickiup
and you touched me...

470
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,310
...and you prayed for me...

471
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,979
...I felt bad being alone...

472
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,733
...and I knew that I needed to
see you again before I left...

473
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:36,778
...so that I could find out if
it was the same as last night.

474
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,783
Is it the same?

475
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,785
Yes.

476
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,371
So now when I go away...

477
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,792
...I'll be lonely for someone for
the first time in my life.

478
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,777
I have decided about the mail.

479
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,864
If I let the riders go in safety,
but no one else...

480
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,075
...there will be no loss.

481
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,537
It will show the whites
what power the Apache has.

482
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,539
It makes me laugh.

483
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,583
A good step. The seed is small...

484
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,252
...maybe the tree will grow big.

485
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,087
I'll be happy to tell my people.

486
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,553
Is it straight, Captain?
You saw Cochise himself?

487
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,804
That's right.

488
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,515
Any lad who would go into
Cochise's camp alone...

489
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:47,933
...is some punkin of a man.

490
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,768
Or a blasted liar!

491
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,396
I believe Captain Jefford's word...

492
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,107
...but not the word of
and Apache murderer.

493
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,694
Cochise said the mail
would ride safe. I believe him.

494
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,779
While you were up there with him...

495
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:04,408
...his men attacked a wagon train
near here and killed every one.

496
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,412
Another band attacked Kliner's ranch
and killed three men and a boy.

497
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,626
Cochise never said anything
about calling off the war.

498
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:16,670
He said the mail was safe.

499
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,632
Are you willing to bet on
the word of an Indian?

500
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:21,967
You name it.

501
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,595
Will you lay three hundred dollars...

502
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,806
...that five riders in succession
leave here and five come back.

503
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,351
You've got a bet.

504
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,272
The mail's piled up...

505
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:39,610
...and the route's guaranteed safe
by Tom Jeffords and Cochise.

506
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,322
Three days of riding in
the sunshine at high pay.

507
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,449
Who's first?

508
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,165
Looks like you'll have to
go yourself, Jeffords.

509
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,292
Only that won't prove a thing.

510
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,961
I'll go.

511
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,797
That'll prove something.

512
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,954
Duffield's back!

513
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,413
It's Duffield.

514
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,623
He's back.

515
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:40,128
Good boy!

516
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,393
See any Apaches?

517
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,354
Saw a few some signals but
not one live Indian.

518
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,397
Hi, Milt.

519
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,691
- It's all right, Tom.
- Why'd you take so long?

520
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:06,488
When I got there safe I got drunk.
Took time to sober up.

521
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,742
One made it but there's
still four more.

522
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,703
My bet's safe.

523
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,246
You want to double it?

524
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,960
<i>After Duffield returned,
we sent out a second rider.</i>

525
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,171
<i>He saw some Apaches but
nothing happened.</i>

526
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,259
<i>The third rider, too, said it
was peaceful on the trail.</i>

527
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:32,389
<i>When the fourth rider went out
I was really proud of Cochise.</i>

528
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:36,476
<i>The days passed quietly and
on one of those quiet days...</i>

529
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:40,022
<i>...a wagon train left
Messilla Park for Tucson.</i>

530
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,316
<i>Colonel Bernall was in charge.</i>

531
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,527
Spectacular country, isn't, General?

532
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:49,865
I wouldn't presume to tell and
Indian fighter his business...

533
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,409
...but we're inviting an ambush.

534
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,369
Apaches could be hiding over there.

535
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,206
I'm not only inviting ambush,
I'm praying for it.

536
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,540
Why?

537
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,417
You've only got 75 men.

538
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,419
My mule drivers are armed...

539
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,631
...and I've got 50 riflemen hiding
under blankets in the wagons.

540
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,799
My eyes are getting old.

541
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,187
Nahilzay!

542
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:33,867
Halt!

543
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,121
Pistol attack!

544
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,849
No mister, no!

545
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,521
Goklia! Cut them off!

546
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,589
They're cutting off the cavalry!

547
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,230
Halt!

548
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,709
Nahilzay! Pionsenay!

549
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:06,877
The foot soldiers!

550
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:44,540
Seize the wagons!

551
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:35,859
Cut to pieces...

552
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:39,571
...fifty dead and a hundred wounded.
Colonel Bernall killed...

553
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,867
...five thousand pounds of grain,
every wagon, gun, and mule.

554
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:47,162
How did Cochise know we had
men hidden in the wagons?

555
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:52,125
He knows what goes on everywhere.

556
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,962
Who's the spy? I say, hang him.

557
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,838
I can tell you.

558
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,215
We all can.

559
00:45:58,382 --> 00:45:59,258
Who?

560
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,176
Duffield in here?

561
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:02,302
Yeah.

562
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:03,637
What do you want?

563
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:07,015
Your last mail rider's just
come in, safe and sound.

564
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:10,852
Thanks.

565
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:11,979
Yeah...

566
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,605
...where's Lowrie?

567
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:16,149
You lost your bet, Lowrie.

568
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,110
It don't pay to bet
with Tom Jeffords.

569
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,196
He's a personal friend of
that murderer, Cochise.

570
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:23,574
It was all a plot.

571
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:34,877
How was it fixed?

572
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:37,337
- I got both hands on the bar.
- How was it fixed?

573
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,964
I'm a rancher, not a gunner.

574
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,716
Slade. You got friends here.

575
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:41,842
You want to plug me.

576
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:44,094
Cochise don't do favors for nothing.

577
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:46,221
- He got something.
- What? What'd he get?

578
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,432
You tell us. Was it guns,
or was it whiskey?

579
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,229
Anybody else want to
call me a renegade?

580
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,023
You are not a renegade, Jeffords.

581
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,150
A man's a liar who says you are...

582
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,652
...but why is Cochise
so partial to you?

583
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,988
How does he let the
mail rider through...

584
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:05,282
...on the same day he wipes
out a wagon train?

585
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:08,118
Because he's a man of honor.

586
00:47:08,285 --> 00:47:10,621
A man of honor?
No Indian's a man of honor.

587
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,749
The first peace move in ten years
and you're blind, all of you.

588
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:17,419
We'll have peace when every
Apache is hung from a tree!

589
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,591
Here's your 300 dollars, Jeffords.

590
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,054
The drinks are on me.

591
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,473
I don't drink on any Indian lover.

592
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:34,937
He's a copperhead. He sold us out.

593
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,064
String him up!
What are we waiting for?

594
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:11,723
Release that man.

595
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,141
Release that man.

596
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,081
- I'm grateful to you, General.
- I don't want your gratitude.

597
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:39,960
I won't scout Indians for
you or anybody else.

598
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,462
- I don't want you to.
- What then?

599
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,840
I want you to take me to see Cochise.

600
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,635
If anybody can do it, you can.

601
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:51,513
I know you have reason to be angry.

602
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,599
But please hear me out.

603
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,102
You don't like
Army officers apparently.

604
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,521
Does this also prejudice
you against me?

605
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,315
That depends on how you read it.

606
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:04,776
The Bible I read preaches brotherhood.

607
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,947
Suppose their skins aren't white.
Are they still God's children?

608
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:12,034
My Bible says nothing about
the pigmentation of the skin.

609
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:18,415
There was a General
served under Grant...

610
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:19,917
...the Christian General.

611
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,669
Yes, also Bible-Reading-Howard.

612
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,423
Why do you want to see Cochise?

613
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,508
To make a peace treaty with him.

614
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:29,927
Who sent you here?

615
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,303
The President of the U.S.

616
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,097
- With what power?
- Full power to make a fair treaty.

617
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,308
To be changed later.

618
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:40,145
My treaty will stand.
I have the President's word.

619
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,774
I'll do nothing, General,
to betray Cochise.

620
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:46,527
Why all this change of
heart in Washington?

621
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,530
President Grant is eager for a
fair peace with the Apaches.

622
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,616
- What is a fair peace?
- Suppose you tell me.

623
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:54,493
Equality.

624
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,496
The Apaches are a free people.
They have a right to stay free...

625
00:49:57,621 --> 00:49:59,831
- ...on their own land.
- The whole southwest?

626
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,083
No.

627
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,294
No, even Cochise wouldn't ask
for that now. He's a realist.

628
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:06,755
But a clear territory
that's Apache...

629
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:08,757
...ruled by Apaches
that's what I mean.

630
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:10,467
No soldiers on it.

631
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:12,511
Yes, I'll agree to that. What else?

632
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,763
You can talk the rest
over the Cochise.

633
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,599
- You'll take me to him alone?
- Without soldiers?

634
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:19,810
- Is that the best way?
- That's the only way.

635
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:20,853
I'll go alone.

636
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,522
I'll see Cochise.
I'll get in touch with you.

637
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,818
Read your Bible for me too.

638
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:30,529
I like the way you read it.

639
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,926
Welcome.

640
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:56,471
Your signals were seen and they
have been told to Cochise.

641
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,432
He is in the other stronghold.

642
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,601
He asks you to wait
and be comfortable.

643
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,102
He will return.

644
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:06,315
I will wait.

645
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:13,280
My feet are tired from trying
to find you by accident.

646
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:14,448
Waiting for you, I...

647
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:17,784
...I have washed my hair twice
and my clothes three times.

648
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,501
How is this soap made?

649
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:29,421
It comes from yucca root.
We grind it up.

650
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:41,516
Sonseeahray...

651
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,812
...there's something I need to know.

652
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:48,899
I've been away almost a moon.

653
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:50,901
Has anything changed with you?

654
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:52,486
No.

655
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,905
When you went away I...

656
00:51:55,072 --> 00:51:56,448
...I became frightened.

657
00:51:57,074 --> 00:51:58,200
I thought...

658
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,118
...he won't come back...

659
00:52:00,536 --> 00:52:03,664
...and if he does, when he returns
from his own people...

660
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:07,167
...he will look at me with cool eyes.

661
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,170
But then I...

662
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,548
...I stopped being afraid...

663
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:14,466
...in here.

664
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,304
You're trembling.
You're not frightened of me?

665
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:20,847
No.

666
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:23,475
Only you put such new
feelings in my heart.

667
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:26,895
I am trembling inside too.
Should I hide it?

668
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:29,898
No.

669
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:45,205
Tom!

670
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:20,157
Here they come and
he rides before them.

671
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,406
It will be told at our campfires...

672
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:03,158
...how the Chiracahuas fought.

673
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,160
How the great Cochise led us.

674
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:09,331
A great wagon train destroyed.

675
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,543
Their wagons and horses taken.
Corn for the whole winter...

676
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:13,794
...blankets, guns!

677
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:17,589
In a battle there are losses.

678
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:22,511
Some of our men have gone to
live with their fathers.

679
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:24,763
They were brave.

680
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,640
They died honorably.

681
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:31,061
Now for the last time,
listen to their names.

682
00:54:31,228 --> 00:54:33,981
They will be angry if their names
are ever mentioned again.

683
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,651
Ponce.

684
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:39,820
Victorio.

685
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:42,698
Pionsenay and his son Machogee.

686
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:46,785
Naratena.

687
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:48,912
Big Chee.

688
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:54,334
No, thank you.

689
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:56,503
If I make a peace with
this General...

690
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,963
...can other bigger break it?

691
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,549
No, he speaks for the Chief.
There's no one bigger.

692
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:04,219
- Can I trust them?
- Will they trust you?

693
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,471
My word is my life.
I do not break it.

694
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:08,599
I know that. They do not.

695
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:10,893
There can be no peace
without good will.

696
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,144
Try it.

697
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:15,189
All Americans are not
like that lieutenant.

698
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:19,526
You trust me, Cochise.
There are Americans that I trust.

699
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,321
There are Indians that
I would not trust.

700
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:26,575
Me too.

701
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:33,373
After eating, wipe the
hands on the arms.

702
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,958
The grease is good for them.

703
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,127
Among white men we wash it off.

704
00:55:37,294 --> 00:55:38,712
What a waste.

705
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,445
My friend, all evening your eyes
have gone to that same maiden.

706
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,155
You must understand...

707
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:09,201
...any man may be friendly with a
woman whose husband is dead...

708
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:13,080
...but not with a maiden
like Sonseeahray.

709
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,127
Cochise, I...

710
00:56:19,336 --> 00:56:21,463
This girl has been asked for already.

711
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:23,882
I think she will be married soon.

712
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:54,037
You have been chosen.

713
00:56:54,288 --> 00:56:55,789
It will be an insult not to go.

714
00:57:32,367 --> 00:57:34,286
We should not be seen together, Tom.

715
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:39,333
If that is true, why did you
choose me to dance with?

716
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,376
I could not help it.

717
00:57:42,878 --> 00:57:44,213
With me it's the same.

718
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:46,048
I'll speak to your parents tonight.

719
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:48,217
No, Tom. It will cause deep trouble.

720
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:50,886
- You must not.
- It causes trouble already.

721
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:53,680
You have not acted like my brother.

722
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:57,518
I told you that she is a maiden,
and yet you came here.

723
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,561
I want her for my wife.

724
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:03,190
I will do all the things expected
of a husband here.

725
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:07,402
I refused Nahilzay once.
I will again.

726
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:13,367
I am glad it is the right way...

727
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:17,412
...but it will not be easy for you.

728
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:19,998
You are an American.

729
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,626
Where will you live? Here?

730
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:27,339
Apaches who have suffered from
white men will hate you.

731
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:29,383
Tucson, maybe?

732
00:58:30,592 --> 00:58:34,513
Won't the whites hate your wife for
of the color of her skin?

733
00:58:36,348 --> 00:58:38,267
You will go far away maybe...

734
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:40,185
...in new places...

735
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:43,188
...but your eyes will see nothing.

736
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:46,316
Always they will be
turned backwards...

737
00:58:47,276 --> 00:58:48,652
...toward home.

738
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,865
And you, Sonseeahray...

739
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:57,035
...they will look at you as
at a strange animal...

740
00:58:58,245 --> 00:58:59,371
...and make jokes.

741
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:03,292
Hear me, Tall One...

742
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:05,586
...I ask you to think on it.

743
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:08,338
Your way will be filled
with bitterness.

744
00:59:09,256 --> 00:59:10,424
Think...

745
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:13,260
...is it not better to
live with your own?

746
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:18,098
Though you are my friend, Cochise,
nothing can change it.

747
00:59:19,558 --> 00:59:21,310
I will marry Sonseeahray.

748
00:59:22,269 --> 00:59:24,188
What he says does not have to be.

749
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:26,106
You are young. You do not know.

750
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:29,526
With him I do not tremble...

751
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,320
...even before you.

752
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:36,992
I cannot say more against it.

753
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:39,786
But it won't be easy.

754
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,915
Her parents. You will need
a strong go-between.

755
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:44,708
Will you be my go-between?

756
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,293
No other can do it.

757
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:50,672
I will speak for you tonight,
otherwise it will be worse.

758
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:54,301
Already everyone knows of this.

759
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,180
Your secret was as quiet
as the thunder.

760
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:02,643
Also I will speak to Nahilzay.

761
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:07,314
He has bad luck. It has happened
before to other men.

762
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,568
You wait in your wickiup maybe.

763
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:14,154
Walk up and down.

764
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,241
It is good for people in love.

765
01:00:34,424 --> 01:00:35,717
Well?

766
01:00:40,097 --> 01:00:41,765
You have no luck with women.

767
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:43,058
They refused.

768
01:00:45,894 --> 01:00:48,230
I'll take her away from here!
She'll go with me too.

769
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,066
They did not refuse.

770
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:54,027
I make a joke.
It is always a good joke.

771
01:00:54,611 --> 01:00:57,531
It is all arranged. Three horses
and saddles to the parents.

772
01:00:58,031 --> 01:00:59,616
I'll get them in Tucson.

773
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:02,202
No. You will let me
give them for you.

774
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,288
- No.
- No, I want to.

775
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:07,457
They're almost yours anyway.

776
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,043
They come from your people.

777
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,255
I want to do this for you.

778
01:01:13,422 --> 01:01:15,757
You marry next full moon.

779
01:01:15,924 --> 01:01:17,092
Why the delay?

780
01:01:17,593 --> 01:01:19,720
Her mother decided. It is her right.

781
01:01:21,555 --> 01:01:22,806
Listen now.

782
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:24,516
Go to Tucson.

783
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:26,435
Look into the heart of this general.

784
01:01:26,602 --> 01:01:28,395
Bring him back if you believe him.

785
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:33,233
I will send out runners, Apaches
from all tribes will come here.

786
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:36,778
To talk of peace is a big thing.
I cannot decide it alone.

787
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:39,364
My people may not want it.

788
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:44,494
I make no promises.

789
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:46,079
That is not expected.

790
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:48,582
Good sleep, my brother.

791
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:50,459
Remember, no promises.

792
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:49,309
I heard noise.

793
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:57,693
It is not your knife.
It is an Apache knife.

794
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:19,131
To attack someone who has been
given safety here is forbidden.

795
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,342
It is a terrible wrong.
It cannot be allowed.

796
01:03:28,515 --> 01:03:30,100
Nothing's changed.

797
01:03:30,267 --> 01:03:31,393
Go to Tucson.

798
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,895
Return in ten days.

799
01:03:35,397 --> 01:03:38,650
I ask you to forgive me that one
of my people broke my word.

800
01:03:48,577 --> 01:03:49,953
Nahilzay.

801
01:03:52,456 --> 01:03:54,583
In battle I have had no one like you.

802
01:03:55,959 --> 01:03:57,711
Our lives were often mixed.

803
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:02,758
It is ended. You have
betrayed our people.

804
01:04:22,402 --> 01:04:26,615
<i>I went back to Tucson and
studied General Howard.</i>

805
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:32,162
<i>Before our return I learned to
respect the Christian General.</i>

806
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:36,708
<i>I prayed that a decent peace
would come from this.</i>

807
01:04:37,084 --> 01:04:38,835
<i>I wanted it for my country...</i>

808
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:41,463
<i>...for Cochise and his people...</i>

809
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,258
<i>...and I wanted it because
I loved a girl.</i>

810
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,262
I am told it is permitted to visit.

811
01:04:48,887 --> 01:04:50,681
For a short time only.

812
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:55,227
My mother is inside the wickiup.
You will sit there...

813
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:03,443
...and I will keep sitting here...

814
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:06,154
...for we must not even
touch our hands.

815
01:05:08,407 --> 01:05:09,658
During the days I...

816
01:05:09,825 --> 01:05:13,620
...I am very busy now. I prepare
my clothes for the wedding.

817
01:05:14,496 --> 01:05:18,000
I must build a special wickiup
for our honeymoon...

818
01:05:18,876 --> 01:05:20,419
...away from everybody.

819
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,422
Our honeymoon, Tom!

820
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:29,136
I must also build the wickiup
we will live in.

821
01:05:29,595 --> 01:05:32,598
In all this my mother
helps me and teaches me...

822
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:35,267
...and I try to do as I...

823
01:05:35,434 --> 01:05:37,853
...I think she did when
she was a girl.

824
01:05:39,354 --> 01:05:41,106
And she couldn't have done it neater.

825
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:44,067
What is that? What does it mean?

826
01:05:44,568 --> 01:05:46,528
That's something Americans say.

827
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:51,783
It means that I love you and
I'll honor your parents.

828
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:03,170
You understand, Cochise,
about the signing of this map.

829
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,380
I will place my name upon yours...

830
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:07,382
...you will place
your mark upon mine.

831
01:06:07,674 --> 01:06:09,092
What is this signing?

832
01:06:09,218 --> 01:06:12,971
This is proof for all people of
any agreement that is made.

833
01:06:13,222 --> 01:06:15,182
It is as we agreed yesterday.

834
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:17,351
You will explain it to the others.

835
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:23,690
<i>The peace conference had been
going on for four days...</i>

836
01:06:23,857 --> 01:06:27,402
<i>...and we were asked to approach
the meeting place.</i>

837
01:06:28,195 --> 01:06:32,407
<i>We finally met the most important
men of the Apache tribes.</i>

838
01:06:33,116 --> 01:06:35,577
<i>They had come from Arizona
and New Mexico...</i>

839
01:06:36,328 --> 01:06:39,498
<i>...they would decide with Cochise
whether there would be peace.</i>

840
01:06:46,922 --> 01:06:49,049
My white brother
will tell you something.

841
01:06:51,677 --> 01:06:53,929
I have in my hand here a map.

842
01:06:54,263 --> 01:06:56,306
This is a sort of picture writing.

843
01:06:56,723 --> 01:07:00,143
It shows the Apache territory,
fifty thousand square miles...

844
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,770
...that you have agreed upon.

845
01:07:01,937 --> 01:07:04,314
This map will go back
to Washington...

846
01:07:04,523 --> 01:07:07,025
...were the Chief of all
the white men lives.

847
01:07:07,693 --> 01:07:09,987
If you make a treaty of peace...

848
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:12,531
...this will be part of that treaty.

849
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:18,036
If we make peace with
the Americans...

850
01:07:18,203 --> 01:07:19,746
...can we still raid the Mexicans?

851
01:07:20,163 --> 01:07:22,374
There cannot be war against
the Mexicans either.

852
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,167
Let the white eyes...

853
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:26,545
Wait. We will talk of
this by ourselves.

854
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,714
Now is the time only for questions.

855
01:07:29,298 --> 01:07:32,342
If the chief of the white men
dies, what will follow?

856
01:07:33,093 --> 01:07:35,929
His word is a bond on
the chief who follows him.

857
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:39,725
Do others wish to speak?

858
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:41,894
I have a question.

859
01:07:42,853 --> 01:07:47,316
Suppose some white man wants
yellow iron and he comes into our land.

860
01:07:47,649 --> 01:07:48,734
Can we kill him?

861
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:51,445
He should be captured and
given to our military.

862
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:53,655
Then he will be judged and punished.

863
01:07:54,948 --> 01:07:58,702
What if he resists capture until
he has killed one of my men?

864
01:07:59,244 --> 01:08:03,290
If a white man kills an Indian on
your territory we will hung him.

865
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:07,169
That will be something
for Cochise to see.

866
01:08:11,632 --> 01:08:13,008
Who else?

867
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:19,014
You will go now.
I will bring you our decision.

868
01:08:28,565 --> 01:08:30,067
I trust none of it.

869
01:08:30,234 --> 01:08:33,111
Four days ago we were given
our territory on a piece of paper.

870
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:37,407
Today we cannot go into Mexico.
The American General says no.

871
01:08:37,824 --> 01:08:40,118
Already our territory is smaller.

872
01:08:40,661 --> 01:08:45,666
Where will we get horses if not by
taking them from the Mexican?

873
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:50,420
The government will give us cattle.
We will raise and trade them.

874
01:08:50,879 --> 01:08:52,631
The answer of a woman.

875
01:08:57,135 --> 01:08:59,304
I am not afraid.
I speak from my heart.

876
01:08:59,513 --> 01:09:00,722
You speak well.

877
01:09:00,889 --> 01:09:02,140
Speak more.

878
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:06,645
Apaches are not
grandmothers to cattle.

879
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:10,232
Cochise now fears battle and
is ready to surrender.

880
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:15,195
It is not this false peace
we need but a new chief.

881
01:09:25,664 --> 01:09:27,291
Now I say this.

882
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:31,461
The American keep cattle but
they are not soft or weak.

883
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:36,091
Why should not the Apache
be able to learn new ways?

884
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:39,845
It is not easy to change but
sometimes it is required.

885
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:43,473
The Americans are growing stronger...

886
01:09:44,474 --> 01:09:46,226
...while we are growing weaker.

887
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:49,938
If a big wind comes,
a tree must bend...

888
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:52,858
...or be lifted out by its roots.

889
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,753
I will make a test of
it for three moons.

890
01:10:18,133 --> 01:10:19,718
I break the arrow.

891
01:10:20,302 --> 01:10:22,095
I will try the way of peace.

892
01:10:27,142 --> 01:10:29,770
I will give my word to the
American General tonight.

893
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:33,315
Those who stay with me
must keep my word.

894
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:37,819
Let all others walk away.
They are no longer my brothers.

895
01:10:41,073 --> 01:10:43,242
If more walk away than stay...

896
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,912
...then I will no longer
be your chief.

897
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:50,123
I walk away.

898
01:10:57,339 --> 01:10:58,966
I walk away.

899
01:10:59,758 --> 01:11:01,343
I walk away.

900
01:11:02,678 --> 01:11:04,096
I walk away.

901
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,684
I walk away.

902
01:11:10,018 --> 01:11:11,520
I walk away.

903
01:11:19,862 --> 01:11:21,405
Who else comes?

904
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:24,950
Who else comes?

905
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,745
Who else?

906
01:11:38,463 --> 01:11:40,424
Take your women, your children...

907
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:42,843
...your horses, your weapons.

908
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:45,012
Leave our territory.

909
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:48,640
I leave you my name also.

910
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:51,560
Now I am ashamed to be a Chiricahua.

911
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,771
I will take the name Mexican
enemies have given me.

912
01:11:54,938 --> 01:11:56,398
The Whites will learn it...

913
01:11:56,565 --> 01:11:57,983
...and you will learn it.

914
01:11:58,442 --> 01:11:59,651
From now on...

915
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:01,403
...I am Geronimo!

916
01:12:03,947 --> 01:12:07,743
If Geronimo or his followers come
to this territory again...

917
01:12:08,952 --> 01:12:10,829
...let them come with weapons.

918
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:16,001
I am worried.
They're taking a long time...

919
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:17,377
...too long.

920
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:21,465
I am worried too.
This is delicious. What is it?

921
01:12:22,299 --> 01:12:24,468
Pony. In you honor, General.

922
01:12:25,052 --> 01:12:27,221
Pony? What kind of meat's that?

923
01:12:28,388 --> 01:12:31,099
A pony is a small horse, General.

924
01:12:47,574 --> 01:12:49,243
We will try this peace.

925
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:51,411
But there must be a waiting time...

926
01:12:51,662 --> 01:12:53,997
...a time for testing. Three moons.

927
01:12:54,164 --> 01:12:55,332
Why is it needed?

928
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:58,377
The white man has not kept
a peace in the past.

929
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:01,838
- Three month armistice.
- It's a good idea.

930
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:12,349
The first stone.

931
01:13:15,686 --> 01:13:17,896
For every day without war
there will be another.

932
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:20,983
When 3 moons have passed,
the pile will be high.

933
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:24,611
Then we will place a white flag
on it and there will be peace.

934
01:13:25,779 --> 01:13:27,614
My heart is glad, Cochise.

935
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:29,700
I am not yet glad.

936
01:13:30,576 --> 01:13:34,621
To talk a peace is not hard.
To live it is very hard.

937
01:13:36,248 --> 01:13:38,292
I will wait three moons to be glad.

938
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:43,088
<i>Not everyone was happy
about the treaty.</i>

939
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,967
<i>Some still thought Cochise
was a liar and a murderer...</i>

940
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:50,220
<i>...and peace impossible
until he was dead.</i>

941
01:13:50,387 --> 01:13:52,723
<i>But the 90 days of
the armistice began.</i>

942
01:13:53,265 --> 01:13:57,436
<i>I saw things that never
happened before.</i>

943
01:13:57,769 --> 01:13:58,812
<i>Near Fort Grant...</i>

944
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:01,190
<i>...a cavalry patrol passed
some Apaches.</i>

945
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:02,858
<i>They didn't talk...</i>

946
01:14:03,025 --> 01:14:05,319
<i>...they didn't pretend
they'd become friends.</i>

947
01:14:05,652 --> 01:14:06,945
<i>But they didn't shoot.</i>

948
01:14:12,326 --> 01:14:16,246
<i>Two days later the first coach
in five years left Tucson.</i>

949
01:14:16,997 --> 01:14:19,541
<i>I rode with it on my way
back to the Stronghold.</i>

950
01:14:24,213 --> 01:14:26,131
Where's that water
you said we came to?

951
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,467
Right down below.
That's where I'll leave you.

952
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:48,362
Time to stretch, gents.

953
01:14:56,495 --> 01:14:58,330
I can believe a fellow
can ride here...

954
01:14:58,497 --> 01:15:00,165
...with his liver not turned white.

955
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:03,919
Yeah. A fellow can even think about
settling down and getting married.

956
01:15:11,718 --> 01:15:13,679
Take cover!

957
01:15:14,179 --> 01:15:15,389
What are you shooting at?

958
01:15:15,556 --> 01:15:16,765
I saw something move.

959
01:15:16,974 --> 01:15:18,016
Save your ammunition!

960
01:15:18,183 --> 01:15:23,272
Blast you and that murdering Cochise
both. We'll be slaughtered.

961
01:15:23,438 --> 01:15:24,857
Shut up!

962
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,611
Keep down under cover, everybody!

963
01:15:29,778 --> 01:15:31,029
Now listen to me.

964
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:32,573
This isn't Cochise.

965
01:15:32,739 --> 01:15:34,366
It's a band of renegade Indians.

966
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,952
There're a few of them
or they'd be rushing us.

967
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,290
They're very badly armed too.
What they want is our guns.

968
01:15:43,584 --> 01:15:46,545
Well, we're pinned here.
They're waiting for night.

969
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:47,754
So what do we do?

970
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:49,506
Wait to be butchered in the dark?

971
01:15:49,673 --> 01:15:51,175
Shut up!

972
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:52,801
Who's a good shot?

973
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,595
I'm not bad. Here.

974
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:01,226
When I yell, you and this fellow
start firing into the hill.

975
01:16:02,144 --> 01:16:04,271
Lonergan, you cover the bank.

976
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:05,564
I'm coming upstream.

977
01:16:05,772 --> 01:16:07,399
- What do you do?
- Send smoke signals.

978
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:08,859
All right, start shooting!

979
01:16:57,658 --> 01:16:59,117
How many rounds you got left?

980
01:16:59,284 --> 01:17:00,452
Two.

981
01:17:00,619 --> 01:17:01,537
One.

982
01:17:01,703 --> 01:17:04,122
Those signal of Jeffords
did us a lot of good...

983
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,041
...a lot of good.

984
01:17:08,293 --> 01:17:09,461
Listen!

985
01:18:05,726 --> 01:18:07,769
Apaches protecting Americans!

986
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,355
I lived to see it!

987
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:13,859
Remember to talk about
it back in Tucson.

988
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:22,534
Twelve days.

989
01:18:22,743 --> 01:18:25,537
I think it goes well.
There are many good signals.

990
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:29,458
It has gone well for twelve days.
I still wait to be glad.

991
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:32,669
Now you will forget
about peace and war.

992
01:18:33,295 --> 01:18:34,838
Think only of your bride.

993
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:36,882
Is the ceremony a long one?

994
01:18:37,049 --> 01:18:38,133
No...

995
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,719
...with us the ceremony of
love takes place here.

996
01:18:41,261 --> 01:18:42,763
The rest is small.

997
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:45,349
Let the bride come here.

998
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:46,767
The time has come.

999
01:19:08,163 --> 01:19:11,250
Let the groom take his
place beside her.

1000
01:19:25,514 --> 01:19:26,640
Your left hand.

1001
01:19:30,227 --> 01:19:31,728
Your right hand.

1002
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:52,124
Kneel down upon the earth.

1003
01:19:57,713 --> 01:19:59,715
Now your blood mixes.

1004
01:20:00,048 --> 01:20:01,967
Now for you there is no rain...

1005
01:20:02,259 --> 01:20:04,469
...for one is shelter to the other.

1006
01:20:05,304 --> 01:20:07,556
Now for you there is no cold...

1007
01:20:08,056 --> 01:20:10,809
...for one is warmth to the other.

1008
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:13,729
Now there is no loneliness...

1009
01:20:14,271 --> 01:20:17,900
...now forever,
there is no loneliness.

1010
01:20:20,777 --> 01:20:25,324
There are two bodies but now
there is but one blood in both.

1011
01:20:26,241 --> 01:20:30,454
Go now. Ride the white horses
to your secret place.

1012
01:21:03,987 --> 01:21:04,905
Look.

1013
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:07,908
The evening is full and happy for us.

1014
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,869
We will listen to the brook...

1015
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:12,329
...all through the night.

1016
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:14,498
And listen to the bells.

1017
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:19,336
It's as though they are
singing in my heart.

1018
01:21:37,855 --> 01:21:39,231
Sixteen stones.

1019
01:21:45,404 --> 01:21:47,990
I know of the attack
on the stage coach.

1020
01:21:48,156 --> 01:21:49,366
It was Geronimo.

1021
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:52,286
We trailed him two days but
he crossed into Mexico.

1022
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:56,874
You did not follow?

1023
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,543
We wanted to, but we did not.

1024
01:21:59,835 --> 01:22:01,044
Good...

1025
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:05,465
...we will protect all the whites
leaving Tucson and Fort Bowie.

1026
01:22:05,924 --> 01:22:07,885
Also we will guard Apache Pass.

1027
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:12,306
Let the whites break the peace.

1028
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:14,433
It must not be Indians...

1029
01:22:15,309 --> 01:22:16,894
...not even bad Indians.

1030
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:37,247
- You are asleep?
- No.

1031
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,001
I'm quiet because I'm happy.

1032
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,171
I'm afraid if I open my mouth,
my happiness will...

1033
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,965
...will rush out in a
funny noise like...

1034
01:22:47,132 --> 01:22:48,133
...Yahoo!

1035
01:22:50,135 --> 01:22:53,138
What does that mean?
It is an American word?

1036
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:59,561
I think Adam said it when he
opened his eyes and saw Eve.

1037
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,104
Who are they?

1038
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:03,565
Don't you know?

1039
01:23:06,985 --> 01:23:09,947
The world is so big and
I know so little.

1040
01:23:16,286 --> 01:23:17,663
Sometime...

1041
01:23:18,789 --> 01:23:21,458
...will you grow tired of me
and go back to your people?

1042
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,919
That is a bad thought, Sonseeahray.

1043
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:26,338
Never think it again.

1044
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:28,257
You are my people.

1045
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:30,217
Will you tell me that often?

1046
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:33,720
Each day of our life together
I'll tell it to you.

1047
01:23:34,638 --> 01:23:37,266
I'll always remember the
moments of these days.

1048
01:23:37,933 --> 01:23:40,060
We will remember them together.

1049
01:23:41,061 --> 01:23:44,940
In the quiet of the nights
we will talk of them a little.

1050
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:50,863
We will see our children ride
white horses, maybe.

1051
01:24:31,028 --> 01:24:32,696
I can do better myself.

1052
01:24:33,197 --> 01:24:36,200
By the time he is a grown man,
he will know how.

1053
01:24:47,085 --> 01:24:48,086
What is it?

1054
01:24:48,337 --> 01:24:52,132
I found this one up the canyon.
He had this.

1055
01:24:52,382 --> 01:24:54,051
I know this boy, Cochise.

1056
01:24:54,801 --> 01:24:56,929
Hello. You're Ben Slade's boy,
aren't you?

1057
01:24:57,095 --> 01:25:01,975
Yeah, Captain Jeffords. I've been
praying you'd be up here.

1058
01:25:02,142 --> 01:25:06,021
Keep calm. No one will hurt you.
Did you lose your way?

1059
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:07,481
Not exactly.

1060
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:10,442
You're the one who said these
Apaches wanted peace.

1061
01:25:11,151 --> 01:25:13,445
It's not peaceful when they steal.

1062
01:25:14,404 --> 01:25:15,822
What got stolen?

1063
01:25:17,574 --> 01:25:19,535
Two young colts of mine. Beauties.

1064
01:25:20,202 --> 01:25:22,120
Swiped night before last by Apaches.

1065
01:25:22,746 --> 01:25:24,206
I tracked them all day...

1066
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,875
...followed their tracks
up the canyon.

1067
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:29,002
I ended up out there
at dark last night.

1068
01:25:30,379 --> 01:25:32,381
Then that redskin
jumped me in the morning.

1069
01:25:32,589 --> 01:25:35,717
None of my people took them.
The boy lies.

1070
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,970
Cochise.

1071
01:25:39,054 --> 01:25:42,516
I know this boy's father
hates the Apaches.

1072
01:25:42,683 --> 01:25:46,353
We have to show that he's wrong.

1073
01:25:46,937 --> 01:25:52,568
Maybe you have men like Geronimo
who would betray you.

1074
01:25:54,778 --> 01:25:58,365
You speak wisely.
I will see these horse signs.

1075
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,952
All right, bub.
We'll mosey down and take a look.

1076
01:26:37,529 --> 01:26:38,572
See them yet, bub?

1077
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,240
Right around here, Captain.

1078
01:26:47,664 --> 01:26:49,750
You call the boy 'bub'.
Is it his name?

1079
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:51,293
No, it's just to be friendly.

1080
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,920
Here they are, Captain.

1081
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:58,717
Don't shoot till my boy
gets out of the way.

1082
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:08,602
Cochise, they'll kill you. Run!

1083
01:27:12,856 --> 01:27:13,857
Get Cochise!

1084
01:27:23,116 --> 01:27:24,993
Run! Sonseeahray, run!

1085
01:27:34,628 --> 01:27:37,381
The big one is Cochise.
Somebody give me a gun.

1086
01:27:37,506 --> 01:27:39,424
Watch out, son,
you stay clear of this.

1087
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:04,867
Slade, stay out of line.
We can't shoot.

1088
01:28:05,033 --> 01:28:06,451
He's out of arrows!

1089
01:28:23,802 --> 01:28:25,762
He got away! It's a bust!

1090
01:28:25,929 --> 01:28:27,306
Our whole plan's a bust!

1091
01:28:27,472 --> 01:28:30,726
I'm heading for Mexico.
The military will be after us, too.

1092
01:28:31,143 --> 01:28:32,936
What are you standing there for?

1093
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,023
Come on.

1094
01:28:44,489 --> 01:28:46,074
Sonseeahray.

1095
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:56,835
Sonsee...

1096
01:29:06,094 --> 01:29:07,638
No!

1097
01:29:10,807 --> 01:29:12,601
God!

1098
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:38,752
Are you bad hurt?

1099
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:44,383
She's dead, Cochise.

1100
01:29:49,429 --> 01:29:51,306
There is one who still lives.

1101
01:29:53,183 --> 01:29:55,060
Give me a knife and bring him to me.

1102
01:29:55,269 --> 01:29:56,228
It will not be done.

1103
01:29:56,395 --> 01:29:57,896
- Bring him to me!
- No.

1104
01:29:58,021 --> 01:29:59,064
It will not be done.

1105
01:30:00,941 --> 01:30:03,110
There are some things
a man cannot bear.

1106
01:30:04,027 --> 01:30:05,070
Do you hear me?

1107
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,739
This peace is a lie!
They don't want peace!

1108
01:30:08,198 --> 01:30:10,742
It is not a lie. I will not
let you make it a lie.

1109
01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:16,373
Did you think peace would come easy?
You, who taught me so well.

1110
01:30:17,165 --> 01:30:19,459
Is it my brother who asks
me to spit on my word?

1111
01:30:19,918 --> 01:30:21,420
Why do you speak to me?

1112
01:30:24,923 --> 01:30:26,508
Speak to her!

1113
01:30:29,344 --> 01:30:31,305
When she hears, I'll hear.

1114
01:30:32,347 --> 01:30:35,726
You will hear me now!
You'll bear this.

1115
01:30:36,727 --> 01:30:38,645
This was not done by the military.

1116
01:30:38,896 --> 01:30:41,773
Geronimo broke the peace
no less than these whites.

1117
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,985
As I bear the murder of my people,
so you will bear...

1118
01:30:45,152 --> 01:30:46,820
...the murder of your wife.

1119
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:51,074
I am Cochise! I do not betray
my people or their children.

1120
01:30:51,867 --> 01:30:54,411
No none on my territory
will open war again.

1121
01:30:55,871 --> 01:30:56,872
Not even you.

1122
01:31:18,769 --> 01:31:21,813
I have given my permission.
They wanted to see you.

1123
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:23,815
Tom...

1124
01:31:25,484 --> 01:31:28,403
...we've come to pay
our respects, Tom.

1125
01:31:28,987 --> 01:31:30,155
Thank you, Milt.

1126
01:31:30,364 --> 01:31:33,617
We rounded up ever man
connected with the ambush.

1127
01:31:34,743 --> 01:31:37,496
They're going to pay
the full penalty for what they done.

1128
01:31:39,331 --> 01:31:40,582
Jeffords...

1129
01:31:42,459 --> 01:31:45,671
...nothing can compensate you for
the terrible thing that happened.

1130
01:31:45,963 --> 01:31:50,801
But your loss has brought our people
together in the will to peace.

1131
01:31:51,385 --> 01:31:54,137
Without that will, treaties are
worth little or nothing.

1132
01:31:58,267 --> 01:32:01,979
<i>His words meant very little to
me then, but as time passed...</i>

1133
01:32:02,145 --> 01:32:05,232
<i>...I came to know that the
death of Sonseeahray...</i>

1134
01:32:05,357 --> 01:32:07,317
<i>...put a seal upon the peace.</i>

1135
01:32:08,193 --> 01:32:10,654
<i>From that day on,
wherever I went...</i>

1136
01:32:10,821 --> 01:32:14,032
<i>...in cities, among the Apaches,
in the mountains...</i>

1137
01:32:14,658 --> 01:32:16,577
<i>...I always remembered...</i>

1138
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:18,912
<i>...my wife was with me.</i>
