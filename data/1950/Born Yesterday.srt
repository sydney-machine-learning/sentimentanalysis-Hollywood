1
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:10,200
Captain!

2
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,519
- Eddie, where's my briefcase?
- I got it here.

3
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,563
Well, hang on to it.

4
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,517
All right, already.
Come on. Come on.

5
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,315
This way, Mr. Brock.

6
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,106
Sorry I missed your
arrival, Mr. Brock.

7
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,301
Welcome to the Washington Statler.

8
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:09,278
- I've been inspecting your wing...
- I ain't got a whole floor?

9
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,197
You've got an entire
wing, Mr. Brock.

10
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,074
When I say I want a whole
floor, I don't want one wing.

11
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:15,034
I don't want two wings.
I want the whole bird.

12
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,036
Your private elevator.

13
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,357
Private, huh? That's more like it.

14
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,351
- Hello, Mr. Brock.
- How are you?

15
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,294
- Mr. Brock, Mr. Devery...
- I thought you said this was private.

16
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,397
What are you waitin' for? Take off.

17
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,133
You'll be more than satisfied.

18
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:33,469
This is the public
corridor and elevators.

19
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,638
No need to use them,
but you may if...

20
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,663
The west, east and
south suites, all duplex.

21
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:40,977
- Which one's mine?
- The south suite.

22
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:43,158
Each one a completely private
and separate apartment.

23
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,481
This is it.

24
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,066
Sleeping quarters upstairs.

25
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,090
Terrace overlooks
half of Washington.

26
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,196
- I would like to point out...
- It's all right.

27
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:55,426
I would like to point out
that this suite is one we...

28
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,959
That this suite is usually
reserved for foreign diplomats.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,004
Oh, I almost forgot.

30
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,153
We thought you might like this.

31
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:13,117
- Compliments of the management.
- Okay, don't bother me.

32
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,620
May I?

33
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,875
May I show you the rest
of the accommodations?

34
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:35,511
Hey, Billie!

35
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,036
What?

36
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,330
Not bad, huh?

37
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,665
- It's all right.
- "All right," she says.

38
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:49,442
- Do you know what this place costs a day?
- 400. You told me.

39
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,557
Mrs. Brock seems delighted
with the arrangements.

40
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,768
- It's not Mrs. Brock.
- Oh?

41
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,497
There ain't no Mrs. Brock
except my mother, and she's dead.

42
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,106
- I see.
- Now, look, don't get nosy.

43
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,609
Well, not at all.

44
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,071
- She's a fiancÃ©e.
- Mine, in fact.

45
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:17,174
Eddie, take care of him.

46
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,951
Pardon me, sir.

47
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:24,372
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Brock.
- Okay, don't bother me.

48
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,226
How's the monarch
of all he surveys?

49
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,045
- You plastered again?
- Still. Welcome to our city.

50
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:33,130
I told you I got a couple
of things that can't wait.

51
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,759
- Hey, son, I got this ticket to get fixed.
- What's it about?

52
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,737
Some louse just as we
blew into town. Here.

53
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:44,016
- Just because I'm a lawyer does
not mean I own the law.
- What'd I do? What'd I do?

54
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,495
All right, I'll see
what I can manage.

55
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,480
- What did we make out?
- It may cost you a shade more than we estimated.

56
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,549
- How much more?
- It's negligible.

57
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,859
- Why more?
- Supply and demand, Harry.

58
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,338
Crooks are becoming
rare in these parts.

59
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,615
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry? This stuff
ain't deductible, you know.

60
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,617
I'm not so sure.

61
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:04,120
Item: One bribe, $80,000.

62
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,191
Eighty? You're very handy
with my dough, you know it?

63
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,710
And you're gonna be interviewed.
Fella's coming up here any minute.

64
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,129
Name's Paul Verrall. He's a writer.

65
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,798
Freelance snoop, political
stuff. Think pieces.

66
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,073
I don't wanna talk to no writers.
I gotta get shaved. Eddie!

67
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,470
- You better talk to this one.
- Why?

68
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,265
This is one of the few fellas
in Washington to look out for.

69
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:27,309
The thing to do is take him
in. Then he doesn't go poking.

70
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,708
What's so important?

71
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:33,065
What we're after here
is pretty important.

72
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,236
Listen, Harry, to get by in this
town takes power. You got some.

73
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,447
Takes money. You got plenty.

74
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,825
But above all, it takes
judgment and intelligence.

75
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:46,370
That's why you pay
me 100,000 a year.

76
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,706
What's all the excitement?

77
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:52,293
Nothing. I'm just trying to
make it clear where I fit in.

78
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:54,503
Eddie, get me a shave up here.

79
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:55,981
Right.

80
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:57,339
- Harry.
- What?

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,758
Barber shop.

82
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,157
Tell Billie to wear something
nice and plain for the congressman.

83
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:04,157
- He may bring his wife.
- Tell her yourself. You ain't pregnant.

84
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:08,350
This is Harry Brock's apartment. Send
up a barber and a manicure right away.

85
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:09,919
Harry Brock.

86
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,855
- That's right. Okay, make it snappy.
- And a shine!

87
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,857
And a shine. Be right up.

88
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:17,359
Look, don't you worry about Billie.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,528
One thing, she knows how to dress.

90
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,098
Probably Verrall.

91
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:26,076
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Jim.

92
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,078
Harry Brock, Paul Verrall.

93
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,289
- How do you do, sir?
- How are ya?

94
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,688
Ain't I seen you
someplace before lately?

95
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,403
- I'll leave you gentlemen.
- Come in. What'll you drink?

96
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,130
- Scotch, please, if you've got it.
- If I got it. Eddie!

97
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,800
I got everything. Where
do you think you are?

98
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,905
Where you been? Stick around and
get this man a scotch and... soda?

99
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,005
- Plain water.
- Plain water.

100
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,598
- Right. Rye ginger ale for you?
- Right.

101
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,558
He always knows
what I feel to drink.

102
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,435
Worked for me I don't
know how many years now.

103
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:54,563
- Also he's my cousin. He knows me insides out.
- That's right.

104
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,440
Maybe I should be
interviewing Eddie.

105
00:06:56,441 --> 00:07:00,653
That's pretty good. Maybe you got
something there. Sit down. Sit down.

106
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,384
Well, what's it gonna
be, pal, a plug or a pan?

107
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:07,351
- Why...
- I know how to talk if I know your angle.

108
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:10,063
- No angle, just the facts.
- Oh, a pan, huh?

109
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,623
- Not exactly.
- That's all right. Write whatever you want.

110
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,458
Look, go on upstairs.
I wanna get shaved.

111
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,837
You can't hurt me. You
can't help me. Nobody can.

112
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,339
I'm only talking here 'cause
Jim Devery asked me to.

113
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,633
I pay a guy 100 grand
a year for advice.

114
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:25,302
- I'm a sucker if I don't take it, right?
- That's right.

115
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,513
Butt out, will ya?

116
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,788
Devery likes it when
I get wrote about.

117
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:35,039
- Well, fella, what do you wanna know?
- How much money you got?

118
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,439
- What?
- How much money you got?

119
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,483
How should I know?
What am I, an accountant?

120
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,485
- You don't know?
- Not exactly.

121
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:43,839
- Fifty million?
- To tell you the truth, I don't know.

122
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,739
- Ten million?
- Maybe.

123
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,449
- One million?
- More!

124
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,451
- How much more?
- Plenty.

125
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,896
- Okay.
- And I made every nickel of it.

126
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:54,540
- Nobody never give me nothing.
- Nice work.

127
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,985
I can see right off you're
gonna give me the business.

128
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:59,355
- Oh, wait a minute...
- That's all right. I like it.

129
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,089
- You got me all wrong.
- Pan me. Tell 'em I'm a roughneck.

130
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,092
Everybody gets scared. For me,
that's good. Everybody scares easy.

131
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,469
- Oh, not everybody.
- Enough.

132
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,471
Look, you can't hurt me.

133
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,724
All you can do is
build me up or shut up.

134
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,934
- Hey, Eddie. Have a drink.
- No, thanks, really.

135
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:17,335
Do what I'm tellin' you.
Who pays you around here?

136
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,965
When we're home, he
shaves me every day.

137
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:25,154
- I got my own barber chair. Right?
- That's right.

138
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:28,490
Go ahead, pal. I thought
you wanted to interview me.

139
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,492
Where were you born?

140
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,495
Jersey. Plainfield,
New Jersey. 1907.

141
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,873
I went to work when
I was 12 years old.

142
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,875
I been workin' ever since.

143
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,461
My first job was a paper route.

144
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:43,441
I bought another kid out with
a swift kick in the keister.

145
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:45,925
- And you've been workin' ever since.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,385
Tell you how I'm
top man in my racket.

147
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:51,013
Been in it over 25
years. Same racket.

148
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:53,015
- Steel.
- Junk.

149
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,017
- Not steel, junk.
- Oh.

150
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,995
Now, look, don't butter me up.

151
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,313
- I'm a junk man. I ain't ashamed to admit it.
- All right.

152
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,191
Let me give you a
little advice, sonny boy.

153
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,361
Never bull a bull artist. I can
sling it with the best of 'em.

154
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,363
- For 25 years, you say.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:10,366
I tell ya, I'm a kid
with a paper route.

156
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:14,328
I got this little wagon. Goin' home nights
I go through the alleys pickin' up junk.

157
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,998
I'm not the only one doing it.
The other kids are doing it too.

158
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,377
The only difference is, they
keep it. Not me. I sell it.

159
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:24,171
And the first thing you know, I'm
makin' seven, eight bucks from junk...

160
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,173
and three bucks from papers.

161
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,175
Right off I can see
which is the right racket.

162
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,928
I'm just a kid, but I can see that.

163
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:33,722
Pretty soon the guy I'm sellin' to is
handing me anywhere from 15 to 20 a week.

164
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:38,143
Then he turns around and offers
me a job for 10. Dumb jerk.

165
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,498
I'd be sellin' him his own stuff
back half the time, and he never knew.

166
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:45,567
- How do you mean?
- Look, in the night, I'm under the fence,

167
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,569
I drag it out, I load it up.

168
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,219
In the morning, I go in
the front way and collect.

169
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,970
- 12 years old you were.
- Yeah, something like that.

170
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:57,246
- So, pretty soon you own the whole yard.
- Right.

171
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,416
Now, this guy, the jerk, he works
for me now. You know who else?

172
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,918
The kid whose paper route I swiped.

173
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,772
I figure I owe him.
That's the way I am.

174
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:10,759
Pretty good years for the
junk business, the last few.

175
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,737
I ain't kickin'.

176
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:16,412
- Do you anticipate any decline now?
- Talk plain, pal.

177
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:19,582
- Is it still going to be good, do you think?
- We'll make it good.

178
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,080
- Who's we?
- "We" is me, that's who.

179
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:24,690
Look, fancy talk don't go with me.

180
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,965
- Come on in.
- Good evening.

181
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:31,613
- Well, I'll get out of your way...
- No, don't go. I like ya.

182
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:35,200
Stick around, play your cards
right, I'll put you on the payroll.

183
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,370
Once over light and no
talk. Just brush 'em up.

184
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,749
- I get a manicure every day.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,978
Over there someplace.

186
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,255
Okay, fella, go ahead. Go ahead.

187
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:51,800
I've been wondering, uh, what
you're doing in Washington.

188
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,886
What are you, some wonder boy?

189
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,888
- Not so tight.
- Sorry, sir.

190
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,223
Sightseeing. That's what
I'm doing in Washington.

191
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,702
Some talk you may be
around for a long time,

192
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,729
- that you've come to find out...
- So far I've been nice to ya. Don't pump me.

193
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,731
How's it going?

194
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,734
How are you getting
on with King Junk?

195
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:12,305
Great. Found out he was born
in Plainfield, New Jersey.

196
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:16,700
- He sure is a tough man to dig.
- I can't believe that.
He loves to talk. Oh, Billie.

197
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,535
This is my friend, Paul
Verrall. Billie Dawn.

198
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,559
How do you do?

199
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:24,817
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

200
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,252
- Where do you think you're going with that?
- To my place.

201
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,447
- Put it back.
- I just wanted to...

202
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:31,924
- I know what you wanted. Put it back.
- Why can't I just...

203
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,119
We got somebody comin',
somebody important.

204
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:37,096
- I don't want you around here stinkin'!
- Well, can't I just...

205
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,099
Go to your room and change your
clothes and don't give me no trouble!

206
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,419
Do what I'm tellin' ya!

207
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,927
Barber, what'll you
take to cut his throat?

208
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,601
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Some kind of jokes I don't like, Jim.

209
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:05,225
- Don't get excited.
- Don't tell me what to do.

210
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,520
Just a joke, Harry.

211
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,838
- That's all.
- I'm not quite finished.

212
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,362
I said beat it. You too.
Eddie, take care of 'em.

213
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,884
- I'll be going too.
- No, don't go. Stick around.

214
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:18,220
You're the only friend
I got left around here.

215
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,389
Well, I live just
around the corner.

216
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,809
If anyone starts beating you, just lean out
the window and scream. I'll come running.

217
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,379
- Bye, Jim. Thanks.
- Good-bye.

218
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,859
- I need Billie's signature on a few things.
- Sure.

219
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,903
Billie!

220
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,905
You sore?

221
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,384
Not sore, Harry.

222
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:42,244
- You look funny.
- I know.

223
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,747
Don't you feel good?
You want an aspirin?

224
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,916
No, no, I'm fine.

225
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,628
In fact, considering I've
been dead for 16 years,

226
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,152
I'm in remarkable health.

227
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,389
Billie!

228
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,600
What?

229
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,669
Billie!

230
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:11,857
- What?
- Come over here right away!

231
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,053
Hey, would you please
fix this safety catch?

232
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:18,173
- He's sure got good lungs.
- Yeah.

233
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,908
- Thanks.
- There's a shortcut through the service.

234
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,432
- This way.
- Oh.

235
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:30,393
- That's the door down there, honey.
- Thanks, honey.

236
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:41,136
Sometime I don't
understand you at all.

237
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,138
Sometime?

238
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,682
- What do you want?
- Jim.

239
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:48,352
A few things I want
you to sign, honey.

240
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:51,313
That's all I do
around here is sign.

241
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,291
Too bad about you.

242
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:56,735
- What time's he comin', this congressman guy?
- Any time now.

243
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,466
I'd better get fixed up, huh?
She look all right to you?

244
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,866
- Look who's talkin'.
- You tell me if something's wrong.

245
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,720
I don't wanna start
off on no left foot.

246
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,415
Well, what got into him?

247
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,585
Nothing. Just wants to
make a good impression.

248
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,734
So let him.

249
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,592
Two places on this one, please.

250
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,929
What happened to all that
stuff I signed last week?

251
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,973
All used up.

252
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:29,351
I bet I must've signed
about a million of these.

253
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,521
What you get for being a
multiple corporate officer.

254
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:35,482
I am? What do you know?

255
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,735
You've come a long way
from the chorus, all right.

256
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,030
I wasn't only in the
chorus. I spoke lines.

257
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,033
- Really?
- Of course.

258
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,011
How many?

259
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:50,122
- How many what?
- Lines did you speak.

260
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,100
Five.

261
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,835
- I never knew that.
- Ask anybody.

262
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,529
I believe you.

263
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:01,155
I could've been a star probably
if I'd have stuck to it.

264
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:05,679
- Why didn't you?
- Well, Harry didn't want me bein' in the show.

265
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,766
He didn't want to share
me with the general public.

266
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,869
I see.

267
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:17,084
He's changed, Harry.
Don't you think so?

268
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:21,236
- How?
- I don't know. He used to be,
like, more satisfied.

269
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,864
Now he's always runnin'
around like this.

270
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,969
And what did he have to
come to Washington, D.C. for?

271
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,746
- Long story.
- Well, don't tell it to me.

272
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:34,818
I don't care where we go.
I just wish he'd settle down.

273
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,835
- He's ambitious.
- I know.

274
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,588
He talks all the time now.
He never used to.

275
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:42,716
Now he's got me up half the night
tellin' me what a big man he is,

276
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:45,115
how he's gonna be
bigger, run everything.

277
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:49,491
- He may at that.
- And personally, I don't care
one way or the other.

278
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:55,270
- Take it easy.
- Look, now, don't you start.

279
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,965
Better if you drink
later, after they're gone.

280
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:00,631
- Who, this congressman guy?
- And Mrs. Hedges.

281
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:03,925
- Harry tells me this fella works for him.
- In a way.

282
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,823
So what he's puttin' it on for?

283
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,803
Now, all you have to do is be
nice. And no rough language.

284
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:12,871
- I won't open my mush.
- I didn't mean that.

285
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,374
I don't have to be
down here at all.

286
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,626
I could go back to my place.

287
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:20,071
In fact, I think I will.

288
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:24,508
- I'm telling you, Billie, Harry wouldn't like it.
- Oh, all right, all right.

289
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,294
- How are you, Norval?
- Can't complain.

290
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,979
- Haven't seen you in a long time, Anna.
- No, you haven't.

291
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,774
Come on in. Congressman, you
ought to remember this little lady,

292
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,752
a great first-nighter like you.

293
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:45,737
- She used to be Billie Dawn.
- Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

294
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,739
Billie, this is
Mr. Norval Hedges...

295
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,741
I've told you so much about.

296
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,719
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

297
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,496
- And this is Mrs. Hedges, Billie.
- Glad to meet you.

298
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,520
Glad to meet ya.

299
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,481
Well, it's a lovely evening.

300
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,674
- How about the terrace?
- Oh, that would be nice.

301
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,259
- What about a drink?
- Love one.

302
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,343
- Sounds all right to me.
- Scotch?

303
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,178
- It'd be fine.
- Scotch all around, Eddie.

304
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,405
Right.

305
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:21,481
- He's awfully tired.
- You've been standing over
a hot resolution all day?

306
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:23,505
Just about.

307
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:37,979
How do you like
Washington, Mrs. Brock?

308
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,965
I haven't seen it yet.

309
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:50,469
You mean to say this is the
very first time you've been here?

310
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,930
That's what I mean.
I never went on the road.

311
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:57,476
Well, we must show you
around. Beautiful city.

312
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:02,355
Too bad the Supreme Court isn't
in session. You'd love that.

313
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:05,005
What is it?

314
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:12,551
Lots of people would like to know
the answer to that one, Billie.

315
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,144
- Hello, everybody.
- Here we are. Mr. Hedges, Harry Brock.

316
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,141
It's about time us two
got together. About time.

317
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,482
- And I suppose this is Mrs. Hedges.
- That's right.

318
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,500
- Well, I'm happy to make your acquaintance.
- Thank you so much.

319
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,524
Sit down. Congressman.

320
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,843
- Have a good trip down?
- Oh, sure.

321
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,555
I come down in my car. Stopped off in
Baltimore. I got a yard there, you know.

322
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:37,579
Junkyard. Second one I picked up.

323
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,644
- Before that, I only had one yard.
- How many do you have now?

324
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,747
I couldn't answer that one, baby...

325
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,275
- Excuse me.
- Oh, that's all right.

326
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,819
I don't know why I like
this little Baltimore outfit.

327
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,264
I kinda get a feeling from
it. You know what I mean?

328
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,824
- Sentimental.
- That's it. I'm sentimental, like you say.

329
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:59,120
- Well, I think we're all a bit sentimental.
- Yeah.

330
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:02,441
Well, it's a free country.

331
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,090
Do you play bridge, Mrs. Brock?

332
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:12,865
No. Only gin.

333
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,303
- I beg your pardon?
- Gin rummy.

334
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,305
Oh, yes, of course.

335
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,831
Well, I was going to ask you
to join us, a few of the girls.

336
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,704
- We meet now and then.
- Well, I don't play bridge.

337
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,565
- You could learn if you wanted.
- I don't think so.

338
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,149
Sure, you could.

339
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,718
She couldn't play gin
till I learned her.

340
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,179
Now she beats my brains out.

341
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:35,865
How are you fixed for
time tomorrow, Norval?

342
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:37,701
I wanted to bring Harry
over on a few things.

343
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,245
- 10:00 all right?
- That's pretty early for me.

344
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,144
I'll say.

345
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,626
- 11:00?
- Okay.

346
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:49,004
I can drop by here,
if that's all right.

347
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,797
Sure. It's right on your way.

348
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,993
We can discuss the entire operation
at that time and get a head start.

349
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,955
You wanna wash your
hands or anything, honey?

350
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,190
I, uh, hope you're
free Friday night.

351
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,318
Doing a little dinner. A few
people I want Harry to meet.

352
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,237
And who'd want to
meet him, I'm sure.

353
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:17,282
I want to thank you, Mr.
Brock, for everything.

354
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,367
Call me Harry, will
ya, Congressman?

355
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:22,037
I haven't written you about it,
Harry, because... Well, you understand.

356
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:24,456
Look, Congressman, you
know what I'm interested in.

357
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,375
Scrap iron. I wanna buy it. I
wanna move it. I wanna sell it.

358
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,399
I don't wanna get stuck on
account of no falling prices.

359
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,275
- I have a copy for you of the preliminary...
- Give it to me fast.

360
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,367
I didn't come down here to do
a lot of paperwork.

361
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:38,595
The way I work is like this:
It's every man for himself.

362
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:41,765
Like dog-eat-dog, Like you gotta
get the other guy before he gets you.

363
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:45,352
I got in mind an operatin'
combo all over the world.

364
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,646
There's enough in it for
everybody, if they're in, that is.

365
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,731
Up till now, I'm just doing fine.

366
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,816
Everybody's lined up, and
everybody understands everybody.

367
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,486
I wanna get movin', see?

368
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,364
I'm sure you understand, Harry,
in legislation of this kind...

369
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:59,199
Listen, that, to me, is
just a lot of hot air.

370
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,201
I ain't talkin' about peanuts.

371
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:03,244
...this jam the committee's
gotten itself into.

372
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:06,224
Give them enough
rope. I've said so...

373
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:13,902
The trouble with these
professional do-gooders is...

374
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:16,007
They never seem to know when to stop.

375
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,386
I've said that...

376
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:22,097
There's a way to
get this thing done,

377
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,075
and it's up to you and
Jim to find out how.

378
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,376
Yes, the Hedges-Keller Amendment, for
example, guarantees government support...

379
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:31,124
of scrap iron price
levels, foreign or domestic.

380
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:33,942
- We're doing everything we can
to get it through quickly.
- See that you do.

381
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:36,945
That's why I'm here... to see
that I get what I paid for.

382
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,447
Uh, how do things
look to you, Norval?

383
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,199
- Generally?
- Yes, generally.

384
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,951
I said to Sam only last week,

385
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:45,203
this country will
soon have to decide...

386
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,831
if the people are going
to run the government...

387
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:49,791
or the government is
going to run the people.

388
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,501
That's good, sound
thinking, Norval.

389
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:52,569
Thank you.

390
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:55,672
- Worthy of Holmes.
- Great man, Holmes.

391
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:58,743
- My personal god.
- Who?

392
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,637
- Oliver Wendell Holmes.
- A wonderful man.

393
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,306
He gonna be here Friday night?

394
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:08,560
- I don't think so.
- Too bad.

395
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,210
- Well, we mustn't keep you.
- No, we mustn't.

396
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,773
- Good night, Mrs. Brock.
- Good night.

397
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,442
- Good night, Norval.
- Good night, Jim.

398
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:17,277
- See you tomorrow at 11:00.
- That's right.

399
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:19,380
Good night, Anna.
It's been so nice.

400
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,489
- Good night, and thank you so much.
- For what?

401
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,493
Wait till I'm down here a while. I'll
give you something to thank me for.

402
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,596
Good night, all.

403
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,491
- Drips.
- What?

404
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,994
- I said they're drips.
- Who are you to say?

405
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:53,021
- Myself, that's who.
- Well, nobody asked you. Shut up.

406
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,921
Pardon me for living.

407
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,067
- Get lost.
- Not yet.

408
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,966
Get lost, I told ya!

409
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,562
She's gonna be in
the way, that dame.

410
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:18,546
- What are you going to do about it?
- I feel like I give her the brush.

411
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,883
- Pretty complicated.
- Yeah, I know.

412
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,885
She owns more of you
than you do on paper.

413
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:27,832
She's gonna louse me up all the
way down the line. Dumb broad.

414
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,600
You may be right.

415
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:32,685
Listen, Harry. Send her home.

416
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:34,959
- No.
- Why not?

417
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:39,214
I'm nuts about her.

418
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,713
- Can't have your cake and eat it.
- What?

419
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:44,239
- Just a saying.
- That don't make any sense.

420
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,842
All right.

421
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:52,080
What's cakes got to do with it?

422
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:54,040
Nothing, Harry.

423
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,610
Must be a way we can smarten
her up a little, ain't there?

424
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:59,822
- I suppose so.
- Some kind of school we can send her to, maybe?

425
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,840
- I doubt that.
- Then what?

426
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:05,536
Well, we might be able to find someone
who could smooth the rough edges off.

427
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:08,327
- How?
- Let me think about it.

428
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,417
And there's something I'd
like you to think about.

429
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,476
- What?
- About marrying her right away.

430
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:16,330
What's so important I should
get married all of a sudden?

431
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:20,108
If you ever got dragged into court, a
wife couldn't testify against her husband.

432
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:21,860
Anyway, you've been
engaged for seven years.

433
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,780
- I've never understood why you waited this long.
- I didn't want to be rushed.

434
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:27,615
Look this way, I give her
somethin', I'm a swell fella.

435
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:29,593
We get married, she's
got it comin' she thinks.

436
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,971
- Billie's not like that.
- A broad's a broad.

437
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,372
- A time may come, you'll be sorry.
- I'll let you know.

438
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,292
If I do or don't, we still
gotta do somethin' about her.

439
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:40,613
Every time she opened her kisser
tonight, somethin' wrong come out.

440
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:43,858
- Couldn't you talk with her?
- It'd take more than a talk.

441
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:47,078
- Then what?
- It's not easy to make a person over.

442
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,512
- Maybe impossible.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

443
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:52,742
Th-Th-That interview guy. What's his
name again? There's a pretty smart cookie.

444
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:54,809
- Verrall. Paul Verrall.
- He knows this town, knows the angles.

445
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,662
He's very classy with that bowing.

446
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:58,630
- He could do it, but he won't.
- Why not?

447
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,670
- He's not...
- I'll pay him whatever he wants.

448
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:04,011
- I don't think so.
- I'll make you a bet. What's his number?

449
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,404
- Harry, I'm not sure...
- I like it! What's his number?

450
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,428
Come on, come on, come on.

451
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,558
- You ate already, huh?
- Yeah.

452
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,976
- You want a piece of pie or something?
- No, thanks.

453
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,941
- Sit down. How about a drink?
- No, thanks.

454
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:27,675
Okay, pal, I wanna
ask you something.

455
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,469
Sure.

456
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,696
How much you make a week?

457
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:34,496
- How should I know? What am I, an accountant?
- I love this guy.

458
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:36,084
- What's your name again?
- Verrall.

459
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,102
- No, I mean your regular name.
- Paul.

460
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,173
Paul, I'll give you the layout.
I got a friend, a good kid...

461
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,543
- Oh, maybe you seen her around. Billie?
- Oh, yes.

462
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,527
She's a good kid, but to tell you the
truth, but she's a little on the stupid side.

463
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:49,030
It's not her fault. I
got her out of the chorus.

464
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:51,032
For the chorus, she
was smart enough,

465
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,010
but I'm afraid she's gonna
be unhappy around this town.

466
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:56,014
- Never been around such people.
You know what I mean?
- No, I don't.

467
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,540
- I figure a guy like you
could help her out. Me too.
- How?

468
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,876
Show her the ropes, sort of.
Kind of explain things to her.

469
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:05,004
In your spare time.
What do you say?

470
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,006
No, I don't think I could
handle it, Mr. Brock.

471
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,825
Mean an awful lot to me.

472
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:12,325
I'll give you 200 bucks a week.

473
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,558
- All right, I'll do it.
- I'm tellin' you, I love this guy.

474
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,062
- When do I start?
- Right now. Why not right now?

475
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:23,564
- Fine.
- Come with me, and I'll introduce you.

476
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,963
And you can take it from there.

477
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,992
- Billie!
- What?

478
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:37,203
Come down here a
minute. Come on in.

479
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:39,853
She's a nice kid.
You're gonna like her.

480
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:45,086
- I'm gettin' dressed.
- It's all right. He's a friend of the family.

481
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:48,282
Come on, I'm tellin' ya!

482
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:54,910
- Honey, this is Paul Verrall.
- Yes, I know.

483
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,390
- He wants to talk to you.
- What about?

484
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:00,393
You'll find out. Look, Jim
and I got some work to work on.

485
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,667
I'm gonna have to leave you two.

486
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:19,120
Uh, your, uh, friend,
Mr. Brock, has an idea.

487
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:22,331
He'd like us to spend
a little time together.

488
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:24,333
You and me, that is.

489
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,732
- You don't say.
- Yes.

490
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:30,298
- What are you, some kind of gigolo?
- Not exactly.

491
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,300
Well, what's the idea?

492
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,469
Well, it's nothing special.

493
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,138
Uh, he'd just like me to
put you wise to a few things,

494
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:40,459
uh, show you the ropes,
answer any questions.

495
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:43,352
- I got no questions.
- Well, I'll give you some.

496
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:46,147
Thanks.

497
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:48,649
You know, it might be
fun for you in a way.

498
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,318
There's a lot to see down here.

499
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,467
I'd be glad to show you around.

500
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:54,465
- You know the Supreme Court?
- Yes.

501
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,639
- I'd like to take that in.
- Fine.

502
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,137
- We're on then, huh?
- How you mean?

503
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:04,312
- Uh, the arrangement.
- I don't mind. Got nothing much to do.

504
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,312
- Good.
- What's he payin' you?

505
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:10,406
- Uh, 200 a week.
- Sucker. You could've got more.

506
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,526
- He's got plenty.
- Oh, I'd have done it for free.

507
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,277
- Hoo-hoo.
- I would.

508
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,575
- Why?
- This isn't work. I like it.

509
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,849
- He thinks I'm too stupid, huh?
- Uh, no.

510
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,644
He's right. I'm
stupid, and I like it.

511
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,187
You do?

512
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:30,900
Sure. I'm happy. I got everything
I want. Two mink coats, everything.

513
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,925
There's somethin' I want, I ask.

514
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:37,657
If he don't act friendly,

515
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,868
I don't act friendly.

516
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:42,870
Uh-huh.

517
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:46,692
So, as long as I know how to get
what I want, that's all I wanna know.

518
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:50,028
- As long as you know what you want.
- Sure.

519
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:53,240
- What?
- As long as you know what you want.

520
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:57,453
- Are you tryin' to mix me up?
- Well, no.

521
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,585
- Well, I'll tell you what I would like.
- Yes.

522
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:09,332
- I'd like to learn how to talk good.
- All right.

523
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:12,400
- Is it hard to learn?
- I don't think so.

524
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,527
What do I have to do?

525
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:17,572
Well, I might give you a
few books to start with.

526
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:21,849
And then every now and then, I'll
correct you if you don't mind.

527
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,579
- Go ahead.
- Well, that is, when I know.

528
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,899
I... I don't talk so good myself.

529
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,916
- You'll do.
- Good.

530
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,690
I never say "ain't." Did
you notice that? Never.

531
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:33,735
- Oh, I do.
- I'll correct you then.

532
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:37,592
- Do that.
- Since I was very small, I never say it.

533
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:40,572
We had this teacher. She used
to slug you if you did it.

534
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,573
- Did what?
- Said "ain't."

535
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:44,416
- Oh.
- So I got out of the habit.

536
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:47,768
- You think it was worth the slugging?
- Oh, not hard.

537
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,873
It's the principle of the thing. There's
too much slugging. I don't believe in it.

538
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:54,343
- All right, I don't believe in it either.
- Good.

539
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,588
- I learn pretty fast, don't I?
- You're great, Miss Dawn.

540
00:29:57,613 --> 00:30:00,615
- Billie.
- Billie. Sort of an odd name, isn't it?

541
00:30:00,616 --> 00:30:03,435
What are you talkin'? Half
the kids I know are named it.

542
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:07,352
- Anyway, it isn't my real name.
- Oh? What is?

543
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,375
- Holy cats. Emma.
- Well, what's the matter?

544
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,295
Well, do I look to
you like an Emma?

545
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:17,882
No. You don't look
like a Billie either.

546
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,281
So what do I look like?

547
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,530
- To me?
- Yeah, you.

548
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:25,556
You look like a lovely girl.

549
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,876
Oh.

550
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:32,313
Let me ask you.

551
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:35,816
Are you one of these talkers...

552
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:39,237
or would you be interested
in a little action?

553
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,840
What?

554
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,408
I got a yen for you right off.

555
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,728
Well, do you get many?

556
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,622
- Now and then.
- What do you do about 'em?

557
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,896
Stick around, you'll find out.

558
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,877
- All right, I will.
- And if you want a tip, I'll tell you.

559
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:58,506
Sweet-talk me. I like it.
Like that "lovely girl" line.

560
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:01,676
Don't worry about him.
He don't see a thing.

561
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:04,512
He's too dizzy from
bein' a big man.

562
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:07,662
Well, this is gonna be a
little different than I thought.

563
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:10,127
- Do you mind?
- No.

564
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:14,089
- It's only fair. We'll educate each other.
- Yeah.

565
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,774
- Uh, about those books...
- Yes.

566
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,776
I'll look around my place.

567
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:21,529
If there's anything interesting,
I'll drop it back later.

568
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,531
All right.

569
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:26,534
You can drop it by even
if it's not so interesting.

570
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:28,603
Hey!

571
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,291
You two gonna get together?

572
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,918
Uh, I-I think we're all set.

573
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,212
Great. Great. Appreciate it.

574
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,589
So do I.

575
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,785
Well, I guess...
I guess I'll be going.

576
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:48,495
So long, kid!

577
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,663
So long, kid.

578
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,294
Gin!

579
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:08,672
Forty-one.

580
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:11,596
- Forty-one?
- Forty-one!

581
00:34:57,496 --> 00:35:01,248
If you pay attention, that
Verrall guy can do you some good.

582
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:03,522
All right.

583
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:12,051
You're in the big league now, and
I want you should watch your step.

584
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:14,075
All right.

585
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:18,641
You gotta learn to fit in.

586
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:22,212
Can't have you around if you
don't, and that's no bull.

587
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:28,400
Have to be careful of what
you do and what you say.

588
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:30,424
Three!

589
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,511
Twenty-eight.

590
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,730
- Twenty-eight?
- Twenty-eight!

591
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:57,012
You could use a little education
yourself, if you ask me.

592
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:58,681
- Who asked ya?
- Nobody.

593
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:00,329
So shut up!

594
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,377
Sss.

595
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:18,351
- Can't I talk?
- Go on. Play your cards.

596
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,669
It's a free country.

597
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,364
That's what you think.

598
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:39,513
<i>Da da da da da doo doo doo doo</i>

599
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:42,850
<i>Doo-doo-doo doo-doo, baby</i>

600
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:46,520

601
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,522

00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:05,873
<i>Da da da da da da da...</i>

608
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,942
Do you mind?

609
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,819
Gin.

610
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,449
Thirty-four.

611
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,918
- Thirty-four?
- Thirty-four!

612
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,733
- Schneider!
- Where do you get that Schnei...

613
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:34,735
$55.60.

614
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:37,055
All right, that's enough.

615
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:39,865
- Pay me now.
- What's the matter? Don't you trust me?

616
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,950
Sore loser!

617
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:43,827
Shut up!

618
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:48,274
$55.60.

619
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,924
Thanks.

620
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,830
You gonna play like that all night?

621
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:29,899
What?

622
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:41,194
Hurt your eyes.

623
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:52,294
<i>Gee, I like to see
you lookin' swell</i>

624
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:55,399
<i>Da da da da da, baby</i>

625
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,486
<i>Diamond bracelets
Woolworth doesn't sellâª</i>

626
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,419
- Hello.
- Hello.

627
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,505
I, uh, tried your suite. No answer.

628
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:22,092
Yeah, I know. I'm not in.

629
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,303
- Morning papers.
- Oh.

630
00:39:24,304 --> 00:39:27,328
You could've saved yourself the
trouble. I don't read papers.

631
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:31,435
- Never?
- Once in a while the back part, the funnies.

632
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:34,710
Oh, I think you should. The
front part, the not-so-funnies.

633
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,505
- Why?
- Well, because it's interesting.

634
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:40,861
- Not to me.
- Well, how do you know if you never read it?

635
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,238
Look, if you're gonna
turn out to be a pest,

636
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:46,058
we can call the whole
thing off right now.

637
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:49,703
- Sorry.
- Oh. Well, I look at the paper sometimes.

638
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:53,040
But I just never understand
it, so what's the sense?

639
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,042
I tell you what you do.

640
00:39:55,043 --> 00:39:57,920
You look through these, and
anything you don't understand,

641
00:39:57,921 --> 00:40:00,506
why, just make a circle around it.

642
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:02,860
Then tomorrow I'll
explain whatever I can.

643
00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:04,885
- All right?
- All right.

644
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:07,387
And I thought you might like these.

645
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:09,582
Well, I'll try.

646
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:15,437
Look, just start reading. If you don't
like it, stop. Start something else.

647
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:18,792
Oh, there's only one thing:
My eyesight isn't so hot.

648
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,511
- Well, why don't you wear glasses?
- Glasses?

649
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:24,097
- Sure. Why not?
- 'Cause they're terrible.

650
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,404
Of course they're
not so bad on men.

651
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,205
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night.

652
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:11,265
Hello!

653
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:16,728
Miss Dawn around?

654
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:21,737
- Have you seen Miss Dawn?
- In her room.

655
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,619
- Hello!
- Yeah!

656
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,910
- Ready to start.
- Come on up!

657
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:03,571
Hello.

658
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:07,279
Hello.

659
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:11,970
Been reading, huh? That's good.

660
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:13,972
Yeah.

661
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:16,496
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

662
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,088
Uh, did you have
your breakfast yet?

663
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,238
- And lunch.
- Oh.

664
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,617
There's a few things here.

665
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,641
Which?

666
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,511
Read it out.

667
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:55,722
You want me to read?

668
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:59,476
Billie, I... I feel that
things are complicated enough...

669
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,706
without complicating them further.

670
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:08,341
I oughta take this pencil
and make a circle around you.

671
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:15,909
- Now, here are a few of
the places you oughta see.
- A few?

672
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,911
Let's start with the Capitol.

673
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:20,414
I'll tell you all I
know about it first,

674
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:22,374
and then we'll join
one of the tours.

675
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,543
Senate's in session today. We
might be able to take that in.

676
00:43:24,544 --> 00:43:29,024
But first let's go to the
rotunda. It's famous for...

677
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:32,259
- Come on. You'll find it interesting.
- I'm comin'.

678
00:43:41,144 --> 00:43:44,748
...starting with the
landing of the Pilgrims...

679
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,457
...of the spirit of
George Washington.

680
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:08,128
Washington is the figure with
the purple robe across his lap.

681
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:12,299
The figures around him
represent liberty and victory...

682
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,052
and the 13 original states.

683
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:18,930
Brumidi did most of that work
while lying on his back...

684
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:23,018
on a scaffold built from
the floor to the dome,

685
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:27,355
a distance of 180
feet and three inches.

686
00:44:27,356 --> 00:44:29,983
Now, if you will follow me...

687
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:34,488
How could anybody paint
upside down like that?

688
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:37,012
Hey, give me one of those.

689
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:52,573
- Hello.
- How are ya?

690
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,319
Woo-oo-oo-oo!

691
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:51,341
- Hello.
- Come here. I wanna show you something.

692
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:58,513
There's the Constitution.

693
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:03,451
The Declaration of Independence.

694
00:46:03,452 --> 00:46:05,520
And come here.

695
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:11,861
And the Bill of Rights.

696
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:14,963
- Know how old these Rights are?
- Oh, about 160 years.

697
00:46:14,964 --> 00:46:16,941
Who told you?

698
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:20,161
- What else do you know about them?
- What else?

699
00:46:21,596 --> 00:46:23,597
What else?

700
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:26,850
Well, for instance, this whole
country is practically founded...

701
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,935
on these three pieces of paper.

702
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,164
This whole country?

703
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:40,238
"The right of the people
to keep and bear arms...

704
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,449
shall not be 'infrin'."

705
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,451
Infringed.

706
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:47,579
It's a good thing they got
this covered with glass.

707
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,604
I'd be makin' circles all over it.

708
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:53,732
How about some ice cream?

709
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,449
Anything but tutti-frutti!

710
00:46:59,926 --> 00:47:01,927
- How is chocolate?
- Fine.

711
00:47:01,928 --> 00:47:04,781
I think I like you
better with them on.

712
00:47:04,805 --> 00:47:07,704
- What?
- Your glasses.

713
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:15,941
Thanks. You know,
chocolate's the most popular.

714
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,943
I read that.

715
00:47:17,944 --> 00:47:20,946
You know, it's interesting
how many interesting things...

716
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:23,615
a person could learn if they read.

717
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:26,534
I don't suppose you got
a chance to read my piece.

718
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:30,247
What are you talkin'? Of
course I read it. Twice.

719
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,249
What did you think?

720
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,001
I think it's the best
thing I ever read.

721
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,525
I didn't understand one word.

722
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:41,276
- What didn't you understand?
- None of it.

723
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:45,572
Here. Show me what.

724
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:58,316
What's so funny? That
I'm blind, practically?

725
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:01,170
Practically blind.

726
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:03,863
- Practically blind?
- You're wonderful.

727
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:06,366
I'm sorry I look funny to you.

728
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:09,035
Don't be. They make you
look lovelier than ever.

729
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:11,746
You sound like one of
those ads for eyeglasses.

730
00:48:11,747 --> 00:48:13,873
Now, what didn't you understand?

731
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,209
Well, like the name of it.

732
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,045
"The Yellowing
Democratic Manifesto."

733
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:21,631
- Simple.
- To who?

734
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,883
Whom? Who?

735
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:26,237
Anyway, not to me.

736
00:48:26,262 --> 00:48:29,389
- Well, you know what "yellowing" means.
- Not this time.

737
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,040
Well, when a piece of paper
gets old, what happens to it?

738
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,414
- Throw it away?
- No. It turns yellow.

739
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:38,416
- It does?
- Of course.

740
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:42,527
- What do you know?
- Now, "democratic." You know what that means?

741
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,676
Not Republican.

742
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,199
Well, not exactly. It means...

743
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,078
Well, it just means pertaining to our
form of government, which is a democracy.

744
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,080
Oh.

745
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:56,082
What's "pertaining"?

746
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,084
Has to do with.

747
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:00,108
"Pertaining." Nice word.

748
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:02,778
- All right. "Manifesto."
- I don't know.

749
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:07,010
- Why didn't you look it up?
- I did look it up. I still don't know.

750
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,095
Well, look, when I say "manifesto,"

751
00:49:09,096 --> 00:49:12,974
I mean a set of rules and
principles and ideals and hopes...

752
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:15,268
on which the United
States is based.

753
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:18,464
The ideas of those men who
wrote that Constitution up there.

754
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:21,441
- So you think it's turning yellow?
- Yes.

755
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:25,092
I think a lot of the original inspiration
has been neglected and forgotten.

756
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:27,556
- And that's bad.
- And that's bad.

757
00:49:31,786 --> 00:49:35,330
- "Even a... cursory...
- Cursory.

758
00:49:35,331 --> 00:49:38,333
Examination of contemporary...

759
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:41,419
society in terms of the Greek...

760
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,130
philosophy, which
defines the whole...

761
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:47,133
as a representation of its parts...

762
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:50,637
sends one immediately
to the consideration...

763
00:49:50,638 --> 00:49:53,306
of the individual as a citizen...

764
00:49:53,307 --> 00:49:55,517
and the citizen as an individual."

765
00:49:55,518 --> 00:49:57,560
Well?

766
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,790
I looked up every word.

767
00:50:02,775 --> 00:50:04,776
Listen.

768
00:50:04,777 --> 00:50:08,029
Thousands of years ago,
a Greek philosopher said...

769
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:11,866
that the world could only be as
good as the people who lived in it.

770
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:13,868
Makes sense.

771
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:16,413
So I said, you take one
look at America today...

772
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:20,291
and you figure you'd better take a look
at the people in it, one by one, sort of.

773
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:22,736
- Yeah.
- That's all.

774
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,004
- That's this?
- Sure.

775
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:29,076
Well, why didn't you say so?

776
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:17,432
What's the name of this
number, did you say?

777
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:20,602
Beethoven's Second
Symphony, Opus 36.

778
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:23,104
I didn't ask you who made it up.

779
00:51:23,105 --> 00:51:26,175
I just asked you
what's the name of it.

780
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:45,937
- Here. Wait a minute.
- Huh?

781
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:52,360
- There.
- Thanks.

782
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:59,098
- I can't get over it.
- Music that bad?

783
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,935
The music? No, it was swell.

784
00:52:01,936 --> 00:52:03,937
Well, then what?

785
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:07,087
I got a letter
today from my father.

786
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,084
- New York?
- Yeah.

787
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:11,319
- I can't get over it.
- Why?

788
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,114
Well, it's the first time he ever
wrote me in about eight years.

789
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:17,951
We had a fight, sort of.

790
00:52:17,952 --> 00:52:20,912
He didn't want me to go with Harry.

791
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:22,890
What does he do?

792
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:24,916
- My father?
- Yeah.

793
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:27,418
Gas company. He
used to read meters.

794
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:31,714
But in this letter, it says how he
can't get around so good anymore,

795
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,968
so they gave him a
different job, elevator man.

796
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:36,970
He's a goofy old guy.

797
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:40,014
He used to take a little frying
pan and a can of Sterno...

798
00:52:40,015 --> 00:52:42,600
to work every morning
and cook his own lunch.

799
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:46,354
He said everybody
should have a hot lunch.

800
00:52:46,355 --> 00:52:49,315
I swear, I don't
know how he did it.

801
00:52:49,316 --> 00:52:51,818
There were four of us...
me and my three brothers.

802
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:53,820
He had to do everything.

803
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:56,155
My mother died. I never knew her.

804
00:52:56,156 --> 00:53:00,159
He used to feed us and give us
our baths and buy our clothes.

805
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,183
Everything...

806
00:53:03,664 --> 00:53:05,957
That's why all my
life, I used to think...

807
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:09,153
how someday I'd
like to pay him back.

808
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:15,466
It's funny how it worked out.

809
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:19,596
One night I brought home
$100 and gave it to him.

810
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,745
You know what he did?

811
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:27,437
Well, it sure didn't
do the plumbing no good.

812
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:30,690
I thought he was gonna
hit me sure, but he didn't.

813
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:33,260
His whole life he
never hit me once.

814
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:38,140
How'd he happen to write you?
I mean, after all this time?

815
00:53:38,157 --> 00:53:41,117
- Oh, 'cause I wrote him.
- Oh?

816
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:44,313
He says he's thought
about me every day.

817
00:53:45,998 --> 00:53:47,999
Oh, gosh.

818
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,546
I haven't thought about him maybe
but once, even in five years.

819
00:53:53,547 --> 00:53:56,883
Oh, that's nothing against him.

820
00:53:56,884 --> 00:53:59,802
I haven't thought of anything.

821
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,513
Be nice to see him, maybe.

822
00:54:02,514 --> 00:54:04,515
I guess so.

823
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:07,018
He says I should write him again...

824
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:09,896
and I should have a
hot lunch every day...

825
00:54:09,897 --> 00:54:12,857
and I should let him know how I am.

826
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:15,026
But he doesn't want to see me...

827
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:17,654
if I'm still living
in any way unethical.

828
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,822
I looked it up.

829
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:23,284
He always used to say, "Never do
nothin' you wouldn't want printed...

830
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:27,038
on the front page of
the New York Times."

831
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,415
Hey, I just realized...

832
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:34,128
I practically told you the whole
story of my life by now, practically.

833
00:54:34,129 --> 00:54:36,881
I enjoyed it very much.

834
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:39,050
How about the story of your life?

835
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:42,781
Oh, no. Much too long.

836
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:46,496
And mostly untrue.

837
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:19,382
Hey, this is even more gorgeous...

838
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,218
than the Radio City
Music Hall, even.

839
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:25,619
And you notice, it smells nice.

840
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:28,747
It does.

841
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,731
- Come on. Sit down.
- No.

842
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,755
You're tired.

843
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:40,737
I'm not a bit tired.

844
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,408
See?

845
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,262
You know that little thing
you gave me about Napoleon?

846
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:50,810
- No. What?
- By Robert G. Ingersoll.

847
00:55:50,831 --> 00:55:53,935
- Oh, yes.
- Well, I'm not sure I get that.

848
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:56,669
- Well, there's no deep meaning there.
- There must be.

849
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,649
He says about how he goes and
looks in Napoleon's tomb...

850
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:02,196
- Yeah?
- And he thinks of Napoleon's whole sad life.

851
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:04,218
- Yeah.
- And then in the end,

852
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:07,764
he says he himself would've
rather been a happy farmer.

853
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,766
"And I said...

854
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:14,061
I said I would rather have been a
French peasant and worn wooden shoes.

855
00:56:14,062 --> 00:56:16,564
I would rather have
lived in a hut...

856
00:56:16,565 --> 00:56:19,066
with a vine growing
over the door...

857
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:21,068
and the grapes growing purple...

858
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:24,071
in the kisses of the autumn sun.

859
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:26,908
I would rather have
been that poor peasant...

860
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:29,535
with my loving wife by my side...

861
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:32,205
knitting as the day
died out of the sky,

862
00:56:32,206 --> 00:56:37,293
with my children upon my
knee and their arms about me.

863
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,254
I would rather have
been that man...

864
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:44,967
and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust...

865
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:49,764
than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder...

866
00:56:49,765 --> 00:56:52,493
known as Napoleon the Great."

867
00:56:54,728 --> 00:56:57,313
How do you remember all that stuff?

868
00:57:02,945 --> 00:57:07,221
So he'd rather been a happy
peasant than Napoleon.

869
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:10,641
- So who wouldn't?
- So Harry wouldn't, for one.

870
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,913
- What makes you think that?
- Ask him.

871
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:16,916
He probably never
heard of Napoleon.

872
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:20,191
What's worse, he probably
never heard of a peasant.

873
00:57:22,256 --> 00:57:25,633
- Do you hate him like poison?
- Who, Harry?

874
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:27,635
- Yeah.
- No.

875
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,613
- You don't like him.
- No.

876
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:32,161
- On account of me and him?
- One reason.

877
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,892
- There are lots more.
- What?

878
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:37,562
Think about it, Billie.
You'll see Harry's a menace.

879
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:40,273
Oh, he's not so bad. I seen worse.

880
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:42,468
Has he ever thought
of anyone but himself?

881
00:57:42,484 --> 00:57:46,654
- Who does?
- Millions of people, Billie.

882
00:57:46,655 --> 00:57:49,115
The whole history of
the world is a story...

883
00:57:49,116 --> 00:57:51,594
of the struggle between the
selfish and the unselfish.

884
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:55,413
- I can hear you.
- All that's bad around us is bred by selfishness.

885
00:57:55,414 --> 00:57:58,791
Sometimes selfishness can
even get to be a cause,

886
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:01,460
an organized force,
even a government.

887
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:03,609
And then it's called fascism.

888
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,799
- Can you understand that?
- Sort of.

889
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,968
Well, think about it.

890
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:11,413
You're crazy about me, aren't ya?

891
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:15,516
- Yes.
- That's why you get so mad at Harry.

892
00:58:15,517 --> 00:58:20,646
Listen, I hate his life, what he
does, what he stands for, not him.

893
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:22,940
He just doesn't know any better.

894
00:58:22,941 --> 00:58:24,964
I go for you too.

895
00:58:26,445 --> 00:58:28,593
I'm glad of it.

896
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:39,354
Ooh!

897
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,673
"I have sworn upon
the altar of God...

898
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:53,137
eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny...

899
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:57,618
over the mind of man."

900
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:02,229
- So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh?
- Uh-huh.

901
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,232
You know, I heard
quite a bit about him.

902
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:08,428
I mean, even before
I hit town, even.

903
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:21,896
Come in.

904
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,799
What are you trying to do
with those books, hatch 'em?

905
00:59:32,094 --> 00:59:34,162
Blue?

906
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:38,125
Nice, huh?

907
00:59:39,893 --> 00:59:42,770
"Beethoven, Op. 36."

908
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,772
What's up, Billie?

909
00:59:44,773 --> 00:59:47,217
It's all on account of you
I started doin' all this.

910
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:51,404
- I guess you know.
- No, I didn't.

911
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:53,698
A lot of good it did me.

912
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:57,076
I never had this kind of
trouble before, I can tell you.

913
00:59:57,077 --> 01:00:00,413
- Trouble?
- Sure.

914
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:02,456
After that first
night when I met ya,

915
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:05,084
I figured everything
was gonna work out dandy.

916
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:08,045
Then when you wouldn't...
step across the line,

917
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:11,241
I figured maybe the way to
you is through your head.

918
01:00:13,385 --> 01:00:15,408
Well, no.

919
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:19,390
Well, anyway, what's the diff now?

920
01:00:19,391 --> 01:00:23,041
Difference. But I like ya, anyway.

921
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,355
- It's too late for the rest.
- Why?

922
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,608
Why? Oh, look, Paul.

923
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:34,321
There's a certain time between a fella
and a girl when it either comes off or not.

924
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:36,574
If it doesn't then,
then it never does.

925
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,784
Maybe we haven't
got to our time yet.

926
01:00:38,785 --> 01:00:42,621
I think we did, and
you dropped the ball.

927
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:45,458
Don't be so sure.

928
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:48,938
I never thought I'd go through
a thing like this for anybody.

929
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:52,298
- Like what?
- Like gettin' all mixed up in my head...

930
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:56,677
like wondering and worrying
and thinking, stuff like that.

931
01:00:56,678 --> 01:00:58,846
Last night, I went to
bed. I started to think.

932
01:00:58,847 --> 01:01:02,141
I couldn't fall
asleep for 10 minutes.

933
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:06,187
I never know if it's good
to find out so much so quick.

934
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:08,647
Nobody's born smart, Billie.

935
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:11,467
You know what the stupidest
thing on Earth is? An infant!

936
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:14,820
- What do ya got against babies all of the sudden?
- Nothing.

937
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:18,157
I got nothing against a brain
that's three weeks old and empty.

938
01:01:18,158 --> 01:01:21,182
But after it hangs around for 30
years and hasn't absorbed anything,

939
01:01:21,203 --> 01:01:24,056
- I begin to wonder about it.
- What makes you think I'm 30?

940
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,058
- I didn't mean you.
- Oh, yes, you did!

941
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,356
- I swear it.
- You certainly know how to get me sore!

942
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:30,979
- I'm sorry.
- Thirty! Do I look 30 to you?

943
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:34,153
- No. I don't know.
- Then why'd you say it for?

944
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:36,777
- How old are you?
- Twenty-nine.

945
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:44,577
Don't stop it. I meant,
don't stop studying.

946
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,795
Will ya?

947
01:01:48,355 --> 01:01:51,357
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

948
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,652
It's sort of a cause. I
want everybody to be smart.

949
01:01:54,653 --> 01:01:56,904
I want 'em to be as
smart as they can be.

950
01:01:56,905 --> 01:02:00,032
A world full of ignorant people
is too dangerous to live in.

951
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:04,309
I know. That's why I
wish I was doin' better.

952
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,455
- You're doing wonderfully.
- It's no use.

953
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,060
Most people would just laugh at me
if they knew what I was trying to do.

954
01:02:10,085 --> 01:02:12,503
- I'm not laughing.
- I am.

955
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:14,857
I started laughing at myself.

956
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:17,383
Who do I think I am anyway?

957
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:29,045
- Once in a while, just for a change.
- Don't try so hard, Billie, please!

958
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:32,773
- You miss the whole point.
- I like to like what's better to like.

959
01:02:32,774 --> 01:02:35,025
There's room for all
sorts of things in you.

960
01:02:35,026 --> 01:02:37,470
The idea of learning is
to be bigger, not smaller.

961
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,822
- You think Fm gettin' bigger?
- Yes.

962
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,267
Glad to hear it.

963
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:46,014
- But all them books?
- It's not only books, Billie.

964
01:02:46,037 --> 01:02:48,372
- I told you a hundred times.
- It's mostly.

965
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:50,749
It is not. Now look, who said this:

966
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,399
"The proper study
of mankind is man."

967
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,587
- I don't know.
- You should.

968
01:02:54,588 --> 01:02:55,754
- Why?
- I told you.

969
01:02:55,755 --> 01:02:57,152
- I forgot.
- Pope.

970
01:02:57,174 --> 01:02:58,799
- The pope?
- Not the pope.

971
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,868
Alexander Pope.

972
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:05,973
- "The proper study"...
- "Of mankind is man."

973
01:03:05,974 --> 01:03:07,326
"Of mankind is man."

974
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,351
- 'Course, that means women too.
- Yes.

975
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,687
Yes, I know.

976
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:15,274
I've been doin' some studyin'
of a different mankind lately,

977
01:03:15,275 --> 01:03:18,319
like the ones you told me...
Thomas Jefferson last week...

978
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,321
and this week, Tom Paine.

979
01:03:20,322 --> 01:03:24,116
And all by myself, I got
to thinkin' about Harry.

980
01:03:24,117 --> 01:03:28,245
He works so hard to get
what he wants, for instance.

981
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:31,123
But he doesn't know what he wants.

982
01:03:31,124 --> 01:03:33,101
More of what he's got, probably.

983
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:37,151
- Money.
- Money, more people to push around, more money.

984
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:40,799
Oh, he's not so bad
as you think he is.

985
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,344
Hello.

986
01:03:43,345 --> 01:03:45,387
Hello, Harry. We were
just talking about you.

987
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,389
Yeah? That ain't
what I pay you for.

988
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,267
She knows enough about me
already. Too much, in fact.

989
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:51,894
- Jim phone?
- No.

990
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:53,292
I had a date with him.

991
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:56,023
- What'd you find out about Torn Paine?
- Oh, he was quite a fella.

992
01:03:56,024 --> 01:03:58,673
- Where was he born? Do you remember?
- London, or England.

993
01:03:58,693 --> 01:04:01,528
- Someplace like that.
- What do you mean, "London or England"?

994
01:04:01,529 --> 01:04:03,614
- That's the same thing.
- It is?

995
01:04:03,615 --> 01:04:06,639
London is in England. London's a
city. England's a whole country.

996
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,229
- I forgot.
- Oh, brother, you've got patience.

997
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:12,039
- Take it easy.
- How can anybody get to be so dumb?

998
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,041
Well, we can't all
know everything, Harry.

999
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:16,611
Who's Tom Paine, for instance?

1000
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:19,356
- What?
- You heard me, Tom Paine.

1001
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,882
- What do I care who he is?
- I know.

1002
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:25,844
So what. If I wanted to know who
he is, I'd know. I just don't care.

1003
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:27,846
Go on, go on. Don't let me butt in.

1004
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:29,848
Which of his books
did you like best?

1005
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:32,498
Oh, well, I didn't read
by him yet, only about him.

1006
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:35,463
- But I made a list.
- Who is Rabbit Maranville?

1007
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,457
- Who?
- Rabbit Maranville.

1008
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:40,234
- I don't know any Rabbits!
- Think you're so smart, huh?

1009
01:04:40,235 --> 01:04:43,362
He used to play shortstop
for the Braves, didn't he?

1010
01:04:43,363 --> 01:04:45,531
What are you, some kind
of genius or something?

1011
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:48,602
- No.
- I hire and fire geniuses every day.

1012
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,662
- I'm sure you do. Where's the list?
- Here.

1013
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:55,017
Well, suppose you start
with The Age of Reason.

1014
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,626
- The Age of Reason?
- Mm-hmm. Then next...

1015
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,946
- Who's Willie Hoppe?
- National billiard champion.

1016
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:01,940
- And it's pronounced "hoppy."
- That's what I said.

1017
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:04,693
- But I didn't ask you, I asked her.
- Sorry.

1018
01:05:04,718 --> 01:05:06,927
- Where were we?
- The Age of Reason.

1019
01:05:06,928 --> 01:05:09,122
Yes. Next, The Rights of Man.

1020
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,140
- The Rights of Man.
- I think that'll...

1021
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,142
- What's a peninsula?
- Shh!

1022
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,144
Don't give me that "shh."
You think you're so smart.

1023
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:17,563
- What's a peninsula? Not you, her.
- It's a...

1024
01:05:17,564 --> 01:05:19,587
It's that new medicine.

1025
01:05:22,527 --> 01:05:24,528
It is not.

1026
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:26,530
What then?

1027
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:29,742
It's a body of land surrounded
on three sides by water.

1028
01:05:29,743 --> 01:05:31,744
So, what's that to know?

1029
01:05:31,745 --> 01:05:33,746
So, what's that
"Sam Paine" to know?

1030
01:05:33,747 --> 01:05:37,207
There's some difference between...
Tom Paine, not "Sam Paine."

1031
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,357
Tom Paine practically
started this whole country.

1032
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:44,548
- You mean he's dead?
- Of course.

1033
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:46,550
What are you learnin'
her about dead people for?

1034
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,719
All I want you to do is to teach
her how to act with live people.

1035
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,013
Well, education is a difficult
thing to control, Harry.

1036
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:53,242
- One thing leads to...
- Work on her, not me.

1037
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:56,143
- No extra charge.
- I don't need nothin' you can tell me.

1038
01:05:56,144 --> 01:05:59,214
Oh, I'm sure we could tell each other
some very interesting things, Harry.

1039
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,858
- What's the idea of that mean?
- Just trying to be friendly.

1040
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:04,860
Who asked you?

1041
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,863
You know, the more I see of
you, I don't like you as much.

1042
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:10,032
For a chump who got no
place, you're awful fresh.

1043
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,117
Now, you better watch
out. I got my eye on you.

1044
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:14,286
All right. We'll both watch out.

1045
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:16,685
If I wanted, I could knock
your block off, if I wanted.

1046
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,481
- Yes, I know.
- All right, just do what you're
supposed to do, and that's all.

1047
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:23,563
- Well, we'll stop for now.
- No, go on, go on.

1048
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,590
- I wanna see how you do it.
- Not just now, if you don't mind.

1049
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:29,843
I've gotta go and lie down. You
don't realize how hard I work.

1050
01:06:29,844 --> 01:06:31,845
Ha, ha. Some joke.

1051
01:06:31,846 --> 01:06:34,556
Two hundred bucks a week,
and I can't even watch.

1052
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,975
Take you on separately,
Harry. Glad to.

1053
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:39,078
Got a special course for
backward millionaires.

1054
01:06:46,528 --> 01:06:48,862
"London or England."

1055
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:50,931
Why don't you give up.

1056
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:05,629
- Harry?
- What?

1057
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:09,883
What's this business we're in
down here? Could you tell me?

1058
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:11,885
What do you mean, 'we'?

1059
01:07:11,886 --> 01:07:14,455
Oh, I figure I'm a sort
of partner, in a way.

1060
01:07:14,472 --> 01:07:16,723
- A silent partner.
- So?

1061
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:18,792
So shut up!

1062
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,396
- I got a right to know.
- You got a right to keep out of my hair too.

1063
01:07:22,397 --> 01:07:25,232
Put your nose in the
book and keep it there!

1064
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:27,234
I don't wanna do anything
if it's against the law.

1065
01:07:27,235 --> 01:07:30,195
- That's one sure thing.
- You'll do what I tell ya!

1066
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:33,532
I think I know what it
is, only I'm not sure.

1067
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:36,160
What's the matter with you?
You're doin' all right, ain't ya?

1068
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:39,060
Somethin' you want
you ain't got, maybe?

1069
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,498
- Yeah.
- What?

1070
01:07:41,499 --> 01:07:44,148
I wanna be like the happy peasant.

1071
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:50,841
All right, I'll buy it for you.
Now, will you quit crabbin'!

1072
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:53,570
Well, I finished finally.

1073
01:07:53,595 --> 01:07:56,680
- Thanks loads for the loan of it.
- How'd you like it, Helen?

1074
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,849
Uh, not me. I don't
go for these stories...

1075
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,810
where everyone has a big
beef against the world.

1076
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,104
Me, I like to look
on the cheerful side.

1077
01:08:04,105 --> 01:08:06,106
Yeah, well you see
of course the point...

1078
01:08:06,107 --> 01:08:08,108
All right! All right!
Can the coffee klatch!

1079
01:08:08,109 --> 01:08:10,678
- You, knock off!
- Sorry, Mr. Brock.

1080
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,466
You don't have to get
so pally with everybody.

1081
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:17,140
- Paul says it's all right.
- Never mind, Paul says. I don't like it.

1082
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,184
- You know what you are?
- What?

1083
01:08:29,797 --> 01:08:32,716
- Antisocial!
- You can say that again.

1084
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:35,161
- Hello.
- Where do you guys think you've been?

1085
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,179
- You know what time it is?
- Sorry.

1086
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,722
- You're always sorry.
- My fault.

1087
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:40,933
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1088
01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:44,664
- How are ya, Billie?
- Superb. A new word.

1089
01:08:46,606 --> 01:08:49,186
- All right! All right! What happened!
- It's just this, Harry.

1090
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:51,193
- It may take a little more time.
- And a little more money.

1091
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:54,821
- Yeah. Why more?
- Well, the amendment has to be redrafted.

1092
01:08:57,575 --> 01:09:00,724
Listen, I don't like you. You make
me feel like some kind of sucker.

1093
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:03,580
- I'm sure Norval is doing his best.
- His best ain't good enough.

1094
01:09:03,581 --> 01:09:05,979
Don't be unreasonable, Harry. There
are a great number of votes up there.

1095
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,603
- Norval is just one guy.
- Well, he's the wrong guy.

1096
01:09:10,588 --> 01:09:12,631
I'm sick and tired of waiting.
Let's get the wheels rollin'.

1097
01:09:12,632 --> 01:09:15,259
We're all in this deal. You pull your
weight or I'll get somebody who can!

1098
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,283
Do you hear me? Good!

1099
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,848
- Quite a temper, hasn't he?
- Don't mind him.

1100
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:24,268
He's always lived at
the top of his voice.

1101
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:26,292
So long, Norval.

1102
01:09:32,318 --> 01:09:34,341
Psst. Psst.

1103
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:43,179
I don't think Harry should
talk to you like that.

1104
01:09:43,204 --> 01:09:46,582
- After all, you're a congressman.
- Oh, well.

1105
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:51,753
I don't think anybody should talk to
a congressman like that or be able to.

1106
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,673
A member of Congress
is a wonderful thing.

1107
01:09:54,674 --> 01:09:58,677
Thank you. You know, I
think I could use a drink.

1108
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:01,622
Oh, sure, Congressman. Come on in.

1109
01:10:03,224 --> 01:10:05,392
The way it looks to me,
if he pushes you around...

1110
01:10:05,393 --> 01:10:08,292
it's like he's pushing a
few million people around.

1111
01:10:08,313 --> 01:10:10,586
- How do you mean?
- The ones who picked you.

1112
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:13,317
- Well, not quite that many.
- How many then?

1113
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:16,903
306,434.

1114
01:10:16,904 --> 01:10:20,157
Well, that's quite
a few to push around.

1115
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,762
You're not one of my constituents
by any chance, are you?

1116
01:10:32,003 --> 01:10:34,379
I mean, are you one of the
people who voted for me?

1117
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,608
Oh, I never voted for anybody.

1118
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:39,259
- Why not?
- I don't know. I wouldn't know how, I guess.

1119
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,261
It's simple. You
just press a button.

1120
01:10:41,262 --> 01:10:43,430
Yeah, but which one?

1121
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:47,476
Well, you listen to the speeches,
you make up your own mind.

1122
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,478
That's all there is to it.

1123
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:53,106
Yeah, but why do you take it from
Harry? That's what I wanna know.

1124
01:10:53,107 --> 01:10:56,068
You're more important than
him. You're a congressman.

1125
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:59,738
Yes, and as such I have
a great many duties...

1126
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:01,740
and responsibilities and...

1127
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:06,161
The operation of government
is very complex.

1128
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:08,121
Why should it be?

1129
01:11:08,122 --> 01:11:11,500
I understand it pretty good in
a book so when Paul tells me.

1130
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:15,151
But when I see somethin' like
this happen, it's like, different.

1131
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:18,882
- How?
- Well, when it gets down to
what should be the laws and...

1132
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:21,736
what shouldn't, is Harry more
important than anybody else?

1133
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:24,680
- No.
- Then how come he's got so much to say?

1134
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:26,704
Who ever voted for him?

1135
01:11:31,396 --> 01:11:34,716
Well, we'll have a nice
long talk about it sometime.

1136
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:39,508
All right.

1137
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,947
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1138
01:11:41,948 --> 01:11:43,971
And thank you.

1139
01:11:53,418 --> 01:11:57,963
- Quite a little girl.
- Oh, yeah.

1140
01:11:57,964 --> 01:12:00,757
- Billie?
- Come in.

1141
01:12:00,758 --> 01:12:04,078
Uh, will you come inside?
A few things for you.

1142
01:12:13,604 --> 01:12:15,627
Sign those, will ya, honey?

1143
01:12:18,818 --> 01:12:21,762
- What is this?
- Same old stuff.

1144
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:25,490
- What?
- Take too long to explain.

1145
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:28,702
No, it wouldn't. I like
having things explained to me.

1146
01:12:28,703 --> 01:12:30,680
I found that out.

1147
01:12:30,705 --> 01:12:33,290
- Some other time.
- Now.

1148
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:36,042
It's just an agreement
about some merger.

1149
01:12:36,043 --> 01:12:39,212
Merger? What's that?

1150
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:41,987
Several companies
being formed into one.

1151
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:44,236
- All Harry's?
- No.

1152
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:47,220
- Whose then?
- A few of Harry's and some others.

1153
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:50,015
French, Italian, and so on.

1154
01:12:50,016 --> 01:12:53,416
A cartel!

1155
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:55,562
- What are you talking about?
- About cartels!

1156
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:59,065
If that's what it is, I'm against
it. Paul explained me the whole thing.

1157
01:12:59,066 --> 01:13:01,043
It's perfectly all
right. Don't worry.

1158
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:03,045
- Are you sure?
- Ask Harry.

1159
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:05,047
- I will.
- He won't like it.

1160
01:13:05,072 --> 01:13:07,049
- Why not?
- Well, he just won't, that's all.

1161
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:10,202
- He doesn't like people butting in.
- I'm not people.

1162
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:12,204
Listen to me, Billie. Be smart.

1163
01:13:12,205 --> 01:13:15,184
How can I be smart if nobody
ever tells me anything?

1164
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,209
- I'm telling you something.
- What?

1165
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:19,187
Sign this stuff and
don't start up with him.

1166
01:13:19,212 --> 01:13:21,713
- Tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow?

1167
01:13:21,714 --> 01:13:23,862
I wanna look it over,
know what I'm doin'.

1168
01:13:23,883 --> 01:13:26,327
- It's all right.
- It must be somethin' fishy.

1169
01:13:26,344 --> 01:13:29,664
If not, you'd tell me.
Take my word for it.

1170
01:13:31,098 --> 01:13:33,099
No.

1171
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,101
I know what you feel bad about.

1172
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:37,082
You don't like to be
doin' all his dirty work...

1173
01:13:37,104 --> 01:13:40,941
- 'cause you know you're better than him.
- That's enough!

1174
01:13:40,942 --> 01:13:45,047
But I'm not so sure.
Maybe you're worse.

1175
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,549
Interesting?

1176
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,926
Not very.

1177
01:14:49,927 --> 01:14:52,971
I suppose you're used to
reading more high-tone stuff.

1178
01:14:52,972 --> 01:14:55,575
Yes, I am.

1179
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,998
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothin'.

1180
01:14:58,019 --> 01:15:01,313
- All of a sudden...
- I don't like that Jim.

1181
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:03,508
Why?

1182
01:15:03,524 --> 01:15:06,594
- What'd he do to ya?
- He didn't do nothin'... anything to me.

1183
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:09,988
- It's what he's done to himself.
- Done what?

1184
01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:12,824
Paul told me he could've been
assistant attorney general...

1185
01:15:12,825 --> 01:15:15,428
of the whole United States.

1186
01:15:15,453 --> 01:15:18,432
- Who?
- Jim.

1187
01:15:18,456 --> 01:15:22,208
- So what's wrong with that?
- So nothing's wrong with it.

1188
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:27,464
Look at him now. Hangs
around, helps you... promote.

1189
01:15:27,465 --> 01:15:30,550
Lets you walk over him
'cause you pay him for it.

1190
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:34,846
Oh, so we finally get around to me.

1191
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:40,310
I'm not sure I like you either.

1192
01:15:40,311 --> 01:15:42,914
You're selfish.
That's your trouble.

1193
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:46,858
- Since when is all this?
- Since now.

1194
01:15:46,859 --> 01:15:49,945
I used to think you
were a big man, Harry.

1195
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:52,530
I'm beginning to see you're not.

1196
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:55,680
All through history there's been
bigger men than you, and better.

1197
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:57,678
- Now too.
- Who, for instance?

1198
01:15:57,703 --> 01:15:59,726
- Thousands.
- Name one.

1199
01:16:00,748 --> 01:16:02,521
My father.

1200
01:16:03,501 --> 01:16:06,628
Twenty-five a week.

1201
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:09,983
Listen, cutie, don't get nervous
just 'cause you read a book.

1202
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:12,717
- You're as dumb as you ever were.
- You think so, huh?

1203
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:16,163
Yeah, but I don't
mind. You know why?

1204
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,223
- 'Cause you're the greatest...
- Oh, leave me alone!

1205
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:20,225
- Come here! I've never seen you like this!
- No!

1206
01:16:20,226 --> 01:16:22,579
I've never been like this!
I feel like I wanna go away!

1207
01:16:22,603 --> 01:16:25,303
- Where? In a couple of weeks we'll go to Florida.
- I don't know!

1208
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:28,133
- I mean alone! Maybe!
- I think you've gone nuts!

1209
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,376
- All right! Calm down!
- I can't!

1210
01:16:29,402 --> 01:16:30,944
- Why not?
- I don't know!

1211
01:16:30,945 --> 01:16:34,239
I just know I hate my life.
There's a better cut. I know it.

1212
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,242
And if you read some of these
books, you'd know it too.

1213
01:16:37,243 --> 01:16:39,744
Maybe it's right what
you say: I'm still dumb.

1214
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:41,955
But I know one thing
I never knew before.

1215
01:16:41,956 --> 01:16:44,749
There's a better kind of
life than the one I got.

1216
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,443
Or you!

1217
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,880
I suppose you'd think you'd be better
off with that lousy saxophone player?

1218
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:53,967
- At least he was honest!
- Nah, he was a dime-a-dozen chump!

1219
01:16:53,968 --> 01:16:56,094
He worked for a living!
That's one thing!

1220
01:16:56,095 --> 01:16:58,513
I've worked since I was 12!
Nobody never gave me nothin'!

1221
01:16:58,514 --> 01:17:01,182
If a man goes and robs
a house, that's work too.

1222
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,206
In my whole life...

1223
01:17:08,983 --> 01:17:11,552
In my whole life, I
never robbed a house!

1224
01:17:11,569 --> 01:17:15,113
- What are you talking about?
- You can hardly understand anything.

1225
01:17:15,114 --> 01:17:17,657
Get off that high horse,
you dumb little putt!

1226
01:17:17,658 --> 01:17:20,511
You... menace!

1227
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:24,539
I picked you up out of the
gutter! I can throw you back!

1228
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,541
You never had a decent
meal until you met me!

1229
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:28,543
Yeah, but I haven't had one
with you! You eat terrible!

1230
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:31,337
You got no manners! Taking
your shoes off all the time.

1231
01:17:31,338 --> 01:17:33,965
That's another thing,
and picking your teeth.

1232
01:17:33,966 --> 01:17:36,239
You're just not couth!

1233
01:17:43,476 --> 01:17:45,920
I'm as couth as you are!

1234
01:17:48,105 --> 01:17:50,732
And that cheap perfume
you put on yourself.

1235
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:54,554
Cheap. I don't own
nothin' cheap, except you.

1236
01:17:56,113 --> 01:17:58,114
You don't own me.

1237
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:00,325
Nobody can own anybody.
There's a law that says.

1238
01:18:00,326 --> 01:18:02,303
What do I care what the law
says! If I was scared of the law,

1239
01:18:02,328 --> 01:18:04,329
- I wouldn't be where I am!
- Where are ya?

1240
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:07,229
You talked enough! You
don't like it here, beat it!

1241
01:18:09,668 --> 01:18:11,816
Wait a minute!

1242
01:18:11,837 --> 01:18:14,065
- First, this! Right now!
- Not now! No!

1243
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,784
- Come here!
- I'm not signin' anything
till I know what I'm signin'...

1244
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:20,155
- from now on!
- Do what I'm tellin' ya!

1245
01:18:22,306 --> 01:18:24,557
- Harry, please don't!
- No!

1246
01:18:24,558 --> 01:18:26,626
No!

1247
01:18:31,232 --> 01:18:33,300
Here!

1248
01:18:47,081 --> 01:18:49,684
All right, now go on. Blow!

1249
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,544
- What?
- I don't want you bawlin'
around here. That's what!

1250
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:54,712
I've been too good to ya.
You don't appreciate nothin'!

1251
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:58,133
So go on, blow! Sit on a park
bench and learn how to behave!

1252
01:18:58,134 --> 01:19:00,157
Go on, beat it!

1253
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:06,450
This way out.

1254
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,893
- I gotta put somethin' on.
- Well, hurry it up.

1255
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:11,497
I don't want you around here
like this. You bother me!

1256
01:19:16,193 --> 01:19:19,092
Big fascist!

1257
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,762
All set?

1258
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:48,242
Certainly, all set. What do you
think? I'm gonna let a broad talk back?

1259
01:19:48,267 --> 01:19:50,894
- Where is she?
- I told her to take a walk.

1260
01:19:50,895 --> 01:19:52,872
One thing I can't stand is a crier.

1261
01:19:52,897 --> 01:19:56,001
- What's she crying about?
- How do I know?

1262
01:19:57,443 --> 01:19:59,694
- She's becoming a strange girl.
- Aw, she's all right.

1263
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:03,114
It's just all these books, they
got her nervous, that's all.

1264
01:20:03,115 --> 01:20:05,617
It looks like your passion for
educating her was a mistake.

1265
01:20:05,618 --> 01:20:07,660
I didn't know it was gonna
turn out like this, did I?

1266
01:20:07,661 --> 01:20:10,856
Remind me to fire that-that
four-eyed Verrall skunk.

1267
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,271
- Why blame him?
- He taught her too much.

1268
01:20:13,292 --> 01:20:18,046
- You know what she called me before?
- A fascist! She did?

1269
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,548
That don't make sense. I was
born in Plainfield, New Jersey.

1270
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,572
She knows that.

1271
01:20:25,304 --> 01:20:27,873
What's the matter, Harry?

1272
01:20:31,477 --> 01:20:34,000
I love that broad.

1273
01:20:35,606 --> 01:20:39,984
Hey, you think we could find
somebody to make her dumb again?

1274
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,605
And don't be late if you
don't want no bloody nose.

1275
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:57,770
Would you do me a favor, Harry?

1276
01:20:57,795 --> 01:21:00,899
- What?
- Drop dead.

1277
01:21:54,977 --> 01:22:00,023
I have sworn upon
the altar of God...

1278
01:22:00,024 --> 01:22:03,109
Eternal hostility...

1279
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:07,447
against every form of tyranny...

1280
01:22:07,448 --> 01:22:10,427
over the mind of man.

1281
01:22:26,091 --> 01:22:28,718
Oh, hello? Uh, Chestnut 7-1-8-0.

1282
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,889
I'd like to speak to
Thomas Jefferson, please.

1283
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:36,039
Oh, no. I mean, Thomas Verrall.

1284
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:40,980
No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.

1285
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:44,108
Well, it's very important.

1286
01:22:44,109 --> 01:22:47,028
Oh, well, I'll hold on.

1287
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:00,563
- Jim!
- Yes?

1288
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:02,585
- What time is it already?
- 11:30.

1289
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,563
I'll slug her senseless
when she gets back.

1290
01:23:04,588 --> 01:23:06,672
- If.
- Oh, I've had this with her before.

1291
01:23:06,673 --> 01:23:08,716
She always winds
up where I want her.

1292
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,740
I hope so.

1293
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:28,861
- Jim!
- Yes?

1294
01:23:28,862 --> 01:23:29,929
What time is it?

1295
01:23:29,947 --> 01:23:32,490
- 11:30.
- You said that before.

1296
01:23:32,491 --> 01:23:34,559
11:31.

1297
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:37,995
- She's been gone eight hours.
- Maybe she's seeing a double feature.

1298
01:23:37,996 --> 01:23:39,997
Yeah.

1299
01:23:39,998 --> 01:23:43,272
That don't take eight hours.

1300
01:23:43,293 --> 01:23:46,170
- Could've got in an accident.
- You'd hear.

1301
01:23:46,171 --> 01:23:48,319
Could've got attacked.

1302
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,675
- Happens all the time.
- Not to Billie.

1303
01:23:50,676 --> 01:23:53,428
Maybe the other way
around, but not to Billie.

1304
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:11,301
- She here?
- What do you mean, she here?

1305
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:13,698
- No! Go look some more.
- I've been all over town.

1306
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:16,052
Well, go over it again!

1307
01:24:16,076 --> 01:24:18,619
- Do what I'm tellin' ya!
- Sure.

1308
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:21,314
Just changin' my socks.

1309
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,293
- Harry.
- What?

1310
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,317
Marry her.

1311
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,574
- Still harpin', huh?
- I'm thinking of your legal safety.

1312
01:24:31,592 --> 01:24:35,178
- On paper, she owns...
- Yeah, I know what she owns.

1313
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:37,722
You've got to do it, Harry.

1314
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:40,224
They always hook you
in the end, them broads.

1315
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:42,685
This whole trouble is on
account of a dame reads a book.

1316
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:46,541
It's the new world, Harry.
Force and reason changing places.

1317
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:49,108
- What?
- Knowledge is power.

1318
01:24:49,109 --> 01:24:51,110
I don't like the way things
are goin' around here...

1319
01:24:51,111 --> 01:24:53,112
you stewed all the time
and that broad out of line.

1320
01:24:53,113 --> 01:24:55,090
And that's some fine
congressman you bought me.

1321
01:24:55,115 --> 01:24:57,992
- I think he's cute.
- Yeah, well I'd like to trade him in, no kiddin'.

1322
01:24:57,993 --> 01:25:00,244
- On what, for instance?
- For instance, on a senator.

1323
01:25:00,245 --> 01:25:02,163
On a senator.

1324
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:04,582
Take those blinders off, Harry,
and let in a little light.

1325
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,043
Just for a second.
It won't hurt much.

1326
01:25:07,044 --> 01:25:09,712
You don't go around this
town buying up senators...

1327
01:25:09,713 --> 01:25:12,256
and congressmen as if
they wore price tags.

1328
01:25:12,257 --> 01:25:16,385
These guys are honest,
sincerely trying to do a job.

1329
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:19,055
Once in a while, you find
a rotten apple, like Hedges.

1330
01:25:19,056 --> 01:25:22,099
Then you can have them,
but just once in a while,

1331
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,373
in a great while.

1332
01:25:57,803 --> 01:26:02,223
Are you sure you're ringin'
Mr. Brock's suite, Operator?

1333
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:04,809
How about the bedroom?

1334
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:07,254
Well, ring a few more
times, will ya, honey?

1335
01:26:07,271 --> 01:26:09,730
- I wanna make sure.
- He's not in.

1336
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:11,754
Just one more ring.

1337
01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:15,425
Let's go.

1338
01:26:26,498 --> 01:26:29,147
- The stuffs in his briefcase...
- Uh-huh.

1339
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:31,611
- In his bedroom.
- Uh-huh.

1340
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:37,280
- I probably won't see ya again, Paul.
- Uh-huh.

1341
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:39,529
- So I wanna say good-bye.
- What?

1342
01:26:39,553 --> 01:26:42,430
- And thanks for everything.
- Where are you going?

1343
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:44,640
Just away from here,
that's all I know.

1344
01:26:44,641 --> 01:26:47,085
Where?

1345
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:49,687
- You can tell me.
- I don't know.

1346
01:26:49,688 --> 01:26:53,543
I thought I might go see
my father for a while.

1347
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:56,527
- I've got a better idea.
- What?

1348
01:26:56,528 --> 01:26:58,596
Let's get married.

1349
01:27:00,365 --> 01:27:02,433
You must be daffy.

1350
01:27:04,036 --> 01:27:06,104
I love you, Billie.

1351
01:27:07,831 --> 01:27:11,250
You don't love me.
You just love my brain.

1352
01:27:11,251 --> 01:27:13,794
That too.

1353
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:16,339
Well, I'll think it over,
but I can tell you now...

1354
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,363
the answer's no.

1355
01:27:25,015 --> 01:27:27,433
What are you doin'?

1356
01:27:27,434 --> 01:27:29,957
Well, if you don't know,
I must be doing it wrong.

1357
01:27:45,535 --> 01:27:48,058
Fine time!

1358
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:54,877
- Hello, Harry.
- Where ya been?

1359
01:27:54,878 --> 01:27:57,004
I took a walk like you told me.

1360
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,006
I met Paul.

1361
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:01,530
Okay, buster, knock off!

1362
01:28:03,887 --> 01:28:06,097
Good night, Paul.

1363
01:28:06,098 --> 01:28:07,515
Good night, Billie.

1364
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:08,868
Good night, Harry.

1365
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:13,547
What's the matter,
Harry, ya miss me?

1366
01:28:30,414 --> 01:28:33,768
I decided somethin' to tell ya, somethin'
good. I don't like to wait when I get an idea.

1367
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,862
- Yeah, I know.
- Now that I see ya,
I'm not so sure I should tell it.

1368
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:39,505
- Why not?
- Runnin' out, talkin' fresh, slammin' doors.

1369
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:41,483
I knew you'd be back though.

1370
01:28:41,508 --> 01:28:44,157
- Ya did, huh?
- I told Jim. He was worried, not me.

1371
01:28:44,177 --> 01:28:47,998
- Not yet.
- What took ya so long?

1372
01:28:48,014 --> 01:28:50,537
- I had a lot to think.
- For instance?

1373
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:53,959
- Just where I stand around here.
- I've been tryin' to tell ya.

1374
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:55,479
- What?
- Where ya stand around here.

1375
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,315
- Uh-huh.
- First, that Verrall stuff is
out. It gets in my way.

1376
01:28:58,316 --> 01:29:00,296
I don't like to see you
upset. It's bad for you.

1377
01:29:00,318 --> 01:29:02,486
- The next thing, we're gonna be married.
- No.

1378
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:04,965
But you gotta learn how
to behave your... No?

1379
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:06,991
- What do you mean, no?
- I don't wanna.

1380
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:08,993
That's what I mean. No!

1381
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:12,163
In fact, I've never
been so insulted.

1382
01:29:12,164 --> 01:29:14,165
Who are you to say no if I tell ya?

1383
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:18,146
Don't knock yourself out. You
got a lot of surprises comin'.

1384
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:24,442
Look! Just tell me first.

1385
01:29:24,468 --> 01:29:26,677
- What?
- How can you not wanna marry me?

1386
01:29:26,678 --> 01:29:28,804
Well, for one thing,
you're too dumb.

1387
01:29:28,805 --> 01:29:32,141
I just got a different kind of
life in mind, Harry, entirely.

1388
01:29:32,142 --> 01:29:34,143
I'm sorry, but you
just wouldn't fit in.

1389
01:29:34,144 --> 01:29:36,338
Listen, Billie, I don't understand
what's happenin' around here.

1390
01:29:36,354 --> 01:29:38,814
- I do.
- What did I do? What did I?

1391
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:40,983
All right, I talk rough
to you once in a while.

1392
01:29:40,984 --> 01:29:43,944
Maybe I hit you a
couple of times... easy.

1393
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:47,198
Is that any reason
to treat me like this?

1394
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:50,519
I done good for you too.
Couldn't we straighten this out?

1395
01:29:50,535 --> 01:29:52,536
- No.
- Why not?

1396
01:29:52,537 --> 01:29:55,206
Well, all that stuff
I've been studying...

1397
01:29:55,207 --> 01:29:58,334
what Paul's been tellin'
me, it just mixed me up.

1398
01:29:58,335 --> 01:30:01,170
But when you hit me
before, it was like...

1399
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:04,924
everything knocked itself
together in my head and made sense.

1400
01:30:04,925 --> 01:30:07,676
All of the sudden I
realized what it means,

1401
01:30:07,677 --> 01:30:11,180
how some people are always
givin' and some takin'.

1402
01:30:11,181 --> 01:30:13,265
And it's not fair,

1403
01:30:13,266 --> 01:30:17,872
so I'm not gonna let ya
anymore, or anybody else.

1404
01:30:19,564 --> 01:30:23,760
Listen, kid, I got an idea.
Ya wanna come to Florida?

1405
01:30:25,237 --> 01:30:29,573
We used to have some good
times together. Remember, honey?

1406
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:32,618
I think you should
marry me, don't you?

1407
01:30:32,619 --> 01:30:34,745
Look, Billie, I want you to marry
me. I don't wanna argue about it.

1408
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:37,498
I heard enough. Do what I'm tellin'
ya or you'll be good and sorry!

1409
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:40,584
I'm not scared of ya anymore,
Harry. That's another thing.

1410
01:30:40,585 --> 01:30:42,608
Oh, you're not, huh?

1411
01:30:45,131 --> 01:30:47,825
Hit somethin' else. I'm leavin'.

1412
01:30:47,843 --> 01:30:50,386
- What?
- For good.

1413
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:52,930
Let's get organized around here!
You just can't walk out, cutie!

1414
01:30:52,931 --> 01:30:55,558
You're in this too deep! I'm in the
middle of the biggest thing I ever done!

1415
01:30:55,559 --> 01:30:57,536
Maybe I was wrong hookin'
ya in, but you're in!

1416
01:30:57,561 --> 01:30:59,755
- I'm not gonna be, I decided.
- All right, fine!

1417
01:30:59,771 --> 01:31:01,772
- You wanna wash it up?
All right, we'll wash it up.
- Yeah.

1418
01:31:01,773 --> 01:31:04,733
I'm too important to monkey
around with what you think!

1419
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:07,758
Jim! Jim, wake up!

1420
01:31:08,738 --> 01:31:11,949
- Jim!
- What is it?

1421
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:14,618
Come on! You got some work to do!

1422
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:17,162
All right. Be right with you.

1423
01:31:17,163 --> 01:31:19,766
Okay, well, get a move on!

1424
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:23,544
I'll fix it so you're
out of here in no time!

1425
01:31:23,545 --> 01:31:26,380
I spoiled ya! I was gonna
make ya real partners!

1426
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:30,301
You don't want it? Fine! Let's
see how you do without me!

1427
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:32,887
And you don't look like you looked
nine years ago. In fact, you look lousy.

1428
01:31:32,888 --> 01:31:34,889
If you want the truth, I'll
be glad to be rid of ya!

1429
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:36,867
And as far as I'm concerned,

1430
01:31:36,892 --> 01:31:40,603
- Yeah?
- "vi-ce ver-sa."

1431
01:31:40,604 --> 01:31:42,897
Oh.

1432
01:31:42,898 --> 01:31:44,750
You're back.

1433
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:45,816
- All set?
- Shut up!

1434
01:31:45,817 --> 01:31:46,901
What's the matter?

1435
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:49,801
She's goin' off! We're gonna settle
things and get her out of here!

1436
01:31:49,821 --> 01:31:52,470
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- First time in my life I do.

1437
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:54,491
- Where's that stuff you wanted her to sign?
- In your bedroom.

1438
01:31:54,492 --> 01:31:56,785
- Well, come on!
- No!

1439
01:31:56,786 --> 01:31:58,787
What do you mean, no?

1440
01:31:58,788 --> 01:32:02,875
I mean... Uh, take the
shortcut. The sooner, the better.

1441
01:32:09,841 --> 01:32:11,943
They're in the bottom drawer.

1442
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:23,296
- Blue covers?
- Yeah.

1443
01:32:24,522 --> 01:32:27,592
- Three copies?
- That's right.

1444
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:31,320
Paul took them.

1445
01:32:31,321 --> 01:32:33,322
- When?
- Just now.

1446
01:32:33,323 --> 01:32:35,616
- What for?
- What do you think for?

1447
01:32:35,617 --> 01:32:38,186
To get put in the
newspapers, I guess.

1448
01:32:38,203 --> 01:32:41,038
- Some kind of jokes I don't like.
- It's no joke.

1449
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:43,749
Paul said it's the
biggest swindle since...

1450
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:46,694
the tea pots, somethin' like that.

1451
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,214
What are you gettin'
so white about?

1452
01:32:50,215 --> 01:32:53,615
You told me yourself it
was perfectly all right.

1453
01:32:53,635 --> 01:32:56,720
- Why, you double-crossin' little...
- I don't see it like that!

1454
01:32:56,721 --> 01:33:01,308
If there's a fire and I call the
engine, so who am I double-crossin'?

1455
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:03,628
The fire?

1456
01:33:07,691 --> 01:33:09,885
We're in trouble, Harry.
If this stuff breaks,

1457
01:33:09,901 --> 01:33:11,944
- nobody will play with us.
- What's to do?

1458
01:33:11,945 --> 01:33:14,673
It might be best under the
circumstances to call it off.

1459
01:33:14,698 --> 01:33:17,408
- What?
- Let him publish. If nothing
happens, he looks silly.

1460
01:33:17,409 --> 01:33:19,410
I've been here two months! I've
spent I don't know how much dough.

1461
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:21,138
I'm supposed to let all that ride?

1462
01:33:21,162 --> 01:33:23,185
- You don't want to play it safe?
- I want what I came after!

1463
01:33:23,206 --> 01:33:26,105
- It's gonna be tough.
- Because some little weasel gets noisy?

1464
01:33:26,126 --> 01:33:28,127
- I'll cut his tongue out! You're chicken!
- Yes think so?

1465
01:33:28,128 --> 01:33:30,129
- Yes, I think so.
- You're off the handle because...

1466
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,339
it looks like I've been
right and you've been wrong!

1467
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:36,093
Shut up! I'll handle this.

1468
01:33:36,094 --> 01:33:38,162
All right.

1469
01:33:43,768 --> 01:33:45,745
Lookin' for someone?

1470
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:48,544
- Billie.
- Come on in.

1471
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:57,599
- Billie!
- Gee, I'm tired. I was down...

1472
01:33:57,615 --> 01:34:01,094
- I think you've got somethin'
by mistake belongs to me.
- That so?

1473
01:34:11,296 --> 01:34:13,364
How 'bout it?

1474
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,405
Hey.

1475
01:34:18,636 --> 01:34:20,659
Sit down.

1476
01:34:25,643 --> 01:34:27,620
- Hello.
- How you been?

1477
01:34:27,645 --> 01:34:29,622
- Fine. And you?
- Fine.

1478
01:34:29,647 --> 01:34:34,068
- Go around to his place and get the stuff.
- It's not there, Jim.

1479
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:36,092
Where then?

1480
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,929
You wanna play rough?
I know how to do that too.

1481
01:34:43,495 --> 01:34:46,747
Listen, you two heels. I make
business. I got too much at stake here.

1482
01:34:46,748 --> 01:34:48,749
You've got somethin'
that belongs to me.

1483
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,727
If you want out of here
alive, you better give it back.

1484
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:54,004
- I'm no blowhard! Tell him!
- He's no blowhard.

1485
01:34:54,005 --> 01:34:56,028
He's had people killed before.

1486
01:34:56,049 --> 01:34:58,383
- About six years ago, there was this guy...
- Shut up!

1487
01:34:58,384 --> 01:35:00,862
You ain't gonna be tellin'
nobody nothin' pretty soon.

1488
01:35:00,887 --> 01:35:05,367
- Double negative, right?
- Right.

1489
01:35:07,185 --> 01:35:09,458
You don't seem to be gettin' the
idea! You've never been in trouble...

1490
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:12,378
- like you're gonna be unless
you do what I'm tellin' ya!
- Wait a minute, Harry.

1491
01:35:12,398 --> 01:35:16,503
There's another way to handle this. I
really think you've pulled a boner, friend.

1492
01:35:16,528 --> 01:35:20,553
- My advice to you is lay off.
- And mine is stop sticking
your noses in my business.

1493
01:35:20,573 --> 01:35:23,017
- Yeah.
- Talk about stickin' noses!
You're the biggest buttinsky...

1494
01:35:23,034 --> 01:35:25,911
- I ever run into!
- Told you once before, Harry, that's my job.

1495
01:35:25,912 --> 01:35:28,831
That's why your papers are in the
U.S. mails addressed to myself.

1496
01:35:28,832 --> 01:35:30,855
You're job? What?
Gettin' in my way?

1497
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:33,877
- Well, not exactly.
- What then? I'd like to know?

1498
01:35:33,878 --> 01:35:36,755
To find out what goes on
and get it to the people.

1499
01:35:36,756 --> 01:35:39,609
- What people?
- The people.

1500
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:41,844
- I never heard of 'em.
- You will, Harry, someday.

1501
01:35:41,845 --> 01:35:45,347
They're gettin' to be more and
more well-known all the time.

1502
01:35:45,348 --> 01:35:48,247
What if I told you this whole
operation is strictly according to law?

1503
01:35:48,268 --> 01:35:51,562
- Then I'd say the law needs revision.
- Who are you, the government?

1504
01:35:51,563 --> 01:35:53,540
- Of course.
- Since when?

1505
01:35:53,565 --> 01:35:56,669
- Since 1779, right?
- Right.

1506
01:35:57,694 --> 01:36:00,195
What do you think you've got, Paul?

1507
01:36:00,196 --> 01:36:03,240
A connection between Harry's combine
and the congressman's amendment.

1508
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:05,560
All right. But why single us
out to make a fuss over it?

1509
01:36:05,577 --> 01:36:07,771
- Yeah, why?
- What we're doing isn't uncommon.

1510
01:36:07,787 --> 01:36:10,747
- It's done every day.
- Done every day, that's right.

1511
01:36:10,748 --> 01:36:13,208
For all I know, there's an
undiscovered murder committed every day.

1512
01:36:13,209 --> 01:36:16,587
And what does that prove?
All this undercover pressure.

1513
01:36:16,588 --> 01:36:20,340
This bribery, corruption,
government between friends.

1514
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:22,509
Sure, it goes on all the
time, and it's tough to crack!

1515
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,678
Just ask me. I've tried for years.

1516
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:26,763
You need more than
knowing about it.

1517
01:36:26,764 --> 01:36:30,601
You gotta have facts and figures,
and most important, the names.

1518
01:36:30,602 --> 01:36:32,978
And he's got 'em.

1519
01:36:32,979 --> 01:36:36,273
All right, let's get down to it.

1520
01:36:36,274 --> 01:36:38,251
What'll you take, Paul?

1521
01:36:38,276 --> 01:36:41,095
- I'll take a drink, please, if I may.
- Don't get fancy!

1522
01:36:41,112 --> 01:36:43,614
- I ain't met a guy yet didn't have his price!
- I have.

1523
01:36:43,615 --> 01:36:46,575
- I'm talkin' about big numbers!
- You and your big numbers!

1524
01:36:46,576 --> 01:36:49,494
You don't watch out, you'll be
wearin' one across your chest!

1525
01:36:49,495 --> 01:36:51,747
I'll get to you later!

1526
01:36:51,748 --> 01:36:54,458
Now make up your mind. There's
two ways we can do business.

1527
01:36:54,459 --> 01:36:57,002
One, you play ball, and I'll
make it worth your while.

1528
01:36:57,003 --> 01:36:59,129
Two, start watchin' your step, 'cause
there's no place you can walk...

1529
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:02,216
no place you can live
if you monkey wrench me.

1530
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:04,740
Now, what do you say?

1531
01:37:06,596 --> 01:37:10,621
- I'd like to think it over.
- All right, you got two minutes.

1532
01:37:35,041 --> 01:37:37,109
Come on, Billie.

1533
01:37:38,378 --> 01:37:40,337
- Wait a minute, Harry!
- Harry!

1534
01:37:40,338 --> 01:37:42,339
Cut it out, Harry!
Cut it out, Harry!

1535
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:45,801
- Operator! Let me go! Operator!
- Get a hold of yourself!

1536
01:37:49,055 --> 01:37:53,016
You stupid fool! What
do you think you are?

1537
01:37:53,017 --> 01:37:55,352
Can't you see that all this muscle
stuff is a thing of the past?

1538
01:37:55,353 --> 01:37:57,354
You cut it out, or you'll
be a thing of the past too!

1539
01:37:57,355 --> 01:38:01,149
- I got mad.
- Who are you to get mad, you big baboon?

1540
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:03,173
You ought to be grateful you're
allowed to walk around free.

1541
01:38:03,194 --> 01:38:05,372
You don't know me good
enough for that kind of talk.

1542
01:38:05,398 --> 01:38:09,032
I know ya. A kick in the keister, a crooked
play, and your problems are all solved.

1543
01:38:09,033 --> 01:38:11,306
Bigger problems, bigger
kicks. Who's next?

1544
01:38:11,327 --> 01:38:13,662
- The government? The nation?
- Aw, don't blow your top.

1545
01:38:13,663 --> 01:38:16,107
I'm still ready to do business.

1546
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,376
How's a hundred grand?

1547
01:38:19,377 --> 01:38:21,696
A hundred grand is beautiful.

1548
01:38:21,713 --> 01:38:24,737
- But I can't take it.
- Why not?

1549
01:38:26,384 --> 01:38:30,205
- My girl wouldn't like it, would she?
- She certainly wouldn't.

1550
01:38:30,221 --> 01:38:33,598
- All right, then! What's your idea?
- Nothing. No idea.

1551
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:37,561
I'm just trying to show you that...
legislation's not meant for buying and selling.

1552
01:38:37,562 --> 01:38:39,563
This country, with
its institutions,

1553
01:38:39,564 --> 01:38:41,565
- belongs to the people who inhibit it!
- Inhabit!

1554
01:38:41,566 --> 01:38:44,109
- Inhabit it!
- I always did what I want. I'm always gonna.

1555
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:45,402
- Try it.
- Who's gonna stop me?

1556
01:38:45,403 --> 01:38:46,653
- Us two.
- Youse two!

1557
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:48,155
Oh, don't make me split a gut.

1558
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:53,160
It's gonna be some fine day when a
100-a-week hick and a dumb broad can stop me.

1559
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:56,231
What are you standin' around like a
thief and dummy? What do I pay you for?

1560
01:38:56,247 --> 01:38:58,896
- Say somethin'!
- All right, I'll say something.

1561
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:01,251
- Well?
- They're right.

1562
01:39:01,252 --> 01:39:04,212
Whose side are you on?

1563
01:39:04,213 --> 01:39:05,756
- What do you want?
- Rye, ginger ale.

1564
01:39:05,757 --> 01:39:07,049
Who asked you? Butt out!

1565
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:10,302
Tell that congressman of yours
he's all washed up. I guarantee it.

1566
01:39:10,303 --> 01:39:12,971
As far as you're concerned, you're
not gonna get away with it either.

1567
01:39:12,972 --> 01:39:15,515
- Don't worry about me.
- Oh, but I do.

1568
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:18,643
I worry like the devil.
I stay up nights.

1569
01:39:18,644 --> 01:39:21,772
You know, when you live in Washington,
it's enough to break your heart.

1570
01:39:21,773 --> 01:39:25,192
You see a perfect piece of
machinery... the democratic structure...

1571
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:28,487
and somebody's always tampering with
it, trying to make it hit the jackpot.

1572
01:39:28,488 --> 01:39:32,764
When you steal from the government,
you're stealin' from yourself, ya dumb ox!

1573
01:39:32,784 --> 01:39:35,202
- You two, go ahead. I'm goin' right ahead.
- Wait a minute.

1574
01:39:35,203 --> 01:39:37,204
- I'll tell you where you're goin'.
- You?

1575
01:39:37,205 --> 01:39:41,958
Sure. In this whole thing, I guess you
forgot about me... about how I'm a partner.

1576
01:39:41,959 --> 01:39:46,421
Jim once told me... 126
different yards I own.

1577
01:39:46,422 --> 01:39:49,299
- Control.
- Same thing.

1578
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:51,301
So here's how it's gonna be.
I don't want 'em.

1579
01:39:51,302 --> 01:39:54,451
I don't want anything of yours or to do
with you, so I'm gonna sign 'em all back.

1580
01:39:54,472 --> 01:39:56,456
- All right.
- Only not all at once.

1581
01:39:56,482 --> 01:39:59,935
Just one at a time. One a year.

1582
01:40:00,436 --> 01:40:03,146
Only you gotta behave,
'cause if you don't...

1583
01:40:03,147 --> 01:40:05,315
I could let go on everything.

1584
01:40:05,316 --> 01:40:08,402
For what you've done, even
since I've known you...

1585
01:40:08,403 --> 01:40:12,823
I bet you could be put in
jail for about 900 years.

1586
01:40:12,824 --> 01:40:15,518
You'd be a pretty old
man when you got out.

1587
01:40:16,869 --> 01:40:20,163
- What's goin' on around here?
- A revolution.

1588
01:40:20,164 --> 01:40:23,208
Come on, Paul. I'll
send for my things.

1589
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:26,002
You little crumb! You'll
be sorry for this day.

1590
01:40:26,003 --> 01:40:29,297
Just wait and see. Go ahead and go
with him, but you don't stand a chance.

1591
01:40:29,298 --> 01:40:31,400
If I've ever seen anybody
outsmart themselves, it's you.

1592
01:40:31,426 --> 01:40:33,427
- Good-bye, all.
- And you!

1593
01:40:33,428 --> 01:40:35,637
- Me?
- Yeah! You're fired.

1594
01:40:35,638 --> 01:40:38,958
Sorry, Harry.
I enjoyed working for you.

1595
01:40:40,143 --> 01:40:42,120
Open up.

1596
01:40:42,145 --> 01:40:45,465
- All right, Harry?
- Do what I'm tellin' you!

1597
01:40:57,743 --> 01:41:00,287
How do you like that?

1598
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,437
He could've had 100 grand.
She could've had me.

1599
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:05,584
- Both wind up with nothin'.
- Mm-hmm.

1600
01:41:05,585 --> 01:41:07,586
Dumb chump.

1601
01:41:07,587 --> 01:41:09,588
Crazy broad.

1602
01:41:09,589 --> 01:41:13,049
To all the dumb chumps
and all the crazy broads...

1603
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:15,218
past, present and future...

1604
01:41:15,219 --> 01:41:18,555
who thirst for knowledge
and search for truth;

1605
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:23,018
who fight for justice
and civilize each other...

1606
01:41:23,019 --> 01:41:27,063
and make it so tough
for crooks like you...

1607
01:41:27,064 --> 01:41:29,087
and me.

1608
01:41:38,075 --> 01:41:40,724
License, please.

1609
01:41:43,581 --> 01:41:46,249
- No, not this license.
- Oh, sorry.

1610
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:48,728
Okay, forget it. My wedding
present. But take it easy...

1611
01:41:48,753 --> 01:41:51,379
- or you'll never make it. Oh, don't worry.
- We'll make it.

1612
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,404
It's a clear case
of predestination.

1613
01:41:54,425 --> 01:41:57,950
- "Pre"... what?
- Look it up.
