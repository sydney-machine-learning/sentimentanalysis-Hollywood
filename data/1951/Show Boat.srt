Hey, the show boat's coming.

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,071
Come on, mule. Git!

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,670
Show boat. Show boat.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,833
Here comes the show boat.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,672
Show boat.

10
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,716
<i>See the show boat</i>

11
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,555
<i>It's old Captain Andy's</i> Cotton Blossom
<i>Will you go?</i>

12
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,758
<i>Are you coming to the show?</i>

13
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,559
<i>'Twill be delightful</i>

14
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,508
<i>And quite rightfully we say</i>
<i>There's not a better show</i>

15
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,797
<i>From New Orleans to St. Jo</i>

16
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,390
<i>Captain Andy has gathered a troupe</i>
<i>In the greatest of dramas</i>

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,235
<i>Thrills and laughter, concert after</i>
<i>Everybody's sure to go</i>

22
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,709
<i>Leave the lumber in the sawmills</i>
<i>Leave the cotton on the stalks</i>

<i>Captain Andy Hawks</i>

25
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,674
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is with exhilarating gratification...

26
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,877
...that I bring once again
my theatrical offering...

27
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,918
...to your fair community.

28
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,955
I want you to meet
some of the greatest artists...

29
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,951
...that ever played the river towns.

30
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,829
Miss Ellie May Shipley!

31
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,436
The toast of Cairo, Illinois.

32
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,316
Next, I want y'all
to meet Frank Schultz!

33
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,350
Mr. Schultz is the villain in our play.

34
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,395
But off-stage he wouldn't hurt a fly.

35
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,878
And he's stuck on Ellie.

36
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,188
That's the way they always are, folks.
Just one big happy family.

37
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,397
And I'm their father.

38
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,677
And Parthy here is their mother.

39
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,630
I worked in a new one, didn't I? We're
the parents of one big happy family.

40
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,917
You're a big bellowing catfish.
Now get these handbills started.

41
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,277
Now I want you to meet the
little sweetheart of the South.

42
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,237
Our songstress and leading lady...

43
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,278
...Miss Julie LaVerne!

44
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,433
Hiya, Miss Julie!
She gets prettier every year.

45
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,838
Just to know her
is to love her, folks.

46
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,759
Here, I want you to know
the handsomest leading man...

47
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,789
...in the Middle West.
The famous Mr. Stephen Baker!

48
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,874
A sample of
soul-stirring emotion, folks.

49
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,114
No, Hamilton, I cannot accept you,
for I am not worthy of your noble desires.

50
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,794
On my mother's name, tell me why.

51
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,077
Look into this room and
view the secret of my downfall.

52
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,872
Have to see the play tonight,
folks, to learn her secret.

53
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,079
<i>Tempest and Sunshine.</i>
Beautiful drama of tears and laughter.

54
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,437
And then after that,
the grand concert.

55
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,673
Songs and dances beyond description.

56
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,037
Frank and Ellie, just a sample.

57
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,518
Just a sample, folks.

58
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,479
More! More!

59
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,156
Frank and Ellie. Frank and Ellie.
Just a little bit more.

60
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,559
Are you in business for your health?

61
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,711
Get finished and
get these things started.

62
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,553
Go on. Take them. Go on.

63
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,517
Stephen, my boy. Pass those out
among the adoring young ladies.

64
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,669
All right, captain.

65
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,838
Hey, where'd you get that?
Stole it, huh?

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,433
I ain't stole nothing.

67
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,070
Miss Julie give it to me
out of the kindness of her big heart.

68
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,234
- What's the idea of giving my present...?
- Get away.

69
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,236
Something you don't understand,
zebra gal.

70
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,038
I told you. Stay away from my wife.

71
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,872
She's nothing but a...

72
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,672
Here. Frank, take him aboard.

73
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,557
Well, folks, I guess
we fooled you that time.

74
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,230
The boys just played you another
little scene from one of our shows.

75
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,509
Well, folks, don't forget tonight.

76
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,875
Lucky puncher.

77
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,230
Yes, sir, get your tickets now.
Beautiful songs, beautiful people.

78
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,719
Come along, everybody.

79
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,599
Please, Mr. Pete, don't get
yourself all riled up over it.

80
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,877
Mr. Steve and Miss Julie,
they got to play performances here.

81
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,553
Yeah? I know a thing or two.

82
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,030
We'll see how many performances
they play in this town.

83
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,631
Hey, where's the sheriff?

84
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,756
Down there.

85
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,439
Nineteen.

86
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,874
Stud.

87
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,679
That's over $2000 you've lost.
You're unlucky.

88
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,479
Only a temporary condition,
I assure you.

89
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,790
Here's a boat ticket to
New Orleans. Playable?

90
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,315
Suits me. Leave you sort
of stranded, won't it?

91
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,673
You are presupposing
a calamity, sir?

92
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,197
- I'll stand.
- Say 18.

93
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,557
You presupposed perfectly.

94
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,274
- Sorry.
- Good day.

95
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,712
A lot of water down there, eh, boy?

96
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,148
Yes, sir. From where he all come?

97
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,153
Same place it's going, son.

98
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,798
'Tis, huh?

99
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,876
<i>Who cares if my boat goes upstream?</i>

100
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,316
<i>Or if the gale bids me go</i>

101
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,598
<i>With the river's flow</i>

102
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,116
<i>I drift along with my fancy</i>

103
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,789
<i>Sometimes I thank my lucky stars</i>
<i>My heart is free</i>

104
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,151
<i>And other times I wonder</i>

105
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,236
<i>Where's the mate for me?</i>

106
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,312
Ticket for tonight, mister?

107
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,278
Possibly. Does this boat
go to New Orleans?

108
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,112
Yep. Winds up there.

109
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,032
I'd like to speak to the owner.

110
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,350
They're all in town
giving the street concert.

111
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,476
I'll wait for them.

112
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,911
<i>The driftwood floating over the sea</i>

113
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,358
<i>Someday finds a sheltering lea</i>

114
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,548
<i>So somewhere there surely must be</i>

115
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,556
<i>A harbor meant for me</i>

116
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,999
<i>I drift along with my fancy</i>

117
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,632
<i>Sometimes I thank my lucky stars</i>

118
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,716
<i>My heart is free</i>

119
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,433
<i>And other times I wonder</i>

120
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,716
<i>Where's the mate...?</i>

121
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,479
Is there no mercy in your evil soul?
No kindness in your ugly heart?

122
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,952
Oh, sir, what manner
of foul jackal are you?

123
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,953
Coming into our humble home,
rich as you are...

124
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,157
...yet reeking of the carrion
of the fleshpots?

125
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,838
Oh, sir, I plead with you
on bended knee...

126
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,313
...from the torn and wretched heart
of a mother.

127
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,274
Stop giving my little daughter
diamonds and go home to your wife.

128
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,237
Bravo. Bravo. Now that's just
what the scoundrel needs.

129
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,631
Yes. Is there anything
I can do for you?

130
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,836
More of the same. Magnificent.

131
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,274
Well...

132
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,151
I'm afraid I just can't.
You see, I'm...

133
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,038
I really should be airing these
clothes. Brushed and aired.

134
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,316
Isn't that menial work
for a leading lady?

135
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,391
Oh, but I'm not the leading lady.

136
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,233
You're not? That's hard to believe.
You certainly look it.

137
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,311
I'm not even a member
of the company.

138
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,473
- No?
- No. Well, I mean, not professionally.

139
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,359
I'd say that's a desire
that your heart is set on.

140
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,873
At least you're right there.

141
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,474
- Why do you want to be an actress?
- Why?

142
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,959
Well...

143
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,192
Well, the ordinary person
wouldn't understand.

144
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,033
I mean... That is, a person
outside the profession.

145
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,112
No? Well...

146
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,115
You want to be an actress
because it makes everything come true.

147
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,589
Every exciting thing
you've ever dreamed about.

148
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,671
Even if it's make-believe.
Isn't that it?

149
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,990
Yes, that is it. How did you know?

150
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,958
For instance, right now,
we could be Romeo and Juliet...

151
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,553
...or Elizabeth and Essex, or...

152
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,392
Or Lady Southwaite
and Hamilton Barsdale.

153
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,472
Or Lady Southwaite... Who?

154
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,756
Oh, they're in the
<i>Tempest and Sunshine.</i>

155
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,309
Oh, yes, of course.

156
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,195
As a matter of fact, we couldn't be
anybody talking like this.

157
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,793
We haven't been properly introduced.

158
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,033
Well, that makes no difference
in make-believe.

159
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,869
Well, I suppose that's true.

160
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,351
So we could make-believe that
we've just fallen in love at first sight.

161
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,519
<i>Only make-believe I love you</i>

162
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,916
<i>Only make-believe that you love me</i>

163
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,792
<i>Others find peace of mind</i>
<i>In pretending</i>

164
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:22,155
<i>Couldn 't you, couldn 't I, couldn 't we?</i>

165
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,632
<i>Make-believe our lips</i>

166
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,236
<i>Are blending</i>

167
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:38,354
<i>In a phantom kiss</i>
<i>Or two or three</i>

168
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,191
<i>Might as well make-believe</i>

169
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,672
<i>I love you</i>

170
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,435
<i>For to tell the truth</i>

171
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,239
<i>I do</i>

172
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:10,429
<i>The game of just supposing</i>
<i>Is the sweetest game I know</i>

173
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,070
<i>Our dreams are more romantic</i>

174
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,357
<i>Than the world we see</i>

175
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,829
<i>And if the things we dream about</i>
<i>Don 't happen to be so</i>

176
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,677
<i>That's just an unimportant technicality</i>

177
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,279
<i>Though the cold and brutal fact is</i>

178
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,592
<i>You and I have never met</i>

179
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>We need not mind conventions</i>
<i>P's and Q's</i>

180
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,999
<i>If we put our thoughts in practice</i>

181
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,076
<i>We can banish all regrets</i>

182
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,709
<i>Imagining most anything</i>

183
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,872
<i>We choose</i>

184
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,230
<i>We could make-believe</i>

185
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,870
<i>I love you</i>

186
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,510
<i>Only make-believe</i>

187
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,429
<i>That you love me</i>

188
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,473
<i>Others find peace of mind</i>
<i>In pretending</i>

189
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,677
<i>Couldn 't you?</i>

190
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,510
<i>Couldn 't I?</i>

191
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,679
<i>Couldn 't we?</i>

192
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,510
<i>Make-believe our lips</i>

193
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,070
<i>Are blending</i>

194
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,750
<i>In a phantom kiss</i>

195
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,913
<i>Or two or three</i>

196
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,790
<i>- Might as well make-believe</i>
<i>- Might as well make-believe</i>

197
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:15,193
<i>- I love you</i>
<i>- I love you</i>

198
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,914
<i>- For to tell the truth</i>
<i>- For to tell the truth</i>

199
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:35,559
<i>- I do</i>
<i>- I do</i>

200
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,190
All right, everybody,
hang up your costumes.

201
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,998
There's my father and mother.

202
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,549
Just the parties I wish to see.

203
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,631
To our next meeting.

204
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,394
And soon.

205
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,110
Captain and Mrs. Hawks, allow me.

206
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,431
Ravenal. Gaylord Ravenal
of the Tennessee Ravenals.

207
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,079
You're heading
for New Orleans?

208
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,038
- That's right, sir.
- We don't carry passengers, young man.

209
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,476
Naturally. But I'm an actor.
And I thought possibly there might be...

210
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,710
...an opening in your company
for my services.

211
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,393
I don't have my notices here...

212
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,120
Sorry, Mr. Ravenal, we're full up.

213
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,953
Troupe's been with me
all season, just doing fine.

214
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,510
I'm sorry, because I guess you cut
quite a figure before the footlights.

215
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,196
It doesn't seem to be my day.
My thanks just the same, sir.

216
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,191
Magnolia? Magnolia.
Come help Queenie with these stores.

217
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,999
- Yes, Mama.
- Hawks.

218
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,594
Yes, Parthenia.

219
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,196
I've got to do it, Julie.
I've got to split his thick skull.

220
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,271
No, darling. It's all over now.
Let it lie.

221
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,309
- We can't risk any trouble in this town.
- But the scurvy, slimy...

222
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,831
There's still not enough room
on this boat for the two of us.

223
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,038
Come in.

224
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,919
I stole a banana for him and l...

225
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,750
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, give it to him.

226
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,912
You can't spoil him any more
than you have already.

227
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,956
- Where to, Sir Lancelot?
- Get a cup of coffee.

228
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,631
Gonna be a good boy?

229
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,791
Sure. If that's what you want.

230
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,878
That rattle-brained mule.

231
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,990
Oh, golly, but he loves you.

232
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,869
Of course he does.
I'm the belle of the ball.

233
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,235
You know, I think it's wonderful.

234
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,995
Well, tell me about
your handsome stranger.

235
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,631
I saw you talking to him.
That's what you came in for, isn't it?

236
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,157
I asked Papa about him.
He said he's an actor looking for work.

237
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,598
- An actor? Your ma would love that.
- But, Julie, he's so different.

238
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,433
River dandies are
thick as locusts, angel.

239
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,398
Oh, I know. Oh, I know about men.

240
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,677
I've had them look at me,
and, you know, flirt and all.

241
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,836
But when he stood there
by the window and smiled...

242
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,151
Pulses began to pound
right here, huh?

243
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,518
Why do you love Steve so much?
The way you were just now, for instance.

244
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,274
Oh, Steve. I love him because...

245
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,919
Well, I don't know.

246
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,469
He's not a very good actor on-stage.

247
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,279
You know, he's not a very good actor
off-stage either.

248
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,079
But he's all mine.

249
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,268
And sometimes,
his eyes are like a little boy's.

250
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,228
There. Could you ever think
of loving anyone else?

251
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,268
<i>Oh, listen, sister</i>

252
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,356
<i>I love my own Mister Man</i>

253
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,674
<i>And I can 't tell you why</i>

254
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,549
<i>There ain 't no reason</i>

255
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,956
<i>For me to love that man</i>

256
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,955
<i>It must be something</i>

257
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:59,279
<i>That the angels done plan</i>

258
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,031
<i>Fish gotta swim</i>

259
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,715
<i>Birds gotta fly</i>

260
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,036
<i>I gotta love one man till I die</i>

261
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:26,553
<i>Can 't help</i>
<i>Lovin ' that man of mine</i>

262
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,434
<i>Tell me he's lazy</i>

263
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,593
<i>Tell me he's slow</i>

264
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,192
<i>Tell me I'm crazy</i>

265
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,592
<i>Maybe I know</i>

266
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:58,435
<i>Can 't help</i>
<i>Lovin ' that man of mine</i>

267
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,029
<i>When he goes away</i>

268
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,877
<i>That's a rainy day</i>

269
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,794
<i>But when he comes back</i>

270
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:26,470
<i>That day is fine</i>

271
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:37,832
<i>The sun will shine</i>

272
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,836
<i>He can come home</i>

273
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,155
<i>As late as can be</i>

274
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,598
<i>Home without him</i>

275
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:01,359
<i>Ain 't no home to me</i>

276
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,595
<i>Can 't help</i>

277
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:19,353
<i>Lovin ' that man of mine</i>

278
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,992
Oh, Julie, that's wonderful.
I could feel that way too.

279
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,628
I'll bet you will some day.

280
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,592
<i>- Fish gotta swim</i>
- Birds gotta fly.

281
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,239
- <i>Birds gotta fly</i>
- I gotta love.

282
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,437
<i>I gotta love</i>
<i>One man till I die</i>

283
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,272
<i>Can 't help</i>
<i>Lovin ' that man of mine</i>

284
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,874
Down on the levee
the gals put a little shuffle in it.

285
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:05,234
<i>Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow</i>
<i>Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know</i>

286
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,872
<i>Can 't help</i>
<i>Lovin ' that man of mine</i>

287
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,114
Now watch this one, honey.

288
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,191
<i>- That's a rainy day</i>
- Yeah, that's right.

289
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,558
<i>But when he comes back</i>
<i>That day is fine</i>

290
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,711
<i>The sun will shine</i>

291
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,350
<i>He can come home</i>
<i>As late as can be</i>

292
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,273
<i>Home without him</i>
<i>Ain 't no home to me</i>

293
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,035
<i>Can 't help</i>
<i>Lovin ' that man of...</i>

294
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,915
I thought you were gonna
help Queenie with supper.

295
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,832
I will, Mama, I will.

296
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,958
Well, that's how it is, angel.

297
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,870
From now on, you have
nothing to do with her.

298
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,840
- But, Ma, Julie's my friend.
- That stops right now.

299
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,274
But she's sweet and kind...

300
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,829
It's plain to me what's happening
onboard this boat.

301
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,390
And I'll not have my daughter mixed up
with any hussy who allows herself...

302
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,552
Mama, I'll not listen
to another word against Julie!

303
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,790
<i>Little girl, you are safe with me</i>
<i>I can protect what's mine</i>

304
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,670
<i>I am a sturdy maple tree</i>
<i>And you're my clinging vine</i>

305
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,470
<i>Woods are just full of maple trees</i>
<i>Cedar and oak and pine</i>

306
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,790
<i>Let me look them over, please</i>

307
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,559
<i>And then I'll let you know</i>
<i>If you have a show</i>

308
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,514
<i>After I have looked around the world</i>
<i>For a mate</i>

309
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,595
<i>Then, perhaps</i>
<i>I might fall back on you</i>

310
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,788
<i>When I am convinced that there is</i>
<i>No better fate</i>

311
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,909
<i>Then I might decide that you will do</i>

312
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,949
<i>I am just an average lad</i>
<i>Though no gift to womanhood</i>

313
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,554
<i>Some girls say I'm not so bad</i>

314
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,474
<i>Others say you're not so good</i>

315
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,714
<i>But if you are patient, dear</i>
<i>And willing to wait</i>

316
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,589
<i>There's a chance</i>
<i>I might fall back on you</i>

317
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,319
Hawks. Come here.

318
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,149
Hawks. Come here.

319
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,919
What is it?

320
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,196
I knew there'd be trouble with her.

321
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,955
Trouble? With who? With Julie?

322
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,428
Steve. Steve, wait a minute.
What happened?

323
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,717
- Well, what is it?
- It's Pete, with the sheriff, captain.

324
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,678
The sheriff?
But our license is paid for.

325
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,838
We heard them talking
something about Miss Julie.

326
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,235
The sheriff's gonna arrest Miss Julie.

327
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,989
Arrest Julie? But, Papa,
Julie's done nothing wrong.

328
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,151
Here, honey.

329
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,231
It won't hurt much.

330
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,069
Right in here, sheriff.

331
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,232
Hi, Windy.

332
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,278
Captain Hawks, I got some
unpleasant news for you.

333
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,271
You got a miscegenation case aboard.

334
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,112
Why, why... I don't know what...

335
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,875
You know what I mean. A case of a
Negro woman married to a white man.

336
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,629
Criminal offense in this state.
Name of the white man is Steve Baker.

337
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,274
Name of the Negress, Julie LaVerne,
born Julie Dozier.

338
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,670
- Julie!
- Julie, the record says you were born...

339
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,118
...in this county. Your pa was white
and your ma black? That right?

340
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,271
Yes, that's right.

341
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,749
You two better get your things.

342
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,673
You wouldn't call a man white
that's got Negro blood in him?

343
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,718
No. One drop of black blood
makes you black in these parts.

344
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,599
Well, I got more than a drop in me.
Hear that.

345
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,876
You'll swear to that in a court of law?

346
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,713
Anyplace. Ask any one
of these folks here.

347
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,872
Every one can swear that I've got
Negro blood in me this minute.

348
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,470
But how come this man who's been
traveling with you comes and tells me...?

349
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,552
I'll tell you why. Because
he's a no-account river rat...

350
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,518
...who's bothering Julie,
and she had nothing to do with him.

351
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,956
- He's mean and he's ugly, that's why.
- Magnolia!

352
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,237
She's right, sheriff.
My daughter's telling the truth.

353
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,550
We all can swear to it.

354
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,917
You're fired.
Get on the wharf and wait for your pay.

355
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,868
- I was only doing my duty.
- Get off this vessel.

356
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,511
Take over, Julie, we're tuckered.

357
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,592
- We want Julie. Julie LaVerne.
- Julie.

358
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,752
Look, sheriff.
Can't she go on, just once more?

359
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,433
But...

360
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,751
- Look, it's the last number.
- No, captain. I can't be responsible...

361
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,229
...for the safety of this community
if word gets out.

362
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,477
Now, you better close
the show, right now.

363
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,518
We'll pack up and get out
of here first thing in the morning.

364
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,511
- Come on, Julie.
- Julie.

365
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,478
- Where's our Julie LaVerne?
- We want Julie LaVerne.

366
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,437
Julie.

367
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,671
Be sailing soon?

368
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,308
Yes. Just as soon as...

369
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,156
Julie, I...

370
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,392
- Your ma wouldn't like this.
- She's asleep.

371
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,551
Julie, I had to.

372
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,834
I didn't have any wrapping.

373
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,434
I made it into a pincushion.

374
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,795
It was for Christmas.

375
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,478
Julie, nothing's changed.

376
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,632
Nolie, Nolie, always true.

377
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,868
You'll write to me.
Let me know how things go.

378
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,754
I'll never forget my Nolie.

379
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,791
Stay happy, now.

380
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,951
Julie.

381
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,351
Julie!

382
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,992
- Need any money?
- No, thanks.

383
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,871
Goodbye, Steve.

384
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,791
No, I said we didn't.

385
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,155
Pride is smaller than kindness.

386
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,311
Thanks, Julie.

387
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,311
Captain Andy.

388
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,748
- Mr. Steve, I wants to say l...
- Goodbye.

389
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,471
Well, ride the river, Joe.

390
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,438
- Miss Julie.
- Keep riding the old river, Joe, boy.

391
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,989
Miss Julie, I wish I could...

392
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:29,438
<i>There's an ol' man called the Mississippi</i>

393
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:39,318
<i>That's the ol' man that I wants to be</i>

394
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,313
<i>What does he care</i>

395
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,999
<i>If the world's got troubles?</i>

396
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,872
<i>What does he care</i>

397
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:04,188
<i>If the land ain 't free?</i>

398
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,150
<i>OI' man river</i>

399
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,314
<i>That ol' man river</i>

400
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,679
<i>He must know something</i>

401
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,834
<i>But don 't say nothing</i>

402
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,313
<i>He just keeps rollin '</i>

403
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,637
<i>He keeps on rollin ' along</i>

404
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,918
<i>He don 't plant 'taters</i>

405
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,198
<i>He don 't plant cotton</i>

406
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,909
<i>And them that plants them</i>

407
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,632
<i>Is soon forgotten</i>

408
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,669
<i>But ol' man river</i>

409
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:19,428
<i>He just keeps rollin ' along</i>

410
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,112
<i>You and me, we sweat and strain</i>

411
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,115
<i>Body all achin ' and racked with pain</i>

412
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,555
<i>Tote that barge</i>

413
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,837
<i>And lift that bale</i>

414
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,958
<i>Get a little drunk</i>

415
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:54,438
<i>And you lands in jail</i>

416
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,751
<i>I get weary</i>

417
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,596
<i>And sick of tryin '</i>

418
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,117
<i>I'm tired of livin '</i>

419
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,593
<i>And scared of dyin '</i>

420
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,357

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,995
<i>He just keeps rollin '</i>

422
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:43,750
<i>Along</i>

423
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,149
Joe, cast off.

424
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,874
Windy, set your helm.

425
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,708
All right, boys, stand by
with the plank. Cast off!

426
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,793
<i>Don 't plant 'taters</i>

427
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,398
<i>He don 't plant cotton</i>
<i>And them...</i>

428
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,348
Captain Andy. I just heard the news.
May I be of service to you, sir?

429
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,274
Yes. Yes, come aboard, young fellow.
Step lively.

430
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,714
Thank you.

431
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,873
<i>But ol' man river</i>

432
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,799

<i>Along</i>

446
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,355
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning, Captain Andy.

447
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,715
Good to see everybody
so chipper this morning.

448
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,314
That's the spirit.
High wind or high water...

449
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,913
...the show must go on.

450
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,116
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, Papa.

451
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,590
Fine talk. But with capacity business
waiting at Boonville tonight...

452
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,513
...who are we gonna get
for a leading man? Answer me that.

453
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,708
Patience, Parthy, patience. Didn't know
I used to have a magic act, did you?

454
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gaylord Ravenal.

455
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,031
The new leading man
of the <i>Cotton Blossom</i> Troupe...

456
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,590
...and coming idol of the river,
or I don't know my business. Which I do.

457
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,870
Thank you, Captain Andy.

458
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,270
Ladies and gentlemen...

459
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,796
...it is an honor.
- You've met my wife, I believe.

460
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,993
- A repeated pleasure, Mrs. Hawks.
- And my daughter, Magnolia?

461
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,318
Only in make-believe.

462
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,479
All right, magician. Who are we
gonna get for a leading lady?

463
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,358
Your daughter.

464
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,794
- What are you talk...?
- Papa.

465
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,599
Listen, we can't get
no leading lady till New Orleans.

466
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,354
Don't wanna give up
all that box office, like you said.

467
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,677
Yes, Mama. All that cotton-crop money
just fresh from being counted.

468
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,432
That's a lot to turn down.

469
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,275
Well, I still mean to say, I don't
wanna go against principle. But...

470
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,831
- Just until New Orleans, at least.
- Oh, please, Mama.

471
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,429
Well, go on.

472
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,551
How wonderful.

473
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,517
Miss Hawks.

474
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,795
I see. And then I embrace her.
Is that correct?

475
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,556
That's right. Now, let's take
it again, clean through.

476
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,155
Yes, Lady Southwaite,
even though I know...

477
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,632
Nolie, remember your smile,
your sweet smile here.

478
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,792
- That'll always get them.
- Yes, Papa.

479
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,637
Yes, Lady Southwaite,
even though I know your secret...

480
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,633
...the child is one to which I should
like to give my name.

481
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,150
Will you marry me?

482
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,912
Oh, Hamilton, my own.

483
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,756
Just a minute, young man.
We won't have that.

484
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,275
We'll have none of your tricks
on or off the stage.

485
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,635
But, Parthy, I thought
that was kind of natural.

486
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,110
Nature isn't necessary in play-acting,
Hawks. Especially that kind.

487
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,990
Play-acting is just make-believe.

488
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,553
Now. Now, hold her for a split second.

489
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,553
- I see.
- With no kissing.

490
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,473
- No kissing.
- And then, stand apart.

491
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,358
- Then I stand apart.
- At arm's length.

492
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,988
- Oh, at arm's length.
- Yes. You understand?

493
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,355
- Yes, ma'am.
- Very well, then.

494
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,354
Well, maybe.
Still don't make no difference.

495
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,080
Take it from me, I got a sixth sense
about these things.

496
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,629
- You two are going over like floodwater.
- Sure are.

497
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,998
Magnolia Hawks and Gaylord Ravenal
are gonna be the hit of the river!

498
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,359
But hit or not, remember now,
no nonsense. It's just make-believe.

499
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,315
What's the meaning of this?

500
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,358
- Mama, Gay and l...
- Get yourself ashore, Mr. Ravenal.

501
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,512
Sir. Ma'am, I'm asking
Nolie to be my wife.

502
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,274
You? A no-account river gambler?
How dare you.

503
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,557
Gambler, yes, but hardly no account.
You know, Captain Andy...

504
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,110
...it's dead waste to stay cooped up
here in this penny-ante existence.

505
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,192
Nolie's meant for the life
and happiness of the world.

506
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,957
I love her.

507
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,072
And by heavens,
I'm gonna see that she gets them.

508
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,515
And you, standing there...

509
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,389
...are you proud and happy, looking
forward to a life with such as him?

510
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,870
Yes, Mama, I am.

511
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,477
Then that's a sight
I never want to see again.

512
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,875
Oh, Mama.

513
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,073
Bless you, darling.

514
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,869
I love you always,
no matter what you decide.

515
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,074
Son, I hope it's not just Saturday night
with a cold Monday morning to follow.

516
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,110
Whatever happens, Nolie,
always remember to smile.

517
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,633
Are you still sure?
Still sure this is what you want?

518
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,678
Maybe you are taking a 100-1 chance.

519
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,678
I want you more than
anything in the world.

520
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,149
Mrs. Gaylord Ravenal.

521
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:43,108
<i>You are love</i>

522
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,716
<i>Here in my arms</i>

523
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,271
<i>Where you belong</i>

524
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,719
<i>And here you will stay</i>

525
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,839
<i>I'll not let you away</i>

526
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:12,195
<i>I want day after day with you</i>

527
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:21,075
<i>You are spring</i>

528
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:29,238
<i>Bud of romance unfurled</i>

529
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,953
<i>You taught me to see</i>

530
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:46,030
<i>One truth forever true</i>

531
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:55,871
<i>- You are love</i>
<i>- You are love</i>

532
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:05,233
<i>- Wonder of all the world</i>
<i>- Wonder of all the world</i>

533
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:13,034
<i>- Where you go with me</i>
<i>- Where you go with me</i>

534
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:27,673
<i>- Heaven will always be</i>
<i>- Heaven will always be</i>

535
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,832
- Mr. Ravenal. Is your team laid up?
- Yes?

536
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,230
- Well...
- No, had to sell them. Doctor's orders.

537
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,790
Mr. Ravenal will have to do a lot more
walking from now on.

538
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,070
- Key, please.
- Mr. Ravenal.

539
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,710
- Yes?
- Your account is six weeks overdue.

540
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,836
I'd like to have immediate payment.

541
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,560
Well, isn't that rather
a brusque way to inform us...

542
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,429
That's right.
But by tomorrow night, or...

543
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,593
We'll have our bill ready at that time.
Come, darling.

544
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,954
Sorry. Next car, please.

545
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,193
I suppose this sounds
very dramatic...

546
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,193
...but they are all yours.

547
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,831
Very dramatic.

548
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,595
Stop giving me your diamonds, madam,
and go home to your husband's arms.

549
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,718
- Will you listen to me?
- Even though I reek of the fleshpots...

550
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,394
...even though I cannot
kiss the hem of your gown.

551
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,199
- I won't have you...
- Though I am unworthy as they say...

552
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,557
...I still have my pride,
madam, me pride.

553
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,359
Gay, will you be sensible for once?

554
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,791
Come here, you.

555
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,999
- You love me?
- Yes, but I still...

556
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,038
I don't want your pretties, angel.
I don't need them.

557
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,919
Now, you wait. I'm a lucky boy.

558
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,674
Having you is proof enough, isn't it?

559
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,674
I'll get another stake,
and we'll be walking on tall air again.

560
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,515
- You trust me?
- Always.

561
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,229
Just don't stop loving me, huh?

562
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,996
If I ever catch you batting your eyes
at another fellow, I will...

563
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,276
<i>I'm walking on the air, dear</i>

564
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:40,471
<i>For life is fair, dear, to lovers</i>

565
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,430
<i>I'm in the seventh heaven</i>

566
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,275
<i>There's more than seven</i>

567
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,833
<i>My heart discovered</i>

568
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,594
<i>In this sweet, improbable</i>

569
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,151
<i>And unreal world</i>

570
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,596
<i>Finding you has given me</i>

571
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:12,632
<i>My ideal world</i>

572
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,236
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

573
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,437
<i>Why do you love me?</i>

574
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,876
<i>Why should there be two</i>

575
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,157
<i>Happy as we?</i>

576
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:32,509
<i>Can you see the why or wherefore</i>

577
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:39,438
<i>I should be the one you care for</i>

578
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,030
<i>You're a lucky boy</i>

579
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,839
<i>I am lucky too</i>

580
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,197
<i>- All our dreams of joy</i>
<i>- All our dreams of joy</i>

581
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,670
<i>- Seem to come true</i>
<i>- Seem to come true</i>

582
00:56:52,840 --> 00:57:00,838
<i>- Maybe that's because you love me</i>
<i>- Maybe that's because you love me</i>

583
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,398
<i>- Maybe that's why I love you</i>
<i>- Maybe that's why I love you</i>

584
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,276
Sorry. That's too much money.
I'd like the cash.

585
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,431
Very well.

586
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,390
Tonight, Ravenal.

587
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,949
I'll be back in a half an hour.

588
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,795
Don't worry, darling.

589
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,474
It's only temporary.

590
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,631
I'll get them back for you.

591
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,313
Everything could be temporary,
except us.

592
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,238
Get your things packed, honey.
I'll be right back.

593
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,516
Charlie.
Get me a cup of coffee, please.

594
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,238
Yes, sir.

595
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,392
- Get the coffee. I'll get the elevator.
- Okay, sir.

596
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,357
Hello, you.

597
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,995
You know, I've missed you.

598
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,631
Hot coffee. Now, that's a good bet.

599
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,678
- How were your others?
- How's that, honey?

600
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,833
Your other bets.
Yesterday's and last night's...

601
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,709
...and all of them "one last round
before we break it up" bets.

602
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,075
Were they just as good?

603
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,477
You got a crystal ball, darling?

604
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,632
My luck's sure been
running shallow lately.

605
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,197
That Loop crowd's tough,
but I'll get to them.

606
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,749
A lot of money goes through there.

607
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,837
Listen, Nolie.

608
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,789
I nearly hit the bonanza last night.

609
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,157
Now, we're in jacks or better,
and it goes to aces.

610
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,073
Now, I got two of them back to back.

611
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,834
Everybody drops out but Kirby.

612
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,398
My next two cards are queens.

613
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,113
I knew he was going into a flush,
but I had to stay in. Only l...

614
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,637
I felt that third queen coming out
of there just as sure as...

615
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,110
...well, just as sure...
- What does she look like?

616
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,999
- What, darling?
- The queen.

617
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,152
Does she look like
Cameo McQueen, for instance?

618
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,277
Nolie, if you think there's anything going
on with Cameo or any other woman...

619
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,638
I know there's no other woman.
No flesh and blood woman.

620
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,399
I almost wish there were.
I'd know how to fight then.

621
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,790
But I can't fight
this lady luck of yours.

622
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,875
This fancy queen
in her green-felt dress.

623
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,034
When you talked about it just now...

624
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,591
...I can't put that look in your eyes.
She's whipped me.

625
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,548
For days and nights now, weeks
and months, she's whipped me.

626
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,439
- I won't be whipped anymore. I won't!
- Nolie, hush, darling.

627
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,955
Nolie, look, tomorrow's Christmas...

628
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,634
...and I've still got a little bit left.
We could go...

629
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,189
Tomorrow isn't Christmas.
No, it isn't.

630
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,557
It's just like Papa said.
It's going to be Monday.

631
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,234
- It's all just like Papa said.
- Nolie.

632
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,914
You're a weak man, Gay.
You're weak. You're weak.

633
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,395
- You're weak...
- Nolie, I've stood enough of this.

634
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,790
Take your hands off me.

635
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,231
Well...

636
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,957
...we'll have to do something
about this, won't we?

637
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,557
Thank you.

638
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,915
Frank, we can afford better than this.

639
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,197
Sorry, I thought you were out and l...

640
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,112
- Nolie!
- Ellie!

641
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,794
- Look at her. How are you?
- I don't know two people...

642
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,155
- Doesn't she look wonderful?
...I'd rather see.

643
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,517
- How have you been? What's happened?
- We're booked into the Trocadero.

644
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,636
- The Trocadero?
- We open New Year's Eve.

645
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,837
- Wonderful. I'm so happy for you.
- We haven't been over there yet.

646
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,319
Don't know who's on the bill.

647
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,439
But just as soon as we could, we were
going to drop in on you over at the...

648
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,309
Andy said that you were living
at the Sherman House.

649
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,471
Are you living here?

650
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,597
- Just temporarily. Leaving?
- But you'll be leaving today, won't you?

651
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,512
These folks are looking for a place.

652
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,831
- Your husband told me a little while...
- There must be some mistake.

653
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,390
Oh, Gay. Gay, darling, get up
and come and see who's here.

654
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,515
Well, seeing as you
all know each other...

655
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,070
...I'll drop back later.

656
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,271
Oh, no.

657
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,672
What is it, Nolie?

658
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,551
"My darling...

659
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,029
...by the time you read this...

660
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,829
...I will be on a train heading west.

661
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,397
What you said was true
from the beginning.

662
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,994
This money will help you
get back home to those who love you.

663
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,357
Not as I will always love you...

664
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,512
...but surely and safely.

665
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,549
Remember our good times
and forget all the rest...

666
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,794
...so that at least
you will never hate me.

667
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,757
Gay."

668
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,357
Oh, Nolie.

669
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,511
Nolie.

670
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,110
See? Look.

671
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,671
"Hooray," said Tiny Tim,
"and a Merry Christmas to you all."

672
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,028
Oh, Gay. Oh, Gay.

673
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,555
All right, come on. Take it back.

674
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,028
Now, look. Lift it just as high as it
will go, so it's flush up against there.

675
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,069
- Mr. Green.
- Yeah, that's fine, kids.

676
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,198
- Is that the height you want it?
- Don't bother me now, Joe.

677
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,237
Julie, Julie.

678
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,597
Julie, come on. Let's get over there and
hear the new song, will you?

679
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,116
Would you do that in her dressing room?
I'm trying to put on a show.

680
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,669
But, Jake, this is a holiday season.

681
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,877
It's over for you, kiddo. Work.

682
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,270
You promised, remember?

683
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,829
That's a good girl.

684
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,195
What's the matter with her?

685
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,798
- She starting in on a bust again?
- She better not.

686
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,110
These fool one-man girls.

687
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,319
Their fellow walks out, and they tear
themselves apart till they hit bottom.

688
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,550
And I gotta suffer for it.

689
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,637
<i>Along came Bill</i>

690
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,792
<i>Who 's not the type at all</i>

691
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,111
<i>You'd meet him on the street</i>

692
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,192
<i>And never notice him</i>

693
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,790
<i>His form and face</i>

694
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,272
<i>His manly grace</i>

695
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,516
<i>Is not the kind that you</i>

696
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,396
<i>Would find in a statue</i>

697
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,234
<i>Oh, I can 't explain</i>

698
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,435
<i>It's surely not his brain</i>

699
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:14,389
<i>That makes me thrill</i>

700
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,870
<i>I love him because he's wonderful</i>

701
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:30,994
<i>Because he's just my Bill</i>

702
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,957
<i>I used to dream that I would discover</i>

703
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,915
<i>The perfect lover, some day</i>

704
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,674
<i>I knew I'd recognize him</i>

705
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:47,278
<i>If ever he came round my way</i>

706
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,835
<i>I always used to fancy that</i>

707
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,950
<i>He'd be one of the God-like kind of men</i>

708
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:05,230
<i>With a giant brain and a noble head</i>

709
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,549
<i>Like the heroes bold</i>

710
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,034
<i>In the books I've read</i>

711
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,957
<i>But along came Bill</i>

712
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,792
<i>An ordinary guy</i>

713
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,629
<i>He hasn 't got a thing</i>
<i>That I can brag about</i>

714
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:40,232
<i>And yet to be</i>
<i>Upon his knee</i>

715
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,230
<i>So comfy and roomy</i>

716
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,874
<i>Feels natural to me</i>

717
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,753
<i>Oh, I can 't explain</i>

718
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,190
<i>It's surely not his brain</i>

719
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:10,389
<i>That makes me thrill</i>

720
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,872
<i>I love him</i>

721
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,833
<i>Because he's</i>
<i>I don 't know</i>

722
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:34,320
<i>Because he's just my Bill</i>

723
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,438
Yeah, but can you keep her
off a bottle?

724
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,948
I'll try.

725
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,479
- Will that do, Simon Legree?
- Fine, Julie.

726
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,710
Now let's see the costume
for the finale, huh?

727
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,359
- Yes, massah.
- Attagirl.

728
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,238
- Yes, massah.
- That's right.

729
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,868
Yes, massah.

730
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,637
Come on, Julie. Come on,
come on, you kept us waiting for you.

731
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,631
- Mr. Green, can we do our number now?
- Yeah?

732
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,518
- A little later.
- We hope you like it.

733
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,193
- I will. Yeah?
- Mr. Green?

734
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,316
Would you sign for these, please?

735
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,514
- Hello, Schultz.
- How are you? Say, is that Mr. Green?

736
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,955
- Yeah, that's him. Right there.
- Thank you.

737
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,439
- Say, Mr. Green?
- Yeah.

738
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,592
Hi, Mr. Green. I'm Frank Schultz.
Schultz and Schultz.

739
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,318
Schultz and... Oh, the dance act.

740
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,311
Fine, yeah.
I'll be with you in a minute.

741
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,675
- We got great new routines for you.
- Fine. Fine.

742
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,434
We brought somebody
with us who we think has real talent.

743
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,113
- We'd like you to hear her.
- Yeah?

744
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,669
Nolie Ravenal. Nolie Hawks, that is.

745
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,958
- She sings. Like a nightingale.
- I already got a singer. Besides, l...

746
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,071
Take off your hat.

747
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,953
Yeah, I guess I got a few minutes.

748
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,792
What kind of songs do you sing?

749
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,191
Well, negro songs mostly,
and spirituals.

750
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,952
- Jazzbo singer, huh?
- Well, no, l...

751
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,758
- Yes, yes.
- It won't do any harm...

752
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,434
...to listen to her, Joe.
All right, go ahead.

753
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,511
I wrote it out myself.
I hope you'll be able to read it.

754
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,910
I'll make out, sister.

755
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,991
<i>Fish gotta swim</i>

756
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,869
<i>Birds gotta fly</i>

757
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,555
<i>I've gotta love</i>

758
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:40,475
<i>One man till I die</i>

759
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,949
Go hurry her nibs with that costume,
will you, Joe?

760
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:52,836
<i>Can 't help</i>
<i>Lovin ' that man of mine</i>

761
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,913
- Come on, Julie.
- I've been trying to get her to...

762
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,389
Yeah, Jake's getting all riled up
about everything.

763
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,471
- Just a minute.
- <i>Maybe I know</i>

764
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,234
- Who's that singing?
- Some gal the dance act brought in.

765
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,278
Look, Julie,
Jake wants to see this dress...

766
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,431
She's a pretty good looker,
but she needs the job bad, I guess.

767
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,034
- Needs a job? Why?
- Schultz said she was married...

768
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,112
...to some two-bit gambler
and he walked off and left her flat.

769
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,671
Us boys are all no good, you know that.
Come on, Julie. Bring the dress.

770
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,114
<i>That's a rainy day</i>

771
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,431
Julie, dear,
you've got to try this dress on.

772
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:40,359
<i>But when he comes back</i>
<i>The day is fine</i>

773
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,272
Come on, Julie.
Let's have the drink.

774
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,237
Shut up.

775
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:52,558
<i>The sun will shine</i>

776
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,274
<i>He can come home</i>

777
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,231
<i>As late as can be</i>

778
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,430
<i>Home without him</i>

779
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,436
<i>Ain 't no home to me</i>

780
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:26,239
<i>Can 't help loving that man of mine</i>

781
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,197
Well, how about it, Mr. Green?

782
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,636
Oh, not bad. Leave word
where we can reach you, honey.

783
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,597
Something may show up later, see?

784
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,149
- Charlie.
- Keep trying, sister. You'll make it.

785
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,276
- Thank you.
- You were super.

786
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,715
Well, you two certainly did your best.

787
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,359
Mr. Green, Julie's gone.

788
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,159
- What?
- I ran after her, all the way to the street.

789
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,756
She just laughed at me, right over
the top of a bottle. She's quitting.

790
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,639
- Well, what about my opening?
- She said if you don't hire...

791
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,995
...the little girl who just sang,
you're crazy.

792
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,435
- Why, that trampy little...
- I'll go get her, boss.

793
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,673
Let her go, the dirty worthless...
Hey, you with the hat.

794
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,115
Take it off.
Let's hear that number again.

795
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,559
Happy New Year!

796
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,391
Yes, sir, that's what
I said to Parthy.

797
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,838
I said, "I'm going to Chicago to see
Nolie and Gay for New Year's...

798
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,878
...whether you come or not."

799
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,838
You wear the trousers, eh, buster?

800
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,753
I wouldn't look good in skirts,
would I?

801
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,200
Happy New Year!

802
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,635
- Right this way, please.
- Right this way, he said.

803
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,677
Yes, sir, right this way.

804
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,190
Come on, ladies. Right here. Right now.

805
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,958
There we are.

806
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,279
- Champagne, sir?
- Champagne? Right.

807
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,756
Thank you. Fill the scuppers.

808
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,878
Happy New Year!

809
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,635
I guess your daughter has plenty of lucre
to be staying at the Sherman Hotel.

810
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,031
As a matter of fact,
they're not living there anymore.

811
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,988
Got a place of their own now.
Nolie never wrote me.

812
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,072
Figured she wanted to surprise me.

813
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,632
But I'm gonna surprise Nolie,
because Ellie and Frank...

814
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,075
...they're the top liners
on the bill here.

815
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,993
They'll know where she is, all right.

816
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,878
With the finish.

817
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,600
Happy New Year!

818
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,593
So you have a good excuse
for a night out on the town, buster?

819
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,072
Don't need any excuse.
This is New Year's Eve.

820
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,313
Happy New Year!

821
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,554
And now, the new sensational
dance duo, Schultz and Schultz.

822
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,635
That's Ellie. That's Ellie and Frank.
Wait'll you catch them.

823
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,839
I taught them everything
they know myself. Yes, sir.

824
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,031
There they are.

01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,188
<i>I admit it's fun</i>
<i>To smear my face with paint</i>

844
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,594
<i>Causing everyone</i>
<i>To think I'm what I ain 't</i>

845
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,910
<i>And I like to play</i>
<i>A demimonde role</i>

846
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,516
<i>With soul</i>

847
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,317
<i>Ask the hero does he</i>
<i>Like the way I lure</i>

848
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,116
<i>When I play a hussy</i>
<i>Or a paramour</i>

849
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,798
<i>But when once the curtain 's down</i>

850
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,509
<i>My life is pure</i>

851
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,037
<i>And how I dread it</i>

852
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:01,312
<i>Life upon the wicked stage</i>
<i>Ain 't never what a girl supposes</i>

853
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,552
<i>Stage-door Johnnies</i>
<i>Aren 't raging over you</i>

854
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,156
<i>With gems and roses</i>

855
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,154
<i>I've got talent</i>
<i>But it ain 't been tested</i>

856
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,714
<i>No one's even interested</i>

857
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:23,715
<i>Life upon the wicked stage</i>
<i>Ain 't nothing for a girl</i>

858
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:06,468
Hey, what did I tell you?
That's Ellie and Frank. More!

859
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,349
We want more of that, don't we?
Come on, boy.

860
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,636
Excuse me, girls.
If you don't mind, ladies...

861
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,509
...I'm going back and say hello to them.
Now, wait right here. Don't go away.

862
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,396
- But who will now charm you
with a popular new ballad.

863
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,630
First time on a Chicago stage.

864
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:27,311
That sweetheart of the Mississippi,
Miss Magnolia Ravenal.

865
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,593
Nolie.

866
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,552
<i>A little maiden</i>

867
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,198
<i>Climbed an old man 's knee</i>

868
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,919
- Can't hear you.
<i>- Begged for a story</i>

869
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,556
<i>- Do, uncle, please</i>
- Nolie.

870
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,557
<i>- Why are you single?</i>
- My baby.

871
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,277
<i>Why live alone?</i>

872
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,149
<i>- I had a sweetheart</i>
- Nolie.

873
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,635
<i>- Years and years ago</i>
- Here.

874
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,031
- Nolie, here.
- <i>Where she is now</i>

875
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,919
Take it back to the river.

876
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,033
Quiet!

877
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,954
Quiet! Quiet!

878
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,476
<i>I'll tell it all</i>

879
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,555
<i>I believed her faithless</i>

880
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,350
Nolie, remember what I told you.
Smile.

881
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,231
<i>After the ball is over</i>

882
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,356
<i>After the break of dawn</i>

883
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,957
<i>After the dancers leaving</i>

884
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,518
<i>After the stars are gone</i>

885
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,272
<i>Many a heart is aching</i>

886
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,158
<i>- lf you could read them all</i>
- Smile.

887
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,792
<i>Many the hopes that have vanished</i>

888
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,199
<i>After the ball</i>

889
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,877
- Oh, Papa.
<i>- After the ball is over</i>

890
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,909
<i>After the break of dawn</i>

891
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,516
<i>After the dancers leaving</i>

892
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,270
<i>After the stars are gone</i>

893
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,430
<i>Many a heart is aching</i>

894
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,276
<i>If you could read them all</i>

895
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,998
<i>Many the hopes that have vanished</i>

896
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:26,510
<i>After the ball</i>

897
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,552
Happy New Year!

898
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:38,953
<i>Should old acquaintance be forgot</i>

899
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:45,195
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

900
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:52,034
<i>Should old acquaintance be forgot</i>

901
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,793
<i>And days of auld lang syne</i>

902
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,797
And that's the way it is, Papa.

903
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,434
Just like you said. It's Monday.

904
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,833
Well, you'll just wanna forget him,
Nolie, darling.

905
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,356
- He's a scoundrel. A no-account.
- No, Papa, no, he isn't.

906
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,272
He was only trying to think of me.

907
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,193
Well, from now on, you can
just be thinking of yourself.

908
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,069
Why, after tonight, you're a big star.
You can go to New York.

909
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:32,314
No, I can't. No, I can't.
I can't just think of myself either.

910
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,156
I'm gonna have a baby.

911
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,518
Nolie.

912
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,992
Nolie.

913
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,311
You say he was thinking of you,
and he knew about this?

914
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:00,429
No, Papa. No, Gay never knew.
You see I was...

915
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,388
He was so worried
and so down that...

916
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,758
Well, I was waiting for things
to get better before I told him.

917
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,753
But I...

918
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,952
Don't worry, Papa.

919
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,908
I wanna come home.
If you'll have me.

920
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,870
If we'll have you?

921
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,917
Happy New Year!

922
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:26,470
Happy New Year!
Let's celebrate, everybody.

923
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,995
Here's to a happy new year.

924
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,872
It will be a happy new year, won't it?
It will be.

925
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,994
And what name do we put down
for the little lady?

926
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,392
Kim. That's her name. K-l-M.

927
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,232
Kim Hawks.

928
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,630
Kim Ravenal.

929
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:24,755
Kim Ravenal.

930
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,510
There she is.

931
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,276
That will be all of that.

932
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,190
- It seems to me, Hawks.
- Got a kiss for Grandpa?

933
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,157
Come to Grandma. Come on.
Your supper's ready.

934
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,880
You poor starved darling.

935
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,951
My goodness.

936
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,358
I think I'm gonna sing.

937
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,592
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Oh, quit it. Quit it.

938
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,351
Hey, lookit. You know this one?

939
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,710
<i>Fish gotta swim</i>
<i>Birds gotta fly</i>

940
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,510
<i>I gotta love</i>
<i>One man till I die</i>

941
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,679
<i>- Can 't...</i>
- Hey, Julie. Come on.

942
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,308
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, leave me alone, Dan.

943
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,872
Say, listen. Who bought your ticket?

944
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,550
That's rather untidy conduct,
my friend.

945
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,157
Oh, it is, huh?

946
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,397
Say, who do you think you're...?

947
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:49,479
No cause for worry, folks.
Just a little misunderstanding.

948
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,470
- You know what cabin he has?
- Two-eighteen.

949
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,634
- Thanks, mister.
- That's all right.

950
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,032
I don't know why... I mean, I don't
know why it should matter to you.

951
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,872
Somebody used to sing that song.

952
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,235
Somebody who mattered
to me very much.

953
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,231
Excuse me.

954
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,037
Thank you.

955
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,793
- Who is that fella?
- A fair-sized gambler.

956
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,678
He travels with us now and then.

957
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,515
- Say, he's got a fair-sized punch too.
- A gambler, huh?

958
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,112
- Name ain't Ravenal, is it?
- Yes. Gaylord Ravenal.

959
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,517
- So that's the no-good...
- Excuse me, ma'am?

960
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,871
- Give me a neat rye.
- Yes.

961
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,474
That's to get my courage up.

962
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:07,029
Natchez, 10 minutes.
Landing in Natchez in 10 minutes.

963
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,876
Ten minutes. Landing in Natchez.

964
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,031
Ten minutes. Natchez.

965
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,316
Nice place, Natchez.

966
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:21,072
- You getting off there?
- No. All the way to New Orleans.

967
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,832
Thought maybe Natchez, seeing
as there's a show boat tied up there.

968
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,711
No, still New Orleans.

969
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,754
I thought maybe
because you look like an actor.

970
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,553
Once I was. I admit to that.

971
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,468
I'm sorry.

972
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:39,154
- Is that all you're sorry about?
- You'd better turn in.

973
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,392
Maybe you're sorry
because you're some kind of rat.

974
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,035
All right, all right, so I'm a rat.
Now, go to bed.

975
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,079
Oh, no. Please, mister.
I was talking about myself maybe.

976
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,310
Lots of rats come off show boats.

977
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:59,076
On-stage, under stage,
sneaking off, kicked off.

978
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,758
Kicked off.

979
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:05,391
Taking things with them,
taking nothing.

980
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,516
Me, mister, I was on one once too.

981
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,796
Forget about it, honey.
Get some sleep.

982
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,349
She was so pretty and sweet.

983
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,553
So open-out trusting sweet.

984
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,154
Who? What are you talking about?

985
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:26,278
And you know something, mister?
Some big, soft-talking card player...

986
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,194
...came along and took her right off the
<i>Cotton Blossom</i>, where she belonged.

987
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,909
Then left her broke and alone in Chicago
when she was gonna have a baby.

988
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,877
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

989
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,315
Hey, Julie. For the love of...
Cut it, will you?

990
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,955
We gotta get off here.

991
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,671
Julie.

992
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,710
So you're...

993
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,871
- Look, what's that you said...?
- You wanna see what you left?

994
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,508
You wanna see them, mister?

995
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,670
I've kept track of them
ever since she was born.

996
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,351
Kim.

997
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,236
Kim Ravenal.

998
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,510
- Oh, Nolie.
- Now you see why I wish...

999
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,069
...you'd never been nice to me?
You see why, mister?

1000
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,516
Please, Julie. Take my oath.
I never knew.

1001
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,830
Hey, Julie!

1002
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,797
- You mean, honestly...?
- Please, Julie. Take my oath.

1003
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,996
Last call, kid.

1004
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,230
Look, I gotta go now.

1005
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,792
I hope I did right.

1006
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,077
I know there's always
two sides to everything.

1007
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,035
It's the whiskey maybe.

1008
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,472
Look, mister,
if you ever do get to see Nolie...

1009
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:01,156
...not get together with her, I mean,
but if you ever do get to talk to her...

1010
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,231
...don't ever tell her you saw me.

1011
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:07,916
I mean, don't ever tell her
you saw me like this.

1012
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,390
I won't, Julie.

1013
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:42,039
We get away from these noisy people.
We go to sleep in the woods.

1014
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,393
Hello.

1015
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,917
They're going to sleep now.
She always goes to sleep first.

1016
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,797
Is your name Kim?

1017
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,430
That's a very pretty name.

1018
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:07,069
- How did they call you Kim?
- It's a geographical name.

1019
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,468
Geographical?

1020
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,950
The stork dropped me
plop in the middle of the river.

1021
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,350
Right in the middle of the river?

1022
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,274
Right between Kentucky,
Illinois and Missouri.

1023
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,715
Oh, I see.

1024
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,793
K-l-M. That's very pretty.

1025
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,679
And did your mommy fish you out?

1026
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,549
No. My grandpa did.
He swims more better.

1027
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,712
Well, is your mommy here?

1028
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,836
Of course.

1029
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,234
And where's your daddy?

1030
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,994
- Right here.
- Here?

1031
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,549
- You mean...
- No, here.

1032
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:49,871
That's Nolie and this is Gay.

1033
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,235
Of course, he isn't my real daddy.

1034
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:58,475
He's far away someplace, so I just
play make-believe this is my daddy.

1035
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,076
Make-believe.

1036
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,032
Could you make-believe
that I was your daddy?

1037
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,278
You know how to play
make-believe?

1038
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,879
- Oh, sure.
- All right. You start.

1039
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,797
Well...

1040
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,678
...let's see.

1041
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:26,149
First of all, I'd put you up
on my knee like this.

1042
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,958
And then
I'd put my arms around you.

1043
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,797
And then I'd say:

1044
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,830
<i>Only make-believe</i>

1045
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:44,195
<i>I'm near you</i>

1046
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,556
<i>Only make-believe</i>

1047
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,917
<i>That you're with me</i>

1048
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,277
<i>Girls and boys</i>

1049
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:04,756
<i>Find it fun in pretending</i>

1050
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,958
<i>Couldn 't you?</i>

1051
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,513
<i>Couldn 't I?</i>

1052
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,072
<i>Couldn 't we?</i>

1053
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:20,272
Darling, look.

1054
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,069
If your daddy really did come back...

1055
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,470
...could you make-believe that...?

1056
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:31,715
Look, could you pretend
that he'd never been away?

1057
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,633
- Could you, sweetheart?
- Of course.

1058
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,997
<i>Best of all</i>

1059
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:47,955
<i>Make-believe I love you</i>

1060
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:53,475
<i>For to tell...</i>

1061
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,591
Kim.

1062
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,072
We were playing
make-believe, Mommy.

1063
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,072
This is my mommy.

1064
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,151
Kim, your grandpa's
getting ready to leave.

1065
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,754
You'd better go back onboard now.

1066
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,713
He plays it real wonderful.

1067
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,917
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1068
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,270
She's lovely.

1069
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,078
Yes. Yes, she is, isn't she?

1070
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,799
You look fine too, Nolie.

1071
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,998
Thank you, Gay.

1072
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,558
- Have things gone well for you?
- Yes, yes.

1073
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,477
I just happened to see
the picture and I...

1074
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,870
- Picture?
- Well, in the paper.

1075
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,033
And the article. I...

1076
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,111
Nolie, there's so much
that I want to say to you.

1077
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,116
- Nolie.
- Gay.

1078
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:41,672
<i>OI' man river</i>

1079
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,311
<i>That ol' man river</i>

1080
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,473
<i>He must know something</i>

1081
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:55,634
Parthy. Partheny.
Look! Look there.

1082
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,311
- I still have my eyesight.
- He's back.

1083
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,630
It's Saturday night again.

1084
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:05,796
It's Wednesday night,
and don't you strike me.

1085
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,076
It's Saturday night forever.

1086
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:16,834
Yes, and Fourth of July,
and Christmas...

1087
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,913
...and Happy New Year.

1088
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,192
Parthy.

1089
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:28,591
- Get the boat started. The people.
- Roll the wheel, Windy.

1090
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,959
<i>But ol' man river</i>

1091
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,072
Cast off the bow line.

1092
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,550
All right, Joe. On the stern there.

1093
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:54,110
<i>You and me, we sweat and strain</i>

1094
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,758
<i>Body all achin ' and racked with pain</i>

1095
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:04,514
<i>Tote that barge and lift that bale</i>

1096
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,918
<i>You get a little drunk</i>

1097
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:14,755
<i>And you lands in jail</i>

1098
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:21,677
<i>I get weary</i>

1099
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:26,595
<i>And sick of tryin '</i>

1100
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:31,515
<i>I'm tired of livin '</i>

1101
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:36,800
<i>And scared of dyin '</i>

1102
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:42,318
<i>But ol' man river</i>

1103
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:50,673
<i>He just keeps rollin '</i>

1104
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:59,672
